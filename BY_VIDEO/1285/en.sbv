I would like to have your attention and viewers all over the world

0:00:04.880,0:00:09.560
for a special message of the Prophet for you and the whole world

0:00:09.560,0:00:15.260
which I'm going to read, in Jesus'name.

0:00:15.260,0:00:24.560
Our Prophet will not be able to be with us today but he is with us in the Spirit.

0:00:24.560,0:00:32.640
Special Message From Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:32.640,0:00:36.180
As you know and you have watched on Emmanuel TV,

0:00:36.180,0:00:44.180
he has been praying for you, praying for me and praying for the whole world.

0:00:44.180,0:00:53.580
You will remember the message he said that this year will be a very fearful year.

0:00:53.580,0:00:59.980
You can imagine the revelation he has.

0:00:59.980,0:01:12.060
He has to pray for God to give him wisdom on how to present this message to the world at large.

0:01:12.060,0:01:17.260
He has a message now for the nation Nigeria.

0:01:17.260,0:01:19.540
Message for Nigeria:

0:01:19.540,0:01:29.600
Nigeria should fast and pray this coming Thursday (17-01-19) and next upper Wednesday (23-01-19).

0:01:29.600,0:01:37.960
We should pray so that God should change the bad happenings he sees to good.

0:01:37.960,0:01:43.040
He is not permitted to say exactly what will happen.

0:01:43.040,0:01:50.800
So let us pray and fast Thursday and next upper Wednesday.

0:01:50.800,0:01:59.380
This revelation will be read to you the moment God gives him the wisdom to present it to you.

0:01:59.380,0:02:05.020
It will be given to you; it will be presented to you, in Jesus' name.

0:02:05.020,0:02:07.220
Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:02:07.220,0:02:10.460
Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:02:10.460,0:02:15.760
Where God guides, He provides.
Where God guides, He protects.

0:02:15.760,0:02:17.700
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
