0:00:00.000,0:00:01.860
Brother, how are you?

0:00:01.860,0:00:05.020
Thank you!

0:00:05.020,0:00:06.680
What happened to this building?

0:00:06.680,0:00:11.520
The building just 'hooked up' just like that because of the enemies; my father's people.

0:00:11.520,0:00:13.500
The building just what?

0:00:13.500,0:00:18.580
It 'hooked up' since 2008 after I roofed it.

0:00:18.580,0:00:22.380
Immediately you started that building, everything, including your business, just collapsed.

0:00:22.380,0:00:23.980
Yes.

0:00:23.980,0:00:30.460
Because we should ask God before making an attempt or step forward to do something.

0:00:30.460,0:00:36.400
Money should not be the one to control our spiritual life; we should allow the Giver of money to control us.

0:00:36.400,0:00:39.780
Sometimes you want to go to the village and do something,

0:00:39.780,0:00:44.580
instead of you to stay still, prepare your life and be strong in the Lord.

0:00:44.580,0:00:46.780
Suddenly, one collapses there.

0:00:46.780,0:00:51.280
So, there is need to ask God in every step that we are taking.

0:00:51.280,0:00:53.320
What about this court case?

0:00:53.320,0:00:55.600
It has gone.

0:00:55.600,0:00:59.640
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:00:59.640,0:01:03.220
Go and call your wife because I am seeing a baby boy.

0:01:03.220,0:01:04.380
She is not here!

0:01:04.380,0:01:06.340
Dont worry!

0:01:07.080,0:01:10.800
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:10.800,0:01:18.300
People of God, Emmanuel! {God With Us - Matthew 1:23}

0:01:18.300,0:01:22.260
I thank God for being here today,

0:01:22.260,0:01:27.520
and I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God, the prophet of our time.

0:01:27.520,0:01:34.320
Without the prophecy of the man of God, I don't know where I would have been.

0:01:34.320,0:01:38.000
A nation without a prophet is finished!

0:01:38.000,0:01:41.540
A country without a prophet is finished!

0:01:41.540,0:01:42.800
It happened like this:

0:01:42.800,0:01:51.240
My name is Mr Michael Ugwu and the woman beside me is my lovely wife,

0:01:51.240,0:01:56.880
Mrs Favour Ugwu, and my son Peter Ugwu.

0:01:56.880,0:02:08.500
On the 27th of April 2014, I was sitting in the church and the Man of God was prophesying.

0:02:08.500,0:02:20.400
Luckily for me, he came across me and asked me, "What about that house? What happened?"

0:02:20.400,0:02:26.720
I told him that I went into that project, I got connected.

0:02:26.720,0:02:33.180
Then, temptations were all around me and many problems.

0:02:33.180,0:02:37.880
He also asked me about the court case, it's all about my land.

0:02:37.880,0:02:41.840
I was living outside Nigeria before.

0:02:41.840,0:02:47.460
This land - the people who sold it to me wanted to take it back from me again.

0:02:47.460,0:02:51.980
After that, it was like he wanted to leave me then he asked, "Where is your wife?"

0:02:51.980,0:02:54.360
I told him that my wife was not there.

0:02:54.360,0:02:59.280
I didn't know that as I was here, my wife was in the house watching Emmanuel TV!

0:02:59.280,0:03:03.400
That is the only TV station we watch in our house.

0:03:03.400,0:03:07.980
The Man of God said to me, "I am seeing a baby boy".

0:03:07.980,0:03:12.840
I never told the man of God my problem, that we were barren.

0:03:12.840,0:03:15.580
We were barren for six years.

0:03:15.580,0:03:23.880
I met my wife in 2011; since we met as husband and wife, there has been no child.

0:03:23.880,0:03:29.420
We faced the problem of barrenness for six years.

0:03:29.420,0:03:38.300
Luckily for me, on that fateful day, my problem came to an end.

0:03:38.300,0:03:40.980
The Man of God said, "I am seeing a baby boy."

0:03:40.980,0:03:48.420
I held onto that word in faith and I believed that that day my problem was over.

0:03:48.420,0:03:51.560
Could you imagine...

0:03:51.560,0:03:59.620
When I got back to my house, I prayed with my wife with the Morning Water.

0:03:59.620,0:04:09.260
I met with my wife and suddenly my wife became pregnant.

0:04:09.260,0:04:12.140
I couldn't believe it.

0:04:12.140,0:04:17.900
I was like, "It's not me". My wife said, "I am pregnant".

0:04:17.900,0:04:21.480
I said, "No, you are not pregnant".

0:04:21.480,0:04:27.640
Since then, everything has just been (well).

0:04:27.640,0:04:31.880
After nine months, my wife delivered our baby peacefully.

0:04:31.880,0:04:49.200
She was having multiple fibroids, and the doctor said he would operate her.

0:04:49.200,0:04:59.140
My wife said no; rather, she believed in the Morning Water from The SCOAN.

0:04:59.140,0:05:07.340
My wife anointed herself with the Morning Water.

0:05:07.340,0:05:10.720
To my surprise, she delivered this bouncing baby boy.

0:05:10.720,0:05:18.580
This is the baby boy the man of God talked about when he said, "I'm seeing a baby boy".

0:05:18.580,0:05:21.500
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:21.500,0:05:26.380
Testimony Time

0:05:26.380,0:05:30.420
Since then, my life has changed.

0:05:30.420,0:05:35.500
Since we had our baby boy, a lot of blessings and doors have opened in my business.

0:05:35.500,0:05:41.300
In the last three weeks, I bought this car.

0:05:41.300,0:05:53.060
I bought this car for them to use, showing appreciation for what God is doing in my family and my life.

0:05:53.060,0:05:57.940
Since then, a lot of doors have opened - contacts.

0:05:57.940,0:06:00.720
I don't know what to say!

0:06:00.720,0:06:03.000
Testimony Time

0:06:03.000,0:06:05.180
Amen. Indeed, a million thanks are not enough!

0:06:05.180,0:06:07.820
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:06:07.820,0:06:10.840
Testimony Time

0:06:10.840,0:06:15.960
In that word of prophecy, the man of God first of all mentioned the issue of a building.

0:06:15.960,0:06:20.300
Can you explain to us - after the prophecy, what has happened concerning that building?

0:06:20.300,0:06:25.960
After receiving the prophecy about my buildings - there were two buildings.

0:06:25.960,0:06:30.900
I had not even roofed the buildings because money to pay for roofers was a problem.

0:06:30.900,0:06:35.200
I had a lot of jobs to do for that project but I could not get them finished.

0:06:35.200,0:06:44.740
After the prophecy, how it happened I don't know, I was able to finish everything.

0:06:44.740,0:06:53.760
I did not come with the picture because I did not know that I would be here today to give this testimony.

0:06:53.760,0:06:56.760
So you mean that the building that the man of God prophesied about

0:06:56.760,0:07:00.600
that everything had stopped, you have now completed it and it is finished.

0:07:00.600,0:07:02.680
It is finished, everything is finished!

0:07:02.680,0:07:05.780
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:07:05.780,0:07:08.380
Testimony Time

0:07:08.380,0:07:12.840
Sir, when you saw your wife deliver this baby boy,

0:07:12.840,0:07:17.680
were you not surprised considering that Prophet T.B. Joshua gave you this prophecy

0:07:17.680,0:07:24.100
when your wife was not pregnant and told you the exact gender of the child in her womb that was going to come.

0:07:24.100,0:07:29.260
Were you not shocked when your wife delivered and you saw that it was a baby boy?

0:07:29.260,0:07:32.920
That is why we are here because I am surprised.

0:07:32.920,0:07:36.680
Even though the Man of God did not know my problem,

0:07:36.680,0:07:40.840
he prophesied to me, "I am seeing a baby boy".

0:07:40.840,0:07:48.300
After that prophecy, I was surprised when my wife delivered

0:07:48.300,0:07:51.900
this beautiful baby boy, by my side here.

0:07:51.900,0:07:56.020
I am surprised. I thank God!

0:07:56.020,0:07:58.960
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:07:58.960,0:08:04.800
That is the power of the prophetic word. We can all be a witness to this

0:08:04.800,0:08:10.000
that it can only be by the hand of God that can reveal something of this nature.

0:08:10.000,0:08:15.980
The sex of a child that had not at that time even entered the womb of our brother's wife,

0:08:15.980,0:08:20.960
the Man of God prophesied and it came to pass, and we give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:08:20.960,0:08:25.080
At this point, we want to hear a word from your wife as well.

0:08:25.080,0:08:28.760
People of God, Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:28.760,0:08:31.920
My name is Mrs Favour Ugwu.

0:08:31.920,0:08:35.500
I want to thank God for the prophecy.

0:08:35.500,0:08:41.420
That day, I was at home. When he asked, "Where is your wife?",

0:08:41.420,0:08:43.200
I was in the parlour watching him.

0:08:43.200,0:08:46.420
He asked, "Where is your wife?" He said, "My wife is at home".

0:08:46.420,0:08:49.480
He then said, "I see a baby boy coming".

0:08:49.480,0:08:51.760
I jumped up and started shouting.

0:08:51.760,0:08:55.600
Immediately, I dressed up and started coming here.

0:08:55.600,0:09:03.240
When I reached here, he prayed for us; that was in 2014.

0:09:03.240,0:09:09.300
We continued praying and at the end of the year 2015, I conceived.

0:09:09.300,0:09:16.600
During the pregnancy, I did not bother to go to the hospital for tests or scans.

0:09:16.600,0:09:22.740
I didn't bother to go because I was sure that what the Man of God said was true.

0:09:22.740,0:09:27.560
At the eighth month, I went for a scan. By then, I had finished buying everything.

0:09:27.560,0:09:32.620
People were asking me why I was buying only male things and not female's.

0:09:32.620,0:09:36.440
I told them that I was sure of what I was buying because God had already said it.

0:09:36.440,0:09:39.780
Even the doctor questioned why I did not want to go for the scan, saying that I was stingy.

0:09:39.780,0:09:43.760
I said I was not stingy but the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua had already said it.

0:09:43.760,0:09:47.200
He told my husband, "This is a baby boy coming".

0:09:47.200,0:09:49.260
Before then, I was praying for a baby girl.

0:09:49.260,0:09:52.720
But immediately he said it, I removed my mind from it.

0:09:52.720,0:09:57.380
I was buying clothes for a male child.

0:09:57.380,0:10:02.780
That day, the doctor asked me to go for a scan but I said that I didn't want to.

0:10:02.780,0:10:07.240
At the eighth month, I went for a scan so that I would have a copy of it.

0:10:07.240,0:10:11.580
Before then, the doctor said that I would go for an operation because he saw a fibroid.

0:10:11.580,0:10:13.840
I said, "No, I will not go for an operation".

0:10:13.840,0:10:15.000
He asked why.

0:10:15.000,0:10:17.980
I said that I did not want to go for an operation.

0:10:17.980,0:10:20.160
He said that I should go for an operation that I should sign

0:10:20.160,0:10:22.180
but I said that I would not sign anything.

0:10:22.180,0:10:24.860
The day that I delivered the baby,

0:10:24.860,0:10:28.240
my husband dropped me at the hospital and I told him that he should go.

0:10:28.240,0:10:30.780
I was holding my Morning Water.

0:10:30.780,0:10:37.540
Before he got back, I delivered my baby and also the fibroids finally came out.

0:10:37.540,0:10:41.340
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:41.340,0:10:44.800
You mean you delivered safely without any operation

0:10:44.800,0:10:49.200
and as the child came out, the fibroid also came out at that moment?

0:10:49.200,0:10:50.040
Yes.

0:10:50.040,0:10:56.160
I used the Morning Water all over my body and prayed.

0:10:56.160,0:10:59.540
Before my husband came, I had already delivered the baby successfully.

0:10:59.540,0:11:03.340
They called him on the phone and when he came, he was screaming and shouting.

0:11:03.340,0:11:07.640
He said, "Are you sure he is my boy?" I said, "Yes, he is your son".

0:11:07.640,0:11:12.060
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!

0:11:12.060,0:11:17.860
Generally, madam: Just tell us - how have your lives changed since that word of prophecy,

0:11:17.860,0:11:21.120
both in terms of finances and the breakthrough that has come.

0:11:21.120,0:11:26.200
What can you testify about the changes that you and your husband have seen ever since then?

0:11:26.200,0:11:31.720
Our lives have really changed because that year, I was able to go for my youth service.

0:11:31.720,0:11:35.280
which was delayed since 2012.

0:11:35.280,0:11:44.020
There have been breakthroughs in our lives and also his business changed.

0:11:44.020,0:11:47.790
Thank You, Jesus Christ. Indeed, a million thanks are not enough

0:11:47.790,0:11:50.640
as the evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.

0:11:50.640,0:11:53.740
Now, madam, we can see a couple of documents on the board,

0:11:53.740,0:11:56.600
aside the picture of the car that your husband bought you.

0:11:56.600,0:12:03.360
Can you just show us what these documents are and what they are representing.

0:12:03.360,0:12:08.740
This is the scan showing that I was pregnant at eight months.

0:12:08.740,0:12:11.940
This is 'SY', showing that it is a male child.

0:12:11.940,0:12:16.620
These are the fibroids - the big one and the small one.

0:12:16.620,0:12:19.220
This is when I was pregnant

0:12:19.220,0:12:24.160
This is the car we were able to buy on December 10th.

0:12:24.160,0:12:29.740
Thank You, Jesus Christ! Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!

0:12:29.740,0:12:33.940
In the light of what Jesus Christ has done for you and your husband,

0:12:33.940,0:12:39.180
what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?

0:12:39.180,0:12:44.460
My advice to the viewers is that they should believe in God.

0:12:44.460,0:12:48.840
The God who blessed me will bless you too, in Jesus' name.

0:12:48.840,0:12:53.300
Amen. Let's put our hands together for  Christ Jesus!

0:12:53.300,0:12:59.140
Sir, finally, your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world.

0:12:59.140,0:13:03.260
My advice to the viewers all over the world is that they should believe in prophecies.

0:13:03.260,0:13:06.960
Believe in whatever the Man of God tells you.

0:13:06.960,0:13:13.680
If I did not have faith in that prophecy, I do not know how it would have turned out.

0:13:13.680,0:13:23.300
My advice to the whole world is to be always faithful in all your endeavours

0:13:23.300,0:13:27.680
and believe in God. He will see you through your predicaments.

0:13:27.680,0:13:32.480
Amen. One more time, let's put our hands together for Christ Jesus!

0:13:32.480,0:13:37.880
We also just want to hear a final word from our sister here because we haven't spoken to her yet.

0:13:37.880,0:13:41.880
Sister, can you just introduce yourself to us, tell us who you are to this family

0:13:41.880,0:13:45.800
and just tell us a word that you want to say about their testimony.

0:13:45.800,0:13:48.360
Praise the Lord!

0:13:48.360,0:13:52.200
My name is Nneka.

0:13:52.200,0:13:58.000
I really thank God for the life of my sister, for what God has done for her.

0:13:58.000,0:14:02.040
I really thank God. I appreciate God because it was not easy.

0:14:02.040,0:14:08.880
Anybody who has not passed through barrenness will not understand the meaning of barrenness.

0:14:08.880,0:14:13.080
There is no peace in the marriage when there is no child

0:14:13.080,0:14:20.980
but God did it for her and I am here to thank God for what He has done for her.

0:14:20.980,0:14:25.960
Amen. Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!

0:14:25.960,0:14:31.240
We pray that God will give this family the grace to raise up this child in the ways of the Lord

0:14:31.240,0:14:37.040
so as he grows up, he shall not depart from it and we know that the best is yet to come in Jesus' name.
