0:00:00.000,0:00:01.160
My name is Ms Rebecca.

0:00:01.160,0:00:02.640
I'm from Ghana.

0:00:02.640,0:00:06.780
I have needles in my body and have been operated on several times.

0:00:06.780,0:00:08.080
I am still not okay.

0:00:08.080,0:00:12.260
The doctors have removed 18 needles but I am still not okay.

0:00:12.260,0:00:14.060
That is the reason why I'm here.

0:00:14.060,0:00:17.200
I know through Christ I am going to be healed.

0:00:17.200,0:00:20.960
Where are those needles in your body?

0:00:20.960,0:00:23.420
These are the scars.

0:00:23.420,0:00:24.440
They operated on you?

0:00:24.440,0:00:25.100
Yes.

0:00:25.100,0:00:27.240
Let's see.

0:00:27.240,0:00:29.960
These are the places where they removed the needles?

0:00:29.960,0:00:32.740
Yes, these are the places where the needles were removed from.

0:00:32.740,0:00:36.460
But each place where they removed the needles - what happened to the place?

0:00:36.460,0:00:40.980
In the same place, they would still find needles, up to five.

0:00:40.980,0:00:42.480
Inside the same spot?

0:00:42.480,0:00:43.040
Yes.

0:00:43.040,0:00:44.380
Immediately they stitched it?

0:00:44.380,0:00:45.360
Yes.

0:00:45.360,0:00:47.280
So how many needles have they removed?

0:00:47.280,0:00:48.540
About eighteen.

0:00:48.540,0:00:52.340
Can we see the needles that they removed.

0:00:52.340,0:00:56.760
These are some of the needles.

0:00:56.760,0:00:58.480
And they have removed how many of these?

0:00:58.480,0:00:59.580
Eighteen.

0:00:59.580,0:01:00.380
Eighteen?

0:01:00.380,0:01:01.060
Yes.

0:01:01.060,0:01:04.140
Can you tell us how many needles are in your body now.

0:01:04.140,0:01:06.340
I can't tell how many are left.

0:01:06.340,0:01:08.960
Let's see the X-ray.

0:01:08.960,0:01:10.900
This is the X-ray.

0:01:10.900,0:01:23.540
You can see those lines - they are the needles.

0:01:23.540,0:01:27.620
This is where they removed the needles from.

0:01:27.620,0:01:30.500
Why did they stop removing them?

0:01:30.500,0:01:33.920
The spot where they removed needles, five would enter.

0:01:33.920,0:01:35.400
Is that the reason why they stopped?

0:01:35.400,0:01:36.560
Yes.

0:01:36.560,0:01:40.800
They stopped removing the needles because at each spot where they removed needles,

0:01:40.800,0:01:43.520
by the time they stitched it, five would enter.

0:01:43.520,0:01:47.080
Whenever they removed a needle from a particular place,

0:01:47.080,0:01:53.180
the following week, when I went for an X-ray, they would find 5 more needles.

0:01:53.180,0:01:54.160
In the same spot?

0:01:54.160,0:01:55.400
Yes.

0:01:55.400,0:02:00.560
Can we see the medical report, the statement given to you from the doctor.

0:02:00.560,0:02:02.560
This is the medical report.

0:02:02.560,0:02:05.460
It is from a specialist from the Ghanuba Clinic, Accra.

0:02:05.460,0:02:11.540
The doctor asked me to bring it here because it was beyond his understanding.

0:02:11.540,0:02:14.820
So, the medical report here is from Ghanuba Clinic.

0:02:14.820,0:02:17.940
It is written, "To whom it may concern.

0:02:17.940,0:02:21.980
Dear sir or madam; a medical report concerning Rebecca Idi.

0:02:21.980,0:02:25.940
The above patient has been under my care since last year.

0:02:25.940,0:02:29.200
She reported with chronic abdominal pain.

0:02:29.200,0:02:33.760
Diagnosis of umbilical hernia was made for which she was operated.

0:02:33.760,0:02:38.220
About about one month, she reported with abdominal pain

0:02:38.220,0:02:42.700
and this time a swelling was noted above the umbilicus, in the midline.

0:02:42.700,0:02:47.740
This was interpreted as epigastric hernia and was again operated

0:02:47.740,0:02:51.900
and this time a needle was retrieved from the site.

0:02:51.900,0:02:55.140
She reported again with the same pain.

0:02:55.140,0:03:00.600
An X-ray conducted revealed multiple needles on the X-ray film.

0:03:00.600,0:03:07.160
So far I have surgically removed about twelve of the needles from the abdominal wall.

0:03:07.160,0:03:12.020
A follow-up X-ray still reveals the presence of such needles.

0:03:12.020,0:03:15.460
This is beyond my understanding.

0:03:15.460,0:03:19.840
Any help offered her is therefore highly appreciated.

0:03:19.840,0:03:26.300
Dr Twumasi, a Senior Surgeon at Ghanuba Clinic in Ghana.

0:03:26.300,0:03:33.980
There are now 1000 needles in the body.

0:03:33.980,0:03:35.760
How many have they removed?

0:03:35.760,0:03:37.480
They removed eighteen.

0:03:37.480,0:03:40.780
You have seen the spots where they removed them.

0:03:40.780,0:03:47.680
At each spot, one was removed and almost five entered back.

0:03:47.680,0:03:49.680
What do you want to say about this?

0:03:49.680,0:03:55.980
What I want to educate you about this is that

0:03:55.980,0:04:03.420
when you remove it physically, you double the problem.

0:04:03.420,0:04:14.100
Because it was commanded in by incantation - evil spirit,

0:04:14.100,0:04:17.300
it must also be commanded out by the Holy Spirit.

0:04:24.400,0:04:33.660
It is not something you are supposed to see with your naked eyes.

0:04:33.660,0:04:40.120
The people that are doing this do not carry the needles and throw them

0:04:40.120,0:04:43.700
or put it in the food or drink.

0:04:43.700,0:04:53.560
They command it, and it enters invisibly.

0:04:53.560,0:04:59.120
We are not fighting the flesh and blood.

0:04:59.120,0:05:03.540
The command is not by throwing it or giving food or poison.

0:05:03.540,0:05:17.220
If a situation has become a curse - this is a curse - who can remove the curse?

0:05:17.220,0:05:19.200
This is why He was crucified.

0:05:19.200,0:05:21.860
He died on the cross.

0:05:21.860,0:05:28.760
They command it in by the power of evil spirit

0:05:28.760,0:05:39.840
and we command that thing out in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:05:39.840,0:05:42.040
The thing was not commanded three times.

0:05:42.040,0:05:48.800
It was commanded once by the power of evil spirit and thousands entered.

0:05:48.800,0:05:50.960
It is not one at a time that they command.

0:05:50.960,0:05:53.140
Evil spirit, take it.

0:05:53.140,0:05:53.640
No.

0:05:53.640,0:05:58.760
The whole thing; thousands were commanded and thousands entered.

0:05:58.760,0:06:04.320
A just mere opening of our lips, calling the name of Jesus,

0:06:04.320,0:06:13.620
the whole thousand too will disappear.

0:06:13.620,0:06:17.140
Little girl, had you ever experienced this in the family?

0:06:17.140,0:06:22.480
Maybe needles are a generational curse in your family.

0:06:22.480,0:06:25.020
People have needles in their body when they are born.

0:06:25.020,0:06:28.320
Or does any person have needles in his body?

0:06:28.320,0:06:32.280
I am the only person having this problem in the family.

0:06:32.280,0:06:34.220
You see the way she talks.

0:06:34.220,0:06:37.400
Some of those needles are close to her heart.

0:06:37.400,0:06:39.860
It is just everywhere in her body.

0:06:39.860,0:06:42.720
You said you are the only person in the family?

0:06:42.720,0:06:44.020
Yes.

0:06:44.020,0:06:46.980
How did this thing enter your body?

0:06:46.980,0:06:49.380
I don't know how they got into my body.

0:06:49.380,0:06:53.920
The doctor gave me a magnet to be rubbing on my tummy

0:06:53.920,0:06:58.040
so that they could come up to the skin surface for them to cut.

0:06:58.040,0:06:59.460
Ok.

0:06:59.460,0:07:01.820
Each time the doctor wants to remove them,

0:07:01.820,0:07:03.440
he will give you a magnet?

0:07:03.440,0:07:05.480
Yes, I have the magnet in the house.

0:07:05.480,0:07:08.200
The magnet that magnetised the needles?

0:07:08.200,0:07:09.060
Yes.

0:07:09.060,0:07:11.820
You then used a magnet to rub your body?

0:07:11.820,0:07:13.820
Then, it would come up to the skin.

0:07:13.820,0:07:18.280
I would go to the hospital for them to cut and remove the needles.

0:07:18.280,0:07:20.180
My God.

0:07:20.180,0:07:21.860
She will meet me at the prayer line.

0:07:21.860,0:07:23.900
Man of God, please help me.

0:07:23.900,0:07:27.020
Because of this situation, I couldn't complete my education

0:07:27.020,0:07:32.340
and I am always at home, suffering all the time.

0:07:32.340,0:07:40.720
As you are standing now, can you point to where you suspect the needles?

0:07:40.720,0:07:44.760
From this side to my pelvis.

0:07:44.760,0:07:48.600
It is all right.

0:07:48.600,0:07:51.620
She said she can locate some here.

0:07:51.620,0:07:53.440
Man of God, please help me.

0:07:53.440,0:07:56.500
I don't want to go for surgery anymore.

0:07:56.500,0:08:01.820
If God sent me to this lady today, I will be the most delighted person here.

0:08:01.820,0:08:04.940
To see how this girl will be free.

0:08:04.940,0:08:09.940
Those needles in the body - just like that eventually.

0:08:09.940,0:08:17.780
The person who did that will be brought to book.

0:08:17.780,0:08:31.160
What other efforts did you make in trying to remove the needles in your body?

0:08:31.160,0:08:33.740
Through traditional healers.

0:08:33.740,0:08:35.280
Are you a Christian?

0:08:35.280,0:08:35.820
Yes, sir.

0:08:35.820,0:08:36.960
Give it to the sister.

0:08:36.960,0:08:39.020
My name is Ms Julia Kujah.

0:08:39.020,0:08:41.460
I brought her from Ghana.

0:08:41.460,0:08:44.840
Her father works for me.

0:08:44.840,0:08:48.800
She has been in and out of hospitals and had several surgeries done.

0:08:48.800,0:08:52.620
The more surgeries they did, the more needles they found.

0:08:52.620,0:08:57.540
Her father recently came to me and said someone introduced him to a traditional healer

0:08:57.540,0:08:58.920
and that he wanted to take her there.

0:08:58.920,0:09:02.940
I told him not to but he was desperate.

0:09:02.940,0:09:06.100
I couldn't stop him because that was his child.

0:09:06.100,0:09:07.300
Then, he went.

0:09:07.300,0:09:13.300
He told me that the traditional healer used an egg to rub her body.

0:09:13.300,0:09:19.060
The needles entered the egg; they broke it and took the needles out.

0:09:19.060,0:09:24.800
I told him that he was going to compound this girl's problems,

0:09:24.800,0:09:30.780
that it was spiritual, created by satan and only Jesus could save her.

0:09:30.780,0:09:38.300
He came back to me a few days later and said he had thought about what I had said.

0:09:38.300,0:09:44.040
I told him, "Persuade the doctor so he will be willing to give you a medical report.

0:09:44.040,0:09:48.000
Then, we will go to the arena of liberty; I know Jesus can heal her".

0:09:48.000,0:09:52.060
That is how far we have come.

0:09:52.060,0:09:56.500
Can you see the huge challenges we have now.

0:09:56.500,0:10:03.260
We have made the name Jesus unpopular.

0:10:03.260,0:10:05.760
Nobody believes again.

0:10:05.760,0:10:11.120
Before people can come to Jesus, it means there is nowhere else to go.

0:10:11.120,0:10:14.580
They might have gone far and spent a fortune.

0:10:14.580,0:10:15.700
I asked if she is a Christian.

0:10:15.700,0:10:17.060
She said she is a Christian.

0:10:17.060,0:10:21.360
But she never thought of going to a man of God.

0:10:21.360,0:10:24.920
Did you pray over this thing?

0:10:24.920,0:10:28.860
Yes, we have.

0:10:28.860,0:10:32.340
We have been to so many churches.

0:10:32.340,0:10:37.860
Yes, they have been to many churches for prayer and deliverance but to no avail.

0:10:37.860,0:10:44.400
There is no other way for medical doctors but to recommend surgery

0:10:44.400,0:10:47.900
and they would have to operate on the whole body.

0:10:47.900,0:10:53.900
As you operate and stitch, five will go back at the same spot.

0:10:53.900,0:11:06.200
It is a sign to tell us that there are powers that cause people to bow down.

0:11:06.200,0:11:09.120
My sister, don't worry.

0:11:09.120,0:11:12.680
God asked you to come here and I know the same God will deliver you.

0:11:12.680,0:11:14.660
Amen.

0:11:14.660,0:11:16.620
That is it.

0:11:16.620,0:11:19.260
Let us wait for God's time.

0:11:19.260,0:11:22.660
At God's time which I know will be now.

0:11:22.660,0:11:35.380
HEALING TIME

0:11:35.900,0:11:41.940
21-year-old Ms Rebecca Idi has come all the way from Ghana to The SCOAN

0:11:41.940,0:11:45.540
with an unusual problem of needles in her body.

0:11:45.540,0:11:50.800
She had been operated on several times where a total of 18 needles were removed.

0:11:50.800,0:11:57.080
This is the X-ray that shows the numerous needles that are still inside her body, despite the surgeries.

0:11:57.080,0:12:01.920
This is a medical report from a hospital in Ghana that attested to their inability

0:12:01.920,0:12:07.180
to provide a permanent solution, despite many treatments and surgeries.

0:12:07.180,0:12:11.380
Here are some of the needles that were removed by the doctors through surgery.

0:12:11.380,0:12:16.620
After these needles were removed through operation, the doctors did a follow-up X-ray

0:12:16.620,0:12:21.640
and to their surprise, it showed the presence of even more needles in her body.

0:12:21.640,0:12:28.140
The doctors were completely mystified by the case and made a decision to no longer take any action.

0:12:28.140,0:12:33.920
This problem has indeed gone beyond the power of nature, beyond medical science and technology.

0:12:33.920,0:12:35.720
It has become a curse.

0:12:35.720,0:12:37.900
Who can remove the curse?

0:12:37.900,0:12:39.840
Only Jesus Christ.

0:12:39.840,0:12:45.300
Prophet T.B. Joshua, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, has been used by Jesus Christ

0:12:45.300,0:12:48.600
to break every curse in the lives of the people.

0:12:48.600,0:12:54.760
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, every mountain, curse and chain is being removed

0:12:54.760,0:12:59.720
and they are restored back to the original position God Almighty created them.

0:12:59.720,0:13:02.980
Among those being prayed for at the prayer line is Ms Rebecca Idi,

0:13:02.980,0:13:05.280
with the problem of needles in her body.

0:13:05.280,0:13:06.420
Man of God, please help me.

0:13:06.420,0:13:07.640
My name is Ms Rebecca.

0:13:07.640,0:13:08.340
I am from Ghana.

0:13:08.340,0:13:11.740
I have needles in my body and they keep on pricking me all the time.

0:13:11.740,0:13:14.140
Please help me, Man of God.

0:13:14.140,0:13:17.760
I have needles in my body and they keep on pricking me all the time.

0:13:17.760,0:13:19.180
Please help me.

0:13:19.180,0:13:20.860
The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line

0:13:20.860,0:13:22.360
Man of God, please help me.

0:13:30.880,0:13:32.200
Man of God, please help me.

Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:13:43.880,0:13:44.780
You are free.

0:13:44.780,0:13:48.320
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:13:48.320,0:13:49.660
Thank You, Lord, I am free!

0:13:49.660,0:13:50.900
Thank You, Jesus!

0:13:50.900,0:13:54.220
Thank You, Jesus, I am free!

0:13:54.220,0:14:00.680
Thank You, Lord, I am free!

0:14:00.680,0:14:05.920
It is not something you would not know.

0:14:05.920,0:14:08.460
She herself should know whether she is free.

0:14:08.460,0:14:12.020
It is not just issue of, "By faith, I am free".

0:14:12.020,0:14:16.340
Because the pain is there; she feels the pain, the needles, everything.

0:14:16.340,0:14:18.900
Take her somewhere and let her check herself.

0:14:18.900,0:14:21.960
Give her two to five minutes to check and then come back.

0:14:21.960,0:14:23.000
The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line

0:14:23.000,0:14:29.180
The thing came by evil spirit and we have to command it out by Holy Spirit.

0:14:29.180,0:14:31.320
This is a test to our faith.

0:14:31.320,0:14:35.640
If there is anything called miracle, this is a miracle.

0:14:35.640,0:14:39.200
This is what we call signs and wonders.

0:14:39.200,0:14:46.700
It is not an issue of headache going but you can see the needles brought out

0:14:46.700,0:14:49.300
and you can see thousand needles inside.

0:14:49.300,0:14:51.260
Signs and wonders.

0:14:51.260,0:14:56.040
The same way Moses said to the Red Sea.

0:14:56.040,0:14:57.860
Thank You, Lord!

0:14:57.860,0:15:00.060
Thank You, Jesus, for saving my life!

0:15:00.060,0:15:14.300
We are talking of the command Elijah used when the little children were calling him "bald head man"

0:15:14.300,0:15:20.960
and he commanded the bear to come out and eat them.

0:15:20.960,0:15:24.360
They could not even find the bones and blood on the floor.

0:15:24.360,0:15:27.280
We call it a command.

0:15:27.280,0:15:33.500
It is not an issue of, "In the name of Jesus, go. In the name of Jesus, I rebuke, I bind".

0:15:33.500,0:15:39.760
If that is what Daniel used in the lion den, the lion would have removed one hand

0:15:39.760,0:15:42.380
before Jesus comes to the rescue.

0:15:42.380,0:15:45.840
The way you offer prayer today, "In Jesus' name, I rebuke.

0:15:45.840,0:15:47.540
In Jesus' name, I bind".

0:15:47.540,0:15:50.940
The lion will not hear that; the lion will not wait for that.

0:15:50.940,0:15:57.560
Half of the body would have been gone before Jesus came to the rescue.

0:15:57.560,0:16:07.060
Three men, Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego, at the furnace.

0:16:07.060,0:16:10.540
A fire that nothing can be compared with.

0:16:10.540,0:16:11.960
They were dropped inside.

0:16:11.960,0:16:18.340
Even before they landed, if they had prayed like, "In the name of Jesus, I rebuke, I stop the fire",

0:16:18.340,0:16:21.840
I think the fire would have consumed them before that time.

0:16:21.840,0:16:24.060
Try to understand the command.

0:16:24.060,0:16:27.580
There is command and there is a command.

0:16:27.580,0:16:31.820
Ms Rebecca Idi, set free by a command in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:16:31.820,0:16:34.800
goes to a nearby restroom to check her body.

0:16:40.560,0:16:43.060
God, thank You so much for healing me.

0:16:43.060,0:16:44.400
I am free.

0:16:44.400,0:16:45.920
Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:45.920,0:16:48.680
Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!

0:16:48.680,0:16:50.440
Praise the living God!

0:16:50.440,0:16:53.420
I cannot feel the needle pricks anymore.

0:16:53.420,0:16:55.960
Thank You, Jesus, for sаving my life.

0:16:55.960,0:16:58.100
I don't feel the needle pricks anymore.

0:16:58.100,0:16:59.600
They have disappeared!

0:16:59.600,0:17:01.080
I thank God so much.

0:17:01.080,0:17:05.740
Ms Rebecca Idi testifies that she can no longer feel the sharp pain

0:17:05.740,0:17:08.400
caused by the needles in her body.

0:17:08.400,0:17:09.480
Thank You, Lord, I am free!

0:17:09.480,0:17:13.400
I don't feel the needle pricks anymore.

0:17:13.400,0:17:15.740
Thank You, Jesus!

0:17:15.740,0:17:16.340
Come on.

0:17:16.340,0:17:17.780
Have you checked yourself?

0:17:17.780,0:17:19.720
Are you free?

0:17:19.720,0:17:22.020
Before when I would touch my tummy, I would feel the needle pricks.

0:17:22.020,0:17:24.040
I don't feel them anymore.

0:17:24.040,0:17:27.200
Let me tell you something that happened at the healing section.

0:17:27.200,0:17:30.640
I never knew when that would happen.

0:17:30.640,0:17:33.960
I was thinking that it would be today.

0:17:33.960,0:17:38.540
When I stood here and she was talking, I saw it and I was looking at it

0:17:38.540,0:17:40.080
but I never heard anything.

0:17:40.080,0:17:41.960
How would this thing be done?

0:17:41.960,0:17:46.000
I knew that with God all things are possible and I was looking at it.

0:17:46.000,0:17:50.440
But I never knew that the whole thing would happen that day.

0:17:50.440,0:17:58.460
So, when I was moving round at the prayer line, I didn't see any green light -

0:17:58.460,0:18:01.100
an indication that I should pray for her.

0:18:01.100,0:18:04.740
I was praying for everyone; I was just moving.

0:18:04.740,0:18:16.040
Before I got to her, Prophet T.B. Joshua had got there already.

0:18:16.040,0:18:17.840
This is the lady here.

0:18:17.840,0:18:23.100
Stand up!

0:18:23.100,0:18:25.200
Stand close to your seat there!

0:18:25.200,0:18:33.540
When I was with this man, the resurrection power had already got to the lady.

0:18:33.540,0:18:36.700
The footprint of God.

0:18:36.700,0:18:47.580
Do you know what I mean with the footprint of God?

0:18:47.580,0:18:52.020
It moves with our shadow.

0:18:52.020,0:18:56.740
When we move, it is mostly on our shadow.

0:18:56.740,0:18:58.380
Look at you - I am on you.

0:18:58.380,0:19:00.200
Can you see the shadow?

0:19:00.200,0:19:02.560
See the shadow.

0:19:02.560,0:19:08.960
Can you see the shadow?

0:19:08.960,0:19:14.280
That is shadow.

0:19:14.280,0:19:16.240
That is the shadow.

0:19:16.240,0:19:21.480
The shadow overwhelmed him.

0:19:21.480,0:19:27.840
That shadow that overwhelmed him is full of lightning.

0:19:27.840,0:19:29.420
It is not thunder.

0:19:29.420,0:19:30.640
It is more than thunder.

0:19:30.640,0:19:33.180
Thunder is an agent of God.

0:19:33.180,0:19:41.060
But when I say "lightning", I mean the resurrection power that can go beyond the wall.

0:19:41.060,0:19:44.820
When it lights through the wall, it comes out at the other side.

0:19:44.820,0:19:47.600
But thunder - no.

0:19:47.600,0:19:49.500
Can you see that it has still captured him.

0:19:49.500,0:19:50.900
He could not move.

0:19:50.900,0:19:52.180
The resurrection power.

0:19:52.180,0:19:54.760
The same resurrection power can put him on the floor.

0:19:54.760,0:19:56.200
Look at him.

0:19:56.200,0:20:08.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:08.740,0:20:09.880
That's it.

0:20:09.880,0:20:14.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:14.080,0:20:17.020
That is it.

0:20:17.020,0:20:21.780
That is the resurrection power - how powerful!

0:20:21.780,0:20:26.820
It can move.

0:20:26.820,0:20:27.940
How powerful.

0:20:27.940,0:20:33.640
And not only him; He can bring all of them together and make them fall.

0:20:33.640,0:20:41.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:41.260,0:20:42.820
You may be seated.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:45.960,0:20:57.240
When I was moving and the sister was there, before getting to the sister,

0:20:57.240,0:21:02.260
the Lord was telling me, "Don't be afraid. Go there", because I had already seen a sign.

0:21:02.260,0:21:08.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:08.440,0:21:14.000
When I realised the presence of God was there before me,

0:21:14.000,0:21:18.300
I just had to grab the shoulder.

0:21:18.300,0:21:28.240
When I grabbed the shoulder, all the needles were right in my hand.

0:21:28.240,0:21:32.920
Right in my hand and it was needles I threw, not the lady.

0:21:32.920,0:21:35.880
The needles had made her become heavy.

0:21:35.880,0:21:40.140
When I pulled out the needles and they were in my hand, I just threw them away.

0:21:40.140,0:21:43.840
Because she was very light, she fell.

0:21:43.840,0:21:50.140
It was not her that was supposed to fall.

0:21:50.140,0:21:52.160
Let's see the sister.

0:21:52.160,0:21:55.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:55.760,0:21:57.100
Can you see the lady?

0:21:57.100,0:22:07.460
Can you put the former face to this face - needle face to God's face.

0:22:07.460,0:22:10.040
Let's hear from her.

0:22:10.040,0:22:16.820
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:22:16.820,0:22:19.860
My name is Ms Rebecca; I'm from Ghana.

0:22:19.860,0:22:27.260
Beside me are my dad, my mum, my elder brothers, my kid-sister and my kid-brother

0:22:27.260,0:22:30.020
and my auntie who helped me to come here.

0:22:30.020,0:22:35.840
In fact, you can look at me and compare me to my former appearance.

0:22:35.840,0:22:40.960
I was here last week Sunday.

0:22:40.960,0:22:44.100
I had needles in my body.

0:22:44.100,0:22:53.320
I had gone to so many places - so many doctors, herbal healers - but to no avail.

0:22:53.320,0:22:56.060
I was always in pain.

0:22:56.060,0:22:59.020
I was not schooling or doing anything.

0:22:59.020,0:23:03.140
I couldn't eat, walk or sleep.

0:23:03.140,0:23:09.020
A lady introduced me to The SCOAN.

0:23:09.020,0:23:11.980
She brought me here, last week.

0:23:11.980,0:23:17.780
I was placed on the prayer line, where the man of God prayed for me.

0:23:17.780,0:23:23.320
After he prayed for me, I examined myself very well.

0:23:23.320,0:23:27.860
I could not feel any pricks in my tummy.

0:23:27.860,0:23:37.960
I could eat, do everything, walk well, and sleep like a baby - no more pain.

0:23:37.960,0:23:42.200
I am so grateful to God for saving my life.

0:23:42.200,0:23:45.520
Rebecca
(Prayer Line Testimony)

0:23:45.520,0:23:51.020
After the prayer, I kept on asking myself each day,

0:23:51.020,0:23:54.620
"Where are the pins God removed from me?

0:23:54.620,0:23:57.240
They are nowhere to be found".

0:23:57.240,0:23:59.300
I thank God for saving me.

0:23:59.300,0:24:04.660
Now, I don't feel any pain anymore, anywhere.

0:24:04.660,0:24:06.460
I can do anything.

0:24:06.460,0:24:11.680
So, I thank God for what He has done for me, in Jesus' name.

0:24:11.680,0:24:15.740
Rebecca
(Prayer Line Testimony)

0:24:15.740,0:24:21.020
Little girl, now you keep wondering where the pins are?

0:24:21.020,0:24:23.440
Yes, I always wonder how.

0:24:23.440,0:24:25.820
I don't know where they are.

0:24:25.820,0:24:28.720
I am so excited.

0:24:28.720,0:24:33.560
After the prayer, you went to press those places where you felt the pain.

0:24:33.560,0:24:35.440
You knew the pain was there.

0:24:35.440,0:24:37.140
You could not feel those needles there again?

0:24:37.140,0:24:38.240
Not at all.

0:24:38.240,0:24:40.980
After the prayer, I examined myself.

0:24:40.980,0:24:43.680
I pressed my tummy.

0:24:43.680,0:24:49.300
I didn't feel the pricking that I used to feel whenever I pressed my tummy.

0:24:49.300,0:24:52.620
Your urine is clear now? There is nothing like blood?

0:24:52.620,0:24:53.980
Yes, everything is okay.

0:24:53.980,0:24:56.100
I am okay; I am alright - nothing.

0:24:56.100,0:25:00.940
Rebecca
(Prayer Line Testimony)

0:25:00.940,0:25:04.740
And you sleep very well now - no nightmares?

0:25:04.740,0:25:09.700
I now sleep like a newborn baby; I am okay!

0:25:09.700,0:25:12.800
I don't have sleepless nights anymore.

0:25:12.800,0:25:18.460
In the past, before you were prayed for, what were you experiencing every night?

0:25:18.460,0:25:23.820
In my dreams, I would see someone giving me food to eat.

0:25:23.820,0:25:28.060
But now, I don't have those kind of dreams anymore -

0:25:28.060,0:25:32.480
someone chasing me to kill me - I don't have them anymore.

0:25:32.480,0:25:35.000
Do you know the power you are under?

0:25:35.000,0:25:38.800
Sing this song along with me - Majesty.

0:25:38.800,0:25:42.580
Majesty

0:25:42.580,0:25:47.660
Worship His majesty

0:25:47.660,0:25:50.780
Unto Jesus

0:25:50.780,0:25:59.400
Be all glory, honour and praise

0:25:59.400,0:26:03.160
Majesty

0:26:03.160,0:26:08.500
Kingdom authority

0:26:08.500,0:26:13.660
Flows from His throne unto His own

0:26:13.660,0:26:19.120
His anthem raise

0:26:19.120,0:26:21.480
So exalt

0:26:21.480,0:26:23.560
Lift up on high

0:26:23.560,0:26:28.880
The name of Jesus

0:26:28.880,0:26:31.500
Magnify

0:26:31.500,0:26:33.560
Come glorify

0:26:33.560,0:26:40.240
Christ Jesus the King

0:26:40.240,0:26:43.980
Majesty

0:26:43.980,0:26:49.080
Worship His majesty

0:26:49.080,0:26:51.660
Jesus who died

0:26:51.660,0:26:54.120
Now glorified

0:26:54.120,0:26:59.240
King of all kings

0:26:59.240,0:27:01.820
Jesus who died

0:27:01.820,0:27:04.120
Now glorified

0:27:04.120,0:27:11.220
King of all kings

0:27:11.220,0:27:14.340
You may be seated; thank you.

0:27:14.340,0:27:18.220
Take your Bible and read the Book of John 3.

0:27:18.220,0:27:20.740
Start reading from verse 32.

0:27:20.740,0:27:29.600
The Book of John 3:32, "He testifies to what he has seen and heard".

0:27:29.600,0:27:34.820
He testifies to what he has seen and heard.

0:27:34.820,0:27:38.000
John 3:32, "but no one accepts his testimony".

0:27:38.000,0:27:41.600
No one accepts his testimony.

0:27:41.600,0:27:50.200
John 3:33, "The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful".

0:27:50.200,0:27:51.580
That is all.

0:27:51.580,0:27:57.760
The one who accepts this testimony among you will say God is truthful.

0:27:57.760,0:28:03.800
John 3:34, "For the one whom God has sent, speaks the Word of God".

0:28:03.800,0:28:10.340
The one that God has sent, speaks the Word of truth - the Word of God;

0:28:10.340,0:28:13.060
the Word of Spirit - the Word of God.

0:28:13.060,0:28:16.540
John 3:34, "for God gives me the Spirit without limit".

0:28:16.540,0:28:17.380
Have you listened to that?

0:28:17.380,0:28:27.060
The Father gave the Spirit to us to make us like His Son.

0:28:27.060,0:28:33.960
John 3:35, "The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in His hands.

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life".

0:28:38.060,0:28:41.140
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.

0:28:41.140,0:28:48.920
John 3:36, "but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him".

0:28:48.920,0:28:52.920
John 4:1, "The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptising

0:28:52.920,0:28:56.040
more disciples than John -

0:28:56.040,0:29:01.820
although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised, but his disciples".

0:29:01.820,0:29:08.560
John 4:3, "When the Lord learnt of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee".

0:29:08.560,0:29:11.540
John 4:4, "Now he had to go through Samaria.

0:29:11.540,0:29:15.000
John 4:5, "So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar,

0:29:15.000,0:29:20.080
near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph".

0:29:20.080,0:29:25.040
John 4:6, "Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey,

0:29:25.040,0:29:29.700
sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour".

0:29:29.700,0:29:35.140
John 4:7, "When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her,

0:29:35.140,0:29:37.440
'Will you give me a drink?'"

0:29:37.440,0:29:41.380
John 4:8, "(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)"

0:29:41.380,0:29:47.800
John 4:9, "The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman.

0:29:47.800,0:29:54.540
How can you ask me for a drink?' (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)"

0:29:54.540,0:29:59.060
John 4:10, "Jesus answered her, 'If you knew the gift of God

0:29:59.060,0:30:03.320
and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him

0:30:03.320,0:30:06.200
and he would have given you living water'."

0:30:06.200,0:30:07.280
Thank you.

0:30:07.280,0:30:09.040
Let's hear from the sister.

0:30:09.040,0:30:14.860
In fact, I was a 'ghost' talking to you last week Sunday.

0:30:14.860,0:30:17.940
But I can tell you that I am a human being now.

0:30:17.940,0:30:19.600
All glory to God.

0:30:19.600,0:30:24.720
I thank Him so much for giving me a second chance to live.

Rebecca
(Prayer Line Testimony)

0:30:28.660,0:30:31.360
What is your message to the youth?

0:30:31.360,0:30:38.260
All I can tell the youth is that they should put their hope in God

0:30:38.260,0:30:44.060
because He is the only one who can save them.

0:30:44.060,0:30:46.880
So, they should trust and believe in God.

0:30:46.880,0:30:52.400
You said you have been to many places and we know that you have spent a fortune.

0:30:52.400,0:30:53.740
Isn't it?

0:30:53.740,0:30:58.060
A lot of money but I now know God.

0:30:58.060,0:30:59.720
I know that God is here.

0:30:59.720,0:31:05.180
How much have you spent for God to give you so much to restore your life?

0:31:05.180,0:31:08.660
Nothing - not a dime.

0:31:08.660,0:31:10.340
Rebecca
(Prayer Line Testimony)

0:31:10.340,0:31:12.940
Thank you.

0:31:12.940,0:31:16.240
Let me thank the sister that brought this sister here.

0:31:16.240,0:31:21.420
She spent her money, preached the Gospel, told her that God is the Healer.

0:31:21.420,0:31:24.220
I think that God is the rewarder.

0:31:24.220,0:31:27.280
Let us just hear a word - what inspired you.

0:31:27.280,0:31:29.720
My name is Ms Julia Kujah.

0:31:29.720,0:31:33.240
I am the one who brought Rebecca here last week.

0:31:33.240,0:31:37.540
My joy knows no bounds.

0:31:37.540,0:31:41.780
It was not easy taking on such a challenge

0:31:41.780,0:31:45.380
when everyone else was giving up.

0:31:45.380,0:31:52.620
But I needed to amass faith because from the onset, we didn't have it easy.

0:31:52.620,0:31:57.560
Trying to get her a passport, aside from the usual ups and downs,

0:31:57.560,0:32:01.280
the day they asked her to come and collect her passport,

0:32:01.280,0:32:06.340
every passport that was printed came out but her own one came out blank.

0:32:06.340,0:32:10.220
So I said, "Wow, God, what a challenge!"

0:32:10.220,0:32:12.720
But I didn't give up.

0:32:12.720,0:32:17.580
Then, the day we were supposed to come, I called her and talked to her.

0:32:17.580,0:32:21.060
Then, that evening, I ended up in hospital.

0:32:21.060,0:32:25.160
I was admitted; the following day, my son was admitted; we cancelled it.

0:32:25.160,0:32:27.640
So, it wasn't an easy thing.

0:32:27.640,0:32:32.700
But I thank God that the more the challenges, the more resolved I was.

0:32:32.720,0:32:36.440
I brought her here with all the faith I had.

0:32:36.440,0:32:38.160
God did not disappoint me.

0:32:38.160,0:32:41.960
Indeed, God has done it for her; she is free.

0:32:41.960,0:32:46.640
I have talked to her and seen that her confidence has increased.

0:32:46.640,0:32:51.040
She is smiling, she can walk straight, she is sleeping.

0:32:51.040,0:32:53.260
I've talked to her and asked her if she feels any pain.

0:32:53.260,0:32:54.600
She replied, "No pain at all".

0:32:54.600,0:32:56.420
She is healed and hearty.

0:32:56.420,0:32:59.760
What else can I say but 'Thank You, Jesus'?

0:32:59.760,0:33:04.000
Indeed, our faith in Jesus is never in vain.

0:33:04.000,0:33:08.560
Those who put their trust in God will never be put to shame.

0:33:08.560,0:33:13.200
Rebecca is a testimony, and I want the whole world to know

0:33:13.200,0:33:15.600
that they should put their trust in God.

0:33:15.600,0:33:18.660
God will never fail you.

0:33:18.660,0:33:22.280
If men fail you, turn their backs and give up,

0:33:22.280,0:33:26.140
know that God is alive and He will do it.

0:33:26.140,0:33:27.720
Emmanuel!

I want to give you faith bracelets -

0:33:35.160,0:33:38.400
that is just my promise to give to the sister and you.

0:33:38.400,0:33:43.720
When you go back to your country, you will go with a shining light.

0:33:50.580,0:33:52.880
I work with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital.

0:33:52.880,0:33:56.160
I am a specialist with the Department of Anaesthesia.

0:33:56.160,0:33:59.640
After she came from the Prayer Line, I examined her abdomen

0:33:59.640,0:34:05.180
and I found multiple scars on her abdomen which were medical scars.

0:34:05.180,0:34:09.120
She didn't have any pain when I palpated her abdomen.

0:34:09.120,0:34:12.760
She reported that she had had pain prior to that.

0:34:12.760,0:34:16.280
It is the first time that I am giving people publicly.
