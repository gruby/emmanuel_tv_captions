God’s general CS UPTHEGROVE

For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil - 1 John 3:8

0:00:15.720,0:00:22.620
It is a good fight – a good warfare – the cause is good and the victory is sure,

0:00:22.620,0:00:27.180
if we continue, faithful and courageous.

0:00:37.300,0:00:49.660
healing, faith clinic is none other than Reverend C.S. Upthegrove from West Palm Beach, Florida.

0:00:49.660,0:00:54.660
Come on, let's give him a good hand.

0:00:54.660,0:00:59.280
This is the man whom God has sent.

0:00:59.280,0:01:01.300
Thank you, brother Allen.

0:01:01.300,0:01:06.780
Welcome to the Miracle Valley International Revival Centre.

0:01:06.780,0:01:11.440
I believe that God, today, is going to do a new thing.

0:01:11.440,0:01:20.420
God’s General C.S. Upthegrove

0:01:20.420,0:01:24.920
C.S. Upthegrove fought this good fight.

0:01:24.920,0:01:28.920
He fought it out and finished his course.

0:01:28.920,0:01:36.620
He did not give over till he was made more than a conqueror through God who loved him.

0:01:36.620,0:01:43.200
Evangelist C.S Upthegrove ranked among God's generals, ministered in the healing power of God

0:01:43.200,0:01:49.460
and preached the hope of the gospel of Jesus Christ to many in the US and around the world.

0:01:49.460,0:01:55.500
He began preaching the Word of God at the age of 15, and began seeing signs and wonders

0:01:55.500,0:02:01.820
in his revival meetings, where the sick were healed, the demon possessed were delivered

0:02:01.820,0:02:03.780
and the lost were saved.

0:02:03.780,0:02:13.660
In 1965, as a disciple of God's general A.A. Allen, he was ordained pastor of Miracle Valley in Arizona USA,

0:02:13.660,0:02:20.840
and people began coming from far and wide to receive their salvation, healing and deliverance.

0:02:20.840,0:02:28.300
This ministry continued until evangelist C.S. Upthegrove's peaceful passing.

0:02:28.300,0:02:36.180
In the late hours of Sunday, January 28th, 2018, the crown of life was placed upon his head.

0:02:36.180,0:02:43.180
Family and loved ones surrounded him, grateful to have had him in their midst.

0:02:43.180,0:02:49.380
Death to a good man is his release from the imprisonment of this world and his departure

0:02:49.380,0:02:52.080
to the enjoyments of another world.

0:02:52.080,0:02:58.840
He does not cease to be but is only removed from one world to another.

0:02:58.840,0:03:04.240
His legacy continues.

0:03:04.240,0:03:10.360
The best prayer we can offer our friends, family and loved ones is that the Lord Jesus Christ

0:03:10.360,0:03:19.760
may be with their spirits, to satisfy and save them and at the last, to receive them to Himself.

0:03:19.760,0:03:27.960
Many who believed as the God's generals did, are now before the throne, giving glory to the Lord.

0:03:27.960,0:03:31.480
May we be followers of them.

0:03:31.480,0:03:36.540
Goodbye, world!
From God’s General C.S. Upthegrove – 90 years

0:03:36.540,0:03:45.480
What a great comfort to a dying saint when he can look back upon his past life and say with Apostle Paul

0:03:45.480,0:03:56.100
in 2 Timothy 4:7, "I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, the doctrine of faith,

0:03:56.100,0:04:00.820
and the grace of faith.

0:04:00.820,0:04:06.760
Towards the end of our days, to be able to speak in this manner, what comfort -

0:04:06.760,0:04:10.980
unspeakable  comfort - would it afford!

0:04:10.980,0:04:18.680
During the visit of God’s general C.S. Upthegrove to The SCOAN, he spent his quality time

0:04:18.680,0:04:26.240
with Prophet T.B. Joshua, prophesying about things to come and even his own death.

0:04:26.240,0:04:34.200
Now, let’s listen to God’s general C.S. Upthegrove prophesying concerning his passing unto glory.

0:04:34.200,0:04:37.720
Goodbye, oh world.
Goodbye.

God’s General C.S. Upthegrove

0:04:45.520,0:04:54.980
Well I told all my troubles goodbye
Goodbye to each tear and each sigh

0:04:54.980,0:05:03.080
This world where I roam cannot be my home
I'm bound for that land in the sky

0:05:03.080,0:05:12.060
Well I walk and I talk with my Lord
I feast everyday on His Word

0:05:12.060,0:05:20.820
Well Heaven is near and I can't stay here
So goodbye world goodbye

0:05:20.820,0:05:31.840
Goodbye, world!
Goodbye!

0:05:31.840,0:05:38.620
It takes faith to maintain your position to the end.

0:05:38.620,0:05:44.540
The beauty of our achievement is when we no longer live but that achievement is still there,

0:05:44.540,0:05:52.680
linger on in the eyes and ears of the children yet unborn. – T.B. Joshua

0:05:52.680,0:06:04.460
Goodbye, world! 
Goodbye!
