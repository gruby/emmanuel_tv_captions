0:00:00.040,0:00:06.120
Viewers, I know that you are here.

0:00:06.120,0:00:09.800
But you still want me to look at you, you alone.

0:00:09.800,0:00:12.780
I'm talking to you, listen to me.

0:00:12.780,0:00:14.855
Carry Heaven along.

0:00:14.860,0:00:18.180
Wherever you are, Heaven knows that you are there.

0:00:18.180,0:00:19.200
Heaven.

0:00:19.200,0:00:27.400
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come, thy will be done.

0:00:27.400,0:00:31.660
When you carry Heaven along, you do the will of the Father.

0:00:31.660,0:00:40.280
I pray for enablement, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:40.280,0:00:44.060
Jesus knows what you are talking about.

0:00:44.060,0:00:46.920
You are talking about your weakness.

0:00:46.920,0:00:49.560
You are talking about your challenges.

0:00:49.560,0:00:51.800
You are talking about your situation.

0:00:51.800,0:00:58.740
Jesus knows what you are talking about.

0:00:58.740,0:01:03.220
That challenge does not mean that you are not a Christian.

0:01:03.220,0:01:08.260
That you have challenges does not mean that you are not a Christian.

0:01:08.260,0:01:12.620
Don't measure your Christian life by your challenges.

0:01:12.620,0:01:14.380
This is the situation with you.

0:01:14.380,0:01:18.640
Your heart, your spirit testifies
that you are a Christian.

0:01:18.640,0:01:26.220
The challenges you have are meant to promote you.

0:01:26.220,0:01:31.360
The challenges that you have 
are meant for your spiritual benefit.

0:01:31.360,0:01:35.420
Receive in the name of Jesus!

0:01:35.420,0:01:42.100
Through that challenge, I can see the next promotion.

0:01:42.100,0:01:45.760
Pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.

0:01:45.760,0:01:49.700
Desire to serve God!

0:01:49.700,0:01:53.460
Determination to serve God!

0:01:53.460,0:01:58.560
I can see you grow, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:58.560,0:02:02.840
Your challenge is meant to grow you, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:02.840,0:02:06.620
Don't listent to the voice of challenges.

0:02:06.620,0:02:08.320
Listen to God.

0:02:08.320,0:02:12.540
Challenges are meant to grow you in your Christian journey.

0:02:12.540,0:02:15.040
Look at what happened to Job.

0:02:15.040,0:02:22.620
Satan said to God, "Leave this man for me.
Let me give him challenges and situations".

0:02:22.620,0:02:26.840
The voice of challenges is to tell you,
"No, Jesus does not love me.

0:02:26.840,0:02:29.960
Jesus does not love me. I'm not faithful".

0:02:29.960,0:02:32.700
But no, listen to me!

0:02:32.700,0:02:36.200
I can see you growing, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:36.200,0:02:41.340
I can see you growing in your business!

0:02:41.340,0:02:45.000
That sickness be cursed, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:45.000,0:02:50.040
Wherever it is located in your system,
in your body, in your fluids, in your blood -

0:02:50.040,0:02:57.100
be cursed, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:57.100,0:03:04.000
Every spirit that torments your life,
every spirit that causes you sickness and disease,

0:03:04.000,0:03:07.400
every spirit that causes you disappointment,

0:03:07.400,0:03:10.520
every spirit that causes you                  nightmares,

0:03:10.520,0:03:14.080
be cursed, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:14.080,0:03:16.540
Heaven knows that you are there.

0:03:16.540,0:03:20.480
Confess this and begin to rebuke those spirits!

0:03:20.480,0:03:25.860
Curse them, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:25.860,0:03:27.780
Heaven knows you are here!

0:03:27.780,0:03:29.780
Thank You, Jesus!
