0:00:00.000,0:00:02.140
Please, man of God, help me!

0:00:02.140,0:00:04.240
Without this injection, I cannot walk.

0:00:04.240,0:00:06.140
I am tired of tablets and injections.

0:00:06.140,0:00:08.000
Please, help me, man of God!

0:00:08.000,0:00:11.320
Please, I have had operations nine times; next month will be the tenth time.

0:00:11.320,0:00:12.440
Please, I am tired.

0:00:12.440,0:00:15.680
This is what is in my leg.

0:00:15.680,0:00:17.500
Please, man of God, help me!

0:00:17.500,0:00:21.540
After a few years, they will take it out; they have to fix it in the other leg.

0:00:21.540,0:00:22.760
Please, man of God, help me!

0:00:22.760,0:00:24.260
This is what is in my leg.

0:00:24.260,0:00:26.380
This is the injection I take before I can walk.

0:00:26.380,0:00:28.480
These are the tablets I am taking every day.

0:00:28.480,0:00:31.080
I have had operations nine times.

0:00:31.080,0:00:32.820
Man of God, help me, please!

0:00:32.820,0:00:34.620
Next month, I am booked for an operation.

0:00:34.620,0:00:36.060
Please, help me!

0:00:36.060,0:00:39.940

A divine utterance from Heaven is given and a divine operation has taken place.

0:01:06.860,0:01:08.900
Walk gently!

0:01:08.900,0:01:10.020

Mrs Joy Gersak is delivered and healed.

0:01:23.240,0:01:34.360
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:34.360,0:01:39.800
Right now, the very lady in question is here in our midst to share her wonderful testimony.

0:01:39.800,0:01:43.080
We can already see the transformation; it is so clear.

0:01:43.080,0:01:46.700
We want to hear from her right now, to the glory of God.

0:01:46.700,0:01:48.840
Madam, you are very welcome, in Jesus' name.

0:01:48.840,0:01:52.920
Can you please introduce yourself to us and the lady beside you?

0:01:52.920,0:01:57.940
Emmanuel!
(God Is With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:57.940,0:02:01.220
My name is Joy Gersak.
I am from Austria.

0:02:01.220,0:02:02.780
I thank God.

0:02:02.780,0:02:07.020
Everybody should help me to thank God for bringing me back to life.

0:02:07.020,0:02:08.700
I was really suffering.

0:02:08.700,0:02:12.960
I was passing through pain from one operation to another.

0:02:12.960,0:02:18.140
Every day – tablets, doctors and from one doctor to another.

0:02:18.140,0:02:24.900
They said that it was sports – because of sports was why I had the pain.

0:02:24.900,0:02:29.920
I woke up one day and saw my leg was swollen.

0:02:29.920,0:02:31.760
They had to rush me to hospital.

0:02:31.760,0:02:34.100
On getting there, they said it was this and that.

0:02:34.100,0:02:36.700
They didn't really know what was happening to me.

0:02:36.700,0:02:40.020
They were saying that it was knee arthritis or pus.

0:02:40.020,0:02:41.980
I went from one doctor to another.

0:02:41.980,0:02:44.800
I took more than 13 tablets every day.

0:02:44.800,0:02:49.940
I was confused until the last operation, the ninth operation.

0:02:49.940,0:02:54.680
The ninth one is where they fixed in iron; everybody can still see it.

0:02:54.680,0:02:57.080
This is it.

0:02:57.080,0:03:02.140
This is the tenth one; they said they wanted to fix in more iron.

0:03:02.140,0:03:09.960
This is where they were draining water from.

0:03:09.960,0:03:14.080
It was my sister from Canada; God bless her.

0:03:14.080,0:03:16.760
She is the one who paid for my ticket to come to this place.

0:03:16.760,0:03:17.980
When I arrived here...

0:03:17.980,0:03:19.880
OK, before you go ahead madam...

0:03:19.880,0:03:25.040
We can see our sister is so overwhelmed by the wonderful testimony she has to share.

0:03:25.040,0:03:32.080
We just want you to explain clearly; for how long were you having this bilateral knee arthritis?

0:03:32.080,0:03:36.440
Explain to us; you've mentioned injections, tablets...

0:03:36.440,0:03:41.440
On a daily basis, what was the type of pain you were in because of this problem?

0:03:41.440,0:03:43.180
The pain was unbearable.

0:03:43.180,0:03:45.780
I cannot even remember and I don’t want to remember.

0:03:45.780,0:03:47.140
I cannot.

0:03:47.140,0:03:49.320
I could not eat or sleep.

0:03:49.320,0:03:51.660
I had to take tablets before I went to bed.

0:03:51.660,0:03:55.080
Before I would get out of bed, I would take tablets.

0:03:55.080,0:03:59.640
What were the things you were completely unable to do because of all of this?

0:03:59.640,0:04:03.680
I could not walk; I stopped working.

0:04:03.680,0:04:06.680
I could not do anything my mates were doing.

0:04:06.680,0:04:07.700
Not really.

0:04:07.700,0:04:09.160
Sometimes even to go to the toilet...

0:04:09.160,0:04:10.720
This is my senior daughter.

0:04:10.720,0:04:14.560
With the junior ones, she had to take me to the toilet and take me back.

0:04:14.560,0:04:16.000
Imagine!

0:04:16.000,0:04:20.720
I was really passing through pain.

0:04:20.720,0:04:24.720
You said you had passed through how many operations before you came here?

0:04:24.720,0:04:26.180
Nine operations.

0:04:26.180,0:04:31.100
Nine operations; to the extent that even metal was inserted into one of your knees?

0:04:31.100,0:04:32.400
Yes.

0:04:32.400,0:04:37.360
They had told you that they wanted to insert metal in your other knee, before you came here?

0:04:37.360,0:04:39.260
Yes, and they said that I didn’t have the right to decide.

0:04:39.260,0:04:41.020
They had to decide for me.

0:04:41.020,0:04:49.260
So, they decided and fixed the date on November 6th for me to submit all the results for my blood and everything.

0:04:49.260,0:04:51.660
I came here on the 3rd of November.

0:04:51.660,0:04:54.660
How did you find out about The SCOAN?

0:04:54.660,0:04:59.760
You were at the very critical stage now, they wanted to operate your other knee and insert iron...

0:04:59.760,0:05:01.260
How did you come to be here?

0:05:01.260,0:05:06.720
It was a friend; she is more than a sister to me and is based in Canada.

0:05:06.720,0:05:10.060
She is the one who sponsored my coming to this place.

0:05:10.060,0:05:11.300
We thank God Almighty.

0:05:11.300,0:05:12.860
When you came here...

0:05:12.860,0:05:17.620
We witnessed on the screen the events that happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.

0:05:17.620,0:05:22.560
Can you just describe to us exactly what happened, as the man of God began to pray?

0:05:22.560,0:05:25.340
As the man of God was praying for me, I passed out.

0:05:25.340,0:05:29.940
I cannot remember what was going on.

0:05:29.940,0:05:34.360
The only thing I heard was, "Get up and walk" and I started running.

0:05:34.360,0:05:36.680
That was the only thing I remember.

0:05:36.680,0:05:41.240
Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:41.240,0:05:46.260
When the man of God was praying, speaking in tongues, and your whole body was shaking and trembling;

0:05:46.260,0:05:47.860
you can't remember what happened?

0:05:47.860,0:05:50.280
Not at all.

0:05:50.280,0:05:54.900
The moment you heard the declaration, "Rise up and walk!", what happened?

0:05:54.900,0:05:59.880
I was free and was no longer feeling any pain.

0:05:59.880,0:06:05.900
I slept like a baby – no tablets and no injections.

0:06:05.900,0:06:11.460
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:11.460,0:06:14.600
There is a big change, very big.

0:06:14.600,0:06:19.520
Before, I could not walk or do what my mates were doing.

0:06:19.520,0:06:22.980
But after I returned, everything was OK.

0:06:22.980,0:06:24.760
I can do everything.

0:06:24.760,0:06:26.120
I also started working.

0:06:26.120,0:06:28.840
I work now, whereas before, I could not work.

0:06:28.840,0:06:32.900
I was on pension as a retiree.

0:06:32.900,0:06:36.480
When I went back to Austria, I went back to the doctor.

0:06:36.480,0:06:41.040
The doctor checked everything and said I was OK; so, I started working.

0:06:41.040,0:06:42.400
Now, I work.

0:06:42.400,0:06:46.020
Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:46.020,0:06:50.820
You had mentioned madam that the doctors had earlier booked you for an operation.

0:06:50.820,0:06:53.800
When you went back to your country - Austria, what happened?

0:06:53.800,0:07:01.920
When I went back to Austria, I went to meet my doctor and told him I wanted to have an x-ray done, which I did.

0:07:01.920,0:07:06.860
When the doctor checked, he asked me what I had done with my leg.

0:07:06.860,0:07:10.160
I said, "This is God" and he said, "God? What is God?"

0:07:10.160,0:07:13.580
I told him that I had travelled to Nigeria to a church for prayer.

0:07:13.580,0:07:17.420
He said there was no God but I said, "There is God".

0:07:17.420,0:07:21.420
He said he could not find anything in my leg to operate on so they could not operate on it.

0:07:21.420,0:07:26.960
Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:07:26.960,0:07:33.960
This is the hospital which had told our sister that they would have to insert iron in her other knee

0:07:33.960,0:07:41.080
because of the severity of the arthritis she was in, but the same hospital checked an x-ray and confirmed

0:07:41.080,0:07:42.180
there was no more problem.

0:07:42.180,0:07:44.300
She didn't have to go for an operation.

0:07:44.300,0:07:52.680
I have not been taking tablets, injections, therapy or seeing doctors.

0:07:52.680,0:07:54.740
Thank You, Jesus!

0:07:54.740,0:07:58.480
For the glory of God; we just like you to demonstrate how you can now walk freely,

0:07:58.480,0:08:04.760
after the prayer you received.

0:08:04.760,0:08:10.500
Wow, this is someone that had to take injections just to be able to move about in a slow way.

0:08:10.500,0:08:12.660
We can see what she is doing right now.

0:08:12.660,0:08:13.940
How are you feeling, madam?

0:08:13.940,0:08:20.360
I'm feeling very OK now; I think I may still go back to sports!

0:08:20.360,0:08:21.940
Wow, thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:08:21.940,0:08:26.700
Let's put our hands together one more time for our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:08:26.700,0:08:31.760
Madam, we can see medical reports on the board here, as well as an x-ray.

0:08:31.760,0:08:38.300
OK, this is a medical report, where the doctor says that everything is fine with my leg.

0:08:38.300,0:08:40.520
I do not need any operation.

0:08:40.520,0:08:42.820
It is written here in German.

0:08:42.820,0:08:44.900
We thank Jesus Christ.

0:08:44.900,0:08:50.480
The medical report is actually written in German language, but our sister is explaining that doctors

0:08:50.480,0:08:55.600
had confirmed that she no longer needed to go for an operation on her other knee, as she had been

0:08:55.600,0:08:58.280
completely healed, to the glory of God Almighty.

0:08:58.280,0:09:00.680
We can also see once again the x-ray here.

0:09:00.680,0:09:02.680
Can you just show this to us, madam?

0:09:02.680,0:09:09.880
This is the x-ray for me left knee before.

0:09:09.880,0:09:14.320
This is the x-ray of my right knee, where they wanted to operate.

0:09:14.320,0:09:15.580
Now, everything is OK.

0:09:15.580,0:09:19.980
This is from where they were removing water before.

0:09:19.980,0:09:21.920
Since then, they have stopped draining water.

0:09:21.920,0:09:27.440
Before, they would drain water three times a week.

0:09:27.440,0:09:29.440
I don't have pain anymore.

0:09:29.440,0:09:34.120
This is indeed a mighty miracle and we give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ;

0:09:34.120,0:09:40.860
one more time, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus for rescuing our sister

0:09:40.860,0:09:44.220
and completely setting her free - we thank our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:09:44.220,0:09:48.600
Madam, now, that you are here today, you are living, walking, talking miracle to the testimony

0:09:48.600,0:09:50.020
of our Lord Jesus Christ;

0:09:50.020,0:09:53.720
what is your advice to viewers around the world?

0:09:53.720,0:09:59.540
My advice to everyone who is watching me now is that

0:09:59.540,0:10:03.500
when you have problems, please, don't lose hope; run to God.

0:10:03.500,0:10:11.300
I went to many places and spent money but I came here and the man of God did not take anything from me.

0:10:11.300,0:10:14.040
As I was going back, I know what he gave me.

0:10:14.040,0:10:18.300
He gave me many things, including Morning Water.

0:10:18.300,0:10:20.160
Everybody should help me thank the man of God.

0:10:20.160,0:10:24.580
My advice is that if you have problems, run to God.

0:10:24.580,0:10:25.920
This is where I found my peace.

0:10:25.920,0:10:29.660
This is where I will be coming always, in Jesus' name.

0:10:29.660,0:10:32.080
Amen. Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:10:32.080,0:10:33.720
My name is Deborah.

0:10:33.720,0:10:35.300
This is my mother.

0:10:35.300,0:10:39.000
Before she came to the church, she was having so much pain.

0:10:39.000,0:10:46.560
My sister and I had to do the dishes; clean the house, do the laundry and help her through the day.

0:10:46.560,0:10:53.780
We were sad because we knew that she was in so much pain and we couldn't really help her.

0:10:53.780,0:10:57.780
It was just to do the dishes, laundry and housework, nothing else.

0:10:57.780,0:11:00.520
We couldn't take the pain away from her.

0:11:00.520,0:11:02.860
Your mother came to The SCOAN.

0:11:02.860,0:11:09.320
What were the changes, the transformation that you saw when she came back to Austria?

0:11:09.320,0:11:15.040
We saw that she could do the things that she couldn't do before.

0:11:15.040,0:11:20.700
She can walk long distances and do the shopping.

0:11:20.700,0:11:28.860
My sister and I can concentrate more on our studies and go out more often.

0:11:28.860,0:11:33.240
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.

0:11:33.240,0:11:39.200
My advice would be: everyone should believe; don't lose faith in God.

0:11:39.200,0:11:40.060
Thank You, Jesus.

0:11:40.060,0:11:42.640
We thank God Almighty for this wonderful miracle.

0:11:42.640,0:11:48.700
We pray that God would give both our sisters here the grace to continue maintaining

0:11:48.700,0:11:53.600
the wonderful thing they've received from Him and to make the Word of God a standard for their lives

0:11:53.600,0:11:59.240
and as they do so, we know, better is not good enough - the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:11:59.240,0:12:01.000
Amen.

0:12:01.000,0:12:07.060
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
