Changing Lives

0:00:08.980,0:00:13.920
Emmanuel, viewers. I am Annette.

0:00:13.920,0:00:16.320
And my name is Chris.

0:00:16.320,0:00:19.840
Welcome once again to the program Changing Lives,

0:00:19.840,0:00:23.100
where we will take a deeper look into the lives of people

0:00:23.100,0:00:28.380
who have been touched by God Almighty  through the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:00:28.380,0:00:32.700
Yes, indeed, we know that in life, experience is the best teacher.

0:00:32.700,0:00:39.300
And through these interviews, we gonna be guided in so many ways to learn some very valuable lessons of life,

0:00:39.300,0:00:43.980
to learn how people overcame their challenges, how they endured their pains,

0:00:43.980,0:00:49.520
and how at the end of the day they came out with a wonderful testimony to the glory of God.

0:00:49.520,0:00:54.500
Now, in today's program we shall be listening to Mrs Augustina Orakwe

0:00:54.500,0:01:02.420
and her husband Dr. Orakwe, a retired controller of prisons in the Nigerian Prison Services,

0:01:02.420,0:01:06.520
and doctor of Sociology.

0:01:06.520,0:01:11.240
Together they had some tough experiences in life, especially concerning some ups and downs

0:01:11.240,0:01:18.640
in their marital lives but through Christ they overcame even in the midst of that very difficult situation

0:01:18.640,0:01:20.860
through discovering  Emmanuel TV.

0:01:20.860,0:01:24.900
And today we are gonna take an opportunity to listen to their experiences.

0:01:24.900,0:01:30.940
We believe that through the testimony of this family, you will discover how marital bliss can be restored

0:01:30.940,0:01:36.620
and repaired, when we anchor our hope on the foundation of Christ.

0:01:36.620,0:01:42.340
Hallelujah! So you are all very welcome in Jesus' name to this program - Changing Lives.

0:01:42.340,0:01:45.040
It's a great privilege to have you with us today.

0:01:45.040,0:01:47.860
And we would like to start with our mother first.

0:01:47.860,0:01:50.780
If you would you can just introduce yourself to us and the people beside you,

0:01:50.780,0:01:54.820
and just share your testimony to our viewers to the glory of God.

0:01:54.820,0:01:59.100
My name is Mrs Augustina Orakwe.

0:01:59.100,0:02:08.480
The man beside me is my husband Dr. Orakwe. My left hand side man is my junior brother Chima Ozorumba,

0:02:08.480,0:02:12.500
and the wife Joy Ozorumba.

0:02:12.500,0:02:21.680
The problem that brought us to the SCOAN - we had problems in our marriage.

0:02:21.680,0:02:28.180
Years ago a voice came to me, telling me: "I will scatter your marriage."

0:02:28.180,0:02:36.500
But I didn't know how, but as a child of God I prayed and I forgot about it.

0:02:36.500,0:02:41.300
When my husband came back home that day, I told him that I heard a voice today

0:02:41.300,0:02:43.640
and what the voice said.

0:02:43.640,0:02:46.880
We also prayed and we left the whole thing like that.

0:02:46.880,0:02:51.180
But after I heard that voice, problems started in the marriage.

0:02:51.180,0:02:58.160
We started experiencing things we have not been experiencing before -

0:02:58.160,0:03:09.100
lack of trust in the marriage, so many challenges. Even this family idol had brought problems

0:03:09.100,0:03:13.680
not only in my marriage, but in the marriages of my siblings,

0:03:13.680,0:03:21.600
bringing people down. My eldest brother is a Russian trained petrol chemical engineer -

0:03:21.600,0:03:25.920
but nothing to show for it because of the family idol.

0:03:25.920,0:03:33.740
Because the family idol - on that day I received this deliverance - spoke that it had destroyed everybody.

0:03:33.740,0:03:36.260
And it's true.

0:03:36.260,0:03:42.620
Before we came to the SCOAN, like I earlier said, we experienced a lot of problems.

0:03:42.620,0:03:46.420
They themselves were experiencing several problems in their homes.

0:03:46.420,0:03:50.480
We never knew that it was the family idol.

0:03:50.480,0:03:54.580
So these problems continued on and on.

0:03:54.580,0:04:03.360
As a child of God, I went to so many places, praying, looking for solution but all to no avail,

0:04:03.360,0:04:14.260
until we came to the SCOAN because of watching of Emmanuel TV which my husband discovered.

0:04:14.260,0:04:24.400
So we started watching it. When we saw what God is doing in the SCOAN through Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:04:24.400,0:04:29.680
we now realized that our problems can be faced.

0:04:29.680,0:04:36.580
So that was how we came to the SCOAN and I thank God for His intervention.

0:04:36.580,0:04:49.700
When we came here that day, they ministered the New Morning Water on me

0:04:49.700,0:04:55.440
and the Holy Spirit took over and the family idol, spiritual husband started to speak.

0:04:55.440,0:04:57.980
Can you just describe what you experienced,

0:04:57.980,0:05:00.660
when that New Morning Water was ministered to you at that moment?

0:05:00.660,0:05:06.120
When the New Morning Water was ministered on me, I didn't know what happened.

0:05:06.120,0:05:15.860
I started talking... Even now, I am still thinking of how I got that word - "family idol".

0:05:15.860,0:05:21.760
The thing just came and started talking: "I have destroyed everybody, I have destroyed this, that marriages."

0:05:21.760,0:05:26.560
And it is true - no steady marriages in my family. Problems here and there.

0:05:26.560,0:05:32.620
We didn't know that it was the family idol that brought all these problems.

0:05:32.620,0:05:40.480
But thank God for Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua who submitted himself for God to use.

0:05:40.480,0:05:48.020
Because without him submitting for God to use him to deliver people, a lot of people would have gone.

0:05:48.020,0:05:51.580
But thank God for him.

0:05:51.580,0:05:56.960
So it was when we came here, that we got solution and I know, because of that deliverance on that day -

0:05:56.960,0:06:01.040
in fact, my siblings started getting testimonies.

0:06:01.040,0:06:08.120
And since that day, everything, my marriage is like we just started again.

0:06:08.120,0:06:09.740
Praise God.

0:06:09.740,0:06:19.520
Changing Lives

0:06:19.520,0:06:22.320
Praise God. It was wonderful.

0:06:22.320,0:06:25.860
And Doctor Arakwe, if we can hear from you, please.

0:06:25.860,0:06:31.620
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23). I am Dr. Ifediora Arakwe. I am retired Controller of Prisons

0:06:31.620,0:06:36.720
and I hold a doctorate degree in Sociology.

0:06:36.720,0:06:42.980
And I served the prison service in Nigeria for 34 years.

0:06:42.980,0:06:49.800
In the course of my career, especially in the last 16 years, I had the privilege of being engaged

0:06:49.800,0:06:54.640
in international correction activities that took me around the world.

0:06:54.640,0:06:58.120
Before now we didn't know about Emmanuel TV.

0:06:58.120,0:07:04.020
We never heard about it. The only thing we heard about Prophet T.B. Joshua was in 1996,

0:07:04.020,0:07:06.980
when some pastors made some caustic remarks about him.

0:07:06.980,0:07:12.000
And you know, like everything evil, it went into the memory and settled there.

0:07:12.000,0:07:14.160
But as I started travelling around the world...

0:07:14.160,0:07:19.200
I am very sorry, sir, can you explain to us, you say 'caustic remarks' - what do you mean?

0:07:19.200,0:07:26.640
In 1996, some pastors in Lagos here said that people should not listen to Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:07:26.640,0:07:31.720
In fact, it was printed in magazines that he was patronizing mummy water spirits and all that stuff.

0:07:31.720,0:07:35.060
When you say this type of thing, it easily settles in people's memory.

0:07:35.060,0:07:39.560
So nobody knew about Emmanuel TV; nobody knew about him.

0:07:39.560,0:07:48.220
That caustic remark in 1996 almost made us think no more of T.B. Joshua

0:07:48.220,0:07:49.600
and so it continued like that.

0:07:49.600,0:07:53.820
Even when this crisis came into my marriage, we were born again, we were believers,

0:07:53.820,0:08:01.760
we had a nearly perfect marriage but this issue that came up, this demonic attack in the family

0:08:01.760,0:08:03.760
almost tore the family to shreds.

0:08:03.760,0:08:07.880
I think that what was keeping us was our Christian confession.

0:08:07.880,0:08:12.020
So it continued and continued and continued and we were praying.

0:08:12.020,0:08:19.380
I must confess that even here in Lagos in the last six years, we were always coming for night vigil

0:08:19.380,0:08:24.860
every last Friday of January after 30 days fasting and praying.

0:08:24.860,0:08:32.060
And so I didn't know about Emmanuel TV. I didn't know about the SCOAN.

0:08:32.060,0:08:38.900
Like I said, I was involved in corrections, both internationally and locally and in Africa.

0:08:38.900,0:08:47.080
So it took me around the world but I started getting to hear about Emmanuel TV as far back as 2012,

0:08:47.080,0:08:51.720
when on one of our conferences in Uganda, a cabinet minister asked me -

0:08:51.720,0:08:56.460
because I was always dressed as a Nigerian, dressed in caftan, wearing the cap.

0:08:56.460,0:09:03.100
If the weather was sub zero cold, I would still wear it, then I would use winter jacket to cover up.

0:09:03.100,0:09:08.540
But I would always wear that Nigerian outfit. So the guy asked me: "Are you from Nigeria?" I said: "Yes."

0:09:08.540,0:09:13.720
The first person he asked me about was: "What about Prophet T.B. Joshua?"

0:09:13.720,0:09:16.220
I said: "Who is he?"

0:09:16.220,0:09:19.860
He said: "The man of God in Nigeria. Do you know him?" I said, I didn't know him.

0:09:19.860,0:09:25.540
So he said: "Your life must be miserable." 
- And he is government minister? 
- Yes.

0:09:25.540,0:09:29.060
So he said: "We have been to Nigeria. We had problems, we came to Lagos.

0:09:29.060,0:09:37.160
We came to Lagos and the man prayed and you are telling me you don't know about him."

0:09:37.160,0:09:42.340
I went to Barbados in 2009.

0:09:42.340,0:09:48.100
Somebody asked me: "How is Prophet T.B.Joshua?" I just waived him aside.

0:09:48.100,0:09:55.200
I went to Mexico, they said: "Senor, Prophet T.B. Joshua?"

0:09:55.200,0:09:59.780
I went to Singapore: "Nigerian! How is Prophet T.B. Joshua?"

0:09:59.780,0:10:05.520
Nobody was asking me about President Obasanjo or Goodluck Jonathan!

0:10:05.520,0:10:11.660
When I now had this experience in Uganda and the man's comment was like a rebuke,

0:10:11.660,0:10:20.460
I went back to my hotel room and turned on television and started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:10:20.460,0:10:28.620
In 2014 in South Africa, I addressed a conference of African Ministers of Interior.

0:10:28.620,0:10:34.120
One day, one from Zambia, when he was giving me a promise that he would invite me to Zambia

0:10:34.120,0:10:41.760
to come and look at the prisons, and see the changes, he now told me: "What about Prophet T.B. Joshua?"

0:10:41.760,0:10:43.140
So I came back and I told her, I said...

0:10:43.140,0:10:49.520
When I went to the hotel, I tuned the televison station straight to Emmanuel TV and started watching.

0:10:49.520,0:10:52.120
I couldn't sleep.

0:10:52.120,0:11:01.080
Changing Lives

0:11:01.080,0:11:07.080
Can I just ask you - what first went through your heart, when you first switched on the TV and watched Emmanuel TV ?

0:11:07.080,0:11:11.360
Well, I wanted to find out what the world was telling me about.

0:11:11.360,0:11:14.520
And it was happening in my own country, and I was ignorant of it.

0:11:14.520,0:11:18.080
It made me look very illiterate. It made me look very unschooled.

0:11:18.080,0:11:22.660
It made me look very foolish that ministers of cabinet level, will be telling me about

0:11:22.660,0:11:29.180
Prophet T.B. Joshua in my own country and I was kind of saying - I don't know.

0:11:29.180,0:11:32.660
As a Sociologist at that level, I should know.

0:11:32.660,0:11:38.120
So when I came back, I started watching. I said: "Madam, something is happening and we are missing it."

0:11:38.120,0:11:40.920
She said: "What?" I said: "Look at the television."

0:11:40.920,0:11:43.760
So we saw deliverances.

0:11:43.760,0:11:50.280
I want to confess - that was when my heart became very bitter.

0:11:50.280,0:11:56.640
That was when I became pained. And even I will ask the Prophet to pray for me,

0:11:56.640,0:11:58.900
so that that bitterness will go away.

0:11:58.900,0:12:02.620
Because I felt that some people were deliberately tarnishing the man's image

0:12:02.620,0:12:08.400
so as to prevent Nigerians from getting the best spiritually and physically from the deliverance here.

0:12:08.400,0:12:13.720
So I felt, I want God to forgive me. I really was angry.

0:12:13.720,0:12:18.060
So you would agree, sir, that what a danger in ignorance.

0:12:18.060,0:12:19.360
That is why it's happening.

0:12:19.360,0:12:24.840
I was telling you about my sister in law who is in Ejigbo here - just 100 Naira bus away.

0:12:24.840,0:12:30.840
I had to drag her to this place because when I said: "Your husband has been out of job for eleven years

0:12:30.840,0:12:33.540
and you were told that it was an affliction.

0:12:33.540,0:12:38.460
And you stay there but just to come here, you say - they told you the man is... Well, come here."

0:12:38.460,0:12:42.400
I am glad she came and got the first New Morning Water testimony on Sunday.

0:12:42.400,0:12:47.500
And I don't think anyone can put her away from Emmanuel TV, from the SCOAN.

0:12:47.500,0:12:48.600
So that's my pain.

0:12:48.600,0:12:54.100
But from that 2014, when we started watching it steadily, I came to the conclusion that

0:12:54.100,0:13:00.260
whatever it was - I had physical problems, my heart and hypertension - it was there.

0:13:00.260,0:13:04.240
When we came here in March, I got Morning Water and I was ok.

0:13:04.240,0:13:06.260
And I told her we were going to come again.

0:13:06.260,0:13:10.460
When we came in March, the man of God didn't have time to touch people.

0:13:10.460,0:13:13.220
We collected the Morning Water and left. We had our testimony.

0:13:13.220,0:13:16.920
But we still wanted to come back. We wanted one on one.

0:13:16.920,0:13:20.980
So when we came this time, we didn't see him, we were disappointed,

0:13:20.980,0:13:23.400
although the New Morning Water was ministered.

0:13:23.400,0:13:26.460
Maybe, because of the disappointment, the faith did not click.

0:13:26.460,0:13:30.260
Then, she suggested and I agreed that we stay another extra week.

0:13:30.260,0:13:35.240
Then we fasted and prayed for three days before that Sunday. The only prayer point there was:

0:13:35.240,0:13:39.560
"May we see this man of God; may we have an encounter with him."

0:13:39.560,0:13:43.140
When we came to the church that day, there was ministration of the Morning Water

0:13:43.140,0:13:46.600
but there was general church service.

0:13:46.600,0:13:52.920
Then I think an announcement was made that they were going to minister New Morning Water,

0:13:52.920,0:13:54.240
after that we can go.

0:13:54.240,0:14:01.700
I was a little depressed and I told her. I said: "Since we have got the Morning Water,

0:14:01.700,0:14:07.340
maybe after this Morning Water let's go back to Abuja. We have exhausted our resources, let's go back".

0:14:07.340,0:14:14.040
But little did I know that the Morning Water that was coming that day was the new one that had power and potency.

0:14:14.040,0:14:20.520
The moment it was ministered onto her, she went into skyline.

0:14:20.520,0:14:27.640
I knew deep inside me that what was happening to my wife was spiritual.

0:14:27.640,0:14:31.540
She would offend me and I would tell her what she did, and she would say she didn't do it.

0:14:31.540,0:14:38.300
From my experience on Emmanuel TV and the people that had been previously delivered

0:14:38.300,0:14:43.160
I knew that deep inside me that what was wrong, was spiritual.

0:14:43.160,0:14:46.680
It was only the Morning Water that brought the confirmation

0:14:46.680,0:14:52.160
and I want to tell you that after that Sunday we are husband and wife again.

0:14:52.160,0:14:55.560
It is just like when it was at the beginning.

0:14:55.560,0:14:56.600
Glory be to God.

0:14:56.600,0:15:00.300
And the pain is that we didn't come earlier. And that's why I spoke.

0:15:00.300,0:15:05.980
And I am going to use this opportunity to speak again to tell - not the foreigners.

0:15:05.980,0:15:10.760
Because when the man of God went to Mexico, he was received presidentially.

0:15:10.760,0:15:18.560
He went to Paraguay, Uruguay, Botswana, Ecuador, Singapore, look at Indonesia.

0:15:18.560,0:15:22.320
That is almost 90% Muslim. Look at South Korea.

0:15:22.320,0:15:30.000
Everywhere he is received but in this country where he is domiciled, he is not acknowledged.

0:15:30.000,0:15:33.180
He is not acknowledged. It is a terrible thing.

0:15:33.180,0:15:38.440
And I want to address pastors. They say they are Christians but do not acknowledge

0:15:38.440,0:15:42.900
that this man has the grace of God to deliver and to save.

0:15:42.900,0:15:45.720
They should allow that he is not asking for their congregation.

0:15:45.720,0:15:47.420
He is not asking for their members.

0:15:47.420,0:15:51.960
They should please tell their churches the truth, so that the people who are suffering under various

0:15:51.960,0:15:56.080
yokes can come here and be delivered, they should not lie.

0:15:56.080,0:16:00.680
So many people out there are under that yoke like I was being told: "Don't go to T.B. Joshua.

0:16:00.680,0:16:03.040
He is this, he is that".

0:16:03.040,0:16:09.140
T.B. Joshua is a genuine man of God whom God is using in this generation to do impossible.

0:16:09.140,0:16:13.740
To deliver people and to save them by the power in that name.

0:16:13.740,0:16:19.100
And anybody that is preventing you from coming here to seek deliverance from spiritual,

0:16:19.100,0:16:23.480
from physical, from every other yoke is not helping your business line.

0:16:23.480,0:16:26.360
That is the advice I want to give to Nigerians.

0:16:26.360,0:16:32.820
And I am using this medium to let them know that they are suffering because of ignorance.

0:16:32.820,0:16:36.180
The Bible says: "My people perish because of lack of knowledge."

0:16:36.180,0:16:43.680
I have come here and the yoke that held my family and my extended family hostage has been broken.

0:16:43.680,0:16:48.620
And if I had come here five years ago, I wouldn't have ended my career the way I did.

0:16:48.620,0:16:53.680
I served the prisons for 34 years, I was stagnated for nine years.

0:16:53.680,0:16:57.760
At the beginning, I was stagnated for 12 years, I retired as a controller of prisons,

0:16:57.760,0:17:03.020
while people who were less gifted were promoted to Deputy Controller General.

0:17:03.020,0:17:08.500
And I know that by the grace of God, I contributed immensely to turning the face of Nigerian prisons

0:17:08.500,0:17:11.860
around, both within the country and internationally.

0:17:11.860,0:17:14.620
I didn't know it was this demonic force in my family.

0:17:14.620,0:17:21.820
I am telling you who are out there, who is there listening to me right now - come to... Not that there is no God,

0:17:21.820,0:17:27.820
there is God in all churches but grace is imparted upon several people according to their faith.

0:17:27.820,0:17:32.120
Here is a man given to us in this generation by God.

0:17:32.120,0:17:37.520
People are spending thousands, hundreds of thousands dollars to fly from other parts of country

0:17:37.520,0:17:42.180
to come and get what God has given us in Nigeria, and somebody is telling that it's not available.

0:17:42.180,0:17:48.360
Please, for Christ's sake, come and be  baptized and be delivered. Praise God.

0:17:48.360,0:17:58.120
Changing Lives

0:17:58.120,0:18:05.420
We thank you, sir. We know that a lot of people have actually watched and seen the deliverance of Mrs Arakwe

0:18:05.420,0:18:11.000
and have actually commented and sent lots of emails concerning your testimony.

0:18:11.000,0:18:18.580
We would like to read a couple of questions that have been received,

0:18:18.580,0:18:22.120
so we basically have questions from some of our viewers,

0:18:22.120,0:18:25.900
we have time just to read perhaps one or two.

0:18:25.900,0:18:31.240
So we have one from Kelly from Australia and Kelly asks: "As a doctor of Sociology,

0:18:31.240,0:18:37.980
would you have considered your marital problems to be a spiritual issue?"

0:18:37.980,0:18:44.480
Well, as a Christian, Jesus - when He was asked about tax, He said - give what belongs to Caesar to Caesar,

0:18:44.480,0:18:46.380
and what belongs to God to God.

0:18:46.380,0:18:48.080
And I even read political economy.

0:18:48.080,0:18:56.580
In my doctorate dissertation I applied Maximin principles in solving social problems, but that is there.

0:18:56.580,0:19:01.940
But when it comes to spiritual work, I believe God. No academic consolation comes in,

0:19:01.940,0:19:05.520
not for one moment.

0:19:05.520,0:19:08.780
So you realize that despite your education, this was a spiritual issue

0:19:08.780,0:19:10.800
that required spiritual solution.

0:19:10.800,0:19:16.320
Jesus said - give that which belongs to Caesar to Caesar and that which belongs to God to God.

0:19:16.320,0:19:17.820
And that is where I stand.

0:19:17.840,0:19:22.320
My academic convictions, my academic profession can not...

0:19:22.320,0:19:28.540
The Bible says that God has chosen foolish things of this world to confound the wise.

0:19:28.540,0:19:39.000
If I apply academic wisdom in this matter, I will derail. I will just move 100 degrees off my target.

0:19:39.000,0:19:44.400
When you want to come, you come by faith and the faith that moves is the faith in Christ Jesus,

0:19:44.400,0:19:47.860
delivered unto us. Not the law - because if the law were to come in,

0:19:47.860,0:19:51.900
which is conterminous with academics, then Christ died in vain.

0:19:51.900,0:19:54.260
Wow, thank you.

0:19:54.260,0:20:00.480
And we have another question as well; this is from Mr Nigel who is actually in Holland, from Netherlands.

0:20:00.480,0:20:05.660
And he asked: "If this problem had not happened in your life and family,

0:20:05.660,0:20:11.680
do you think you still would have found out more about Prophet T.B. Joshua?"

0:20:11.680,0:20:22.520
Yes. Actually we came here because we had that problem but it took us time.

0:20:22.520,0:20:29.680
We got into this watching Emmanuel TV in 2014 and this is 2017.

0:20:29.680,0:20:34.300
We also had enough faith to believe the man of God, when he is praying

0:20:34.300,0:20:37.520
that we could lay hands on the television and get healed.

0:20:37.520,0:20:42.540
We only came here because we felt this thing was becoming an irritant.

0:20:42.540,0:20:46.860
It was making us look like we were no longer the Christians.

0:20:46.860,0:20:52.560
So we now came here, so that on this mount, we could drop everything and continue our work.

0:20:52.560,0:20:57.520
But it wouldn't have meant anything because when we got glued to that television

0:20:57.520,0:21:03.360
and the marvelous work God was doing here, there was nothing like going back.

0:21:03.360,0:21:05.620
There was no going back.

0:21:05.620,0:21:15.540
Changing Lives

0:21:15.540,0:21:22.680
So at this point we want to hear a few words from Mr Chima, which is the brother of Mrs Augustina.

0:21:22.680,0:21:29.300
So Chima, can we hear from you? I heard that you also have a great testimony concerning a breakthrough.

0:21:29.300,0:21:30.960
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:21:30.960,0:21:33.380
Thank you, my sister.

0:21:33.380,0:21:38.560
My name is Chima Ozerumba, a business man. I live in Abuja.

0:21:38.560,0:21:43.220
And the person beside is my wife Joy Chima Ozerumba.

0:21:43.220,0:21:47.060
We have been in this journey for so long.

0:21:47.060,0:21:53.020
It's just like when the Israelites were crossing the biblical Jordan - it wasn't an easy thing.

0:21:53.020,0:22:00.300
We have gone to so many pastors - they would even see your intestines but they didn't have solution.

0:22:00.300,0:22:05.920
They didn't have solution. But I thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:05.920,0:22:09.740
Immediately my sister called me that I should come,

0:22:09.740,0:22:13.760
that she had that deliverance, a lot of things started happening.

0:22:13.760,0:22:19.020
A document I had been looking for, for two and half years - I said: "God."

0:22:19.020,0:22:23.680
The next thing I said, I heard an instate: "Go to your jeep."

0:22:23.680,0:22:27.100
I went to my jeep, opened the door - I saw the document there.

0:22:27.100,0:22:30.920
A lot of things have been unfolding themselves.

0:22:30.920,0:22:35.700
Because of this family idol we have suffered setback - even my brothers and sisters.

0:22:35.700,0:22:43.500
My sister said the actual thing but today we have reached our promised land.

0:22:43.500,0:22:50.580
All those contracts - people have been calling me concerning those documents they called me so many times -

0:22:50.580,0:22:54.980
if I want them to start it afresh. I said I had not done it, so that they could please do it.

0:22:54.980,0:23:02.240
I didn't know that it was the deliverance my sister had. All these things have started unfolding itself.

0:23:02.240,0:23:05.200
Thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:23:05.200,0:23:11.340
Well, as Prophet T.B.Joshua says: "Whether we plant or water, in Christ we are a team."

0:23:11.340,0:23:18.040
So we believe that God has gifted pastors in different ways. We just give glory to God that it was when you came here,

0:23:18.040,0:23:21.400
that God really opened that door for breakthrough in your family,

0:23:21.400,0:23:25.760
in such a wonderful way. So lets just finally hear a word from our sister as well here.

0:23:25.760,0:23:28.520
What would you like to say about this breakthrough in the whole family?

0:23:28.520,0:23:31.060
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:23:31.060,0:23:33.900
We thank God for today.

0:23:33.900,0:23:37.800
I am Mrs Joy Chima Ozerumba.

0:23:37.800,0:23:40.560
And Augustina is my sister-in-law.

0:23:40.560,0:23:46.740
We thank God for the manifestation of the family idol. The family idol has dealt a great blow in that family.

0:23:46.740,0:23:52.580
It has killed his younger brother, his elderly sister. It has done a lot of harm.

0:23:52.580,0:23:58.360
No breakthrough. Even our son would do WAEC - no results.

0:23:58.360,0:24:01.040
They would seize it and he is very brilliant.

0:24:01.040,0:24:03.360
JAMB - they seized it.

0:24:03.360,0:24:06.840
The day my sister in-law called us, invited us to come,

0:24:06.840,0:24:14.300
that she manifested family idol, I brought his birth certificate, laid it on the floor.

0:24:14.300,0:24:19.760
The New Morning Water was sprinkled on it. The next day he got admission.

0:24:19.760,0:24:26.880
He is in school now. We have been fighting. We spend 500-600 thousand looking for schools for him.

0:24:26.880,0:24:29.060
We have started seeing a lot of breakthroughs.

0:24:29.060,0:24:34.660
I had a pain, a great pain at my spinal cord. I got that Morning Water.

0:24:34.660,0:24:40.300
The thing flew till today. I had a very big boil. I don't know where the boil came from.

0:24:40.300,0:24:49.200
My blood sugar was 401. When I came in contact with the New Morning Water, the thing came to 73.

0:24:49.200,0:24:54.240
I was not eating rice. I didn't eat anything - even no carbs in my diet.

0:24:54.240,0:25:01.360
But since we came, I have been swallowing rice; they were even shouting asking me what is this.

0:25:01.360,0:25:04.600
Thank God for the deliverance.

0:25:04.600,0:25:05.600
Glory be to God.

0:25:05.600,0:25:10.800
To change physically, spiritually and the marriage - in fact, every department of this family.

0:25:10.800,0:25:16.820
Glory be to God. So I think at this point, lets just hear a final word of advice

0:25:16.820,0:25:20.500
from our mother who was the one who actually received that deliverance from the New Morning Water,

0:25:20.500,0:25:24.680
that opened this wonderful door of breakthrough for the whole family.

0:25:24.680,0:25:29.340
So madam, to cap of everything. What is your advice to our viewers?

0:25:29.340,0:25:35.840
My word of advice to viewers all over the world is that when you have this kind

0:25:35.840,0:25:41.040
of problems, don't go away, don't run away from God, run to God.

0:25:41.040,0:25:48.120
Watch Emmanuel TV. It is the faith booster, that is what I call Emmanuel TV.

0:25:48.120,0:25:53.680
Because if you watch it, you will know that your solution must come in the SCOAN.

0:25:53.680,0:25:57.100
That's my advice to viewers all over the world.

0:25:57.100,0:26:02.140
Amen. Thank you so much to the family. And viewers, you heard it from our mother.

0:26:02.140,0:26:08.040
She said Emmanuel TV is faith booster. And we really believe your faith has been boosted,

0:26:08.040,0:26:10.320
has been lifted up by this wonderful testimony.

0:26:10.320,0:26:13.900
And you know, there are several important lessons of life to be learnt.

0:26:13.900,0:26:17.520
We know that in the Christian home, Christian home does not just happen -

0:26:17.520,0:26:22.360
it is built. A Christian home is like a high school of learning,

0:26:22.360,0:26:26.380
where so many truths about life are really learnt. And one of the lessons

0:26:26.380,0:26:32.660
that we really learnt from this experience is that personal fulfillments and improvements in life

0:26:32.660,0:26:41.660
come through the continual process of learning from both positive and negative experiences in life.

0:26:41.660,0:26:47.540
Yes, indeed, we all face spiritual entities  that cause crisis in our marital life, our family

0:26:47.540,0:26:53.640
and our careers. And the tool for these spiritual entities is simply offense.

0:26:53.640,0:26:57.840
Yes, when we feell offended, we begin to use our tongue

0:26:57.840,0:27:04.160
out of bitterness, out of anger and hatred to split churches,

0:27:04.160,0:27:10.300
shatter marriages, crush close relationships and tear homes apart.

0:27:10.300,0:27:15.640
Yes, and we know the Bible says - God is actually the Owner, the Author, the Originator

0:27:15.640,0:27:19.240
of relationships. So since relationships begin with God

0:27:19.240,0:27:25.140
and then overflow to people, we can't just quit from relationships under any circumstance.

0:27:25.140,0:27:29.440
Unless God himself releases us because the beautiful thing about God is that

0:27:29.440,0:27:35.140
He can speak strength through weakness. He can speak strength to us through challenges,

0:27:35.140,0:27:40.620
through difficult circumstances, through all of these issues that arise in our marriage.

0:27:40.620,0:27:44.060
God can actually speak joy in the midst of sadness.

0:27:44.060,0:27:49.740
And in a Christian home, we know that there can be no agreements without disagreements.

0:27:49.740,0:27:53.720
So that disagreement will lead to a higher level of agreement in Christ.

0:27:53.720,0:27:58.580
Indeed, and also there can be no understanding without misunderstanding.

0:27:58.580,0:28:02.780
It might be that this program has gone a long way to let us know

0:28:02.780,0:28:10.180
that even if your marriage is on the verge of divorce, there is hope, and that hope is in Christ Jesus,

0:28:10.180,0:28:15.280
the Anchor of our souls. So viewers, we thank you for watching this program

0:28:15.280,0:28:20.120
Changing Lives. We believe that as you are watching you are learning some secret truths

0:28:20.120,0:28:24.520
that will be changing your life and changing your family's lives and all those around you.

0:28:24.520,0:28:26.900
God bless you. Thank you so much for watching us.

0:28:26.900,0:28:30.900
Until next time, on Changing Lives from me Annette and from me Chris.

0:28:30.900,0:28:32.900
God bless you. Good morning.

0:28:32.900,0:28:49.280
