I want to personally introduce this wonderful cherubim voice in your worship, in your song.

0:00:12.860,0:00:16.760
You can use it as a prayer.

0:00:16.760,0:00:23.560
You can meditate on this while you are about to sleep, before finally sleeping.

0:00:23.560,0:00:25.400
Hallelujah.

0:00:25.400,0:00:28.160
Sin's power.

0:00:28.160,0:00:37.100
Sin's power over me is broken

0:00:37.100,0:00:46.060
Sin's power over us is broken

0:00:46.060,0:00:56.840
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:00:56.840,0:01:05.760
Sin's power over us is broken

0:01:05.760,0:01:15.760
Sin's power over me is broken

0:01:15.760,0:01:24.100

When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:01:34.060,0:01:40.820
Sin's power over us is broken

0:01:40.820,0:01:43.940
Come on, lift your voice and say:

0:01:43.940,0:01:52.900
Sin's power over me is broken

0:01:52.900,0:02:00.940
Sin's power over us is broken

0:02:00.940,0:02:10.920
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:02:10.920,0:02:20.100
Sin's power over us is broken

0:02:20.100,0:02:28.940
Sin's power over me is broken

0:02:28.940,0:02:36.620
Sin's power over us is broken

0:02:36.620,0:02:46.440
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:02:46.440,0:02:55.700
Sin's power over us is broken

0:02:55.700,0:03:03.480
Sin's power over me is broken

0:03:03.480,0:03:11.340
Sin's power over us is broken

0:03:11.340,0:03:21.080
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:03:21.080,0:03:28.740
Sin's power over us is broken

0:03:28.740,0:03:38.460
When Jesus rose I rose
When He rose we rose

0:03:38.460,0:03:48.180
Sin's power over us is broken

0:03:51.000,0:03:59.460
That is for you - for your prayer, for your communion with God.

0:03:59.460,0:04:02.180
So we can sing it now, even without the choristers.

0:04:02.180,0:04:03.740
Let's sing it together.

0:04:03.740,0:04:21.240
Sin's power over us is broken

0:04:21.240,0:04:31.600
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:04:31.600,0:04:38.900

That 'went' represents death.

0:04:50.640,0:04:55.860
When Jesus died - no, He went!

0:04:55.860,0:04:59.180
Spiritually, physically, He is still there for us;

0:04:59.180,0:05:01.300
so, it's 'went', not 'death'.
