My problem is avascular necrosis of the hip.

0:00:07.440,0:00:10.720
I have been using these crutches for four years.

0:00:10.720,0:00:14.140
I can't play with my friends at school.

0:00:14.140,0:00:17.380
I want to walk by myself.

0:00:17.380,0:00:19.240
Please, Man of God, help my son.

0:00:19.240,0:00:21.240

TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:09.880,0:02:13.640
My name is Christine Zennah Kierai.

0:02:13.640,0:02:16.880
The boy beside me is my son, Ramsey.

0:02:16.880,0:02:20.520
The baby here is my baby girl.

0:02:20.520,0:02:22.780
We are from Kenya.

0:02:22.780,0:02:31.960
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the illness of my son.

0:02:31.960,0:02:39.880
He had been suffering for four years with an incurable disease.

0:02:39.880,0:02:48.320
He had difficulty in breathing, chest pain, back pain and the disease even affected the hip.

0:02:48.320,0:02:52.980
So, he used to support himself, using crutches.

0:02:52.980,0:02:55.840
He couldn't play with his friends at school.

0:02:55.840,0:03:01.260
He used to skip school; he would normally go to school twice a week.

0:03:01.260,0:03:07.760
I knew that by coming here, he would receive his healing and deliverance.

0:03:07.760,0:03:18.640
When we were in Kenya, we went to several hospitals but all was in vain.

0:03:18.640,0:03:26.580
The last time I was in the hospital, he was given painkillers and was also booked for an operation.

0:03:26.580,0:03:30.140
Most of the time, I was the one supporting him.

0:03:30.140,0:03:33.180
For how long had he been using the crutches?

0:03:33.180,0:03:35.220
For four years.

0:03:35.220,0:03:38.000
It had affected him mentally and spiritually

0:03:38.000,0:03:41.300
and even in his education, he wasn't performing well.

0:03:41.300,0:03:48.100
When I saw the man of God approaching us, I was shocked and started shivering.

0:03:48.100,0:03:54.580
Then, the man of God laid his hands on my son, meditating and praying.

0:03:54.580,0:04:01.180
Instantly, my son stood up and started walking!

In fact, the pain he was feeling on his chest and back, disappeared immediately.

0:04:16.140,0:04:24.040
He can now walk without crutches, bathe, eat and do everything by himself.

0:04:24.040,0:04:26.240
So you don't need to help him anymore?

0:04:26.240,0:04:26.880
Yes.

0:04:26.880,0:04:29.760
Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!

My name is Ramsey Hammed Odhiambo.

0:04:38.320,0:04:41.060
I am 9 years old.

0:04:41.060,0:04:43.100
I am from Kenya.

0:04:43.100,0:04:47.960
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was avascular necrosis disease,

0:04:47.960,0:04:50.760
which affected my hip bone.

0:04:50.760,0:04:57.660
I couldn't walk by myself; I used crutches.

0:04:57.660,0:05:01.620
I couldn't play with my friends at school or at home.

0:05:01.620,0:05:05.840
My mum used to lock me inside so that I could rest.

0:05:05.840,0:05:11.760
Last week on Sunday, the man of God laid hands on me

0:05:11.760,0:05:16.960
and I suddenly felt something moving in my body.

0:05:16.960,0:05:21.280
I received my healing immediately!

0:05:21.280,0:05:23.140
Healed Of Avascular Necrosis Of The Hip

0:05:23.140,0:05:24.100

0:05:26.660,0:05:29.420
And today, to the glory of God, Ramsey can walk.

0:05:29.420,0:05:33.040
Can you walk in the midst of the children of God to see how you are doing today.

Healed Of Avascular Necrosis Of The Hip
No Longer Using Crutches

0:05:38.440,0:05:42.860
Yes, we can see the little brother walking for the first time in four years.

0:05:42.860,0:05:47.720
Since the man of God prayed for him, the Lord has transformed him.

0:05:47.720,0:05:51.420
Today, he is standing to the glory of God to share his wonderful testimony

0:05:51.420,0:05:56.380
of how God Almighty has wiped away the tears of the family.

0:05:56.380,0:05:59.580
Believe in God and He will fulfill your dream.

0:05:59.580,0:06:02.360
Amen!

0:06:02.360,0:06:05.460
Believe in God and He will fulfill your dream.

0:06:05.460,0:06:08.320
Just as the Lord has done in the life of this little brother,

0:06:08.320,0:06:12.020
He will do it for you, in Jesus' name.

0:06:12.020,0:06:21.380
You should have faith and wait upon the Lord because with God, everything is possible.

0:06:21.380,0:06:25.920
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:06:25.920,0:06:29.180
My name is Christine Zennah Kierai.

0:06:29.180,0:06:32.900
The boy beside me is my son Ramsey Hammed Odhiambo.

0:06:32.900,0:06:36.300
We are from Kenya.

0:06:36.300,0:06:40.540
I would like to say thank you for healing my son.

0:06:40.540,0:06:45.780
I can afford to smile today because my son is walking.

0:06:45.780,0:06:51.640
I have been enduring a lot of pain in the past but now, my past is over.

0:06:51.640,0:06:56.740
Apart from that, I would like to say thank you again to the man of God

0:06:56.740,0:07:02.800
because after healing my son, we were given accommodation free of charge,

0:07:02.800,0:07:06.000
everything was taken care of.

0:07:06.000,0:07:10.000
May God bless him abundantly, in Jesus' name.

0:07:10.000,0:07:15.740
Amen. We thank you for receiving the help from The SCOAN family.

0:07:15.740,0:07:23.160
We are very happy to see him healthy and happy today after what God has done in his life.

0:07:23.160,0:07:25.500
The blessings of God are unlimited.

0:07:25.500,0:07:30.180
That is why before you go, we also want to give this gift to you.

0:07:30.180,0:07:34.020
This is a cash gift of 1,500 USD.

0:07:34.020,0:07:41.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua is actually giving you this as a scholarship for your son,

0:07:41.440,0:07:43.980
for you to take back with you to Kenya.

0:07:43.980,0:07:46.280
I want to thank the man of God.

0:07:46.280,0:07:51.580
May God continue blessing him abundantly.

0:07:51.580,0:07:57.240
What he has done for us - nobody has ever considered us.

0:07:57.240,0:08:00.580
May God bless him for me.

0:08:00.580,0:08:03.300
