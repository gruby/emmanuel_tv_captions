0:00:00.040,0:00:03.000
My name is Dede Folie

0:00:03.000,0:00:08.520
and  this is my daughter Phillipa Aboamah and Lawrence Aboamah

0:00:08.520,0:00:12.060
and this is my granddaughter called Aaliyah Aboamah.

0:00:12.060,0:00:15.400
My testimony goes like:

0:00:15.400,0:00:29.100
On the 12th of April 2016,, my granddaughter fell from the sixth floor in London

0:00:29.100,0:00:35.560
So after that, I rushed down the steps.

0:00:35.560,0:00:44.240
I had pressed the lift but the lift wasn't working so I started running down the steps.

0:00:44.240,0:00:48.320
She couldn't walk; she was totally paralyzed.

0:00:48.320,0:00:52.660
So the ambulance came and took her to the hospital.

0:00:52.660,0:00:55.460
She couldn't walk; she couldn't do anything.

0:00:55.460,0:01:05.860
I then went home. I was having the Anointed Water at home which I had gotten from The SCOAN.

0:01:05.860,0:01:11.240
So when I went home, I took the Anointed Water with me back to the hospital.

0:01:11.240,0:01:16.260
When I got to the hospital, I sprayed the water on her.

0:01:16.260,0:01:21.860
After I had sprayed the water, she started moving the first hand,

0:01:21.860,0:01:29.900
the second hand, her leg, and the second leg.

0:01:29.900,0:01:36.060
Before she moved her legs, I was holding the Holy Water.

0:01:36.060,0:01:41.760
I sprayed it on her. I said, "In the mighty name of Jesus, Aaliyah, be healed!

0:01:41.760,0:01:46.300
Raise up your leg!" because she wasn't doing anything, she couldn't raise her leg up.

0:01:46.300,0:01:51.460
She couldn't raise anything up. She was totally paralyzed so I just sprayed the water.

0:01:51.460,0:01:55.640
I said again, "In the mighty name of Jesus, Aaliyah, be healed! Raise your leg up!"

0:01:55.640,0:01:58.920
because it was left with one leg. She couldn't raise it up.

0:01:58.920,0:02:04.280
Immediately I sprinkled the Anointed Water, she raised her leg up.

0:02:04.280,0:02:08.240
Everybody was shouting and my daughter said, "Oh Mummy!"

0:02:08.240,0:02:10.920
After ministering the Morning Water, she began to walk. Is that correct?

0:02:10.920,0:02:11.600
Yes.

0:02:11.600,0:02:14.500
Ok. What happened today when you brought her to The SCOAN?

0:02:14.500,0:02:21.080
When I brought her to The SCOAN, she wasn't walking properly because of her spine.

0:02:21.080,0:02:25.860
She was always falling; she kept on falling. She couldn't walk properly.

0:02:25.860,0:02:35.180
So when we brought her now, by the grace of God, when Prophet T.B. Joshua came

0:02:35.180,0:02:38.940
and prayed for her, she started walking.

0:02:38.940,0:02:44.240
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:02:44.240,0:02:52.560
She was having a body brace and a foot brace.

0:02:52.560,0:02:55.240
Ok. What happened today when the prophet laid his hand on her?

0:02:55.240,0:03:01.260
After the prophet prayed for her, without the brace, she is alright now.

0:03:01.260,0:03:03.080
She began to walk.

0:03:03.080,0:03:05.820
Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that!

0:03:05.820,0:03:08.620

Morning Water Testimony

0:03:08.620,0:03:18.220
This was the newspaper - they wrote about it in the newspaper.

0:03:18.220,0:03:29.020
It was written there: "It is a miracle she's walking again."

0:03:29.020,0:03:32.720
Dede Folie & Family
Morning Water Testimony

0:03:32.720,0:03:38.300
The fact that Aaliyah is able to walk today is remarkable.

0:03:38.300,0:03:45.000
She fell from this top floor window breaking her spine just six weeks ago.

0:03:45.000,0:03:47.860
Doctors feared she would never walk again.

0:03:47.860,0:03:54.000
I was just like in shock. I went running downstairs and whilst I was even running downstairs,

0:03:54.000,0:03:57.140
I was calling an ambulance. The woman wasn't getting the address.

0:03:57.140,0:04:03.240
She wasn't getting anything I was trying to say to her because I was so much in tears.

0:04:03.240,0:04:09.340
Still in the hospital but recovering fast, saved by a fortunate sequence of events.

0:04:09.340,0:04:14.200
When Aaliyah's mum got there, a witness persuaded her not to move the two-year-old,

0:04:14.200,0:04:17.160
protecting Aaliyah from further back injury.

0:04:17.160,0:04:21.440
At the time she was moaning, "Mum, mum!"

0:04:21.440,0:04:28.080
I replied, "Yes". Then the man told me, "You cant touch her because you will mess up the bones

0:04:28.080,0:04:30.020
in her body further because she has broken bones".

0:04:30.020,0:04:32.840
I think he knew that she had broken bones.

0:04:32.840,0:04:37.560
He was a blessing to actually be there because I would have carried her.

0:04:37.560,0:04:41.720
It's only when you are here that you get an idea of the scale of this fall.

0:04:41.720,0:04:45.600
We are on the ground floor. 50 feet higher is the fifth floor

0:04:45.600,0:04:48.340
and that's how far Aaliyah fell

0:04:48.340,0:04:53.540
It was extremely lucky that she didn't suffer much more serious injuries.

0:04:53.540,0:04:56.320
She could have indeed lost her life.

0:04:56.320,0:05:03.100
The speed with which she has recovered is very, very impressive.

0:05:03.100,0:05:07.780
1.2.3.4.5.6.7......

0:05:07.780,0:05:13.000
Where she fell from, the windows were open, there were satellite dishes.

0:05:13.000,0:05:17.880
I was just in shock. It was heartbreaking. It was traumatising.

0:05:17.880,0:05:23.480
And it was like, how did she not hit all the windows or the satellite dishes?

0:05:23.480,0:05:27.240
itv news

0:05:27.240,0:05:30.060
This was after you had administered the Morning Water on her.

0:05:30.060,0:05:33.580
After I had administered the Morning Water, she started walking.

0:05:33.580,0:05:35.360
She got out of the hospital bed and began to walk.

0:05:35.360,0:05:36.720
Yes, she began to walk.

0:05:36.720,0:05:40.400
It was amazing anyway because they were surprised.

0:05:40.400,0:05:43.920
All of them were asking me, "Oh how did you do it?"

0:05:43.920,0:05:47.280
because all of them had said that the baby wouldn't walk again.

0:05:47.280,0:05:51.280
After falling from such a height, she was supposed to be paralysed.

0:05:51.280,0:05:54.180
So the doctor told her that she was not going to walk again.

0:05:54.180,0:05:57.320
They even got her a wheelchair, everything for her,

0:05:57.320,0:06:00.020
and I told her, "I am serving a living God.

0:06:00.020,0:06:03.720
My granddaughter is going to walk again, in the name of Jesus!"

0:06:03.720,0:06:07.860
Then they said, "Oh". Another guy asked me, "Which church are you attending?"

0:06:07.860,0:06:12.700
I said, "I am attending The Synagogue Church Of All Nations".

0:06:12.700,0:06:15.120
You finally brought her to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations today...

0:06:15.120,0:06:15.760
Yes

0:06:15.760,0:06:19.620
...because her spinal cord was fractured and she was not steady in her movement.

0:06:19.620,0:06:20.920
Yes, she wasn't steady in her movement.

0:06:20.920,0:06:22.720
And what happened today when the prophet laid his hand on her?

0:06:22.720,0:06:26.040
When the prophet laid his hand on her, she started walking alright,

0:06:26.040,0:06:28.420
moving alright and everything was ok with her.

0:06:28.420,0:06:33.280
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:06:33.280,0:06:39.940
Ok. Let's hear briefly from the mother of the girl.

0:06:39.940,0:06:42.380
Tell us your name and where you come from.

0:06:42.380,0:06:48.320
My name is Phillipa Oboamah and I'm coming from London.

0:06:48.320,0:06:51.260
I just want to thank God for everything that He has done for me

0:06:51.260,0:06:53.840
because without Hi,m I dont think I would be here.

0:06:53.840,0:07:09.180
I think I would be going through stress or depression now if I hadn't turned to Him.

0:07:09.180,0:07:12.820
You heard it from her. She said that she is the mother of this little girl who had that accident

0:07:12.820,0:07:15.160
because she fell from the height of 60 feet.

0:07:15.160,0:07:21.780
Hello. I am Lawrence Boamah. This is my sister, my mum and my niece Aaliyah.

0:07:21.780,0:07:25.960
I would like to thank God for what He has done in my family's life and everything

0:07:25.960,0:07:30.100
because we never knew she would walk again.

0:07:30.100,0:07:32.460
She was actually having difficulty in walking

0:07:32.460,0:07:35.860
until my mum sprayed the Anointing Water on her.

0:07:35.860,0:07:39.460
It was just amazing because everyone in the hospital was shocked.

0:07:39.460,0:07:42.740
They were saying, "Ah, she wont walk again" and stuff like that.

0:07:42.740,0:07:44.540
My mum was praying all the time.

0:07:44.540,0:07:50.940
Everyone was praying with the Morning Water, praying to the God of T.B. Joshua.

0:07:50.940,0:07:53.640
I would like to thank God for what He has done in my family's life.

0:07:53.640,0:07:57.880
Ok. What happened to the life of your niece today when the prophet laid his hand on her?

0:07:57.880,0:08:02.580
After the prophet had laid his hand on my niece, she is walking alright now.

0:08:02.580,0:08:06.640
The brace is off now. As you can see, she is walking without the brace.

0:08:06.640,0:08:10.580
Ok. Now she doesnt need the brace anymore. What do you want to do with it?

0:08:10.580,0:08:12.020
I will throw it away.

0:08:12.020,0:08:17.760
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:08:17.760,0:08:21.280
That is a clear proof that the little girl is completely free.

0:08:21.280,0:08:25.440
You heard it all. They said that they no longer want to use the body brace anymore

0:08:25.440,0:08:27.440
for this little girl because she is completely free.

0:08:27.440,0:08:30.700
Can you now go to the notice board and tell us the pictures we seeing there?

0:08:30.700,0:08:32.140
Explain the pictures.

0:08:32.140,0:08:36.940
Alright, This is a picture of when she fell and she was in an ambulance.

0:08:36.940,0:08:38.840
This one over here.

0:08:38.840,0:08:42.880
And this was when she was in intensive care.

0:08:42.880,0:08:47.360
This was when she wasn't even moving her leg - both of these pictures.

0:08:47.360,0:08:49.460
In all of these pictures she wasn't moving her leg

0:08:49.460,0:08:53.240
until my mum sprayed the Anointing Water. Then she started walking.

0:08:53.240,0:08:56.440
There are more pictures.

0:08:56.440,0:08:59.920
These are all pictures of when she was in intensive care.

0:08:59.920,0:09:03.540
So after ministering the Morning Water, she was actually the one who stood there.

0:09:03.540,0:09:05.980
She was walking. She wasn't even sitting on these things.

0:09:05.980,0:09:09.540
She wasn't sitting on these wheelchairs again. She was just walking around,

0:09:09.540,0:09:11.220
and that's when they gave her the brace.

0:09:11.220,0:09:14.920
When the prophet laid his hands on her, she started walking okay

0:09:14.920,0:09:17.080
and as you can see, she is walking okay.

0:09:17.080,0:09:21.220
Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that!

0:09:21.220,0:09:24.500
And finally, what word of advice do you have, Mama,

0:09:24.500,0:09:27.680
for what the Lord has done in the life of your granddaughter?

0:09:27.680,0:09:33.700
The advice I have for my fellow brothers and sisters:

0:09:33.700,0:09:38.960
Whenever you have a problem, seek the favour of God.

0:09:39.040,0:09:41.520
He is the only one who will help you.

0:09:41.520,0:09:42.920
Amen

0:09:42.920,0:09:47.320
I just want to say that everyone should watch their child wherever they go

0:09:47.320,0:09:50.440
and just give your faith to Christ.

0:09:50.440,0:09:53.860
Amen. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in the life of the little girl

0:09:53.860,0:09:57.140
as we can see her moving around. This is a clear proof that she could walk

0:09:57.140,0:10:00.200
after the touch from His able servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:10:00.200,0:10:02.440
As you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,

0:10:02.440,0:10:04.740
we pray your miracle will remain permanent, in Jesus' name

0:10:04.740,0:10:05.340
Amen.

0:10:05.340,0:10:06.500
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
