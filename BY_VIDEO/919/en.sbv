PRAYER TIME

0:00:04.040,0:00:08.660
Stretch your hand.

0:00:08.660,0:00:12.000
Are you in an attitude of prayer?

0:00:12.000,0:00:13.540
Like I have said,

0:00:13.540,0:00:19.020
faith releases healing power.

0:00:19.020,0:00:22.740
Faith releases blessing.

0:00:22.740,0:00:35.420
Faith is like a vacuum that draws anointing from God.

0:00:35.420,0:00:38.380
You're building faith.

0:00:38.380,0:00:42.280
You are like a ball - it is pumped but it is not well pumped.

0:00:42.280,0:00:46.800
But the more you are saying, take more of me, give me more of you, you are pumping the ball.

0:00:46.800,0:00:54.220
Take more of me, give me more of you. You see the ball becoming big.

0:00:54.220,0:00:56.840
You are the ball.

0:00:56.840,0:00:59.780
So if you stop, you stop pumping.

0:00:59.780,0:01:03.600
And if you continue, the ball will continue to grow big.

0:01:03.600,0:01:04.920
You are the ball.

0:01:04.920,0:01:07.720
The air that enters is that faith.

0:01:07.720,0:01:12.300
The word you are saying - take more of me, give me more of you - it's so strong.

0:01:12.300,0:01:14.080
It's spirit prayer.

0:01:14.080,0:01:25.020
When you get that ball to stand and at the level you can play it, you begin to eat with Jesus.

0:01:25.020,0:01:27.520
see visions and dream dreams.

0:01:27.520,0:01:29.500
Your heart will begin to talk to you.

0:01:29.500,0:01:33.000
You don't need to sleep to see vision; it's the heart that talks to us.

0:01:33.000,0:01:37.240
You'll be moving. Your heart would say, Don't go there, go back.

0:01:37.240,0:01:38.480
Who is talking to you?

0:01:38.480,0:01:45.440
It's your heart, pumped by faith - get it working.

0:01:45.440,0:01:50.320
See with your heart and not with your eye.

0:01:50.320,0:01:54.600
Stretch your hand.

0:01:54.600,0:02:00.800
Every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be broken, in Jesus' name!

0:02:00.800,0:02:03.420
[Amen]

0:02:03.420,0:02:06.020
We want to fight this barrier.

0:02:06.020,0:02:11.180
Whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:11.180,0:02:13.460
[Amen]

0:02:13.460,0:02:15.580
Be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:15.580,0:02:18.000
[Amen]

0:02:18.000,0:02:25.180
What could be the barrier? - It could be offence you are holding against your neighbour.

0:02:25.180,0:02:30.680
You say, over your dead body, you will not forgive!

0:02:30.680,0:02:39.900
Are you holding an offence, grudges, hatred, bitterness or pain of the past?

0:02:39.900,0:02:44.100
Be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:44.100,0:02:51.000
I want you to stretch your hand and begin to remove whatever satan might have used to connect you.

0:02:51.000,0:02:57.020
He uses offence to connect us. He uses grudges to connect us to himself.

0:02:57.020,0:03:06.180
He uses pain of the past to connect us to himself. He uses bitterness to connect us to himself.

0:03:06.180,0:03:22.580
Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself, begin to disconnect yourself!

0:03:22.580,0:03:24.740
Disconnect yourself!

0:03:24.740,0:03:29.780
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:03:29.780,0:03:34.800
I want to believe you are with a free spirit.

0:03:34.800,0:03:46.540
A free spirit is a spirit that joins with the Spirit of God.

0:03:46.540,0:03:48.220
Right now.

0:03:48.220,0:03:52.720
Whatever strange spirit around, within or outside,

0:03:52.720,0:03:58.680
we want to put them where they belong, we want to tell them where they should go.

0:03:58.680,0:04:00.420
Right now.

0:04:00.420,0:04:02.560

0:04:16.150,0:04:26.720
Whatever spirit - within or outside that torments your business, life, that stands in your way -

0:04:26.720,0:04:28.340
[Out!]

0:04:28.340,0:04:41.260
be cursed, in the name of Jesus!

Every enemy shall surrender.

0:04:58.540,0:05:02.800

0:05:02.800,0:05:09.780
Surrender!

0:07:27.080,0:07:34.440
I'm a giant man. I want to kill her.

0:07:34.440,0:07:38.320
What have you done to her?

0:07:38.320,0:07:42.500
I caused her barrenness; I want to destroy her.

0:11:20.660,0:11:26.800
Tell your neighbour, do you know yourself? Do you know you have been delivered?

0:11:26.800,0:11:29.040
