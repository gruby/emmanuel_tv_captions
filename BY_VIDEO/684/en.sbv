PROPHECY TIME

0:00:04.460,0:00:06.100
Hallelujah.

0:00:06.100,0:00:13.460
The brother under the canopy - your wife is at home but you are here with a lady.

0:00:13.460,0:00:17.880
What kind of prayer you want to offer?

0:00:17.880,0:00:21.500
What do you hear us preaching since morning?

0:00:21.500,0:00:28.920
Your wife is at home. She is even trying to cook food for you but you are here with one lady.

0:00:28.920,0:00:31.740
For salvation or for what?

0:00:31.740,0:00:33.060
For marriage.

0:00:33.060,0:00:36.780
If you don't come out, you are here to tempt me.

0:00:36.780,0:00:41.920
If you tempt the man of God, you know the repercussion. You have to come out, please.

0:00:41.920,0:00:43.900
Salvation first.

0:00:43.900,0:00:46.500
You will not be able to help yourself.

0:00:46.500,0:00:47.820
God loves you. Thank you.

0:00:47.820,0:00:48.920
Hallelujah.

0:00:48.920,0:00:52.960
This man comes forward in response to the prophecy of the man of God.

0:00:52.960,0:00:57.040
Man of God, I am the man who came here with my girlfriend while my wife is at home.

0:00:57.040,0:00:59.820
What has your wife done to you?

0:00:59.820,0:01:02.200
She didn't do anything.

0:01:02.200,0:01:04.100
And she's beautiful - you like her?

0:01:04.100,0:01:04.700
Yes.

0:01:04.700,0:01:06.380
It is urge.

0:01:06.380,0:01:09.800
I came with the girl. The girl is my girlfriend in Angola.

0:01:09.800,0:01:11.720
Where is the girl?

0:01:11.720,0:01:12.860
She is at the back.

0:01:12.860,0:01:16.680
No, respect others. This is the man I called.

0:01:16.680,0:01:18.820
After the service, I want to see you and her.

0:01:18.820,0:01:21.420
Okay? I want to see her because you are the cause.

0:01:21.420,0:01:24.320
We are going to ask God the way out.

0:01:24.320,0:01:26.160
Thank you, my brother.

0:01:26.160,0:01:30.520
PROPHECY CONFIRMATION

0:01:30.520,0:01:32.980
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:32.980,0:01:35.340
My name is Kelechukwu John.

0:01:35.340,0:01:42.040
The woman beside me is my wife, Chioma John.

0:01:42.040,0:01:46.760
I'm the one the man of God prophesied about last Sunday that I came with my girlfriend.

0:01:46.760,0:01:49.800
It started in Angola.

0:01:49.800,0:01:57.480
When I newly got there, I met her and she said that she would help me and give me documents.

0:01:57.480,0:02:01.240
That's why we started.

0:02:01.240,0:02:04.960
Whenever she came to my house, we would like to watch Emmanuel TV.

0:02:04.960,0:02:09.820
She said that she liked the man of God and would one day like to visit Nigeria.

0:02:09.820,0:02:14.100
Two Fridays ago, she called me saying that she was in Cotonou,

0:02:14.100,0:02:15.940
that I should come and pick her up.

0:02:15.940,0:02:20.160
I went to pick her up and brought her to The SCOAN

0:02:20.160,0:02:24.620
and the man of God gave us a prophecy.

0:02:24.620,0:02:28.700
After the prophecy, I realised my mistakes.

0:02:28.700,0:02:33.560
I'm sorry, Man of God, for doing such a thing.

0:02:33.560,0:02:38.400
I am also pleading for my wife to forgive me because she did not know anything about it.

0:02:38.400,0:02:43.140
My wife trusted me and did not think that I would do such a thing.

0:02:43.140,0:02:48.700
Man of God, I am sorry; forgive me for what I did.

0:02:48.700,0:02:53.700
She asked me about my wife and I told her that the man of God had invited my wife.

0:02:53.700,0:03:01.180
She said that she could not stand the challenge and went back.

0:03:01.180,0:03:07.580
So your girlfriend has actually left now after hearing that the man of God was inviting your wife?

0:03:07.580,0:03:09.060
She left.

0:03:09.060,0:03:13.060
Right now as your wife is here, what do you want to say to your wife?

0:03:13.060,0:03:22.420
All I want to say is that she should forgive me for what I did. I'm sorry, baby.

0:03:22.420,0:03:26.880
We thank God. Our brother said that after the word of prophecy, he realised his mistake.

0:03:26.880,0:03:29.240
That it was as if his eyes opened.

0:03:29.240,0:03:33.700
We thank God Almighty for how that word of prophecy not only brought our sister here

0:03:33.700,0:03:39.620
but also brought deliverance to our brother who was having a girlfriend all the way in Angola.

0:03:39.620,0:03:44.260
Let's just hear a word from our sister.

0:03:44.260,0:03:47.020
Madam, you're welcome. Just introduce yourself to us.

0:03:47.020,0:03:48.740
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:03:48.740,0:03:51.360
My name is Chioma Kelechukwu.

0:03:51.360,0:03:54.180
I am from Nigeria.

0:03:54.180,0:04:00.480
On Tuesday, I got a call that the man of God and Emmanuel TV team wanted to see me.

0:04:00.480,0:04:04.080
I came and they explained what was happening.

0:04:04.080,0:04:08.200
I was surprised and did not know what to do.

0:04:08.200,0:04:12.100
I trusted my husband and did not think that he could do such a thing.

0:04:12.100,0:04:18.040
Nevertheless, to God be the glory, I got my deliverance at The SCOAN.

0:04:18.040,0:04:22.700
I thank God and Emmanuel TV for helping me recover my home.

0:04:22.700,0:04:24.040
Thank you.

0:04:24.040,0:04:28.000
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:04:28.000,0:04:31.420
We give glory to the Lord God Almighty that this prophecy came forth.

0:04:31.420,0:04:36.540
As you are standing here right now in the presence of God, madam, what do you want to say to your husband?

0:04:36.540,0:04:38.360
I have forgiven him!

0:04:38.360,0:04:44.760
Thank You, Jesus Christ. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:04:44.760,0:04:53.440
I advise every home to know God first so that God will help you recover your family.

0:04:53.440,0:04:54.500
Thank you.

Mr & Mrs Kelechukwu John 
(Prophecy Confirmation)

0:04:57.280,0:05:00.400
Hallelujah. Once again, madam, for the benefit of our viewers,

0:05:00.400,0:05:06.580
as you're standing here in the presence of God now, what do you want to say to your husband?

0:05:06.580,0:05:09.360
Who am I? I have already forgiven him.

0:05:09.360,0:05:13.140
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:13.140,0:05:16.220
Glory be to God. We know that if not for God's intervention,

0:05:16.220,0:05:21.760
an issue like this could have easily led to many things - talk of divorce, separation or whatever.

0:05:21.760,0:05:26.060
But we thank God that as God revealed it, He also redeemed this marriage,

0:05:26.060,0:05:28.040
and we thank Jesus Christ for what He has done.

0:05:28.040,0:05:30.820
We want to hear a final word from our brother as well.

0:05:30.820,0:05:36.460
My advice to every couple is that there is no need to look outside -

0:05:36.460,0:05:43.260
stay with your wife, place your hope in her and do everything with her.

0:05:43.260,0:05:50.420
Amen. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:50.420,0:05:51.960
We thank God for your life, sir,

0:05:51.960,0:05:57.600
and we pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this resolution you've made right now.

0:05:57.600,0:06:00.620
As you here in the presence of God, we know your past is over

0:06:00.620,0:06:04.880
and we believe you and your wife will come back with a wonderful testimony, in Jesus' name.

0:06:04.880,0:06:06.420
Amen.
