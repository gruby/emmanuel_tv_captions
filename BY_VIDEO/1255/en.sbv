Good Morning!

0:00:04.920,0:00:09.540
Good Morning. Good Morning. It is a new dawn.

0:00:09.540,0:00:16.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:16.860,0:00:20.500
Hallelujah!

0:00:20.500,0:00:23.760
I know your faith is lifted up.

0:00:23.760,0:00:26.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:26.960,0:00:32.060
There is no way our faith can be lifted up without repentance.

0:00:32.060,0:00:34.020
Do you know that?

0:00:34.020,0:00:41.740
The Bible says that sin is never covered by our appearance.

0:00:41.740,0:00:44.520
This is what we believe today.

0:00:44.520,0:00:48.560
Sin is never covered by our appearance

0:00:48.560,0:00:49.820
Tell your neighbour.

0:00:49.820,0:00:53.160
[Sin is never covered by our appearance.]

0:00:53.160,0:00:57.140
Wrong is never covered by our prayer.

0:00:57.140,0:01:01.080
Prayer without repentance - we are talking to the air,

0:01:01.080,0:01:06.600
you are just making noise.

0:01:06.600,0:01:08.280
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:08.280,0:01:18.460
Our wrong, our sin, our mistake is never covered by our prayer.

0:01:18.460,0:01:33.040
I mean, prayer without repentance is never covered by our tears.

0:01:33.040,0:01:39.220
Sin can only be removed by repentance.

0:01:39.220,0:01:43.180
Wrong can only be removed by repentance.

0:01:43.180,0:01:46.460
And what is repentance? Simple.

0:01:46.460,0:01:54.120
You begin to step into repentance when you stop blaming others.

0:01:54.120,0:01:57.980
Your business is not good, you say, "Oh, it's witchcraft.

0:01:57.980,0:02:00.060
That is how it happened to our family -

0:02:00.060,0:02:03.160
my brother is not making it, my sister is not making it".

0:02:03.160,0:02:08.340
But when you are making it, when business is good, you say, "It's my hard working.

0:02:08.340,0:02:12.060
I am a graduate, I am a professor".

0:02:12.060,0:02:14.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:14.720,0:02:19.960
When the goings are good, and you are making it, business is flourishing,

0:02:19.960,0:02:26.200
you say, "Oh my God, I wake up early in the morning, I clicked to my business".

0:02:26.200,0:02:29.220
You know what I am talking about.

0:02:29.220,0:02:35.620
But when business is bad, you begin to look for witches.

0:02:35.620,0:02:37.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:37.640,0:02:42.280
You decide not to go home; you abandon your village because business is not going.

0:02:42.280,0:02:45.160
They are the ones haunting you.

0:02:45.160,0:02:48.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:48.120,0:02:52.680
Repentance comes when we stop blaming others

0:02:52.680,0:02:54.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:02:54.040,0:02:56.980
[Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.]

0:02:56.980,0:02:58.480
I can't hear you.

0:02:58.480,0:03:01.180
[Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.]

0:03:01.180,0:03:05.540
When it happens to you, you say, "Yes" - reproach

0:03:05.540,0:03:07.280
because of the pain you are going through.

0:03:07.280,0:03:11.500
Who is going through the pain? Is it witchcraft?

0:03:11.500,0:03:15.620
What you are going through, who is going through it? Is it wizard?

0:03:15.620,0:03:19.920
It is you that is going through the pain.

0:03:19.920,0:03:29.080
Tell your neighbour, "Repentance comes when you stop blaming others".

0:03:29.080,0:03:35.700
"I have been married for many years, no child, I have been barren.

0:03:35.700,0:03:41.160
Things have been very difficult. It is the same thing with my brothers at home.

0:03:41.160,0:03:45.800
This is trouble in the family."

0:03:45.800,0:03:50.580
You are shifting the blame.

0:03:50.580,0:03:56.220
But when things are good, you say it's your work.

0:03:56.220,0:04:03.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:03.760,0:04:11.820
Sin can only be removed by repentance.

0:04:11.820,0:04:23.160
It must be brought to the Blood of Jesus before the Spirit prays through us.

0:04:23.160,0:04:26.480
Our situation to where?

0:04:26.480,0:04:27.480
I can't hear you.

0:04:27.480,0:04:28.380
[Blood of Jesus.]

0:04:28.380,0:04:41.860
It must be brought to the Blood of Jesus before the Spirit prays through us.

0:04:41.860,0:04:45.580
The Blood of Jesus

0:04:45.580,0:04:55.020
The Blood of Jesus sets me free
From sin and sorrow

0:04:55.020,0:05:01.140
The Blood of Jesus sets me free

0:05:01.140,0:05:04.720
The Blood of Jesus

0:05:04.720,0:05:15.300
The Blood of Jesus sets me free
From sin and sorrow

0:05:15.300,0:05:23.240
The Blood of Jesus sets me free

0:05:23.240,0:05:33.580
It must be brought to the Blood of Christ before the Spirit prays through us.

0:05:33.580,0:05:39.700
We don't know how to pray; the Spirit prays.

MESSAGE TITLE: REPENTANCE

0:05:43.720,0:05:47.960
What do you think can hold you back?

0:05:47.960,0:06:07.800
Pain of the past, anger, hurt of the past - deep hurt.

0:06:07.800,0:06:13.080
"The man came from the village, the boy came from the village, the lady came from the village.

0:06:13.080,0:06:17.820
I homed him, I homed her. He lived with me.

0:06:17.820,0:06:20.940
I trained him, I sent him to university.

0:06:20.940,0:06:26.640
I trained him. Now he is a millionaire but he abandoned me.

0:06:26.640,0:06:31.340
He refused to pay me back. I will not forgive him."

0:06:31.340,0:06:33.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:33.100,0:06:37.780
There is a lot of issue with you and your people.

0:06:37.780,0:06:48.940
"I trained him. He is the head of the company but he refuses to hear from me again."

0:06:48.940,0:06:53.680
This pain of the past.

0:06:53.680,0:06:57.240
In your spirit now you rise and say to the Lord:

0:06:57.240,0:07:09.960
Give me the Grace to forget the pain of the past and be kind to those who hurt me.

0:07:09.960,0:07:13.480
Say it again.

0:07:13.480,0:07:25.080
Lord, give me the grace to forget the pain of the past, injustice of the past,

0:07:25.080,0:07:32.060
cheats of the past and to be kind to those who hurt me.

0:07:32.060,0:07:37.240
Oh my God, you are hurt. You have been cheated.

0:07:37.240,0:07:41.680
These are the things that are holding you back.

0:07:41.680,0:07:50.460
Oh, they sacked you, injustice, sacked you without pay,

0:07:50.460,0:07:56.520
even unnoticed sack letter after serving for many years.

0:07:56.520,0:08:03.620
You say, "No, this is injustice you will never forget and forgive".

0:08:03.620,0:08:05.740
You must forgive.

0:08:05.740,0:08:07.780
This is what is holding you back.

0:08:07.780,0:08:16.760
"No! My wife, my husband threw my things out after building his career and his future.

0:08:16.760,0:08:21.040
Now he is a rich man. Look, he married a new wife.

0:08:21.040,0:08:26.820
And here I am out there. I will never forgive this man."

0:08:26.820,0:08:30.340
These are the things that are holding you back.

0:08:30.340,0:08:40.420
"Oh, I can never. This is so painful. I hate him."

0:08:40.420,0:08:49.840
"I brought him up. See today, he is calling me wizard, witch. I can never..."

0:08:49.840,0:08:52.260
These are the things that are holding you back.

0:08:52.260,0:08:59.120
See Jesus - "Father, forgive them."

What you have forgotten is that

0:09:55.580,0:10:03.340
God often uses circumstances of life to preserve us.

0:10:03.340,0:10:12.420
Those things you see as pain, cheating, injustice -

0:10:12.420,0:10:41.080
God often uses them to preserve us, to keep us, to train us, to rebuild us but we don't know.

0:10:41.080,0:10:43.980
Are you with me?

0:10:43.980,0:10:52.660
God often uses circumstances of life.

0:10:52.660,0:10:58.700
You have been praying to be this, to be a senator, to be a president, to be that.

0:10:58.700,0:11:03.120
If you had been a president, who knows what would have happened to you?

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:19.340,0:11:21.200
Ask your neighbour:

0:11:21.200,0:11:29.760
What I have been praying for in the past - fasting and praying -

0:11:29.760,0:11:39.400
if my prayer had been answered, who knows what would have happened?

0:11:39.400,0:11:43.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:43.640,0:11:51.940
God often uses circumstance of life.

0:11:51.940,0:11:55.020
And what are the circumstances?

0:11:55.020,0:12:06.360
What you see as injustice, hate, cheating, pain.

0:12:06.360,0:12:11.960
"This is embarrassment, this is cheating - he cheated me!"

"He sacked me, unnoticed, after serving for many years which is injustice."

0:12:27.580,0:12:40.320
Sometimes, God uses this kind of situation to preserve, to keep us for a new level

0:12:40.320,0:12:47.520
and to prepare us for a bright future.

0:12:47.520,0:12:52.040

Give us the grace, Lord, to forget the pain of the past.

0:13:09.380,0:13:12.120
Pain can be this, can be that, can be injustice -

0:13:12.120,0:13:15.620
whatever pain, to forget the pain of the past.

0:13:15.620,0:13:28.520
Not only to forget the pain of the past - to be kind to those who hurt us in the past.

0:13:28.520,0:13:29.900
Open your lips, ask God

0:13:29.900,0:13:38.000

That is the only way to maintain what you have received.

0:14:23.740,0:14:28.480
If you know you have received, you need maintenance.

0:14:28.480,0:14:34.420
Give me the grace to live according to Your Word.

0:14:34.420,0:14:44.480
Your Word says, "Thou shall not kill, thou shall not lie, thou shall not steal, thou shall not destroy."

0:14:44.480,0:14:52.520
Give me the grace, Lord, to live according to your Word.
