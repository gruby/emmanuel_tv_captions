every spirit that stands against you,

every spirit that hinders you,

every spirit that causes shortcomings.

Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:02:09.260,0:02:16.460
Viewers all over the world, you have been
claiming your right;

0:02:16.460,0:02:19.300
there is nothing wrong with that.

0:02:19.300,0:02:25.680
You can claim your right
but don't hold unto an offence.

0:02:25.680,0:02:31.640
You can claim your right but don't hold onto an offence.

0:02:31.640,0:02:38.780
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold onto an offence.

0:02:38.780,0:02:42.640
You must be free from offence.

0:02:42.640,0:02:48.300
Offences imprison you - self-imprisonment.

0:02:48.300,0:02:52.000
When you hold onto an offence, you have imprisoned yourself.

0:02:52.000,0:02:54.680
Offence of this.
Offence of that.

0:02:54.680,0:02:56.480
You have imprisoned yourself.

0:02:56.480,0:03:02.640
The Bible says, our spirit must be free to contact the Spirit of God.

0:03:02.640,0:03:06.880
Viewers, listen! Your spirit must be free.

0:03:06.880,0:03:12.840
I am not saying that you should not claim your right,
but don't hold onto an offence.

0:03:12.840,0:03:19.760
Offences imprison one.

0:03:19.760,0:03:25.040
Your spirit must be free from all offences.

0:03:25.040,0:03:31.760
Wrong accusation, whatever it is -
whether you are right or wrong,

0:03:31.760,0:03:38.380
your spirit must be free to contact the Spirit of God.

0:03:38.380,0:03:41.980
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:41.980,0:03:45.800
I release your spirit from the pain of the past!

0:03:45.800,0:03:49.180
I release your spirit from past accusation!

0:03:49.180,0:03:59.400
I release your spirit from the pain of the past - past persecution, past pain - be released!

0:03:59.400,0:04:02.420
I say to your spirit, be released!

0:04:02.420,0:04:08.500
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:08.500,0:04:11.640
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:04:11.640,0:04:20.300
I know you are going through major trouble, hatred, persecution,

0:04:20.300,0:04:27.400
whatever you are going through - misjudged or whatever.

0:04:27.400,0:04:30.560
You have no right to hold onto an offence.

0:04:30.560,0:04:35.860
I release you from the pain of the past, in the name of Jesus.

0:04:35.860,0:04:41.620
I release you from hurt - I mean deep hurt, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:41.620,0:04:45.920
There is hurt, and there is deep hurt.

0:04:45.920,0:04:49.940
Someone will say, "I can never forgive".

0:04:49.940,0:04:52.940
"No, no, no."

0:04:52.940,0:04:54.400
It is deep hurt.

0:04:54.400,0:05:00.900
I release you from hurt - deep hurt, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:00.900,0:05:09.960
Be released from hurt - deep hurt, in Jesus' name!

0:05:09.960,0:05:11.660
Rejoice.
