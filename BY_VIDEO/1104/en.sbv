0:00:08.780,0:00:12.140
Some people say, "Why care?"

0:00:12.140,0:00:15.860
They feel like it's a losing battle in these neighborhoods.

0:00:15.860,0:00:19.900
And my response is, "Why not care?

0:00:19.900,0:00:23.860
If we don't do something, nothing will change!"

0:00:23.860,0:00:31.420
It's like T.B. Joshua says, "The reason why we do good is to change the bad that we see".

0:00:31.420,0:00:35.700
So these youth that we're reaching with absentee parents,

0:00:35.700,0:00:41.920
if they weren't being reached, these are the same ones that we'll be doing home invasions.

0:00:41.920,0:00:47.620
These are the same ones that will be school shooters, shooting up our schools.

0:00:47.620,0:00:52.040
These are the same ones that will be committing homicide.

0:00:52.040,0:00:54.440
And what else would you expect?

0:00:54.440,0:01:01.520
Living in hostile, drug infested environments, with no guidance.

0:01:01.520,0:01:04.560
It's a recipe for destruction.

0:01:04.560,0:01:13.040
So without great people like T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners and their support,

0:01:13.040,0:01:19.620
it's no doubt that these youths would be lost.

0:01:19.620,0:01:26.760
Because many of them already feel like, if my parents don't care, then who cares?

0:01:26.760,0:01:32.920
They feel like, if my parents don't want me, then who wants me?

0:01:32.920,0:01:39.880
And since everyone has a part to play, our part is to use every good thing

0:01:39.880,0:01:42.680
to reroute them from the drugs,

0:01:42.680,0:01:45.380
to reroute them from the crime,

0:01:45.380,0:01:49.480
to reroute them from these destructive paths.

0:01:49.480,0:01:57.660
The avenues and the tools that we use to do this is mentoring, being big brothers to them.

0:01:57.660,0:02:02.400
Many of them like sports. So we use basketball.

0:02:02.400,0:02:05.280
When we coach them and train them,

0:02:05.280,0:02:10.360
we teach them integrity, we teach them character,

0:02:10.360,0:02:15.800
we teach them identity, we teach on right choices,

0:02:15.800,0:02:20.480
we also teach them principles from T.B. Joshua's book ''The Mirror' -

0:02:20.480,0:02:25.200
the principles we teach them, showing them who they were,

0:02:25.200,0:02:32.340
who they are and who they shall be.

0:02:32.340,0:02:37.160
And now, they can no longer just apply it on the court,

0:02:37.160,0:02:42.600
but they can apply it off the court, in real life also.

0:02:42.600,0:02:48.500
STRAIGHT OUTTA Emmanuel TV

0:02:48.500,0:02:52.300
I was born and raised in Defiance, Ohio.

0:02:52.300,0:02:56.140
When I was 3, my father died in a semi accident.

0:02:56.140,0:03:01.260
He was hit by a semi truck, coming home from work one night.

0:03:01.260,0:03:06.840
After that, there was a lot of hardship and a lot of struggle.

0:03:06.840,0:03:10.080
There were days we didn't have food; we didn't know if we were going to eat or not.

0:03:10.080,0:03:16.740
In 4th grade, the teachers told my mum that I was too hyper and that I needed to be on medication.

0:03:16.740,0:03:19.160
So then I was put on medication.

0:03:19.160,0:03:26.160
As the years went on, even though I was taking medication, I was still depressed.

0:03:26.160,0:03:28.240
I started drinking.

0:03:28.240,0:03:30.920
I started doing drugs.

0:03:30.920,0:03:35.160
And then fast forward, after college,

0:03:35.160,0:03:38.160
a few months after I graduated, I tried to take my life.

0:03:38.160,0:03:40.860
I took a bottle and a half of pills.

0:03:40.860,0:03:45.460
One night, I was just feeling so low, so broken.

0:03:45.460,0:03:49.600
My girlfriend at the time had just broken up with me.

0:03:49.600,0:03:53.820
I had just lost my job. I was just feeling so low.

0:03:53.820,0:03:59.540
I just felt like there was no reason for me to be alive.

0:03:59.540,0:04:08.600
So I took a bottle and a half of pills and drank a bunch of alcohol.

0:04:08.600,0:04:11.480
Then I drove to my friend's house.

0:04:11.480,0:04:13.980
I don't even remember driving there.

0:04:13.980,0:04:17.780
It was a miracle that I even made it to my friend's house.

0:04:17.780,0:04:22.900
But in the middle of the night, I woke up and remembered that I had taken those pills

0:04:22.900,0:04:27.320
and I tried to stand up, go to the bathroom and try to throw the pills up.

0:04:27.320,0:04:31.280
But my legs were numb from all the effects of the medication.

0:04:31.280,0:04:36.100
I couldn't stand up so I had to crawl to the bathroom.

0:04:36.100,0:04:41.960
When I got to the bathroom, I tried to throw the pills up and that's the last thing I remember.

0:04:41.960,0:04:53.060
I blacked out and went into a seizure.

0:04:53.060,0:04:58.800
The next thing I know is that I woke up in the emergency room, and I literally thought it was a dream.

0:04:58.800,0:05:02.600
After I got out of the hospital, things were still...

0:05:02.600,0:05:05.840
I was still drinking, I was still depressed.

0:05:05.840,0:05:11.620
Then I met an evangelist from The SCOAN

0:05:11.620,0:05:18.600
and she gave me a bottle of the New Morning Water by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:05:18.600,0:05:23.840
When I got home, I began to administer it to myself,

0:05:23.840,0:05:28.200
began to apply it to myself every day,

0:05:28.200,0:05:32.000
believing in God for healing, believing in God for deliverance.

0:05:32.000,0:05:37.340
And I got that healing. A couple of months later, I was able to throw the pills completely out.

0:05:37.340,0:05:40.680
It's been almost six years now that I've taken medication.

0:05:40.680,0:05:42.360
I feel free. I feel good.

0:05:42.360,0:05:45.720
I used to be depressed, I used to be suicidal.

0:05:45.720,0:05:50.540
Now I work full-time for the Emmanuel TV USA team.

0:05:50.540,0:05:57.520
We work with all kinds of kids that grow up in hardship, just like I did.

0:05:57.520,0:06:04.440
We feed the homeless, we help the elderly, we do all kinds of great things.

0:06:04.440,0:06:10.920
I am just so thankful and grateful that God used Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:06:10.920,0:06:15.020
to bring the New Morning Water into my life and healed me and delivered me.

0:06:15.020,0:06:19.580
If God can do it for me, He can do it for you.

0:06:26.400,0:06:30.480
I used to think, it was so hard to reach kids.

0:06:30.480,0:06:35.080
But I found out something - love is the key.

0:06:35.080,0:06:41.860
Just like T.B. Joshua says," Let love lead".

0:06:41.860,0:06:46.580
And that's what we are doing - we are going into these neighborhoods, we feed them,

0:06:46.580,0:06:52.620
we give them Emmanuel TV backpacks and build relationships with them.

0:06:52.620,0:06:59.900
We are even developing Emmanuel TV basketball teams.

0:06:59.900,0:07:04.140
Giving them a way out - away from the drugs and the crime.

0:08:13.640,0:08:18.680
THE EMMANUEL TV OFFICE USA

0:08:18.680,0:08:26.280
So it's 1:30 am, and we're here, at the Emmanuel TV office in the USA.

0:08:26.280,0:08:28.940
Chris, what's the inventory on the shoes?

0:08:28.940,0:08:37.700
Okay, according to the list, we have 125 pairs for the guys and the girls.

0:08:37.700,0:08:44.520
The Emmanuel TV team is arranging, they're preparing to load in

0:08:44.520,0:08:53.720
because we have to drive three and a half to four hours away to the Gibault Children Facility in Indiana.

0:08:53.720,0:08:56.820
And we have so many items that we're taking for them there.

0:08:56.820,0:10:11.120
We're taking shoes, pants and shorts.

0:10:11.120,0:10:42.800
We have shoes for them as well.

0:10:42.800,0:11:10.080
For the young ladies, we have dresses.

0:11:10.080,0:11:21.680
We have a whole load of shirts.

0:11:21.680,0:11:37.620
We have hats.

0:11:37.620,0:11:50.660
We have glasses.

0:11:50.660,0:11:56.720
We have a whole load of hygiene products for them,

0:11:56.720,0:12:03.040
as well as we do at Emmanuel TV resource office.

0:12:03.040,0:12:07.560
The reason why we're doing this is to change their lives.

0:12:07.560,0:12:12.900
Many of them are, as we said before, they're from ages 6,

0:12:12.900,0:12:15.460
some of them are in their teens.

0:12:15.460,0:12:18.340
However, unless something changes,

0:12:18.340,0:12:23.500
they will be there in this facility until they're 21 years of age.

0:12:23.500,0:12:27.620
So remember, many of them don't have any involvement with family

0:12:27.620,0:12:30.880
and so we're doing this so that we might be their family,

0:12:30.880,0:12:36.940
so that we can be an extension of their families and just be there for them.

0:12:36.940,0:12:41.880
We've got to remember like T.B. Joshua says, "In a world that cares less,

0:12:41.880,0:12:47.300
we have to care more and everyone has something to give".

0:12:47.300,0:12:50.200
Everyone can do something.

0:12:50.200,0:12:56.480
Everyone - even if it's a smile, you may just loan someone your strength who's weaker than you.

0:12:56.480,0:13:00.080
All of us has something to give.

0:13:00.080,0:13:03.760
We're looking forward to having a great event

0:13:03.760,0:13:06.400
and we're going to carry you along.

INDIANAPOLIS, IN

0:13:15.740,0:13:18.740
It's always good to have a team.

0:13:18.740,0:13:21.020
Even if it's a small team.

0:13:21.020,0:13:24.080
Because no one can do it alone!

0:13:24.080,0:13:29.660
Especially when driving is involved, this late at night or early morning.

0:13:29.660,0:13:36.460
Multiple vehicles going from one state to another state, four hours away.

0:13:36.460,0:13:41.560
Having a team is great because one can drive while the other rests

0:13:41.560,0:13:46.020
and you always got to factor in natural challenges.

0:13:46.020,0:13:52.460
And so for us driving from Ohio to Indiana and the Gibault Children Facility,

0:13:52.460,0:14:00.900
our challenge was the weather, because of the season - transitioning from winter to spring.

0:14:00.900,0:14:04.280
So it was a lot of rain.

0:14:04.280,0:14:08.080
However, we stayed the course.

0:14:23.880,0:14:27.340
One reason why we're doing this charity event today

0:14:27.340,0:14:32.920
is because of what took place the last time we were at the Gibault Facility.

0:14:32.920,0:14:37.680
If you find something that you do very well, it's an indication of who you are.

0:14:37.680,0:14:39.840
What about you?

0:14:39.840,0:14:47.080
When I was in my other school, I used to go around to other classrooms with my teacher

0:14:47.080,0:14:52.040
and help other kids solve problems.

0:14:52.040,0:14:54.660
Wow, we can already tell you are a leader.

0:14:54.660,0:14:56.120
Right?

0:14:56.120,0:15:00.520
The first thing that you said you love to do is help people with their what?

0:15:00.520,0:15:01.440
Problems.

0:15:01.440,0:15:04.880
Helping them with their problems. Wow, that's amazing.

0:15:04.880,0:15:07.720
So can you tell me, because I can look

0:15:07.720,0:15:10.960
and tell by the things that you're saying what type of person you are.

0:15:10.960,0:15:11.960
So who are you?

0:15:11.960,0:15:13.140
I'm a leader.

0:15:13.140,0:15:14.860
You're leader. Definitely, you're a leader.

0:15:14.860,0:15:15.780
I'm an encourager.

0:15:15.780,0:15:17.360
Yes.

0:15:17.360,0:15:18.900
I want to be a therapist.

0:15:18.900,0:15:20.740
There you go.

0:15:20.740,0:15:27.660
And as I spoke with these youths, even though many were medicated and had issues,

0:15:27.660,0:15:34.160
when I spoke with them, I realized this: They had a lot of potential.

GIBAULT FACILITIES
INDIANA, USA

0:16:03.640,0:16:08.880
One of the directors was giving us a tour and we came across one of the students in the hallway,

0:16:08.880,0:16:12.640
who was just too hyper to be in class at the moment

0:16:12.640,0:16:17.260
and the director told us that the student is normally very violent.

0:16:17.260,0:16:20.200
But when we approached him,

0:16:20.200,0:16:25.440
he just wanted to talk about music and he was very respectful.

0:16:25.440,0:16:28.740
I think Tupac is still alive, you know that?

0:16:28.740,0:16:31.860
And I can go on for weeks. I've got a lot of research on Tupac.

0:16:31.860,0:16:32.460
You do?

0:16:32.460,0:16:33.020
Yeah.

0:16:33.020,0:16:35.100
Hey Logan, let them do what they need to do.

0:16:35.100,0:16:36.680
They are doing what they got to do.

0:16:36.680,0:16:38.200
- Logan, how old are you?
- Huh?

0:16:38.200,0:16:39.440
- How old are you?
- I'm 16.

0:16:39.440,0:16:40.820
- Are you?
- Yeah.

0:16:40.820,0:16:42.640
- How are you?
- Hi, I'm Diane. How are you?

0:16:42.640,0:16:44.100
Good, good.

0:16:44.100,0:16:50.020
And the interesting thing about it is, he's one of the smartest students in the whole campus.

0:16:50.020,0:16:53.780
He's one of my favourite kids, too.

0:16:53.780,0:16:56.640
He can't just get it together sometimes.

0:16:56.640,0:17:02.460
(Inaudible)

0:17:02.460,0:17:06.780
He's actually one of the smartest students we have.

0:17:06.780,0:17:12.800
All these kids need is family.

0:17:12.800,0:17:16.420
They need somebody that cares to be in their lives.

First of all, I would like to say that the Gibault Children Facility is doing a great job.

0:18:03.720,0:18:07.660
They're doing a tremendous job, but it doesn't stop there.

0:18:07.660,0:18:13.000
It's going to take other organizations and other people to help raise these youth

0:18:13.000,0:18:19.340
and that's why I'm glad that Emmanuel TV is a part of that in raising these youth.

0:18:19.340,0:18:22.760
Because even though Gibault is doing a great job,

0:18:22.760,0:18:29.320
it's still evident that these youths are hurt and many of them are traumatized in many ways.

0:18:29.320,0:18:31.340
There is a reason why we are here.

0:18:31.340,0:18:34.620
There is a reason why we are breathing.

0:18:34.620,0:18:36.500
- Do you know what it is?
- No.

0:18:36.500,0:18:37.200
Ok, what about you?

0:18:37.200,0:18:40.340
Supposedly,  God gave us a reason to be here. I don't know why.

0:18:40.340,0:18:42.540
Let me tell you something. Yes, for each and everyone of us.

0:18:42.540,0:18:46.620
I mea,n I went through a lot hurt in my life, so technically I don't think I should be alive.

0:18:46.620,0:18:51.580
Plus, my real mum called me a "Walking A**hole" because I was a walking A**hole.

0:18:51.580,0:18:54.460
Ok, I hear what you're saying, but understand this right here.

0:18:54.460,0:18:58.960
There is something good about you and there is a purpose for everything.

0:18:58.960,0:19:02.440
There is a purpose for an apple, what is that?

0:19:02.440,0:19:04.400
For you to eat an apple.

0:19:04.400,0:19:08.820
Exactly, there's something great about you, there's something on the inside of you that is unique,

0:19:08.820,0:19:11.140
that is different from everybody else.

0:19:11.140,0:19:13.080
Also understand this right here:

0:19:13.080,0:19:19.420
A lot of times, when we are lost in life, it's simply because we don't know the address for our future.

0:19:19.420,0:19:22.160
A lot of times, if we don't understand the greatness that's within us,

0:19:22.160,0:19:26.820
each and every one of us has something to contribute to society.

0:19:26.820,0:19:30.260
Regardless of what you have been through, regardless of what you're going through.

0:19:30.260,0:19:32.640
There's something great about each and every one of you.

0:19:32.640,0:19:35.080
There's something unique about each and every one of you.

0:19:35.080,0:19:38.800
If they're traumatized in many ways, it's going to play out in their lives,

0:19:38.800,0:19:44.460
and that's what's happening and many of them get their identity from the music,

0:19:44.460,0:19:51.320
from media and so forth, especially with not having that family involvement.

0:19:51.320,0:19:57.540
But we've got to be able to continue to reach them on whatever level and communicate with them

0:19:57.540,0:20:01.080
and make them feel important in society.

So as we were doing this charity event, the local news got wind of it and they came out and covered it.

0:20:13.080,0:20:19.420
And just like many other people when they see the great things going on, "Wow, this is great!

0:20:19.420,0:20:26.380
Who are you?" And like I often tell people, "I am just an extra set of hands and extra set of feet

0:20:26.380,0:20:29.600
that is on the ground to help get the resources to people".

0:20:29.600,0:20:32.340
But it's not really me. I'm not the one that's really doing it.

0:20:32.340,0:20:35.120
It really comes from T.B. Joshua.

0:20:35.120,0:20:37.700
It really comes from the Emanuel TV partners.

0:20:37.700,0:20:41.600
Don't just stand by and watch.

0:20:41.600,0:20:43.840
The generation of today goes by the waste side.

0:20:43.840,0:20:48.140
We can change the bad that we see by doing good.

0:20:52.340,0:20:57.720
They're just amazed by everything that's going on and see we come from a time where

0:20:57.720,0:21:03.040
America used to go all over the world and take resources and relief

0:21:03.040,0:21:06.700
and now America is in need and the roles have change.

0:21:06.700,0:21:13.820
Now, you have great humanitarians like T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV

0:21:13.820,0:21:18.460
come in and send in the resources so that we can get to the need to the people.

0:21:18.460,0:21:25.580
He's someone that believes that distance isn't a barrier, that regardless of where you are,

0:21:25.580,0:21:30.000
we should be able to get the needs to the people.

0:22:37.040,0:22:40.400
During our visit at the Gibault Children's Home,

0:22:40.400,0:22:43.980
we came across a classroom with nothing but little children

0:22:43.980,0:22:49.480
and I thought to myself I can't imagine  being six years old with no parents around.

0:22:49.480,0:22:53.620
trying to figure out life on my own.

0:22:53.620,0:23:00.380
That's why it's such a blessing that T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners,

0:23:00.380,0:23:07.800
all across the world, are providing resources so that we can bless these kids.

0:23:07.800,0:23:12.640
Everything that's been done, everything that's been provided

0:23:12.640,0:23:17.540
is making a change and making a difference in these kids' lives.

0:23:17.540,0:23:20.680
- Hi, how are you?

0:23:20.680,0:23:22.120
- I love the Pacers.

0:23:22.120,0:23:23.640
- You love the Pacers?
- Yeah.

0:23:23.640,0:23:25.000
- There we go.

0:23:25.000,0:23:28.080
- You're like a little engineer over here, you like making airplanes?

0:23:28.080,0:23:29.620
- High five. 
- High five, man!

0:23:29.620,0:23:32.960
- Snail, I mean turkey.

0:23:32.960,0:23:34.000
- Snail!

0:23:34.000,0:23:36.800
- Do you want to see how many airplanes I have?
- Sure.

0:23:36.800,0:23:38.900
- I made them all.
- Wow, you did?

The director gave us a tour of some of the dorm rooms

0:24:15.820,0:24:20.240
and as you can see, some of the rooms only had one bed.

0:24:20.240,0:24:25.060
Those rooms with one bed are for those students that tend to be violent.

0:24:25.060,0:24:30.460
A lot of them are violent because that's the only way they know how to deal with their problems.

0:24:30.460,0:24:36.840
And those rooms with two beds, well, they are able to get along with their fellow students.

0:24:36.840,0:24:42.160
We also ran into this kid that occupied a room with one bed.

0:24:42.160,0:24:44.580
He was known to be a violent guy.

0:24:44.580,0:24:48.820
But once again, we're talking with him in reference to his dream.

0:24:48.820,0:24:54.360
He relayed to us that his dream is to be a pilot in the Air Force.

0:24:54.360,0:24:58.280
We began going through these classrooms and interacting with the children.

0:24:58.280,0:25:05.960
I noticed that a lot of these young ladies were brilliant in their own right!

0:25:05.960,0:25:11.160
But because of the lack of family involvement, many of them were medicated,

0:25:11.160,0:25:13.980
just to cope with life and that was me.

0:25:13.980,0:25:22.000
I used to be heavily medicated, just to deal with one day to the next.

0:25:22.000,0:25:26.640
But now, it's such a blessing to be able to work with Emmanuel TV

0:25:26.640,0:25:30.280
and just change the lives of these kids.

0:26:43.280,0:26:47.240
''Class Piggy Bank'' is where I just started.

Like TB Joshua says, "Your dream is a photograph of your future

0:27:10.100,0:27:15.140
and when your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning".

0:27:15.140,0:27:19.620
So this is the message that we are spreading to all of these youths.

0:27:19.620,0:27:23.900
We have got a Veterinarian here.

0:27:23.900,0:27:25.420
Hi guys!

0:27:25.420,0:27:31.400
As you can see, the Emmanuel TV team has prepared a pizza party at the youths' request.

0:27:31.400,0:27:36.060
Previously, we were preparing a dinner for hundred youth,

0:27:36.060,0:27:42.940
but when we arrived for the charity event, to our surprise, Gibault had gained 45 more youth

0:27:42.940,0:27:47.400
and the majority of youth asked if we could have a pizza party instead.

0:27:47.400,0:27:54.560
So, we ordered pizza, salad and soda from the best pizza restaurant in town.

I think it's great. I think there's a need in young people,

0:38:00.180,0:38:04.900
especially those who aren't given their needs as young kids.

0:38:04.900,0:38:08.080
Gibault is a place where they can have those needs fulfilled

0:38:08.080,0:38:10.680
and we have outside people come in, outside influences.

0:38:10.680,0:38:12.340
That only makes people stronger and better.

0:38:12.340,0:38:15.920
That's what these young people need at this age.

0:38:15.920,0:38:18.880
Your very experience - just tell us your position and stuff.

0:38:18.880,0:38:21.740
I'm a police officer. I'm the spokesperson for the police department.

0:38:21.740,0:38:24.100
I travel with groups and speak to groups all the time.

0:38:24.100,0:38:26.560
I see it - there is a need.

0:38:26.560,0:38:30.360
It takes a certain person to fulfill that need because not everybody can do it.

0:38:30.360,0:38:37.940
It is not an easy job to do but it's important so we are thankful for people willing to do it.

0:38:37.940,0:38:39.460
Keith.

0:38:39.460,0:38:44.220
I would first like to thank you for coming all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio.

0:38:44.220,0:38:48.220
I know you guys are all around the world but to take the time to come to Terre Haute, Indiana

0:38:48.220,0:38:50.940
and to work with our children in...

0:38:50.940,0:38:55.600
We don't realize how important it is for kids in a residential treatment facility

0:38:55.600,0:38:57.220
to have someone come to their house.

0:38:57.220,0:39:02.180
This is their house; they don't get to go home. They are here 24/7.

0:39:02.180,0:39:06.000
So for someone to come to their house and bring them gifts like this...

0:39:06.000,0:39:09.980
As a parent, I am always taking things home to my kids.

0:39:09.980,0:39:14.260
You guys are basically an extension of our family and we appreciate it

0:39:14.260,0:39:18.000
because it takes a community to really raise a kid.

0:39:18.000,0:39:21.440
You are a part of our community now, We appreciate all you have done.

0:39:21.440,0:39:22.380
Thank you all.

0:39:29.700,0:39:32.060
Exactly what they said.

0:39:32.060,0:39:34.420
It's a great thing to see these kids with smiles on their faces

0:39:34.420,0:39:38.060
as they open up something they know they couldn't have where they were coming from.

0:39:38.060,0:39:40.540
They have to stay here 365 days, 7 days a week.

0:39:40.540,0:39:43.760
Where they were coming from, they know they were not privileged enough to have

0:39:43.760,0:39:49.180
Jordans, Uggs, hats, tabogans or anything else like that so you all are...

0:39:49.180,0:39:54.040
We cannot express how much we like you guys and how much we want you guys to be part of our family.

0:39:54.040,0:39:57.340
Thank you for all of your help.

0:39:57.340,0:40:00.900
Emmanuel TV - thank you!
