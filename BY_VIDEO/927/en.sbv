Anointing is the power of God; anointing is in the house.

0:00:04.880,0:00:11.040
I say, anointing is in the house.

0:00:11.040,0:00:16.540
All you need to do is to put your demand by faith on the anointing.

0:00:16.540,0:00:20.620
You are a faith man; you are a faith woman.

0:00:20.620,0:00:26.660
The right hand of God is power.

0:00:26.660,0:00:28.400
Listen once again.

0:00:28.400,0:00:34.640
Grudge has created a room for depression.

0:00:34.640,0:00:41.940
Whatever you are facing is a result of a grudge you are holding against your fellow man.

0:00:41.940,0:00:56.260
Grudge, pain of the past, unforgiveness - whether you are right or wrong .

0:00:56.260,0:01:01.520
please, put everything behind you; they are your adverts.

0:01:01.520,0:01:05.200
How will you be known, if people are not talking about you?

0:01:05.200,0:01:09.140
The same mouth will praise - the same mouth will condemn.

0:01:09.140,0:01:15.620
This mouth cannot say one thing; it will condemn and it will praise.

0:01:15.620,0:01:22.700
If you are expecting people to praise you, you should expect people to condemn you.

0:01:22.700,0:01:27.880
Whatever pain, whatever happened in the past, please put it behind you, move forward.

0:01:27.880,0:01:32.720
All these are adverts.

0:01:32.720,0:01:37.860
You will soon be known all over the world.

0:01:37.860,0:01:40.820
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:01:40.820,0:01:43.960
In the name of Jesus!

0:01:43.960,0:01:47.480
Right now, put your demand on the anointing.

0:01:47.480,0:01:55.000
The right hand of God is power.

0:01:55.000,0:02:05.560
Let the power of God come down.

0:02:05.560,0:02:21.360
Let the power of the Lord come down

0:02:21.360,0:02:40.640
Let the power of the Lord from Heaven come down
Let the power of the Lord come down

0:02:40.640,0:03:03.600
You demon, in all places in your life,

0:03:03.600,0:03:07.880
begin to command them out, in the name of Jesus.

0:03:07.880,0:03:47.540
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:03:47.540,0:03:52.060
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:03:52.060,0:03:59.880
You demon, listen to the voice of my people; I command you right now to leave my people!

0:03:59.880,0:04:03.160
I command you to leave my people!

0:04:03.160,0:04:06.100
Leave my people!

0:04:06.100,0:04:19.080
In the name of Jesus, leave my people!

0:04:19.080,0:04:23.580
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:04:23.580,0:04:26.960
In the mighty name of Jesus.

0:04:26.960,0:04:32.020
Look, there are many things we need to observe when we are praying.

0:04:32.020,0:04:40.920
When you pray, wait; you talk - let God talk.

0:04:40.920,0:04:46.240
You pause and wait; let God talk.

0:04:46.240,0:04:50.920
When you continue to pray, you are not allowing God to reply you.

0:04:50.920,0:04:53.400
We are not allowing God. When you are praying -

0:04:53.400,0:04:58.000
we are praying: "Leave my people, in Jesus' name, amen!" - you pause.

0:04:58.000,0:05:00.700
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:05:00.700,0:05:05.140
You wait to see what God is about to do.

0:05:05.140,0:05:09.320
But we don't wait. Even in our home, we continue to pray, pray -

0:05:09.320,0:05:11.500
you are not waiting for God to talk to you.

0:05:11.500,0:05:14.760
You talk - God talks.

0:05:14.760,0:05:18.740
But it's one-sided - your prayer.

0:05:18.740,0:05:22.220
When you pray, I will join you in prayer. I say, "Ok, prayer", we pray.

0:05:22.220,0:05:27.940
When I now come in to say, "Hey, you demon, leave my people, in the name of Jesus!",

0:05:27.940,0:05:30.360
you say, "Amen!"; you pause.

0:05:30.360,0:05:38.480
You will see me pause. I will remain silent to see what God is about to do, how much God hears me.

0:05:38.480,0:05:44.600
But you will not wait to hear from God, you just... - your own is one way.

0:05:44.600,0:05:51.540
Just one way. If God talks, you don't want to listen. Your own is your own.

0:05:51.540,0:05:53.580
You have to pause. Can you see now?

0:05:53.580,0:05:57.820
It affects the response of God, if you don't allow Him to talk.

0:05:57.820,0:05:59.640
It really affects the response.

0:05:59.640,0:06:03.460
When you talk and you allow, you pause, wait to see -

0:06:03.460,0:06:09.720
while you are waiting, in your spirit you continue to say, "Thank You, God, for what You are about to do."

0:06:09.720,0:06:12.320
He manifests Himself.

0:06:12.320,0:06:18.820
But when you don't wait for Him to talk, to reply, to respond to what you are asking for

0:06:18.820,0:06:24.140
and you continue to talk, it affects Him; He will just, "Ok, continue talking.

0:06:24.140,0:06:27.140
When you get tired, you can go home".

0:06:27.140,0:06:29.800
If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.

0:06:29.800,0:06:34.740
Viewers at home, viewers all over the world, I hope you understand what I am saying.

0:06:34.740,0:06:40.120
When you are praying on your own, after praying, you pause, you remain silent.

0:06:40.120,0:06:44.280
In your heart you say, "Thank You, Lord!" It means you are expecting Him to respond.

0:06:44.280,0:06:46.160
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:06:46.160,0:06:50.980
Assume you have been doing this, you would suddenly see yourself falling down.

0:06:50.980,0:06:52.780
If I am talking to mama now...

0:06:52.780,0:06:54.560
How are you, mum?

0:06:54.560,0:06:56.060
I am fine. Thanks.

0:06:56.060,0:06:59.320
If I say, "How are you?", you will say, "Fine."

0:06:59.320,0:07:02.240
But I'm not even waiting for her to respond.

0:07:02.240,0:07:06.920
How are you?

0:07:06.920,0:07:08.240
Oh my God.

0:07:08.240,0:07:13.300
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:07:13.300,0:07:23.640
Or I now say... It's God, I say, "Give me bread!"

0:07:23.640,0:07:27.220
If I say, "Give me bread", I will wait for you to give me.

0:07:27.220,0:07:31.140
But we don't wait, we say, "Give me bread".

0:07:31.140,0:07:32.780
This is crazy.

0:07:32.780,0:07:39.180
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:07:39.180,0:07:42.740
God's response is very important.

0:07:42.740,0:07:50.140
It is because we don't trust ourselves, we see prayer as conventional, in a traditional way -

0:07:50.140,0:07:53.760
we just have to pray because we are asked to pray.

0:07:53.760,0:07:59.780
If you really know you are talking to somebody, you should expect that somebody to reply.

0:07:59.780,0:08:06.020
If you know you are talking to somebody, you should also pause for the response of that person.

0:08:06.020,0:08:14.120
But in this case, you don't even believe you are talking to somebody - that is why we talk, talk, talk.

0:08:14.120,0:08:19.000
We are talking to someone, somebody in the person of the Holy Ghost.

0:08:19.000,0:08:24.200
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:08:24.200,0:08:27.700
God's response. Let someone say: "God's response."

0:08:27.700,0:08:28.960
I can't hear you.

0:08:28.960,0:08:30.240
[God's response.]

0:08:30.240,0:08:31.160
I can't hear you.

0:08:31.160,0:08:32.320
[God's response.]

0:08:32.320,0:08:34.300
God's response must be noted.

0:08:34.300,0:08:39.740
When you say a word, you must wait for His response in the same moment.

0:08:39.740,0:08:44.040
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:44.040,0:09:04.460
