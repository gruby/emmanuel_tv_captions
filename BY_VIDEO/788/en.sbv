0:00:00.000,0:00:02.140
Good morning everybody.

0:00:02.140,0:00:04.060
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:04.060,0:00:06.820
My name is Titilola Siphiwe Labode.

0:00:06.820,0:00:11.160
I'm from Zimbabwe. I'm half Nigerian and half Zimbabwean.

0:00:11.160,0:00:17.020
The woman beside me is my mother, Honourable Doctor Ruth Labode from Zimbabwe as well.

0:00:17.020,0:00:22.000
I will start my testimony with the crisis.

0:00:22.000,0:00:26.860
I went to university in England in 2004.

0:00:26.860,0:00:31.000
I picked up certain habits that affected me.

0:00:31.000,0:00:35.460
These habits included smoking and drinking.

0:00:35.460,0:00:40.940
I used to smoke and drink for eight years.

0:00:40.940,0:00:46.980
It was quite bad as it wasn't one or two cigarettes a day. I used to smoke twenty cigarettes a day.

0:00:46.980,0:00:54.220
My parents used to send me money for my tuition, my accommodation and my welfare.

0:00:54.220,0:00:58.120
They never wanted me to have a job while I was studying.

0:00:58.120,0:01:01.380
They wanted me to complete my studies without working.

0:01:01.380,0:01:07.920
But because my smoking and drinking habits were quite expensive in the UK,

0:01:07.920,0:01:16.980
I secretly got myself a job to support my drinking and smoking habits.

0:01:16.980,0:01:23.780
It was really bad because I passed with a 2.2 degree in BSc Accounting

0:01:23.780,0:01:27.060
but I spent most of my time out.

0:01:27.060,0:01:32.460
I would go out everyday. I would be in the club smoking and drinking.

0:01:32.460,0:01:36.520
It was just by the grace of God that nothing bad happened to me.

0:01:36.520,0:01:40.340
But I wasn't in good health.

0:01:40.340,0:01:43.720
I was very skinny and had bad skin.

0:01:43.720,0:01:46.540
I just wasn't healthy.

0:01:46.540,0:01:51.840
After a while, my parents begged me to come back home to Zimbabwe.

0:01:51.840,0:01:56.640
I used to refuse, saying that I was fine. I was ok in England -

0:01:56.640,0:01:59.700
working and being independent.

0:01:59.700,0:02:05.240
The people that I surrounded myself with were also smokers and drinkers.

0:02:05.240,0:02:07.500
So to me it was a normal life.

0:02:07.500,0:02:09.660
I would say that this is normal life here.

0:02:09.660,0:02:11.780
You are just in Africa and backwards.

0:02:11.780,0:02:13.580
You don't understand.

0:02:13.580,0:02:24.180
Eventually my mom and dad convinced me to move back to Zimbabwe where I grew up.

0:02:24.180,0:02:29.180
They brought me to The SCOAN in June 2014.

0:02:29.180,0:02:32.860
When I came to The SCOAN, I was placed in the prayer line.

0:02:32.860,0:02:36.320
I received Morning Water and was also blessed.

0:02:36.320,0:02:40.320
The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua laid his hand on me.

0:02:40.320,0:02:43.260
When he laid his hand on me,

0:02:43.260,0:02:47.400
I felt this electricity going through my body.

0:02:47.400,0:02:52.900
Then after that, he didn't touch me. He just moved his hand and I fell on the floor.

0:02:52.900,0:02:55.880
I was conviced that someone had pulled me down.

0:02:55.880,0:02:58.480
Because afterwards I went to my mom and said,

0:02:58.480,0:03:00.960
"Mom, somebody pulled me down so that I could fall".

0:03:00.960,0:03:04.480
And then she said, "No, you were by yourself", although I was conviced otherwise.

0:03:04.480,0:03:09.140
But then when I was at home, I watched the video and saw that there was no one standing next me.

0:03:09.140,0:03:15.660
I went back home and tried to go back to my habit of smoking.

0:03:15.660,0:03:22.960
I was trying to force the issue because to me it was cool to be having a cigarette and a drink when being out.

0:03:22.960,0:03:26.620
But when I started smoking, I started feeling sick.

0:03:26.620,0:03:31.700
I would feel like I had a lot of phlegm and mucus in my throat.

0:03:31.700,0:03:35.340
I would feel tired and dizzy.

0:03:35.340,0:03:37.840
It just wasn't going well with my body anymore.

0:03:37.840,0:03:44.080
So eventually, I started cutting down and then stopped smoking.

0:03:44.080,0:03:48.080
Whilst I used to smoke, drink and go out in England,

0:03:48.080,0:03:50.380
I used to have a lot of bad dreams.

0:03:50.380,0:03:52.080
I would dream of snakes.

0:03:52.080,0:03:57.220
I would dream of having intercourse.

0:03:57.220,0:04:04.280
I would have bad dreams, dreaming of scorpions, spiders and all sorts.

0:04:04.280,0:04:12.400
After my deliverance at The SCOAN, I had a dream about Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:04:12.400,0:04:14.260
He actually came to me in the dream.

0:04:14.260,0:04:16.680
I was holding a cigarette in my hand like this.

0:04:16.680,0:04:22.100
He came to me and pulled it out of my mouth and broke it in half.

0:04:22.100,0:04:28.480
I believe that that was where my deliverance started, from that dream where he actually visited me.

0:04:28.480,0:04:34.360
I want to give glory to the Lord because I am now a new creation in Christ and I am much healthier and happier.

0:04:34.360,0:04:35.600
Hallelujah.

0:04:35.600,0:04:38.400
Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:04:38.400,0:04:41.560
Before when I would try to stop smoking on my own,

0:04:41.560,0:04:44.060
I would stop for three months.

0:04:44.060,0:04:49.900
But then if someone was smoking in front of me, I would follow them and inhale the smoke

0:04:49.900,0:04:51.880
because I would be craving for it.

0:04:51.880,0:04:55.200
It would be the same with drinking as I would try to stop drinking

0:04:55.200,0:04:58.340
but I would then secretly buy myself a bottle of wine and go to my room.

0:04:58.340,0:05:01.680
But then I was just deceiving myself because at the end of the day I was still drinking

0:05:01.680,0:05:03.420
and God knew that I was still drinking.

0:05:03.420,0:05:05.840
But after the man of God touched me,

0:05:05.840,0:05:13.120
even if someone would smoke next to me, I would actually move away as it is now like poison to me.

0:05:13.120,0:05:14.960
I don't want the smell of smoke next to me.

0:05:14.960,0:05:17.280
Even with alcohol, I no longer crave for it.

0:05:17.280,0:05:20.560
Before, I would crave for it and had to have a glass of red wine every day.

0:05:20.560,0:05:23.400
It was a must. My mouth just wouldn't feel right without it.

0:05:23.400,0:05:26.360
But now, I don't even think about alcohol.

0:05:26.360,0:05:28.480
I'm happy and fresh.

0:05:28.480,0:05:30.940
I'm a new creation.

0:05:30.940,0:05:33.460
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:05:33.460,0:05:36.660
Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:05:36.660,0:05:42.660
Now, we want you to paint a clearer picture of how bad the situation was

0:05:42.660,0:05:47.500
when you were having this addiction to smoking and drinking.

0:05:47.500,0:05:52.600
What are some of those terrible moments that you find difficult to forget

0:05:52.600,0:05:54.680
when you were having this problem?

0:05:54.680,0:05:59.000
I will give you a couple of experiences that I had that were very bad.

0:05:59.000,0:06:04.320
I was out with my friends and I got very drunk.

0:06:04.320,0:06:07.760
I started vomiting in public.

0:06:07.760,0:06:15.340
My friends wanted to stay out and didn't care about how I was feeling.

0:06:15.340,0:06:21.040
So I spent the night in the club toilet being sick and vomiting.

0:06:21.040,0:06:26.780
The last terrible experience I had was when I came back to Zimbabwe.

0:06:26.780,0:06:30.480
I came back with that lifestyle because I was from England.

0:06:30.480,0:06:32.560
I continued it in Zimbabwe.

0:06:32.560,0:06:38.740
I went out. I drank a lot. I smoked 20 cigarettes that night.

0:06:38.740,0:06:42.760
When I got home, I was so dizzy.

0:06:42.760,0:06:45.560
I couldn't walk.

0:06:45.560,0:06:49.400
The door of the car was opened and I came crawling out of my car.

0:06:49.400,0:06:59.480
We have dogs at home and the situation was so bad that they were crawling beside me to the front door.

0:06:59.480,0:07:05.360
That is where my mother was and she looked at me in disgust.

0:07:05.360,0:07:09.380
When I think about it now, I feel sad.

0:07:09.380,0:07:14.040
But at the time, I would be annoyed at her and think, "What is her problem?

0:07:14.040,0:07:18.260
This is how I have always lived my life. She can't just try and change me".

0:07:18.260,0:07:19.740
That was my attitude before.

0:07:19.740,0:07:24.260
I didn't understand why she was trying to stop me from what I wanted to do

0:07:24.260,0:07:26.380
because to me that was normal.

0:07:26.380,0:07:32.440
When I look back at it, I feel sad and it is heart breaking.

0:07:32.440,0:07:37.300
One wastes so much time and spends so much money on things that just destroy your body.

0:07:37.300,0:07:43.220
When the Lord God gives you life and gives you Jesus, it is all that you need.

0:07:43.220,0:07:45.200
So I'm just grateful.

0:07:45.200,0:07:47.420
Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:07:47.420,0:07:49.980
Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:07:49.980,0:07:53.680
You said that all this while you were smoking and drinking,

0:07:53.680,0:07:59.900
what were you doing and how were you able to source for money

0:07:59.900,0:08:03.180
in order to keep us these bad habits?

0:08:03.180,0:08:09.300
As I mentioned earlier, I went to England to study at university.

0:08:09.300,0:08:14.660
My parents did not want me to work but to rather focus on my studies.

0:08:14.660,0:08:18.880
But because of my habits, that they were not aware of,

0:08:18.880,0:08:23.220
I went and got a part-time job.

0:08:23.220,0:08:26.880
I was working in a call centre while I was at university.

0:08:26.880,0:08:32.180
I used the money that they sent me to buy cases of cigarettes.

0:08:32.180,0:08:36.100
Especially at the airport when returning from a visit to Zimbabwe where cigarettes are very cheap,

0:08:36.100,0:08:39.740
I would buy cases of cigarettes and my mom wouldn't know.

0:08:39.740,0:08:45.140
She had no idea. In Africa when a child is misbehaving like that,

0:08:45.140,0:08:47.180
it makes the parent look bad.

0:08:47.180,0:08:53.500
But I didn't care. I would be saying that this was my addiction, my habit and my right.

0:08:53.500,0:08:57.120
I would buy cases of cigarettes and when I got to England,

0:08:57.120,0:09:01.100
I would smoke Marlboro and Marlboro cigarettes are very expensive.

0:09:01.100,0:09:03.040
Those are the ones that I wanted.

0:09:03.040,0:09:05.580
It left me broke all the time.

0:09:05.580,0:09:08.220
My dad even gave me his credit card one time

0:09:08.220,0:09:12.940
because he thought he was being considerate to his daughter and he loves me.

0:09:12.940,0:09:18.640
But he didn't know that I was supporting my bad habit with his money.

0:09:18.640,0:09:21.040
And now all of this is over?

0:09:21.040,0:09:24.360
Yes, all things of the past. I have found God now so I'm happy.

0:09:24.360,0:09:26.720
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus one more time!

0:09:26.720,0:09:30.820
Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:09:30.820,0:09:38.740
This is me while at university on a night out with my friends.

0:09:38.740,0:09:44.620
If you look closely, you will see that I'm holding a cigarette in my hand.

0:09:44.620,0:09:50.180
That's us in the club. We were just having drinks and cigarettes.

0:09:50.180,0:09:53.080
Ok. Point to yourself in the picture.

0:09:53.080,0:09:54.440
That's me in the middle.

0:09:54.440,0:09:55.340
Ok.

0:09:55.340,0:09:57.060
Over there. That is a cigarette.

0:09:57.060,0:10:00.860
If I zoom in for you, you can see the cigarette in my hand.

0:10:00.860,0:10:01.980
Ok.

0:10:01.980,0:10:05.280
You can also see my friends having cigarettes. We were all smokers.

0:10:05.280,0:10:08.640
We were all into the same.

0:10:08.640,0:10:15.540
That is another picture of me at a house party in summer time in England.

0:10:15.540,0:10:17.540
Where are you in the picture?

0:10:17.540,0:10:20.320
I was at a place called Grimsby. That is me over there.

0:10:20.320,0:10:21.060
Wow.

0:10:21.060,0:10:25.880
That is me lying down, holding a cigarette yet again.

0:10:25.880,0:10:29.260
And you can see the box on my lap.

0:10:29.260,0:10:33.880
If you look closely on my lap, you can see a box of cigarettes there.

0:10:33.880,0:10:39.500
That was my habit, that was my life.

0:10:39.500,0:10:41.320
It wasn't good.

0:10:41.320,0:10:45.320
To God be the glory! Now old things have passed away, all things have become new, right?

0:10:45.320,0:10:45.900
Yes.

0:10:45.900,0:10:48.400
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:48.400,0:10:53.120
Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:10:53.120,0:10:57.820
As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says, "When Jesus Christ enters our life,

0:10:57.820,0:11:01.120
He puts an end to our past and gives birth to our future".

0:11:01.120,0:11:04.640
Today, we thank God Almighty for the life of our sister

0:11:04.640,0:11:08.680
who has been delivered from her past life of smoking and drinking

0:11:08.680,0:11:11.620
and now she is a new creation in Christ Jesus.

0:11:11.620,0:11:12.840
Old things have passed away.

0:11:12.840,0:11:13.960
Glory be to God in the highest!

0:11:13.960,0:11:16.120
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:11:16.120,0:11:23.220
By the grace of God, I am Honourable Doctor Ruth Labode,

0:11:23.220,0:11:26.660
a member of parliament in Zimbabwe.

0:11:26.660,0:11:30.220
I actually urged my daugher to give this testimony.

0:11:30.220,0:11:35.020
Not so much about her testimony but as a message to parents.

0:11:35.020,0:11:38.480
We work hard every day.

0:11:38.480,0:11:41.420
We chase money. We chase money like we are chasing the wind

0:11:41.420,0:11:45.940
because we want our children to live well.

0:11:45.940,0:11:50.180
We then send them abroad

0:11:50.180,0:11:56.040
without preparing them for the evil that is in the world.

0:11:56.040,0:11:59.220
We think because we can pay for the school fees

0:11:59.220,0:12:03.380
and the child passes the exams, that is it. That is not it.

0:12:03.380,0:12:08.960
When the child is not ready, the devil is waiting for the child somewhere in hell or in Liverpool.

0:12:08.960,0:12:12.700
The child is not prepared as the parents have not taken their child to God.

0:12:12.700,0:12:18.200
You have not taken your child to God because you yourself are a lukewarm Christian.

0:12:18.200,0:12:20.080
That is not important to you.

0:12:20.080,0:12:26.460
Yet, that is the most important thing and to prepare your child for what they will face in the world.

0:12:26.460,0:12:29.420
I believe it is wrong for us parents.

0:12:29.420,0:12:30.860
I know for sure.

0:12:30.860,0:12:35.400
What was important to me before was that my husband and I have paid the school fees.

0:12:35.400,0:12:37.640
Then we would phone and follow up on whether the child had passed the exams.

0:12:37.640,0:12:40.540
We didn't know that in the meantime the child was decaying.

0:12:40.540,0:12:43.940
The child was just dying a natural death in real life.

0:12:43.940,0:12:46.420
Yes, by the grace of God, they are passing the exams.

0:12:46.420,0:12:53.500
But what is to become of them in the future, that certificate may be useless.

0:12:53.500,0:12:56.860
I'm really urging parents.

0:12:56.860,0:13:02.540
We need to take our children to God. Especially when they are young.

0:13:02.540,0:13:05.340
We shouldn't just take them to church

0:13:05.340,0:13:08.600
because I took them to church but they were just playing around in church,

0:13:08.600,0:13:10.360
going to Sunday School and doing nothing.

0:13:10.380,0:13:15.440
After that we would go to KFC and then go home.

0:13:15.440,0:13:19.680
We didn't even discuss what we heard in church.

0:13:19.680,0:13:22.460
So it was a religious approach to things.

0:13:22.460,0:13:28.220
That religious approach is what caused her to not go to any church service

0:13:28.220,0:13:32.840
over the four to seven years she was in the UK.

0:13:32.840,0:13:36.000
She never learnt anything because her Sunday school was a nursery school.

0:13:36.000,0:13:40.080
Whilst I as the mother was attending the church service, she was playing.

0:13:40.080,0:13:47.620
So what I'm asking parents to know is that this is a terrible world.

0:13:47.620,0:13:50.900
Let's be careful and protect our children.

0:13:50.900,0:13:56.800
It is not by our strength but by taking them the person who gave them to you in the first place.

0:13:56.800,0:13:59.440
The gift is from Jesus, He's the one who gave them in the first place.

0:13:59.440,0:14:10.420
I will take you to Matthew 7:16-20 where it is said that a mango cannot beget a pineapple.

0:14:10.420,0:14:13.440
It means the people to blame for these children

0:14:13.440,0:14:19.920
or in other words, when you see your child misbehaving, look at yourself.

0:14:19.920,0:14:22.760
That is your mirror. That is you.

0:14:22.760,0:14:29.280
So what I am trying to say is that we should blame ourselves for what has become of our children.

0:14:29.280,0:14:31.560
My husband and I have blamed ourselves

0:14:31.560,0:14:33.820
because for sure, we were in the world,

0:14:33.820,0:14:37.880
even whilst we were doing some religious activities on Sundays.

0:14:37.880,0:14:39.680
But the truth is we were in the world.

0:14:39.680,0:14:44.380
So what did we pass on to our children? The worldly things.

0:14:44.380,0:14:50.940
Later when my daughter came back to Zimbabwe, I did not know she was smoking.

0:14:50.940,0:14:55.020
She used to sneak out during the night to the garden and smoke. Then, she came back into the house.

0:14:55.020,0:14:56.560
We thought all was well.

0:14:56.560,0:15:01.560
The day I started seeing her drinking habit getting worse was when I knew I was in trouble.

0:15:01.560,0:15:04.300
I started pumping her with Morning Water.

0:15:04.300,0:15:06.940
Sometimes she would be sleeping on her bed and I would go in her room.

0:15:06.940,0:15:10.120
I would spray the room, spray her and I would pray.

0:15:10.120,0:15:15.000
I would pray and say, "God, please, I have failed. I'm handing over this child to you.

0:15:15.000,0:15:19.360
You gave me this child. Redeem this child from this habit".

0:15:19.360,0:15:24.920
So when we came and the child was finally delivered, I found joy.

0:15:24.920,0:15:28.180
I found joy because she is now actually a lay preacher at our church.

0:15:28.180,0:15:31.100
For me that is actually extraordinary, comparing it with where she is coming from.

0:15:31.100,0:15:33.740
Wow! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:33.740,0:15:36.100
Hon. Dr Ruth Labode & Daughter - Deliverance testimony

0:15:36.100,0:15:40.860
Were you with her at the prayer line section where the man of God prayed for her?

0:15:40.860,0:15:42.280
Tell us - what happened?

0:15:42.280,0:15:47.240
I was with her at the prayer line. It was herself, the dad and I.

0:15:47.240,0:15:51.560
When the man of God just waved his hand, she fell.

0:15:51.560,0:15:53.760
In fact, I was worried that she was going to be injured.

0:15:53.760,0:15:58.820
She fell down and in the meantime I also fell to one side and my husband to another.

0:15:58.820,0:16:02.540
But when we stood up, she said something very interesting.

0:16:02.540,0:16:05.840
She said, "Mummy, someone pulled me down. I didn't fall".

0:16:05.840,0:16:09.200
I said, "No. Even the man of God didn't touch you.

0:16:09.200,0:16:11.760
He just waved his hand and you fell on your own.

0:16:11.760,0:16:14.000
And that was it".

0:16:14.000,0:16:19.940
There was a time we came and there was an all night prayer here.

0:16:19.940,0:16:23.660
That Friday she vomitted.

0:16:23.660,0:16:30.840
She used to have a nose ring and it popped out.

0:16:30.840,0:16:33.300
Maybe those were signs that her body was not clean.

0:16:33.300,0:16:37.240
There were a lot of things that weren't supposed to be there. I don't know.

0:16:37.240,0:16:40.860
We took it lighty and thought it was deliverance and we went home.

0:16:40.860,0:16:45.360
I'm so glad and grateful to God as God has been kind to us.

0:16:45.360,0:16:48.380
One by one He is dealing with us as a family.

0:16:48.380,0:16:50.780
Amen. Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:16:50.780,0:16:53.100
Hon. Dr Ruth Labode & Daughter - Deliverance testimony

0:16:53.100,0:16:57.640
Thank you, mama. Thank you for that wonderful word of advice to parents.

0:16:57.640,0:17:02.240
We would like to listen to your word of advice now as a youth.

0:17:02.240,0:17:06.020
Please, we want you to address the youth all over the world

0:17:06.020,0:17:11.740
concerning this smoking, drinking and other forms of addiction

0:17:11.740,0:17:17.660
that actually tarnish the future of the youth today and thank God you are delivered from it.

0:17:17.660,0:17:19.720
So what do you want to tell them?

0:17:19.720,0:17:23.360
Emmanuel to all the youth all over the world!

0:17:23.360,0:17:31.120
First of all, I want to encourage you to know and understand your Bible.

0:17:31.120,0:17:35.960
Seek first the Kingdom of God and then everything else will follow.

0:17:35.960,0:17:41.340
Do not surround yourself with people who are of the world.

0:17:41.340,0:17:46.660
I started smoking becase I was imitating my friends who were smokers

0:17:46.660,0:17:51.800
but I ended up overtaking them, smoking more cigarettes than they were.

0:17:51.800,0:17:57.040
You need to surround yourself with people of God - people of the same mission.

0:17:57.040,0:17:58.780
Listen to your parents.

0:17:58.780,0:18:04.000
When you go to church, don't go because you have to go.

0:18:04.000,0:18:11.040
Find it in your heart, pray to God and ask Him to open up your heart and make you have hunger for His Word.

0:18:11.040,0:18:12.740
Ask God to show Himself to you.

0:18:12.740,0:18:16.480
Ask Him to make you understand. The Holy Spirit should guide you and be your teacher.

0:18:16.480,0:18:19.400
It's important.

0:18:19.400,0:18:23.360
For me, it was my environment, the people around me.

0:18:23.360,0:18:28.000
At university, there were people who were Christians. But to me, they were boring.

0:18:28.000,0:18:32.960
In the world it is not all about being liked by other people.

0:18:32.960,0:18:35.500
It is about doing what is right for God.

0:18:35.500,0:18:38.920
That is what you need to do. Because eventually you are going to hear about God.

0:18:38.920,0:18:42.560
Eventually you are going to know and realise that what you are doing is bad.

0:18:42.560,0:18:50.660
So there is no point wasting years, money or time on things that will just kill you faster

0:18:50.660,0:18:53.340
because God has given us the gift of life.

0:18:53.340,0:18:56.980
If you walk the path of righteousness, you have a longer life.

0:18:56.980,0:19:00.720
If you walk the path of sin, your days are numbered.

0:19:00.720,0:19:04.520
So to all the youth - it is not worth it.

0:19:04.520,0:19:07.420
Listen to your parents, come back to God

0:19:07.420,0:19:10.100
and surround yourself with good people.

0:19:10.100,0:19:15.140
The Bible is your key, your guide, your map and everything.

0:19:15.140,0:19:20.300
You should know your Bible, understand it and do what the Bible says. Don't just read it and be a pharisee.

0:19:20.300,0:19:23.440
Do what the Bible says - that is the main thing. Thank you.

0:19:23.440,0:19:25.980
Thank you very much. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:19:25.980,0:19:28.500
Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:19:28.500,0:19:33.120
Thank you for that wonderful word of advice to the youth all over the world.

0:19:33.120,0:19:40.540
That is a food for thoughts because the Bible says that bad friends are epidemics.

0:19:40.540,0:19:42.800
Wayward friends are epidemics.

0:19:42.800,0:19:45.500
Bad companies corrupt good manners.

0:19:45.500,0:19:51.520
So wherever we find ourselves - on the campus, at work, school, anywhere -

0:19:51.520,0:19:55.440
we must not be too quick to trust

0:19:55.440,0:20:00.860
and we must not follow bad companies that will lead us to a wayward life.

0:20:00.860,0:20:04.920
And now that you have been set free, remember that Jesus Christ has delivered you

0:20:04.920,0:20:07.220
so that you might follow Him.

0:20:07.220,0:20:11.520
We now want to encourage you to make the Word of God the standard for your life

0:20:11.520,0:20:16.060
and as you do so, the blessings of God Almighty will continue to unfold in your life

0:20:16.060,0:20:18.960
and your future is guaranteed in Jesus' name!

0:20:18.960,0:20:20.480
Amen. Thank You, Jesus!

0:20:20.480,0:20:21.400
Thank you.
