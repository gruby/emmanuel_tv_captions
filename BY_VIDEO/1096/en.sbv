0:00:07.020,0:00:09.100
Good morning, Church!

0:00:09.100,0:00:11.920
Good morning.

0:00:11.920,0:00:19.040
Viewers all over the world, Good Morning!

0:00:19.040,0:00:21.520
Hallelujah!

0:00:21.520,0:00:26.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:26.260,0:00:28.420
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

0:00:28.420,0:00:40.400
Don’t forget – today is the last meeting before the birthday.

0:00:40.400,0:00:46.300
This is an opportunity to let you know whom you are celebrating.

0:00:46.300,0:00:52.060
How do we celebrate this kind of man?

0:00:52.060,0:00:57.700
You can see, he is not a superstar.

0:00:57.700,0:01:00.280
He is a man of people.

0:01:00.280,0:01:08.000
If he is a man of people, let us look for people who need what we have.

0:01:08.000,0:01:19.000
People who are in need – look for them; that is how to celebrate him.

0:01:19.000,0:01:23.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:23.200,0:01:25.340
Thank you.

0:01:25.340,0:01:28.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:28.620,0:01:32.400
I must give that honour and respect for the little ones.

0:01:32.400,0:01:34.720
Hallelujah.

0:01:34.720,0:01:39.960
Today is the last Sunday before the celebration.

0:01:39.960,0:01:49.860
You know you were born on June 12th!

0:01:49.860,0:01:52.700
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

0:01:52.700,0:01:59.020
You have many things to watch in terms of videos and recordings

0:01:59.020,0:02:10.680
concerning the man you are seeing today, your little brother, T.B. Joshua.

0:02:10.680,0:02:12.880
Thank you.

0:02:12.880,0:02:17.200
Right from the beginning of the ministry at the time you got to know T.B. Joshua,

0:02:17.200,0:02:32.100
you will study that humility because I found myself in a simple and humble family background.

0:02:32.100,0:02:37.080
That is what is reflecting in me.

0:02:37.080,0:02:49.900
When I say humble, simple, I mean, lacking basic needs of life.

0:02:49.900,0:02:57.160
To lack the basic needs of life, you know what it means.

0:02:57.160,0:03:04.400
I am going to show you the humble home I came from.

0:03:04.400,0:03:07.560
We still preserve this home.

0:03:07.560,0:03:10.420
When you go to my village, you will find it just the same.

0:03:10.420,0:03:14.240
I said, "No. Don't touch it. Leave it."

0:03:14.240,0:03:16.920
Let us see the humble home.

0:03:16.920,0:03:36.400
THIS IS THE PICTURE OF OUR HUMBLE HOME

0:03:36.400,0:03:40.260
That is my humble home I came from.

0:03:40.260,0:03:43.640
It is still there; we preserved it.

0:03:43.640,0:03:46.920
I said, "No. Don't touch it."

0:03:46.920,0:03:59.120
There was a very strong force which God is behind -

0:03:59.120,0:04:17.900
kept telling me that what I was going through was a preparation for my future.

0:04:17.900,0:04:21.720
I mean, a strong force I could not resist.

0:04:21.720,0:04:30.540
As I am standing here, there is a force that is telling me

0:04:30.540,0:04:40.180
that what you are going through right now may not be found tomorrow.

0:04:40.180,0:04:52.280
In those early years of my life, I knew I would be blamed if I gave my attention

0:04:52.280,0:04:56.460
to what I was going through.

0:04:56.460,0:05:03.100
Consequently, I did not want my focus to be broken.

0:05:03.100,0:05:16.960
I chose to direct my focus on the right path, on what is right

0:05:16.960,0:05:28.420
because of the strong force that was directing me; I could not resist that force.

0:05:28.420,0:05:43.660
As I am standing now, there is a force I cannot resist which God is behind.

0:05:43.660,0:05:47.360
I cannot resist; it is telling me...

0:05:47.360,0:05:59.840
Each time I try to go wrong, it will say to me, "No. Go this way."

0:05:59.840,0:06:20.000
Anytime I felt I was missing my focus, it became a very strong motivation to pray

0:06:20.000,0:06:23.580
and be closer to God.

0:06:23.580,0:06:27.180
As a human being, there must be...

0:06:27.180,0:06:38.160
But anytime - it became a very strong motivation to pray to God, and to be closer to God.

0:06:38.160,0:06:45.960
It was still the same strong, mighty force that kept telling me,

0:06:45.960,0:06:49.660
“Concentrate on your future. Ignore the present.

0:06:49.660,0:06:52.640
Concentrate on your future; ignore what you are going through.

0:06:52.640,0:07:00.100
Concentrate on your future because what you are going through may not be found tomorrow”.

0:07:00.100,0:07:04.840
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR FUTURE

0:07:04.840,0:07:06.640
Concentrate on your future.

0:07:06.640,0:07:17.180
What you are going through is a preparation for your future, a bridge to your future.

0:07:17.180,0:07:29.740
The more I prayed, the less people would see me and the more isolated I became.

0:07:29.740,0:07:37.660
This affected all of my social life.

0:07:37.660,0:07:46.080
In those days, my colleagues and friends around complained

0:07:46.080,0:07:53.560
that I was not social and civilised enough like them.

0:07:53.560,0:07:59.600
That was their complain, "That guy - leave him. Let him go."

0:07:59.600,0:08:02.140
That kept me isolated.

0:08:02.140,0:08:11.860
They complained I was not social and civilised enough like them.

0:08:11.860,0:08:29.140
In this way, wrong, mistakes became an incentive that drew me closer to God

0:08:29.140,0:08:36.940
instead of otherwise.

0:08:36.940,0:08:53.120
Tell your neighbour, “If you make a mistake, don’t run from God; run to Him”.

0:08:53.120,0:09:04.840
Wrong became an incentive that drew me closer to God.

0:09:04.840,0:09:09.200
Whatever you are going through now, listen to me.

0:09:09.200,0:09:17.140
Whatever your present challenge is now, whatever your tribulation or condition,

0:09:17.140,0:09:27.020
it’s merely a preparation for your future.

0:09:27.020,0:09:33.100
It may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for your future.

0:09:33.100,0:09:38.400
That is why it may not be found.

0:09:38.400,0:09:50.160
Tell your neighbour, “Whatever I am going through, whatever the challenge or difficulty,

0:09:50.160,0:10:03.700
it may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for the future."

0:10:03.700,0:10:05.400
What are you going through?

0:10:05.400,0:10:07.560
You just need to know this.

0:10:07.560,0:10:12.740
Like I have told you, there was a force I could not resist.

0:10:12.740,0:10:17.360
I tried to resist, but each time the voice, "No. Do this."

0:10:17.360,0:10:19.240
I could not resist it.

0:10:19.240,0:10:26.500
The voice kept telling me, “Concentrate on your future

0:10:26.500,0:10:33.920
because the situation you are in now may not be found tomorrow”.

0:10:33.920,0:10:44.420
Once again, Happy Birthday in advance!

0:10:44.420,0:10:49.240
I was a baby before the death of my father.

0:10:49.240,0:10:58.320
You know little baby before the death of my father.

0:10:58.320,0:11:07.460
Consequently, I knew nothing about my late father

0:11:07.460,0:11:18.040
and the entire family burden rested squarely on my mother’s shoulder.

0:11:18.040,0:11:22.300
Let them show you the picture of my late father.

0:11:22.300,0:11:32.060
THIS IS THE PICTURE OF MY LATE FATHER, G.K. BALOGUN

0:11:32.060,0:11:44.300
THIS IS THE PICTURE OF MY LATE MOTHER, FOLARIN BALOGUN WHO GAVE ME HER LAST HUG

0:11:44.300,0:11:52.900
This is my mum; the last hug, "Bye bye", given to me.

0:11:52.900,0:11:56.580
Hallelujah.

0:11:56.580,0:12:04.880
I want to pay a special tribute to my late mother,

0:12:04.880,0:12:12.380
who always advised me to look into my love walk.

0:12:12.380,0:12:19.980
Failing to do so can shut down our relationship with God.

0:12:19.980,0:12:28.460
I salute her.

0:12:28.460,0:12:31.940
What a wonderful woman!

0:12:31.940,0:12:36.960
She never failed to call us for prayer before going to bed.

0:12:36.960,0:12:39.480
When I was baby...

0:12:39.480,0:12:45.980
It was a must, a duty; she called us for prayer before going to bed.

0:12:45.980,0:13:00.060
Don’t forget – prayer from the heart is Spirit prayer; it leads to dreams and revelations.

0:13:00.060,0:13:07.780
That really helped greatly; the impact was so great.

0:13:07.780,0:13:19.660
I often dreamt; I was always taught the Scriptures in the dream ‘til now.

0:13:19.660,0:13:26.660
That gave me an urge; over...

0:13:26.660,0:13:41.740
I was the smallest boy in my class but always led prayer.

0:13:41.740,0:13:52.180
When you look at the picture, you will see me very little among them, but I always led the prayer.

0:13:52.180,0:14:00.200
My teachers and colleagues always called me ‘small pastor’.

0:14:00.200,0:14:08.240
I think some of you might have watched the video in the past; they always called me 'small pastor'.

0:14:08.240,0:14:30.420
In human life, many things could cause one to stop between steps.

0:14:30.420,0:14:40.440
For example, my educational career suffered epileptic fits.

0:14:40.440,0:14:44.640
What I mean by 'epileptic fits'?

0:14:44.640,0:14:50.780
Today I am in school, the next day out.

0:14:50.780,0:14:59.840
I was very smart and brilliant but the reason was beyond me.

0:14:59.840,0:15:09.180
I attended six colleges in less than one year.

0:15:09.180,0:15:12.800
If I may begin with...

0:15:12.800,0:15:19.620
My first college was Ansar-Ud-Deen Grammar School, Ikare (AUD).

0:15:19.620,0:15:28.200
From there, I left the village back to Lagos in a mysterious way.

0:15:28.200,0:15:41.480
There are many records I am still keeping for 60, 70, 80, 90!

0:15:41.480,0:15:46.060
Because I know you keep asking yourself, “Why now is this man showing this record?”

0:15:46.060,0:15:47.040
Yes.

0:15:47.040,0:15:54.240
Now, I started at the age of 55; another record at 60; I keep so many.

0:15:54.240,0:15:58.860
I am going to show you just 10 percent of those records today.

0:15:58.860,0:16:12.460
I began my college at Ansar-Ud-Deen Grammar School in Ikare, called AUD, in a mysterious way.

0:16:12.460,0:16:18.200
I was one of the 'late candidates', 'late admission'.

0:16:18.200,0:16:27.100
I was in E class, classes were not supposed to extend to E, they stopped at D.

0:16:27.100,0:16:39.920
I spent nine months and left mysteriously back to Lagos.

0:16:39.920,0:16:48.620
When I came to Lagos, the first college I attended was Metropolitan College in Isolo.

0:16:48.620,0:16:55.120
I was there for three months.

0:16:55.120,0:17:09.280
I left to New State High School and spent one month there.

0:17:09.280,0:17:20.040
From New State High School, I went to Bishop Aggrey College where I spent three months.

0:17:20.040,0:17:36.300
From there to Ikotun, there is a college where we were the first students there; it was called Muslim College.

0:17:36.300,0:17:39.420
I spent three months also there.

0:17:39.420,0:17:42.200
All this happened in less than one year.

0:17:42.200,0:17:45.580
I was moving from...

0:17:45.580,0:17:49.920
The reason was beyond me, I will not be able to explain it.

0:17:49.920,0:17:55.800
The first college - I can only share this with you because of time.

0:17:55.800,0:18:08.360
At the first college AUD in Ikare, suddenly one night at 3am, I never knew what took me out.

0:18:08.360,0:18:15.280
I was on the street at 3am, just going on the street.

0:18:15.280,0:18:26.520
It was a watchman who saw me, rescued my life and placed me at his duty post until daybreak.

0:18:26.520,0:18:32.960
He later took me to the authorities in the school to explain.

0:18:32.960,0:18:38.460
Then, I was 'half-balanced'.

0:18:38.460,0:18:43.500
I could not continue my education; back to my mummy.

0:18:43.500,0:18:47.060
I spent another two years at home.

0:18:47.060,0:18:55.640
That is one; I will not be able to tell you about the others because of time; at 60 I will share with you.

0:18:55.640,0:19:00.880
HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!

0:19:00.880,0:19:11.680
I attended six colleges in less than one year.

0:19:11.680,0:19:20.780
I told you this; whatever you are going through now, whatever situation you are in

0:19:20.780,0:19:28.260
may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for your future.

0:19:28.260,0:19:29.920
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:29.920,0:19:37.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:37.880,0:19:44.740
Whatever you are going through, whatever you are facing

0:19:44.740,0:19:52.400
may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for your future,

0:19:52.400,0:19:55.980
to link you to the future.

0:19:55.980,0:20:04.700
Now, I want to begin to show you some records. Let me start from my birth.

0:20:04.700,0:20:12.880
The record I am about to show you is not saying I have arrived

0:20:12.880,0:20:22.620
but to encourage the weak and those without fast legs or human help

0:20:22.620,0:20:34.100
that there is hope – Jesus is the hope.

0:20:34.100,0:20:43.980
I stayed in my mother’s womb for fifteen months.

0:20:43.980,0:20:51.420
At nine months, my mother was moving from one medical centre to another

0:20:51.420,0:20:53.960
because she was in labour.

0:20:53.960,0:21:02.840
From nine months, my mother began labour and she was moving from one medical centre

0:21:02.840,0:21:14.880
to another hospital until she was carried to a place called Egbe Medical Centre.

0:21:14.880,0:21:25.960
At that time, it seemed to be the best hospital in Nigeria, if not one of the best.

0:21:25.960,0:21:27.780
Go to the record.

0:21:27.780,0:21:31.600
So, let's see the picture of the hospital where my mummy finally delivered me.

0:21:31.600,0:21:37.280
THIS IS THE PICTURE OF EGBE HOSPITAL, WHERE I WAS BORN AT LAST

0:21:37.280,0:21:49.720
AFTER MY MOTHER VISITED MANY MEDICAL CENTRES

0:21:49.720,0:21:51.860
Yes.

0:21:51.860,0:22:00.120
When I was delivered and about to be named on the seventh day in a naming ceremony,

0:22:00.120,0:22:10.620
arrangements were made and many guests turned up who wanted to see a child

0:22:10.620,0:22:14.460
who spent fifteen months in his mother’s womb.

0:22:14.460,0:22:20.560
You can imagine the number of people that were present.

0:22:20.560,0:22:31.980
In our village, there is so much rock that needs to be blasted before getting water.

0:22:31.980,0:22:41.020
It became a habit; everyday, they had to blast to get water from the ground.

0:22:41.020,0:22:48.780
Opposite the house where I was about to be named,

0:22:48.780,0:22:54.820
there was a company that was blasting rocks for water.

0:22:54.820,0:22:59.160
Suddenly, a very big stone...

0:22:59.160,0:23:01.780
You cannot imagine - the stone is here with me.

0:23:01.780,0:23:09.780
A big stone flew from the opposite direction straight to the same humble home

0:23:09.780,0:23:17.480
and landed on the exact net where I was lying.

0:23:17.480,0:23:19.340
What happened?

0:23:19.340,0:23:33.180
No one knows how Baby Joshua moved from the net to the other side of the room.

0:23:33.180,0:23:34.740
What happened to the mother?

0:23:34.740,0:23:41.680
She fainted, went into a coma and was carried to the hospital.

0:23:41.680,0:23:47.720
The guests and the people waiting for the ceremony were saying, "What happened?

0:23:47.720,0:23:52.020
We are here to see the child who spent 15 months in the womb and was delivered.

0:23:52.020,0:23:54.100
This is what happened.

0:23:54.100,0:23:56.840
The baby was saved."

0:23:56.840,0:24:06.720
Out of sheer wonder and surprise, they started voicing different names.

0:24:06.720,0:24:22.660
Temitope, Tope, Temidire, Temioluwa, Temidayo – different names.

0:24:22.660,0:24:29.980
I decided to choose Temitope out of those names.

0:24:29.980,0:24:31.880
Are you ready to watch the stone?

0:24:31.880,0:24:32.860
Yes.

0:24:32.860,0:24:35.880
OK, please watch.

0:24:35.880,0:24:39.180
The Town Where Prophet T.B. Joshua Was Brought Up – Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria

0:24:39.180,0:24:48.920
In 1963, a humble home, in a rural district of Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria, became the scene

0:24:48.920,0:24:57.240
of an incredible miracle; a child had finally been born, after 15 months in his mother's womb.

0:24:57.240,0:25:02.300
However, anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:25:02.300,0:25:07.460
The devil attempted to snatch away this young life, just days later,

0:25:07.460,0:25:13.300
but what the devil meant for evil, God meant for good.

0:25:13.300,0:25:19.860
Moving through the compound, we arrive at the small house in which Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:25:19.860,0:25:23.640
was raised and spent his childhood days.

0:25:23.640,0:25:30.320
A closer inspection of the roof reveals a noticeably large hole.

0:25:30.320,0:25:34.580
What could possibly have happened to create such damage?

0:25:34.580,0:25:44.960
A Hole In The Roof Of Prophet T.B. Joshua’s Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria

0:25:44.960,0:25:53.240
Peering through the hole, a jagged stone can be seen lying on the floor of this modest home.

0:25:53.240,0:26:06.480
Inside The Childhood Home Of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:26:06.480,0:26:13.300
This is the small room, in which Prophet T.B. Joshua grew up with his family.

0:26:13.300,0:26:18.140
This is a house with a remarkable story to tell.

0:26:18.140,0:26:21.520
A Hole In The Roof Of Prophet T.B. Joshua’s Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria

0:26:21.520,0:26:28.380
Let someone who was there that day tell you the story and unravel the mystery.

0:26:28.380,0:26:35.620
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

0:26:35.620,0:26:43.360
A water pipe was being dug at a nearby site and you were laid here, sleeping.

0:26:43.360,0:26:55.540
Shockingly, a stone flew from the site through this zinc and landed very close to where you were sleeping.

0:26:55.540,0:26:56.440
Where is the stone?

0:26:56.440,0:26:57.340
This is the very stone.

0:26:57.340,0:26:58.840
Has the stone been kept since then?

0:26:58.840,0:27:04.580
It is the very one. We did not throw it away ever since.

0:27:04.580,0:27:08.720
When they gave birth to you and you were about to be named.

0:27:08.720,0:27:16.820
This is where we all were sleeping and where we gave birth to all our children.

0:27:16.820,0:27:19.520
We did not sleep elsewhere.

0:27:19.520,0:27:31.860
If one could go outside, the broken part of the zinc that was covered is still visible.

0:27:31.860,0:27:35.640
You were laid here and the stone fell beside you.

0:27:35.640,0:27:38.000
Is this the particular stone?

0:27:38.000,0:27:43.440
This was the point it was broken.

0:27:43.440,0:27:48.060
Can you see it?

0:27:48.060,0:27:49.660
So, what happened to me?

0:27:49.660,0:27:56.760
Jesus rescued you and made you healthy.

0:27:56.760,0:28:01.920
I didn’t throw it away. It is part of history.

0:28:01.920,0:28:10.020
Somebody advised me to smoothen it and use it as a grinding stone but I refused

0:28:10.020,0:28:17.780
because of the mysterious and miraculous role God used it to play in this family.

0:28:17.780,0:28:22.620
It wasn’t like this on the day the incident occurred.

0:28:22.620,0:28:30.060
Eventually, however, we shall create a special box for the stone.

0:28:30.060,0:28:36.120
This was how you were laid on the ground; your mother slept close to you.

0:28:36.120,0:28:57.900
There was a local lamp near your mother’s head and a fire used to treat your mother’s stomach.

0:28:57.900,0:29:07.160
The stone suddenly crashed down near you. Before God and man, that was what happened.

0:29:07.160,0:29:11.320
Glory be to the name of the Lord.

The stone they found when they were blasting rock – this is it.

0:30:10.680,0:30:14.500
HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!

0:30:14.500,0:30:28.560
The Stone That Flew Through The Roof And Landed Next To Where T.B. Joshua Lay At 7 Days Old

0:30:28.560,0:30:32.460
This is the stone; this is T.B. Joshua!

0:30:32.460,0:30:34.080
Thank you.

0:30:34.080,0:30:41.520
HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!

0:30:41.520,0:30:46.360
I’m older than the stone, by seven days!

0:30:46.360,0:30:50.400
It came out on the seventh day, when I was about to be named.

0:30:50.400,0:30:55.040
So, the stone must be fifty...

0:30:55.040,0:30:58.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:58.600,0:30:59.820
Thank you.

0:30:59.820,0:31:02.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:02.580,0:31:11.280
Like I have said; we are not showing you this because we are saying we have arrived but

0:31:11.280,0:31:18.660
it is an encouragement to the weak, to those without fast legs and

0:31:18.660,0:31:31.240
those without human help, the under-privileged, that there is hope and Jesus is the hope.

0:31:31.240,0:31:34.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:34.880,0:31:45.320
So, we will begin to show you from where the ministry started and the name - Synagogue Church of All Nations,

0:31:45.320,0:31:48.700
the foundation of the church; we will show you now - you will see.

0:31:48.700,0:31:53.140
All this is not acting; it’s real.

0:31:53.140,0:31:56.620
It’s a real record.

0:31:56.620,0:32:05.220
Prophet T.B. Joshua Walks Through The Town And Children Follow Him

0:32:05.220,0:32:08.940
Hallelujah!

0:32:08.940,0:32:13.040
Let us be seated. 
Amen!

0:32:13.040,0:32:23.000
In fact, I don’t know where to start.

0:32:23.000,0:32:24.780
Amen!

0:32:24.780,0:32:34.740
My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.

0:32:34.740,0:32:42.320
I am here to lay a foundation – that today, we start The Synagogue here!

0:32:42.320,0:32:45.680
Amen!

0:32:45.680,0:32:48.440
Hallelujah!

0:32:48.440,0:32:54.040
The Synagogue has started here!

0:32:54.040,0:32:58.260
I have come to launch a good foundation for the church.

0:32:58.260,0:33:01.220
Amen!

0:33:01.220,0:33:06.000
You should know that this man always says things in proverbs.

0:33:06.000,0:33:07.320
They say that Jesus is coming.

0:33:07.320,0:33:11.460
All the elders here have been hearing from a young age that Jesus is coming.

0:33:11.460,0:33:18.860
We have been expecting His coming up until now and we are still preparing for it.

0:33:18.860,0:33:24.500
The reason Jesus has not come is because He wants you and I to repent from our sins

0:33:24.500,0:33:27.120
because He doesn’t want anyone to perish.

0:33:27.120,0:33:30.320
Have you repented?

0:33:30.320,0:33:33.840
HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!

0:33:33.840,0:33:37.200
Hallelujah!

0:33:37.200,0:33:43.320
The reason the coming of Jesus is delayed is because God wants you to repent.

0:33:43.320,0:33:46.800
Repent from your sin, so that you will not perish.

0:33:46.800,0:33:50.740
By the time Jesus comes, you will not perish; you will inherit the Kingdom of God.

0:33:50.740,0:33:55.380
Right from your childhood, you have been learning that Jesus will come like a thief in the night.

0:33:55.380,0:33:57.900
We have been waiting for the coming of Jesus.

0:33:57.900,0:34:02.220
The reason the coming of Jesus has been delayed is because of you and me.

0:34:02.220,0:34:05.800
Jesus wants you to repent; He doesn’t want you to perish.

0:34:05.800,0:34:09.980
By the time He comes, He can carry you to eternal life.

0:34:09.980,0:34:16.380
If Jesus should come and you have not repented, the coming of Jesus in your life has no meaning.

0:34:16.380,0:34:20.720
In order for the coming of Jesus to have meaning in your life, you need to repent.

0:34:20.720,0:34:24.240
You have to repent today and accept Jesus,

0:34:24.240,0:34:27.860
so that when Jesus comes, you can join Him in the Kingdom of God.

0:34:27.860,0:34:34.700
So, for me and my house – and I believe you are my house – we will serve the Lord.

0:34:34.700,0:34:39.380
Clap for Jesus!

0:34:39.380,0:34:40.200
Hallelujah!

0:34:40.200,0:34:51.400
We thank God. Even if you want me to prostrate for you, I am ready!

LEISURE TIME WITH PROPHET TB JOSHUA

0:41:50.900,0:41:55.620
Leisure time with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:41:55.620,0:42:02.240
Playing with nature is a leisure time with nature to ease tension and stress.

0:42:02.240,0:42:07.820
Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:42:07.820,0:42:14.280
I want to encourage you to often find a natural environment to read your Bible

0:42:14.280,0:42:21.460
because natural environment is natural and free from distraction.

0:42:21.460,0:42:25.820
Nature itself enhances spirituality.

0:42:25.820,0:42:30.040
I often read my Bible in a calm and quiet environment

0:42:30.040,0:42:35.460
because the Bible is not like other books you can read anywhere and understand.

0:42:35.460,0:42:41.400
Understanding of the Bible is understanding the nature of God.

0:42:41.400,0:42:48.480
Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:42:48.480,0:42:53.220
It must be read in an enabling environment to understand it.

0:42:53.220,0:42:58.120
To live it, it must be read in an enabling environment.

0:42:58.120,0:43:02.340
To teach it, it can be read anywhere.

0:43:02.340,0:44:36.080
Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:44:36.080,0:44:41.220
Leisure time - time to be refreshed and be renewed.

0:44:41.220,0:44:49.020
God's Word refreshes our mind, God's Spirit renews our strength.

0:44:49.020,0:45:27.920
Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:45:27.920,0:45:33.600
You can now see the kind of man you are celebrating is not a superstar;

0:45:33.600,0:45:36.960
he is a man of the people.

0:45:36.960,0:45:40.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:45:40.360,0:45:45.980
How do we celebrate this kind of man?

0:45:45.980,0:45:51.740
You can see, he is not a superstar.

0:45:51.740,0:45:54.360
He is a man of people.

0:45:54.360,0:46:03.700
If he is a man of people, let us look for people who need what we have.

0:46:03.700,0:46:15.320
People who are in need – look for them; that is how to celebrate him.

0:46:15.320,0:46:17.780
He is a man of people.

0:46:17.780,0:46:20.520
The man we are seeing is a man of people.

0:46:20.520,0:46:28.180
There is no way a man can be raised in such a simple and humble family background

0:46:28.180,0:46:31.900
and now turn to a superstar; it is not possible.

0:46:31.900,0:46:38.280
This is a man of people; to celebrate him, you must look for those who are in need,

0:46:38.280,0:46:48.000
people that are in need of what you have – your love, your care – look for them.

0:46:48.000,0:46:50.520
Someone is out there who needs your care.

0:46:50.520,0:46:52.620
Someone is out there who needs your money.

0:46:52.620,0:46:54.780
Someone is out there who needs your love.

0:46:54.780,0:47:01.080
Someone is out there who needs your smile – look for them.

0:47:01.080,0:47:06.400
Thank you!
Happy Birthday!
