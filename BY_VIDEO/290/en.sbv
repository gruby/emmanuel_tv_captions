0:00:00.000,0:00:05.380
Viewers all over the world, I want to say thank you.

0:00:05.380,0:00:08.020
I salute your faith.

0:00:08.020,0:00:15.200
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:15.220,0:00:17.520
Hallelujah!

0:00:17.520,0:00:20.180
I really want to be one of you today

0:00:20.180,0:00:24.520
so the message I have for you, I will read it page by page

0:00:24.520,0:00:26.580
so that you can be able to write it down.

0:00:26.580,0:00:29.700
Thank you.

0:00:29.740,0:00:37.700
Let me first of all say "thanks" to the following organisations and their support.

0:00:37.700,0:00:42.920
First, the state we are today – Lagos State and the Federal Government of Nigeria.

0:00:42.920,0:00:48.140
Thank you very much for your support and your prayer.

0:00:48.140,0:00:52.960
And the security agencies of different bodies -

0:00:52.960,0:00:58.280
I will not be able to mention you one by one, we have many security agencies around.

0:00:58.280,0:01:05.120
I want to salute you and thank you very much for your love and your prayer, and your support.

0:01:05.120,0:01:12.900
Let me also remember engineers and humanitarian groups with their equipment.

0:01:12.900,0:01:17.960
For some days now, I want to say thank you once again for your support.

0:01:17.960,0:01:24.920
Rescuers from different bodies – you just see people from everywhere.

0:01:24.920,0:01:30.080
Let me remember the doctors – what a wonderful people from all over... ,

0:01:30.080,0:01:36.360
not even Nigeria alone, but from everywhere and their hospitals too.

0:01:36.360,0:01:40.740
Media – I want to say "thank you" to the media

0:01:40.740,0:01:46.400
because I know the relationship of Jesus Christ with the media in the Bible.

0:01:46.400,0:01:51.380
Yes. Emmanuel TV is the media of Synagogue.

0:01:51.380,0:01:54.620
If we fight the media, we are fighting Emmanuel TV.

0:01:54.620,0:02:01.100
So, we want to salute you. Thank you very much.

0:02:01.160,0:02:05.720
Members and partners all over the world,

0:02:05.720,0:02:14.700
a big thanks! I am giving you a hug! Thank you for your prayer and love.

0:02:14.700,0:02:19.620
Neighbours, thank you very much for your support and your prayer.

0:02:19.620,0:02:31.300
Clergy and Christians all over the world – I want to say a very big thanks, and I salute your faith.

0:02:31.360,0:02:38.160
Let me remember diplomatic missions all over the world.

0:02:38.160,0:02:46.400
We received letters from nearly all the embassies, praying and supporting us in prayer

0:02:46.400,0:02:48.820
and asking what they can do.

0:02:48.820,0:02:56.900
I want to say thank you diplomatic missions all the world - thank you very much.

0:02:56.960,0:03:01.920
I want to use this opportunity to thank you.

0:03:01.920,0:03:05.540
There are many organizations I will not be able to mention.

0:03:05.540,0:03:08.800
If there is any organization I have not mentioned here,

0:03:08.800,0:03:12.660
I want to say thank you for your prayer and your love.

0:03:12.660,0:03:15.900
I want to start my message here.

0:03:15.900,0:03:23.240
I will just give you a detail because the security agencies need to do their job.

0:03:23.240,0:03:29.580
In a nutshell, let me start from the very day - that was Friday morning.

0:03:29.580,0:03:31.660
I was in the mountain.

0:03:31.660,0:03:43.380
I left there at exactly 8am in the morning and I received a phone call immediately.

0:03:43.380,0:03:47.960
After receiving a phone call, I immediately got here.

0:03:47.960,0:03:50.600
It was just a ten minutes interval.

0:03:50.600,0:03:56.020
When I was in the church, there was a jet hovering,

0:03:56.020,0:04:03.740
moving around at a very close range at the mountain which I had just left.

0:04:03.740,0:04:11.680
The place I left at the mountain, I received a phone call that there is a jet moving around that spot.

0:04:11.680,0:04:15.340
Well, I told them that I was in the church.

0:04:15.340,0:04:20.780
Before I knew it, I received a phone call again that there was a jet here,

0:04:20.780,0:04:25.700
the same jet here,

0:04:25.780,0:04:30.760
at the church, hovering around a building,

0:04:30.760,0:04:40.860
passing over the building four times at a very low range, before the building collapsed.

0:04:40.860,0:04:52.100
So, we are going to show you the video because the CCTV covered it.

0:04:52.160,0:04:55.300
OK, let's watch before I continue.

0:04:55.300,0:05:04.860
September 12, 2014. A building at the SCOAN collapses after a strange aircraft flies low,

0:05:04.860,0:05:09.240
multiple times over it before disappearing.

0:05:09.240,0:05:15.400
SCOAN visitors captured the strange aircraft on their camera at the entrance of the building.

0:05:15.400,0:05:22.860
A SCOAN visitor's photo – a strange aircraft flies low over a building at the SCOAN.

0:05:22.860,0:05:25.680
This is an enlarged view of the photograph taken.

0:05:25.680,0:05:32.900
It reveals the close proximity at which the strange aircraft flew over the building shortly before its collapse.

0:05:32.900,0:05:40.240
Let us listen to the visitors who took the photo, saw the aircraft and survived – September 12, 2014.

0:05:40.240,0:05:43.260
My name is Shadrack Mamzini. I am from South Africa.

0:05:43.260,0:05:46.600
We arrived here in September 11, 2014.

0:05:46.600,0:05:54.040
After the service in the main church, we went out for lunch.

0:05:54.040,0:06:00.300
When I was entering the other part of the church,

0:06:00.300,0:06:04.680
I wanted to take some pictures of the SCOAN buildings.

0:06:04.680,0:06:07.560
I took two pictures.

0:06:07.560,0:06:13.820
While I was taking the last picture, I discovered a very big aircraft.

0:06:13.820,0:06:18.420
It was something which was unusual in the way it looked.

0:06:18.420,0:06:23.560
It did not look like a passenger flight or an ordinary flight.

0:06:23.560,0:06:26.520
I asked myself what it was.

0:06:26.520,0:06:31.200
I thought maybe it was because the airport was close and the aircraft was going to land.

0:06:31.200,0:06:37.180
My worry was that it was too low to the building.

0:06:37.180,0:06:45.720
In South Africa, that kind of plane, such big aircrafts, don’t fly close to buildings.

0:06:45.720,0:06:52.460
I thought to myself that because the airport is close, the aircraft was trying to go and land.

0:06:52.460,0:06:57.120
There was a certain lady, who came into the canteen shouting and screaming,

0:06:57.120,0:07:01.660
crying that the building had collapsed.

0:07:01.660,0:07:09.640
It was when we went outside to see that, we saw it had collapsed.

0:07:09.640,0:07:15.280
I zoomed the picture where I saw the aircraft clearly on the picture.

0:07:15.280,0:07:19.040
This is a photograph taken by Mr Shadrack on his cell phone.

0:07:19.040,0:07:24.700
A look at the upper left-hand corner reveals the strange aircraft as it flew over the building.

0:07:24.700,0:07:32.580
By the time the incident happened, there were a lot of talks on it, that maybe the structure was poor.

0:07:32.580,0:07:36.400
Some said that the engineers were this and that.

0:07:36.400,0:07:39.220
It was until the man of God revealed what really happened,

0:07:39.220,0:07:45.620
I went back to check my photos, all the photos I had taken.

0:07:45.620,0:07:50.000
My name is Thobile Bhaku. I'm coming from South Africa.

0:07:50.000,0:07:55.720
When I entered the building, I heard the aircraft but I did not care about the aircraft.

0:07:55.720,0:08:01.300
I went inside the dining hall because it was lunch time.

0:08:01.300,0:08:04.880
On the queue, I was served.

0:08:04.880,0:08:15.380
While I was preparing coffee for myself, I heard a big sound behind me.

0:08:15.380,0:08:21.440
It was something like a big bang.

0:08:21.440,0:08:27.580
When I looked up, I saw the slab falling down.

0:08:27.580,0:08:34.020
Because of my experiences – I am a health and safety officer -

0:08:34.020,0:08:36.440
I have been trained on what to do.

0:08:36.440,0:08:41.800
When a beam is falling on top of you, you have to go opposite direction.

0:08:41.800,0:08:44.620
I ran to the opposite direction.

0:08:44.620,0:08:52.000
As I was running to the opposite direction, I saw the walls were cracking all over.

0:08:52.000,0:08:58.520
Suddenly, I was on the floor and it was dark, as if it was not during the day.

0:08:58.520,0:09:02.600
It was very, very hot and dark on the inside.

0:09:02.600,0:09:07.260
But in some cases, we could feel that there was fresh air coming in.

0:09:07.260,0:09:10.000
We did not know were the fresh air was coming from.

0:09:10.000,0:09:12.360
We prayed to God and thanked God.

0:09:12.360,0:09:16.580
We thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for praying for us.

0:09:16.580,0:09:19.540
All of us there, we are alive.

0:09:19.540,0:09:23.140
My name is Mick Milambo. I am from South Africa.

0:09:23.140,0:09:25.420
Originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

0:09:25.420,0:09:28.480
I was walking with my friend, Joseph.

0:09:28.480,0:09:34.560
He is not here; he went back to South Africa today.

0:09:34.560,0:09:39.600
At the time, we walked and had just crossed the gate here.

0:09:39.600,0:09:41.640
We saw the aircraft.

0:09:41.640,0:09:46.880
It was just passing here, slowly – a big aircraft.

0:09:46.880,0:09:52.740
My friend told me, "If you see an aircraft like this, it is trouble".

0:09:52.740,0:09:58.980
The sound was not that big; it was small and it was a big aircraft.

0:09:58.980,0:10:03.900
But it was passing, not far but slowly.

0:10:03.900,0:10:09.240
After that, we went into the same building the aircraft had passed over.

0:10:09.240,0:10:11.980
That was the same building we were going to.

0:10:11.980,0:10:14.920
Our lunch was supposed to be taken there.

0:10:14.920,0:10:19.640
After that, they started serving lunch.

0:10:19.640,0:10:23.360
We managed to get our lunch.

0:10:23.360,0:10:31.100
I can say about after ten minutes, I heard just a sound.

0:10:31.100,0:10:36.340
You know, it was like glass, when you break glass.

0:10:36.340,0:10:39.600
We were just here; the wall was behind us.

0:10:39.600,0:10:47.420
We just turned to look at what had happened and we saw this thing was coming to us, fast.

0:10:47.420,0:10:51.320
It was very fast.

0:10:51.320,0:10:54.260
That was the sound.

0:10:54.260,0:10:56.480
Everyone was down.

0:10:56.480,0:10:59.120
We started calling each other.

0:10:59.120,0:11:02.380
Amazingly, everyone was alive.

0:11:02.380,0:11:05.200
We communicated with everyone.

0:11:05.200,0:11:09.980
We started praying.

0:11:09.980,0:11:16.760
God is great; we didn’t cease to shout the name of Jesus down there.

0:11:16.760,0:11:18.400
Emmanuel!
(God with us – Matthew 1:23)

0:11:18.400,0:11:26.820
Here speaks Charles Thawane from Johannesburg, South Africa.

0:11:26.820,0:11:29.180
On Friday, we were in the church.

0:11:29.180,0:11:38.420
At lunch time, we went out and were moving to where they were serving.

0:11:38.420,0:11:43.600
Where we were going was next to the building that later fell.

0:11:43.600,0:11:46.100
I saw the aircraft was going to the building

0:11:46.100,0:11:51.860
but I was with my friend and he was just taking photos of the SCOAN buildings.

0:11:51.860,0:11:55.620
That aircraft, when it came, I did not think it would come to the building

0:11:55.620,0:11:59.620
because it was coming as if it was going to pass the building

0:11:59.620,0:12:03.760
but suddenly when we saw it on the photo, it was turning to the building.

0:12:03.760,0:12:05.840
It was big.

0:12:05.840,0:12:10.440
It was big but it was not having sound too much.

0:12:10.440,0:12:16.460
The sound was not too much because if it was too much, I think everybody was going to look up.

0:12:16.460,0:12:19.400
It was a silent one when it was moving.

0:12:19.400,0:12:20.900
It was moving very slowly.

0:12:20.900,0:12:24.460
It looked like a jet.

0:12:24.460,0:12:29.180
It didn’t look like an ordinary plane that you take when you go somewhere.

0:12:29.180,0:12:31.120
After that, we passed the building.

0:12:31.120,0:12:33.880
We were going to where we were going to eat.

0:12:33.880,0:12:37.440
Then, my friend was still taking those photos.

0:12:37.440,0:12:42.080
That was what I had seen and then, that was it.

0:12:42.080,0:12:49.320
What I would like to confirm is what people saw on Emmanuel TV, the clip the man of God showed.

0:12:49.320,0:12:53.680
Some say it looks like a bird; it is not an aircraft.

0:12:53.680,0:12:58.060
But I would like to confirm it, that it was an aircraft.

0:12:58.060,0:13:00.160
We saw it; we witnessed it.

0:13:00.160,0:13:07.960
We thank God because on one of the pictures taken, the aircraft was captured.

0:13:07.960,0:13:14.960
I would like to believe it was the plan of God that pushed that excitement to take those pictures.

0:13:14.960,0:13:18.260
It was the Holy Spirit. Thank you very much.

0:13:18.260,0:13:22.520
Security footage September 12, 2014.

0:13:22.520,0:13:30.960
A strange aircraft flies low over a building at The SCOAN multiple times before the incident

0:13:30.960,0:13:36.900
and after the incident, the strange aircraft does not return.

0:13:36.900,0:13:39.680
September 12, 2014

0:13:39.680,0:13:43.460
Take note of the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

0:13:43.460,0:14:03.700
A strange aircraft flies over the building of The SCOAN before the incident at 11:30am.

0:14:03.760,0:14:29.700
Thirteen minutes later, the strange aircraft flies low over the building before the incident - 11:43am.

0:14:29.720,0:14:35.760
Just two minutes later, the strange aircraft returns and flies lower over the buildings

0:14:35.760,0:14:54.840
before the incident - 11:45am.

0:14:54.840,0:15:01.800
Nine minutes later, the strange aircraft returns and again flies low over the building

0:15:01.800,0:15:14.000
before the incident -  11:54am.

0:15:14.040,0:15:25.700
This is the moment of the incident.

0:15:25.720,0:15:30.800
After the incident, the strange aircraft does not return.

0:15:30.800,0:15:34.640
OK, thank you.

0:15:34.640,0:15:36.940
Let me continue my message.

0:15:36.940,0:15:42.140
After the fourth time, we could not see the aircraft again.

0:15:42.140,0:15:48.240
Let me read a little message for you before I bring out some details.

0:15:48.240,0:15:57.760
In this environment of Ikotun-Egbe, we have never witnessed an accident of a building collapse.

0:15:57.760,0:16:05.300
This is to tell you that we have a stable terrain in Ikotun-Egbe.

0:16:05.300,0:16:09.900
I have been in this community for the past 30 years

0:16:09.900,0:16:13.060
and there has been no record of a building collapse.

0:16:13.060,0:16:20.560
As a minister of the Gospel, our first priority is life saving.

0:16:20.560,0:16:25.880
There is no compromise in what we do at all.

0:16:25.880,0:16:31.060
I am going to leave this for you to judge.

0:16:31.060,0:16:35.540
Take note of that – I am pregnant of the word.

0:16:35.540,0:16:41.480
We have left the security to do their job.

0:16:41.480,0:16:51.620
Let us believe - take note of that - and educate our people and be alert.

0:16:51.620,0:16:53.460
Why we should believe -

0:16:53.460,0:17:02.480
so that our country will not witness a similar incident in another place.

0:17:02.480,0:17:05.580
This is not the first time.

0:17:05.580,0:17:11.540
If we believe, we will educate our people and be alert.

0:17:11.540,0:17:24.860
No matter how long a lie is sustained, the truth will some day prevail.

0:17:24.860,0:17:38.200
We should remember the militant who came with his group to this church with a bomb and he was arrested.

0:17:38.200,0:17:44.700
It was televised. Upon televising it and showing it on the screen,

0:17:44.700,0:17:49.520
all groups were saying it was a lie -

0:17:49.520,0:17:55.080
but later they discovered that it was true

0:17:55.080,0:17:59.960
because they felt their presence somewhere.

0:17:59.960,0:18:05.660
The case of the militant is still with the security.

0:18:05.660,0:18:14.520
The press men, the news all over the world said the story was false.

0:18:14.520,0:18:18.800
I know you will ask me, “Why Synagogue?”

0:18:18.800,0:18:22.960
That is the question that is going through you, “Why this church?”

0:18:22.960,0:18:30.940
Yes. Don’t forget the spiritual blessing that God has bestowed on us.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:35.220,0:18:39.880
A big head wears a large hat.

0:18:39.880,0:18:43.540
Don’t forget the ebola issue.

0:18:43.540,0:18:47.460
It was God who rescued this ministry from the issue.

0:18:47.460,0:18:49.740
They want to put the issue of ebola.

0:18:49.740,0:18:55.400
If possible, they would have taken an ebola patient and dropped it into the church.

0:18:55.400,0:19:01.560
You remember the text message you received: "Ebola is in the church - don't go there".

0:19:01.560,0:19:06.960
Cook hot water, put salt. Say: "T.B. Joshua".

0:19:06.960,0:19:09.500
You have forgotten? Don't forget.

0:19:09.500,0:19:13.640
God rescued this ministry from that.

0:19:13.640,0:19:24.500
They were trying to scare you from coming to this church.

0:19:24.560,0:19:30.320
Don’t be scared – you are not the target; I am the target.

0:19:30.320,0:19:42.400
I know my hour has not yet come.

0:19:42.400,0:19:44.980
Take note of that.

0:19:44.980,0:19:53.480
Don’t be scared – you are not the target; I am the target

0:19:53.480,0:19:56.240
and my hour has not yet come.

0:19:56.240,0:19:59.280
I have not yet finished my job.

0:19:59.280,0:20:06.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:06.420,0:20:14.960
I have not finished my job.

0:20:14.960,0:20:19.060
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:20:19.060,0:20:24.880
Don’t forget the message you have been receiving for the past two weeks.

0:20:24.880,0:20:29.300
I was talking to you in parables.

0:20:29.300,0:20:33.360
Go over the messages – you will see the picture.

0:20:33.360,0:20:41.900
When a situation like this comes, you should know how to handle it.

0:20:41.900,0:20:46.960
It has come and God is on top of the matter.

0:20:46.960,0:20:52.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:52.400,0:20:59.100
Let me remind you of what I said during last Sunday service:

0:20:59.100,0:21:10.380
that what would be happening between now would be much much greater than 10 years.

0:21:10.380,0:21:15.360
How many of you were in the service?

0:21:15.360,0:21:25.500
I want to assure you that our God will get back to them.

0:21:25.560,0:21:27.400
Listen to me.

0:21:27.400,0:21:35.080
God will get back to them – the agents of satan, and you will know when He gets back to them.

0:21:35.080,0:21:40.700
You will know.

0:21:40.700,0:21:43.660
And I'm happy that the whole thing starts here.

0:21:43.660,0:21:47.760
I will tell you the reason why I say, "The whole thing starts here".

0:21:47.760,0:21:51.380
From the beginning, it has been a battle.

0:21:51.380,0:21:58.780
If you notice, I have been talking to you for the past two weeks in parables.

0:21:58.780,0:22:07.200
I want to show you some documents here.

0:22:07.200,0:22:14.080
These documents - I think my wife just sees them now for the first time.

0:22:14.080,0:22:19.640
Only those who received it from the email department and I.

0:22:19.640,0:22:25.460
Those who received those documents, I warned them: between me and you and God.

0:22:25.460,0:22:27.740
Nobody should see these documents.

0:22:27.740,0:22:31.720
But because of what has happened, I think - I will just show you one.

0:22:31.720,0:22:32.760
Just one.

0:22:32.760,0:22:39.060
I want somebody to come out and read this document.

0:22:39.060,0:22:40.680
With the picture.

0:22:40.680,0:22:49.860
"Man of God - my name is Emmanuel Anaja. I am from Kogi state, living in Jos,

0:22:49.860,0:22:54.240
right now with my parent, who is a soldier.

0:22:54.240,0:22:56.800
I have a confession to make.

0:22:56.800,0:23:00.520
I want to give my life to Jesus Christ, our Saviour.

0:23:00.520,0:23:03.000
I am a Boko Haram member.

0:23:03.000,0:23:07.240
I came to The SCOAN to plant a bomb in the Synagogue Church Of All Nations,

0:23:07.240,0:23:10.880
but I could not do it because of God, who called you.

0:23:10.880,0:23:15.080
I went back to Jos with the bomb, which I still have with me.

0:23:15.080,0:23:19.380
Now, I want to show the whole world the God you serve.

0:23:19.380,0:23:25.120
Man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua - please talk to God for me, for the Bible says:

0:23:25.120,0:23:29.040
"Confess your sins to one another."

0:23:29.040,0:23:32.060
This is the picture of the man.

0:23:32.060,0:23:37.560
For security reasons, I think, I will not give you more than that.

0:23:37.560,0:23:41.820
This is one out of thousands.

0:23:41.820,0:23:47.080
The reason I am showing you this - for you to know the God you are serving.

0:23:47.080,0:23:51.840
God wants to reveal to you what He has been doing that you don’t know.

0:23:51.840,0:23:55.940
Probably, we may not appreciate what He has been doing.

0:23:55.940,0:24:03.420
And I know that because of what I have shown you, those who are faithless may not come here again.

0:24:03.420,0:24:08.220
If I had shown it in the past, the faithless generation might have not wanted to come.

0:24:08.220,0:24:13.420
It is not only one, two, or three.

0:24:13.420,0:24:18.580
I have picked them and I reported them to the security.

0:24:18.580,0:24:27.020
Do you know what it means for the church, you trust in so much, to show something on the screen?

0:24:27.020,0:24:29.420
You must confirm that it is true.

0:24:29.420,0:24:34.260
Because it is not normal to show something which is not true - on the screen.

0:24:34.260,0:24:38.960
I was showing it for good two months, still you were saying that it was not true.

0:24:38.960,0:24:44.280
Not until you saw their presence somewhere.

0:24:44.280,0:24:54.660
What happened – we should believe it so that we can educate our people to be alert.

0:24:54.660,0:24:57.840
If not...

0:24:57.840,0:25:06.980
I said it last time, concerning Boko Haram, what you are seeing now is not going to stop here,

0:25:06.980,0:25:19.500
but our God will get back. Maybe this will be the end of the whole thing.

0:25:19.500,0:25:28.480
I want to salute the martyrs, our people who are so faithful to God -

0:25:28.480,0:25:35.540
God’s Generals – people who know the God they are serving -

0:25:35.540,0:25:38.980
I want to salute them.

0:25:38.980,0:25:42.160
Thank you, all over the world.

0:25:42.160,0:25:44.080
I want to say,

0:25:44.080,0:25:48.780
the story we read for the past three days -

0:25:48.780,0:25:52.460
you know, I remained silent - I had to,

0:25:52.460,0:25:55.460
because I know...

0:25:55.460,0:25:57.560
My life has been like that.

0:25:57.560,0:26:04.560
Right from the beginning of my life, people were lying, but they would still come back to the truth.

0:26:04.560,0:26:06.520
My life has been like that.

0:26:06.520,0:26:13.580
And that is a good life, for people to lie against you first, before they realize the truth.

0:26:13.580,0:26:19.860
If people had realized the truth at the beginning, the story might have not started,

0:26:19.860,0:26:25.600
because there is "sorry" all over...

0:26:25.600,0:26:29.980
Here I am – I leave you for you to judge.

0:26:29.980,0:26:34.460
I am a prophet. Security has a job to do.

0:26:34.460,0:26:37.760
Thank you very much.
