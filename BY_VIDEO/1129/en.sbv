0:00:00.000,0:00:07.620
Lying down in a helpless state, this man is 
suffering from a permanent erection.

0:00:07.620,0:00:12.480
It is a physical condition that has
gone beyond his natural control.

0:00:12.480,0:00:16.440
So his parents have brought him to 
the Synagogue Church of All Nations,

0:00:16.440,0:00:20.420
seeking a divine solution. Let's hear from them.

0:00:20.420,0:00:24.840
His manhood has been erect for the past 11 days now. It cannot come down.

0:00:24.840,0:00:26.360
Ok, stand up, my friend.

0:00:26.360,0:00:31.260
T.B. Joshua instructs the man to stand up for an encounter with the Holy Spirit.

0:00:31.260,0:00:36.300
With the finger of God, the Prophet prays
 for him in the powerful name of Jesus Christ,

0:00:36.300,0:00:42.340
expelling all the shades of darkness that have caused his manhood to be permanently erect.

0:00:42.340,0:00:45.740
The Word of God is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:00:45.740,0:00:51.580
to heal you as it says in Isaiah 53:5,
"By His stripes, we are healed".

0:00:51.580,0:00:53.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:53.440,0:00:55.080
You are free!

0:00:55.080,0:00:58.780
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:00:58.780,0:01:00.860
My son is healed. Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:00.860,0:01:03.920
After receiving healing in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:01:03.920,0:01:07.580
Mr Jude Alobo came back to the 
Synagogue Church of All Nations

0:01:07.580,0:01:10.700
to testify that the permanent erection has gone,

0:01:10.700,0:01:13.400
and his manhood is now back to normal.

0:01:13.400,0:01:21.920
Before and After

0:01:21.920,0:01:27.980
Free from pain and tension, Mr Jude 
gladly shows that his manhood is normal once again.

0:01:27.980,0:01:29.140
Hallelujah!

0:01:29.140,0:01:30.780
Glory be to God!

0:01:30.780,0:01:32.540
Brother, I want you to tap your body.

0:01:32.540,0:01:36.560
Tap it with your hands. Press it. How do you feel?

0:01:36.560,0:01:39.180
I feel very good now, very fine.

0:01:39.180,0:01:41.460
Very normal now. I'm good.

0:01:41.460,0:01:44.320
Were you able to touch your private part like this before?

0:01:44.320,0:01:47.780
No, I wasn't able to do that because I was in severe pain.

0:01:47.780,0:01:50.720
The erection wouldn't let me urinate.

0:01:50.720,0:01:52.780
Right now you're touching it. What do you have to say?

0:01:52.780,0:01:56.000
I give glory to God, I give thanks to God.

0:01:56.000,0:01:58.040
Touch it once again.

0:01:58.040,0:01:59.480
You mean the pain is gone?

0:01:59.480,0:02:01.080
The pain is gone totally.

0:02:01.080,0:02:05.740
To the glory of God, we can see the brother
who suffered from permanent erection,

0:02:05.740,0:02:07.840
he couldn't pass urine then without pain.

0:02:07.840,0:02:11.140
Every time he wanted to pass urine,
he was always experiencing terrible pain.

0:02:11.140,0:02:16.200
But right now we can see him passing urine without any pain, to the glory of God.

0:02:16.200,0:02:17.960
Thank You, Jesus!

TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:22.400,0:02:25.140
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:25.140,0:02:27.660
My name is Jude Alobo.

0:02:27.660,0:02:30.500
Beside me are my mom and my dad.

0:02:30.500,0:02:34.360
I am a graduate. I'm from Benue State.

0:02:34.360,0:02:37.060
I studied building engineering at the University of Jos.

0:02:37.060,0:02:45.640
I came here because I had a permanent erection, asthma, depression and schizophrenia.

0:02:45.640,0:02:49.720
The problem started while I was in the university.

0:02:49.720,0:02:54.280
I was combining music and studies together,

0:02:54.280,0:02:57.820
but the music wasn't  forthcoming.

0:02:57.820,0:03:03.460
And I wasn't performing well in my studies 
so that led me into a depression.

0:03:03.460,0:03:15.120
I started taking drugs - marijuana and 
other drugs - and having casual sex with prostitutes.

0:03:15.120,0:03:20.440
But those drugs didn't work. Instead, they led me into illness.

0:03:20.440,0:03:25.600
I was taken to the hospital and I was
diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.

0:03:25.600,0:03:33.040
I was prescribed drugs which I was taking 
but those drugs had strong side effects

0:03:33.040,0:03:38.500
which was causing me permanent 
erection that would last for four hours.

0:03:38.500,0:03:41.160
So I decided to stop taking the drugs.

0:03:41.160,0:03:45.700
When I went back to the hospital
 for my regular check-up,

0:03:45.700,0:03:52.160
the doctor gave me an injection - a 
combination of all the drugs I was taking

0:03:52.160,0:03:57.000
which gave me a permanent 
erection that lasted for two months.

0:03:57.000,0:03:59.760
They took me to different hospitals,

0:03:59.760,0:04:02.497
different churches but the erection didn't go down.

0:04:02.497,0:04:04.839
I was in severe pain, I was in serious pain;

0:04:04.840,0:04:07.820
I couldn't stand straight, I couldn't sit 
down.

0:04:07.820,0:04:11.920
I had to lie down because the pain was so serious.

0:04:11.920,0:04:15.460
The doctor suggested I should go for an operation

0:04:15.460,0:04:18.660
which I refused because it was a 50/50 chance.

0:04:18.660,0:04:22.900
So I decided to come to the Synagogue Church of All Nations because I had seen so many people

0:04:22.900,0:04:27.020
with the same situation of permanent erection being healed here.

0:04:27.020,0:04:33.360
When I came here, the man of God prayed for me and I became healed.

0:04:33.360,0:04:37.980
The erection started going down
 gradually and the pain started subsiding

0:04:37.980,0:04:40.940
and that was how I became okay.

Mr Jude Alobo & Family
Healing Testimony

0:04:45.580,0:04:49.440
My word of advice to everyone
out there is to believe in God,

0:04:49.440,0:04:52.700
to trust in God - God is the only Healer.

0:04:52.700,0:04:57.180
Mr Jude Alobo & Family
Healing Testimony

0:04:57.180,0:05:00.920
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:05:00.920,0:05:06.180
My name is Arubi Alobo, 
just like I've been introduced.

0:05:06.180,0:05:10.020
The reason we are here today is to give testimony

0:05:10.020,0:05:13.380
regarding the permanent erection of Jude Alobo.

0:05:13.380,0:05:15.100
He has said it all.

0:05:15.100,0:05:19.760
What I want to add is that the pain he felt -

0:05:19.760,0:05:23.820
if you were there, it was like you could feel it as well.

0:05:23.820,0:05:28.640
And so I described that pain as the father of all pains

0:05:28.640,0:05:33.860
because as he was writhing in pains,
indeed all of us were always crying.

0:05:33.860,0:05:38.940
But today, we have come back here to 
tell the whole world that God is here.

0:05:38.940,0:05:44.220
That whatever problem you have, 
that this is the only place

0:05:44.220,0:05:46.560
where you can come and receive healing.

0:05:46.560,0:05:52.240
I remember, while the pain was on,
we had to visit one hospital or the other.

0:05:52.240,0:05:55.800
We went to a particular doctor and
 we told him about our condition.

0:05:55.800,0:05:58.820
He said we should try another doctor, that he could not handle it.

0:05:58.820,0:06:03.460
We went to a second doctor 
and he referred us to a hospital

0:06:03.460,0:06:06.660
where there are professionals
that could handle such a case.

0:06:06.660,0:06:09.600
When we went there, they said that 
we should go back to the hospital

0:06:09.600,0:06:12.840
where the whole thing started
and when we went to that very hospital,

0:06:12.840,0:06:16.060
the doctors said he would go through an operation -

0:06:16.060,0:06:19.280
an operation of which they said that it would be 50/50.

0:06:19.280,0:06:26.920
As he was not ready to go through such a thing, from there we drove straight to this place.

0:06:26.920,0:06:32.180
Right from the hospital, we came over to this place and here he received his healing.

0:06:32.180,0:06:35.320
And today he is well.

0:06:35.320,0:06:37.840
People of God, praise the Lord!

0:06:37.840,0:06:39.640
Hallelujah!

0:06:39.640,0:06:44.860
My advice to the whole world is that 
we should always listen to the voice of the Lord.

0:06:44.860,0:06:48.380
The voice of the Lord may not
 be very clear to us at times,

0:06:48.380,0:06:53.440
but we have to be very careful to 
be able to discern when God is talking to us

0:06:53.440,0:06:55.820
so that we will follow the right path.

0:06:55.820,0:06:59.780
Testimony Time

0:06:59.780,0:07:04.000
My name is Alobo Roselyn.

0:07:04.000,0:07:07.500
When it started, we were all confused.

0:07:07.500,0:07:12.360
As a mother, the pain that your
son or daughter is going through -

0:07:12.360,0:07:16.500
you know that it touches a mother.

0:07:16.500,0:07:22.840
I cannot even count the tears I shed.

0:07:22.840,0:07:25.240
But I said, "God, you are there".

0:07:25.240,0:07:29.260
I have been watching Emmanuel TV for years now.

0:07:29.260,0:07:32.820
I said, "What He is doing for others,
He is going to do for me.

0:07:32.820,0:07:36.940
I'm not going to allow my son
 to enter the theater for the operation.

0:07:36.940,0:07:40.420
I'm coming down here for his healing".

0:07:40.420,0:07:45.940
And my son, with his own belief, said that he will never enter the theater,

0:07:45.940,0:07:50.440
that he's coming down here, that God of T.B. Joshua will do it for him.

0:07:50.440,0:07:54.480
With his own belief and the trust we had in God,

0:07:54.480,0:07:59.660
we entered a vehicle from 
Jos and came down to the arena of liberty.

0:07:59.660,0:08:02.160
I was happy when I entered the arena of liberty.

0:08:02.160,0:08:05.600
I said, "Yes, my God will do it for me now".

0:08:05.600,0:08:10.040
Immediately the man of God touched 
my son, the pain was released.

0:08:10.040,0:08:14.240
He could not sit down, he could not lie 
down. Even to lie down was a problem.

0:08:14.240,0:08:17.260
As a mother, I was crying all the time.

0:08:17.260,0:08:19.700
So the whole thing just came down.

0:08:19.700,0:08:22.500
I thank God, I glorify His name!

0:08:22.500,0:08:25.300
Amen.

0:08:25.300,0:08:26.900
To God be the glory.

0:08:26.900,0:08:31.220
The advice I have for people all
over the world as a mother:

0:08:31.220,0:08:37.760
If your son is going through pain,
just have patience and trust in God.

0:08:37.760,0:08:41.400
Call on God and He is going to rescue you from that pain.
