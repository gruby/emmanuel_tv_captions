Viewers all over the world,

0:00:06.400,0:00:14.400
faith releases healing anointing.

0:00:14.400,0:00:24.340
Faith releases blessing and deliverance.

0:00:24.340,0:00:30.920
It is time to build yourself for the journey.

0:00:30.920,0:00:40.440
Walking with the Lord - you need faith to walk with the Lord.

0:00:40.440,0:00:50.400
Whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God -

0:00:50.400,0:01:00.800
the barrier could be pain of the past, bitterness, jealousy, envy, hatred or grief.

0:01:00.800,0:01:08.100
Whatever satan uses to connect you to himself -

0:01:08.100,0:01:11.840
he uses our barrier to connect us to himself.

0:01:11.840,0:01:14.560
He uses offence to connect us to himself.

0:01:14.560,0:01:24.600
He uses grief, strife, resentment to connect us to himself.

0:01:24.600,0:01:31.260
Whatever satan might have used to connect us to himself, begin to disconnect it!

0:01:31.260,0:01:33.740
Disconnect yourself right now!

0:01:33.740,0:01:43.780
That offence, be cursed, be removed!

0:01:43.780,0:01:52.520
I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:52.520,0:02:01.160
Be free!

0:02:01.160,0:02:02.700
Say after me,

0:02:02.700,0:02:16.780
"Take more of me, oh Lord; give me more of You - more of Your purity, Your holiness, Your faithfulness,

0:02:16.780,0:02:25.720
Your humility, Your obedience, in Jesus' name!"

0:02:25.720,0:02:27.860
Rejoice!

0:02:27.860,0:02:31.400
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
