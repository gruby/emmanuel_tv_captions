0:00:00.000,0:00:10.480
There is a brother there - tall; towards the end of this row,

0:00:10.480,0:00:13.960
Just raise up your hand.

0:00:14.040,0:00:16.060
Can I speak to you sir ?

0:00:16.580,0:00:17.740
Yes, sir

0:00:17.740,0:00:20.560
There is a charm you are carrying up and down.

0:00:20.560,0:00:22.180
Can you go get the charm ?

0:00:22.180,0:00:22.900
Yes. Sir.

0:00:28.660,0:00:34.600
Outside one of the entrances to the SCOAN

0:00:38.200,0:00:40.200
Narration in French

0:00:42.580,0:00:44.000
You are a witch doctor.

0:00:44.000,0:00:44.560
Yes.

0:00:44.560,0:00:45.940
People consult you.

0:00:45.940,0:00:46.900
Yes. Sir.

0:00:46.900,0:00:50.500
I am seeing this thing appears. A human being appears to you every night

0:00:50.500,0:00:51.500
Yes.

0:00:51.540,0:00:53.680
They surround you and they want to kill you.

0:00:53.680,0:00:56.460
Yes. Sir. They used to eat with me.

0:00:56.460,0:00:59.900
And at times my wife would ask, 'what is that ?' I would say nothing.

0:01:01.300,0:01:05.520
I used to prepare some charms for people.

0:01:05.560,0:01:11.200
If a costomer comes to me and asks me for something, I would ask them

0:01:11.200,0:01:14.020
for the kind of charm. They would then explain themselves.

0:01:14.020,0:01:17.780
The items here have something I normally serve.

0:01:17.780,0:01:19.720
And I would serve it to them.

0:01:19.720,0:01:25.040
They would go to the place, everything would be as required, as needed.

0:01:25.140,0:01:28.280
This charm needed blood from me but I said I did not have blood

0:01:28.280,0:01:32.100
to give it to him. I don't want to serve him anymore.

0:01:32.220,0:01:36.780
Listen to me and confirm my words. Not that your don't want to serve him anymore.

0:01:36.940,0:01:40.500
Human beings appeared to you and said they wanted to kill you.

0:01:40.500,0:01:44.400
If not that they came to you physically that they wanted to kill you. You would not come out.

0:01:44.400,0:01:45.220
Yes. Sir.

0:01:54.620,0:01:56.620
You know you used to shout in the night ? You cry out ?

0:01:56.620,0:02:01.580
Yes sir. Sometimes, if I was in bed. The man would come

0:02:01.780,0:02:05.500
In a white Mercedes-Benz, wearing dreadlocks. He would wake me up.

0:02:05.500,0:02:08.000
Ask me to sit down and that he wanted to eat.

0:02:08.000,0:02:12.220
He said he needed blood, meaning he wanted to kill me.

0:02:12.540,0:02:14.540
He said he needed blood. Yes.

0:02:15.000,0:02:21.760
Can you address the people of God about the failure of this business.

0:02:22.000,0:02:26.140
The need to Jesus as our Lord and Savior.

0:02:26.700,0:02:32.760
Please viewers, I beg you all, this way is not a real way.

0:02:33.000,0:02:38.960
Follow Jesus Christ as the ultimate.

0:02:39.200,0:02:41.500
You became a preacher now !

0:02:41.500,0:02:42.500
No, no sir

0:02:45.780,0:02:52.220
I want to advise all the men.... this is your wife ? Yes, Sir

0:02:52.220,0:02:58.940
Can you tell us how he behaves at night when these people come ?

0:02:58.940,0:03:08.500
Since I married my husband almost 17 years ago. I was 18 at the time.

0:03:08.500,0:03:21.500
He would carry a little stick with a hole in it. He would place it on the floor and serve it.

0:03:21.500,0:03:28.500
And name it Ogbu and serve it with the blood of a fowl killed for that purpose.

0:03:28.500,0:03:36.000
He would plead with the Ogbu to save all members of the family.

0:03:36.000,0:03:41.220
And that word always touches my heart because if I ask my husband to

0:03:41.220,0:03:49.180
Surrender his life to Christ. I would not know his reaction. So I always prayed everyday.

0:03:49.180,0:03:58.640
Sometimes, when the children and I were asleep, I would hear his voice anc would be shocked.

0:03:58.980,0:04:01.740
I would hear my husband's voice in the midnight...

0:04:01.740,0:04:02.940
Shouting.

0:04:02.940,0:04:07.140
He would shout and be discussing as if there were someone with him.

0:04:07.140,0:04:09.260
How many of them are always with you ?

0:04:09.320,0:04:13.720
They can be 5 or 6, and they would surround me.

0:04:13.820,0:04:17.920
They are spiritual people, not the real people. Sir.

0:04:26.660,0:04:32.480
I would wake up from my sleep around 2 or 3 am and ask my husband,

0:04:32.480,0:04:35.700
Who were those people your were discussing with ?

0:04:35.700,0:04:37.040
In the middle of the night.

0:04:37.040,0:04:40.200
He has different types of juju (charm).

0:04:40.200,0:04:41.800
In the house.

0:04:41.800,0:04:48.620
Yes. One is Ogbu. One is Iroko. There are different names.

0:04:48.620,0:04:53.720
So, I asked my husband, 'Who are you talking to ?'

0:04:53.720,0:04:58.360
He told me they were those charms (juju). They wanted to take his life.

0:04:58.360,0:05:03.580
Because they needed blood. I then told my husband that we should pray.

0:05:03.580,0:05:06.820
We should pray. And take these things to church.

0:05:06.840,0:05:11.460
My husband then said to me, if these things (items) were taken to church.

0:05:11.460,0:05:16.440
How would he make money to feed me and my children ?

0:05:16.520,0:05:21.160
Can you see the problem you have been in for long ?

0:05:21.160,0:05:26.720
You keep crying and praying and you have given your life to Jesus.

0:05:26.720,0:05:32.260
But your daily bread comes from charms.

0:05:35.520,0:05:40.700
Your children, yourself, everybody have been affected.

0:05:42.860,0:05:46.840
Now there was a marriage. A woman that came to you.

0:05:46.840,0:05:49.940
And demanded for a charm.

0:05:49.980,0:05:54.880
Because her husband married another wife.

0:05:54.880,0:05:57.260
She is light in complexion.

0:05:57.260,0:06:01.840
You gave her this charm, and the charm worked badly.

0:06:01.840,0:06:03.220
Yes.

0:06:03.220,0:06:05.360
It affected the man.

0:06:05.360,0:06:06.760
You are right. Sir.

0:06:08.640,0:06:11.480
I am just telling you one of the things he has done.

0:06:11.640,0:06:13.640
Just one of the thousands.

0:06:14.380,0:06:17.180
We have many questions to ask you !

0:06:17.180,0:06:19.960
Which we will leave it till next Sunday!

0:06:19.960,0:06:22.580
Ok, I will receive you as my guests.

0:06:23.000,0:06:27.040
Your family, your children, you go ahead and bring them for deliverance.

0:06:27.040,0:06:30.460
Your home too, we'll go there. Make sure we pack everything.

0:06:30.460,0:06:35.140
There is another charm in your house, in the form of white calabash.

0:06:36.960,0:06:39.060
Yes. That one. I am afraid to carry.

0:06:39.060,0:06:44.380
The real one that can draw the evil agents is the one in the white calabash.

0:06:45.640,0:06:47.360
Yes sir, you are right.

0:06:54.940,0:06:59.760
Without prophetic gift and you confront this person

0:06:59.760,0:07:02.080
He will fight you over.

0:07:02.080,0:07:05.360
What he put down is still a test.

0:07:05.700,0:07:11.280
If he realize that I could not probe the issue forward, he will fight back.

0:07:16.960,0:07:19.320
The real issue is at home.

0:07:19.320,0:07:22.340
He prepared that char for N400,000.

0:07:22.340,0:07:27.900
There's a pigeon that used to fly out and back.

0:07:28.740,0:07:30.000
Yes.

0:07:30.500,0:07:32.500
Can you bring these things out.

0:07:33.040,0:07:36.500
The man is asked to bring out what is in the plastic bag.

0:07:36.820,0:07:42.700
His wife confirmed that the husband has many charms, different ones, and shrine.

0:07:43.200,0:07:49.580
There is a particular one that he used to pray to, and he killed a fowl for the blood to sacrifice to

0:07:49.820,0:07:54.020
The wife advised the husband several times to give up the charm, he would not listen.

0:07:55.100,0:07:57.020
Return them back to the bag.

0:08:02.440,0:08:05.420
Watch your screen, the man is packing back his charms.

0:08:08.360,0:08:11.840
Following the prophecy on Sunday concerning his life,

0:08:12.260,0:08:17.600
Mr Segun Maku was given Anointing Water by Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:08:17.880,0:08:21.660
to go and bring the charm he had left at home.

0:08:22.180,0:08:25.960
Mr Maku together with a member of The Emmanuel TV team.

0:08:26.060,0:08:29.640
board the bus outside the SCOAN.

0:08:30.000,0:08:36.200
They are on their way to get the charm that Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied about on Sunday.

0:08:39.820,0:08:42.540
They arrived outside the house of Mr Maku

0:08:43.380,0:08:47.440
Disembarking, they enter the house where the charm is kept.

0:08:48.000,0:08:49.520
You are inside my room.

0:08:49.660,0:08:52.000
My name is Segun Maku.

0:08:52.480,0:08:58.860
This Anointing water for salvation, healing and deliverance -

0:08:59.040,0:09:02.960
he said that I should go and spray it on the charm and then carry the charm.

0:09:02.960,0:09:06.700
The charm is inside my room there. I am afraid to go there.

0:09:07.720,0:09:10.760
Mr Maku leads the team into his bedroom.

0:09:11.720,0:09:14.080
The charm is inside the box there.

0:09:14.080,0:09:19.060
This charm is very powerful. It can kill somebody ; it can even kill me.

0:09:19.080,0:09:21.820
I put the TV on top so that if somebody comes to my house.

0:09:21.880,0:09:24.040
they will not see anything, it's only the TV that they will see.

0:09:24.240,0:09:28.540
Mr Segun Maku brings out the bottle of the anointing water

0:09:28.740,0:09:37.720
In the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ.

0:09:38.020,0:09:40.680
Mr Maku takes the Television off the box.

0:09:41.120,0:09:46.320
Again spraying the anointing water for salvation, healing, and deliverance.

0:09:46.320,0:09:49.360
He causiously opens the box.

0:09:49.580,0:09:52.660
The demon there is very powerful.

0:09:52.680,0:09:56.720
In the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ.

0:09:57.020,0:10:00.280
Inside the box, is the pigeon and the white pot

0:10:00.280,0:10:05.680
containing the powerful charm the man of God prophesied about during the Sunday Service.

0:10:11.520,0:10:17.160
In the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ.

0:10:17.580,0:10:20.460
After the anointing water once again.

0:10:20.660,0:10:28.160
Mr Maku reaches out his hand to take the pigeon and the white pot containing the powerful charm out of the box.

0:10:28.940,0:10:31.260
This is the pigeon the man of God was talking about.

0:10:31.280,0:10:34.800
And this is the white bowl the man of God was talking about.

0:10:34.940,0:10:38.780
This pigeon, if somebody sees it, they will think that it's an ordinary pigeon.

0:10:38.780,0:10:41.340
It's not a pigeon; it's a demon.

0:10:41.820,0:10:45.820
This soap - if somebody came to me that they want to harm a human being,

0:10:45.920,0:10:49.520
I have a special bucket here and a special sponge.

0:10:49.740,0:10:51.780
that I will bath with.

0:10:52.180,0:10:54.660
This is the bucket, and this is the sponge.

0:10:55.300,0:10:59.220
I use it with that charm that will disfigure a human being's life.

0:10:59.660,0:11:04.080
I will tell the person to write the name of the person and

0:11:04.360,0:11:07.240
what he wants me to do to the person.

0:11:07.320,0:11:10.820
After writing it, I will use the soap to bathe.

0:11:11.000,0:11:15.700
After using it to bathe, the paper that he wrote his request on,

0:11:15.700,0:11:21.320
I will put it in the claws or the mouth of the pigeon and it will fly

0:11:21.360,0:11:24.640
and land on the roof of the person's house.

0:11:24.660,0:11:27.900
The next day, that evil will happen to the person.

0:11:28.000,0:11:32.380
The pigeon will come back to me; even if I am not around, it will wait for me.

0:11:32.460,0:11:35.580
If somebody sees the pigeon, they will think that it's an ordinary pigeon.

0:11:35.740,0:11:38.860
They won't know that it's a demon.

0:11:38.980,0:11:41.280
I can use it any way I want.

0:11:41.360,0:11:45.960
If it is blindness that he requests for the person.

0:11:46.240,0:11:50.100
The reason I was able to carry the pigeon and the bowl like this

0:11:50.200,0:11:55.580
is because of the Anointing Water. It gave me the power to carry it.

0:11:55.700,0:11:59.040
If not for the Anointing Water, I wouldn't be able to go near it

0:11:59.180,0:12:02.280
because it usually appears to me physically like a human being.

0:12:02.480,0:12:04.980
It wants to take my life but I don't want to die.

0:12:05.380,0:12:09.100
My father taught me all these things.

0:12:09.120,0:12:12.060
That was the work my father was doing before he handed it over to me.

0:12:12.180,0:12:15.660
I have to bathe before I even touch the charm,

0:12:15.700,0:12:17.820
before I use it to perform anything.

0:12:19.720,0:12:20.860
This thing is very powerful.

0:12:20.860,0:12:25.060
I can even send this bird to London - it will go and come back.

0:12:25.260,0:12:28.560
I get paid N400,000 to prepare this charm.

0:12:28.800,0:12:31.220
And now, the charm wants to kill me.

0:12:31.520,0:12:34.900
It used to appear to me face to face that it needs blood.

0:12:35.080,0:12:42.500
Sometimes, it will come with 6 members in a white vehicle, Mercedes-Benz;

0:12:42.580,0:12:45.200
they will come and request that they need blood.

0:12:45.500,0:12:48.940
If not for the Anointing Water, I would not even be able to touh or...

0:12:48.940,0:12:50.640
hold it like this.

0:12:50.840,0:12:55.160
Mr Maku begins to pack the bucket and sponge that he used to use.

0:12:55.200,0:12:59.300
together with the charm to take them to the SCOAN.

0:12:59.420,0:13:03.020
This demon - it's over three years, since it's been on top of that table there.

0:13:03.460,0:13:11.160
Mr Segun Maku once sprays the Anointing Water over the cardboard box containing the charm and pigeon.

0:13:11.980,0:13:13.980
He then carrys it out of his house.

0:13:14.200,0:13:19.280
And boards the vehicle waiting to take him to SCOAN.

0:13:21.740,0:13:26.620
Mr Segun Maku arrives safely to the SCOAN.

0:13:27.040,0:13:30.380
And make his way inside the church walkway.

0:13:46.660,0:13:49.540
Here is the man, the wife, and his children.

0:13:50.080,0:13:53.500
Man of God the charms are outside there,

0:13:53.500,0:13:55.340
I went home and brought them.

0:13:57.840,0:14:03.380
Mr Segun Maku said that he kept the charms outside the church auditorium.

0:14:03.600,0:14:06.160
Now that he moves to got and get them.

0:14:07.460,0:14:11.240
Going outside the church, we can see him at the back of a car,

0:14:11.340,0:14:15.800
When he brings out the carrier bag, and 2 cardboard boxes.

0:14:15.800,0:14:21.080
which contain the charms and diabolic items of his witch doctor's trait

0:14:22.060,0:14:28.560
Mr Segun Maku carries the boxes and the carrier bag containing all his charms

0:14:28.560,0:14:34.140
back towards the church building. So that he can finally be set free.

0:14:34.760,0:14:40.040
He enters into the SCOAN auditorium, and asisted by his wife.

0:14:40.340,0:14:43.140
He walkes back to his position by the altar.

0:14:43.180,0:14:46.660
and places the item on the floor, before the altar.

0:14:50.420,0:14:54.600
Next, he spreads out a filthy cloth on the floor

0:14:54.600,0:14:58.340
before bring each of the charms out of their containers

0:14:58.700,0:15:05.460
Mr Maku brings out many dirty charms, and objects including a grimy little padlock.

0:15:07.040,0:15:12.140
This is the pigeon and white pot the man of God had prophesied about last Sunday

0:15:13.360,0:15:17.140
This is the special bucket and sponge used in the ritual.

0:15:18.140,0:15:20.520
He brings out the wash bowl and sponge

0:15:20.700,0:15:24.320
At where we are, remain quiet, as we are about to listen to him.

0:15:24.580,0:15:25.520
explain !

0:15:26.600,0:15:29.120
The harms he has done to people with his charms.

0:15:29.740,0:15:33.320
and what the charms have caused in the lives of people.

0:15:33.400,0:15:36.900
We are seeing what is diplayed on the floor.

0:16:04.800,0:16:12.400
My name is Segu Maku. I worked in Benin as a transporter.

0:16:12.420,0:16:20.440
My father sent for me to come and meet him; he was a strong herbalist.

0:16:20.480,0:16:26.200
My father handed over all these charms and herbalist  items to me.

0:16:26.260,0:16:30.180
saying that I should take over the work of a herbalist.

0:16:30.260,0:16:32.260
So, he gave everything to me.

0:16:32.340,0:16:37.220
I went to Edo State to start practising how to make charms.

0:16:37.460,0:16:41.860
People come to ask me to prepare charms for them.

0:16:43.500,0:16:49.800
When they come to me, I will tell them to write their opponent's name.

0:16:49.820,0:16:53.780
They will write the name and the residential address of the person.

0:16:53.860,0:16:58.220
I would first use this soap that I prepared to bathe.

0:16:59.780,0:17:04.760
This is the white bowl the man of God prophesied about last Sunday service.

0:17:04.980,0:17:06.980
It's very powerful.

0:17:08.100,0:17:13.220
This is the white bowl the man of God prophesied about during last Sunday service.

0:17:13.320,0:17:17.600
That Mr. Maku had left at home because he was afraid to touch it.

0:17:17.820,0:17:21.000
How do the soap and pigeon work together ?

0:17:21.000,0:17:22.460
Tell us the work.

0:17:24.120,0:17:28.820
I prepared the soap, if I want to use the soap with the pigeon.

0:17:28.860,0:17:35.200
I will use the soap to bathe with my special sponge and bucket.

0:17:35.200,0:17:38.700
This is the bucket.

0:17:39.200,0:17:43.680
After bathing with the special soa[, sponge and bucket,

0:17:43.760,0:17:48.200
I would put the name that was given to me in the pigeon's claws or mouth.

0:17:48.240,0:17:53.700
I would then command the pigeon to do the job and come back.

0:17:53.860,0:18:01.060
And then, the pigeon will fly to the address that was put in its claws

0:18:01.120,0:18:05.020
The pigeon would drop the paper on the roof of the person, then come back.

0:18:05.180,0:18:07.180
Before daybreak, the job would be done.

0:18:08.120,0:18:11.760
He mentioned earlier, the soap and pigeon work together.

0:18:11.980,0:18:17.700
He said that the first thing that he would do is to bathe with the soap in the white bowl.

0:18:17.980,0:18:23.560
Then he will go to the pigeon to command it to go and destroy.

0:18:23.740,0:18:27.460
If any customer came to him, saying that he wanted to hurt someone.

0:18:27.880,0:18:32.180
Mr. Segu Maku would ask them to write the person's name and address.

0:18:32.340,0:18:35.680
and what they wanted to happen to the person in question.

0:18:36.260,0:18:44.260
Then, he would put the paper in the pigeon's beak or claws and commanded it to go and complete the task.

0:18:45.440,0:18:50.340
He added that the pigeon would immediately fly to the roof of the person's house.

0:18:50.500,0:18:53.120
and drop the paper on their roof.

0:18:53.360,0:18:58.600
By morning, whatever the customer had requested would have happened.

0:18:58.940,0:19:06.800
Then the pigeon would fly back to him, to report his success speaking with a human voice, only he could hear.

0:19:07.260,0:19:09.480
What are the kinds of the jobs you normally send the pigeon to do ?

0:19:09.480,0:19:13.640
I used to send it to cause someone to have a stroke.

0:19:13.760,0:19:19.160
It can cause somebody to have a stroke, It does as I command.

0:19:19.220,0:19:24.300
I can send it to London or anywhere; it will return and give me the feedback.

0:19:24.480,0:19:26.760
I can cause someone to have a mental illness.

0:19:26.840,0:19:30.960
Or whatever the costomer requests.

0:19:31.600,0:19:35.820
Mr. Maku said that the pigeon could be used to make someone to have a mental disorder.

0:19:35.840,0:19:41.500
To cause stroke, to maim or to do any evil thing that he wanted to happen.

0:19:41.820,0:19:47.180
All he had to do was to command the pigeon, and it would carry out his order.

0:19:47.980,0:19:54.140
Mr. Segu Maku then said, that the pigeon could go anywhere, to any country, all across the world.

0:19:54.380,0:20:01.420
If any woman wants a husband or wants to collect money from the man's hands.

0:20:01.440,0:20:11.680
Firstly, I would tell the woman to get a bitter kola, swallow it and excrete it.

0:20:11.680,0:20:17.620
I would look for a special rope that we use for this job and take the bitter kola.

0:20:17.620,0:20:25.480
I would ask the woman for some of her pubic hair, finger nails, hair from...

0:20:25.540,0:20:30.500
her armpits and a native pot.

0:20:30.540,0:20:34.720
I would prepare the concoction. I would ask the woman

0:20:34.720,0:20:40.300
what she wants to happen to the person.

0:20:40.380,0:20:46.300
If she puts it in his food or soft drink and the man eats it or drink it.

0:20:46.300,0:20:51.520
whatever she has asked for would be done for her.

0:20:51.520,0:20:55.020
It is a command and so it shall remain in the life of the person forever.

0:20:55.120,0:21:01.300
I can send the pigeon to any country - Nigeria or even London.

0:21:01.320,0:21:04.340
Have you sent the pigeon to London before ?

0:21:05.880,0:21:08.740
I sent this to ....uh

0:21:12.760,0:21:15.920
He has sent the pigeon to London before.

0:21:15.920,0:21:17.340
He sent it out to London !

0:21:17.460,0:21:19.760
The wife is confirming it.

0:21:21.700,0:21:23.700
I have sent this pigeon to Italy.

0:21:23.780,0:21:30.160
One woman gave me the job that her husband disappointed her,

0:21:30.520,0:21:34.040
So, I sent the pigeon there to do the job.

0:21:34.660,0:21:38.560
He had sent the pigeon to London and Italy in the past.

0:21:39.120,0:21:46.020
There was one particular woman, who said that the man had disappointed her, and she wanted him to be destroyed.

0:21:46.020,0:21:51.300
Mr. Segu Maku send the pigeon to Italy, and the man was indeed destroyed.

0:21:51.560,0:21:55.860
Whenever I send the pigeon to do a bad job, when it comes back,

0:21:55.920,0:22:02.060
it would talk to me physically. Nobody else would know what the pigeon is saying.

0:22:02.280,0:22:04.540
I can also send the pigeon to cause an accident.

0:22:04.600,0:22:08.300
What is it again ? There is no destruction the pigeon cannot do.

0:22:09.680,0:22:17.780
You have to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.

0:22:17.820,0:22:22.100
I am ready to accept Jesus Christ today as my Saviour.

0:22:22.100,0:22:28.840
Do you have people that you have chained or tied down with this charm ?

0:22:28.960,0:22:31.760
Many people, sir.

0:22:31.760,0:22:38.900
I have much work at hand that people have already paid me to do, but

0:22:38.920,0:22:44.360
I will drop it now because I want to give my life to Christ.

0:22:45.460,0:22:50.980
The man of God asked Mr Segu Maku if he had tied any one down by his charms and practices ?

0:22:50.980,0:22:55.620
To which he answered yes, "Many are tied down till this moment".

0:22:55.660,0:23:00.280
And he has collected money from several people to do other jobs for them.

0:23:00.280,0:23:05.540
But, he has abandon all of them, because he wants to give his life to Christ.

0:23:05.540,0:23:07.360
You have any question any where ?

0:23:07.940,0:23:09.480
The woman please come....

0:23:19.760,0:23:21.220
Emmanuel !

0:23:21.680,0:23:25.860
My name is Florence Alumona.

0:23:26.100,0:23:30.200
Dose he kill people that have Jesus - a born-again Christian ?

0:23:30.200,0:23:31.480
Clap for her !

0:23:36.840,0:23:42.380
The woman was asking you what about a born again Christian ?

0:23:42.680,0:23:47.940
With the born-again Christians, it's quite different. Some people go to church.

0:23:47.940,0:23:49.860
but also patronise herbalists

0:23:49.900,0:23:57.860
But if it is a true Christian, the pigeon will come back and

0:23:57.860,0:24:02.460
say that it does not have the power to kill the born again Christian.

0:24:10.820,0:24:12.680
This is why we ask the question.

0:24:12.920,0:24:16.560
Those of you that go to church and still go to witch doctor,

0:24:16.820,0:24:19.580
if they don't catch you !

0:24:23.900,0:24:30.020
The belief of many is that the pigwon needs to be burnt.

0:24:30.080,0:24:41.040
If you burn the pigeon, the demon in it will go out but you only burn its flesh.

0:24:41.640,0:24:46.100
The answer is deliverance and let the pigeon continue to live.

0:24:46.300,0:24:50.800
He will be delivered and the wife also will be delivered.

0:24:50.900,0:24:58.040
You said there is a man that comes to you physically. With which vehicle ?

0:24:58.080,0:25:02.600
A white Mercedes Benz and he appears wearing dreadlocks.

0:25:02.720,0:25:07.440
The man looks like a human being but he is a ghost.

0:25:07.620,0:25:12.420
He came to me and said that he needs my blood.

0:25:12.540,0:25:16.240
You cannot estimate the number of people you have destroyed.

0:25:16.300,0:25:18.300
I cannot count how many people.

0:25:18.560,0:25:22.420
because anybody would pay, I would do the job.

0:25:22.420,0:25:26.400
I have been doing it for 20 years.

0:25:28.300,0:25:30.960
I will deliver you and I will deliver the pigeon at the same time.

0:25:32.920,0:25:34.400
I don't need to go and touch it.

0:25:37.040,0:25:40.160
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ !

0:25:42.280,0:25:43.920
Holy Ghost Fire !

0:25:53.900,0:25:58.140
The power of the Holy Spirit blew Mr Segu Maku off his feet.

0:25:58.220,0:26:02.520
Now under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, he is been disconnected

0:26:02.520,0:26:06.640
from every chain satan had used to connect him to himself.

0:26:07.500,0:26:11.180
They are receiving deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:26:11.500,0:26:14.620
Both Mr Maku and his pigeon.

0:26:22.100,0:26:23.760
Thank you Lord, they are free.

0:26:24.200,0:26:26.200
Glory be to God !

0:26:33.360,0:26:35.340
You are seeing the pigeon !

0:26:51.100,0:26:56.000
The name Jesus brings light where there is darkness.

0:26:57.260,0:27:01.740
The name Jesus brings understanding where there is ignorance.

0:27:03.020,0:27:07.900
The name Jesus brings awareness of righteousness where there is sin.

0:27:08.880,0:27:13.780
The name Jesus brings joy where there is sadness.

0:27:23.160,0:27:24.360
above all !

0:27:28.400,0:27:30.640
Contentment !

0:27:33.500,0:27:36.160
Give him the mic let him call the name of Jesus, see what would happen to him ?

0:27:36.820,0:27:39.220
Jesus

0:27:43.420,0:27:45.420
See what is happening to him ?

0:27:46.740,0:27:50.720
By calling the name Jesus Christ, you can see him shaking, right now ...

0:27:50.860,0:27:52.520
Down he goes !

0:28:00.680,0:28:02.580
That is one of his children crying !

0:28:13.080,0:28:16.420
If you agree with me that Jesus is greater than your knees, let me see your hand.

0:28:22.280,0:28:25.560
This padlock is used when he'd mention people's name and lock it.

0:28:25.620,0:28:28.980
We are going to loosen the padlock now so the people can be free.

0:28:35.960,0:28:38.920
1200 people's names

0:28:42.440,0:28:45.340
I will personally open it myself.

0:28:58.180,0:29:00.820
1200 people have just been unlocked,

0:29:00.820,0:29:04.280
from the bondage they have been feeling for years.

0:29:04.300,0:29:09.240
The man of God directed by the Spirit of God, unlocked the evil that this witch doctor has done

0:29:09.240,0:29:11.880
with this padlock that we are seeing right there.

0:29:12.060,0:29:19.160
The man of God directed by the Spirit of God just released 1200 people who were locked in bondage.

0:29:19.280,0:29:23.860
Man of God, what you said about the padlock is true.

0:29:24.100,0:29:29.620
My husband used it to lock people's destinies - thousands of people

0:29:29.900,0:29:31.900
A lot of people are getting free now.

0:29:31.920,0:29:36.500
But they don't know how the freedom came.

0:29:46.060,0:29:47.240
Come !

0:29:53.780,0:29:55.460
Who is a new comer here ?

0:30:00.120,0:30:05.100
In the name of Jesus, just speak ! To her. See what happen ?

0:30:05.800,0:30:10.980
The man is a new comer, he has been called out among the new comers to go forward...

0:30:11.400,0:30:13.740
He will use the mighty power in the name of Jesus.

0:30:14.220,0:30:15.900
In the name of Jesus.

0:30:17.120,0:30:18.700
In the name of Jesus.

0:30:19.280,0:30:20.780
Down she goes !

0:30:21.240,0:30:23.120
In the mighty power of the name of Jesus.

0:30:33.960,0:30:38.320
I am very surprised, and surprise again. I am very happy.

0:30:38.600,0:30:42.340
The need for you to live for God.

0:30:42.700,0:30:44.380
Stop sinning.

0:30:45.200,0:30:50.120
The name Jesus brings light where there is darkness.

0:30:51.220,0:30:55.940
The name Jesus brings understanding where there is ignorance.

0:30:57.040,0:31:02.140
The name Jesus brings awareness of righteousness where there is sin.

0:31:02.760,0:31:07.980
The name Jesus brings joy where there is sadness.

0:31:17.380,0:31:18.880
Above all..

0:31:22.620,0:31:24.140
Contentment !

0:31:29.240,0:31:36.640
Testimony Time

0:31:37.260,0:31:43.460
After Mr Maku's deliverance, he is presented with cash gift of N300.000.

0:31:43.460,0:31:45.020
And a Holy Bible.

0:31:45.120,0:31:49.700
To further asist Mr Maku and his family as a platform to start a business.

0:31:50.020,0:31:54.520
So that he won't go back to his former way of life to make ends meet.

0:31:55.220,0:31:57.580
My name is Segun Maku.

0:31:57.720,0:32:05.960
This woman is my wife. There are my sons and my daughters.

0:32:06.120,0:32:11.680
The moment I came to The SCOAN, I knew that God is existing here.

0:32:11.680,0:32:16.580
to make my life change from worst to good.

0:32:16.700,0:32:19.000
I thank God for my life today.

0:32:20.700,0:32:24.000
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ !

0:32:25.960,0:32:28.100
Holy Ghost Fire !

0:32:37.780,0:32:41.740
The power of the Holy Spirit blew Mr Maku off his feet.

0:32:41.960,0:32:46.140
Now under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, he is been disconnected

0:32:46.140,0:32:50.400
from every chain satan had used to connect him to himself.

0:32:51.020,0:32:52.780
That really delivered me.

0:32:52.780,0:32:57.900
The monent I was delivered, something came out of my body.

0:32:57.920,0:33:01.480
That was the evil power of the charm.

0:33:01.620,0:33:03.780
Let him call the name of Jesus, see what will happen to him.

0:33:04.500,0:33:06.800
Jesus !

0:33:11.320,0:33:13.320
See what is happening to him ?

0:33:14.180,0:33:18.620
By calling the name of Jesus Christ, you can see him shaking uncontrollably.

0:33:18.620,0:33:20.340
Down he goes !

0:33:23.300,0:33:26.060
Jesus is very great ! Now, I am a free man.

0:33:26.060,0:33:28.020
I don't see anything anymore.

0:33:28.100,0:33:31.460
If I sleep at night now, I sleep like a young man,

0:33:31.860,0:33:39.620
I am a free man ; my body is very free.

0:33:39.820,0:33:42.240
Let him call the name of Jesus, see what will happen to him ?

0:33:42.740,0:33:45.120
Jesus !

0:33:49.620,0:33:51.420
See what is happening to him ?

0:33:52.520,0:33:56.680
By calling the name of Jesus Christ, you can see him shaking uncontrollably.

0:33:56.680,0:33:58.460
Down he goes !

0:34:01.680,0:34:06.960
Now I have given my life to Christ, I want Christ to take control of my life.

0:34:07.260,0:34:14.680

0:34:24.960,0:34:27.820
God is alive.

0:34:27.820,0:34:35.180
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me the sum of N300.000 and a Holy Bible.

0:34:35.240,0:34:42.400
The Bible is very great in my life now. I will be reading it all the time.

0:34:54.620,0:34:57.520
You have decided to give your life to Jesus Christ.

0:34:57.560,0:35:01.280

0:35:06.340,0:35:12.580

0:35:20.000,0:35:27.000

0:35:43.840,0:35:46.860
Let's hear from your wife, we believe she has one or two things to contribute

0:35:46.860,0:35:49.980
to the wonderful deliverance you receive today.

0:35:50.140,0:35:52.700
Madam, we thank God almighty for your life. Tell us your name.

0:35:53.180,0:35:55.900
My name is Caroline Maku.

0:35:55.920,0:36:01.020
I really thank God for the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:36:01.020,0:36:10.280
God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver my husband from the hands of satan.

0:36:10.280,0:36:12.060
I so much thank God.

0:36:12.080,0:36:16.760
Assuming he did not come here to submit all those things (charms).

0:36:16.840,0:36:20.680
I didn't know about the whole story until now.

0:36:20.840,0:36:24.220
I know that God is here.

0:36:24.240,0:36:27.780
Before, my husband did not even know God.

0:36:28.440,0:36:33.520
I was surprised because we came here for deliverance.

0:36:33.700,0:36:39.160
Since then, the man of God has been taking care of me and my family.

0:36:39.260,0:36:42.340
He gave us money because he said that he does not want us,

0:36:42.340,0:36:45.580
to live off money from the charm any more.

0:36:45.640,0:36:51.220
I was amazed because Prophet T.B. Joshua gave my husband N300.000.

0:36:51.220,0:36:56.180
He also gave my children scholarships and gave us a Holy Bible.

0:36:56.280,0:37:00.200
He also gave us four bags of rice.

0:37:00.280,0:37:05.480
In fact, I will tell the whole world that there is Spirit of God in this church.

0:37:05.660,0:37:09.440
Thank you very much. We thank God almighty for what God has done in your life,

0:37:09.440,0:37:12.100
and for the life of your husband of bring the family together.

0:37:12.100,0:37:15.820
Also for taking the kingdom of darkness off of you.

0:37:15.820,0:37:17.260
To the glory of God.

0:37:17.460,0:37:20.900
I want to use this opportunity to inform you and your husband.

0:37:20.940,0:37:24.300
It's not enough to come to Jesus Christ for deliverance.

0:37:24.300,0:37:29.840
God almighty is in all ages, gethering into himself during speech of the worshippers

0:37:29.840,0:37:31.920
We also have a role to play !

0:37:31.940,0:37:34.620
The Bible says we should worship God in spirit and in truth.

0:37:34.620,0:37:39.360
I will also pray that the new found love in Christ Jesus,

0:37:39.360,0:37:44.060
new found life in Christ Jesus will remain permanent.

0:37:44.060,0:37:48.740
As he maintains his special relationship with our Savior Jesus Christ, in Jesus name.

0:37:48.740,0:37:49.860
