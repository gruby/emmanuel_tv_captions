0:00:00.000,0:00:06.500
I deliver you from any satanic covenant -

0:00:06.500,0:00:15.780
covenant of attitude, covenant of character - be delivered!

0:00:15.780,0:00:33.680
Be delivered!

0:00:33.680,0:00:36.180
Deliver and release yourself!

0:00:36.180,0:00:43.000
Open your lips and begin to release yourself from any satanic covenant -

0:00:43.000,0:00:56.240
covenant of attitude, covenant of character, and covenant of behaviour.

0:00:56.240,0:01:00.820
Begin to release yourself!

0:01:00.820,0:01:03.300
Get yourself out of this covenant!

0:01:03.300,0:01:05.300
You are released!

0:01:05.300,0:01:08.040
Be released!

0:01:08.040,0:01:14.260
As the fire of the Holy Spirit descended on the people following the prayer of release from Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:01:14.260,0:01:21.380
the evil spirit that had destroyed this young woman is exposed and begins to manifest.

0:01:21.380,0:01:25.360
She's a prostitute.
Spirit of anger.

0:01:25.360,0:01:30.480
The spirit that pushed her to prostitution and criss-crossed her body with tattoos

0:01:30.480,0:01:35.960
is now being consumed by the fire of God as she is about to be set free.

0:01:35.960,0:01:37.560
You are released!

0:01:37.560,0:01:42.680
Be released! In Jesus Christ's name we pray!

0:01:42.680,0:01:47.340
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:47.340,0:01:49.700
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:49.700,0:01:52.700
My name is Ayisha Idirisu.

0:01:52.700,0:01:57.280
I'm from Mali, but we are based in Ghana.

0:01:57.280,0:01:59.940
And the woman standing beside you, who is she to you?

0:01:59.940,0:02:01.780
She's my mother.

0:02:01.800,0:02:10.720
I want to thank the man of God for delivering me last Sunday from the spirit of prostitution.

0:02:10.720,0:02:13.100
I'm a professional prostitution.

0:02:13.100,0:02:15.120
You mean you're a professional prostitute.

0:02:15.120,0:02:18.160
Yes, an international prostitute.

0:02:18.160,0:02:21.800
Professional prostitute, what do you mean by that?

0:02:21.800,0:02:29.840
I put my pictures on Facebook and Instagram so that I'll be communicating with men.

0:02:29.840,0:02:36.180
I will be communicating with them to have an affair with them so that they will pay me.

0:02:36.180,0:02:39.880
It all started when I was 9 to 10 years old.

0:02:39.880,0:02:44.180
On my way to school, I met an old man.

0:02:44.180,0:02:49.280
He tricked me and gave me money to sleep with me in an unfinished building.

0:02:49.280,0:02:56.920
That is when I started having that spirit of prostitution - since that age.

0:02:56.920,0:03:04.200
I would be running after men, but not ugly men. That spirit didn''t like ugly men.

0:03:04.200,0:03:10.760
Only handsome men. If he was handsome and I liked him, no matter who he was,

0:03:10.760,0:03:17.300
if I looked at him, I had to have him.

0:03:17.300,0:03:20.580
So that is how it started.

0:03:20.580,0:03:24.860
So you mean at the age of 10 years, you started meeting men?

0:03:24.860,0:03:25.740
Yes.

0:03:25.740,0:03:27.940
And how many men did you meet every day?

0:03:27.940,0:03:31.160
Sometimes two, three or four.

0:03:31.160,0:03:35.298
Does that mean while you were doing all this, your parents - your mother and father -

0:03:35.300,0:03:37.100
they were not there to see you?

0:03:37.100,0:03:41.280
My father divorced my mom when I was very young.

0:03:41.280,0:03:46.200
So I was the one taking care of my mom, my sisters and brothers.

0:03:46.200,0:03:53.260
At that age I started being with men, going to clubs with friends,

0:03:53.260,0:03:57.420
smoking weed and cigarettes, drinking alcohol.

0:03:57.420,0:04:01.080
Sometimes I would be with my friends -

0:04:01.080,0:04:06.960
maybe we were three or four - and one man would just tell us, "I want all of you".

0:04:06.960,0:04:10.240
We would go to the man's place.

0:04:10.240,0:04:18.220
Then the man would tell us that we must be together as lesbians before he would have an affair with us.

0:04:18.220,0:04:25.320
We would be together as lesbians before he would have an affair with us.

0:04:25.320,0:04:27.820
Then he would pay us and we would go back home.

0:04:27.820,0:04:32.800
So how many of you would be together that the man would be sleeping with? How many of you?

0:04:32.800,0:04:36.540
Sometimes, we were three or four and sometimes two.

0:04:36.540,0:04:39.520
Sometimes two girls, sometimes three girls, sometimes four girls.

0:04:39.520,0:04:42.440
That was how I started doing it.

0:04:42.440,0:04:46.700
I was a prostitute when I met my baby's daddy.

0:04:46.700,0:04:48.160
At what age now?

0:04:48.160,0:04:54.600
When I met my baby's daddy, I was 15 years old.

0:04:54.600,0:04:58.720
The guy tried to change me but he couldn´t change me.

0:04:58.720,0:05:04.980
I got pregnant for him and I give birth in 2012.

0:05:04.980,0:05:09.600
My mom told the guy's family that he had to marry me.

0:05:09.600,0:05:12.880
So they came and paid my bride price.

0:05:12.880,0:05:20.800
One day, I was at my mom's place and somebody called me that the guy brought her and my friend

0:05:20.800,0:05:26.200
inside his house so I went straight to their house and fought with the girl.

0:05:26.200,0:05:32.080
The guy's mother called me and told me that her son will not marry me again

0:05:32.080,0:05:34.240
so I should just go away.

0:05:34.240,0:05:37.920
That was how I left and rented my own apartment.

0:05:37.920,0:05:44.800
I just told myself that if I didn't get married again, I should go back to my work of prostitution

0:05:44.800,0:05:49.060
because that would make me survive and take good care of my family.

0:05:49.060,0:05:52.940
So I just went back and rented an apartment.

0:05:52.940,0:05:56.880
I called guys, sometimes two guys.

0:05:56.880,0:06:02.980
I would be having an affair with two guys, three guys, four guys in the same night.

0:06:02.980,0:06:05.920
So that was how I continued to do it.

0:06:05.920,0:06:09.520
I was still forcing myself to change but no solution.

0:06:09.520,0:06:17.220
Because if I stopped, my family would not eat; my family would not do anything.

0:06:17.220,0:06:22.000
I went to a native doctor to tell the native doctor,

0:06:22.000,0:06:27.280
"This work I'm doing - I'm a prostitute -  I want to stop it but I need quick money.

0:06:27.280,0:06:31.040
I need blood money so that I can take care of my family".

0:06:31.040,0:06:36.740
The native doctor said, "Ok" and told me to bring 8000 Ghana cedis.

0:06:36.740,0:06:40.680
I went and borrowed the money.

0:06:40.680,0:06:47.520
The native doctor told me that around 10 o'clock, we would be going somewhere.

0:06:47.520,0:06:49.240
I didn't know that place.

0:06:49.240,0:06:56.320
At 10 o'clock, I went up to the native doctor's place and he took me to a cemetery.

0:06:56.320,0:07:02.600
He told me that I would bathe three times a day.

0:07:02.600,0:07:06.400
That was Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

0:07:06.400,0:07:12.540
I said, "Okay, if that will make me get the quick money, no problem. I will do it".

0:07:12.540,0:07:17.040
I followed the native doctor in doing it but no solution.

0:07:17.040,0:07:18.880
I went to pastors.

0:07:18.880,0:07:22.000
Not one pastor, not two pastors. Some of them would take my money,

0:07:22.000,0:07:25.100
some of them would be sleeping with me.

0:07:25.100,0:07:28.680
But no solution. I accepted that I had to stop this prostitution.

0:07:28.680,0:07:33.200
It was not for me. But if I stopped, my family would not eat.

0:07:33.200,0:07:35.000
So I needed quick money.

0:07:35.000,0:07:36.040
You needed quick money.

0:07:36.040,0:07:36.700
Yes.

0:07:36.700,0:07:41.160
Ok. So why did you now go to all these pastors? What were you looking for?

0:07:41.160,0:07:48.600
Ghanaian pastors will tell you that they will give you lotto numbers, plenty of things.

0:07:48.600,0:07:50.520
So you also went to them for help?

0:07:50.520,0:07:51.820
Yes, for help.

0:07:51.820,0:07:53.320
And what happened after that?

0:07:53.320,0:07:58.000
At long last, they would just sleep with me and tell me that I would get the money.

0:07:58.000,0:07:59.480
But I would not get it.

0:07:59.480,0:08:05.180
I would sleep and dream that I was swimming inside water.

0:08:05.180,0:08:13.580
When I then woke up in the morning and saw a handsome guy going

0:08:13.580,0:08:20.540
or sitting there, I would just go straight to that guy and look at him, just like that.

0:08:20.540,0:08:21.800
How did you look at them?

0:08:21.800,0:08:23.840
I would just look at him.

0:08:23.840,0:08:26.900
Just like that. I would just look at him.

0:08:26.900,0:08:31.800
So that he would fall for me and have an affair with me.

0:08:31.800,0:08:36.620
But for him to date me - no way.

0:08:36.620,0:08:39.580
He would just promise me, "I will date you; I will marry you".

0:08:39.580,0:08:41.700
So this was how you would get men?

0:08:41.700,0:08:44.380
Yes, that's how I would get men.

0:08:44.380,0:08:50.400
I didn't go for ugly men because that spirit in me didn't like ugly men.

0:08:50.400,0:08:54.380
I would only be with handsome men because when I got them and slept with them,

0:08:54.380,0:08:56.680
I would just take my money and go my way.

0:08:56.680,0:09:00.100
I didn't know what would happen to them.

0:09:00.100,0:09:04.640
Okay, you said while you were looking for quick money, you went to do some rituals.

0:09:04.640,0:09:07.420
Explain to us again: You said you were taken to a graveyard.

0:09:07.420,0:09:12.880
Yes, the native doctor took me to a graveyard and I had to get naked.

0:09:12.880,0:09:18.100
There was a certain water opposite, just behind the grave.

0:09:18.100,0:09:24.540
He told me to get naked, go inside, swim and take anything I want.

0:09:24.540,0:09:28.240
I did it three times.

0:09:28.240,0:09:33.160
He gave me an egg to put inside the water and old currency coins.

0:09:33.160,0:09:37.220
I threw them inside the water and went back but there was no solution.

0:09:37.220,0:09:39.420
I didn't go there again.

0:09:39.420,0:09:42.820
I have one friend in Nigeria - a guy.

0:09:42.820,0:09:45.740
I met him on social media - Facebook.

0:09:45.740,0:09:50.200
I told him that I needed blood money because I had to take care of my family.

0:09:50.200,0:09:52.440
He asked me, "You don't have a father?"

0:09:52.440,0:09:57.560
I said, "I have a father but he doesn't take care of us

0:09:57.560,0:10:03.000
and my mother doesn't work, so I'm the one taking care of my family".

0:10:03.000,0:10:08.060
So he said, "Okay, I will introduce you to an occultist".

0:10:08.060,0:10:10.080
He introduced me to the occultist.

0:10:10.080,0:10:13.480
He told me to bring a certain amount of money.

0:10:13.480,0:10:20.420
But I couldn't get the money and that was why I didn't go and join the cult.

0:10:20.420,0:10:25.860
After that, I just decided to travel outside the country

0:10:25.860,0:10:30.220
so that I would stop that prostitution and get money.

0:10:30.220,0:10:35.500
I called one agent and the agent told me that he could help me to travel

0:10:35.500,0:10:40.280
- to Saudi Arabia first. I said, "Okay".

0:10:40.280,0:10:45.800
I put my apartment up for rent, sold everything I had.

0:10:45.800,0:10:50.620
I even borrowed money and gave it to the agent.

0:10:50.620,0:10:58.140
That is the visa so that I could travel to Saudi Arabia. That was March last year.

0:10:58.140,0:11:03.060
He did everything and told me that I was going to work in a company.

0:11:03.060,0:11:08.920
I told him, "Okay".  When I arrived in Saudi Arabia, they took me to a certain house.

0:11:08.920,0:11:11.680
The boss inside the house told me that I should bring my passport.

0:11:11.680,0:11:16.300
I asked, "Why? I did my part. I got this passport with my money".

0:11:16.300,0:11:19.980
He told me, "I bought you. You are my slave now".

0:11:19.980,0:11:23.080
I said, "I paid a lot of money before I got here".

0:11:23.080,0:11:30.800
He said, "No, I bought you. I paid the agent 250 million Ghanaian cedis".

0:11:30.800,0:11:32.500
I then called the agent.

0:11:32.500,0:11:36.860
So you were sold for 250 million Ghanaian cedis?

0:11:36.860,0:11:37.820
Yes

0:11:37.820,0:11:39.060
To that man?

0:11:39.060,0:11:40.540
To that man.

0:11:40.540,0:11:43.680
I then called the agent but the agent didn´t pick the call.

0:11:43.680,0:11:46.400
I called my mom to tell her.

0:11:46.400,0:11:48.820
She said that I should just manage it.

0:11:48.820,0:11:51.080
So I said, "Ok, no problem".

0:11:51.080,0:11:53.600
So you were sold to this man to be doing what?

0:11:53.600,0:11:59.840
To serve him and his family for good two years as a housemaid.

0:11:59.840,0:12:03.400
before they released me to return to my country.

0:12:03.400,0:12:06.200
When I was inside the house, they were treating me very bad.

0:12:06.200,0:12:09.460
Sometimes, I would eat once in three days.

0:12:09.460,0:12:15.000
And that was not a real meal - maybe a banana or an orange and then just go to sleep.

0:12:15.000,0:12:18.840
They would be beating me up; they would do very bad things to me.

0:12:18.840,0:12:23.540
I couldn't sleep. I would sleep maybe at around 3 am in the morning,

0:12:23.540,0:12:29.440
wake up at 4 am in the morning and start working.

0:12:29.440,0:12:34.800
The house was a three-storey building and I would clean the house.

0:12:34.800,0:12:40.540
Every day, I had to clean the house with my hands.

0:12:40.540,0:12:47.240
I then made up my mind that I had to survive in this house. If not, I would just die.

0:12:47.240,0:12:49.700
My family didn´t even know where I was.

0:12:49.700,0:12:52.320
When I was working, they didn't even pay me money.

0:12:52.320,0:12:57.540
And it was because of money that I went to Saudi Arabia.

0:12:57.540,0:13:02.540
I said to myself that I had to get this man - the woman´s husband. If I did something...

0:13:02.540,0:13:03.660
You mean your boss?

0:13:03.660,0:13:05.100
Yes, my boss.

0:13:05.100,0:13:08.300
If I did something with him, I would be okay.

0:13:08.300,0:13:10.280
I would be a little bit okay in that house.

0:13:10.280,0:13:14.140
They would not treat me the way they were treating me before.

0:13:14.140,0:13:21.020
One day when the madam and the children went out, my boss said I should bring him a coffee.

0:13:21.020,0:13:25.420
After I had done the coffee and brought it into his room, I was face-to-face with the man.

0:13:25.420,0:13:30.600
When the man just looked at my eyes, he started having an affair with me.

0:13:30.600,0:13:35.200
That was how it started. That was the same way I got the man´s son too.

0:13:35.200,0:13:40.220
I was having an affair with the man and with the man´s son inside the house.

0:13:40.220,0:13:42.220
But they didn't know.

0:13:42.220,0:13:44.200
So you used the power in your eyes?

0:13:44.200,0:13:44.900
Yes.

0:13:44.900,0:13:47.900
I would just look face-to-face at them.

0:13:47.900,0:13:53.140
When I looked face-to-face at them, I would not shine my eyes or do anything.

0:13:53.140,0:13:56.980
I would just look at you and you had to have an affair with me.

0:13:56.980,0:14:01.780
The way they were treating me before reduced.

0:14:01.780,0:14:05.040
If the woman was beating me or not giving me money to eat,

0:14:05.040,0:14:09.900
the man and his son would just disgrace the woman and insult her.

0:14:09.900,0:14:15.560
But both of them didn't know that I was doing something with each of them.

0:14:15.560,0:14:18.220
That was how it was going on inside the house.

0:14:18.220,0:14:21.060
I said, "No, I didn't come here for that prostitution.

0:14:21.060,0:14:26.360
I came here to work with my hands. So why am I doing this? I must get out of the house".

0:14:26.360,0:14:29.720
I called one of my friends. She is in Dubai.

0:14:29.720,0:14:33.880
I told her about that. My friend said, "These Arab people - that is how they are.

0:14:33.880,0:14:38.360
So if you didn't do something bad to them, you could never survive in their house.

0:14:38.360,0:14:43.720
They will even kill you. So maybe you should take something and run away to the police station".

0:14:43.720,0:14:45.760
So I took one of his son's phones.

0:14:45.760,0:14:49.840
Your friend advised you that if you wanted to leave the house, you must do something wrong.

0:14:49.840,0:14:50.700
Yes.

0:14:50.700,0:14:53.780
So what did she advise you to do?

0:14:53.780,0:14:58.020
I took one of his daughter's phones and when they were sleeping,

0:14:58.020,0:15:00.860
I just jumped over the wall - it was not a small wall.

0:15:00.860,0:15:04.500
I jumped over the wall and went outside.

0:15:04.500,0:15:08.320
The police were everywhere.

0:15:08.320,0:15:11.940
When I went outside, I did not have papers. They asked and I said I didn't have them.

0:15:11.940,0:15:15.960
The police took me to the police station and asked me why I had run away.

0:15:15.960,0:15:20.860
I told them how they were treating me inside the house and they called my boss.

0:15:20.860,0:15:25.480
My boss said, "Ayisha has told me. I don't like Ayisha again".

0:15:25.480,0:15:28.800
I spent six days in the police station.

0:15:28.800,0:15:31.860
My boss came with a certain man...

0:15:31.860,0:15:36.580
Can you explain to us - why did you steal something from them?

0:15:36.580,0:15:40.760
So that my boss would say, "I don't like this girl again; I don´t want to work with this girl".

0:15:40.760,0:15:44.340
So you did that so that they would send you out of the house.

0:15:44.340,0:15:45.340
Yes.

0:15:45.340,0:15:49.600
When I was in the police station - one day, I saw my boss with a certain man.

0:15:49.600,0:15:52.240
They came and they were just talking.

0:15:52.240,0:15:58.340
He just said, "This is the girl I bought and I want to sell her to you".

0:15:58.340,0:16:02.100
I didn't say anything and my boss said, "This is your boss.

0:16:02.100,0:16:08.780
This is the money he has given me so this is your new boss who you will work for".

0:16:08.780,0:16:10.620
I said:  "Okay, no problem".

0:16:10.620,0:16:12.500
So you were sold to another man.

0:16:12.500,0:16:13.900
Another man.

0:16:13.900,0:16:17.000
I said:  "Ok, no problem" because I didn't have a choice.

0:16:17.000,0:16:21.880
If I didn't agree, I would just be in the prison, nowhere to go.

0:16:21.880,0:16:25.340
They would even kill me because they didn't know my family.

0:16:25.340,0:16:28.380
So I said, "Okay, no problem".

0:16:28.380,0:16:31.220
I followed the man to his house.

0:16:31.220,0:16:35.400
That house was even more horrible than the first house.

0:16:35.400,0:16:37.580
They were treating me very bad.

0:16:37.580,0:16:41.540
I couldn't sleep. I couldn´t do anything inside the house.

0:16:41.540,0:16:47.780
I would work for the woman and the woman would take me to her family and I would work at that house.

0:16:47.780,0:16:51.920
I would go to another house to work so that they would pay the woman.

0:16:51.920,0:16:53.880
And I would go to another house to work.

0:16:53.880,0:16:58.700
They would give the woman money.  So I was just working house to house.

0:16:58.700,0:17:02.740
So that was what I was doing at the second house.

0:17:02.740,0:17:04.460
I said to myself, "These people will kill me.

0:17:04.460,0:17:08.240
I will never go back to my country so I must do something

0:17:08.240,0:17:13.560
because it is for the sake of my family that I came here.

0:17:13.560,0:17:17.460
I came up with the same plan as in the first house.

0:17:17.460,0:17:22.340
I said to myself, "I must have this woman's husband. If I have this woman's husband,

0:17:22.340,0:17:25.960
I think my problem will be solved a little bit".

0:17:25.960,0:17:30.200
One day the woman was sleeping and her husband was inside the parlour.

0:17:30.200,0:17:35.440
I just got naked and went straight to the husband and the husband had a...

0:17:35.440,0:17:36.660
You went naked?

0:17:36.660,0:17:42.780
Yes, I went straight to the husband and he had an affair with me.

0:17:42.780,0:17:46.820
In the morning, the husband called his wife and told her

0:17:46.820,0:17:51.700
that the way they were treating me inside the house was not good. They should be careful.

0:17:51.700,0:17:55.780
Now tell us what happened?  How did you manage to return to Ghana?

0:17:55.780,0:18:01.100
I ran away and the police saw me.

0:18:01.100,0:18:07.500
They told me,"This girl has been brought to the police station every day.

0:18:07.500,0:18:11.140
We are tired with this girl. She must go to jail".

0:18:11.140,0:18:14.120
That was how they put me into jail.

0:18:14.120,0:18:16.540
I spent like three and a half months inside there.

0:18:16.540,0:18:20.000
When I was inside the jail, I saw many Africans -

0:18:20.000,0:18:25.760
Nigerians, Ugandans, Kenyans and Ghanaians.

0:18:25.760,0:18:28.600
As I'm a Muslim, I don't pray.

0:18:28.600,0:18:34.560
When I was at my first boss' place, I used to watch Emmanuel TV on YouTube.

0:18:34.560,0:18:38.700
When I went to prison, I saw that when the girls were praying,

0:18:38.700,0:18:41.800
they would mention the name of the man of God - "God of T.B. Joshua, help us!"

0:18:41.800,0:18:45.300
Then I said, "Although I am a Muslim, I must join in these prayers.

0:18:45.300,0:18:48.760
Maybe God will set me free and I can go back to my country".

0:18:48.760,0:18:51.620
I joined them; we all prayed.

0:18:51.620,0:18:55.000
We always prayed - in the morning and at night.

0:18:55.000,0:18:57.320
So one day I was just sitting there.

0:18:57.320,0:19:01.740
I didn't even know I would be free because it was not yet my time.

0:19:01.740,0:19:06.280
I had to spend maybe two years or one and a half years before they would bring me back to Ghana.

0:19:06.280,0:19:08.300
But I spent just three and a half months.

0:19:08.300,0:19:12.780
They just told me, "Ayisha, your visa is ready to go back to Ghana".

0:19:12.780,0:19:17.460
That was how I came back Ghana.

0:19:17.460,0:19:22.420
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:19:22.420,0:19:26.420
So you were joining a group of people while they were praying together,

0:19:26.420,0:19:29.220
watching Emmanuel TV, asking God to rescue them.

0:19:29.220,0:19:31.980
If God can rescue them, they will give their life to Christ.

0:19:31.980,0:19:36.420
So you joined this group of people and one day you were called that you needed to go back to your country.

0:19:36.420,0:19:43.300
Yes, they released me and people were still inside the prison but they just released me without any reason.

0:19:43.300,0:19:48.200
When I went to Ghana, I had made up my mind that I would come to The SCOAN for deliverance

0:19:48.200,0:19:50.320
because I knew that I needed deliverance.

0:19:50.320,0:19:55.500
I called one of my girlfriends because I didn´t have anywhere to stay.

0:19:55.500,0:19:57.920
I called her and my friend said I should come.

0:19:57.920,0:20:02.320
When I got to the house, I told my friend, "I need to go to The Synagogue".

0:20:02.320,0:20:05.160
My friend asked me, "To do what?" I said,  "Deliverance".

0:20:05.160,0:20:07.920
And my friend just told me, "Can deliverance give you money?

0:20:07.920,0:20:11.100
Why don't you start your prostitution again?"

0:20:11.100,0:20:15.780
I said, "Okay, it's true. Even if I get deliverance, who will feed me? Who will feed my family?"

0:20:15.780,0:20:18.280
So I should just continue my prostitution.

0:20:18.280,0:20:29.320
That was how I continued doing prostitution when I came back to Ghana.

0:20:29.320,0:20:35.300
One day, I dreamt. I saw a woman.

0:20:35.300,0:20:39.260
She was like a goddess. I saw her in my dream.

0:20:39.260,0:20:47.180
When I woke up in the morning on that fateful day, one of my girlfriends showed me something on her phone,

0:20:47.180,0:20:53.580
"I saw a tatoo on the internet yesterday night. It was very very nice". I said, "Let me see the tattoo".

0:20:53.580,0:21:04.260
When she showed me the tattoo, it was the same tattoo I had dreamt about and I went to have it done.

0:21:04.260,0:21:12.640
So you dreamt you saw this image in your dream and the following day you went to have this tattoo?

0:21:12.640,0:21:13.260
Yes.

0:21:13.260,0:21:17.580
So what was the reason for this? And what do you actually do with this tattoo?

0:21:17.580,0:21:25.600
This tattoo I have - whenever I go out, I must expose my body.

0:21:25.600,0:21:32.640
So that when people see me, they would just have feelings for me.

0:21:32.640,0:21:38.100
So you were having this and each time you went out to look for men, you had to...

0:21:38.100,0:21:44.940
Can you tell us - how did you normally dress? We can see some pictures here on the board.

0:21:44.940,0:21:49.200
And when you dressed like that, what were you actually looking for?

0:21:49.200,0:21:59.740
Okay, this dress was like - maybe when I was going out in the morning to the beachside or hotel.

0:21:59.740,0:22:04.240
That was how I dressed so that I would attract men.

0:22:04.240,0:22:09.020
This would also be in the morning because in the evening I didn´t even dress like this

0:22:09.020,0:22:10.500
- this was even long.

0:22:10.500,0:22:14.260
In the evening I didn´t dress like this at all -  that was at the beachside.

0:22:14.260,0:22:18.540
I had to dress like this so that I would be attracting men.

0:22:18.540,0:22:25.640
Maybe four or three men in a day - I would be having an affair with them.

0:22:25.640,0:22:34.920
When you came back from the journey you went to, you continued your prostitution.

0:22:34.920,0:22:36.180
Yes.

0:22:36.180,0:22:38.200
Okay. Can you continue?

0:22:38.200,0:22:46.180
Three weeks ago, I was just sitting inside my room by myself.

0:22:46.180,0:22:48.740
It was evening time.

0:22:51.120,0:22:54.560
My friends - we were four inside the room - were going out to a club. It was a Friday.

0:22:54.560,0:23:00.820
They told me, "Let´s go".  I said, "No, I don't feel like going out today. You should go".

0:23:00.820,0:23:03.460
They said, "You don't have money anymore.

0:23:03.460,0:23:06.340
Your mom is even sick and you must send money to your mom".

0:23:06.340,0:23:09.960
I said, "I don't feel like going out so you people should go".

0:23:09.960,0:23:12.040
Since I came back, I never prayed.

0:23:12.040,0:23:16.480
I had even forgotten that I had prayed and that God had set me free from the prison.

0:23:16.480,0:23:19.080
Since I had come back, I had forgotten to pray.

0:23:19.080,0:23:20.720
I was just sitting there on that fateful day.

0:23:20.720,0:23:26.700
I said, "Today I must pray because this work is not for me. I don´t want to do this work again".

0:23:26.700,0:23:32.300
So I just prayed, "God of T.B. Joshua, please save me. You are the Father of the poor.

0:23:32.300,0:23:35.380
Help me and change me in this situation".

0:23:35.380,0:23:38.980
And I slept. I saw the man of God in my dream.

0:23:38.980,0:23:42.900
He told me, "Without deliverance, you have nowhere to go".

0:23:42.900,0:23:44.800
And you have never met with the Man of God before?.

0:23:44.800,0:23:45.660
No, no, no,

0:23:45.660,0:23:46.420
You have never been here?

0:23:46.420,0:23:49.320
I have never met him before.

0:23:49.320,0:23:54.040
So I replied to  him, "Can deliverance give  me money?" because...

0:23:54.040,0:23:59.460
Yes, inside my dream and the man of God just told me straight, "With God all things are possible".

0:23:59.460,0:24:02.840
That was when I woke up from my dream.

0:24:02.840,0:24:05.840
I then said to myself, "I need to go to The  Synagogue, no matter what".

0:24:05.840,0:24:09.680
But that day - it was like I hadn't eaten for two days.

0:24:09.680,0:24:13.840
I was taking only water; I didn´t even have a penny on me.

0:24:13.840,0:24:18.880
I was using an iPhone 6 and if you sell it, it costs quite a bit.

0:24:18.880,0:24:23.180
I said to myself, "Ok, let me sell my phone and come down here".

0:24:23.180,0:24:30.080
So that was how I sold my phone and came here last week Sunday.

0:24:30.080,0:24:35.660
Now tell us: How did you receive your deliverance during the mass prayer when you came last Sunday?

0:24:35.660,0:24:38.140
Yes, I was sitting there.

0:24:38.140,0:24:46.120
When the mass prayer started, it was like hell. All over my body was fire.

0:24:46.120,0:24:51.080
Something just told me to go straight and grab the man of God's leg.

0:24:51.080,0:24:54.600
But I was just standing there.

0:24:54.600,0:25:00.160
I said, "I must go to him and grab this man´s leg because he was disturbing me with the prayer".

0:25:00.160,0:25:07.600
I just took one step, and I didn't see anything again.

0:25:07.600,0:25:12.480
MIss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:25:12.480,0:25:15.320
So during the mass prayer, while the prayer was going on,

0:25:15.320,0:25:20.460
that evil spirit inside of you was pushing you to go forward to the man of God to grab his leg.

0:25:20.460,0:25:21.140
Yes.

0:25:21.140,0:25:24.840
When you made an attempt to do that, what did you say happened to you?

0:25:24.840,0:25:26.200
I didn't see anything again.

0:25:26.200,0:25:31.460
I just saw myself that I was sitting here.

0:25:31.460,0:25:34.520
So you mean you got your deliverance last Sunday?

0:25:34.520,0:25:39.020
Yes, I got my deliverance. I didn't  even feel like smoking or taking alcohol.

0:25:39.020,0:25:44.640
So before, you used to smoke and drink.  Can you tell us what kind of cigarettes you took in the past.

0:25:44.640,0:25:50.760
I smoked weed and cigarettes, and I drank a lot of alcohol.

0:25:50.760,0:25:52.780
But since that day...

0:25:52.780,0:25:54.760
Since your deliverance.

0:25:54.760,0:26:00.540
No, I haven´t even attempted to do that or feel something for men and all that.

0:26:00.540,0:26:01.720
Since last Sunday.

0:26:01.720,0:26:02.800
Yes, since last Sunday.

0:26:02.800,0:26:06.320
You don´t feel for men. What do you mean by you don´t feel for men?

0:26:06.320,0:26:14.920
If it was like before, I would just feel something like, "Go out and get men".

0:26:14.920,0:26:19.000
But since my deliverance, that thing is not talking to me anymore.

0:26:19.000,0:26:22.900
I don´t have bad dreams anymore. I used to fly inside my dream a lot.

0:26:22.900,0:26:27.820
Every day I was inside the water swimming but since my deliverance - no more.

0:26:27.820,0:26:34.120
Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ!

0:26:34.120,0:26:40.020
The great Deliverer who has delivered our sister from the spirits of prostitution and marine spirit

0:26:40.020,0:26:42.060
that had possessed her for a very long time.

0:26:42.060,0:26:47.900
And she has explained to us how she has indeed used this power to destroy men and those around her.

0:26:47.900,0:26:50.340
Is your mom aware of this job you were doing?

0:26:50.340,0:26:53.640
Because you said that you were actually bringing money home.

0:26:53.640,0:26:58.300
No, my mom is not aware because she doesn't have a choice.

0:26:58.300,0:27:01.060
She doesn't have money, she doesn't have a helper.

0:27:01.060,0:27:05.640
So when I brought her money, she wouldn´t ask me anything.

0:27:05.640,0:27:09.640
So each time you come back home with money that you got from prostitution,

0:27:09.640,0:27:11.240
she didn´t even bother to ask you?

0:27:11.240,0:27:11.960
No.

0:27:11.960,0:27:17.100
Does this mean that you have never gone to school? You didn´t go to any college? Or study?

0:27:17.100,0:27:21.020
No, no. I just stopped school when I was in JSS 2.

0:27:21.020,0:27:24.940
You stopped schooling when you were in JSS 2. Why did you stop?

0:27:24.940,0:27:29.080
Because I didn't have money. I didn´t even have that money to go to school.

0:27:29.080,0:27:31.580
And my mom didn´t have.

0:27:31.580,0:27:37.120
So that's why I said, "I must stop and do that prostitution. It will help me".

0:27:37.120,0:27:40.000
And now to the glory of God, today you are delivered.

0:27:40.000,0:27:45.220
You are set free completely from this spirit that had been tormenting you for a very long time.

0:27:45.220,0:27:50.220
Before we listen to your mom, what word of advice do you have for young ones

0:27:50.220,0:27:54.360
who are watching you right now? Because in the first place you left Ghana

0:27:54.360,0:27:56.120
because you were looking for quick money.

0:27:56.120,0:28:00.040
And when you got to Saudi Arabia, your situation grew worse.

0:28:00.040,0:28:04.000
Can you tell us: What advice do you want to give to young ones who are watching you

0:28:04.000,0:28:06.140
and listening to you right now?

0:28:06.140,0:28:12.060
Ok, my advice is especially to young girls.

0:28:12.060,0:28:14.460
They should not rush in life.

0:28:14.460,0:28:20.100
No matter who you are, no matter how poor you are, just be patient

0:28:20.100,0:28:24.080
and wait for God's time because God's time is the best.

0:28:24.080,0:28:31.420
Those women - if their daughters bring them money and they don´t ask where they got the money from,

0:28:31.420,0:28:36.620
they should be very careful and ask their daughters where they got the money from.

0:28:36.620,0:28:44.500
Because that is how we girls do it and have money to give to our parents.

0:28:44.500,0:28:51.120
So those women should be very careful and advise their children.

0:28:51.120,0:28:54.300
Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus.

0:28:54.300,0:28:58.760
We believe that this word of advice you are giving to young ones all over the world

0:28:58.760,0:29:02.900
is a typical example that they must be content in life.

0:29:02.900,0:29:07.420
That whatever situation you find yourself in, God's time is the best.

0:29:07.420,0:29:13.300
When it's God's time for you to achieve something, your tension and pressure will never be required.

0:29:13.300,0:29:17.840
We thank God today that God Almighty has indeed brought you out of the darkness

0:29:17.840,0:29:19.720
to this marvellous light.

0:29:19.720,0:29:22.940
Now you can stand to testify to the goodness of God

0:29:22.940,0:29:27.020
that the only solution to this problem is to have Jesus Christ.

0:29:27.020,0:29:30.700
Accept Him with all your heart and when you have Him, you have everything.

0:29:30.700,0:29:31.680
We thank God for your life.

0:29:31.680,0:29:37.080
Let's quickly listen to your mother, who we believe has one or two things to say.

0:29:37.080,0:29:51.540
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:29:51.540,0:29:55.480
Origninally I'm from Niger but I live in Ghana.

0:29:55.480,0:29:59.480
Okay, Mamma. Can you tell us: what do you know about your daughter?

0:29:59.480,0:30:03.980
I believe you've listened to one or two things that she has just said.

0:30:03.980,0:30:21.820
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:30:21.820,0:30:26.000
My daughter at the age between 9 and 10,  became very stubborn.

0:30:26.000,0:30:30.320
Anything I told her, she didn't listen to it.

0:30:30.320,0:30:57.760
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:30:57.760,0:31:02.300
When she was between 9 and 10, I divorced the father.

0:31:02.300,0:31:05.540
She was supposed to be in JSS 2 but she stopped schooling.

0:31:05.540,0:31:08.880
So the mother then asked the daughter, "Why have you stopped schooling?"

0:31:08.880,0:31:13.600
The daughter said, "Because you don't have money to sponsor me in my education anymore,

0:31:13.600,0:31:16.400
I want to go and live my life somewhere else".

0:31:16.400,0:31:20.360
Were you aware that your daughter was doing prostitution?

0:31:20.360,0:31:29.760
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:31:29.760,0:31:35.360
In the beginning, I didn't know what job she was doing. It was later that I found out.

0:31:35.360,0:31:39.400
Since she received her deliverance, what changes have you seen in her?

0:31:39.400,0:32:18.040
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:32:18.040,0:32:22.400
Since her deliverance last Sunday, everything about the daughter has changed.

0:32:22.400,0:32:24.980
She doesn't go anywhere; she stays in the house.

0:32:24.980,0:32:29.100
She used to chat - she doesn´t chat anymore.

0:32:29.100,0:32:32.100
Even when there's no food in the house,  she doesn't go out.

0:32:32.100,0:32:36.080
She is always inside. She doesn't have any urge to go out.

0:32:36.080,0:32:39.800
What advice do you have for parents who are listening to you,

0:32:39.800,0:32:42.340
looking at where you are actually coming from?

0:32:42.340,0:32:45.640
What advice do you want to give to parents listening to you right now?

0:32:45.640,0:33:26.420
Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:33:26.420,0:33:30.760
The first one I want to say is that divorcing is very bad.

0:33:30.760,0:33:38.380
The second one I have to say is that because of the business the daughter was doing

0:33:38.380,0:33:41.960
and bringing money home, she was not able to control her.

0:33:41.960,0:33:44.940
So parents, we should be able to control our children,

0:33:44.940,0:33:48.460
wherever they bring us something from outside.

0:33:48.460,0:33:52.900
We thank God for your life, Madam, and we know that God Almighty has delivered your daughter.

0:33:52.900,0:33:57.220
We just want to advise you, our sister, that now God Almighty has set you free

0:33:57.220,0:34:01.540
from all these evil spirits that caused you to be prostituting,

0:34:01.540,0:34:04.800
we pray that God Almighty in His infinite mercy will grant you the grace

0:34:04.800,0:34:07.680
to live the rest of your life for Him.

0:34:07.680,0:34:10.100
Make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:34:10.100,0:34:13.420
Be close to Christ Jesus and receive instruction from Him.

0:34:13.420,0:34:17.200
We pray that God will grant you the grace to do so, in Jesus' name.

0:34:17.200,0:34:18.480
Amen!

0:34:18.480,0:34:22.340
Testimony Continues

0:34:22.340,0:34:25.320
My name is Ayisha Idirisu. I´m from Ghana.

0:34:25.320,0:34:27.420
The lady beside me is my mom.

0:34:27.420,0:34:29.840
We are originally from Niger.

0:34:29.840,0:34:38.420
I was the lady who was delivered from the spirit of prostitution and now I'm free, in Jesus' name.

0:34:38.420,0:34:42.780
I have seen a lot of change - no more bad dreams.

0:34:42.780,0:34:47.960
I used to dream that I was flying, swimming in water,

0:34:47.960,0:34:50.100
eating in the dream and even having affairs in the dream.

0:34:50.100,0:34:52.580
Since I have been delivered, I am okay.

0:34:52.580,0:34:57.120
I no longer dream about those types of things.

0:34:57.120,0:35:01.000
I used to feel like having relationships with guys.

0:35:01.000,0:35:08.580
If I looked into a guy's eyes, he would just fall for me but now, I have tried it and it is no more.

0:35:08.580,0:35:10.960
So that spirit of lust has completely gone?

0:35:10.960,0:35:12.380
It has completely gone.

0:35:12.380,0:35:15.940
I used to smoke a lot; I used to smoke weed and cigarettes.

0:35:15.940,0:35:19.480
I don´t smoke, I don´t take alcohol anymore.

0:35:19.480,0:35:23.120
I don't even have the urge to do that again.

0:35:23.120,0:35:26.300
And during your testimony you said before, you would go on the internet,

0:35:26.300,0:35:29.020
use Facebook, post your pictures to attract men.

0:35:29.020,0:35:31.160
And now that you're delivered, what can you say about all of that?

0:35:31.160,0:35:34.020
I have stopped. I just planned that when I return to Ghana,

0:35:34.020,0:35:37.700
I will block all of my Facebook contacts and internet.

0:35:37.700,0:35:40.920
I'll block everything so that I will begin a new life.

0:35:40.920,0:35:45.060
Before you came to The SCOAN, just tell us the kind of area that you are living in before.

0:35:45.060,0:35:48.880
I was living with my friends in a ghetto house.

0:35:48.880,0:35:55.960
That was where I lived with my friends and did prostitution.

0:35:55.960,0:36:01.240
That place you are coming from is actually from an area where you are constantly with people

0:36:01.240,0:36:02.620
that are involved in that prostitution.

0:36:02.620,0:36:06.560
As you are going back to Ghana now, do you mean you are going to change that environment?

0:36:06.560,0:36:10.680
Yes, sure. I´m going to change that environment.

0:36:10.680,0:36:12.640
We thank God once again for our sister's life.

0:36:12.640,0:36:15.220
We know that the evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.

0:36:15.220,0:36:18.240
We just want to hear one word from your mother.

0:36:18.240,0:36:22.640
Mrs Hajara Ahmedu
Nigerian Living In Ghana

0:36:22.640,0:36:27.920
Her name is Mrs. Hajara Ahmedu and she´s from Ghana but originally from Niger.

0:36:27.920,0:36:39.440
I want to thank God for everything because now, my daughter has changed; I am happy.

0:36:39.440,0:36:44.600
My mom said she wants to thank God for everything because now, I have changed.

0:36:44.600,0:36:50.540
I have really changed and she is very happy. She wants to thank God for that.

0:36:50.540,0:36:54.680
We've heard all from our mother.  We thank God for the deliverance in the life of our sister.

0:36:54.680,0:36:58.000
Sister, we are here right now with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:36:58.000,0:37:03.820
The Man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he really wants to support you in every area of your life

0:37:03.820,0:37:06.820
as you're going back to Ghana now to start a new life.

0:37:06.820,0:37:10.340
On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners worldwide,

0:37:10.340,0:37:15.980
we are here to present to you this cash gift of 2000 US Dollars

0:37:15.980,0:37:19.240
and also the Word of God, "The Mirror" which is just an encouragement

0:37:19.240,0:37:22.240
for you to stay close to Jesus and make His word the standard for your life.

0:37:22.240,0:37:24.840
I can't even talk. I'm really shocked.

0:37:24.840,0:37:28.340
Seriously, because I didn't even expect this at all.

0:37:28.340,0:37:33.700
I never expected that at all. I'm really shocked.

0:37:33.700,0:37:38.760
I'm going to use this money to start a new life; to start a new business.

0:37:38.760,0:37:44.520
I thank God, Emmanuel TV, the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:37:44.520,0:37:47.820
Thank You, Jesus, I'm free.

0:37:47.820,0:37:49.200
I am free; thank You, Lord!

0:37:49.200,0:37:50.460
Wow, thank You, Jesus.

0:37:50.460,0:37:52.600
Right now, we believe many people are watching you.

0:37:52.600,0:37:55.060
Even girls that are involved in prostitution.

0:37:55.060,0:37:58.760
Your people that knew you very well in the past may be watching you right now.

0:37:58.760,0:38:02.620
What is your advice to people that are involved in such a lifestyle?

0:38:02.620,0:38:09.900
My advice especially for ladies like me: They should change.

0:38:09.900,0:38:15.060
No matter who you are, just change and get close to God.

0:38:15.060,0:38:18.540
With God all things are possible.

0:38:18.540,0:38:20.720
Thank You, Jesus Christ. We thank God for your life, sister.

0:38:20.720,0:38:23.560
We pray that God will give you the grace to continue to stay close to Jesus

0:38:23.560,0:38:25.700
and make use of this wonderful gift.

0:38:25.700,0:38:29.580
We believe that you're going to come back with more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.

0:38:29.580,0:38:32.560
Amen. Thank You, Jesus, I am free!

0:38:32.560,0:38:35.380
I'm very happy. Thank You, Jesus!
