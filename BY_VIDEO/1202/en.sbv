There is a woman there! You keep seeing dead people in your dream all the time.

0:00:07.840,0:00:09.300
Please, come out.

0:00:09.300,0:00:12.400
Man of God, help me. I am the woman who always sees dead people in the dream.

0:00:12.400,0:00:14.280
I always see dead people, and that is why I came here.

0:00:14.280,0:00:15.800
You don't want to die?

0:00:15.800,0:00:19.480
I don't want to die now, my children are still small. I'm a widow.

0:00:19.480,0:00:22.160
Forget about that.

0:00:22.160,0:00:23.400
I don't want to die.

0:00:23.400,0:00:26.300
If you are ready to live for God, you will not die.

0:00:26.300,0:00:28.100
I am living for God, Man of God.

0:00:28.100,0:00:30.560
You have been living for God? Ok, it's alright.

0:00:30.560,0:00:35.000
If you have been living for God, you would not be afraid of death. Over there is our home.

0:00:35.000,0:00:38.940
Who will take care of my children that are here, if I go there?

0:00:38.940,0:00:40.140
Where?

0:00:40.140,0:00:42.400
The place you are talking about now.

0:00:42.400,0:00:46.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:46.200,0:00:49.900
The place I am talking about now?

0:00:49.900,0:00:51.860
You don't know the place?

0:00:51.860,0:00:53.220
I know. If I'm saying...

0:00:53.220,0:00:58.100
No, no. The place I'm talking about - as if I'm the only person that knows the place.

0:00:58.100,0:01:01.320
Does it mean you don't know the place?

0:01:01.320,0:01:02.680
I know the place, Man of God.

0:01:02.680,0:01:04.040
Where is the place?

0:01:04.040,0:01:07.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:07.860,0:01:10.180
Where is the place, if you know the placet?

0:01:10.180,0:01:15.400
It's too early for me to go there now.

0:01:15.400,0:01:19.000
- It's too early for you to go there?
- Now.

0:01:19.000,0:01:24.840
Are you saying it was too early for Jesus to go there at 33?

0:01:24.840,0:01:26.520
How old are you now?

0:01:26.520,0:01:28.900
No, His own was a...

0:01:28.900,0:01:34.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:34.100,0:01:36.460
His own was a divine something.

0:01:36.460,0:01:38.440
- Your own is what?
- His was predicted.

0:01:38.440,0:01:43.160
His own was divine something and it was for a purpose.

0:01:43.160,0:01:45.520
What of your own?

0:01:45.520,0:01:47.540
I don't know now.

0:01:47.540,0:01:51.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:51.860,0:01:54.840
I said that I'm a widow and my children are very small.

0:01:54.840,0:01:57.360
It's like you know death is coming.

0:01:57.360,0:01:58.980
That is the question. Answer me.

0:01:58.980,0:02:00.840
It's because I am seeing dead people.

0:02:00.840,0:02:07.800
It's not good for someone living here to be associating with dead people while sleeping.

0:02:07.800,0:02:09.580
So, you have denied your husband?

0:02:09.580,0:02:11.940
That's not what the Bible says.

0:02:11.940,0:02:17.780
The Bible says that after death, there is no husband and wife again.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:23.780,0:02:28.920
I know you have some splendour, wealth you don't just want to leave behind.

0:02:28.920,0:02:30.800
It's just because of my children.

0:02:30.800,0:02:32.780
If they were grown up, I won't bother.

0:02:32.780,0:02:34.440
We will ask God.

0:02:34.440,0:02:39.300
If you are going to live for Him, this death, we will remove it.

0:02:39.300,0:02:40.940
But if you are not ready to live for Him...

0:02:40.940,0:02:45.400
I am ready to live for Him all the days of my life, Man of God.
