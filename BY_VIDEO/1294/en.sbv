The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:00.800,0:01:07.260
Tell your neighbor:  "It is a new dawn."

0:01:07.260,0:01:10.840
It is a new dawn.

0:01:10.840,0:01:17.280
The Bible says that if anything is in Christ.

0:01:17.280,0:01:21.600
is a new creation in

0:01:21.600,0:01:24.120
In the mind of God..

0:01:24.120,0:01:28.960
old man has stopped being....

0:01:28.960,0:01:30.960
The new man...

0:01:30.960,0:01:33.260
has taken his place.

0:01:33.260,0:01:36.340
My name is Gingka.

0:01:36.340,0:01:43.160
And today by the grace of God, I want to tell you that whatever unpleasant situation that you may be facing..

0:01:43.160,0:01:47.380
whatever seems impossible in your life

0:01:47.380,0:01:48.920
Get ready

0:01:48.920,0:01:54.520
Because the Holy Spirit will make it possible in Jesus name.

0:01:54.520,0:01:59.780
In the book of Genesis chapter 1 verse 3

0:01:59.780,0:02:03.600
When God said.   "et there be light."

0:02:03.600,0:02:07.780
The Bible says he trusted His Word..

0:02:07.780,0:02:11.840
and there was light.

0:02:11.840,0:02:17.400
He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

0:02:17.400,0:02:22.420
He was not speaking out of things that were already in existence.

0:02:22.420,0:02:24.980
But of things that are yet unseen.

0:02:24.980,0:02:29.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:29.040,0:02:34.660
Things that look naturally impossible.

0:02:34.660,0:02:36.660
His expression showed..

0:02:36.660,0:02:39.520
that whatever God ordered or

0:02:39.520,0:02:42.140
or decreed out of faith..

0:02:42.140,0:02:44.620
came into being.

0:02:44.620,0:02:48.360
I don't know the challenges that you are facing this morning brethren.

0:02:48.360,0:02:53.580
And I don't know the mountain that just surrounds you.

0:02:53.580,0:03:00.180
But I tell you if you can exercise that absolute faith that God had in His Word..

0:03:00.180,0:03:02.620
When creating you..

0:03:02.620,0:03:05.000
You can set your Mountain

0:03:05.000,0:03:08.380
move with faith in your heart

0:03:08.380,0:03:13.560
Without doubt, you will move the impossible.

0:03:13.560,0:03:16.100
Talking about trust.

0:03:16.100,0:03:20.100
Trust, moves the impossible.

0:03:20.100,0:03:21.300
Trust..

0:03:21.300,0:03:23.820
Moves the impossible.

0:03:23.820,0:03:28.780
The Bible says that everyone is endowed with something within.

0:03:28.780,0:03:33.820
That needs to be transferred to the outside.

0:03:33.820,0:03:38.780
You have been endowed with something within.

0:03:38.780,0:03:42.900
That needs to be transferred to the outside.

0:03:42.900,0:03:49.600
It is easy to say:  "I have faith man.  And continue to hope for years.

0:03:49.600,0:03:56.200
As long as you continue hoping, the Bible says it will always be beyond you

0:03:56.200,0:04:04.260
until you add substance to your hope and receive Christ by faith.

0:04:04.260,0:04:10.720
The Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for.

0:04:10.720,0:04:15.920
Faith is the substance of things we hope for.

0:04:15.920,0:04:23.260
Faith and hope, the Bible says, go together.

0:04:23.260,0:04:30.280
The problem of our faith brethren is not far from the fact that we fail to add substance to our hope..

0:04:30.280,0:04:33.020
and receive Christ by faith.

0:04:33.020,0:04:36.420
And that is why the book of James says that faith

0:04:36.420,0:04:40.100
Is to be expressed through works..

0:04:40.100,0:04:45.560
Faith without works, the Bible says, is dead.

0:04:45.560,0:04:54.440
But don't forget that, it is your work that confirmed that, faith is alive and active in you.

0:04:54.440,0:05:04.320
It sees your actions that confirm the faith is alive and active in you.

0:05:04.320,0:05:12.640
It is your deeds that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.

0:05:12.640,0:05:19.280
Therefore faith is perfected by our acting on the Word of God.

0:05:19.280,0:05:24.080
You see faith can be likened to the soup you prepare in your various forms.

0:05:24.080,0:05:27.260
I know we have a lot of shelves in the house.

0:05:27.260,0:05:31.680
We have a lot of people who know how to make soup.

0:05:31.680,0:05:35.880
Those ingredients you put together to make soup.

0:05:35.880,0:05:41.960
Are all the Bible refers to as substance.

0:05:41.960,0:05:45.380
I really want to ask one or two people here..

0:05:45.380,0:05:48.520
if you can just tell us..

0:05:48.520,0:05:51.060
if you would like to make..

0:05:51.060,0:05:53.180
local dish.. I mean soup..

0:05:53.180,0:05:56.900
Can you tell us what are the two three ingredients you put together to make a soup.

0:05:56.900,0:05:59.060
I believe you are going to represent..

0:05:59.060,0:06:06.900
all the good cooks, good chefs here. Tell us one or two three ingredients you put together.

0:06:06.900,0:06:13.900
Well, I like tomato soup so I will take onions and also..

0:06:13.900,0:06:17.700
chicken what I like... and...

0:06:17.700,0:06:18.900
Maggie

0:06:18.900,0:06:20.480
That is good.

0:06:20.480,0:06:25.532
You see our sister just told us about four different ingredients that she, on her own,

0:06:25.540,0:06:27.840
will put together to make

0:06:27.840,0:06:31.760
beautiful soup.

0:06:31.760,0:06:36.960
You know you can make your soup in different ways and still have your wonderful results.

0:06:36.960,0:06:38.710
Now in faith..

0:06:38.710,0:06:42.940
Those ingredients you put together..

0:06:42.940,0:06:48.940
I mean those substances that you put together to make a right result..

0:06:48.940,0:06:52.100
in faith the Bible refers to them as trust..

0:06:52.100,0:06:58.120
Does Maggie.. chicken you are talking about.. the Bible refer to them as..

0:06:58.120,0:06:59.800
confidence..

0:06:59.800,0:07:01.600
obedience..

0:07:01.600,0:07:07.480
patience.. perseverance.. endurance-

0:07:07.480,0:07:11.720
These are the instrument of faith.

0:07:11.720,0:07:19.260
The Bible refers to them as works.

0:07:19.260,0:07:23.360
Today we want to move impossibilities in our lives.

0:07:23.360,0:07:27.040
But we fail to consider those ingredients;

0:07:27.040,0:07:33.740
tose substances that we need to activate our faith.

0:07:33.740,0:07:36.920
Our hearts desire breakthrough.

0:07:36.920,0:07:42.060
But we don't seem to understand that we need to add those substances.. those ingredients.

0:07:42.060,0:07:46.640
to activate our faith.

0:07:46.640,0:07:54.120
In the book of Genesis 15, the Bible says that Abraham understood this principle.

0:07:54.120,0:08:02.660
When God promised that He is going to father many nations.. at his old age.

0:08:02.660,0:08:08.540
The Bible says he trusted God;  that God would keep His Word.

0:08:08.540,0:08:17.380
What God valued in Abraham was the trust he had in his ability to do the impossible.

0:08:17.380,0:08:19.700
Abraham trusted God...

0:08:19.700,0:08:25.920
that God would do the impossible and that was what God valued so much in him.

0:08:25.920,0:08:28.120
Tell your neighbor:  "Trust..

0:08:28.120,0:08:29.720
Trust..

0:08:29.720,0:08:32.000
more the impossible.

0:08:32.000,0:08:35.560
And that would be the title of our message today.

0:08:35.560,0:08:42.220
And I would like to go to the Book of James chapter 2 as our true text.

0:08:42.220,0:08:48.560
The book of James chapter 2.  And let's take our reading from verse 14.

0:08:48.560,0:08:50.800
Now I read.

0:08:50.800,0:08:54.720
What are the profit, my brethren..

0:08:54.720,0:09:00.040
If someone says he has faith, but does not have works?

0:09:00.040,0:09:04.500
Can faith save him?

0:09:04.500,0:09:11.460
If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food...

0:09:11.460,0:09:14.440
And one of you said to them:  "Depart in peace."

0:09:14.440,0:09:22.140
"Be warmed and filled." But you do not give them the things which are needed for the body?

0:09:22.140,0:09:25.420
What does it profit?

0:09:25.420,0:09:33.000
Does also faith, by itself, if it does not have works is dead.

0:09:33.000,0:09:34.824
But someone would say:

0:09:34.824,0:09:37.000
"You have faith..

0:09:37.000,0:09:39.600
and I have works.

0:09:39.600,0:09:46.340
Show me your faith without your works and how I show you my faith by my works?

0:09:46.340,0:09:48.740
You believe that there is one God.

0:09:48.740,0:09:51.140
You do well.

0:09:51.140,0:09:53.160
Even the demons believe..

0:09:53.160,0:09:56.320
and... tremble.

0:09:56.320,0:10:03.860
But if you want to know, oh foolish man, that faith without works is dead.

0:10:03.860,0:10:11.420
Was not Abraham, our Father, justified by works when he offered Isaac, his son, on the altar?

0:10:11.420,0:10:18.960
Do you see that faith was working together with his works? And by his works, faith was made perfect.

0:10:18.960,0:10:21.380
Verse 23..

0:10:21.380,0:10:25.440
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says

0:10:25.440,0:10:31.200
Abraham believed God.  And it was accounted to him for righteousness.

0:10:31.200,0:10:35.780
And he was called "the friend.. of God."

0:10:35.780,0:10:37.500
The last verse for this..

0:10:37.500,0:10:38.960
protests?

0:10:38.960,0:10:40.440
Verse 24...

0:10:40.440,0:10:48.680
You see then that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.

0:10:48.680,0:10:53.620
Tell your neighbor:   "A man is justified by works.."

0:10:53.620,0:10:57.360
I will be justified by my works..

0:10:57.360,0:11:00.820
and not by faith alone.

0:11:00.820,0:11:03.780
You see...trusting in God...

0:11:03.780,0:11:06.880
does not consist in prayer alone.

0:11:06.880,0:11:10.820
There are times that we pray in faith.

0:11:10.820,0:11:15.360
And there are times that we aren't in faith.

0:11:15.360,0:11:19.040
I mean there are things that we must do ourselves.

0:11:19.040,0:11:23.200
And others we expect from God.

0:11:23.200,0:11:27.260
There are things that we must do ourselves.

0:11:27.260,0:11:33.020
And there are some things that we will expect from God.

0:11:33.020,0:11:37.620
We all have sent our petitions to God.

0:11:37.620,0:11:40.940
We all have sent our requests..

0:11:40.940,0:11:43.640
our hearts desire to God.

0:11:43.640,0:11:49.180
It is high time for you to sit back in faith to hear what God has to say..

0:11:49.180,0:11:55.020
about your situation.

0:11:55.020,0:11:57.560
In those processes..brethren..

0:11:57.560,0:12:00.340
you need to add trust.

0:12:00.340,0:12:01.920
You need to add..

0:12:01.940,0:12:04.080
patience..

0:12:04.080,0:12:05.560
You need to add..

0:12:05.560,0:12:07.900
perseverance.. obedience..

0:12:07.900,0:12:12.120
a substance to your hope.. and activate your faith.

0:12:12.120,0:12:15.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:15.360,0:12:20.980
Prophet TB Joshua says:  "prayer for any special objects.."

0:12:20.980,0:12:25.960
must be followed by an absolute trust in the Father...

0:12:25.960,0:12:31.840
that he is walking out the answer."

0:12:31.840,0:12:35.020
Prayer for any special objects..

0:12:35.020,0:12:38.880
Because faith is not a legalistic formula..

0:12:38.880,0:12:43.840
created and accepted by man.

0:12:43.840,0:12:45.200
Faith..

0:12:45.200,0:12:48.480
is not a legalistic formula

0:12:48.480,0:12:52.480
created and accepted by man

0:12:52.480,0:12:56.240
God's response to faith and not formula.

0:12:56.240,0:13:03.400
Faith is not an issue of ordering God around as many do today.

0:13:03.400,0:13:05.340
How do I mean?

0:13:05.340,0:13:14.820
We are ordering God around when we do not know God's will for our lives and we continue to pray.

0:13:14.820,0:13:22.900
Remember God's will means God's promises for our lives. That is why you see people murmuring

0:13:22.900,0:13:25.160
complaining

0:13:25.160,0:13:28.940
When the answer to their prayers seems to delay in coming.

0:13:28.940,0:13:31.400
They begin to seek for shortcuts...

0:13:31.420,0:13:36.200
alternatives... bits in the gun..

0:13:36.200,0:13:37.620
Brethren..

0:13:37.620,0:13:42.580
You must always understand that when God is executing His plans..

0:13:42.580,0:13:44.720
in your life..

0:13:44.720,0:13:48.580
He also designs and arranges events..

0:13:48.580,0:13:51.940
which will continue to unfold..

0:13:51.940,0:13:57.000
until his purpose is revealed in your life.

0:13:57.000,0:13:58.928
Now take note of this:

0:13:58.928,0:14:01.060
God promises.

0:14:01.060,0:14:05.360
I know God must have promised us a lot of things

0:14:05.360,0:14:08.420
God promises..

0:14:08.420,0:14:11.000
He, Himself..

0:14:11.000,0:14:12.300
also

0:14:12.300,0:14:14.260
designs..

0:14:14.260,0:14:16.140
he creates..

0:14:16.140,0:14:17.680
He plans..

0:14:17.680,0:14:19.100
before..

0:14:19.100,0:14:22.480
fulfilling those promises in your life.

0:14:22.480,0:14:25.740
He designs events..

0:14:25.740,0:14:28.120
of your life as Christians.

0:14:28.120,0:14:32.500
Those events could be the unpleasant situation that you are going through.

0:14:32.500,0:14:35.500
I mean.. those plans.. could be..

0:14:35.500,0:14:37.020
the challenges.

0:14:37.020,0:14:38.100
Persecution..

0:14:38.100,0:14:42.040
that you may be going through right now.

0:14:42.040,0:14:48.080
Brethren..if God allowed it as they did to Job and the host of others

0:14:48.080,0:14:54.960
Do not think it strange and doubt your God.

0:14:54.960,0:14:56.940
If God allowed it..

0:14:56.940,0:15:02.480
you must not consider it unusual or abnormal.

0:15:02.480,0:15:07.640
If God allowed that unpleasant situation you must not consider it odd..

0:15:07.640,0:15:12.080
and begin to question your faith.

0:15:12.080,0:15:16.220
Because when some does not see beyond the immediate situation..

0:15:16.220,0:15:17.600
you know as man..

0:15:17.600,0:15:21.380
they want to plan themselves.

0:15:21.380,0:15:22.880
Because they can't wait for God's time.

0:15:22.880,0:15:29.080
They wants to design themselves.. if possible.. execute their own plan themselves.

0:15:29.080,0:15:31.540
Whereas they are the work..

0:15:31.540,0:15:33.560
of art.

0:15:33.560,0:15:35.620
The Book of Genesis..

0:15:35.620,0:15:39.660
Chapter 22,  the Bible says that Abraham

0:15:39.660,0:15:45.080
Moved and did the impossible.

0:15:45.080,0:15:50.800
When God instructed him to sacrifice his only child..

0:15:50.800,0:15:55.480
Abram knew that Isaac was a child of promise.

0:15:55.480,0:16:00.440
Abram realized that God will not delight Himself..

0:16:00.440,0:16:03.220
in breaking the covenant ..

0:16:03.220,0:16:07.440
by killing the object of His promise.

0:16:07.440,0:16:15.180
And that is why when Isaac asked his father in that verse 7..

0:16:15.180,0:16:17.140
He said:  "Father..

0:16:17.140,0:16:20.100
You said we are going for sacrifice.."

0:16:20.100,0:16:21.560
"But..

0:16:21.560,0:16:24.100
this is food..

0:16:24.100,0:16:31.440
And this is fire.. but father,  tell me, where is the lamb for the offering?"

0:16:31.440,0:16:33.800
Abram said to Isaac.

0:16:33.800,0:16:36.840
He said:  "My son..

0:16:36.840,0:16:40.920
The Lord would provide for Hmself..

0:16:40.920,0:16:42.199
the lamb

0:16:42.200,0:16:44.520
for the offering.

0:16:44.520,0:16:50.340
The Bible says immediately the Holy Spirit affected His word.

0:16:50.340,0:16:54.080
And His word became an instrument of victory.

0:16:57.840,0:16:59.960
Obeying God at first..

0:16:59.960,0:17:02.800
seems hard..

0:17:02.800,0:17:09.020
until we come to realize that all He asks is for our good

0:17:09.020,0:17:14.060
He makes life full and free for us.

0:17:14.060,0:17:18.560
Tell your neighbor:  "It  honors God to believe Him."

0:17:18.560,0:17:22.060
It' honors God to believe Him.

0:17:22.060,0:17:26.800
Even while every sense contradicts him

0:17:26.800,0:17:33.020
Even while every sense contradicts Him.

0:17:33.020,0:17:38.100
For example, we have seen someone who had been promised..

0:17:38.100,0:17:42.680
of being a bank manager..

0:17:42.680,0:17:47.360
and finally he receives a sack letter as a clerk

0:17:47.360,0:17:55.700
Little did he know that that sack letter was to reveal the purpose of God for his life

0:17:55.700,0:17:58.760
We have seen many gardeners..

0:17:58.760,0:18:01.060
who finally became..

0:18:01.060,0:18:05.280
managing directors of companies.

0:18:05.280,0:18:13.420
We have seen.. a prisoner..who finally became a president of a nation.

0:18:13.420,0:18:16.520
We have indeed seen as servant..

0:18:16.520,0:18:18.920
who yesterday..

0:18:18.920,0:18:21.920
Who finally became a leader today.

0:18:21.920,0:18:24.800
Tell your neighbor: "It honors God..

0:18:24.800,0:18:27.140
it honors God..

0:18:27.140,0:18:29.480
So believe Him..

0:18:29.480,0:18:32.440
everyone.. every sense..

0:18:32.440,0:18:34.920
contradicts Him.

0:18:34.920,0:18:36.200
What is your situation?

0:18:36.200,0:18:41.820
Remember, crossing the Red Sea was an impossible task, in the natural.

0:18:41.820,0:18:44.740
The Bible says the Red Sea was against..

0:18:44.740,0:18:50.220
the free movement of the Israelites into the Promised Land.

0:18:50.220,0:18:54.900
The Red Sea was against their success.

0:18:54.900,0:18:58.840
The Red Sea was against their free movement.

0:18:58.840,0:19:01.400
But Moses looked beyond it.

0:19:01.400,0:19:05.360
And moved the impossible.

0:19:05.360,0:19:09.920
I wanted to begin to say right now with faith in your hearts

0:19:09.920,0:19:15.620
That whatever Red Sea stands against me and my success..

0:19:15.620,0:19:21.140
Say it with all your heart.. because the only spirit will affect your word right now

0:19:21.140,0:19:24.560
and that word will become an instrument..

0:19:24.560,0:19:30.060
Say:   "Whatever Red Sea stands against me and my success..

0:19:30.060,0:19:34.880
Whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my freedom..

0:19:34.880,0:19:39.260
Whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my success..

0:19:39.260,0:19:42.380
In the name of Jesus Christ give way!

0:19:42.380,0:19:45.980
In the name of Jesus Christ, begin to give way!

0:19:45.980,0:19:48.200
Say it with all your heart!

0:19:48.200,0:19:51.320
Because only  the spiritual will affect you right now..

0:19:51.320,0:19:52.940
and that word..

0:19:52.940,0:19:57.180
will  bring about your victory today in the name of Jesus Christ!

In Jesus' mighty Name!

0:20:05.140,0:20:08.960
For those who want to see before they believe..

0:20:08.960,0:20:13.200
I want to tell you.. remember what the Bible says in the Book of John 20 verse 29..

0:20:13.200,0:20:19.320
that "Blessed are those who have not yet seen but believe."

0:20:19.320,0:20:26.200
For faith based on what is seen, lacks  the quality of being stable

0:20:26.200,0:20:33.040
2 Corinthians 5 verse 7 says:  "We walk by faith and not by sight."

0:20:33.040,0:20:40.880
It is faith that sees the invisible.. what the ordinary eyes cannot see

0:20:40.880,0:20:42.840
It is faith..

0:20:42.840,0:20:45.600
that move the impossible..

0:20:45.600,0:20:50.980
It is faith that receives the incredible.

0:20:50.980,0:20:53.280
Tell your neighbor:  "Trust..

0:20:53.280,0:20:57.120
"Trust and move the impossible."

0:20:57.120,0:20:58.640
Trust..

0:20:58.640,0:21:00.980
moves the impossible..

0:21:00.980,0:21:03.960
in Jesus name!

0:21:03.960,0:21:12.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:12.260,0:21:18.680
Remember the Jewish brothers in the Book of Daniel 3

0:21:18.680,0:21:22.740
The Bible says:  "A believing heart...

0:21:22.740,0:21:26.820
produces right behavior.

0:21:26.820,0:21:34.500
Good words as a proof of faith.

0:21:34.500,0:21:36.380
A believing heart..

0:21:36.380,0:21:45.200
produces right behavior.. good words.. as the proof of faith

0:21:45.200,0:21:49.180
Right words..

0:21:49.180,0:21:51.180
Right behavior..

0:21:51.180,0:21:53.520
that honor Jesus.

0:21:53.520,0:21:58.080
reveals that faith is already launched in the hearts..

0:21:58.080,0:22:01.600
In Daniel 3 from verse 17 to 18..

0:22:01.600,0:22:09.940
When Nebuchadnezzar threatened  Shadrach Meshach and Abednego with fire

0:22:09.940,0:22:15.800
The Bible says: "They trusted the god of the impossibilities."

0:22:15.800,0:22:19.080
and that is why they were bored to say to the king

0:22:19.080,0:22:22.180
Oh King,  we want you to know

0:22:22.180,0:22:27.280
that If we are thrown inside this very furnace..

0:22:27.280,0:22:30.100
Our God is able

0:22:30.100,0:22:38.940
more than able, to rescue us, to deliver us and to set us free,.

0:22:38.940,0:22:40.920
But, If he does not..

0:22:40.920,0:22:50.400
we want you to know, oh majesty, that we will not serve your gods or your image that you have set up

0:22:50.400,0:22:56.000
The Bible says: "The Holy Spirit affected their word."

0:22:56.000,0:22:57.720
That word..

0:22:57.720,0:22:59.500
that they spoke..

0:22:59.500,0:23:03.460
rose above the law of nature.

0:23:03.460,0:23:07.980
and turned the fiery furnace ice cold

0:23:07.980,0:23:11.460
Because that word was spoken from the heart.

0:23:11.460,0:23:14.880
The Word of God in their hearts..

0:23:14.880,0:23:18.820
rose above the law of nature and

0:23:18.820,0:23:24.280
and turned the fiery furnace ice cold.

0:23:24.280,0:23:28.240
So brethren, what is your situation?

0:23:28.240,0:23:33.840
I don't know the unpleasant circumstances that you are facing right now.

0:23:33.840,0:23:39.520
I don't know the mountain surrounding you. I

0:23:39.520,0:23:47.960
I don't know the situation in your career or perhaps you have received a report that says it is incurable

0:23:47.960,0:23:50.360
But I want you to know one thing.

0:23:50.360,0:23:57.540
The Word of God on your lips today as believer would rise against the law of nature..

0:23:57.540,0:24:07.340
and make that  impossibility in your life possible in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:24:07.340,0:24:13.220
Remember the Word of God is sharper than the two edged sword.

0:24:13.220,0:24:18.420
When you experience situations, bretheren, that seem..

0:24:18.420,0:24:22.760
contrary to the promise of God for your life..

0:24:22.760,0:24:30.020
always remember it is an opportunity to cultivate an attitude of Christ Jesus

0:24:30.020,0:24:33.720
Because as far as belief, test and trial will come..

0:24:33.720,0:24:36.300
and when it comes..

0:24:36.300,0:24:45.660
It is an opportunity for you to cultivate an attitude of Christ Jesus. Stay focused.

0:24:45.680,0:24:47.620
Become.

0:24:47.640,0:24:51.140
Don't take a step back.

0:24:51.140,0:24:53.240
Stay steady.

0:24:53.240,0:24:57.200
Even when everything around you is unsteady

0:24:57.200,0:25:07.220
Always remember that there is always light at the end of the tunnel

0:25:07.220,0:25:13.320
You see, the test that comes from Jesus, always helps our character development

0:25:13.320,0:25:17.600
The Bible says:  "God often times use these hard times to produce..

0:25:17.600,0:25:19.520
maturity..

0:25:19.520,0:25:22.060
humility..

0:25:22.060,0:25:26.340
in us.

0:25:26.340,0:25:28.980
God often times uses hard times

0:25:28.980,0:25:30.460
to produce..

0:25:30.460,0:25:37.380
maturity, humility and completeness, in us.

0:25:37.380,0:25:41.260
So that we can share in his holiness..

0:25:41.260,0:25:44.540
and be equipped to enjoy..

0:25:44.540,0:25:51.660
the peace and righteousness in Christ Jesus.

0:25:51.660,0:25:54.620
Viewers all over the world..

0:25:54.620,0:25:58.460
those who are under the influence of these telecasts..

0:25:58.460,0:26:01.840
the way out..

0:26:01.840,0:26:07.400
The first step of our work of faith is to stop our own work.

0:26:07.400,0:26:17.540
To stop our own plan, and rest on God's love, God's power and God's wisdom

0:26:17.540,0:26:20.100
Tests and trials will come..

0:26:20.100,0:26:23.640
as long as we live.

0:26:23.640,0:26:25.940
But when it comes..

0:26:25.940,0:26:29.820
Don't be troubled.

0:26:29.820,0:26:32.620
Be focused.

0:26:32.620,0:26:34.700
Be steady.

0:26:34.700,0:26:40.320
Even when everything around you is unsteady.

0:26:40.320,0:26:42.060
Finally, brethren..

0:26:42.060,0:26:47.420
Turn with me quickly to the Book of Hebrews, chapter 12.

0:26:47.420,0:26:52.180
And let's quickly take our reading from verse

0:26:52.180,0:26:53.740
1 to 2

0:26:53.740,0:27:00.700
"Therefore we also since we are surrounded by so great a cloud..

0:27:00.700,0:27:02.580
of weaknesses.

0:27:02.580,0:27:06.900
Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily..

0:27:06.900,0:27:09.000
ensnares us..

0:27:09.000,0:27:16.120
And let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us."

0:27:16.120,0:27:17.460
verse 2

0:27:17.460,0:27:23.000
"Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith..

0:27:23.000,0:27:27.500
who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross..

0:27:27.500,0:27:29.700
despising the shame..

0:27:29.700,0:27:36.100
that He has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

0:27:36.100,0:27:38.420
Praise the Lord.

0:27:38.440,0:27:41.120
Praise the Lord.

0:27:41.120,0:27:43.280
Brethren..

0:27:43.280,0:27:46.400
it is the right time..

0:27:46.400,0:27:48.520
for you to identify..

0:27:48.520,0:27:55.080
Those things that may hinder your movements towards God.

0:27:55.080,0:27:57.380
We are in the presence of God.

0:27:57.380,0:28:04.580
Remember it is not all up to God and certainly it is not all up to you.

0:28:04.580,0:28:08.560
It is high time that we sit down..

0:28:08.560,0:28:13.860
to identify those things..

0:28:13.980,0:28:19.660
That may hinder our movements towards God.

0:28:19.660,0:28:23.540
It could be impatience.

0:28:23.540,0:28:27.220
It could be disobedience.

0:28:27.220,0:28:28.800
It could be..

0:28:28.800,0:28:31.120
anger.

0:28:31.120,0:28:34.420
It could be insensitive words..

0:28:34.420,0:28:35.840
perhaps..

0:28:35.850,0:28:37.770
hatred.

0:28:37.770,0:28:39.860
Identify them.

0:28:39.860,0:28:48.620
aAnd I pray the Holy Spirit will help our weakness and journey to the strength of God in Jesus name.

0:28:48.620,0:28:51.240
No matter what your yesterday was like..

0:28:51.240,0:28:54.760
tell anybody the best is yet to come.

0:28:54.760,0:28:58.660
No matter what my yesterday was like..

0:28:58.660,0:29:02.040
The best is yet to come.

0:29:02.040,0:29:06.400
Indeed ,the best is yet to come.

0:29:06.400,0:29:08.240
Brethren..

0:29:08.240,0:29:12.420
I want to use this opportunity to thank my father in the Lord..

0:29:12.420,0:29:15.500
whom God is using mightily..

0:29:15.500,0:29:17.980
in the entire world.

0:29:17.980,0:29:21.760
For his endless efforts..

0:29:21.760,0:29:24.200
In my life..

0:29:24.200,0:29:26.200
I never believed..

0:29:26.200,0:29:30.780
I can be part of this glorious grace.

0:29:30.780,0:29:36.300
Because I am an embodiment of the impossible.

0:29:36.300,0:29:39.520
Here I am today.

0:29:39.520,0:29:41.780
All Glory..

0:29:41.780,0:29:42.580
to His name.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:47.900,0:29:50.275
There is hope!

0:29:50.280,0:29:56.420
Brethren, Jesus is the hope.

0:29:56.420,0:29:58.620
That same God...

0:29:58.620,0:30:02.640
that turned my misery into success today..

0:30:02.640,0:30:04.700
That turned my name..

0:30:04.700,0:30:06.280
to success..

0:30:06.280,0:30:11.680
which turned every impossibility in your life possible in the name of Jesus.

0:30:11.680,0:30:14.240
I say that´s the God..

0:30:14.240,0:30:19.580
Who turned your failure to success in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:30:19.580,0:30:24.600
That same God will turn your sickness into good health.

0:30:24.600,0:30:27.060
That same God..

0:30:27.060,0:30:29.700
Who turned your mess..
