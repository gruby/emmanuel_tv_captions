0:00:19.380,0:00:29.340
Who am I that the Lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name

0:00:29.340,0:00:34.800
Would care to feel my hurt

0:00:34.800,0:00:41.280
Who am I that the 
Bright and Morning Star

0:00:41.280,0:00:50.480
Would choose to light the way 
For my ever wandering heart

0:00:50.480,0:00:58.000
It’s not because of who I am 
But because of what You’ve done

0:00:58.000,0:01:06.980
It’s not because of what I’ve done 
But because of who You are

0:01:06.980,0:01:16.020
I am a flower quickly fading 
Here today and gone tomorrow

0:01:16.020,0:01:22.700
A wave tossed in the ocean 
A vapour in the wind

0:01:22.700,0:01:31.420
Still You hear me when I am calling
Lord You catch me when I’m falling

0:01:31.420,0:01:36.920
And You told me who I am

0:01:36.920,0:01:47.020
I am Yours

0:01:47.020,0:01:52.020
If you believe you belong to Jesus - let me see you wave your hands.

0:01:52.020,0:01:58.120
Who am I 
That the eyes that see my sins

0:01:58.120,0:02:06.440
Would look on me with love 
And watch me rise again

0:02:06.440,0:02:13.280
Who am I 
That the voice which calms the sea

0:02:13.280,0:02:21.980
Would call out through the rain 
And calm the storm in me

0:02:21.980,0:02:29.320
It’s not because of who I am 
But because of what You’ve done

0:02:29.320,0:02:37.040
It’s not because of what I’ve done 
But because of who You are

0:02:37.040,0:02:44.560
I am a flower quickly fading 
Here today and gone tomorrow

0:02:44.560,0:02:51.420
A wave tossed in the ocean 
A vapour in the wind

0:02:51.420,0:03:01.460
Still You hear me when I am calling
Lord You catch me when I’m falling

0:03:01.460,0:03:06.080
And You told me who I am
I am Yours

0:03:06.080,0:03:14.640
I am a flower quickly fading 
Here today and gone tomorrow

0:03:14.640,0:03:21.680
A wave tossed in the ocean 
A vapour in the wind

0:03:21.680,0:03:29.220
Still You hear me when I am calling
Lord You catch me when I’m falling

0:03:29.220,0:03:35.740
And You told me who I am
I am Yours

0:03:35.740,0:03:44.180
I am a flower quickly fading 
Here today and gone tomorrow

0:03:44.180,0:03:51.420
A wave tossed in the ocean 
A vapour in the wind

0:03:51.420,0:04:00.340
Still You hear me when I am calling
Lord You catch me when I’m falling

0:04:00.340,0:04:13.160
And You told me who I am
I am Yours

0:04:13.160,0:04:16.360
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:04:27.100,0:04:28.860
Hallelujah.

0:04:28.860,0:04:37.460
Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?

0:04:37.460,0:04:40.540
We bless His Holy Name.

0:04:40.540,0:04:43.280
Hallelujah.

0:04:43.280,0:04:47.940
We oftentimes ignore our conscience.

0:04:47.940,0:04:52.340
We keep talking about the Holy Spirit. There is nothing bad about that.

0:04:52.340,0:04:55.780
We ignore our conscience, our heart,

0:04:55.780,0:04:59.560
but oftentimes we call Holy Spirit, which is good...

0:04:59.560,0:05:06.440
It is the same conscience the the Holy Spirit uses to guide us.

0:05:06.440,0:05:14.560
The Holy Spirit uses our conscience to guide us, to guide our souls.

0:05:14.560,0:05:21.180
If we only call the Holy Spirit, there would be nothing for Holy Spirit to use.

0:05:21.180,0:05:25.100
Take note of your conscience, your heart.

0:05:25.100,0:05:31.200
If your heart is not there for the Holy Spirit, there is nothing the Holy Spirit can do;

0:05:31.200,0:05:34.680
He cannot reach you or contact you.

0:05:34.680,0:05:40.940
All the time we say; "Holy Spirit, God, Holy Spirit, God, Jesus, Holy Spirit",

0:05:40.940,0:05:48.940
but we ignore the fundamentals.

0:05:48.940,0:05:53.000
There is no way He could hit you, greet you, or reach you.

0:05:53.000,0:06:03.460
That is the very instrument that Holy Spirit uses to guide your soul.

0:06:03.460,0:06:07.720
Tell your neighbor: "Don't ignore your conscience".

0:06:07.720,0:06:09.440
I cannot hear you.

0:06:16.280,0:06:19.500
How do we ignore our conscience?

0:06:19.500,0:06:22.640
When you want to pray...

0:06:22.640,0:06:26.840
but you don't knot that before you pray, you need to examine yourself.

0:06:26.840,0:06:31.500
If you don’t examine yourself and you pray, who are you praying to?

0:06:31.500,0:06:39.180
Am I qualified? Am I to pray? What am I doing? Who I am? Where am I coming from?

0:06:39.180,0:06:41.120
You should examine yourself first.

0:06:41.120,0:06:43.400
Sometimes you even may not pray.

0:06:43.400,0:06:46.560
You do the examination.

0:06:46.560,0:06:54.520
It might be only an examination you would do - and just end there.

0:06:54.520,0:06:56.840
You may wake up in the morning,

0:06:56.840,0:07:05.760
look around, and realise that you are on the examination all through.

0:07:05.760,0:07:07.120
Yes.

0:07:07.120,0:07:11.260
But today we wake up, jump up saying; "Jesus - thank You"...

0:07:11.260,0:07:12.600
Yes, good, thank you.

0:07:12.600,0:07:15.820
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, bless me, bless me...

0:07:15.820,0:07:17.320
Who are you praying to?

0:07:17.320,0:07:30.920
Oftentimes, we ignore our conscience, the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit – our heart.

0:07:30.920,0:07:38.240
You can be on the examination, and just end the whole thing like that,

0:07:38.240,0:07:40.960
without even saying; "God help me",

0:07:40.960,0:07:43.520
because you know you are not worthy to even ask for that.

0:07:43.520,0:07:46.000
Because you are on the examination - you need to examine yourself.

0:07:46.000,0:07:47.660
You are not qualified.

0:07:47.660,0:07:51.440
You have to be qualified.

0:07:51.440,0:07:55.440
Tell your neighbor: "Don't ignore your conscience".

0:07:55.440,0:08:06.080
It is very instrument the Holy Spirit Himself uses to guide us, to hear us.

0:08:06.080,0:08:09.640
Yes - the very instrument.

0:08:09.640,0:08:15.980
If you want to enter a forest, you have to make a path.

0:08:15.980,0:08:25.620
If there is no path, and there are thorns everywhere, you would be looking for any available road,

0:08:25.620,0:08:28.420
or path you can follow.

0:08:28.420,0:08:36.660
Until you get that, before you enter the forest - that path is what we call heart.

0:08:36.660,0:08:46.300
In order to have an effective prayer, there must not be anything between you and God.

0:08:46.300,0:08:57.060
This is what we are talking about – holding offences such as anger, bitterness,

0:08:57.060,0:09:01.840
pain of the past and so forth.

0:09:01.840,0:09:06.500
These are the things that live in our hearts.

0:09:06.500,0:09:15.860
This is what we are talking about – conscience, a place where those things live.

0:09:15.860,0:09:21.300
This is why many times you pray, you find out that you are talking to yourself.

0:09:21.300,0:09:23.860
Don’t ignore your conscience.

0:09:23.860,0:09:35.080
The Book of Romans 9:1 says, our conscience is the communication point. That is, the contact point.

0:09:35.080,0:09:36.940
It is what?

0:09:36.940,0:09:39.220
I cannot hear you.

0:09:39.220,0:09:42.400
That is a contact point.

0:09:42.400,0:09:46.560
If I cannot contact this place I cannot get to the next place.

0:09:46.560,0:09:52.200
That is your heart. If God doesn't contact this place, He cannot touch your soul.

0:09:52.200,0:09:53.880
He cannot guide your soul.

0:09:53.880,0:09:55.300
He cannot guide you.

0:09:55.300,0:09:56.680
Let me put it this way.

0:09:56.680,0:10:01.560
If God does not contact you in your heart - He cannot guide you.

0:10:01.560,0:10:03.340
He cannot talk to you.

0:10:03.340,0:10:05.740
That is your heart.

0:10:05.740,0:10:12.680
You can call it your spirit."Heart" means the spirit of man.

0:10:12.680,0:10:15.580
But we often ignore it.

0:10:15.580,0:10:25.920
We call the Holy Spirit to come, whereas our heart is full of evil.

0:10:26.060,0:10:29.240
Offence, anger...

0:10:29.240,0:10:31.400
Holy Spirit, come down...

0:10:31.400,0:10:37.780
Let's assume that the Holy Spirit comes down. He would be just moving around, because

0:10:37.780,0:10:42.800
a place of contact is dead.

0:10:42.800,0:10:46.880
Is dead.

0:10:46.880,0:11:00.700
This is why you are able to look upon pain, wrong and injustice towards your neighbor unaffected.

0:11:00.700,0:11:06.280
You look at your neighbor - let him die, it does not concern me.

0:11:11.900,0:11:22.740
You just look upon pain, wrong, injustice towards your neighbour unaffected.

0:11:22.740,0:11:24.240
Let him die.

0:11:24.240,0:11:25.960
Foolish him.

0:11:25.960,0:11:28.460
It is a stupid man.

0:11:28.460,0:11:33.720
Or you enjoy seeing your neighbour being in trouble - good.

0:11:33.720,0:11:36.820
Yes - it is good for him.

0:11:36.820,0:11:40.380
It is just good for him.

0:11:40.380,0:11:47.640
You conscience is dead.

0:11:47.640,0:11:56.320
If your conscience is alive to God, if you hear that your greatest enemy is in problem,

0:11:56.320,0:12:02.960
you will start crying, thinking of how to rescue him.

0:12:02.960,0:12:21.280
If your conscience is alive to God and your greatest enemy is in trouble, you will cry and seek a way

0:12:21.280,0:12:24.660
to rescue him.

0:12:24.660,0:12:33.560
You will be the first person to run to him, to rescue him.

0:12:33.560,0:12:41.920
You are able to pay evil for evil because your conscience is dead.

0:12:49.820,0:13:00.580
You are able to hold unforgiveness, offence because your conscience is dead.

0:13:00.580,0:13:04.280
Don't you know that

0:13:04.280,0:13:08.060
as a Christian, your situation could be any foolish thing.

0:13:08.060,0:13:14.720
Your situation is used to preserve you.

0:13:14.720,0:13:16.420
That is what God normally uses.

0:13:16.420,0:13:25.840
It is not a joy or pleasure but a situation is what God often uses to preserve us,

0:13:25.840,0:13:30.560
to keep us for a new level, to reform us.

0:13:30.560,0:13:37.920
You were able to come to the  Synagogue today because of your situation.

0:13:37.920,0:13:43.520
Is not because of joy that you come here.

0:13:43.520,0:13:46.220
It is one thing or another;

0:13:46.220,0:13:54.620
you either come here to give the testimony of the situation God rescued you from, or you are here ...

0:13:54.620,0:13:57.740
Is it not a preservation?

0:13:57.740,0:14:02.680
Is it not reforming you for better position?

0:14:02.680,0:14:06.160
Is it not a blessing?

0:14:06.160,0:14:17.480
Our situation is not our enemy but our friend.

0:14:17.480,0:14:24.360
Your situation is not your enemy but your friend.

0:14:24.360,0:14:30.020
It is your situation that still keeps you going with God.

0:14:30.020,0:14:44.420
Many of us here, when faced with release, abundant joy - God would likely lose you.

0:14:44.420,0:14:49.380
Strength often comes through situations.

0:14:49.380,0:14:52.480
It is not through joy, enjoyment.

0:14:52.480,0:14:57.560
Strength often comes through what?

0:14:57.560,0:14:59.520
Situation.

0:14:59.520,0:15:01.460
Strength.

0:15:01.460,0:15:12.340
I can do all things through God, who strengthens me through situation.

0:15:12.340,0:15:16.360
Don't ignore your conscience.

0:15:16.360,0:15:28.580
Anytime to pray or talk to God, it is time to look inward to see whether you are right or wrong

0:15:28.580,0:15:32.500
before you pray.

0:15:32.500,0:15:41.320
You look inward to see whether you are right or wrong before you pray.

0:15:41.320,0:15:44.680
Don't ignore your conscience.

0:15:44.700,0:16:00.000
Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you.

0:16:00.000,0:16:04.600
Tell you neighbor: "Don't ignore your conscience".

0:16:04.600,0:16:21.800
Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you.

0:16:21.800,0:16:31.720
There must not be anything between you and God if you want an effective prayer.

0:16:31.720,0:16:48.900
Holding offences such as bitterness, anger and so forth are the wall between you and God.

0:16:48.900,0:16:52.080
Wall - you build wall.

0:16:52.080,0:17:00.280
God is here, you are here. Offence between you.

0:17:00.280,0:17:07.080
I do not want you to waste your energy in offering a prayer.

0:17:07.080,0:17:19.480
Tell your neighbour: "Don’t waste your energy and effort in prayer; your conscience should not be ignored".

0:17:19.480,0:17:28.400
If you ignore your conscience you are wasting your time.

0:17:28.400,0:17:37.080
This is why anytime cannot be the best time for a true man of God to pray for you.

0:17:37.080,0:17:39.120
God always allots time.

0:17:39.120,0:17:42.700
They need a corresponding power to pray.

0:17:42.700,0:17:45.320
Corresponding power to pray.

0:17:45.320,0:17:47.320
Not any time is the best time to pray.

0:17:47.320,0:17:53.700
You cannot just rush and ask; "man of God - pray for me".

0:17:53.700,0:17:57.700
This is common today.

0:17:57.700,0:18:05.680
You rush to your man of God; "Man of God, please pray for me, in Jesus' name, amen"...

0:18:05.680,0:18:12.900
No, any time cannot be the best time.

0:18:12.900,0:18:25.700
When Jesus was called to the fest, to demonstrate that He was Messiah, Jesus answered:

0:18:25.700,0:18:31.000
"not any time is the best time for me, but any time can be the best for you,

0:18:31.000,0:18:36.640
to do whatever you want to do. But me - I need a corresponding grace,

0:18:36.640,0:18:41.060
before I can do what you ask me to do".

0:18:41.060,0:18:44.740
He said, "No, I am not going".

0:18:44.740,0:18:52.960
He said, "My time has not yet come".

0:18:52.960,0:19:01.080
If you rush to me asking for a prayer - I have to examine my conscience before praying for you.

0:19:01.080,0:19:03.720
That is why you cannot just rush to me, and I will pray.

0:19:03.720,0:19:16.620
Because I need to go back to my conscience to see if I am in a position to pray or I need to do some restitution.

0:19:16.620,0:19:21.760
Imagine that I just saw somebody in a pool of blood.

0:19:21.880,0:19:28.720
Oh my God - I feel it.

0:19:28.720,0:19:31.240
My conscience is disturbed now.

0:19:31.240,0:19:36.460
And somebody meets me and say, "man of God - pray for me",

0:19:36.460,0:19:39.060
when my conscience is not at its best.

0:19:39.060,0:19:46.260
It is when our conscience is at its best that we can pray.

0:19:46.260,0:19:48.380
When your conscience is at its best.

0:19:48.380,0:19:52.760
You know when conscience is at its best...

0:19:52.760,0:19:59.440
you don't have anything to think about, to worry about - then you can offer a prayer.

0:19:59.440,0:20:03.820
There are certain things you ignore, you don't know.

0:20:03.820,0:20:10.760
OK, like you wake up in the morning, after having a serious nightmare.

0:20:10.760,0:20:14.720
Maybe somebody abused you or hit you...

0:20:14.720,0:20:17.180
You just wake up.

0:20:17.180,0:20:21.400
Oh my God, this was a nightmare.

0:20:21.400,0:20:23.960
You say, "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus".

0:20:23.960,0:20:27.820
Whom are rebuking, when your mind is disturbed?

0:20:27.820,0:20:33.200
Whatever you say at that moment it would be filtered through your worries.

0:20:33.200,0:20:35.020
What you need to do is to counsel yourself.

0:20:35.020,0:20:45.340
You wake up and say, "This was a nightmare. God I cancel it in Jesus' name. Thank you."

0:20:45.340,0:20:47.680
You have to make yourself happy.

0:20:47.680,0:20:51.860
You have to remember the message you have received in the past,

0:20:51.860,0:20:56.000
that when you are weak then you are strong.

0:20:56.000,0:21:00.840
You have to remember all this.

0:21:00.840,0:21:06.100
You have to recall immediately those messages.

0:21:06.100,0:21:09.780
Yes.

0:21:09.780,0:21:18.120
When you come to your senses, because when you lose control,

0:21:18.120,0:21:24.240
the first thing satan does to make you his disciple is to make you lose control.

0:21:24.240,0:21:29.500
When you lose control, you start misbehaving.

0:21:29.500,0:21:35.700
If you don’t lose control, satan cannot use you as a disciple or servant.

0:21:35.700,0:21:42.920
When you lose control, he takes you as a disciple, and uses you.

0:21:42.920,0:21:49.440
If you don't lose control, you reason well.

0:21:49.440,0:21:51.720
But when you lose control you cannot reason well.

0:21:51.720,0:21:59.500
Then he takes you as a disciple, and he can use you as an errand boy to be sent anywhere he wants you to go.

0:21:59.500,0:22:05.000
That is why he uses offence to make you lose control.

0:22:05.000,0:22:09.740
Offence is the instrument that makes you lose control.

0:22:09.740,0:22:12.800
When offence comes, you lose control.

0:22:12.800,0:22:17.120
"Why all this?, I don't know..."

0:22:17.120,0:22:20.220
You have lost control.

0:22:20.220,0:22:29.180
Then satan comes, and you start doing the work of satan.

0:22:29.180,0:22:33.180
With bitterness in your heart, you lose control.

0:22:33.180,0:22:44.100
With anger, you lose control.

0:22:44.100,0:22:49.060
It is when satan takes us as his disciples.

0:22:49.060,0:22:50.740
You have to help.

0:22:50.740,0:22:55.280
Those of you who listen to this message; "Don't disturb men of God".

0:22:55.280,0:22:56.600
You attend them a lot.

0:22:56.600,0:23:00.720
You see man of God sitting down and laughing.

0:23:00.720,0:23:02.280
You say, "man of God - pray for me".

0:23:02.280,0:23:03.900
Ha.

0:23:03.900,0:23:06.880
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:06.880,0:23:11.580
You meet a man of God on his way and ask, "Man of God - pray for me".

0:23:11.580,0:23:17.560
Do you know where the man of God is coming from?

0:23:17.560,0:23:19.440
In the same way; you cannot jump into a prayer.

0:23:19.440,0:23:22.580
You need to pause to examine your conscience.

0:23:22.580,0:23:25.500
Man of God has to do the same.

0:23:25.500,0:23:27.460
Our own is too serious.

0:23:27.460,0:23:32.840
We need corresponding power to do anything.

0:23:32.840,0:23:35.560
"Man of God - pray for me"

0:23:35.560,0:23:42.320
We need to examine our hearts before we offer a prayer – effective prayer.

0:23:42.320,0:23:53.340
Because if there is something between us and God, we cannot offer a prayer to God.

0:23:53.340,0:23:59.400
Take this message home, and I know you will re-address yourself.

0:23:59.400,0:24:02.420
You cannot just jump into prayer.

0:24:02.420,0:24:11.680
This is why people who want to pray start with worship.

0:24:11.680,0:24:16.340
They are doing it for to prepare their heart before going to prayer.

0:24:16.340,0:24:20.140
They worship.

0:24:20.140,0:24:25.980
They are using that to prepare their hearts before going to prayer.

0:24:25.980,0:24:37.980
The Bible says in this world there will be offence; take heart, I have overcome.

0:24:37.980,0:24:41.140
Take heart means - don't hold an offence.

0:24:41.140,0:24:44.100
There will be an offence - but do not hold it.

0:24:44.100,0:24:47.720
Offence will come - let it go, don't hold it.

0:24:47.720,0:24:51.140
The word H O L D.

0:24:51.140,0:24:52.100
Don't hold it.

0:24:52.100,0:25:01.740
When something is passing and I hold it - it can become an instrument to be used,

0:25:01.740,0:25:05.140
but when it comes, I'll allow it to go.

0:25:05.140,0:25:13.620
This is what the Bible says: in this world there will be an offence.

0:25:13.620,0:25:19.300
The offence will come - but do not hold it.

0:25:19.300,0:25:28.260
When it comes, allow it to go.

0:25:28.260,0:25:36.660
In this world it is not possible for you and me to live without an offence.

0:25:36.660,0:25:40.100
Don't hold it.

0:25:40.100,0:25:41.840
Don't hold an offence.

0:25:41.840,0:25:44.800
It will come.

0:25:44.800,0:25:48.540
Let it go.

0:25:48.540,0:25:53.800
This is why you have to examine yourself.

0:25:53.800,0:25:59.640
Don't ignore your conscience.

0:25:59.640,0:26:11.420
Your conscience is the very instrument used to guide you by the Holy Spirit.

0:26:16.980,0:26:24.340
Tell your neighbour once again: "don't ignore your conscience".

0:26:24.340,0:26:37.900
It is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you.

0:26:37.900,0:26:47.560
It is like playing a ball. Even the best player cannot start to play without the ball on his feet.

0:26:47.560,0:26:52.140
If there is no ball - what are you playing?

0:26:52.140,0:27:01.080
In the same way the Holy Spirit cannot get to you without your conscience.

0:27:01.080,0:27:07.100
This is why the Bible says: "faith is of man's heart".

0:27:07.100,0:27:22.260
Only faith pleases God; faith is of man's heart.

0:27:22.260,0:27:25.720
It means it is of man's spirit.

0:27:25.720,0:27:29.480
So please, take care of yourself.

0:27:29.480,0:27:31.460
Take your pen.

0:27:31.460,0:27:49.240
People look upon pain, wrong and injustice towards their neighbours, unaffected.

0:27:49.240,0:27:52.520
Tell your neighbour again,

0:27:52.520,0:28:03.560
People look upon pain, wrong and injustice towards their neighbours, unaffected.

0:28:03.560,0:28:12.940
Your neighbour could be your enemy, friend, those who do not share the same faith with you.

0:28:12.940,0:28:15.420
The Bible says, love them all.

0:28:15.420,0:28:23.560
But because they don't share the same faith with you, when you see them having a problem you ignore them.

0:28:23.560,0:28:25.700
You look the other side.

0:28:25.700,0:28:28.360
Because they don't share the same faith with you.

0:28:28.360,0:28:30.220
You are a Christian, they are not Christians.

0:28:30.220,0:28:34.840
Whatever problem they have, you would look the other side.

0:28:34.840,0:28:37.400
No.

0:28:37.400,0:28:42.760
You have to rescue. Love your neighbour as yourself.

0:28:42.760,0:28:57.460
If your spirit, heart or conscience is alive to Christ, you would always be there for your neighbour.

0:28:57.460,0:29:01.880
Tell you neighbour,

0:29:01.880,0:29:09.220
If your conscience is alive to Christ, you would always be there for your neighbour.

0:29:09.220,0:29:13.520
Love your neighbour as yourself.

0:29:13.520,0:29:22.320
When you learn that he is in the hospital - you say, my prayer has been answered.

0:29:22.320,0:29:24.880
What kind of prayer is that?

0:29:24.880,0:29:26.300
He is in the hospital? ...

0:29:34.160,0:29:38.560
No.

0:29:38.560,0:29:41.120
If it is your enemy...

0:29:41.120,0:29:54.260
The Bible says: "I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy".

0:29:54.260,0:30:00.520
If your enemy is not there, the table will be useless.

0:30:06.880,0:30:09.620
If your enemy does not live any longer,

0:30:09.620,0:30:15.820
and the table is set before you, with the essence of life on it,

0:30:15.820,0:30:20.820
it is good for your enemy to see what you've become.

0:30:20.820,0:30:27.280
It is good for your enemy to see, that you have become that, what they had thought you wouldn't have.

0:30:33.860,0:30:39.820
The thought - you cannot become this or that,

0:30:39.820,0:30:43.820
it is better to see for themselves.

0:30:43.820,0:30:46.200
That may change them.

0:30:46.200,0:30:49.000
You can win their soul.

0:30:49.000,0:30:58.800
But all that deadness in the heart; die, kill...

0:30:58.800,0:31:03.080
"I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy. "

0:31:03.080,0:31:19.040
There is an essence of life on the table. Those things you need for life; peace, comfort, prosperity.

0:31:19.040,0:31:24.480
Us being here today is a good example of what we are talking about.

0:31:24.480,0:31:33.260
If we begin to examine the hearts, the consciences of everyone here,

0:31:33.260,0:31:40.180
at least forty to fifty percent of you never thought they would come here.

0:31:40.180,0:31:43.840
You had a different impression about T.B.Joshua.

0:31:43.840,0:31:51.580
You were in opposition to T.B.Joshua in the past.

0:31:51.580,0:31:56.780
But today you are alive to see that it is your friend.

0:31:56.780,0:31:58.720
It is not your enemy.

0:32:03.080,0:32:09.080
If you had died, would you be able to see this?

0:32:09.080,0:32:14.120
If I have died then, would I be here today?

0:32:14.120,0:32:21.620
"I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy."

0:32:21.620,0:32:25.020
What is the way out?

0:32:25.020,0:32:28.240
Ask me for the way out for you.

0:32:28.240,0:32:30.040
I want to hear your voice.

0:32:30.040,0:32:31.900
What is the way out?

0:32:31.900,0:32:42.280
Pray for your enemy.

0:32:42.280,0:32:46.680
I repeat. Ask me again.

0:32:46.680,0:32:48.560
Pray for your enemy.

0:32:48.560,0:32:54.160
Prayer from your heart, not from your lips.

0:32:54.160,0:32:56.960
From your heart.

0:32:56.960,0:33:00.060
Down from your heart.

0:33:00.060,0:33:01.880
Ask me again.

0:33:01.880,0:33:03.120
What is the way out?

0:33:03.120,0:33:09.320
Pray for your enemy.

0:33:09.320,0:33:16.520
If you chose the path of praying for your enemy you will have a great relief.

0:33:16.520,0:33:28.800
In running to defeat your enemies, you have been to many places, spiritually, physically, morally, financially.

0:33:28.800,0:33:33.200
You spent a lot of money.

0:33:33.200,0:33:43.840
It provoked sleepless nights, fear, anxiety, pressure.

0:33:43.840,0:33:52.380
You put the blame for every nightmare on your enemy.

0:33:52.380,0:33:56.400
The pain you go through, is not suffered by your enemy.

0:33:56.400,0:33:58.480
It is you who is going through the pain.

0:33:58.480,0:34:05.240
Why can't you ignore your enemy and move forward? Pray for them!

0:34:08.760,0:34:12.040
You are the one that experience the pain.

0:34:12.040,0:34:18.780
If somebody curses you saying, "I curse your leg".

0:34:18.780,0:34:23.080
And immediately you start walking like this.

0:34:23.080,0:34:30.080
You are going through the pain|, and at the same time you pursue your enemy.

0:34:30.080,0:34:31.700
You are going through the pain.

0:34:31.700,0:34:41.600
At the same time you are fighting the person who cursed your leg.

0:34:41.600,0:34:44.100
There are two battles.

0:34:44.100,0:34:45.180
You walk like this.

0:34:45.180,0:34:54.400
You follow and curse the man who cursed your leg.

0:34:54.400,0:34:57.700
Oh Jesus - I curse him.

0:34:57.700,0:35:04.600
When you begin to chase your enemy, you automatically forget your condition

0:35:04.600,0:35:08.300
in which you are.

0:35:08.300,0:35:15.520
It is not possible to look in two directions at the same time.

0:35:15.520,0:35:20.240
When I am looking here, I cannot look there at the same time.

0:35:20.240,0:35:30.780
So, If I am going through pain, that that enemy has caused...

0:35:30.780,0:35:43.900
If I focus on pursue after my enemy, I would ignore taking care of myself.

0:35:43.900,0:35:49.100
This is why your situation is persistent.

0:35:49.100,0:35:57.780
The situation you were supposed to go through within one week, lasts one year.

0:35:57.780,0:36:08.900
It is because you ignore your condition, and you are pursuing your enemy.

0:36:08.900,0:36:13.820
Enemy is something that you should define.

0:36:13.820,0:36:15.360
I'm here,

0:36:15.360,0:36:17.000
here is my enemy.

0:36:17.000,0:36:24.900
If I now ask for progress, and I receive it - I will meet my enemy in that position again; I've left that enemy.

0:36:24.900,0:36:30.620
The bigger your success, the bigger your enemy.

0:36:30.620,0:36:33.740
Why are you wasting your time when you know it is a normal life.

0:36:33.740,0:36:36.500
It is a normal thing, a way of life.

0:36:36.500,0:36:42.700
My trials are different from your trials, because of my position.

0:36:42.700,0:36:44.980
I will not go through your trial.

0:36:44.980,0:36:48.160
You will go through the trials according to your position.

0:36:48.160,0:36:54.220
And I will go through my trials according to my position.

0:36:54.220,0:36:57.700
It is our position that attracts trials.

0:36:57.700,0:37:00.520
What attracts trials?

0:37:00.520,0:37:02.880
I cannot hear you.

0:37:02.880,0:37:04.860
It is our position that attracts trials.

0:37:04.860,0:37:09.260
OK, you are in the university, secondary degree.

0:37:09.260,0:37:13.900
They will not send primary school teacher to you.

0:37:13.900,0:37:19.080
To come and inspect your job.

0:37:19.080,0:37:21.740
It is not possible.

0:37:21.740,0:37:27.560
They will send a professor or PhD that can supervise you,

0:37:27.560,0:37:30.800
not a primary or secondary school teacher.

0:37:30.800,0:37:33.140
In the same way

0:37:33.140,0:37:38.980
your position in life attracts persecution and trials.

0:37:38.980,0:37:44.380
If your position is big, it will attract big trials.

0:37:44.380,0:37:49.380
If your position is small, it will attract small trials.

0:37:49.380,0:37:53.220
And you always pray for big position, big blessing.

0:37:53.220,0:38:01.480
That big blessing will attract a big trial.

0:38:01.480,0:38:08.240
If you do not want trial, you do not want a success in life.

0:38:08.240,0:38:18.060
When they speak bad of you,

0:38:18.060,0:38:24.100
you know it is a recognition.

0:38:29.140,0:38:35.200
They ignore people that do nothing.

0:38:35.200,0:38:45.360
If president enters here now, everybody would stand to look.

0:38:45.360,0:38:48.680
There would be an attention because of his position.

0:38:48.680,0:38:50.760
But if you enter nobody would look at you.

0:38:50.760,0:38:54.620
They would say, "please, go back".

0:38:54.620,0:38:55.640
They would say, "go back".

0:38:55.640,0:39:01.120
The usher would not even let you to enter.

0:39:01.120,0:39:05.120
What we are trying to say is that,

0:39:05.120,0:39:12.600
what you are going through should not rule your life.

0:39:12.600,0:39:20.920
What you are going through does not matter but what matters is whom you are.

0:39:20.920,0:39:28.000
It is your situation that has subjected you to what you are today.

0:39:28.000,0:39:34.960
Sometimes you can observe people talking to themselves.

0:39:34.960,0:39:39.060
You think they have a mental problem. It is not a mental problem.

0:39:39.060,0:39:45.620
It is a result of their situation.

0:39:45.620,0:39:51.580
You see people walking and laughing.

0:39:51.580,0:39:53.960
It is not because of the mental problem.

0:39:53.960,0:39:58.420
There is a lot of people on the street that you think are mental - they are not.

0:39:58.420,0:40:03.640
It is a result of the overwhelming situation.

0:40:03.640,0:40:08.560
When your situation overwhelms you, you lose control.

0:40:08.560,0:40:13.500
You become satan's disciple.

0:40:13.500,0:40:20.300
Viewers, wherever you are, listen to me.

0:40:20.300,0:40:24.840
Don't ignore your conscience.

0:40:24.840,0:40:40.740
Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you, to hear your prayer.

0:40:40.740,0:40:47.600
Matthew 5:8 - "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God"

0:40:47.600,0:40:51.060
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God"

0:40:51.060,0:40:52.080
Say it again.

0:40:52.080,0:40:56.380
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God"

0:40:56.380,0:40:57.100
I cannot hear you.

0:40:57.100,0:41:01.300
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God"

0:41:01.300,0:41:02.580
Think about that.

0:41:02.580,0:41:11.340
Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall see God.

0:41:11.340,0:41:17.440
Our heart is the very instrument used by the Holy Ghost.

0:41:17.440,0:41:27.120
If you ignore it, you ignore God; if you ignore it, you ignore the Holy Spirit.

0:41:27.120,0:41:35.500
When it is a time to pray - it a time to examine yourself first.

0:41:35.500,0:41:38.660
The time to pray is the time to do what?

0:41:42.380,0:41:47.800
You have this. This is a mean of examination.

0:41:47.800,0:41:52.540
This is to prepare your way.

0:41:52.540,0:42:00.960
This will help your heart to contact the Holy Spirit.

0:42:00.960,0:42:02.320
Yes.

0:42:02.320,0:42:07.000
It will take you out and take you in.

0:42:07.000,0:42:13.480
There is nothing to say to people that hold it, "take more of me".

0:42:13.480,0:42:20.740
It is a way to examine your heart.

0:42:20.740,0:42:25.580
"Take more of me, give me more You" - it means you are more of yourself.

0:42:25.580,0:42:30.820
If you are more of yourself, you are finished - you are losing control.

0:42:30.820,0:42:34.580
If we are more of ourselves, we become satan's servants.

0:42:34.580,0:42:41.060
"Take more of me, give me more of You"; more of Your faithfulness, Your kindness, Your goodness,

0:42:41.060,0:42:47.480
Your holiness, Your humility. Lord Jesus - take more of me, give me more of You.

0:42:47.480,0:42:49.400
More of You.

0:42:49.400,0:42:53.980
You can know.

0:42:53.980,0:43:01.320
With our heart we know Jesus is righteous.

0:43:01.320,0:43:10.900
With our heart we know Jesus heals, blesses, saves and delivers.

0:43:10.900,0:43:13.040
It is not with our eyes we see.

0:43:13.040,0:43:17.540
Some people would say: "I want to see that healing".

0:43:17.540,0:43:24.120
Even when you see the healing taking place, you will not receive it.

0:43:27.480,0:43:33.920
You would say: "It happened to some people, but it never happened to me. That thing is not working for me."

0:43:33.920,0:43:35.320
No.

0:43:35.320,0:43:44.620
It is not with our eyes but with our hearts we know Jesus is righteous.

0:43:44.620,0:43:51.460
And we are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

0:43:51.460,0:43:52.300
Let somebody say;

0:43:52.300,0:43:59.940
With our heart we know Jesus is righteous.

0:43:59.940,0:44:09.860
We know Jesus heals, saves, blesses, delivers with our hearts.

0:44:09.860,0:44:16.060
If you can not see with your heart, you cannot receive from God.

0:44:16.060,0:44:23.320
With your heart, you receive healing, blessing, deliverance.

0:44:23.320,0:44:25.340
Not seeing it with our eyes.

0:44:30.660,0:44:42.980
With our heart, we walk with the Lord, we see the Lord, praise Him and pray.

0:44:42.980,0:44:48.140
The Bible says that Christianity lies in the heart.

0:44:48.140,0:44:52.140
Let some say; "Christianity lies in the heart".

0:44:52.140,0:44:53.060
Again.

0:44:53.060,0:44:54.880
"Christianity lies in the heart"

0:44:54.880,0:44:56.380
That is it.

0:44:56.380,0:44:58.840
But you do not know this.

0:44:58.840,0:45:08.540
You say, "T.B. Joshua, I want to see with my eyes."

0:45:08.540,0:45:10.460
I want to see.

0:45:10.460,0:45:16.060
When I say be healed, they will examine their hand.

0:45:16.060,0:45:18.520
How many times he said "be healed"?

0:45:18.800,0:45:24.960
"Be healed", "be healed" - oh, two times - let me write it down.

0:45:24.960,0:45:33.620
After that he turned right. I will write it.

0:45:33.620,0:45:42.840
Look at the way he walks. This is the way he walks - let me write it down.

0:45:42.840,0:45:47.780
After that healing he laughed - let me write it.

0:45:47.780,0:45:58.140
So now, you will imitate. Be healed! Be healed!

0:46:03.680,0:46:05.360
Can you see?

0:46:05.360,0:46:06.640
With eyes?

0:46:06.640,0:46:10.040
No.

0:46:10.040,0:46:19.220
With our heart we know Jesus is righteous.

0:46:19.220,0:46:21.840
So, in this case,

0:46:21.840,0:46:28.380
if we know in out heart that Jesus is righteous, it means not all people that call the name of Jesus

0:46:28.380,0:46:31.380
belong to Jesus.

0:46:31.380,0:46:39.460
Because one can say "Jesus" not with the heart.

0:46:39.460,0:46:46.200
This is so difficult for ignorants to know who is following Jesus.

0:46:46.200,0:46:50.940
It is so difficult for ignorants today to know the true pastor.

0:46:50.940,0:46:55.840
It is so difficult for ignorants to know the true Church of God.

0:46:55.840,0:47:02.340
And 99% of the people in the world are ignorants.

0:47:06.080,0:47:08.580
You want me to repeat?

0:47:08.580,0:47:18.420
99% of the people in the world are ignorants when it comes to the things of the Spirit.

0:47:21.260,0:47:22.640
I repeat again.

0:47:22.640,0:47:34.100
When it comes to the things of the Spirit, heavenly things - 99% of the people of the world are ignorants.

0:47:34.100,0:47:36.280
How would they know the true Church?

0:47:36.280,0:47:38.500
How would they know the true ministers of God?

0:47:38.500,0:47:40.840
How would they know the true worshipper?

0:47:40.840,0:47:48.420
How would they know the true person? How would they know who is who?

0:47:54.520,0:47:58.700
This is where we find ourselves.

0:47:58.700,0:48:04.860
We find ourselves in a very big situation.

0:48:04.860,0:48:11.220
What matters most to God is your heart.

0:48:11.220,0:48:12.100
Write it down.

0:48:12.100,0:48:19.860
What matters most to God is your heart.

0:48:19.860,0:48:28.520
Because your heart is the contact point.

0:48:28.520,0:48:29.580
Write it down.

0:48:29.580,0:48:36.700
Because your heart is the contact point.

0:48:36.700,0:48:40.300
You have to guide your heart,

0:48:40.300,0:48:44.980
because your heart is the contact point.

0:48:44.980,0:48:52.760
Before you call Jesus, take care of your heart first.

0:48:52.760,0:49:03.300
How do you take care of your heart? By looking to see if you are holding offences

0:49:03.300,0:49:10.740
such as bitterness, anger, hatred, pain of the past and so forth.

0:49:10.740,0:49:31.620
If you do, don't be surprised if the Bible is no longer real for you.

0:49:31.620,0:49:35.240
It means that the value is no longer there.

0:49:35.240,0:49:41.340
When you open the Bible and you fall asleep, you know there is something wrong with you.

0:49:41.340,0:49:45.480
You open the Bible, you want to read. You start sleeping.

0:49:45.480,0:49:53.140
Don't be surprised if the Bible is no longer a value.

0:49:53.140,0:49:55.960
It will become a literature.

0:49:56.120,0:50:04.420
If you hold an offence, pain of the past, and you open the Bible, you are reading literature, not the Bible.

0:50:04.420,0:50:12.420
If you keep the pain of the past, bitterness, hatred, offence, you are not happy, you are disturbed

0:50:12.420,0:50:18.260
and you open the Bible you are reading literature, history, not the Bible.

0:50:18.260,0:50:22.500
When you are reading the Bible you are reading the Holy Spirit.

0:50:22.500,0:50:25.560
You are looking at yourself and He is looking at you.

0:50:25.560,0:50:28.480
The Bible is the mirror.

0:50:28.480,0:50:32.260
When you look at the mirror you see yourself.

0:50:32.260,0:50:36.360
But the Bible is no longer a mirror to you.

0:50:36.360,0:50:39.020
Tell your neighbour,

0:50:39.020,0:50:41.420
The Holy Bible is a mirror.

0:50:41.420,0:50:46.240
That is M I R R O R.

0:50:46.240,0:50:53.300
When you take a mirror, and you look at yourself, look through it, you will see yourself.

0:50:53.300,0:50:57.160
How you look like.

0:50:57.160,0:51:02.120
When you are reading the Bible, you are looking at yourself.

0:51:02.120,0:51:06.720
But usually we hold offences all the time.

0:51:06.720,0:51:14.300
When we read the Bible while holding an offence, the Bible is no longer real, it cannot be real.

0:51:14.300,0:51:16.480
Let me tell you about the Bible.

0:51:16.480,0:51:21.300
Holy men were carried along by the Holy Spirit to write the Word you see in the Bible

0:51:21.300,0:51:24.300
They were carried along to write what you are reading.

0:51:24.300,0:51:34.660
When you want to read, you must also be carried along, when your heart is free.

0:51:34.660,0:51:40.540
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
