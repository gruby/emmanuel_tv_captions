0:00:02.660,0:00:09.200
When we resist the devil with a lively, active faith, satan would flee before us.

0:00:09.200,0:00:13.460
A believer is one who believes what it takes to cast out satan.

0:00:13.460,0:00:18.820
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, come out!

0:00:18.820,0:00:21.280
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, out!

0:00:21.280,0:00:22.740
Out!

0:00:22.740,0:00:25.920
Come out!

0:00:25.920,0:00:37.520
In the mighty name of Jesus, out!

0:00:40.480,0:00:47.800
It takes the authority in the name Jesus to command satan and direct him where to go.

0:00:47.800,0:00:55.280
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:55.280,0:01:00.900
Out!

0:01:19.800,0:01:22.640
His power and authority have not stopped,

0:01:22.640,0:01:25.520
just because He is no longer visible in our midst.

0:01:25.520,0:01:28.260
Just as it was, so it is.

0:01:28.260,0:01:32.280
Can you see why the work of God is delicate?

0:01:32.280,0:01:36.640
This is a stiff opposition.

0:01:36.640,0:01:41.580
If you are not heard by God, you will be heard by satan.

0:01:41.580,0:01:44.120
If you cannot deliver her, she will deliver you.

0:01:44.120,0:01:48.220
This is to tell you that we are not fighting a natural situation.

0:01:58.900,0:02:01.560
Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Man of God!

0:02:01.560,0:02:05.300
My name is Stella Erasmus. I'm from South Africa.

0:02:05.300,0:02:07.620
I was demon possessed.

0:02:07.620,0:02:12.800
Because of the demon inside of me, it was impossible for me

0:02:12.800,0:02:16.340
even to walk up to my husband, give him a hug and tell him I love him.

0:02:16.340,0:02:22.200
I couldn't do it.

0:02:22.200,0:02:28.860
All the things I want to do, I didn't do and all the things I didn't want to do, I do.

0:02:28.860,0:02:32.340
But then I came to The SCOAN.

0:02:32.340,0:02:39.720
While I was here, the prophet was walking up and down, praying for people.

0:02:39.720,0:02:44.440
The demon inside of me grabbed hold of the chair.

0:02:44.440,0:02:50.060
I wanted to attack Prophet T.B. Joshua but the authority of God

0:02:50.060,0:02:54.060
in him was so powerful, so mighty.

0:02:54.060,0:02:56.980
It was impossible.

0:02:56.980,0:02:59.960
He used the authority in God.

0:02:59.960,0:03:06.880
I was down on the floor and he delivered me from the demon.

0:03:06.880,0:03:11.160
I thank God that he delivered me from that demon.

0:03:11.160,0:03:13.580
Thank You, Jesus. I am free.

0:03:13.580,0:03:24.500
TESTIMONY TIME

0:03:24.500,0:03:30.580
We welcome you here to The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, in Jesus' name.

0:03:30.580,0:03:33.640
Madam, please tell us your name and your age.

0:03:33.640,0:03:36.500
My name is Stella Erasmus. I am 37 years old.

0:03:36.500,0:03:41.460
We saw you at the prayer line yesterday being prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:03:41.460,0:03:44.020
Can you explain to us why you were in the prayer line?

0:03:44.020,0:03:46.120
I was demon possessed.

0:03:46.120,0:03:58.720
The demon - his face was like a triangle and his eyes were far apart.

0:03:58.720,0:04:05.560
Where his eyes were, there were also horns -

0:04:05.560,0:04:13.660
they weren't long, whitish, with a grey stripe;

0:04:13.660,0:04:16.880
a thick grey stripe on each horn.

0:04:16.880,0:04:24.920
He had a long face and arms up till the ellbow.

0:04:24.920,0:04:28.520
Can I show you guys?

0:04:28.520,0:04:32.780
His arms were like this.

0:04:32.780,0:04:34.960
He couldn't move this part.

0:04:34.960,0:04:40.040
He could only move it the way I'm showing you now.

0:04:40.040,0:04:52.800
His hands were very big; they were too big for his body.

0:04:52.800,0:04:55.700
He had big hips.

0:04:55.700,0:04:58.800
The bones - there wasn't even flesh.

0:04:58.800,0:05:05.340
The bones were also white and dry - they were like dry bones; very dry.

0:05:05.340,0:05:11.420
He had very long legs and his feet were very big.

0:05:11.420,0:05:16.320
His hands and nails were very long.

0:05:16.320,0:05:30.780
His hands had wrinkles like on little babies' hands and were white.

0:05:30.780,0:05:32.620
He was just very ugly.

0:05:32.620,0:05:36.980
What were the things that this problem made you to do?

0:05:36.980,0:05:41.860
It was so easy for me to attract men and to seduce them.

0:05:41.860,0:05:45.800
When they passed me, they would look back - I just knew that.

0:05:45.800,0:05:50.960
My marriage was a total disaster.

0:05:50.960,0:05:53.340
I couldn't allow my husband to get near me.

0:05:53.340,0:05:59.500
Even when he touched me, it irritated me a lot.

0:05:59.500,0:06:02.060
I couldn't walk up to my husband to give him a hug

0:06:02.060,0:06:05.720
even though I felt inside that I wanted to hug him.

0:06:05.720,0:06:11.960
The desire was there to hug him but I couldn't get to him to hug him or even kiss him.

0:06:11.960,0:06:16.000
If he touched me, it felt as if I could scream at him and

0:06:16.000,0:06:20.280
say, "Stop it, I don't like it".

0:06:20.280,0:06:22.060
I also have children.

0:06:22.060,0:06:28.300
When they were playing around me - I love my children so much -

0:06:28.300,0:06:35.120
I might just start talking, it irritated me incredibly.

0:06:35.120,0:06:38.160
I would chase them away and tell them, "Just go outside and play

0:06:38.160,0:06:40.720
but not around where I am sitting!"

0:06:40.720,0:06:43.820
When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to pray for me,

0:06:43.820,0:06:48.080
I grabbed hold of my chair because I didn't want to jump up

0:06:48.080,0:06:52.760
but the demon inside of me wanted to attack the prophet.

0:06:52.760,0:06:59.440
At one moment the anger was so much inside of me.

0:06:59.440,0:07:03.280
I knew that if I could get to the prophet

0:07:03.280,0:07:08.360
with the authority I had in me, I could attack him

0:07:08.360,0:07:13.620
but because of the authority he had in Jesus Christ--

0:07:13.620,0:07:18.040
So you mean that during the prayer, you literally wanted to attack the prophet

0:07:18.040,0:07:20.280
because of the demon inside of you.

0:07:20.280,0:07:24.020
But then, you could not because of the authority of Jesus Christ

0:07:24.020,0:07:25.820
when the prophet was praying for you.

0:07:25.820,0:07:27.680
Tell us, how did it feel?

0:07:27.680,0:07:31.000
We saw how you tried many times to stand up. What stopped you?

0:07:31.000,0:07:35.240
What was it that actually stopped you from touching the prophet?

0:07:35.240,0:07:41.420
The authority in his voice that he has in Jesus Christ.

0:07:41.420,0:07:43.600
I couldn't even look at him.

0:07:43.600,0:07:48.840
It is just like you don't have control over your body.

0:07:48.840,0:07:53.880
I looked away; he just started to turn and I looked away.

0:07:53.880,0:07:59.620
I couldn't look at him - it is the presence of God. It is overwhelming.

0:07:59.620,0:08:04.180
Why could you actually not look at Prophet T.B. Joshua while the prayer was going on?

0:08:04.180,0:08:08.280
What did you see that would stop you from looking at Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:08:08.280,0:08:11.360
It was the light of Jesus Christ in him.

0:08:11.360,0:08:19.540
When he told me to sit down, I couldn't resist.

0:08:19.540,0:08:22.780
It is like the Word of God says, "Every knee shall bow".

0:08:22.780,0:08:25.400
That's what happened there.

0:08:25.400,0:08:29.440
I just sat down because of the authority.

0:08:29.440,0:08:36.900
When the prophet prayed for me, there was no more anger inside of me.

0:08:36.900,0:08:40.340
It's a calmness inside of me.

0:08:40.340,0:08:46.440
Before, I was always in a hurry; I was all over the place.

0:08:46.440,0:08:49.920
But after the prayer, there is a calmness inside of me.

0:08:49.920,0:08:55.720
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!

0:08:55.720,0:08:58.980
You mean, immediately after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:08:58.980,0:09:02.700
you felt that the demon left you and you felt a calmness,

0:09:02.700,0:09:05.280
a peace in your heart that you had not experienced before.

0:09:05.280,0:09:05.900
Yes. Thank You, Jesus.

0:09:05.900,0:09:11.180
Oh, that's wonderful! Let's clap for Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!

0:09:11.180,0:09:15.360
Now that Jesus Christ has set you free, tell us about your mind now.

0:09:15.360,0:09:18.420
Are you still having any of those negative thoughts you used to have?

0:09:18.420,0:09:21.320
No, there are no negative thoughts.

0:09:21.320,0:09:22.340
And you are free?

0:09:22.340,0:09:23.020
Yes, I am free!

0:09:23.020,0:09:26.040
Let's put our hands together for the miracle-working Jesus Christ!

0:09:26.040,0:09:29.300
Hallelujah!

0:09:29.300,0:09:34.980
My promise to God is to go and sin no more.

0:09:34.980,0:09:39.100
I would like to give advice to people outside there.

0:09:39.100,0:09:46.260
Please, if you don't have faith in the name of Jesus Christ, don't use it.

0:09:46.260,0:09:50.560
You can cause so much problems for yourself.

0:09:50.560,0:09:53.560
Read your Bible with devotion.

0:09:53.560,0:09:56.280
Don't use the name in vain.

0:09:56.280,0:09:59.700
Amen. That's a wonderful advice to everyone of us here.

0:09:59.700,0:10:01.160
We thank God for your life.

0:10:01.160,0:10:04.700
We thank Jesus that you are set free from this problem forever.

0:10:04.700,0:10:08.760
And we pray that God will give you the grace to continue to go and sin no more

0:10:08.760,0:10:10.580
as you promised, in Jesus' name.

0:10:10.580,0:10:11.820
Amen.

0:10:11.820,0:10:14.380
Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:10:14.380,0:10:20.300
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
