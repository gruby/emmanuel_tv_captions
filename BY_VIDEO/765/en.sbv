I think I need to chip in a word, before we go for healing.

0:00:11.760,0:00:17.880
Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings

0:00:17.980,0:00:26.480
are hindered by the way and manner we go about the issue of money.

0:00:39.200,0:00:40.880
I will repeat again

0:00:43.220,0:00:47.220
Healing, deliverance and all of Gods blessings

0:00:51.600,0:00:53.600
are hindered today,

0:00:57.000,0:01:02.720
by the way and manner we go about the issue of money,money,money.

0:01:15.500,0:01:21.000
No one can give money from his heart before healing.

0:01:29.960,0:01:36.380
No one can give money from his heart before healing.

0:01:42.720,0:01:50.600
Anybody that gives money before healing is giving that money on condition,

0:01:51.420,0:01:53.420
Heal me- have money.

0:02:04.220,0:02:09.480
Healing and Gods blessing should not be exchanged with money.

0:02:16.820,0:02:18.400
When we give freely,

0:02:21.220,0:02:23.060
as we have been given freely

0:02:25.460,0:02:28.660
God will raise his people to bless us-

0:02:32.040,0:02:33.220
abundantly

0:02:34.460,0:02:37.580
Anything that does not come to the heart is a sin

0:02:43.960,0:02:48.020
If someone gives money before healing,

0:02:48.020,0:02:52.500
He has not given it from his heart, he has given it to receive healing.

0:03:02.300,0:03:06.820
And anything that is not from the heart, is a sin.

0:03:11.360,0:03:16.600
This is why it is so difficult to receive healing and deliverance today.

0:03:22.440,0:03:27.720
All these- Gods blessings, are hindered

0:03:29.880,0:03:35.580
by the manner and way we go about money.

0:03:41.040,0:03:42.160
Thank you!

0:03:56.160,0:04:09.040
Whatever you give me now, before prayer, is not from your heart.

0:04:09.800,0:04:23.180
Whatever you give me now, before your healing is not from your heart.

0:04:23.580,0:04:29.740
and anything that is not from the heart is a sin.

0:04:30.660,0:04:39.920
It means, you give me sin, tribulation, sickness -

0:04:41.560,0:04:43.800
You are giving me the affliction.

0:04:45.500,0:04:52.060
(The Spirit of God comes in the scene, as prophet T.B Joshua stretches forth his hand to pray for this lady.

0:04:52.340,0:04:56.660
Remember where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.

0:04:57.100,0:05:02.400
And healing, deliverance and all of God's blessing are just like breathing.)

0:05:03.000,0:05:11.720
I am very very sure, if I had collected money from her, she would not receive.

0:05:21.520,0:05:27.520
She is under the influence of the Holy Ghost

0:05:42.760,0:05:45.120
Rise and walk!

0:05:49.780,0:05:51.460
stand up!

0:05:59.220,0:06:03.240
(What a miracle, After receiving prayers from prophet T.B Joshua,

0:06:03.600,0:06:07.340
this lady begin to vomit out every poisonous substance from her body

0:06:07.640,0:06:10.720
which has been troubling her system for a very long time.)

0:06:11.420,0:06:18.200
(When Jesus comes into our lives he brushes away our past and gives birth to our glorious future)

0:06:18.840,0:06:24.800
(Glory be to God! she waves her hands is appreciation for the mighty miracle she has just received.)
