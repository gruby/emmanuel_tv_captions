Happy New Year!

0:00:09.100,0:00:10.620
Thank you.

0:00:10.620,0:00:16.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:16.840,0:00:19.300
Thank you.

0:00:19.300,0:00:23.560
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:23.560,0:00:28.080
I know - because you see me in what you are wearing everyday.

0:00:28.080,0:00:31.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:31.560,0:00:35.660
Don't worry - next week you will see me wearing 'Agbada' (Nigerian robe).

0:00:35.660,0:00:40.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:40.140,0:00:43.540
Even wearing this I am not comfortable enough.

0:00:43.540,0:00:46.720
I need to get used to it.

0:00:46.720,0:00:49.720
Good morning!

0:00:49.720,0:00:52.300
Wow.

0:00:52.300,0:00:54.940
Happy New Year!

0:00:54.940,0:00:58.080
A New Beginning!

0:00:58.080,0:01:07.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:07.180,0:01:11.340
Viewers, Happy New Year!

0:01:11.340,0:01:13.560
A New Beginning!

0:01:13.560,0:01:17.200
Take it; believe it.

0:01:17.200,0:01:20.500
When you say, "Happy New Year!", you are talking of faith.

0:01:20.500,0:01:24.020
You want to wine and dine with God – faith.

0:01:24.020,0:01:29.440
Only faith pleases Him – no alternative – no shortcut.

0:01:29.440,0:01:35.340
God wants to be involved in our lives as mother's.

0:01:35.340,0:01:42.820
Tell your neighbour, "God wants to be involved in our lives as mother's".

0:01:42.820,0:01:46.700
You know mother - good mother...

0:01:46.700,0:01:51.400
God is concerned about you; He is concerned about us.

0:01:51.400,0:02:00.260
He wants to be involved as a mother in our lives.

0:02:00.260,0:02:05.480
We just have to allow Him by faith.

0:02:05.480,0:02:11.340
Allow Him; that is why He tells us to pray.

0:02:11.340,0:02:17.080
The case now is: prayer is a work of faith.

0:02:17.080,0:02:20.300
You can't just rise and...

0:02:20.300,0:02:25.640
Christians we have today, all over the world, - we have a lot of challenges.

0:02:25.640,0:02:33.980
We can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.

0:02:33.980,0:02:43.160
Tell your neighbour, "You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith".

0:02:43.160,0:02:44.600
Tell your neighbour again.

0:02:44.600,0:02:48.860
(You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.)

0:02:48.860,0:02:50.220
I can't hear you.

0:02:50.220,0:02:53.340
(You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.)

0:02:53.340,0:03:01.260
So, when you see your neighbour... he can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.

0:03:01.260,0:03:03.500
That is the problem.

0:03:03.500,0:03:08.620
That is just the problem - you don't know who is praying.

0:03:08.620,0:03:15.180
You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.

0:03:15.180,0:03:22.020
This is what happens all over the world today - you see people; "fire, prayer in your house..."

0:03:22.020,0:03:27.480
Who is praying?

0:03:27.480,0:03:33.020
When you are a man of prayer and not a man of faith, you are saying words.

0:03:33.020,0:03:35.380
Tell your neighbour.

0:03:35.380,0:03:43.680
You are saying words when you are a man of prayer and not a man of faith.

0:03:43.680,0:03:46.620
You are saying words.

0:03:46.620,0:03:55.140
But when you are a man of prayer and a man of faith, you are praying prayer.

0:03:55.140,0:04:00.160
You can be saying words -

0:04:00.160,0:04:06.020
that is, you are talking to yourself and talking to people around you but not God.

0:04:06.020,0:04:11.880
Saying words is different from praying prayer.

0:04:11.880,0:04:20.160
Millions of prayers are prayed with almost no faith.

0:04:20.160,0:04:29.600
I repeat again: "Millions of prayers are prayed with almost no faith".

0:04:29.600,0:04:36.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:36.580,0:04:39.440
This is what is happening; this is why there is no result.

0:04:39.440,0:04:50.380
This is why people shout - this is about prayers in churches everywhere; but the effect we cannot see.

0:04:50.380,0:05:04.880
Millions of prayers are prayed with almost no faith.

0:05:04.880,0:05:08.320
Overflow Congregation

0:05:08.320,0:05:10.500
So, it is possible...

0:05:10.500,0:05:20.620
So, when you see praying people - be conscious - is it really a man of faith?

0:05:20.620,0:05:28.080
Because you can be a man of prayer and perhaps not a man of faith.

0:05:28.080,0:05:34.920
You can be a woman of prayer and perhaps not a woman of faith.

0:05:34.920,0:05:42.920
When you are a woman of prayer and not a woman of faith, you are saying words -

0:05:42.920,0:05:45.440
that is, you talk.

0:05:45.440,0:05:53.860
You talk to people: people around you will hear you, "she is praying", and you inside will hear yourself, but God...

0:05:53.860,0:06:00.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:00.200,0:06:13.120
Sometimes it is very frustrating to be talking to someone who is not a man of faith.

0:06:13.120,0:06:22.480
This is why we allow testimonies of people...

0:06:22.480,0:06:28.760
The Bible says when you see God as reliable, you put your trust in Him.

0:06:28.760,0:06:32.700
Ha - He is reliable, He can do it for me.

0:06:32.700,0:06:39.760
He has done it for this person, I can see what God had done - that is greater from what I am looking for.

0:06:39.760,0:06:45.160
"He had given a greater blessing to this person but I am looking for a small one - He will do it for me."

0:06:45.160,0:06:51.260
You put your trust in Him.

0:06:51.260,0:07:04.880
If you pay attention to God's Word, you will find that faith comes spontaneously.

0:07:04.880,0:07:12.880
Pay attention with all your heart.

0:07:12.880,0:07:17.500
It is that simple.

0:07:17.500,0:07:29.320
When you look at your Bible, you would agree with me: no faith, no God for you.

0:07:29.320,0:07:32.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:32.080,0:07:38.660
Open your Bible at the Book of Luke 8:25 - hear God's Word.

0:07:38.660,0:07:40.840
WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?

0:07:40.840,0:07:44.200
That is the language.

0:07:44.200,0:07:46.720
Luke 8:25

0:07:46.720,0:07:55.340
He says, "Where is your faith? If I cannot find your faith I cannot talk to you. If I talk to you you cannot receive."

0:07:55.340,0:07:57.960
WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?

0:07:57.960,0:08:03.040
I am here today to ask you: where is your faith?

0:08:03.040,0:08:06.520
Look at Luke 8:25.

0:08:06.520,0:08:10.200
WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?

0:08:10.200,0:08:11.900
Let someone say, "Where is your faith?"

0:08:11.900,0:08:14.020
(Where is your faith?)

0:08:14.020,0:08:16.580
It is like, "Where is your Bible?"

0:08:16.580,0:08:22.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:22.900,0:08:27.860
That is God's Word.

0:08:27.860,0:08:30.400
Where is your faith?

0:08:30.400,0:08:37.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:37.500,0:08:44.360
In Mark 4:40; we hear what God said there.

0:08:44.360,0:08:51.500
He said, "Do you still have no faith?"

0:08:51.500,0:09:01.500
After having met them many times: "Do you still have no faith?"

0:09:01.500,0:09:05.860
It is for you to know the importance of it.

0:09:05.860,0:09:07.840
Do you still have no faith?

0:09:07.840,0:09:09.720
Ask your neighbour.

0:09:09.720,0:09:12.260
(Do you still have no faith?)

0:09:12.260,0:09:16.280
That is the question here.

0:09:16.280,0:09:20.520
In every area.

0:09:20.520,0:09:29.440
When you look at the Book of John 20:27 - it says, "Stop doubting and believe."

0:09:29.440,0:09:38.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:38.040,0:09:51.280
The worst one in the Book of Mark 16:14 - it says, "When He saw their lack of faith, He rebuked them."

0:09:51.280,0:09:53.280
Cast them...

0:09:53.280,0:09:57.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:57.600,0:10:02.040
He said, "Aa, they have no faith" - He rebuked them.

0:10:02.040,0:10:08.420
He knew they were not for Him and they cannot ever be before Him without faith.

0:10:08.420,0:10:12.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:12.940,0:10:15.760
So, therefore...

0:10:15.760,0:10:26.900
When you see people praying, it would be too early for you to say, "He is a child of God, or "A woman of faith",

0:10:26.900,0:10:33.620
because one can be a woman of prayer but perhaps not a woman of faith.

0:10:33.620,0:10:39.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:39.360,0:10:40.780
It is difficult; people don't know.

0:10:40.780,0:10:46.320
People believe that once you pray you pray - no.

0:10:46.320,0:10:50.660
Saying words is different from praying prayer.

0:10:50.660,0:10:54.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:54.180,0:10:59.600
Let us think about it and stop wasting your time.

0:10:59.600,0:11:05.760
You say, "I pray and no answer or result", while you are saying words.

0:11:05.760,0:11:10.900
When you are talking you are saying words and you say you pray.

0:11:10.900,0:11:17.240
Saying words is different from praying prayer.

0:11:17.240,0:11:23.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:23.600,0:11:24.840
You say, "I fast" - the same thing.

0:11:24.840,0:11:32.520
You can be fasting and that is for you and people around you.

0:11:32.520,0:11:35.780
God is a cheerful giver.

0:11:35.780,0:11:41.540
He wants to heal, bless and deliver you because He is so much concerned about you.

0:11:41.540,0:11:42.840
He loves you.

0:11:42.840,0:11:47.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:47.540,0:11:59.760
To reach Him, prayer is the master key and prayer is a work of faith.

0:11:59.760,0:12:08.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:08.840,0:12:20.960
Find time, sit down and meditate over this - that, "I am just a woman of prayer, not a woman of faith.

0:12:20.960,0:12:34.020
I am just saying words, not praying prayer. I am just talking to people and myself. Not to God.

0:12:34.020,0:12:48.360
What a shameful thing; very embarrassing. I thought I was praying to God."

0:12:48.360,0:13:00.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:00.280,0:13:02.800
Now - to have faith...

0:13:02.800,0:13:15.960
If you pay attention, you would find that faith comes spontaneously, that is, naturally.

0:13:15.960,0:13:18.880
Attention - what is attention?

0:13:18.880,0:13:25.740
All your heart, your soul.

0:13:25.740,0:13:35.440
All your heart; you listen to what they are saying.

0:13:35.440,0:13:41.340
Not to hear and monitor your business at the same time, instead of leaving your business for God.

0:13:41.340,0:13:48.320
So, I hear here and my mind is also over there.

0:13:48.320,0:13:51.360
All your heart.

0:13:51.360,0:13:55.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:55.360,0:13:58.400
You have to be very inquisitive.

0:13:58.400,0:14:02.260
Find out the truth and the truth will set you free.

0:14:02.260,0:14:06.400
Don't just take everything you hear.

0:14:06.400,0:14:14.840
Don't just take everything you hear and see; you must examine them in the light of God's Word.

0:14:14.840,0:14:23.880
To examine things in the light of God's Word is to ask, "God, what is this? God, what is that? God tell me more".

0:14:23.880,0:14:26.240
Examine everything.

0:14:26.240,0:14:31.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:31.560,0:14:34.380
We have come a long way.

0:14:34.380,0:14:46.080
You have been to many places – a lot of places of worship.

0:14:46.080,0:14:48.860
You have seen enough.

0:14:48.860,0:14:57.740
Having seen enough is to be able to discern the truth from the false.

0:14:57.740,0:15:03.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:03.120,0:15:04.620
God loves you.

0:15:04.620,0:15:06.400
(Amen.)

0:15:06.400,0:15:11.840
How do you know God loves you?

0:15:11.840,0:15:17.840
When you don't love Him and He loves you, how will you appreciate this?

0:15:17.840,0:15:21.300
You say "Amen."
How, can somebody...?

0:15:21.300,0:15:27.140
Tell me how do you know God loves you?

0:15:27.140,0:15:30.540
Without correspondence.

0:15:30.540,0:15:36.460
If I love you and don't love me, what kind of love is that?

0:15:36.460,0:15:38.040
No correspondence.

0:15:38.040,0:15:41.800
I love you and you don't love me.

0:15:41.800,0:15:46.780
... by your way, action, attitude - you don't love me.

0:15:46.780,0:15:55.140
What kind of love is that?

0:15:55.140,0:16:00.920
If I love you and you don’t respond, what kind of love is that?

0:16:00.920,0:16:03.180
It is not a good love.

0:16:03.180,0:16:09.460
That is the love you have for God.

0:16:09.460,0:16:14.240
We seem to be more of His enemy than His friend.

0:16:14.240,0:16:18.220
More of His enemy than His what?

0:16:18.220,0:16:21.560
His friend.

0:16:21.560,0:16:26.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:26.420,0:16:30.560
Our challenges that are supposed to draw us close to God,

0:16:30.560,0:16:39.480
seem to take us off, take us away from God and that is the purpose of challenges.

0:16:39.480,0:16:47.440
The purpose of challenges is to draw us close.

0:16:47.440,0:16:51.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:51.760,0:16:58.940
Your challenges, whatever you are going through -

0:16:58.940,0:17:09.540
sickness, hardship, setback, just name whatever you are going through -

0:17:09.540,0:17:18.940
are to draw you closer to Him but opposite is the case today.

0:17:18.940,0:17:21.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:21.320,0:17:28.020
How many years are we taking to find out the truth?

0:17:28.020,0:17:31.820
For how long shall we continue finding out the truth?

0:17:31.820,0:17:38.960
Is it God, is it this, is it a challenge, is it devil - for how long?

0:17:38.960,0:17:45.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:45.620,0:17:50.860
What we received last year - where is it?

0:17:50.860,0:17:52.960
What are you asking for?

0:17:52.960,0:18:04.580
What we are asking for today are those things we have received in the past but we lack maintenance.

0:18:04.580,0:18:11.020
God wants to do awesome things but because of lack of dynamic faith,

0:18:11.020,0:18:14.200
those things cannot be done through us.

0:18:14.200,0:18:19.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:19.840,0:18:27.020
Lack of dynamic faith limits what God can do through us.

0:18:27.020,0:18:31.180
Faith is like coins – Heavenly currency.

0:18:31.180,0:18:38.120
How much you have is how much you get.

0:18:38.120,0:18:45.040
When you go to the market with million dollars, you cannot get more than this money in the market.

0:18:45.040,0:18:47.200
What you have is what you get.

0:18:47.200,0:18:54.660
This faith we talk about is Heavenly currency to get Heavenly resources.

0:18:54.660,0:19:03.040
Healing, salvation, blessing, breakthrough; we get them, we buy them.

0:19:03.040,0:19:08.600
You can purchase Heavenly resources with Heavenly currency.

0:19:08.600,0:19:14.900
How much you get is how much you obtain.

0:19:14.900,0:19:18.780
Your faith took you here today.

0:19:18.780,0:19:22.940
Will the same faith also get you what you want here?

0:19:22.940,0:19:26.860
How much will this faith obtain?

0:19:26.860,0:19:27.980
That is it.

Your faith got you here today.

0:19:31.120,0:19:33.680
Look at the analysis I have given you.

0:19:33.680,0:19:38.500
The voice of God - it says, "Where is your faith?"

0:19:38.500,0:19:44.120
That shows, if you don't have faith, He cannot address you.

0:19:44.120,0:19:49.180
Where is your faith?

0:19:49.180,0:19:51.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:51.840,0:19:54.480
Do you still have no faith?

0:19:54.480,0:20:03.160
That is - after much addressing, teaching, messages, going to churches, you are a Christian - yet

0:20:03.160,0:20:06.060
you still have no faith?

0:20:06.060,0:20:07.880
That is the question.

0:20:07.880,0:20:17.000
Stop doubting and believe.

0:20:17.000,0:20:29.160
Because of lack of faith, He rebuked brethren in the Book of Mark 16:14.

0:20:29.160,0:20:32.960
He rebuked them.

0:20:32.960,0:20:41.920
You are a satan, you are a devil - get behind me.

0:20:41.920,0:20:45.500
And I say, "Don't let us waste our time".

0:20:45.500,0:20:51.560
If you know how to pray and you are buying a book which teaches you how to pray...

0:20:51.560,0:21:00.420
You can be a woman of prayer but perhaps not a woman of faith.

0:21:00.420,0:21:03.980
Many of you have books that teach you...

0:21:03.980,0:21:08.860
When you are praying you have your own words.

0:21:08.860,0:21:15.380
You can be a woman of prayer but perhaps not a woman of faith

0:21:15.380,0:21:25.480
and if you pray without faith, you are saying words.

0:21:25.480,0:21:30.800
You can now think of challenges you have been facing.

0:21:30.800,0:21:37.120
Pray pray pray...

0:21:37.120,0:21:48.840
It may be you are saying words and not praying prayer.
