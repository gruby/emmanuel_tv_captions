0:00:00.660,0:00:07.400
It is the will of God for all of us to be set free from satanic bondage for the salvation of our souls.

0:00:07.400,0:00:12.080
As Prophet T.B. Joshua moves in the midst of the people ministering prayer,

0:00:12.080,0:00:15.620
the evil spirits tormenting them manifest violently

0:00:15.620,0:00:21.840
as they are cast out in the name above all names - Jesus Christ!

0:00:21.840,0:00:26.200
Let's watch as satan looses his grip on this man's life.

0:00:26.200,0:00:28.260
I made him kill himself.

0:00:28.260,0:00:30.480
I made him smoke.

0:00:30.480,0:00:32.400
I stole his money.

0:00:32.400,0:00:34.040
I stole his family.

0:00:34.040,0:00:37.140
He is addicted to drugs.

0:00:37.140,0:00:40.640
He is addicted to alcohol.

0:00:40.640,0:00:42.960
Who are you in this body?

0:00:42.960,0:00:45.100
I'm going to make him kill himself.

0:00:45.100,0:00:47.480
Who are you?

0:00:47.480,0:00:49.760
I am death.

0:00:49.760,0:00:54.620
How did you enter him?

0:00:54.620,0:00:57.260
I came in the air.

0:00:57.260,0:01:01.800
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:01.800,0:01:07.000
Emmanuel, people of God!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:07.000,0:01:11.780
My name is Thoriso Maduna.

0:01:11.780,0:01:18.060
I am from Johannesburg, South Africa.

0:01:18.060,0:01:27.960
I came to The SCOAN in search of peace and deliverance,

0:01:27.960,0:01:37.720
to find and meet Jesus Christ and to see the face of God.

0:01:37.720,0:01:45.720
I started doing drugs when I was young.

0:01:45.720,0:01:48.160
Just before you tell us how the story began,

0:01:48.160,0:01:51.440
tell us what the things were that you were actually addicted to,

0:01:51.440,0:01:55.040
that brought you to The SCOAN.

0:01:55.040,0:02:10.280
Alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, women, pornography and a bad reputation.

0:02:10.280,0:02:24.660
I was addicted to hatred - just anything negative that any young man would experience in their life.

0:02:24.660,0:02:36.660
I was addicted to all negativity in a young man's life which only brings death.

0:02:36.660,0:02:39.660
Okay, tell us how it all started.

0:02:39.660,0:02:48.500
It started when I was 13 years old and it started through music.

0:02:48.500,0:02:56.220
The influence of the music that we were listening to at that time led us to...

0:02:56.220,0:02:59.840
When I say us, I mean I and my friends, but to make it more personal:

0:02:59.840,0:03:14.700
It led me to start drinking, smoking marijuana and cigarettes at a very young age.

0:03:14.700,0:03:24.060
It led us to become popular in our community as 'the bad boys'.

0:03:24.060,0:03:33.640
In order to maintain this popularity, one had to increase the rate of smoking and drinking -

0:03:33.640,0:03:45.920
to such a point where I would smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day, I would drink a bottle of rum daily.

0:03:45.920,0:03:58.240
It led us to using hard drugs - we moved on towards using cocaine and cardiamin.

0:03:58.240,0:04:08.280
I was addicted to the fast life of going to clubs from Thursday to Monday.

0:04:08.280,0:04:17.420
There was a club that I used to go to every day of the week without fail.

0:04:17.420,0:04:28.940
The amount of money it cost to maintain this life was honestly not manageable.

0:04:28.940,0:04:37.500
I lost my job, I lost my contracts, I lost everything in my life.

0:04:37.520,0:04:47.180
The only thing that I could say I had was my life.

0:04:47.180,0:04:54.420
I then started with criminal activities in order to maintain this lifestyle -

0:04:54.420,0:05:03.800
in order to maintain the alcohol, women and addiction to drugs.

0:05:03.800,0:05:10.000
Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony

0:05:10.000,0:05:13.440
We can understand exactly what our brother is talking about.

0:05:13.440,0:05:16.960
Right from the age of 13, you had these serious addictions.

0:05:16.960,0:05:23.020
Now we want you to be a little more specific, especially on this issue of drug addiction.

0:05:23.020,0:05:26.780
It is a problem that so many people around the world are facing especially young people.

0:05:26.780,0:05:31.160
Tell us - how did you start getting into this addiction to drugs

0:05:31.160,0:05:34.300
and what happened to your life once you began taking these drugs?

0:05:34.300,0:05:37.620
How serious was this addiction?

0:05:37.620,0:05:41.560
The impact is very painful

0:05:41.560,0:05:50.220
and I am sure that people with the same addiction worldwide will relate to it.

0:05:50.220,0:05:58.020
The impact that it had on my life is that I lost everything.

0:05:58.020,0:06:06.440
I lost my family, I lost myself, I lost God, I lost everything.

0:06:06.440,0:06:15.100
To such a point where these drugs take you over

0:06:15.100,0:06:22.380
and they make you believe that you don't have a problem.

0:06:22.380,0:06:26.520
They make you believe that you are the victim

0:06:26.520,0:06:30.640
when in actual fact, that is not the truth.

0:06:30.640,0:06:35.140
What they do is that they physically damage your brain

0:06:35.140,0:06:44.720
such that an individual cannot make any kind of advantageous decision for himself.

0:06:44.720,0:06:55.720
The impact now is that an individual - like what happened to me - starts to hate himself and the world.

0:06:55.720,0:07:03.620
You come to believe that the world hates you and everybody is against you.

0:07:03.620,0:07:10.840
You find yourself in a victim position.

0:07:10.840,0:07:16.160
The only result that comes from that is death

0:07:16.160,0:07:21.480
because if you don't kill yourself out of depression,

0:07:21.480,0:07:26.200
which comes as an effect of the drugs,

0:07:26.200,0:07:29.860
you intentionally put yourself in a situation

0:07:29.860,0:07:36.560
where you get killed either in a car accident because of intoxication,

0:07:36.560,0:07:44.200
in a fight where guns are being pulled out,

0:07:44.200,0:07:49.420
or through some other means or way.

0:07:49.420,0:07:59.040
What happened to me is that I found myself very close to death.

0:07:59.040,0:08:03.040
The Spirit of the living God throughout my trials at that time

0:08:03.040,0:08:07.760
has always been present, even when I was sinning.

0:08:07.760,0:08:17.040
There was a month I escaped three bad car accidents.

0:08:17.040,0:08:21.100
I was hijacked twice and

0:08:21.100,0:08:31.000
none of the bullets which were shot at me actually hit my body by the grace of God.

0:08:31.000,0:08:41.300
By the time I realised that I was very close to losing my life, I had given up.

0:08:41.300,0:08:47.820
The impact of the drugs on my mind was that I felt I needed protection

0:08:47.820,0:08:53.400
and I made arrangements to get a gun.

0:08:53.400,0:09:04.200
I got myself a gun but I couldn't find any bullets for the gun, by the grace of God.

0:09:04.200,0:09:10.520
I believed that I needed to protect myself, while in the actual fact the spirit was lying to me -

0:09:10.520,0:09:15.220
that gun was for me to kill myself.

0:09:15.220,0:09:17.980
So you are saying, brother, that under the influence of these drugs

0:09:17.980,0:09:23.960
you actually bought a gun and your intention was to take that gun and kill yourself?

0:09:23.960,0:09:27.460
That was the indirect intention.

0:09:27.460,0:09:36.480
The lie which came to me as a result of all these addictions was protection for myself.

0:09:36.480,0:09:42.760
But looking back today, I can confirm without a doubt

0:09:42.760,0:09:47.380
that the purchase of that gun was for suicide.

0:09:47.380,0:09:51.580
We can understand once again the severity of the addiction our brother is talking about.

0:09:51.580,0:09:57.780
Can you explain to us - was it something you were taking on a daily basis?

0:09:57.780,0:10:03.800
To maintain sanity, it had to be on a daily basis.

0:10:03.800,0:10:10.420
A bottle of rum, some drugs and two packets of cigarettes,

0:10:10.420,0:10:16.360
just so that one can stay sane and being normal on a daily basis.

0:10:16.360,0:10:20.900
You said, you began taking cocaine, which is a very hard drug.

0:10:20.900,0:10:25.800
What did that then graduate to after the cocaine? What drug did you then go to?

0:10:25.800,0:10:34.380
Because of the high cost of cocaine, I had to meddle down.

0:10:34.380,0:10:44.060
I then started with cardiamin, which is a cheaper version of cocaine.

0:10:44.060,0:10:54.420
That is one of the most vicious of the drugs which are out there and it is an international epidemic.

0:10:54.420,0:11:03.260
What it does is that it reconfigures your entire thought process mechanism,

0:11:03.260,0:11:09.800
in such a way that it blinds you completely.

0:11:09.800,0:11:15.380
Your brain cannot function under this drug whatsoever.

0:11:15.380,0:11:20.960
It changes your thoughts, it changes how you even look physically -

0:11:20.960,0:11:23.140
only to those who know you.

0:11:23.140,0:11:36.260
This drug can make you believe that the sky is red, even when the sky is blue.

0:11:36.260,0:11:42.540
It takes away the life source that is in you

0:11:42.540,0:11:53.400
such that it causes someone to have that deep hatred - not only for the world but also for himself.

0:11:53.400,0:11:59.540
It is only by the grace of God that one can get out of it.

0:11:59.540,0:12:06.760
I have got so many cases and examples of churches that I went to.

0:12:06.760,0:12:17.760
Before getting to that area, brother, tell us - for how many years were you addicted to these drugs?

0:12:17.760,0:12:25.960
From the time I was 13. I would say for approximately 18 years.

0:12:25.960,0:12:30.980
We can just Imagine what our brother is talking about. For 18 years he had this severe drug addiction.

0:12:30.980,0:12:36.960
You said that it came to a point where to finance this addiction, you had to go into crime.

0:12:36.960,0:12:42.200
Can you just explain what that spirit pushed you into doing to try and get money

0:12:42.200,0:12:47.000
to be able to maintain this addiction.

0:12:47.000,0:12:55.300
Under the control of these drugs, you lose your sense of heart,

0:12:55.300,0:12:57.480
and you would be willing to do anything.

0:12:57.480,0:13:07.640
It led me to partake in a few criminal activities which would augment my financial position

0:13:07.640,0:13:15.240
so that I could continue purchasing alcohol and drugs

0:13:15.240,0:13:23.640
and maintain that lifestyle which honestly leads to death.

0:13:23.640,0:13:32.960
All the good things I tried to do all failed.

0:13:32.960,0:13:46.020
Whether it was employment, business opportunities that could change the face of the country,

0:13:46.020,0:13:49.060
or community activities - they all failed.

0:13:49.060,0:13:57.160
But anything I touched that was bad, I succeeded, I flourished.

0:13:57.160,0:14:06.080
I was very well known and popular for being a 'bad boy'.

0:14:06.080,0:14:18.440
Maintaining that 'bad boy' image and status, you end up in a position where you sell your soul.

0:14:18.440,0:14:22.260
Where people get injured and people have to get hurt,

0:14:22.260,0:14:29.440
just for you to keep up with the spirit of that addiction.

0:14:29.440,0:14:33.700
You mentioned at the beginning that apart from drugs and alcohol,

0:14:33.700,0:14:38.460
this also gave you the spirit of lust, addiction to women and pornography.

0:14:38.460,0:14:41.640
Can you explain more about this as well.

0:14:41.640,0:14:48.780
Intoxication and the love for women go hand in hand.

0:14:48.780,0:14:55.040
It is like coffee and sugar - coffee, sugar and milk.

0:14:55.040,0:15:02.680
Whenever one gets addicted to intoxication of any form,

0:15:02.680,0:15:06.260
it brings on a spirit of lust -

0:15:06.260,0:15:15.040
both to the actual women, to pornography and things like that.

0:15:15.040,0:15:22.520
So I found myself having to go to strip clubs, just to keep up.

0:15:22.520,0:15:31.000
One does not have control of oneself, under any form whatsoever.

0:15:31.000,0:15:35.920
It is as though I was under mind control.

0:15:35.920,0:15:48.480
I didn't want to go to strip clubs but I couldn't help it.

0:15:48.480,0:15:53.520
I had no power, I had no ability to shake it off.

0:15:53.520,0:16:00.820
I had no ability to stand and say, "No, I am not going to do such".

0:16:00.820,0:16:11.000
I was under pure mind control and it was like living in a prison

0:16:11.000,0:16:21.200
where you could still see the light but you couldn't go towards the light.

0:16:21.200,0:16:28.500
You are in bondage, you are in chains and yet you can still see the freedom,

0:16:28.500,0:16:38.220
which is so much more painful than when you are in bondage and can't see what freedom is.

0:16:38.220,0:16:42.320
We can really understand from our brother what this pushed him to do.

0:16:42.320,0:16:46.760
Now brother, can you explain - had you ever before attempted to try and stop

0:16:46.760,0:16:51.620
taking these drugs and alcohol and what happened?

0:16:51.620,0:17:04.460
For many years, over a period of about five years, I have been on a quest

0:17:04.460,0:17:13.500
to get out of this life, to no avail whatsoever.

0:17:13.500,0:17:19.760
I have been to churches all over the country back at home in South Africa -

0:17:19.760,0:17:23.360
all to no avail.

0:17:23.360,0:17:28.280
This spirit was so powerful that when I prayed,

0:17:28.280,0:17:34.440
I would hear at the back of my mind something laughing at me.

0:17:34.440,0:17:43.120
Whenever pastors came and laid their hands on me, I would hear the spirit rebuking them.

0:17:43.120,0:17:50.800
It was so difficult to find deliverance especially back at home in South Africa

0:17:50.800,0:17:58.940
because it is given that deliverance comes at a price,

0:17:58.940,0:18:03.340
deliverance comes at a cost.

0:18:03.340,0:18:09.400
To give a practical example:

0:18:09.400,0:18:21.500
I would go to some churches and when it was offering time and I didn't have money at that point,

0:18:21.500,0:18:29.400
I couldn't really shout "Amen" as loud as I would like to shout "Amen".

0:18:29.400,0:18:36.320
But when I did have a lot of money, I would give a sizeable offering

0:18:36.320,0:18:44.260
and I would then feel confident enough to shout "Amen".

0:18:44.260,0:18:50.980
It made me to believe that deliverance comes at a cost.

0:18:50.980,0:19:04.520
Without actally awarding the pastor with a sizable offering or tithe, deliverance would not be possible.

0:19:04.520,0:19:09.740
Every single time I prayed and asked God for deliverance,

0:19:09.740,0:19:18.660
it wasn't a pure prayer because the prayer was based on money.

0:19:18.660,0:19:29.240
What I found here at The SCOAN was the freedom that comes with deliverance,

0:19:29.240,0:19:38.500
the peace that comes with deliverance and the ability to stand and have a clear and open mind,

0:19:38.500,0:19:51.400
to know myself and know that Christ is real, Jesus is real, He lives, He exists.

0:19:51.400,0:19:54.840
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:19:54.840,0:19:59.760
Brother, we still want you to come back to that point of your experience when you came here

0:19:59.760,0:20:03.580
but just before then, we want you to be a little bit more specific.

0:20:03.580,0:20:09.260
When you mentioned that some of the criminal activities you went into to try and fuel this drug addiction

0:20:09.260,0:20:13.460
by getting money. Just give an example of some of them that this spirit pushed you into

0:20:13.460,0:20:17.520
as an opportunity for other people to learn.

0:20:17.520,0:20:26.580
I engaged in quite a lot of fraudulent activities.

0:20:26.580,0:20:32.480
I am a relatively well connected individual back home.

0:20:32.480,0:20:40.180
We could foster some fraudulent activities,

0:20:40.180,0:20:50.880
which really gave us a lot of money like bank card schemes,

0:20:50.880,0:20:55.280
governmental contract schemes and so forth.

0:20:55.280,0:21:06.520
Car hijacking as well to which, funny enough, I also became a victim of.

0:21:06.520,0:21:15.460
It would provide quite a lot of money to an extent of about 30,000-40,000 rand a day.

0:21:15.460,0:21:19.580
But you wasted all that money on drugs?

0:21:19.580,0:21:30.820
Entertainment, intoxication, addiction, women and maintaining a bad reputation.

0:21:30.820,0:21:35.860
You talked about how you have been to so many places seeking for deliverance.

0:21:35.860,0:21:42.040
How did you actually come to hear about The SCOAN?

0:21:42.040,0:21:49.960
A relative of mine had come here a few years ago

0:21:49.960,0:21:59.340
in order to find deliverance for my brother who had cancer.

0:21:59.340,0:22:06.960
Unfortunately, my brother was in such a bad state that he couldn't come to The SCOAN.

0:22:06.960,0:22:17.140
A family representative had to come and she also got delivered upon coming here.

0:22:17.140,0:22:21.980
When she went back home, my brother was healed from cancer.

0:22:21.980,0:22:23.720
He was lying in bed...

Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony

0:22:28.360,0:22:38.780
He was lying in bed and the doctors had told us there was no more hope.

0:22:38.780,0:22:42.640
The hospice had also told us that there was no more hope.

0:22:42.640,0:22:48.360
All they did was that they gave him tablets for him to die in peace.

0:22:48.360,0:22:57.140
By God's grace, in a week he was up and he was even driving my car.

0:22:57.140,0:23:01.440
That was after a family member came to the SCOAN and

0:23:01.440,0:23:03.940
returned and ministered the Morning Water to your brother?

0:23:03.940,0:23:07.280
Yes! That is correct.

0:23:07.280,0:23:19.500
If I remember correctly, she didn't even have to minister to him, her presence healed him,

0:23:19.500,0:23:26.700
when she came directly from The SCOAN.

0:23:26.700,0:23:40.140
Unfortunately at that time, I wasn't seeing myself as one to go to church.

0:23:40.140,0:23:44.620
You know bad boys don't go to church.

0:23:44.620,0:23:53.660
We don't do those kind of things. Cool guys remain in the bars,

0:23:53.660,0:23:59.700
cool guys remain with women. We don't go to church.

0:23:59.700,0:24:04.780
At that time, I was just grateful for my brother's life.

0:24:04.780,0:24:11.220
I was not bothered about how it came about. I did not care at all.

0:24:11.220,0:24:22.460
A few months ago, my dad reminded me of the miracle that happened to my brother.

0:24:22.460,0:24:33.900
He said to me, "Thoriso Maduna, I think you should go and visit The SCOAN".

0:24:33.900,0:24:40.500
God bless him for his wisdom because he knew how to talk.

0:24:40.500,0:24:47.600
Because if he had said to me that I have to go to The SCOAN, I wouldn't have come.

0:24:47.600,0:24:55.260
What he did is that he gave me a suggestion that maybe it could help me.

0:24:55.260,0:25:01.100
I thought to myself that all I was looking for was a solution,

0:25:01.100,0:25:12.260
I was looking for a way out because I had found out that there was a terrible spirit

0:25:12.260,0:25:18.200
behind everything I was doing and I was a mess.

0:25:18.200,0:25:25.240
When I came here to The SCOAN, I came with no expectation.

0:25:25.240,0:25:29.160
I came with no anticipation.

0:25:29.160,0:25:38.100
The only thing which I was looking for was answers and deliverance.

0:25:38.100,0:25:42.100
How it came about, I didn't mind.

0:25:42.100,0:25:50.940
From whom it came, how or what it really was, was not much of my concern.

0:25:50.940,0:25:56.280
All I was looking for was deliverance.

0:25:56.280,0:26:04.860
To my amazement, that deliverance came for free!

0:26:04.860,0:26:12.280
Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony

0:26:12.280,0:26:18.120
At the back of my mind, somehow I was thinking to myself

0:26:18.120,0:26:28.340
that since now I am about to get delivered, I need to start putting money aside

0:26:28.340,0:26:32.020
because I had thought that deliverance doesn't come for free.

0:26:32.020,0:26:44.840
There is no high-rated man of God that I have met ... there must be money involved.

0:26:44.840,0:26:51.320
Just to show that the Holy Spirit is present here.

0:26:51.320,0:26:56.640
It came for free and it came in such a way which I did not expect.

0:26:56.640,0:27:03.980
I thank the Holy Spirit for allowing me to be able to receive deliverance.

0:27:03.980,0:27:11.000
For all the people who came from far and wide,

0:27:11.000,0:27:15.940
I know how it is like to look for a solution

0:27:15.940,0:27:21.920
such that you move all the way from your own country to come here

0:27:21.920,0:27:26.720
and believe me, it has been the best decision of my life.

0:27:26.720,0:27:29.900
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:27:29.900,0:27:33.660
We want you to explain to us exactly what happened in the service last week.

0:27:33.660,0:27:35.060
You were just sitting down,

0:27:35.060,0:27:39.380
Prophet T.B. Joshua began moving in the midst of the people, and he came towards you.

0:27:39.380,0:27:42.480
Just describe to us what happened at that moment.

0:27:42.480,0:27:50.200
It was the most interesting experience.

0:27:50.200,0:27:55.540
I didn't know exactly what to expect. I can see myself over there.

0:27:55.540,0:28:03.180
I didn't know what to expect.

0:28:03.180,0:28:06.380
What happened was that,

0:28:06.380,0:28:12.920
as the man of God was laying hands on the people - I was seated in the back row -

0:28:12.920,0:28:15.840
as the man of God was approaching,

0:28:15.840,0:28:30.920
my spiritual eye opened and I saw myself getting ready for a fight.

0:28:30.920,0:28:34.860
Yet, I could see the man of God coming closer.

0:28:34.860,0:28:42.660
The closer the man of God came, the more I got ready for the fight.

0:28:42.660,0:28:56.560
Immediately he came and put his hand on me, I felt as though I was hit by a big hammer.

0:28:56.560,0:29:06.060
I felt no pain at all but that hammer hit me light out!

0:29:06.060,0:29:16.620
I don't know what happened, I have no idea or recollection of what is on the TV screen.

0:29:16.620,0:29:20.060
I don't know what happened.

0:29:20.060,0:29:32.940
I mean if I were to look, I wouldn't confirm that was me, I would deny it.

0:29:32.940,0:29:42.580
By the time I got up, I felt as though I just woke up from a deep slumber.

0:29:42.580,0:29:50.560
I felt alive, I felt as though I had been sleeping for a long time,

0:29:50.560,0:29:55.180
I woke up from a deep sleep.

0:29:55.180,0:29:59.000
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:29:59.000,0:30:04.160
Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony

0:30:04.160,0:30:10.160
I wasn't conscious of anything that was happening around me.

0:30:10.160,0:30:16.340
I literally woke up from a deep sleep,

0:30:16.340,0:30:25.240
I saw the camera here, the light was on my face,

0:30:25.240,0:30:31.940
the evangelists were preaching and there was a lot of noise.

0:30:31.940,0:30:35.720
I was looking around and thinking to myself, "What is going on?

0:30:35.720,0:30:40.020
Where am I? How did I get here?"

0:30:40.020,0:30:46.920
And for the first time I could think clearly.

0:30:46.920,0:30:55.200
For the first time after a long time, I could hear myself reason and say,

0:30:55.200,0:31:02.840
"I am in The SCOAN and this is my deliverance, and this is me speaking".

0:31:02.840,0:31:03.900
Wow!

0:31:03.900,0:31:08.060
Just tell us, brother, ever since that deliverance last week,

0:31:08.060,0:31:10.680
it has been one week now - what has happened to your life?

0:31:10.680,0:31:15.220
Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony

0:31:15.220,0:31:23.700
I am not even going to talk about any cravings because there is no craving which exists.

0:31:23.700,0:31:30.240
Right now, it is an element which does not exist in my life.

0:31:30.240,0:31:36.120
It is as though it never existed in the past.

0:31:36.120,0:31:46.140
The cravings are no more, I don't know even know how it is like to crave anymore -

0:31:46.140,0:31:56.040
for drugs, alcohol, pornographic images, women, whatsoever.

0:31:56.040,0:31:59.520
I am free, in the name of Jesus!

0:31:59.520,0:32:03.980
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:32:03.980,0:32:08.440
You mean to say, brother, up to the point of your coming to The SCOAN

0:32:08.440,0:32:13.560
last week, you were still taking the drugs, alcohol, cigarettes?

0:32:13.560,0:32:16.540
It was only after your deliverance that you have stopped?

0:32:16.540,0:32:21.520
Yes! That is correct.

0:32:21.520,0:32:32.160
Even before I came, I somehow knew that it was the end.

0:32:32.160,0:32:45.240
I thought to myself, "Let me go out because it is going to be my last time".

0:32:45.240,0:32:55.340
But I found myself not having such a deep desire.

0:32:55.340,0:33:00.240
In fact, because I knew I was coming to The SCOAN,

0:33:00.240,0:33:07.460
I found myself wanting to read the Word more, so that I could understand a bit more where I am going.

0:33:07.460,0:33:12.160
Now, as you are standing here, it has been one week now.

0:33:12.160,0:33:16.000
You said before that this addiction literally controlled your life,

0:33:16.000,0:33:18.680
controlled your thinking, your reasoning faculties,

0:33:18.680,0:33:21.900
imprisoned you and blinded you from reality.

0:33:21.900,0:33:26.200
How are you reasoning, calculating and thinking right now?

0:33:26.200,0:33:30.780
I consider myself a super human.

0:33:30.780,0:33:40.100
My reasoning capacity has returned, I can think clearly, I can see clearly.

0:33:40.100,0:33:49.820
It's beautiful! It's beautiful for me to be myself again.

0:33:49.820,0:33:53.860
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:33:53.860,0:33:58.020
We know you are in a position to really give advice to people around the world,

0:33:58.020,0:34:02.000
especially those under the bondage of this kind of addiction.

0:34:02.000,0:34:05.000
We know around the world, it is such a serious problem -

0:34:05.000,0:34:09.140
people addicted to taking drugs, alcohol, smoking.

0:34:09.140,0:34:11.520
As someone that has passed through this addiction,

0:34:11.520,0:34:14.520
right now you are free from it and you are a living testimony.

0:34:14.520,0:34:17.080
What is your advice to people around the world,

0:34:17.080,0:34:21.620
especially young people who are still into this kind of addiction?

0:34:21.620,0:34:30.180
My advice is: I can understand and I know that you all want to be free.

0:34:30.180,0:34:33.660
The only way to get free is to know Jesus Christ.

0:34:33.660,0:34:42.700
There are no other means, there is no other way.

0:34:42.700,0:34:52.300
Pray hard and believe and find your genuine willingness to get deliverance

0:34:52.300,0:34:59.580
because the spirits of addiction and depression can only be taken away through deliverance.

0:34:59.580,0:35:04.740
There is no other way, there is no other mechanism that can assist.

0:35:04.740,0:35:11.120
My advice to everybody out there that is suffering from any kind of depression or addiction,

0:35:11.120,0:35:17.420
is to pray hard and have a genuine willingness to be delivered

0:35:17.420,0:35:19.760
and God will find you.

0:35:19.760,0:35:23.020
{Amen. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:35:23.020,0:35:27.420
Finally, we know that there are many people who look at the lifestyle of people that are addicted,

0:35:27.420,0:35:29.980
maybe they envy them or are jealous of them,

0:35:29.980,0:35:32.800
they look at them and think they are living a high life, a good life.

0:35:32.800,0:35:36.400
As someone that was into such lifestyle and was part and parcel of that addiction

0:35:36.400,0:35:40.460
what would you like to tell such people?

0:35:40.460,0:35:42.740
I would like to tell those people:

0:35:42.740,0:35:47.560
Firstly, those who are into such a lifestyle - 'the bad boys' of the world -

0:35:47.560,0:35:51.500
I feel your pain, I know your pain, it is painful.

0:35:51.500,0:35:54.700
Get out of it, it is not worth it!

0:35:54.700,0:35:59.960
There is only death - that lifestyle will lead to your death.

0:35:59.960,0:36:06.880
There are only two ways where your life is positioned: It is either in Christ or in the grave.

0:36:06.880,0:36:11.240
All of us want to live - move towards Christ!

0:36:11.240,0:36:13.760
Move towards the Holy Spirit

0:36:13.760,0:36:17.640
and get out of that lifestyle as soon as you can.

0:36:17.640,0:36:23.800
Believe that you can do it, have a genuine willingness to find God and to be delivered

0:36:23.800,0:36:26.080
and God will find you.

0:36:26.080,0:36:38.060
To those who envy the guys who are popular and everything, pray for them!

0:36:38.060,0:36:41.160
That's all I can say - they need your prayers!

0:36:41.160,0:36:50.520
Instead of envying them, pray for them because it is a very painful place to be in.

0:36:50.520,0:36:53.300
Amen. Let's all put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:36:53.300,0:36:56.840
We know the evidence of Jesus is lives changed

0:36:56.840,0:36:59.460
and we thank God for the transformation in our brother's life.

0:36:59.460,0:37:02.680
We believe his testimony will inspire many people around the world

0:37:02.680,0:37:04.820
to also seek deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ

0:37:04.820,0:37:07.780
and we believe we have learned many valuable lessons from his testimony.

0:37:07.780,0:37:10.600
We know that as you make the Word of God the standard for your life,

0:37:10.600,0:37:13.400
the best is yet to come in Jesus' name!

0:37:13.400,0:37:13.900
