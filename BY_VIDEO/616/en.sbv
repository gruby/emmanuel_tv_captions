0:00:00.000,0:00:02.200
Good morning Church !

0:00:02.200,0:00:03.580
Good morning !

0:00:03.580,0:00:05.080
You may be seated, thank you Lord !

0:00:05.080,0:00:06.640
Hallelujeh !

0:00:07.960,0:00:12.920
My time does not work; God's time works.

0:00:12.920,0:00:13.980
Tell your neighbor !

0:00:14.260,0:00:16.580
My time does not work; God's time works.

0:00:17.220,0:00:19.440
When the case is very tight, you begin to speak to yourself

0:00:19.640,0:00:22.080
I don't know... where is ...

0:00:24.660,0:00:26.240
I am sorry !

0:00:34.180,0:00:38.220
Your time does not work; God's time does.

0:00:38.220,0:00:39.100
Hallelujeh !

0:00:40.340,0:00:41.840
The book of Roman 10

0:00:44.620,0:00:45.440
verse 1

0:00:49.140,0:01:00.000
Romans 10:1 "Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved."

0:01:00.360,0:01:02.820
That is prayer for Israelites.

0:01:04.280,0:01:19.340
Romans 10:2 "For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on Knowledge."

0:01:19.340,0:01:21.340
That is on knowledge of truth.

0:01:21.340,0:01:30.460
Romans 10:3 "Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own,"

0:01:30.460,0:01:35.200
Romans 10:3 "they did not submit to God's righteousness."

0:01:35.200,0:01:57.440
As a Christian, with the heart, man testifies, man knows that Jesus is righteousness.

0:01:57.440,0:02:01.080
We are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

0:02:02.460,0:02:04.460
Let's go to the proof text

0:02:04.460,0:02:05.740
verse 9

0:02:05.740,0:02:10.200
Romans 10:9 "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,'

0:02:10.240,0:02:18.900
and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,

0:02:18.900,0:02:21.280
you will be saved."

0:02:21.280,0:02:27.380
With the heart, we know Christ is righteousness.

0:02:27.380,0:02:30.380
But on their own, they have not yet declared

0:02:32.900,0:02:37.220
in their heart, that God raised Jesus from the dead.

0:02:37.220,0:02:38.520
They are not yet !

0:02:40.960,0:02:43.160
Belief in the heart

0:02:43.160,0:02:46.400
Say to yourself, belief in the heart

0:02:47.040,0:02:49.620
As the Bible states it, belief in my heart.

0:02:50.600,0:02:52.600
Belief in your heart.

0:02:53.420,0:02:56.620
Belief in their heart.

0:02:57.140,0:03:03.820
Just as there is a faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ for salvation.

0:03:03.820,0:03:11.900
There is a faith towards the Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost for power,

0:03:11.900,0:03:13.400
Tell your neighbor !

0:03:13.400,0:03:23.900
Just as there is a faith towards our Lord Jesus for salvation.

0:03:23.900,0:03:31.160
There is a faith towards the Holy Ghost for power.

0:03:31.160,0:03:33.940
We are talking about the belief in their heart.

0:03:33.940,0:03:36.460
Belief in your heart, belief in my heart.

0:03:38.120,0:03:40.940
Anyway you see we talk about heart, man's heart !

0:03:40.940,0:03:43.860
Man's spirit, man's heart. Man's spirit, man's heart.

0:03:43.860,0:03:52.300
The more you meditate about what you read in the Bible,

0:03:52.300,0:03:59.900
the more your spirit, that is your heart, acts upon the Word you read.

0:04:06.220,0:04:12.820
In a literal way, the word, 'meditate' means 'think' -

0:04:12.820,0:04:19.000
How can you get the Word into our heart, into our spirit ?

0:04:19.000,0:04:29.020
You get the Word into your spirit when you read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.

0:04:30.540,0:04:32.640
It's not the kind you reading in school.

0:04:32.640,0:04:35.260
You know when you are reading for your academic.

0:04:35.260,0:04:37.740
You have to read and you have to read fast.

0:04:37.780,0:04:39.780
So fast, you understand what you're reading ? No. That's not...

0:04:39.780,0:04:44.000
You must be carried along by the Holy Spirit when you are reading the Bible.

0:04:44.000,0:04:48.580
That is why you have to wait for the Holy Spirit.

0:04:48.580,0:04:53.340
Tell your neighbor: Wait for the Holy Spirit.

0:04:53.340,0:04:54.320
I can't heat you.

0:04:54.320,0:04:57.180
Wait for the Holy Spirit !

0:04:57.180,0:04:58.040
I can't heat you.

0:04:58.080,0:05:00.080
Wait for the Holy Spirit !

0:05:00.080,0:05:07.720
Read slowly, attentively and repeatedly.

0:05:07.720,0:05:12.020
You know while you are reading, you just read, because you understand what you are reading.

0:05:13.520,0:05:17.640
That understanding is mental action.

0:05:18.580,0:05:21.680
Intellectual agreement.

0:05:24.280,0:05:26.280
Intellectual creation.

0:05:36.380,0:05:41.000
To take the word into our heart, into our spirit,

0:05:41.000,0:05:52.420
you must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.

0:05:52.420,0:05:56.440
When you read something slowly, it means you give all your attention.

0:05:56.440,0:06:02.100
If there are many things to think about, you can't read slowly.

0:06:02.100,0:06:10.200
You can't even meditate if there are things around to overwhelm you.

0:06:10.200,0:06:18.300
So, It means to read slowly is to stay focused.

0:06:18.300,0:06:23.980
'Attentively' means off, on the outside, on, on the inside.

0:06:23.980,0:06:25.840
That is attentively.

0:06:25.840,0:06:27.500
'Attentively' means off, on the outside, on, on the inside.

0:06:27.500,0:06:35.820
'Repeatedly' means you have to go back again, trying to figure out the message that is personal.

0:06:35.820,0:06:43.020
and insert your name where the message is personal.

0:06:43.020,0:06:46.580
That is repeatedly - you have to go back again.

0:06:46.580,0:06:49.220
I know you don't understand what you have read.

0:06:49.220,0:06:53.080
But you just have to understand it in God's way.

0:06:53.080,0:06:55.620
In the Holy Spirit way, you have to go back again..(to Bible text)

0:06:55.620,0:07:00.840
and look at those message that are personal, you can insert your name.

0:07:02.260,0:07:05.160
We are talking to ourself as if we are Sunday school children.

0:07:05.180,0:07:08.180
If you know your level in the spirit, you would know you a baby.

0:07:10.520,0:07:14.300
When it comes to the things of the spirit, you are a graduate.

0:07:14.300,0:07:16.760
You are in... just a kindergarten

0:07:18.040,0:07:21.880
You are just learning A, B, C....

0:07:21.980,0:07:24.320
We have to go back again, because you soon forget.

0:07:25.000,0:07:26.900
That's the thing of the spirit.

0:07:26.900,0:07:28.900
Let us say: A, B, C

0:07:29.040,0:07:31.040
A, B, C

0:07:31.040,0:07:32.540
Say it again, you have forgotten

0:07:32.540,0:07:34.460
A, B, C

0:07:34.460,0:07:36.080
That's the thing of the spirit.

0:07:38.640,0:07:40.640
This is way we have to go back again.

0:07:40.640,0:07:43.880
We need to come back to this issue of faith.

0:07:43.880,0:07:51.200
becase many of us are doing foolish things and call it faith.

0:07:52.680,0:07:55.260
We are doing foolish things and call it what ?

0:07:55.260,0:07:56.520
Faith

0:07:56.820,0:07:58.400
Good example

0:07:58.860,0:08:00.580
You tried to imitate me

0:08:00.920,0:08:06.500
Because I brougt a car, after minister the morning water 3 times,

0:08:06.880,0:08:08.880
Immediately you listen to that,

0:08:09.300,0:08:12.680
you tell (ask) your neighbor around you, where is that morning water ?

0:08:13.840,0:08:15.440
They say is the opposite
