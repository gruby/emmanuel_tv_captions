0:00:00.000,0:00:02.820
Hallelujah!

0:00:02.820,0:00:05.680
It is all about faith.

0:00:05.680,0:00:23.360
When we examine our daily life, we will find out how much faith we have.

0:00:23.360,0:00:37.860
When you examine your life, your daily life, you will be able to find out how much faith you have.

0:00:37.860,0:00:41.600
When somebody says, "I'm a Christian" I just laugh.

0:00:41.600,0:00:50.300
I am a Christian, I am a pastor, I am a bishop, I am this... but examine your daily life,

0:00:50.300,0:00:56.880
you will find out how much faith you have.

0:00:56.880,0:01:03.720
An empty profession of faith will not help us at all.

0:01:03.720,0:01:06.700
An empty one...

0:01:06.700,0:01:11.260
This is a life we live today, professional faith - empty.

0:01:11.260,0:01:14.600
I am a Christian, whereas you are not.

0:01:14.600,0:01:16.740
What can we show?

0:01:16.740,0:01:22.460
I am a Christian - this is an empty professional faith.

0:01:22.460,0:01:30.800
Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily life.

0:01:30.800,0:01:44.660
This means, by faith...

0:01:44.660,0:01:52.520
Because we have no other life as a Christian – faith.

0:01:52.520,0:01:59.900
You only apply faith when you need healing – that kind of faith is the kind of Christian you are.

0:01:59.900,0:02:03.780
You apply faith when you are in need of something from God.

0:02:03.780,0:02:06.400
God, help me, I have faith.

0:02:06.400,0:02:10.720
Even to sit down, you need faith to sit down.

0:02:10.720,0:02:14.600
To stand up - by faith.

0:02:14.600,0:02:17.120
To say Amen - by faith.

0:02:17.120,0:02:19.220
To greet - by faith.

0:02:19.220,0:02:28.240
Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily life.

0:02:28.240,0:02:35.600
Until you know how much you need God.

0:02:35.600,0:02:38.140
But you - you don't need God to sit down.

0:02:38.140,0:02:39.700
This is a big mistake.

0:02:39.700,0:02:42.980
You don't know how much you need God, and you claim you are a Christian.

0:02:42.980,0:02:49.140
How many of you actually sit in the name of Jesus, by the help of Jesus,

0:02:49.140,0:02:51.820
or, when you are standing up you say, thank you Jesus?

0:02:51.820,0:02:55.960
No, you don't need God for those things. You believe you can do them.

0:02:55.960,0:03:01.220
Tell your neighbour, “until you begin to know how much you need God.”

0:03:01.220,0:03:04.920
I cannot hear you.

0:03:04.920,0:03:07.420
Do you know that you need God to dress up?

0:03:07.420,0:03:09.520
Even to make a make-up.

0:03:09.520,0:03:13.020
You need God to comb your hair.

0:03:13.020,0:03:16.700
How many of you know this?

0:03:16.700,0:03:18.800
Do you know that you even need God to greet?

0:03:18.800,0:03:24.080
"How are you sir?" - you need God to say that.

0:03:24.080,0:03:28.060
Look at me - I need God to turn around.

0:03:28.060,0:03:30.880
I just need God to pick something from the ground.

0:03:30.880,0:03:32.300
But how many of you know this?

0:03:32.300,0:03:36.280
And you are saying you are serving God.

0:03:36.280,0:03:39.800
You say that you are serving God.

0:03:39.800,0:03:44.720
Satan lashes at you in the area you believe you don’t need God.

0:03:44.720,0:03:48.480
That is where satan attacks you.

0:03:48.480,0:03:51.480
Satan always attacks you where you believe you don't need God.

0:03:51.480,0:03:57.380
When you want to sit down, satan attacks you because he knows you would not call God to help you to sit.

0:03:57.380,0:04:01.380
When God is not involved your strength is zero.

0:04:01.380,0:04:06.680
Tell your neighbour, “satan attacks where we believe we don’t need God”.

0:04:06.680,0:04:10.000
"How are you?" - you believe you don't need God to say that.

0:04:10.000,0:04:11.980
Satan comes in.

0:04:11.980,0:04:18.780
He always monitors your life to study and know the area you do not involve God.

0:04:18.780,0:04:24.900
That is the area to which he will come and attack.

0:04:24.900,0:04:28.860
You want to pray... OK, I'm going to pray, wait for me...

0:04:28.860,0:04:34.540
While you are going you don't need God, until you get to where you want to pray,

0:04:34.540,0:04:40.320
but before that - satan strikes you.

0:04:40.320,0:04:45.200
Until you know how much you need God, then you serve God.

0:04:45.200,0:04:48.120
You don’t know how much you need God.

0:04:48.120,0:04:52.520
You think that you don't need God for small things and you need God for big things.

0:04:52.520,0:04:58.420
You need God when a doctor tells you, "go and write your will,

0:04:58.420,0:05:06.140
we can no longer treat you. Just eat and leave, but this case - nothing we can do."

0:05:06.140,0:05:07.720
Then you run to God.

0:05:07.720,0:05:15.660
But as long as the doctor tells you that they can handle your case - you don't need God.

0:05:15.660,0:05:20.280
You always come to God with a case where all hopes are lost.

0:05:20.280,0:05:21.940
Then you involve God.

0:05:21.940,0:05:23.440
You don't need God.

0:05:23.440,0:05:35.960
Until you know how much you need God, then you begin to live a wonderful life - a life of contentment.

0:05:35.960,0:05:42.120
Then you discover yourself – what God says you can do,

0:05:42.120,0:05:47.380
what God says you are and what God says you can achieve.

0:05:47.380,0:05:50.680
Do you know that you need God to look at me?

0:05:50.680,0:05:55.340
But you are looking at me without involving God.

0:05:55.340,0:06:00.080
My God, you are looking at me without involving God because you don't need God to look at me,

0:06:00.080,0:06:01.460
until you get blind.

0:06:01.460,0:06:06.220
When you get blind you say, "God, open my eyes to see this man".

0:06:06.220,0:06:08.020
Are you with me?

0:06:08.020,0:06:11.640
See, you are looking at me. You don't involve God to see me,

0:06:11.640,0:06:14.080
because you believe you don't need God to see me.

0:06:14.080,0:06:20.200
But when you are blind you involve God to open your eyes to see me.

0:06:20.200,0:06:28.320
Tell your neighbour, "until you know how much you need God".

0:06:28.320,0:06:50.600
Not mine not mine the choice

0:06:50.600,0:07:21.300
In things both great and small

0:07:21.300,0:07:36.840
Be Thou my Guide my Strength
My Wisdom my All

0:07:36.840,0:07:41.300
You may be seated.

0:07:41.300,0:07:47.020
Before your coming here today, your problems are above your strength.

0:07:47.020,0:07:52.820
You realize that you need to go to the Synagogue.

0:07:52.820,0:07:55.240
You were handling things yourself.

0:07:55.240,0:08:00.300
You thought that this thing could have been handled by you with no problem,

0:08:00.300,0:08:03.460
but it is above you, and you quickly have to run here.

0:08:03.460,0:08:05.900
You are welcome.

0:08:05.900,0:08:09.860
Until you know how much you need God.

0:08:09.860,0:08:20.240
I know how much I need God; that is why I pray all the time, 24/7.

0:08:20.240,0:08:23.100
I am always in an attitude of prayer.

0:08:23.100,0:08:27.680
Look at me, I'm calling God to help me to turn.

0:08:27.680,0:08:32.520
See, as I'm talking to you I'm talking to God to help me to turn.

0:08:32.520,0:08:34.940
I turn and I say "Thank you Jesus".

0:08:34.940,0:08:39.240
I need God to move my leg - "Oh God, thank you".

0:08:39.240,0:08:41.640
This is why I pray all the time.

0:08:41.640,0:08:50.000
Because you don’t know how much you need God, that is why you have a time, when and how to pray.

0:08:50.000,0:08:58.360
Big situations happen occasionally but little situations happen all the time.

0:08:58.360,0:09:03.040
Look at me, because I have not called God to be involved - I cannot move.

0:09:03.040,0:09:06.960
OK, now - "God, thank you - I am moving".

0:09:06.960,0:09:12.300
See, at the same time I am talking I pray "thank you for Your strength to talk".

0:09:12.300,0:09:15.680
I am turning again and I pray "thank you Lord, give me the strength to turn".

0:09:15.680,0:09:17.960
If I want to sleep I would do the same.

0:09:17.960,0:09:25.240
All the time - I pray all the time, because I need Him in all I do.

0:09:25.240,0:09:27.440
I know how much I need Him.

0:09:27.440,0:09:31.400
I need Him to be involved in everything I do.

0:09:31.400,0:09:37.820
Then - there is no time to break.

0:09:37.820,0:09:45.420
Your problem is you don't know how much you need God.

0:09:45.420,0:09:51.340
Those areas you believe you don’t need God are the areas the satan uses to enter.

0:09:51.340,0:09:56.940
That is avenue for satan, the route for satan – those areas you believe you don’t need God.

0:09:56.940,0:10:02.180
You create an avenue and opportunity for satan to enter you.

0:10:02.180,0:10:05.800
At the time you think you don't need God - satan has entered already.

0:10:05.800,0:10:13.100
He has used these small things you believed you could do yourself, whereas you don't have any strength.

0:10:13.100,0:10:20.800
Those things you believe you can do yourself, it is not you – you don't have strength to do anything.

0:10:20.800,0:10:24.180
Tell your neighbour, "How much you need God".

0:10:24.180,0:10:28.140
You need to know how much you need God.

0:10:28.140,0:10:29.340
I cannot hear you.

0:10:29.340,0:10:31.400
You need to know how much you need God.

0:10:31.400,0:10:32.640
Again and again.

0:10:32.640,0:10:34.500
You need to know how much you need God.

0:10:34.500,0:10:41.660
Stand up now. Are you calling God to stand up? That is the problem.

0:10:41.660,0:10:47.320
Where did you get the strength to stand up? From God. But why are you not involving Him?

0:10:47.320,0:10:50.300
It means you are using your own strength to stand up.

0:10:50.300,0:10:54.080
I can see the reason why you have the spinal cord injury.

0:10:54.080,0:10:56.720
Let us stand up.

0:10:56.720,0:11:01.060
Sit down. Are you involving God?

0:11:01.060,0:11:03.500
Yes.

0:11:03.500,0:11:08.860
For the first time.

0:11:11.160,0:11:16.800
When you begin to recognize and to know that you need God even in the small things...

0:11:16.800,0:11:23.300
Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily life.

0:11:23.300,0:11:30.080
If you want to overcome and become victorious in this word, you must know how much you need God.

0:11:30.080,0:11:34.900
Can you greet your colleague? Give a handshake to your colleague.

0:11:34.900,0:11:39.480
Are you involving God?
Can you do that yourself?

0:11:39.480,0:11:40.500
You are involving God.

0:11:40.500,0:11:42.120
Yes.

0:11:42.120,0:11:49.160
Smile. Are you involving God to smile?

0:11:54.280,0:11:59.780
Take this from me: it shall be well with you!

0:11:59.780,0:12:02.160
Amen!

0:12:02.160,0:12:08.980
Satan is a very crafty person, trickish and tactical.

0:12:08.980,0:12:10.700
You have to involve God.

0:12:10.700,0:12:15.720
Those areas you fail to involve God are the areas satan is using.

0:12:15.720,0:12:22.100
You don't need to say, "I must pray before I sleep", if you have been praying already.

0:12:22.100,0:12:25.340
Sitting on the bed you have to involve God.

0:12:25.340,0:12:29.340
Laying and stretching your head on the the pillow you involve God.

0:12:29.340,0:12:35.140
When you lie down, you begin to meditate before you fall asleep.

0:12:35.140,0:12:42.820
You are praying before you stand up and go somewhere...

0:12:42.820,0:12:47.200
Then, there is no way for satan.

0:12:47.200,0:13:08.600
Those areas you find difficult to penetrate in your career, business, health or even marriage...

0:13:08.600,0:13:14.520
The One who watches over you never sleeps; why are you sleeping?

0:13:14.520,0:13:16.880
If you don't pray, you are sleeping.

0:13:16.880,0:13:19.840
He is watching over you 24/7.

0:13:19.840,0:13:24.300
You have to call Him 24/7; you have to involve Him 24/7.

0:13:24.300,0:13:28.520
As you are looking at me, are you involving God?

0:13:28.520,0:13:32.060
Something is going on in your heart, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:13:32.060,0:13:34.920
Just, "Thank You, Jesus!" is enough.

0:13:34.920,0:13:37.120
It is just enough.

0:13:37.120,0:13:41.080
"Thank you Jesus" - as you are looking at me.

0:13:41.080,0:13:42.820
It means you are involving Him.

0:13:42.820,0:13:48.400
"Thank You, Jesus", but I do not understand what this man is saying.

0:13:48.400,0:13:51.760
Please, give me an understanding.

0:13:51.760,0:13:54.900
"Thank You, Jesus" - just thank You, Jesus.

0:13:54.900,0:13:57.000
You want to sit down - "Thank You Jesus".

0:13:57.000,0:13:58.380
You stand up - "Thank You, Jesus".

0:13:58.380,0:14:00.300
You want to dance - "Thank You, Jesus".

0:14:00.300,0:14:04.120
You can start from there - "Thank You, Jesus".

0:14:04.120,0:14:14.640
When He hears your thanks, He will open the relationship for you; He will give you a Word to say.

0:14:14.640,0:14:17.540
"Thank You, Jesus" - look at me, I am moving.

0:14:17.540,0:14:22.740
You cannot see my lips moving but I am saying something.

0:14:22.740,0:14:26.740
What I am saying is, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:14:26.740,0:14:33.300
But you will never see me because I am not involving my flesh, my body.

0:14:33.300,0:14:42.500
I never involve them to say that so therefore, it is possible for me to do other things on the outside.

0:14:42.500,0:14:46.440
It is when I involve my body to say "thank You, Jesus", and you are now calling me,

0:14:46.440,0:14:48.020
I would not be able to answer you.

0:14:48.020,0:14:52.500
"Thank You, Jesus" - if I want to answer you, I need to stop saying "thank You, Jesus".

0:14:52.500,0:14:54.560
Ehe - what are you saying?

0:14:54.560,0:14:58.300
It is because I am involving my flesh.

0:14:58.300,0:15:01.480
We are fighting spirit beings.

0:15:01.480,0:15:21.800
If our weapon of warfare were carnal, I would need to give you a gun and cutlass.

0:15:21.800,0:15:30.040
But our weapon of warfare is not carnal because we are fighting spirit beings.

0:15:30.040,0:15:33.360
Even when I am moving now - I am giving and I am receiving.

0:15:33.360,0:15:38.240
If I am only giving, and I am not receiving I would be dry

0:15:38.240,0:15:42.440
OK, see me.

0:15:42.440,0:15:44.860
I am giving you, but I must receive.

0:15:44.860,0:15:49.040
To receive, my heart must involve with God.

0:15:49.040,0:15:51.800
While I am giving, I receive.

0:15:51.800,0:15:54.280
I give, I am being filled.

0:15:54.280,0:16:00.280
You give but you do not receive.

0:16:00.280,0:16:03.720
Faith is a believer's heart.

0:16:03.720,0:16:04.780
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:04.780,0:16:06.280
Faith is a believer's heart.

0:16:06.280,0:16:06.960
Again.

0:16:06.960,0:16:08.400
Faith is a believer's heart.

0:16:08.400,0:16:12.120
It is a believer's heart - that is faith.

0:16:12.120,0:16:18.400
If someone asks you, "what is faith?" - you say, "faith is a believer's heart".

0:16:18.400,0:16:22.360
Someone say, "faith is to expect God to do what He is expected to do".

0:16:22.360,0:16:23.480
That is the definition.

0:16:23.480,0:16:30.100
It is simple - faith is a believer's heart.

0:16:30.100,0:16:36.320
And when you live by faith, walk by faith, talk by faith...

0:16:36.320,0:16:40.680
I can be going, you listen to me and I am talking to God.

0:16:40.680,0:16:44.660
If I want to talk to you I say "how are you?", but at the same time I am talking to God,

0:16:44.660,0:16:48.740
because my heart is faith.

0:16:48.740,0:16:51.720
If I want to talk to you, it does not mean I should stop talking to God;

0:16:51.720,0:16:55.140
I can be talking to God and at the same time, talking to you.

0:16:55.140,0:16:59.220
Yes, because it is my heart.

0:16:59.220,0:17:18.960
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

0:17:18.960,0:17:36.260
Inner my heart

0:17:36.260,0:17:51.760
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

0:17:51.760,0:18:12.500
Inner my heart

0:18:12.500,0:18:29.380
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

0:18:29.380,0:18:43.100
That is why you can have any form of face; oval face, round face, be tall, fat, yellow, red, green,

0:18:43.100,0:18:51.240
but in our hearts, we are like Jesus.

0:18:51.240,0:18:54.920
A believer's heart is faith.

0:18:54.920,0:19:14.240
Inner my heart

0:19:14.240,0:19:29.980
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

0:19:29.980,0:19:30.780
Once again.

0:19:30.780,0:19:53.580
Inner my heart

0:19:53.580,0:20:11.660
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

0:20:11.660,0:20:21.980
Christianity lies in our hearts.

0:20:21.980,0:20:27.500
Begin to think about yourself.

0:20:27.500,0:20:32.200
Many of us are worshipping a God we do not know.

0:20:32.200,0:20:35.540
You never heard from Him before;

0:20:35.540,0:20:40.700
He never talked with you or acted with you and you never acted with Him.

0:20:40.700,0:20:48.560
You talk and act with Him by imagination.

0:20:48.560,0:20:57.460
Don't forget, while you are sitting down to say, "Thank You, Jesus" in your heart.

0:20:57.460,0:21:03.020
And begin to "fire-on" as you are looking at me, because as I am looking at you, I am fire.

0:21:03.020,0:21:10.140
What I say is what I receive, but I should also receive as I am giving you.

0:21:10.140,0:21:18.260
So, to receive from Him as I give you, my Spirit-man should also continue to "fire-on".

0:21:18.260,0:21:25.900
Begin to talk, "thank You, Jesus. I need more to give them".

0:21:25.900,0:21:35.940
As I give you my Spirit-man receives from Jesus, so I would not be "empty".

0:21:35.940,0:21:39.420
You may be seated, thank you.

0:21:39.420,0:21:44.700
Are you depending on Jesus to sit? What are you saying? "Thank You, Jesus".

0:21:44.700,0:21:50.360
Thank You, Jesus.

0:21:50.360,0:21:59.740
He loves it when you recognise Him, when you know He is your Lord and put Him where He belongs.

0:21:59.740,0:22:06.480
He is not one of those things; He is the only.

0:22:06.480,0:22:12.860
You make your plan. At the end of the day you say, "OK, I want to go to the church,

0:22:12.860,0:22:15.960
and I have to come back by 12 and go to the meeting".

0:22:15.960,0:22:18.680
You are making Him one of those things.

0:22:18.680,0:22:20.500
He is the only.

0:22:20.500,0:22:24.460
When you make a plan for the only one, do not miss that plan.

0:22:24.460,0:22:28.980
He is not a tenant, He is the landlord.

0:22:28.980,0:22:37.240
The challenge we have today is our upbringing.

0:22:37.240,0:22:38.980
Upbringing is still there.

0:22:38.980,0:22:44.880
We have not disconnected from upbringing in terms of our spiritual life.

0:22:44.880,0:22:54.400
Upbringing.

0:22:54.400,0:22:58.780
You are not yet what God says you are; you are like someone.

0:22:58.780,0:23:02.780
You look like somebody; your achievement is like somebody.

0:23:02.780,0:23:07.020
You talk like somebody; your behaviour is like somebody.

0:23:07.020,0:23:12.340
Your achievement can be compared with somebody - this is how he behaves.

0:23:12.340,0:23:14.820
That is why they don't miss you when you are not around,

0:23:14.820,0:23:18.480
because there are many people around who can do what you are doing.

0:23:18.480,0:23:21.620
You should be unique.

0:23:21.620,0:23:25.820
You are sent to make a difference.

0:23:25.820,0:23:28.080
You are pursuing what others have pursued.

0:23:28.080,0:23:32.480
What others have achieved is what you want to achieve.

0:23:32.480,0:23:35.180
You are not unique in any way.

0:23:35.180,0:23:38.540
If there is any uniqueness in your life - let me know.

0:23:38.540,0:23:47.840
Maybe your hair - you have blond hair, or you look tall, you are beautiful, or you are very rich,

0:23:47.840,0:23:52.840
there is no one as rich as you are, or you are an eloquent speaker.

0:23:52.840,0:23:59.700
No, you are not unique in any way. You are just like others. And why?

0:23:59.700,0:24:02.060
This is why the world is stagnant.

0:24:02.060,0:24:05.140
There were no differences in the world for past many years.

0:24:05.140,0:24:10.140
Since I was born I cannot see any difference in the world - the world is still the same.

0:24:10.140,0:24:14.960
Scientists cannot have a breakthrough any more. There is a trouble in the world.

0:24:14.960,0:24:18.960
There is no difference in the economy, no breakthrough in economy, no breakthrough in science,

0:24:18.960,0:24:22.200
no breakthrough in any area.

0:24:22.200,0:24:26.760
When we don’t have breakthrough, we continue to go around the cycle of life.

0:24:26.760,0:24:30.240
What we have used is what we keep using.

0:24:30.240,0:24:35.980
The idea we applied in the past is the same idea we are still applying.

0:24:35.980,0:24:38.400
The same idea.

0:24:38.400,0:24:43.660
In these days we talk of ideas appearing in the last 50 years.

0:24:43.660,0:24:50.320
Where were discoveries in different areas of life, but there is nothing like this any more.

0:24:50.320,0:24:52.060
Where are we going?

0:24:52.060,0:24:55.220
When you go to the airport you learn that there is no aircraft any more.

0:24:55.220,0:24:58.500
The little aircraft we have all over the world are damaged.

0:24:58.500,0:24:59.700
There is no a new one.

0:24:59.700,0:25:03.800
The exploitation of the one they discovered 5 years ago was stopped,

0:25:03.800,0:25:07.520
because it caused crisis and accidents all around the world.

0:25:07.520,0:25:12.420
The solar energy that you are talking about seems to be not reliable.

0:25:12.420,0:25:17.220
It is not yet confirmed, that the world can rely on that.

0:25:17.220,0:25:19.800
There is a crisis in the world.

0:25:19.800,0:25:22.440
There are no more discoveries.

0:25:22.440,0:25:33.920
We keep using old ideas, recycling...

0:25:33.920,0:25:35.860
Where are we going?

0:25:35.860,0:25:39.280
I will give you just a second or two minutes to think about your life.

0:25:39.280,0:25:45.220
Are you from Europe? Are you from Asia? Where are you from? Are you from Africa?

0:25:45.220,0:25:52.840
OK, sit down and think if there is any discovery in the world in your area.

0:25:52.840,0:25:58.260
We are running out of ideas.

0:25:58.260,0:26:11.000
The world is running out of ideas because we fail to carry God along.

0:26:11.000,0:26:16.800
We fail to know how much we need God.

0:26:16.800,0:26:19.720
You need to know how much you need God.

0:26:19.720,0:26:21.660
You need God to take a bath.

0:26:21.660,0:26:23.360
You need God to make up.

0:26:23.360,0:26:25.140
You need God to rub a cream.

0:26:25.140,0:26:27.360
You need God to look at the mirror.

0:26:27.360,0:26:34.180
The moment you know how much you need God, you are with God 24/7.

0:26:34.180,0:26:43.620
A break in God is a relationship with satan.

0:26:43.620,0:26:51.200
Just a break with God is a relationship with satan because there is no vacuum, no neutral world.

0:26:51.200,0:26:56.520
It is either you are dark or you are light.

0:26:56.520,0:27:03.200
When you are out of light, you are in darkness.

0:27:03.200,0:27:08.280
You may not confess satan but your faith is not practical.

0:27:08.280,0:27:11.280
Faith must be practical.

0:27:11.280,0:27:20.440
You must exercise your faith to show you believe because the belief in your heart is released by faith.

0:27:20.440,0:27:26.580
If I say I believe - to show I believe, my faith must be practised.

0:27:26.580,0:27:29.060
If I believe, where is my faith?

0:27:29.060,0:27:33.140
I believe Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour.

0:27:33.140,0:27:39.820
You believe Jesus is Saviour and your Lord. Where is your faith?

0:27:39.820,0:27:44.060
Faith is practical.

0:27:44.060,0:27:47.080
There is not abstract faith.

0:27:47.080,0:27:49.560
It must be practised.

0:27:49.560,0:27:55.300
If you have faith that is not practical, definitely, you have no faith.

0:27:55.300,0:27:59.860
"I believe" - where is your faith?

0:27:59.860,0:28:06.980
The belief in our heart can only be released by faith.

0:28:06.980,0:28:11.300
The question now: Are you a Christian?

0:28:11.300,0:28:15.280
Yes – it means you believe Jesus is your Lord and Saviour.

0:28:15.280,0:28:21.480
Yes – OK, show me your Saviour by faith.
