Good Morning, Church.

0:00:03.780,0:00:07.280
You may be seated, thank you.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:14.820,0:00:18.880
Viewers, thank you for your time.

0:00:18.880,0:00:21.820
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:27.380,0:00:38.400
Today, we’ll talk about how to be filled with the Holy Ghost as a Christian.

0:00:38.400,0:00:43.320
If Christians need to be filled with the Holy Ghost; how?

0:00:43.320,0:00:45.720
That is the question.

0:00:45.720,0:00:50.040
How?

0:00:50.040,0:00:55.760
HOW TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT

0:00:55.760,0:01:14.080
It is a core and fundamental area of the Gospel – to be filled with the Holy Ghost

0:01:14.080,0:01:20.680
because you cannot do anything for God, as far as God is concerned,

0:01:20.680,0:01:27.380
you cannot represent God, be involved in God’s projects without the Holy Ghost.

0:01:27.380,0:01:31.340
He who sees Him sees the Holy Ghost.

0:01:31.340,0:01:35.080
You cannot be a Christian without Him.

0:01:35.080,0:01:39.260
You know Jesus – you know the Holy Ghost.

0:01:39.260,0:01:42.780
This is why today we say, ‘Christians’ and ‘true Christians’.

0:01:42.780,0:01:47.220
It means there are Christians and there are also true ones.

0:01:47.220,0:01:52.400
In every area of life, there are fake; there are true.

0:01:52.400,0:01:56.920
Which one are you?

0:01:56.920,0:02:06.180
For several years I have been experiencing an encounter in this area,

0:02:06.180,0:02:09.480
going by what we are seeing every day in the ministry here.

0:02:09.480,0:02:17.760
This is an apostolic ministry - not just a ministry, but an apostolic ministry.

0:02:17.760,0:02:28.620
So, several years of experience and encounter.

0:02:28.620,0:02:37.420
I am going to share with you my personal experience, supported with the Holy Bible.

0:02:37.420,0:02:42.100
Referring you to those areas in the Bible -

0:02:42.100,0:02:48.660
my personal experience I'm going to share with you.

0:02:48.660,0:02:51.300
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

0:02:51.300,0:02:58.320
I am not going to say much about baptism of water, which is a human act.

0:02:58.320,0:03:02.440
When you are OK, they will just usher you for that baptism.

0:03:02.440,0:03:10.500
So, today, we will use Apostle Peter.

0:03:10.500,0:03:16.560
We are not going to go deep on baptism of water, but the Holy Ghost.

0:03:16.560,0:03:18.840
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

0:03:18.840,0:03:23.400
We have many books to support this,

0:03:23.400,0:03:35.920
but I will take my proof reading from the Book of Acts 10 - that will be my proof reading.

0:03:35.920,0:03:44.280
The other Book you have is John 14:26 - that will really help you.

0:03:44.280,0:03:52.800
And 1 Corinthians 12:1 – end.

0:03:52.800,0:03:54.320
That will really help.

0:03:54.320,0:04:07.400
And 1 Corinthians 2:13.

0:04:07.400,0:04:11.400
And Romans 14 about this issue of faith;

0:04:11.400,0:04:23.240
anything that does not come from faith is sin - Romans 14:5 - end.

0:04:23.240,0:04:31.740
And the Book of Colossians 3, and Ephesians 5 - that will help.

0:04:31.740,0:04:35.580
When you get home, take those Books, listen to the message.

0:04:35.580,0:04:37.380
Hallelujah.

0:04:37.380,0:04:45.900
Take the Book about 7 sons of Sceva - Acts 19:13.

0:04:45.900,0:04:47.580
OK, thank you.

0:04:47.580,0:04:49.620
Are you there?

0:04:49.620,0:04:51.320
Hallelujah.

0:04:51.320,0:04:55.140
So, let's take the Book of Acts 10.

0:04:55.140,0:04:59.340
Cornelius called for Peter - I'm just taking reading from verse 1.

0:04:59.340,0:05:07.240
“At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion

0:05:07.240,0:05:19.120
in what was known as the Italian Regiment.

0:05:19.120,0:05:30.320
He and all his family were devout and God-fearing;

0:05:30.320,0:05:39.940
he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.”

0:05:39.940,0:05:48.580
So, let's take our proof reading there - verse 44.

0:05:48.580,0:06:00.720
“While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.

0:06:00.720,0:06:11.280
The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished

0:06:11.280,0:06:18.220
that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles" -

0:06:18.220,0:06:28.060
that is unbelievers; people they were not expecting that this could reach, be poured on.

0:06:28.060,0:06:33.760
“For they heard them speaking in tongues"

0:06:33.760,0:06:36.360
We will talk about all this today.

0:06:36.360,0:06:40.540
“For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,”

0:06:40.540,0:06:47.340
‘Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water.'"

0:06:47.360,0:06:58.440
Like I told you, the baptism by water is a human act; take note of that.

0:06:58.440,0:07:03.060
“’They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have’.

0:07:03.060,0:07:08.460
So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:07:08.460,0:07:16.700
Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.”

0:07:16.700,0:07:20.480
Why should Peter have stayed with them for a few days?

0:07:20.480,0:07:25.360
For counselling, for guidance, for the purpose.

0:07:25.360,0:07:34.580
You have several Books here today, which are going to help you.

0:07:34.580,0:07:37.900
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

0:07:37.900,0:07:42.860
Christians must be filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:07:42.860,0:07:51.020
You must be filled with the Holy Spirit to be a Christian.

0:07:51.020,0:08:00.260
No one can do the work of God without the Holy Spirit.

0:08:00.260,0:08:23.560
Doing it without the Holy Spirit is tantamount to taking huge affliction, trouble, pain.

0:08:23.560,0:08:32.520
The Bible says that not everyone who says "Jesus is Lord" will do things with the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:08:32.520,0:08:36.440
You can say, do and preach, without the help of the Holy Spirit

0:08:36.440,0:08:49.520
but you will find that you are inflicting pain, wounds, harm on yourself.

0:08:49.520,0:08:52.160
So, let's quote Peter.

0:08:52.160,0:09:06.140
While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on the hearers.

0:09:06.140,0:09:10.880
What does that mean?

0:09:10.880,0:09:20.120
It means it fell on those who believed,

0:09:20.120,0:09:31.720
on those who prepared for the Holy Ghost,

0:09:31.720,0:09:46.720
meaning that God owned Peter’s words and bore witness to Peter’s words.

0:09:46.720,0:09:52.800
In other words, he was sent by God Himself.

0:09:52.800,0:10:02.600
That is the evidence to show he was sent by God Himself.

0:10:02.600,0:10:11.240
It was not Peter - it was a representative, an ambassador.

0:10:11.240,0:10:16.120
I will take you one by one, like I have told you - I'm going to share my encounter with the Holy Ghost,

0:10:16.120,0:10:17.840
so that it will be easy for you.

0:10:17.840,0:10:26.100
If I'm talking about what is in the Bible alone, it may seem to be difficult for you, but let's go.

0:10:26.100,0:10:28.500
Yes.

0:10:28.500,0:10:35.240
To be prepared for the Holy Ghost - "I want to be baptized, I really want to be filled with the Holy Ghost."

0:10:35.240,0:10:37.440
The step you are going to take:

0:10:37.440,0:10:43.280
Listen to me with all your heart.

0:10:43.280,0:10:48.580
You must listen to me with all your what?
- Heart.

0:10:48.580,0:11:00.200
The heart that holds grudges, offence, pain of the past – this is where your problem comes from.

0:11:00.200,0:11:10.140
Everyone here holds one offence or the other.

0:11:10.140,0:11:15.860
Unforgivingness - everyone here.

0:11:15.860,0:11:17.220
Viewers, listen to me:

0:11:17.220,0:11:22.160
Everyone holds one offence or the other.

0:11:22.160,0:11:27.960
You are claiming your rights, "How can I be cheated, insulted? Why?"

0:11:27.960,0:11:35.620
Whether you are cheated or not, offence is a crime to God.

0:11:35.620,0:11:44.760
Listen to me with all your heart but not a heart that holds offence or pain of the past.

0:11:44.760,0:11:48.860
But you are holding offence.

0:11:48.860,0:11:52.560
In the process of claiming your right, you are holding offence.

0:11:52.560,0:11:57.620
That is why it will be difficult for you to have my message with all your heart.

0:11:57.620,0:12:02.560
You will hear, you will see me as a lecturer...

0:12:02.560,0:12:07.140
In the school you hear, and it will go into your what?

0:12:07.140,0:12:09.940
Mental assent?

0:12:09.940,0:12:13.600
You receive it but not in your heart.

0:12:13.600,0:12:19.520
To receive the message with all your heart, your heart must be free.

0:12:19.520,0:12:22.800
Heart means man’s spirit.

0:12:22.800,0:12:28.700
How many of us have a free heart here today?

0:12:28.700,0:12:38.440
Heart that does not hold grudges, offence, heart that has nothing to do with yesterday,

0:12:38.440,0:12:43.760
whatever happened, unless the one that glorified God.

0:12:43.760,0:12:47.780
This is where you are!

0:12:47.780,0:12:54.860
This is why it will be difficult for you to listen to me with all your heart.

0:12:54.860,0:13:00.600
I'm sharing with you how you can be baptised,

0:13:00.600,0:13:07.940
how you can be filled with the Holy Ghost.

0:13:07.940,0:13:11.540
Listen!

0:13:11.540,0:13:22.540
You must listen to me with all your heart – a heart that does not hold offence.

0:13:22.540,0:13:33.880
Speak to yourself in Psalms in your heart as you are listening to me.

0:13:33.880,0:13:38.260
There is no neutral heart. You can't say, "Hm, I don't want to talk".

0:13:38.260,0:13:40.920
If you don’t want to talk, your heart will talk.

0:13:40.920,0:13:42.080
Something is going on.

0:13:42.080,0:13:47.460
Don’t allow your spirit to take hold of you; you control it.

0:13:47.460,0:13:53.280
"I must control you. While I'm listening to T.B. Joshua, I must control my heart."

0:13:53.280,0:14:00.400
Speak to yourself in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs,

0:14:00.400,0:14:04.480
making melodies in your heart to God.

0:14:04.480,0:14:08.760
But how many hearts now are engaged in those...?

0:14:08.760,0:14:11.020
A lot of things are going on in your heart.

0:14:11.020,0:14:12.660
"What is going to happen today?"

0:14:12.660,0:14:16.660
Don’t allow your heart to control you.

0:14:16.660,0:14:23.080
As a Christian, speak to your heart in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.

0:14:23.080,0:14:30.200
Make melodies in your heart.
That is how to receive.

0:14:30.200,0:14:36.660
By the time you get hold of your heart, you are about to be filled.

0:14:36.660,0:14:40.540
You cannot get hold of your heart; your heart is jumping up and down.

0:14:40.540,0:14:46.200
A lot of things are going on, "My business. Let me look at my time."

0:14:46.200,0:14:51.360
That is why sometimes you don't need to go to the restroom, the diabetes you are talking about.

0:14:51.360,0:14:53.840
It is because you are not getting hold of your heart.

0:14:53.840,0:14:57.020
When your heart is jumping, "I have not gone to the toilet today"

0:14:57.020,0:15:00.860
- immediately you have the sense of going to the toilet.

0:15:00.860,0:15:05.860
"I have not eaten today" - immediately you have the sense of eating.

0:15:05.860,0:15:11.780
"I have not made a call to my brother today" - immediately you receive a call.

0:15:11.780,0:15:14.280
The real battle is in our heart.

0:15:14.280,0:15:17.000
For - against.

0:15:17.000,0:15:21.280
If you can control your heart, get hold of your heart, the sky is your limit.

0:15:21.280,0:15:22.120
Tell your neighbour,

0:15:22.120,0:15:28.760
If you can get hold of your heart, the sky is your limit.

0:15:28.760,0:15:34.000
You leave your heart; you are looking at me and your heart is free to say whatever it wants to say.

0:15:34.000,0:15:36.520
Don't allow that!

0:15:36.520,0:15:41.660
As you are looking at me, take hold of your heart.

0:15:41.660,0:15:47.760
"Take more of me, give me more of You; more of Your faithfulness, kindness, goodness..." -

0:15:47.760,0:15:53.820
a lot of Bible Psalms, hymns, melodies.

0:15:53.820,0:15:58.340
"Jesus, Jesus..." - that alone is OK.

0:15:58.340,0:16:05.320
"Jesus, Jesus..."

0:16:05.320,0:16:11.600
"Jesus, locate me in Your mercy."

0:16:11.600,0:16:17.920
Give your heart assignments.

0:16:17.920,0:16:22.100
If you don’t give your heart assignments, your heart will look for assignments.

0:16:22.100,0:16:27.160
"Oh, look at that hair-style. Look at that dress.

0:16:27.160,0:16:32.460
Look at that beautiful woman. Look at that handsome man.

0:16:32.460,0:16:38.620
This church - there are a lot of changes. Oh my God."

0:16:38.620,0:16:41.220
Your heart will be roaming about.

0:16:41.220,0:16:45.600
If you don't give a message to your heart, your heart will be just doing whatever,

0:16:45.600,0:16:51.660
"Look at the fruit; will I have one today? What is going to happen? Oh, this church is beautiful.

0:16:51.660,0:16:56.260
Oh, look at this man; I like his suit - I think I can get it.

0:16:56.260,0:17:04.020
I saw one jeep at the car-park today; I think I'm going to make a photo of this jeep."

0:17:04.020,0:17:09.100
Your heart keeps roaming about; this is what is putting you in trouble.

0:17:09.100,0:17:11.280
This is what will distance you from God.

0:17:11.280,0:17:14.700
This is why you are not filled with the Spirit.

0:17:14.700,0:17:16.540
Talk to your heart!

0:17:16.540,0:17:19.180
Keep your heart busy; get hold of your heart!

0:17:19.180,0:17:21.280
This is my life.

0:17:21.280,0:17:27.860
When I'm going, I will not even know that you are passing me, because I'm busy in my heart.

0:17:27.860,0:17:34.560
You think that because I am not talking I am not busy - I am busy.

0:17:34.560,0:17:40.380
Sometimes, when I watch TV, a football game...

0:17:40.380,0:17:45.520
You think that I'm watching football; only my eyes are watching but my heart,

0:17:45.520,0:17:50.180
"Take more of me, give me more of You. Lord".

0:17:50.180,0:17:58.000
By the time I say, "Jesus!" - maybe someone is wounded on the field -

0:17:58.000,0:18:02.380
it means what I'm saying is what I...

0:18:02.380,0:18:06.940
Or when I'm sleeping, my nature is to keep my heart busy.

0:18:06.940,0:18:12.380
I give my heart a job, not my heart giving me job.

0:18:12.380,0:18:15.320
Your heart is giving you job.

0:18:15.320,0:18:20.680
When I'm sleeping - you think I'm sleeping; it is only my body.

0:18:20.680,0:18:21.920
Come and attack me.

0:18:21.920,0:18:24.320
I say, "Jesus!"

0:18:24.320,0:18:28.220
But you, "Honey!"

0:18:28.220,0:18:29.240
Which honey?

0:18:29.240,0:18:31.120
Can honey help you?

0:18:31.120,0:18:34.200
Your honey will say, "What has happened, dear?"

0:18:34.200,0:18:40.700
"Don't worry, these people."

0:18:40.700,0:18:46.120
Some will say, "Leave me!"

0:18:46.120,0:18:49.180
"What is happening? Honey, what is wrong?"

0:18:49.180,0:18:53.940
The name of Jesus is "leave me" - this is the life you are living.

0:18:53.940,0:18:59.160
Even when you are inside a vehicle, and the car is about to get an accident;

0:18:59.160,0:19:05.980
in the process of somersaulting, "Honey, Honey!"

0:19:05.980,0:19:07.820
Can your honey help you?

0:19:07.820,0:19:10.460
Because you are not used to it.

0:19:10.460,0:19:14.500
At the end of the day; maybe you are trapped, they are giving you food in the dream,

0:19:14.500,0:19:17.180
or the accident has happened, you say, "Jesus!"

0:19:17.180,0:19:23.060
It has happened already - why are you calling Jesus?

0:19:23.060,0:19:25.320
Hallelujah!

0:19:25.320,0:19:28.520
Yes.

0:19:28.520,0:19:33.260
Don't forget our message today.

0:19:33.260,0:19:36.660
HOW TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT

0:19:36.660,0:20:03.200
The Word and the Spirit are inseparable; that is, intimately linked together.

0:20:03.200,0:20:06.820
The Word and the Spirit - you cannot separate these.

0:20:06.820,0:20:09.340
You cannot just come and say, "Jesus!"

0:20:09.340,0:20:15.060
By what authority are you calling Jesus?

0:20:15.060,0:20:22.320
The Word and the Spirit are intimately linked together.

0:20:22.320,0:20:26.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:26.480,0:20:40.220
If you want to live, talk, smile, sleep, eat in the Spirit, keep in the Word,

0:20:40.220,0:20:51.580
live in the Word, abide in the Word and become totally saturated with the Scripture.

0:20:51.580,0:20:59.520
You will find yourself overflowing with the Spirit.

0:20:59.520,0:21:02.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:02.360,0:21:03.200
Tell your neighbour,

0:21:03.200,0:21:13.640
If you want to live in the Spirit, that is, to be filled with the Spirit,

0:21:13.640,0:21:16.220
living in the Spirit is living with Jesus.

0:21:16.220,0:21:18.560
Sleeping in the Spirit is sleeping with Jesus.

0:21:18.560,0:21:21.280
Eating in the Spirit is eating with Jesus.

0:21:21.280,0:21:22.080
Tell your neighbour,

0:21:22.080,0:21:32.580
If you want to live in the Spirit, keep in the Word, abide in the Word,

0:21:32.580,0:21:45.280
become totally saturated with the Scripture and you will find yourself overflowing with the Spirit.

0:21:45.280,0:21:49.400
Not just flow, but overflowing with the Spirit.

0:21:49.400,0:21:54.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:54.000,0:21:57.940
If I may take you back again, because I don't want this message to just go.

0:21:57.940,0:22:07.800
I'm not a lecturer, I'm just telling you the message God has given me to tell you.

0:22:07.800,0:22:10.120
What is going on in your heart now?

0:22:10.120,0:22:16.960
Madam, as you are sitting, you must take control of your heart.

0:22:16.960,0:22:21.500
If you don't take control of your heart, your heart will be jumping up and down.

0:22:21.500,0:22:26.660
You will see someone who put a wig on there, someone who is talking there,

0:22:26.660,0:22:28.360
someone who is shouting there, someone...

0:22:28.360,0:22:34.380
You will be looking at T.B. Joshua, "Oh, this is a beautiful attire".

0:22:34.380,0:22:36.380
Take hold of your heart.

0:22:36.380,0:22:46.800
Now, continue to speak to your heart in hymns, in psalms,

0:22:46.800,0:22:50.720
"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. Take more of me, give me more of You."

0:22:50.720,0:22:58.060
A lot of things, messages, spiritual songs in your heart, make melody in your heart to God,

0:22:58.060,0:23:11.500
"Thank You, Lord... Jesus Christ... Locate me in Your mercy..."

0:23:11.500,0:23:15.200
Keep busy in your heart.

0:23:15.200,0:23:22.740
Before you know it, you will start speaking in tongues, you will find yourself in another realm.

0:23:22.740,0:23:28.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:28.980,0:23:30.200
Not only here.

0:23:30.200,0:23:42.260
When you are at home, when you are eating, "Locate me in Your mercy..."

0:23:42.260,0:23:47.540
When your heart is talking, your lips cannot move - I'm just telling you what your heart will engage in.

0:23:47.540,0:23:52.920
"Locate me in Your mercy. Take more of me." - you have to engage your heart.

0:23:52.920,0:23:54.220
That is the prayer.

0:23:54.220,0:23:57.160
The prayers you are offering today are not prayers.

0:23:57.160,0:24:03.100
The real prayer is engaging your heart, "Take more of me, give me more of You" - that is the prayer.

0:24:03.100,0:24:10.520
But the one you offer, "Lord Jesus - thank You, Lord..." - that is not prayer, you are speaking to yourself.

0:24:10.520,0:24:14.700
That is why your prayers are not answered.

0:24:14.700,0:24:16.400
The real prayer...

0:24:16.400,0:24:23.600
When you begin to engage your heart, you will not go where Jesus will not be welcome.

0:24:23.600,0:24:26.780
You will not say what Jesus would not want you to say.

0:24:26.780,0:24:28.580
I want to ask a question.

0:24:28.580,0:24:37.380
When did the Spirit move?

0:24:37.380,0:24:51.500
It was when Peter started speaking that the Spirit began to move.

0:24:51.500,0:24:56.920
Before I will go further; I hope you have captured how to be filled?

0:24:56.920,0:24:59.600
Have you captured it?

0:24:59.600,0:25:01.820
Your heart, I repeat again,

0:25:01.820,0:25:04.380
keep your heart; get hold of your heart.

0:25:04.380,0:25:09.340
You allow your heart to continue to throw you into problems and afflictions,

0:25:09.340,0:25:18.120
throwing you over this, diabetes, this, that, thinking about that - no!

0:25:18.120,0:25:20.780
Speak to your heart.

0:25:20.780,0:25:26.460
You see me going; I'm engaging my heart, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:25:26.460,0:25:29.220
I'm telling you now what I engage my heart with.

0:25:29.220,0:25:35.960
"Thank You, Jesus..."

0:25:35.960,0:25:40.260
I'm saying, "Thank You, Jesus" in my heart, but my lips - no one knows.

0:25:40.260,0:25:45.860
If you call me, I will answer you, I will greet you, because it is my heart that is engaged, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:25:45.860,0:25:52.620
If somebody just comes out to attack me, that attack Jesus will... - He will defend me.

0:25:52.620,0:25:56.780
You always wait for an attack, before you call Jesus.

0:25:56.780,0:26:00.680
You always wait for the situation, before you call Jesus.

0:26:00.680,0:26:04.280
You always wait for a time when you need Him, before you call Him.

0:26:04.280,0:26:05.300
Tell your neighbour,

0:26:05.300,0:26:09.420
You don’t know how much you need Him.

0:26:09.420,0:26:10.900
I cannot heart you.

0:26:10.900,0:26:12.820
You don’t know how much you need Him.

0:26:12.820,0:26:14.000
I cannot hear you.

0:26:14.000,0:26:15.980
You don’t know how much you need Him.

0:26:15.980,0:26:19.360
Me? - I don't wait for anything.

0:26:19.360,0:26:27.680
As I'm walking, "Locate me in Your mercy...", but my lips are OK, you cannot know.

0:26:27.680,0:26:31.840
That's why sometimes, when you call me, "Good Morning, sir",

0:26:31.840,0:26:35.300
I don't answer promptly because I'm busy.

0:26:35.300,0:26:41.320
If you call me, when you engage with me on the phone, "Hello!",

0:26:41.320,0:26:47.300
you think I can't hear what you are saying; I hear, but because my heart is engaged -

0:26:47.300,0:26:55.500
"How are you? Where are you now? OK, I'm in the church."

0:26:55.500,0:27:03.160
Because I'm screening your voice to know who is talking - whether it is ogbanje or witchcraft.

0:27:03.160,0:27:06.880
Voice is more powerful than anything.

0:27:06.880,0:27:10.040
OK, last Sunday you saw what happened.

0:27:10.040,0:27:17.760
I stood here and I began to say, "In the name of Jesus...", out there you saw people vomiting,

0:27:17.760,0:27:23.380
coming out, pool of blood, menstruation, fibroid, everything - you saw it.

0:27:23.380,0:27:27.860
Voice - it is voice!

0:27:27.860,0:27:34.300
At home, all over the world people are getting delivered by mere looking at me, listening to me.

0:27:34.300,0:27:38.040
So, this handset...

0:27:38.040,0:27:42.180
They get you proper there.

0:27:42.180,0:27:51.580
Not everybody listening to me is going to be filled with the Holy Ghost.

0:27:51.580,0:27:55.700
Going by what we have read in Acts 10:44,

0:27:55.700,0:28:01.620
not everybody listening to me is going to be filled with the Holy Ghost.

0:28:01.620,0:28:14.720
I would not want you to come and kneel down and ask God to fill you

0:28:14.720,0:28:18.160
when you are not prepared.

0:28:18.160,0:28:21.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:21.080,0:28:26.040
I would not want you to come and kneel down and ask God to fill you

0:28:26.040,0:28:29.760
when you are not prepared

0:28:29.760,0:28:40.600
because the Holy Ghost is not received by everyone, only those who are prepared for Him.

0:28:40.600,0:28:45.260
And I have told you about the preparation, which you have received today.

0:28:45.260,0:28:49.880
Get hold of your heart.

0:28:49.880,0:28:54.120
Speak to yourself in Psalms.

0:28:54.120,0:28:57.240
Speak to yourself in hymns.

0:28:57.240,0:28:59.980
Speak to yourself in spiritual songs.

0:28:59.980,0:29:03.440
Make melodies in your heart to God.

0:29:03.440,0:29:10.060
Colossians 3, Ephesians 5 - you will find it there.

0:29:10.060,0:29:15.620
I would like to have you meditate on the Scriptures.

0:29:15.620,0:29:24.040
The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible,

0:29:24.040,0:29:30.440
and turn it over and over again in your heart,

0:29:30.440,0:29:37.740
the more your heart acts upon the Word.

0:29:37.740,0:29:42.580
Turn it over and over again in your heart.

0:29:42.580,0:29:52.940
Tell your neighbour, "Turn it over and over again in your heart."

0:29:52.940,0:29:55.200
You know what I mean?

0:29:55.200,0:30:02.980
It is like you are pounding yam; turn it over...

0:30:02.980,0:30:09.540
The more your heart, your spirit acts upon the Word.

0:30:09.540,0:30:15.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:15.020,0:30:18.580
Acts upon the Word.

0:30:18.580,0:30:20.440
It’s not just to read.

0:30:20.440,0:30:24.340
Read!

0:30:24.340,0:30:32.900
Turn it over and over again in your heart, what you read;

0:30:32.900,0:30:39.260
the more your heart acts upon the Word.

0:30:39.260,0:30:47.100
If you are not grounded in the Word,

0:30:47.100,0:30:53.520
there will be nothing for the Spirit to hold on.

0:30:53.520,0:30:57.980
In the Book of John 14:26 it says,

0:30:57.980,0:31:03.820
there will be nothing for the Spirit to remind you of.

0:31:03.820,0:31:08.280
That is John 14:26.

0:31:08.280,0:31:16.000
It must remind you of: thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not destroy, thou shalt not this, thou shalt not that.

0:31:16.000,0:31:24.960
If you are not grounded in the Word of God, there will be nothing for the Spirit to remind you of:

0:31:24.960,0:31:30.100
thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not...

0:31:30.100,0:31:31.520
If there is nothing...

0:31:31.520,0:31:41.620
The Spirit will be released to the extent, measure, degree

0:31:41.620,0:31:46.860
we stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.

0:31:46.860,0:31:47.880
I repeat again.

0:31:47.880,0:31:59.160
The Spirit of God will be released to you to the extent, measure, degree

0:31:59.160,0:32:05.840
you stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.

0:32:05.840,0:32:11.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:11.780,0:32:14.600
How do you honour His Word?

0:32:14.600,0:32:24.280
You say, "Jesus must be honoured...in my life every day".

0:32:24.280,0:32:31.000
They are talking about His Word.

0:32:31.000,0:32:34.480
Jesus and His Word are one.

0:32:34.480,0:32:48.760
The Spirit will be released to you to the extent, degree, measure

0:32:48.760,0:32:55.160
you stand in reverence, honour of His Word.

0:32:55.160,0:32:59.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:59.100,0:33:10.580
Before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must be sure that you can.

0:33:10.580,0:33:11.340
Tell your neighbour,

0:33:11.340,0:33:20.960
Before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must be sure that you can.

0:33:20.960,0:33:22.180
Take note of that.

0:33:22.180,0:33:30.940
Secondly, before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must desire that.

0:33:30.940,0:33:33.780
You read so much about the Spirit of God.

0:33:33.780,0:33:39.840
You read about an accommodation that you need to prepare for the Spirit of God.

0:33:39.840,0:33:44.500
What is the accommodation?

0:33:44.500,0:33:50.540
What He wants, what He doesn't want - put those things together.

0:33:50.540,0:33:53.280
Put your home in order.

0:33:53.280,0:34:03.520
If your home is in disarray, disorder - you must think how to arrange your home before He comes.

0:34:03.520,0:34:11.020
Before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must be sure that you can.

0:34:11.020,0:34:20.520
I'm telling you my personal experience of several years and supporting it with the scripture for you.

0:34:20.520,0:34:24.500
If I now go into the Scripture, begin to tell you when I'm not filled,

0:34:24.500,0:34:27.260
definitely, it would be difficult for you to understand.

0:34:27.260,0:34:34.460
That is why what you are reading over and over, everywhere, you cannot practice.

0:34:34.460,0:34:47.800
Are you sure that you want to be possessed by a Spirit?

0:34:47.800,0:34:57.280
Are you sure that you can be possessed by a Spirit?

0:34:57.280,0:35:00.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:00.960,0:35:07.180
This Spirit is like Jesus.

0:35:07.180,0:35:14.820
There are two kinds of spirit possession.

0:35:14.820,0:35:32.640
Evil spirit possession, where the human personality is taken over -

0:35:32.640,0:35:53.940
making them filthy, dumb or evil as we can see them being delivered or cast out today.

0:35:53.940,0:35:59.480
The Holy Spirit wants to possess us Christians.

0:35:59.480,0:36:00.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:36:00.220,0:36:08.160
The Holy Spirit wants to possess us Christians

0:36:08.160,0:36:14.820
because there is no way you can be a Christian without the Holy Ghost.

0:36:14.820,0:36:20.000
The Holy Ghost wants to possess us Christians.

0:36:20.000,0:36:27.740
This Spirit is like Jesus.

0:36:27.740,0:36:33.640
Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?

0:36:33.640,0:36:34.980
Ask your neighbour.

0:36:34.980,0:36:38.900
Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?

0:36:38.900,0:36:40.120
I cannot hear you.

0:36:40.120,0:36:43.700
Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?

0:36:43.700,0:36:45.020
I cannot hear you.

0:36:45.020,0:36:48.040
Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?

0:36:48.040,0:36:49.480
I cannot hear you.

0:36:49.480,0:36:59.940
Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?

0:36:59.940,0:37:07.720
You know Jesus – you know the Holy Spirit.

0:37:07.720,0:37:17.440
If truly you know Jesus, are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?

0:37:17.440,0:37:19.460
I know Jesus – I know the Holy Spirit.

0:37:19.460,0:37:20.520
Tell your neighbour.

0:37:20.520,0:37:22.680
I know Jesus – I know the Holy Spirit.

0:37:22.680,0:37:31.160
If truly you know Jesus, you know the Holy Spirit.

0:37:31.160,0:37:36.920
Because we are not sure; truly, we don't know Jesus.

0:37:36.920,0:37:39.740
You say you know Jesus and you don't know the Holy Spirit -

0:37:39.740,0:37:42.080
it means you don't know Jesus.

0:37:42.080,0:37:45.620
You say, "I know Jesus", but you don't know the Holy Spirit -

0:37:45.620,0:37:49.280
it means you don't know Jesus.

0:37:49.280,0:37:55.960
Many people say they are Christians; they are not Christians, they are religious people.

0:37:55.960,0:37:57.460
You say you are a Christian.

0:37:57.460,0:38:03.300
If truly you are a Christian, you know Jesus, and if you know Jesus, you know the Holy Spirit.

0:38:03.300,0:38:07.240
But here, I can't see the Holy Spirit in the life of people.

0:38:07.240,0:38:10.080
You know Jesus?
You know the Holy Spirit.

0:38:10.080,0:38:17.240
Truly, if you know Jesus, you know the Holy Spirit because they are inseparable,

0:38:17.240,0:38:24.920
intimately linked together.

0:38:24.920,0:38:30.180
It is when one is filled with the Spirit, then you can be baptised.

0:38:30.180,0:38:34.440
But you are not filled with the Holy Spirit and you are now going for a baptism -

0:38:34.440,0:38:37.260
you can never be filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:38:37.260,0:38:40.360
That is the challenge you are facing.

0:38:40.360,0:38:44.780
You say you are not a graduate, you never attended university,

0:38:44.780,0:38:49.140
but you bought a certificate that you have 2nd class upper.

0:38:49.140,0:38:52.120
Can you now go back to the university?

0:38:52.120,0:38:54.320
That is the problem you are facing.

0:38:54.320,0:38:55.040
Tell your neighbour,

0:38:55.040,0:39:04.820
Because you have been baptised by water, it is difficult for you to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:39:04.820,0:39:11.460
Because things are in ascending order, but now you are taking descending order.

0:39:11.460,0:39:14.960
You know you are not filled with the Spirit, but you are now being baptised.

0:39:14.960,0:39:23.260
You can tell your pastor, "Pastor please, I'm not filled with the Holy Spirit. Don't baptise me; it's a curse".

0:39:23.260,0:39:27.180
Can't you hear what Peter said, "We cannot stop these people from being baptised by the water

0:39:27.180,0:39:31.020
because they are filled".

0:39:31.020,0:39:32.520
Are you with me?

0:39:32.520,0:39:36.500
If you are not a graduate and you bought a certificate which says you are a graduate,

0:39:36.500,0:39:40.760
and you say you have 2nd class upper and you are now working,

0:39:40.760,0:39:43.500
can you now turn around and say, "I'm going to the university"?

0:39:43.500,0:39:46.520
Will they not query you about the certificate you have?

0:39:46.520,0:39:50.000
So, the same way, you are baptised in the water;

0:39:50.000,0:39:53.440
can you now turn around and say, "I need the Holy Spirit now"?

0:39:53.440,0:39:55.140
Unless you are delivered.

0:39:55.140,0:39:59.420
Say, "I need deliverance".

0:39:59.420,0:40:00.740
Deliverance of what?

0:40:00.740,0:40:04.620
Of water baptism.

0:40:04.620,0:40:06.140
You need deliverance?

0:40:06.140,0:40:10.980
Deliverance of what?
- Water baptism.

0:40:10.980,0:40:19.040
Even to say it out, it is difficult for you.

0:40:19.040,0:40:24.460
Deliverance of what?
- Water baptism.

0:40:24.460,0:40:29.700
You have been baptised with the water.

0:40:29.700,0:40:33.300
Double...

0:40:33.300,0:40:37.380
Overhauling.

0:40:37.380,0:40:41.900
Oh my God.

0:40:41.900,0:40:46.060
Yes, we are on the way to the filling.

0:40:46.060,0:40:50.540
After this message, I know you will know the way out now.

0:40:50.540,0:40:56.600
The way out has come.

0:40:56.600,0:40:59.140
Halleluja!

0:40:59.140,0:41:06.540
If you claim to know Jesus and you don’t know the Holy Spirit, you are deceiving yourself.

0:41:06.540,0:41:12.580
What is the role of the Holy Spirit?

0:41:12.580,0:41:36.660
A Spirit – pure, sane, gentle, wise, loving – for that is exactly what He is like.

0:41:36.660,0:41:50.100
A Spirit – pure, sane, gentle, wise – for that is exactly what He is like.

0:41:50.100,0:41:55.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:41:55.280,0:42:06.700
The Holy Spirit is pure – He is the Holy Spirit.

0:42:06.700,0:42:13.760
He is wise for He is the Spirit of Wisdom.

0:42:13.760,0:42:20.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:42:20.460,0:42:25.460
He is true for He is the Spirit of Truth.

0:42:25.460,0:42:37.200
He is like Jesus for He is the Spirit of Christ.

0:42:37.200,0:42:42.820
He is like the Father for He is the Spirit of the Father.

0:42:42.820,0:42:48.300
This Spirit wants to possess you.

0:42:48.300,0:43:06.420
This Spirit wants to be your Lord

0:43:06.420,0:43:17.140
so that you will no longer be in control

0:43:17.140,0:43:21.600
of the little vessel in which you sail - your body.

0:43:21.600,0:43:29.060
You know, I'm the one sailing this one - this is a little vessel.

0:43:29.060,0:43:38.720
He wants to be in charge and take over from me because without Him, I will not be able to stand;

0:43:38.720,0:43:45.160
I will not be able to be pure, wise, loving, gentle.

0:43:45.160,0:43:53.240
He wants to take control of this little vessel and sail it by Himself.

0:43:53.240,0:43:56.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:56.880,0:44:06.980
Are you sure you want to be possessed by the blessed Spirit of the Father and Son?

0:44:06.980,0:44:17.860
Because you often like to be in charge – founder, general overseer.

0:44:17.860,0:44:23.380
“I want to do this today, another tomorrow”,

0:44:23.380,0:44:27.900
whereas God owns our future.

0:44:27.900,0:44:34.600
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:44:34.600,0:44:36.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:44:36.220,0:44:50.120
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:44:50.120,0:44:51.960
Again, ask your neighbour.

0:44:51.960,0:44:55.960
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:44:55.960,0:44:57.320
Again.

0:44:57.320,0:45:01.100
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:45:01.100,0:45:02.400
Again.

0:45:02.400,0:45:05.820
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:45:05.820,0:45:07.360
Again and again.

0:45:07.360,0:45:10.580
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:45:10.580,0:45:11.980
Again and again.

0:45:11.980,0:45:15.520
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:45:15.520,0:45:17.000
I cannot hear you.

0:45:17.000,0:45:20.960
Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:45:20.960,0:45:29.940
Do you want your personality to be taken over by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:45:29.940,0:45:36.960
You will not wake up and say, "Yes, help me iron these three suits.

0:45:36.960,0:45:48.520
I will wear this one on Monday, this one on Tuesday, this one on Wednesday"; as if you are God.

0:45:48.520,0:45:54.740
How do you know that you will see tomorrow?

0:45:54.740,0:45:56.760
Tell me.

0:45:56.760,0:45:59.840
We are in the world; you have seen so much.

0:45:59.840,0:46:08.280
People say, "I will see you tomorrow" - the next thing you learn is that person is in the graveyard.

0:46:08.280,0:46:16.140
Do you want your personality to be taken over by Someone who is like Jesus?

0:46:16.140,0:46:32.840
If you want that, begin to see today as if it is your last day on earth.

0:46:32.840,0:46:34.300
I cannot hear you.

0:46:34.300,0:46:37.300
If you want that, begin to see today as if it is your last day on earth.

0:46:37.300,0:46:44.220
If you want your personality to be taken over by Someone who is like Jesus,

0:46:44.220,0:46:50.320
right now, begin to see now as if it’s your last day on earth.

0:46:50.320,0:46:55.080
Now, begin to see today as if it’s your last day on earth.

0:46:55.080,0:46:58.620
If you see today as if it is your last day on earth - you know;

0:46:58.620,0:47:01.120
all those things you keep somewhere...

0:47:01.120,0:47:10.220
There are poor people on the street; instead of sharing with them, helping them, you promise this or that...

0:47:10.220,0:47:14.400
This is all propaganda.

0:47:14.400,0:47:18.140
How do you know?

0:47:18.140,0:47:22.800
Begin to see today as if it’s your last day on earth

0:47:22.800,0:47:26.480
if you want your personality to be taken over by Jesus.

0:47:26.480,0:47:34.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:47:34.840,0:47:42.340
If you are not filled with the Spirit, you cannot obey the written Word.

0:47:42.340,0:47:46.240
Let me show you.

0:47:46.240,0:47:47.240
You see it?

0:47:47.240,0:47:50.960
Let me see your own.

0:47:50.960,0:47:53.700
Raise your own up.

0:47:53.700,0:47:55.100
Say to yourself.

0:47:55.100,0:48:18.180
If I am not filled with the Spirit, I cannot obey the written Word.

0:48:18.180,0:48:23.540
This is why all what you are reading here is like literature to you.

0:48:23.540,0:48:25.140
It is just mere literature.

0:48:25.140,0:48:31.380
You read to preach, to teach; you don't read to live in it.

0:48:31.380,0:48:40.540
You cannot live it; you cannot read what is here, if you are not filled with the Spirit.

0:48:40.540,0:48:47.980
You can preach, you read it to teach it, to preach it, to counsel people,

0:48:47.980,0:48:53.600
but to live in it, you cannot because there is no way you can.

0:48:53.600,0:49:10.140
If you don’t obey the Scripture, you quench Him.

0:49:10.140,0:49:15.240
Can you see the importance of the Spirit?

0:49:15.240,0:49:21.180
If you don’t obey the Scripture, you quench Him;

0:49:21.180,0:49:28.880
you are not a Christian, irrespective of your knowledge in the Bible.

0:49:28.880,0:49:38.640
If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you cannot obey the Word of God

0:49:38.640,0:49:47.520
because the holy men were carried along by the Spirit as they were writing the Word.

0:49:47.520,0:49:50.360
It is not a literature, it is not something you can put here.

0:49:50.360,0:49:59.120
You can memorize it, you can keep it in your mind - but to keep it in your heart, no way without the Spirit.

0:49:59.120,0:50:01.520
I want to leave you.

0:50:01.520,0:50:04.180
Can you give me your word?

0:50:04.180,0:50:10.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:50:10.340,0:50:14.280
Can somebody answer this question?

0:50:14.280,0:50:19.460
How will you be filled with the Spirit?

0:50:19.460,0:50:21.340
Can somebody?

0:50:21.340,0:50:25.600
Because without the Spirit of God you cannot obey the written Word.

0:50:25.600,0:50:33.360
You are not filled with the Spirit and you are carrying the Bible.

0:50:33.360,0:50:33.980
Tell your neighbour,

0:50:33.980,0:50:39.940
You are not filled with the Spirit and you are carrying the Bible.

0:50:39.940,0:50:46.340
The Bible you carry is not only a Bible; there is a Bible and there is Holy Bible.

0:50:46.340,0:50:56.740
The Bible is history, events that happened to apostles and God's generals,

0:50:56.740,0:51:00.020
but the holy, it has to do...

0:51:00.020,0:51:02.020
OK, can somebody answer this question?

0:51:02.020,0:51:04.280
How will you be filled with the Spirit?

0:51:04.280,0:51:08.900
OK, give it to my brother.

0:51:08.900,0:51:10.980
By meditating upon His Word.

0:51:10.980,0:51:13.940
What are you meditating on?

0:51:13.940,0:51:16.640
The Word of God.

0:51:16.640,0:51:19.520
- Are you doing that now?
- Yes, sir.

0:51:19.520,0:51:20.540
- Now, now, now?
- Yes, sir.

0:51:20.540,0:51:22.760
Can you tell us what are you meditating on?

0:51:22.760,0:51:25.040
Psalm 28:7.

0:51:25.040,0:51:26.980
- As you are looking at me?
- Yes, sir.

0:51:26.980,0:51:29.560
- Even as you are talking to me?
- Yes, sir.

0:51:29.560,0:51:32.040
While you are talking to me, you cannot stop your meditation.

0:51:32.040,0:51:36.420
Meditation is a thing of the heart; it is different from thinking.

0:51:36.420,0:51:42.340
Thinking is lower level; upper level is meditation.

0:51:42.340,0:51:48.980
Meditation has to do with Heaven, knowledge of Heaven

0:51:48.980,0:51:52.180
but thinking has to do with your challenges.

0:51:52.180,0:51:56.400
When you say, "Ha, how will I get out of this mess now?", you are thinking.

0:51:56.400,0:51:59.060
"How will I sleep now?" - you are thinking.

0:51:59.060,0:52:05.040
"Oh, I don't know what is wrong." - you are thinking.

0:52:05.040,0:52:09.000
That thinking leads to depression.

0:52:09.000,0:52:14.740
When you are meditating, you can answer people, you can talk to people.

0:52:14.740,0:52:17.300
You can greet people while you are meditating.

0:52:17.300,0:52:18.780
Let me hear from my brother.

0:52:18.780,0:52:21.720
- You mean you are meditating now?
- Yes, sir.

0:52:21.720,0:52:24.020
- As you are talking to me?
- Yes, sir.

0:52:24.020,0:52:32.840
And when this thing becomes part of you, over the time, then your blood and fluids will cooperate.

0:52:32.840,0:52:37.620
Right now at the beginning, your blood will not cooperate.

0:52:37.620,0:52:41.560
You know, blood cooperates - when you move, the blood flows,

0:52:41.560,0:52:45.680
but right now, when you begin, your blood will not cooperate.

0:52:45.680,0:52:52.060
You will find it difficult - the beginning of everything is like that.

0:52:52.060,0:52:57.760
When you wanted to start crawling when you were a baby...

0:52:57.760,0:53:02.720
You were an embryo - see what you have become today.

0:53:02.720,0:53:05.140
This is why we give you faith bracelets.

0:53:05.140,0:53:08.180
Who has a faith bracelet here?

0:53:08.180,0:53:10.380
Oh yes - come on, bring your own.

0:53:10.380,0:53:15.760
This is why we have this.

0:53:15.760,0:53:20.700
It helps you to meditate.

0:53:20.700,0:53:29.800
Unlike religious people - when they have it, you see their mouth...

0:53:29.800,0:53:33.060
It is for meditation to reset your belief.

0:53:33.060,0:53:39.400
If you meditate, you can still be talking to people and be going on.

0:53:39.400,0:53:41.900
So, thank you very much - clap for my brother.

0:53:41.900,0:53:46.200
Anyone else there?

0:53:46.200,0:53:50.220
My brother here wants to tell us the way he will be filled today.

0:53:50.220,0:53:57.240
When you are filled with God's Word through meditation, it helps you to obey the Word,

0:53:57.240,0:54:04.500
because your heart will not occupy you; instead, you will occupy your heart.

0:54:04.500,0:54:06.720
Did you listen to that?

0:54:06.720,0:54:14.120
The advantage of this is that it will reset your belief, focus.

0:54:14.120,0:54:20.360
Many of us talk too much; we are lying.

0:54:20.360,0:54:25.080
This thing will reset your faith, your belief.

0:54:25.080,0:54:25.960
Thank you very much.

0:54:25.960,0:54:27.980
Who else?

0:54:27.980,0:54:32.440
The little girl here.

0:54:32.440,0:54:38.480
Are you in that business of meditation now?

0:54:38.480,0:54:42.080
Now, you know the meaning of meditation:

0:54:42.080,0:54:48.500
Speak to yourself in hymns, Psalms and spiritual songs.

0:54:48.500,0:54:52.760
Make melodies in your heart all the time.

0:54:52.760,0:54:57.520
Before you know it, you are filled.

0:54:57.520,0:55:00.680
This heart is the challenge you have.

0:55:00.680,0:55:03.980
Your heart is the one controlling you, directing you

0:55:03.980,0:55:06.220
but right now, it is time to take hold of your heart.

0:55:06.220,0:55:13.840
"No, my heart - you have been embarrassing me."

0:55:13.840,0:55:15.620
Emmanuel.

0:55:15.620,0:55:19.860
In order for you to be filled with the Spirit, you need to be grounded in the Word,

0:55:19.860,0:55:23.140
so that the Holy Spirit will have something to hold on to.

0:55:23.140,0:55:29.040
If you are not grounded in the Word, the Holy Spirit will not have anything to remind you of.

0:55:29.040,0:55:30.980
Did you listen to that?

0:55:30.980,0:55:36.740
In order to be filled, you have to be grounded in the Word.

0:55:36.740,0:55:41.680
You have to be sane in your heart.

0:55:41.680,0:55:49.080
If not, the Holy Spirit will have nothing to remind you of.

0:55:49.080,0:55:54.800
"Thou shalt not kill" from the Bible - He is the One telling us this.

0:55:54.800,0:55:55.900
So please, thank you.

0:55:55.900,0:55:57.980
Anyone else?

0:55:57.980,0:56:02.880
Give it to the sister there.

0:56:02.880,0:56:04.860
Emmanuel.

0:56:04.860,0:56:08.720
Since I know what the Holy Spirit means by...

0:56:08.720,0:56:12.100
Before, I used to be angry and aggressive to my six kids.

0:56:12.100,0:56:13.220
You used to be...?

0:56:13.220,0:56:16.120
Aggressive, angry.

0:56:16.120,0:56:21.180
This thing has given me heart attack, hypertension, blood pressure.

0:56:21.180,0:56:26.200
My daughter said, "Look, if you want to live long, you have to be calm".

0:56:26.200,0:56:30.300
Really, I remember the Holy Spirit working for me, since I started meditating.

0:56:30.300,0:56:34.480
I remember when daddy brought out this faith bracelet - "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:56:34.480,0:56:35.720
Let us see your...

0:56:35.720,0:56:38.140
Take more of me, give me more of You, Holy Spirit.

0:56:38.140,0:56:40.180
Thank you, clap for her.

0:56:40.180,0:56:42.300
Did you listen to that?

0:56:42.300,0:56:48.740
When this faith bracelet was given, the language followed - "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:56:48.740,0:56:58.500
I have given you another one today: "Locate me in Your mercy...

0:56:58.500,0:57:08.020
Locate me in Your favour, locate me in Your mercy...

0:57:08.020,0:57:09.700
Take more of me, give me more of You".

0:57:09.700,0:57:13.180
Even when I'm praying for you, you continue to do that meditation,

0:57:13.180,0:57:17.780
"Locate me in Your favour, locate me in Your mercy".

0:57:17.780,0:57:20.380
Thank you, my sister.

0:57:20.380,0:57:21.980
Anyone else?

0:57:21.980,0:57:24.380
OK, give it to my brother there.

0:57:24.380,0:57:27.840
Emmanuel.

0:57:27.840,0:57:31.880
It is my first time in The SCOAN.

0:57:31.880,0:57:37.420
I listen to Emmanuel TV all the time.

0:57:37.420,0:57:39.960
Emmanuel TV has changed my life.

0:57:39.960,0:57:44.820
I didn't read the Bible before, until I started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:57:44.820,0:57:50.540
When I started watching Emmanuel TV, I saw the man of God preaching,

0:57:50.540,0:57:58.280
giving advice that we should be meditating - "Give me more of You, God, take more of me".

0:57:58.280,0:58:00.860
I imbibed that caution.

0:58:00.860,0:58:05.320
I'm a clinical pharmacist; I have my own clinical pharmacy.

0:58:05.320,0:58:10.240
I counsel patients, I see them on a daily basis.

0:58:10.240,0:58:16.980
On this occasion, I was in my office attending to patients.

0:58:16.980,0:58:21.560
I had imbibed the caution of "Give me more of You, take more of me".

0:58:21.560,0:58:23.500
This time I was doing that.

0:58:23.500,0:58:31.380
I was attending to a patient and I was meditating, "Give me more of You, take more of me".

0:58:31.380,0:58:33.160
Behold!

0:58:33.160,0:58:36.860
The mother and the daughter.

0:58:36.860,0:58:40.740
After the mother had complained, the daughter followed.

0:58:40.740,0:58:51.320
While I was talking, I was meditating, "Give me more of You, take more of me, Lord..."

0:58:51.320,0:58:58.040
I then asked the girl, "How are you? What is your name?"

0:58:58.040,0:58:59.480
I said, "Shake me".

0:58:59.480,0:59:06.900
The moment I shook the hand of this girl, she said, "Leave me! Do you know me

0:59:06.900,0:59:11.280
Do you know who I am? You see me small. I'm a big woman".

0:59:11.280,0:59:15.800
The mother, sitting next to her, didn't know anything.

0:59:15.800,0:59:17.460
In fact, I was shocked.

0:59:17.460,0:59:23.280
I was looking, and I said, "Glory be to God. God of Prophet T.B. Joshua has taken me to this realm.

0:59:23.280,0:59:26.320
I want to go deeper to the other realm."

0:59:26.320,0:59:29.640
Did you listen to that?

0:59:29.640,0:59:34.300
You remember what I told you, that the prayer you used to offer -

0:59:34.300,0:59:38.760
all this while, you are wasting your time.

0:59:38.760,0:59:46.600
The prayer is all about heart, but your prayer is all about your mouth.

0:59:46.600,0:59:47.900
You are just wasting your time.

0:59:47.900,0:59:55.280
Each time I see people say, "In the name of Jesus...", I say, "Ooo - you are inviting an attack".

0:59:55.280,1:00:02.440
Will you reset yourself now and start this meditation - that is the prayer you need now.

1:00:02.440,1:00:06.540
As you are sitting, what is going on in your heart?

1:00:06.540,1:00:09.900
Ask your neighbour, "What is going on in your heart?

1:00:09.900,1:00:12.800
Have you taken hold of your heart?

1:00:12.800,1:00:16.040
Are you in charge?

1:00:16.040,1:00:24.620
Speak to yourself in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.

1:00:24.620,1:00:29.020
Make melodies in your heart."

1:00:29.020,1:00:33.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

1:00:33.920,1:00:36.420
You see what is happening now.

1:00:36.420,1:00:41.880
He was meditating in his heart, no one knew what he was saying in his heart,

1:00:41.880,1:00:51.220
but mere stretching hand to the little one, "Leave me! I'm this" - she started confessing.

1:00:51.220,1:00:54.840
You keep deceiving yourself - you say you are praying.

1:00:54.840,1:00:57.400
Those who are not supposed to pray for you are praying for you;

1:00:57.400,1:01:01.540
you are better than them but they are praying for you.

1:01:01.540,1:01:05.600
Prayer has become a culture, a tradition.

1:01:05.600,1:01:13.200
Prayer is not a tradition, it’s as it should be by divine will.

1:01:13.200,1:01:16.500
You wake up in the morning, you say, "Let's pray".

1:01:16.500,1:01:23.440
Instead of counselling your family first, "Hello. Good morning. What has happened?

1:01:23.440,1:01:28.000
What happened yesterday? I corrected you yesterday. I told you not to do this.

1:01:28.000,1:01:35.140
I hope you have learnt your lesson from it. OK. What is going on in your school. Please, come on.

1:01:35.140,1:01:40.100
The way you look is not right, you keep malice. Please, be cheerful as a Christian.

1:01:40.100,1:01:42.280
Do you have any pain? What is worrying you?"

1:01:42.280,1:01:45.560
These are counsels you need to give to your family.

1:01:45.560,1:01:52.060
After that counselling you will then tell them about Jesus, the Holy Spirit I'm talking about now.

1:01:52.060,1:01:58.400
"This is what the Bible says and what Prophet T.B. Joshua also mentioned last Sunday -

1:01:58.400,1:02:03.800
You have to speak to yourself with all your heart; speak to yourself – that is the biggest prayer."

1:02:03.800,1:02:07.160
Every other prayer is small.

1:02:07.160,1:02:13.260
The biggest prayer is to speak to your heart, take hold of your heart,

1:02:13.260,1:02:21.660
speak to yourself in Psalms, in hymns, make melodies while you are walking, sleeping, all the time.

1:02:21.660,1:02:29.720
Tthat is the greatest prayer that defeats the enemy, that will help you, that will protect you.

1:02:29.720,1:02:30.940
That is the prayer!

1:02:30.940,1:02:48.620
The one you make today waking up and saying, "In Jesus' name, be rebuked!" - whom are you talking to?

1:02:48.620,1:02:50.760
You are wasting your time.

1:02:50.760,1:02:53.240
You have seen enough of this prayer.

1:02:53.240,1:02:58.700
You can see that nothing...

1:02:58.700,1:03:03.080
Thank you, brother. Clap for him.

What is the best prayer to God?

1:03:09.640,1:03:10.860
Can somebody?

1:03:10.860,1:03:12.380
Give it to my brother.

1:03:12.380,1:03:17.180
The best prayer.

1:03:17.180,1:03:19.260
Emmanuel.

1:03:19.260,1:03:23.080
The best prayer is the prayer that comes from the heart.

1:03:23.080,1:03:25.040
How can the prayer come from the heart?

1:03:25.040,1:03:30.760
When you are meditating on the Word of God in your heart, and your heart is connected with God,

1:03:30.760,1:03:34.580
that is the best prayer ever.

1:03:34.580,1:03:35.880
I have an example.

1:03:35.880,1:03:41.480
One day, when I was in the car, I was meditating on the Word of God.

1:03:41.480,1:03:46.980
I was in front of the vehicle between two people; the driver and the other one.

1:03:46.980,1:03:51.520
Whilst I was meditating on the Word of God, the driver shouted, "Hey!"

1:03:51.520,1:03:53.440
Then I shouted, "Jesus!"

1:03:53.440,1:03:56.820
Then I found myself outside, standing on my feet.

1:03:56.820,1:04:04.660
I don't know how I got there - I was standing outside, while the other people had broken bones.

1:04:04.660,1:04:08.100
They stayed in the car, they couldn't come out, the car somersaulted 3 times.

1:04:08.100,1:04:14.020
I thank God I shouted "Jesus!" before it happened - and I was standing outside.

1:04:14.020,1:04:19.760
But our people today shout "Jesus" after it happened.

1:04:19.760,1:04:26.660
I know you.

1:04:26.660,1:04:36.680
You shout "Jesus" after nightmare, trouble.

1:04:36.680,1:04:37.860
I want to leave you.

1:04:37.860,1:04:42.120
Once again - please, be filled.

1:04:42.120,1:04:50.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

1:04:50.180,1:04:54.640
I want to have your report; send me an e-mail and let me follow it up.

1:04:54.640,1:04:57.520
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

1:04:57.520,1:05:07.320
This Bible you are carrying without the Holy Spirit is literature.

1:05:07.320,1:05:13.280
This Bible you are carrying without the Holy Spirit is history.

1:05:13.280,1:05:23.660
It’s not possible for anyone to obey the Word of God without the Holy Spirit.

1:05:23.660,1:05:27.880
Not that you will not obey when you say, "Thou shalt not lie".

1:05:27.880,1:05:36.720
Without the Holy Spirit you say, "I will not lie again. T.B. Joshua said in his message we should not lie".

1:05:36.720,1:05:42.500
You will keep that for one day, two days, three days, four days;

1:05:42.500,1:05:47.860
on the fifth day you will become the greatest liar.

1:05:47.860,1:05:51.100
You will explode.

1:05:51.100,1:05:53.400
That is how far you can go.

1:05:53.400,1:05:57.720
But with God all things are possible.

1:05:57.720,1:06:04.500
But how far you can go; you keep saying "Thou shalt not lie" -

1:06:04.500,1:06:07.100
on the first day you will be conscious of yourself;

1:06:07.100,1:06:12.620
you want to lie but you are conscious of yourself, "The Bible says we should not lie".

1:06:12.620,1:06:15.020
The second day...

1:06:15.020,1:06:17.120
The third day...

1:06:17.120,1:06:20.500
What of you, drunkard?

1:06:20.500,1:06:26.060
You stop today, stop for five days...

1:06:26.060,1:06:32.340
In the dream they will give you to drink; you will finish 10 bottles of beer.

1:06:32.340,1:06:37.480
By the time you have taken it so much in your dream, you will wake up.

1:06:37.480,1:06:43.120
You are going to the beer parlour to drink.

1:06:43.120,1:06:50.080
Without the Holy Spirit, no one can obey the written Word of God.

1:06:50.080,1:06:51.400
Tell your neighbour.

1:06:51.400,1:06:55.880
Without the Holy Spirit, no one can obey the written Word of God.

1:06:55.880,1:06:58.480
Thank you.
