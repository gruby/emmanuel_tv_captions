0:00:00.040,0:00:05.340
Prophet T.B. Joshua stands in the authority and power of the name of Jesus Christ

0:00:05.340,0:00:10.120
as he sets the people free from bondage with a touch or a simple look from God

0:00:10.120,0:00:12.960
that exposes the darkness hidden inside them.

0:00:12.960,0:00:16.660
There is no hiding place for demons when Jesus is on the scene.

0:00:16.660,0:00:19.860
Let us hear from the evil spirit inside this woman.

0:00:19.860,0:00:25.080
I gave her the spirit of prostitution.

0:00:25.080,0:00:29.360
I want to destroy her life with the spirit of prostitution.

0:00:29.360,0:00:36.700
I sleep with between 10 to 30 men - it depends.

0:00:36.700,0:00:37.980
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:37.980,0:00:39.640
How did you enter her?

0:00:39.640,0:00:42.600
After she had finished with her school.

0:00:42.600,0:00:46.700
Knowing that the demon has been chained by the power of God.

0:00:46.700,0:00:49.540
Thank You, Jesus!

0:00:49.540,0:00:53.940
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:00:53.940,0:00:58.340
My name is Nkechi Uwaifo. I am from Delta state.

0:00:58.340,0:01:01.760
The person beside me here is my mother.

0:01:01.760,0:01:06.200
The next person here is my elder 
sister; her name is Justina.

0:01:06.200,0:01:10.260
The one near me is Faith, and the other one is Angela.

0:01:10.260,0:01:12.860
They are all my elder sisters.

0:01:12.860,0:01:17.160
What brought me to The SCOAN was the spirit of prostitution.

0:01:17.160,0:01:22.880
When I was in school, somebody came to deceive us.

0:01:22.880,0:01:26.240
I wanted to write my exams in SS3 (Senior Secondary School).

0:01:26.240,0:01:35.540
Somebody came and deceived us 
that she wanted to take us to La Cote d' Ivoire.

0:01:35.540,0:01:37.300
There were 10 of us.

0:01:37.300,0:01:38.920
How old were you at that time?

0:01:38.920,0:01:41.080
By that time I was thirteen years.

0:01:41.080,0:01:42.600
And you were in what class?

0:01:42.640,0:01:45.160
I was going to a SS3 (Senior Secondary School).

0:01:45.160,0:01:48.760
So the person came and told us that she wanted to take us to La Cote d'Ivoire

0:01:48.760,0:01:52.640
and that there, we would continue our schooling.

0:01:52.640,0:01:58.280
When we got to La Cote d'Ivoire, she introduced us into prostitution.

0:01:58.280,0:02:07.360
She didn't tell us when we were in Nigeria hat she was taking us there to do prostitution.

0:02:07.360,0:02:14.920
When we got to La Cote d'Ivoire, she told us that we would be doing prostitution.

0:02:14.920,0:02:20.400
We had to pay the woman 400,000 CFA.

0:02:20.400,0:02:24.720
I told her that she did not tell us all these things when we were in Nigeria.

0:02:24.720,0:02:26.460
She said that we didn't have sense;

0:02:26.460,0:02:31.220
that didn't we see that many people were making money and building houses everywhere

0:02:31.220,0:02:35.080
and that we didn't want to be millionaires?

0:02:35.080,0:02:40.860
Then, we said we would do it because we didn't have a choice.

0:02:40.860,0:02:44.840
From there, the woman took us to the madam.

0:02:44.840,0:02:51.680
The madam called us and talked to us that we should do it and that she too was doing it.

0:02:51.680,0:02:57.740
She said that she paid the person who brought her to La Cote d'Ivoire 400,000 CFA.

0:02:57.740,0:03:04.260
and that we were going to pay the same amount before we would be free and on our own.

0:03:04.260,0:03:10.260
When she explained it to us like that, we said that we would do it.

0:03:10.260,0:03:16.680
When we started doing it in La Cote d'Ivoire, we started paying her the money.

0:03:16.680,0:03:21.540
I took four months to pay her the 400,000 CFA.

0:03:21.540,0:03:28.760
Sometimes, I slept with 10 to 20 men; it depended on when there were customers.

0:03:28.760,0:03:33.540
After that, she said that we should have our own place and she would rent a place for us.

0:03:33.540,0:03:38.760
We too should have our own place to do our own thing and begin to gather money

0:03:38.760,0:03:44.720
to start what we would be doing in life.

0:03:44.780,0:03:47.880
When she explained this to us, we told her no problem.

0:03:47.880,0:03:50.960
She rented a place for us and we started doing our own.

0:03:50.960,0:03:54.160
Then, we started gathering our own money.

0:03:54.160,0:04:02.920
For more than 8 years, I did not hear anything from my family.

0:04:02.920,0:04:06.060
Your family members were not aware that you had travelled?

0:04:06.060,0:04:06.760
Yes.

0:04:06.760,0:04:07.560
You didn't tell anyone?

0:04:07.560,0:04:09.280
No, I didn't tell them.

0:04:09.280,0:04:14.920
I went to the person that brought me to La Cote d'Ivoire that I wanted to hear from my family.

0:04:14.920,0:04:18.120
He said that I should not worry and that he would get the number
for me.

0:04:18.120,0:04:25.020
He said that I should call my family but I should not tell them what I was doing in La Cote d'Ivoire.

0:04:25.020,0:04:28.720
He told me that I should lie to my family.

0:04:28.720,0:04:33.100
I agreed that I would speak to my family like that because they didn't know what I was doing.

0:04:33.100,0:04:38.000
I called my mother and she said that they had been looking for me for so many years.

0:04:38.000,0:04:42.800
When I told her I was in La Cote d'Ivoire, she asked me what I was doing there.

0:04:42.800,0:04:47.320
I told her that I was learning how to plait hair.

0:04:47.320,0:04:53.120
Another day, when I called them, they would ask if I was still plaiting hair in La Cote d'Ivoire.

0:04:53.120,0:04:55.300
I would say yes but I was lying to them.

0:04:55.300,0:05:00.420
Sometime later, they would call me again and I would lie to them that I was sewing.

0:05:00.420,0:05:04.600
I continued lying to them, telling them different types of stories.

0:05:04.600,0:05:08.720
So for how many years did you say your family did not see you?

0:05:08.720,0:05:11.100
For eight years.

0:05:11.100,0:05:13.240
You were in La Cote d'Ivoire doing the work of prostitution?

0:05:13.240,0:05:13.860
Yes!

0:05:13.860,0:05:16.120
Okay, so what happened after that?

0:05:16.120,0:05:24.780
When I gathered my money, I went to Morocco; I said I wanted to travel to Spain

0:05:24.780,0:05:34.660
On my way to Spain, I got deported from Morocco to Mali.

0:05:34.660,0:05:44.540
In Mali, I started doing prostitution again to gather money to get to Spain.

0:05:44.540,0:05:48.500
When I had gathered enough money, I tried to get to Spain again.

0:05:48.500,0:05:52.540
But on my way to Spain, they deported me again; this made it two times now.

0:05:52.540,0:05:55.840
I came back to La Cote d'Ivoire again.

0:05:55.840,0:05:58.440
What were you planning to do to Spain?

0:05:58.440,0:06:01.460
It was the same prostitution.

0:06:01.460,0:06:05.100
Okay, so now you were deported twice from Spain back to La Cote d'Ivoire?

0:06:05.100,0:06:05.740
Yes.

0:06:05.740,0:06:07.200
So what happened after that?

0:06:07.200,0:06:10.940
I met the father of my child.

0:06:10.940,0:06:13.380
This child here - Blessing.

0:06:13.380,0:06:17.940
He told me that he liked me and he wanted to marry me.

0:06:17.940,0:06:22.160
I said, okay, there was no problem and we started befriending each other.

0:06:22.160,0:06:24.500
Then, I got pregnant.

0:06:24.500,0:06:29.640
He told me that since for eight years, I had not seen my family,

0:06:29.640,0:06:32.940
he would like to follow me to go and see them.

0:06:32.940,0:06:40.860
From there, he started seeing my family and introduced himself as the father of my pregnancy

0:06:40.860,0:06:47.120
and that he wanted to marry me.

0:06:47.120,0:06:51.300
We then travelled to Warri in Delta State to his mother's place; he introduced me to his mother.

0:06:51.300,0:06:54.920
His mother told me that I should stay in her place to deliver my baby.

0:06:54.920,0:06:56.980
I said, "No problem, Mama. I will stay".

0:06:56.980,0:07:00.820
I told her that I didn't have any money to do any business in Nigeria.

0:07:00.820,0:07:05.400
She said that I shouldn't worry and that her son would send money for me.

0:07:05.400,0:07:13.460
I told her that I had money in the bank account of the father of my child.

0:07:13.460,0:07:16.440
I had money with him in his account.

0:07:16.440,0:07:21.320
I said that she should let him send the money to me for me to start business in Nigeria

0:07:21.320,0:07:25.580
as I didn't want to return to La Cote d' Ivoire anymore; I was tired.

0:07:25.580,0:07:31.280
The father of this child told me that I should not worry and that the money that was in the bank,

0:07:31.280,0:07:36.540
that the bank wanted to borrow the money and put interest on it for me

0:07:36.540,0:07:41.700
so that at the end of the year, the bank would gather all the money together for me.

0:07:41.700,0:07:47.720
I had gathered 1 million CFA by that time in La Cote d' Ivoire.

0:07:47.720,0:07:50.740
Out of the work of prostitution, you were able to gather that money?

0:07:50.740,0:07:51.520
Yes,

0:07:51.520,0:07:55.280
{So eventually, what now happened with the money?

0:07:55.280,0:08:01.040
The man was just telling me stories and until today, I have not seen the money.

0:08:01.040,0:08:03.980
I had to forget about the money.

0:08:03.980,0:08:06.020
So you mean he duped you?

0:08:06.020,0:08:07.320
Yes.

0:08:07.320,0:08:12.440
I just thought that as he had promised that he wanted to marry me, no problem.

0:08:12.440,0:08:15.960
I knew that through that promise he made, if he had money,

0:08:15.960,0:08:19.900
he would give me the money that was in his account back.

0:08:19.900,0:08:24.920
Then, I was pregnant with this girl.

0:08:24.920,0:08:27.940
At that time, I was still doing prostitution.

0:08:27.940,0:08:36.860
After having this child, I stopped doing prostitution.

0:08:36.860,0:08:43.840
After eight years, when you came back home, did your family accept you ?

0:08:43.840,0:08:49.840
Yes, they accepted me but I still went back to the father of my child.

0:08:49.840,0:08:54.460
I told them that I was going to Warri to go and deliver my child.

0:08:54.460,0:08:56.720
From there, after you delivered your child, what happened?

0:08:56.720,0:08:59.720
I delivered twins but they did not live.

0:08:59.720,0:09:00.580
Before this one?

0:09:00.580,0:09:01.380
Yes.

0:09:01.380,0:09:06.460
Then, he called me and said that I should come back to La Cote d' Ivoire.

0:09:06.460,0:09:11.880
I didn't know that he was just deceiving me to use my money.

0:09:11.880,0:09:14.800
So you still found yourself back to La Cote d' Ivoire?

0:09:14.800,0:09:15.620
Yes

0:09:15.620,0:09:16.540
Doing what?

0:09:16.540,0:09:19.200
I was doing the same prostitution.

0:09:19.200,0:09:28.540
When this child was one year old, I came back to Nigeria for her to know my family.

0:09:28.540,0:09:32.320
My family did not know about this child.

0:09:32.320,0:09:36.880
Since I came back with this child, I did not go back to La Cote d' Ivoire.

0:09:36.880,0:09:42.700
When I wanted to go back again, after my family had seen my child,

0:09:42.700,0:09:45.680
I went to meet the father of this child.

0:09:45.680,0:09:51.740
I said, "See what is happening; I don't have money for me to start again in Nigeria.

0:09:51.740,0:09:54.560
Nobody wants to help me".

0:09:54.560,0:09:57.500
Okay. Tell us how you eventually came here.

0:09:57.500,0:10:03.300
What happened? How did you come to The SCOAN? Who brought you here?

0:10:03.300,0:10:07.240
It was my mother who told me that I should come here for deliverance.

0:10:07.240,0:10:09.720
Okay, after eight years you went back again?

0:10:09.720,0:10:10.220
Yes,

0:10:10.220,0:10:14.420
So altogether, how many years were you doing this work?

0:10:14.420,0:10:17.060
That is 12 years.

0:10:17.060,0:10:17.800
Twelve years?

0:10:17.800,0:10:18.420
Yes.

0:10:18.420,0:10:21.900
For this 12 years, can you give an account of anything you acquired -

0:10:21.900,0:10:26.420
maybe money, property, car, house or anything that you were able to get

0:10:26.420,0:10:27.920
as a result of this work of prostitution.

0:10:27.920,0:10:30.760
Nothing!

0:10:30.760,0:10:31.500
Wow.

0:10:31.500,0:10:36.080
Both fathers of these children are not alive; I am the one taking care of these children.

0:10:36.080,0:10:40.260
because I still went back and struggled to have money to train these children

0:10:40.260,0:10:42.840
through doing prostitution here in Nigeria also.

0:10:42.840,0:10:46.480
Okay, can you now tell us how you came to The SCOAN.

0:10:46.480,0:10:50.320
It was my mother who introduced me to The SCOAN, that I should come for deliverance.

0:10:50.320,0:10:52.400
Okay, so when you came, what happened?

0:10:52.400,0:10:56.480
When I came that Monday, the man of God prayed for me.

0:10:56.480,0:10:59.620
When the man of God prayed for me, I just fell down.

0:10:59.620,0:11:08.840
The spirit inside me began to manifest that it wanted to make my life useless.

0:11:08.840,0:11:15.580
It confessed that it was the spirit of prostitution.

0:11:15.580,0:11:22.660
Then, he delivered me. Now, I am free and I thank God that I am free!

0:11:22.660,0:11:24.640
I am not going back again.

0:11:24.640,0:11:33.480
That night the man of God prayed for me, in a dream, I felt something come out

0:11:33.480,0:11:37.280
of the back of my head; I thought it was a rat.

0:11:37.280,0:11:40.960
I was surprised but I thought that a rat could not enter this house.

0:11:40.960,0:11:49.960
I slept and in another dream, I saw somebody with a giant hand touch me and I fell down.

0:11:49.960,0:11:53.220
That night, I woke up and started 
praying.

0:11:53.220,0:11:58.180
I said, "God, this deliverance that I 
have been waiting for, I have received it".

0:11:58.180,0:12:00.940
So that was before the man of God prayed for you?

0:12:00.940,0:12:05.680
The day the man of God touched me was the day that I had that dream.

0:12:05.680,0:12:07.380
Since after that time, can you tell us what happened.

0:12:07.380,0:12:09.120
I still had another dream.

0:12:09.120,0:12:13.940
I saw myself preaching to people who were doing prostitution.

0:12:13.940,0:12:18.680
I told them that they should not do 
this work.

0:12:18.680,0:12:25.940
Leave that life, work and face God. God has solution.

0:12:25.940,0:12:32.380
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:32.380,0:12:37.320
So you could not imagine yourself, seeing yourself in the dream, preaching to people

0:12:37.320,0:12:40.940
who are doing the same work you were doing for 12 years - the work of prostitution.

0:12:40.940,0:12:41.840
Yes!

0:12:41.840,0:12:46.660
Apart from that, tell us: What are the changes you have noticed after your deliverance?

0:12:46.660,0:12:51.040
Do you still have the urge to go out and meet men, to run away from home, to travel out?

0:12:51.040,0:12:53.740
Do you still have such urge?

0:12:53.740,0:12:58.720
No. Now, if I sleep, I will sleep
 like a baby and wake up.

0:12:58.720,0:13:05.520
I now dream good dreams for my life, even seeing myself praying but before, I did not pray.

0:13:05.520,0:13:08.800
If I said that I would pray, I would just go and sleep.

0:13:08.800,0:13:14.600
Sometimes, people would come to sleep with me; I'd be doing prostitution in the dream

0:13:14.600,0:13:19.040
but since the man of God delivered me, I have not seen that kind of thing again.

0:13:19.040,0:13:24.880
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the king of glory!

0:13:24.880,0:13:28.140
We thank God Almighty for your life.

0:13:28.140,0:13:33.120
One more thing we would like to hear from you because people are listening to you,

0:13:33.120,0:13:35.640
they are learning from what you are saying.

0:13:35.640,0:13:42.760
Many people would have a reason for going out into such a job as prostitution -

0:13:42.760,0:13:45.880
maybe because of msltreatment from their parents, their family.

0:13:45.880,0:13:51.440
Was there any maltreatment from your family before you decided to travel out for this job?

0:13:51.440,0:13:53.520
Yes.

0:13:53.520,0:14:01.060
Back when I was small, I thought that my sisters and mother did not like me.

0:14:01.060,0:14:04.080
Sometimes, I thought that they hated me.

0:14:04.080,0:14:14.380
That was why when I went to Agbor, that spirit that influenced me to travel was able to enter me.

0:14:14.380,0:14:20.460
Okay. Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:14:20.460,0:14:24.620
My name is Grace Uwaifo. I am from Delta State.

0:14:24.620,0:14:30.500
She is my daughter Nkechi; the rest are her elder sisters.

0:14:30.500,0:14:32.820
I thank God for her life.

0:14:32.820,0:14:36.260
Two weeks ago, when she came here, she received her deliverance.

0:14:36.260,0:14:43.400
Before then, she always cried, telling me she wanted to go back to La Cote d'Ivoire.

0:14:43.400,0:14:51.560
One day, when I came home, she would have killed herself or gone back to La Cote d'Ivoire.

0:14:51.560,0:14:55.860
I would tell her, "No. One day God will deliver you from this spirit".

0:14:55.860,0:14:58.340
because I knew that it was not ordinary.

0:14:58.340,0:15:04.280
She came to collect money for WECC and NECO exams.

0:15:04.280,0:15:08.540
She used the money to travel out and 
for eight years, nobody heard about her.

0:15:08.540,0:15:09.780
It was eight years.

0:15:09.780,0:15:15.620
Then, she came and went back for four years before she came back with this baby.

0:15:15.620,0:15:20.280
Okay. We thank God Almighty. So how do you feel now, seeing that your daughter is delivered?

0:15:20.280,0:15:23.160
I thank God for her deliverance. I am very happy.

0:15:23.160,0:15:28.400
Can we hear from one of the sisters.

0:15:28.400,0:15:29.760
Please tell us your name.

0:15:29.760,0:15:34.160
My name is Justina. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.

0:15:34.160,0:15:37.320
As a young child, I was sent on to further my education,

0:15:37.320,0:15:42.100
so no one was there to watch after her.

0:15:42.100,0:15:50.840
Coming across the wrong set of people was how she just began to waste her years.

0:15:50.840,0:15:56.300
Now, I believe that the past is over and the best is yet to come for her.

0:15:56.300,0:15:58.580
Thank you. Shall we clap for Jesus Christ.

My name is Faith Okonkwo.

0:16:06.000,0:16:10.120
I thank God for my life and for what He has done in my sister's life.

0:16:10.120,0:16:13.500
I thank God that she came back and was delivered.

0:16:13.500,0:16:16.060
I give God the glory; I give God the honour.

0:16:16.060,0:16:18.040
For how many years did you not seen her?

0:16:18.040,0:16:19.940
For 12 years.

0:16:19.940,0:16:21.120
Glory be to God.

0:16:21.120,0:16:23.720
My name is  Gbadebo Angela.

0:16:23.720,0:16:27.540
I'm the elder sister to Nkechi.

0:16:27.540,0:16:32.800
I want to use this medium to appreciate God for deilvering my sister,

0:16:32.800,0:16:38.880
for bringing my sister safely back and alive after going astray.

0:16:38.880,0:16:47.520
I want to use this medium to advise the youth, most especially the young girls

0:16:47.520,0:16:50.220
that they should be content with what they have.

0:16:50.220,0:16:52.620
They should appreciate their families.

0:16:52.620,0:17:00.400
They should hold on to the Word of God and believe that their present condition

0:17:00.400,0:17:06.200
is not the final stage of their life; the best is yet to come.

0:17:06.200,0:17:11.420
If we pray, hold on to God and work hard, we will definitely get to where we want to go.

0:17:11.420,0:17:13.800
Amen. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Miss Nkechi Uwaifo & Family
Deliverance Testimony

0:17:16.700,0:17:22.020
My advice for the viewers, most especially to the young girls

0:17:22.020,0:17:24.520
and those who are doing this prostitution,

0:17:24.520,0:17:30.820
let them run to God who delivered me, for them to have their own deliverance.

0:17:30.820,0:17:34.640
That work is not a good work.

0:17:34.640,0:17:37.560
Thank you. Let us clap for Jesus Christ.

0:17:37.560,0:17:41.960
A word is enough for the wise, so we thank God Almighty for your life once again.

0:17:41.960,0:17:47.640
Now that you are delivered, we want to 
encourage you to stay true to our Lord Jesus Christ,

0:17:47.640,0:17:54.460
to embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change.

0:17:54.460,0:17:59.320
Now the spirit of prostitution has been cast out, you need to build the character of God

0:17:59.320,0:18:02.600
and this can only happen by making the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:18:02.600,0:18:05.280
We pray that the Lord Almighty will give you the grace

0:18:05.280,0:18:08.480
to make the Word of God the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.

0:18:08.480,0:18:16.220
We believe that this deliverance will bring total deliverance to the entire family, in Jesus' name.

0:18:16.220,0:18:18.520
Thank You, Jesus. Let us clap for Jesus one more time.

After the service, the Emmanuel TV team met up with Nkechi Uwaifo and her family once again

0:18:27.740,0:18:33.980
to hear their thoughts on the next step for the family in the light of her wonderful deliverance.

0:18:33.980,0:18:37.740
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:18:37.740,0:18:40.840
Emmanuel, viewers! God is with us!

0:18:40.840,0:18:45.560
We thank God for everything that the Lord God Almighty has done in this service today.

0:18:45.560,0:18:51.260
In the course of the service today, while the testimonies were going on,

0:18:51.260,0:18:57.020
we saw our sister here who came with her family members to share the testimony

0:18:57.020,0:19:00.700
of her deliverance from her past life of prostitution.

0:19:00.700,0:19:07.100
Today, she's a new person in Christ Jesus and she's here with her family right now

0:19:07.100,0:19:13.180
to say what is the next plan after her 
deliverance and her testimony today.

0:19:13.180,0:19:16.540
So sister, once again, can you tell us your name and of those who are standing with you.

0:19:16.540,0:19:18.260
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:19:18.260,0:19:21.700
My name is Nkechi Uwaifo from Delta State.

0:19:21.700,0:19:28.820
These are my elder sisters and my mother.

0:19:28.820,0:19:33.260
I thank God for what He has done for me,

0:19:33.260,0:19:42.080
using the man of God to deliver me from my past life of prostitution.

0:19:42.080,0:19:47.900
I pray to Almighty God that I will never go back to my past life again.

0:19:47.900,0:19:52.540
I will serve God in truth and in spirit.

0:19:52.540,0:19:56.100
We thank God Almighty for everything. So you mean, now that you are delivered

0:19:56.100,0:19:59.680
and you have shared the testimony of your deliverance,

0:19:59.680,0:20:06.260
you're going back to start a new life and not going back to your old way of life, is that right?

0:20:06.260,0:20:09.260
Yes, I promise God.

0:20:09.260,0:20:12.520
Let us also hear from members of your family

0:20:12.520,0:20:16.360
because we believe now that they have accepted you back,

0:20:16.360,0:20:20.520
they also understand that they have a role to play

0:20:20.520,0:20:22.680
to make sure that this deliverance is maintained.

0:20:22.680,0:20:24.340
So sister, once again tell us your name.

0:20:24.340,0:20:26.500
My name is Justina

0:20:26.500,0:20:27.720
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:20:27.720,0:20:32.460
I want to thank God for what happened today in the life of my sister.

0:20:32.460,0:20:34.920
I give God all the glory.

0:20:34.920,0:20:39.860
We promise to support her in any way we can.

0:20:39.860,0:20:45.920
My husband and I have decided to take care of the little girl

0:20:45.920,0:20:49.220
so that Nkechi can start her life all over again.

0:20:49.220,0:20:55.580
I will support her in any way I can so that she can get her life back.

0:20:55.580,0:21:01.220
Everyone makes mistakes; we believe she has made a mistake and has learnt from it.

0:21:01.220,0:21:07.680
She is going to start her life afresh and I know God has plans for her.

0:21:07.680,0:21:13.660
Every one of us will contribute in trying to see that she gets back on her feet.

0:21:13.660,0:21:15.660
Thank you very much.

0:21:15.660,0:21:20.440
We thank God Almighty. That is the love that our Lord Jesus Christ has been preaching

0:21:20.440,0:21:28.640
that we should learn to forgive one another and also to help one another's weakness.

0:21:28.640,0:21:32.580
Okay. Our dear sister, now that your past is over

0:21:32.580,0:21:39.660
and you have shared your testimony today before the congregation,

0:21:39.660,0:21:47.700
the anointed man of God, together with the Emmanuel TV partners, wants to support you

0:21:47.700,0:21:51.240
so that you can start a new life.

0:21:51.240,0:21:55.700
That is, choose whatever business you want to go into

0:21:55.700,0:22:03.260
so that you will not have any cause to remember and go back to your old way of life of prostitution.

0:22:03.260,0:22:08.080
In view of this, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, together with the Emmanuel TV partners,

0:22:08.080,0:22:15.360
has sent this 200,000 Naira for you to start something doing and take care of yourself.

0:22:15.360,0:22:19.700
We believe that God Almighty will continue the supply.

0:22:19.700,0:22:24.720
Also in addition, we have 'The Mirror' book and this is also to help you

0:22:24.720,0:22:27.780
to maintain the deliverance you have received.

0:22:27.780,0:22:33.600
That is the Word of God that is authored by the anointed man of God himself, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:33.600,0:22:38.880
I thank God for what He has done for using the man of God

0:22:38.880,0:22:42.300
to give me this opportunity to start a new life.

0:22:42.300,0:22:45.780
I pray to Almighty God that in my next visit here,

0:22:45.780,0:22:54.380
I am going to testify of glory and
honour for all that God has done for me, in Jesus' name.

0:22:54.380,0:23:00.100
I thank you, Man of God, for what you have done; you will never lack in your life or your family.

0:23:00.100,0:23:03.300
Long life will be your portion, in Jesus' name!

0:23:03.300,0:23:05.580
Thank you to the Emmanuel TV partners.

0:23:05.580,0:23:09.820
I pray to Almighty God: May God guide the Emmanuel TV partners,

0:23:09.820,0:23:12.820
long life and prosperity, in Jesus' name.

0:23:12.820,0:23:18.240
I want to say a very big thank you to the great man of God and Emmanuel TV partners.

0:23:18.240,0:23:23.440
I want to thank you for your love and support, both morally and financially.

0:23:23.440,0:23:28.320
I pray the good Lord will attend to every one of our needs, in Jesus' name.

0:23:28.320,0:23:30.280
I thank God. My children have said it all.

0:23:30.280,0:23:36.260
I thank God, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners.

0:23:36.260,0:23:39.040
I thank them; may God continue to bless them

0:23:39.040,0:23:43.260
I pray for more grace for the man of God - more grace, anointing

0:23:43.260,0:23:46.480
and strength to continue his work.

0:23:46.480,0:23:48.740
God bless the man of God.

0:23:48.740,0:23:51.740
I want to say I thank God for what 
He has done in my sister's life.

0:23:51.740,0:23:53.500
We give all the glory, we give all the honour to God.

0:23:53.500,0:23:55.240
Father, we thank you.

0:23:55.240,0:24:00.360
May your name be glorified, in Jesus' name. Amen.

0:24:00.360,0:24:04.920
I will support her in any way, in the name of Jesus.

0:24:04.920,0:24:08.960
I am really grateful for a day like this.

0:24:08.960,0:24:13.680
I have prayed for a day like this and I thank God that it came to pass.

0:24:13.680,0:24:19.320
I want to use this medium to thank the Emmanuel TV partners.

0:24:19.320,0:24:25.040
For Prophet T.B. Joshua, I pray for more anointing upon his life.

0:24:25.040,0:24:28.960
I pray for strength to carry on the work of the Lord

0:24:28.960,0:24:33.840
and I pray that God will strengthen and protect him.

0:24:33.840,0:24:36.820
God will protect Emmanuel TV partners.

0:24:36.820,0:24:43.300
Whatsoever be their hearts' desires all over the world, I pray that God will grant them.

0:24:43.300,0:24:48.860
Wherever this money has come from, the source will never run dry in Jesus' name.

0:24:48.860,0:24:56.360
For my sister, I pray that God will sustain her, maintain this deliverance - it shall be permanent,

0:24:56.360,0:24:59.700
Every power that wants to take her back to her past

0:24:59.700,0:25:03.080
is hereby condemned today, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:25:03.080,0:25:11.700
I pray I will support her in every way I can, for her to be saved forever, in Jesus' name.

0:25:11.700,0:25:13.260
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:25:13.260,0:25:16.400
Thank you very much.

0:25:16.400,0:25:24.160
Now that it is all over, we want to see that love being well expressed.

0:25:24.160,0:25:29.940
With what God has blessed her with, very soon, we believe that our sister is coming back

0:25:29.940,0:25:34.160
to share a testimony of the breakthrough that will come out

0:25:34.160,0:25:39.100
of this wonderful gesture she has received today, in Jesus' name.

0:25:39.100,0:25:39.720
Amen.
