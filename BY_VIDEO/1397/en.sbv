Man of God, help me, I have cancer.

0:00:02.260,0:00:04.640
I have taken one but I have to take one more.

0:00:04.640,0:00:07.660
Man of God, please help my husband. He has cancer.

0:00:07.660,0:00:13.140
He has taken one; it is remaining one and the doctors said it is fifty – fifty.

0:00:13.140,0:00:16.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mr Grytli.

0:00:16.060,0:00:19.240
This is prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:00:19.240,0:00:22.480
Watch as this man moves against his will,

0:00:22.480,0:00:30.280
there is a force busy at work setting him free, in the mighty, all-powerful name of Jesus Christ.

Good Morning, Church!

0:00:50.940,0:00:53.600
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

My name is Geir Grytli, I am from Norway.

0:00:57.300,0:01:01.800
The woman beside me is my lovely wife - Princess.

0:01:01.800,0:01:06.200
In 2016 I got cancer in my thyroids.

0:01:06.200,0:01:11.900
There was a lot of pain and I couldn't do anything.

0:01:11.900,0:01:17.600
We were watching Emmanuel TV all the time because operation is not a solution.

0:01:17.600,0:01:23.500
Having watched Emmanuel TV, we decided to come here, to The SCOAN.

0:01:23.500,0:01:27.620
We came here in June 2017.

0:01:27.620,0:01:32.600
Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me - I fell down and I felt cold.

0:01:32.600,0:01:38.940
When we came back to Norway, we ministered the Morning Water in the mornings and evenings.

0:01:38.940,0:01:48.120
After some time I went back to the hospital; they took an ultrasound and they couldn't find any cancer.

0:01:48.120,0:01:52.800
I'm free, I'm strong.

0:01:52.800,0:01:59.760
That is not enough for Jesus Christ; put your hands beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:01:59.760,0:02:02.080
Trust in God; He will do it.

0:02:02.080,0:02:04.900
Hallelujah!

0:02:04.900,0:02:07.580
You heard it - trust in God, He will do it.

0:02:07.580,0:02:10.100
No other one can do it, except Jesus Christ.

0:02:10.100,0:02:12.300
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:02:12.300,0:02:14.200
Good Morning, Church!

0:02:14.200,0:02:18.480
My name is Princess Grytli, I come from Norway.

0:02:18.480,0:02:21.880
The man beside me is my husband.

0:02:21.880,0:02:24.700
My husband got cancer in 2016.

0:02:24.700,0:02:28.860
It was so severe that he couldn't do anything at all.

0:02:28.860,0:02:31.320
The doctor said it was fifty - fifty.

0:02:31.320,0:02:39.820
I said that it was not a lottery to leave his body to "fifty - fifty".

0:02:39.820,0:02:46.700
In 2017, we came to The SCOAN.

0:02:46.700,0:02:51.760
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for my husband; he fell down, he felt cold.

0:02:51.760,0:02:59.040
After we went back to Norway, we ministered the Morning Water in the mornings and evenings.

0:02:59.040,0:03:07.360
After we ministered it, my husband went back to the hospital;

0:03:07.360,0:03:10.740
they checked him and said there was no more cancer.

0:03:10.740,0:03:15.400
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:03:15.400,0:03:23.480
Here is the medical report that I had a cancer of 2,7 centimetres in my thyroids,

0:03:23.480,0:03:31.140
and here is the confirmation from my doctor that there is no more cancer in my body.

0:03:31.140,0:03:35.420
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus!

0:03:35.420,0:03:42.960
My word of advice to all viewers and those here in the auditorium is to trust in God.

0:03:42.960,0:03:47.020
When you trust in God, all other things will be added to you, in Jesus' name.

0:03:47.020,0:03:51.180
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
