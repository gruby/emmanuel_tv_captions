0:00:00.080,0:00:04.980
A message the Lord said I should give to my African Continent:

0:00:05.860,0:00:08.260
No African country can succeed alone

0:00:09.820,0:00:15.600
Africans need each other to develop

0:00:18.120,0:00:19.160
tell your neighbour

0:00:22.820,0:00:27.020
West Africa needs Southern Africa to develop

0:00:27.940,0:00:31.640
Southern Africa needs West Africa to develop

0:00:32.600,0:00:36.300
North Africa needs East Africa to develop

0:00:36.920,0:00:40.200
and East Africa needs North Africa to develop

0:00:42.080,0:00:45.000
No one is self-sufficient

0:00:47.360,0:00:49.940
We can not do without each other

0:00:51.580,0:00:57.120
Everyone has a contribution

0:01:03.020,0:01:10.960
Whether you are poor, rich or an immigrant

0:01:12.400,0:01:18.180
everyone has a contribution

0:01:22.720,0:01:24.720
for the development of Africa

0:01:24.720,0:01:26.720
at the level we are now.

0:01:28.280,0:01:29.720
Dear Africans,

0:01:31.020,0:01:33.020
we should not let

0:01:35.020,0:01:40.500
other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries

0:01:42.280,0:01:45.400
With regard to the issue

0:01:49.600,0:01:51.900
of illegal immigrants,

0:01:56.920,0:02:00.480
drugs and other crimes

0:02:01.620,0:02:06.340
our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.

0:02:08.040,0:02:14.300
That is our duty - to give them useful information about issues like that

0:02:16.140,0:02:22.980
In our respective countries, our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.

0:02:24.220,0:02:29.120
It is only when they fail to carry out their duty,

0:02:30.200,0:02:36.480
that we citizens can lawfully protest.

0:02:38.700,0:02:40.120
I want to show you

0:02:42.040,0:02:44.180
a little video before I continue talking

0:02:45.020,0:02:50.300
There is no country in Africa that is not involved in what you are about to watch.

0:02:51.580,0:02:53.120
What is the cause?

0:02:54.080,0:03:00.180
Because Africa has neglected her youth

0:03:02.960,0:03:06.980
Africa has neglected her youth

0:03:07.120,0:03:09.600
the youth- they have neglected them

0:03:11.200,0:03:14.740
Africa has abandon the youth to themselves

0:03:17.200,0:03:22.160
Whereas tomorrow Africa is the youth.

0:03:23.920,0:03:28.400
But we have neglected them, that is the cause of this frustrations.

0:03:31.380,0:03:35.960
When I think about the future of Africa- I have sleepless nights.

0:03:37.240,0:03:40.500
Please can you play this cassette for me - please lets watch.

0:03:41.420,0:03:47.840
In the mediterranean of the cost of libya, this unstable fish boat is overloaded

0:03:48.160,0:03:50.640
with migrants and refugees.

0:03:52.040,0:03:56.280
So there is a horrible inevitability in what is about to happen.

0:03:57.400,0:03:59.680
The boat is starting to tilt

0:04:01.620,0:04:04.960
then the situation becomes so much worse.

0:04:09.100,0:04:14.640
Many jump to the water of the mediterranean before the boat completely capsizes.

0:04:18.340,0:04:21.600
Moments later it is completely overturned

0:04:23.220,0:04:26.120
Scores swam away from the shipwreck

0:04:27.040,0:04:30.420
but five people were found dead in the water.

0:04:32.960,0:04:37.920
But this man with 561 others were rescued

0:04:40.100,0:04:44.980
They are now safe but the scene of utter desperation we witness this time last year.

0:04:45.460,0:04:48.060
It constantly repeated itself.

0:05:32.120,0:05:35.720
They are your children, they are the youth of Africa

0:05:36.240,0:05:39.100
All- they are youth of Africa

0:05:40.300,0:05:44.300
There is no country in Africa that is not represented there.

0:05:48.060,0:05:53.340
This are your children that claim they have travelled outside the country.

0:05:54.040,0:05:58.120
Many of them are there - looking for green pastures.

0:06:04.560,0:06:08.880
Africa has neglected her youth.

0:06:10.660,0:06:17.540
Africa has abandoned the youth - to themselves.

0:06:19.940,0:06:28.200
Africa has failed to provide green pastures.

0:06:32.960,0:06:36.620
When I think about the future of Africa,

0:06:39.860,0:06:41.660
I have sleepless nights.

0:06:43.820,0:06:46.720
Within Africa, If we are now fighting within ourselves.

0:06:47.860,0:06:52.180
Look at what is happening in other continent concerning Africa.

0:06:52.780,0:06:56.060
Withi continents there is fight among the youth

0:07:03.380,0:07:06.780
Everything looks gloomy,

0:07:07.760,0:07:08.780
frustrating,

0:07:10.840,0:07:11.980
hopeless,

0:07:13.020,0:07:18.380
dark and darksome dull and  sunless.

0:07:19.980,0:07:22.460
Africa- Unite!

0:07:27.160,0:07:30.500
No African country can succeed alone,

0:07:34.080,0:07:37.160
we need each other to develop.

0:07:40.320,0:07:45.060
So, If we cannot understand ourselves within Africa

0:07:46.660,0:07:50.320
How can they understand us in other continents?

0:07:51.400,0:07:55.320
I was so troubled, and the Lord gave me the word.

0:07:56.780,0:08:02.260
I want to volunteer myself, and I know God has touched many Africans.

0:08:07.200,0:08:11.480
I know as am talking God has touched many Africans.

0:08:12.080,0:08:18.300
Many Africans that are in a position to help and I know many of them  are crying.

0:08:20.000,0:08:21.360
I am at your service.

0:08:22.120,0:08:24.100
We will not only sit in the church alone

0:08:24.100,0:08:27.220
You will learn that I will travel to the meetings with people

0:08:27.220,0:08:30.660
that are ready to talk about the challenges ahead.

0:08:35.240,0:08:37.500
Yes- look at the ministry

0:08:38.820,0:08:41.620
All counties, races are inside the church

0:08:42.840,0:08:44.680
God says he has realised you

0:08:45.740,0:08:49.460
He says he has touched many people that are in the position of honor and authority.

0:08:49.460,0:08:53.840
They are ready, lets come together- lets talk about the youth

0:08:53.880,0:08:55.560
that have been neglected.

0:08:56.620,0:08:58.260
They have been neglected

0:08:59.060,0:09:01.320
They have been abandoned to themselves.

0:09:01.600,0:09:03.440
No provision for our youths

0:09:04.980,0:09:09.840
When you are counting the best universities in the world

0:09:10.200,0:09:16.000
hardly will you see a single  university from Africa among 1-500.

0:09:16.480,0:09:19.120
There is no single African university.

0:09:20.460,0:09:22.420
can you see the decayness

0:09:28.320,0:09:30.160
The technology is zero.

0:09:34.020,0:09:41.020
You are flying to Dubai, you are flying to Turkey, you are flying to New york,

0:09:42.080,0:09:44.080
when are they flying into your country?

0:09:53.140,0:09:57.220
Look at your age, are you not going to witness that transformation

0:09:57.220,0:10:03.860
when Africa will become the centre where people will begin to discover themselves.

0:10:04.460,0:10:05.820
You are getting old.

0:10:08.620,0:10:11.120
Now your children, where is that future for them?

0:10:11.740,0:10:13.500
they gave been abandoned.

0:10:17.640,0:10:20.960
Because they have been abandoned that is the cause of frustrations.

0:10:23.120,0:10:26.220
Frustration can make anyone to do anything.

0:10:26.900,0:10:29.700
When you realise you are a graduate and there is no job and

0:10:29.700,0:10:31.980
you are looking at your age  wonder where are you going.

0:10:32.360,0:10:35.020
And everyday things are becoming worse

0:10:35.980,0:10:37.180
It is frustration

0:10:39.280,0:10:51.420
Dear Africa, we should not let other fellow African to feel unwelcome in our counties.

0:10:51.420,0:10:53.880
tell your neighbour, fellow Africa.

0:10:55.520,0:11:05.600
we should not let other fellow Africa feel unwelcome in our countries

0:11:06.140,0:11:06.940
Again!

0:11:13.860,0:11:20.160
No African country can succeed, can develope alone.

0:11:23.480,0:11:30.340
When it now comes to the issue of people taking drugs to a country or crime.

0:11:32.020,0:11:37.100
Our duty is to work with law enforcement

0:11:38.060,0:11:42.900
by giving them useful information about this people that are doing this.

0:11:45.320,0:11:46.460
That is our duty.

0:11:47.140,0:11:53.680
But if they now fail to do anything - then, lawfully we can protest.

0:11:56.800,0:12:01.580
Other nations are now laying bans on immigrants

0:12:02.220,0:12:07.000
definitely we Africans we should awake and rescue our people.

0:12:08.320,0:12:12.860
If there is ban in the immigrants, definitely this is the time we should awake.

0:12:13.520,0:12:15.540
What can we do to rescue our people?

0:12:15.740,0:12:19.980
Because this immigrants we are talking about 90% are Africans.

0:12:22.100,0:12:23.640
So they are coming back home.

0:12:25.200,0:12:27.800
And we have many of them are home already

0:12:28.300,0:12:29.340
on employment?

0:12:29.780,0:12:33.620
And we have millions coming to join on employment at home.

0:12:34.580,0:12:36.100
Where is the peace?

0:12:37.080,0:12:40.340
No matter how much you are blessed you can never have peace

0:12:40.840,0:12:43.340
if people around you are suffering.
