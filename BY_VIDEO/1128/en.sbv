Guided and directed by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer to the people

0:00:06.160,0:00:12.620
who have come from all over the world in need of the saving power, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:12.620,0:00:18.600
For satan's mission is to keep the children of God from the truth, where their true light comes from

0:00:18.600,0:00:22.040
and make them insensitive to God's voice.

0:00:22.040,0:00:28.640
As the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua approaches this lady, every darkness in her life is exposed

0:00:28.640,0:00:33.100
and manifests, in Jesus' name.

0:00:33.100,0:00:34.880
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:34.880,0:00:40.580
I am the spirit of death.

0:00:40.580,0:00:47.420
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:47.420,0:00:51.860
I will kill her.

0:00:51.860,0:00:56.700
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:56.700,0:01:04.860
I entered her when she touched a dead body.

0:01:04.860,0:01:09.980
With just a wave of his hand, Prophet T.B. Joshua, through the power of the Holy Spirit,

0:01:09.980,0:01:13.000
delivers her, in Jesus' name.

0:01:13.000,0:01:15.100
Glory be to God.

Deliverance Testimony

0:01:56.840,0:02:04.480
We have heard from this sister; she says she is a pastor from Korea, that she is into ministry work,

0:02:04.480,0:02:08.220
that she heals and delivers people.

0:02:08.220,0:02:13.820
She came to The SCOAN because she had the spirit of fear.

0:02:13.820,0:02:33.540
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:02:33.540,0:02:40.440
She said one day she received sad news from the family of her friend,

0:02:40.440,0:02:46.440
that her friend had been brought down with a terrible disease of pancreatic cancer

0:02:46.440,0:02:52.480
and she had only that night to live; at the end of that day she would die.

0:02:52.480,0:02:58.480
She was asked to come and minister prayer to the friend.

0:02:58.480,0:03:10.720
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:03:10.720,0:03:19.880
As a prayer minister, she says she has about 30 people that form a prayer team

0:03:19.880,0:03:26.980
and she asked the prayer team, that they should go with her and pray for her sick friend.

0:03:26.980,0:03:33.960
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:03:33.960,0:03:41.440
She said ever before she made that move to go and pray for this sick friend together with her prayer team,

0:03:41.440,0:03:49.400
she heard a voice speaking to her that it would take the soul of that friend.

0:03:49.400,0:04:25.020
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:04:25.020,0:04:28.680
She said she made the move and went to the hospital.

0:04:28.680,0:04:33.980
By the time she got to the hospital, her friend was at the point of death.

0:04:33.980,0:04:39.760
Because her mouth was open, she could sense a bad breath coming from her,

0:04:39.760,0:04:42.320
like a decayed organ.

0:04:42.320,0:04:49.520
This was coming from inside her friend who was lying at the hospital at the point of death.

0:04:49.520,0:04:58.680
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:04:58.680,0:05:06.600
She said she was not happy with the state in which she met her friend at the hospital.

0:05:06.600,0:05:11.660
She spent one hour praying for her sick friend.

0:05:11.660,0:05:14.220
After that she went back home.

0:05:14.220,0:05:46.880
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:05:46.880,0:05:51.400
By the time she got back home, she later received the news from the hospital

0:05:51.400,0:05:54.760
that her friend had died that same night.

0:05:54.760,0:05:57.460
She went and took a shower.

0:05:57.460,0:06:00.820
Right in front of her house, there is a sensor-light.

0:06:00.820,0:06:06.740
If a human being is present in the front of the door, the sensor-light would be on.

0:06:06.740,0:06:13.960
Immediately you leave the spot where the sensor-light is located, it is supposed to go off.

0:06:13.960,0:06:21.200
She said that by the time she went into her house, showered and came back in front of her house,

0:06:21.200,0:06:28.540
she detected and noticed that the sensor-light was still on.

0:06:28.540,0:06:33.460
She shouted, "Who is there?", because she believed that somebody must have been there,

0:06:33.460,0:06:35.580
for the sensor-light to still be on.

0:06:35.580,0:06:39.960
She shouted, "Who is there?", but nobody answered her.

0:06:39.960,0:06:56.360
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:06:56.360,0:07:02.900
Since she had that experience, the spirit of fear entered her because she believed

0:07:02.900,0:07:07.860
that the spirit being which she could not see was following her.

0:07:07.860,0:07:16.240
It was that spirit being that was present in the front of the sensor-light that made that light to be blinking,

0:07:16.240,0:07:19.740
despite the fact that she could not see that being.

0:07:19.740,0:07:44.540
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:07:44.540,0:07:49.260
She said that after the death of her friend, one day she was brushing her teeth

0:07:49.260,0:07:53.180
and she was standing in the front of her mirror in her house.

0:07:53.180,0:07:55.920
Rather than seeing her own face in the mirror,

0:07:55.920,0:08:03.260
she saw the face of her dead friend, staring at her from inside the mirror.

0:08:03.260,0:08:10.620
And that evil spirit told her that it was going to kill her the same way it had killed her friend

0:08:10.620,0:08:15.980
with that sickness of pancreatic cancer and also stop her ministry.

0:08:15.980,0:08:33.040
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:08:33.040,0:08:42.720
She said that ever since that evil spirit entered her, anytime she stood on the pulpit to preach,

0:08:42.720,0:08:49.660
it was not her preaching, but that evil spirit in her preaching to the congregation.

0:08:49.660,0:09:11.020
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:09:11.020,0:09:15.940
She said that ever since this happened, her congregants would tell her,

0:09:15.940,0:09:24.420
"Pastor, anytime you are on the pulpit preaching, we see another spirit being moving

0:09:24.420,0:09:26.700
just at the spot where you are".

0:09:26.700,0:09:50.260
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:09:50.260,0:09:54.160
She said that because of the predicament she found herself in,

0:09:54.160,0:09:59.220
it caused sleepless nights and great discomfort to her.

0:09:59.220,0:10:06.680
She called the prayer team and asked them to pray for her, but despite the ceaseless prayers

0:10:06.680,0:10:11.020
she could find no solution to the problem she was having.

0:10:11.020,0:10:57.300
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:10:57.300,0:11:04.460
She said she used to watch Emmanuel TV right in Korea and she had seen what God had been using

0:11:04.460,0:11:09.620
Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in the lives of the people; to heal, to deliver and to bless people.

0:11:09.620,0:11:15.900
Not only that; she also witnessed the prophetic message that the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:11:15.900,0:11:21.540
gave many years ago that there would be a reconciliation between North and South Korea,

0:11:21.540,0:11:25.440
and she has seen that prophecy come to pass.

0:11:25.440,0:11:34.040
All this gave her a great conviction and belief that if she stepped her feet here, at The SCOAN,

0:11:34.040,0:11:37.100
God Almighty would deliver her.

0:11:37.100,0:11:58.580
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:11:58.580,0:12:04.860
She said ever since the evil spirit entered her, it caused disagreements between her and the husband,

0:12:04.860,0:12:11.240
she began to have marital problems and her husband got irritated by any little action she took.

0:12:11.240,0:12:15.220
She began to have negative thoughts towards her husband;

0:12:15.220,0:12:18.960
at some point she even wished her husband was dead.

0:12:18.960,0:12:38.600
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:12:38.600,0:12:42.940
She said that as she was seated in the church auditorium last Sunday, and the man of God

0:12:42.940,0:12:49.040
Prophet T.B. Joshua was preaching to the congregants that if you pray for somebody

0:12:49.040,0:12:56.420
without first delivering that person, that means you are inheriting the person's problem.

0:12:56.420,0:12:59.560
That person's problems would definitely come to you.

0:12:59.560,0:13:06.420
She said as she heard that message, she was shocked that the Prophet was talking exactly to her.

0:13:06.420,0:13:14.620
That was exactly the problem she was having and that was the reason why she was at The SCOAN that Sunday.

0:13:14.620,0:13:39.700
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:13:39.700,0:13:43.640
As Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering prayer and deliverance to the congregants,

0:13:43.640,0:13:48.640
as he approached her, she wanted to run away but she could not.

0:13:48.640,0:13:53.920
She said she had gone to many churches, undergone many deliverances,

0:13:53.920,0:13:57.620
but she had never felt like that before.

0:13:57.620,0:14:12.460
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:14:12.460,0:14:19.000
She said that after the Prophet prayed for her; immediately he laid his hands on her,

0:14:19.000,0:14:22.120
that was all she could remember, until she found herself on the floor.

0:14:22.120,0:14:27.080
By the time she stood up, she felt so light.

0:14:27.080,0:14:36.500
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:14:36.500,0:14:37.400
Hallelujah!

0:14:37.400,0:14:42.140
She said ever since that prayer she has peace in her and she sleeps like a new-born baby.

0:14:42.140,0:14:48.980
Shall we put our hands together louder for Jesus!

0:14:48.980,0:14:55.300
How is she feeling now; is she still having those feelings of somebody following her anywhere she goes?

0:14:55.300,0:14:57.580
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:14:57.580,0:14:59.720
No, nobody is following me.

0:14:59.720,0:15:06.500
Hallelujah! Put your hands together once again for Jesus!

0:15:06.500,0:15:29.560
Pastor Park Soon Gyu
Deliverance Testimony

0:15:29.560,0:15:32.000
We have listened to that wonderful advice from our sister who said

0:15:32.000,0:15:35.240
that satan comes to kill, steal and destroy,

0:15:35.240,0:15:38.920
but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has come to give life, and life in abundance.

0:15:38.920,0:15:43.720
She is advising everyone: That whatever problem or situation you might be facing, run to Jesus

0:15:43.720,0:15:48.140
and He will see you through, because He is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.

0:15:48.140,0:15:51.620
We give glory to God for the wonderful deliverance you have received, mum.

0:15:51.620,0:15:54.660
And we just want to advise you that as God Almighty has delivered you and set you free,

0:15:54.660,0:15:59.640
continue to walk in the light of your testimony, making God's Word the standard for your life

0:15:59.640,0:16:03.540
and we know that more and more blessings are still coming your way, in Jesus' name.

0:16:03.540,0:16:08.660
Once again, shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
