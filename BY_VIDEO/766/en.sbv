Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
A Bulgarian Residing in Greece

0:00:14.940,0:00:16.620
My name is Dancho Hadziev.

0:00:16.620,0:00:21.380
I'm from Bulgaria but I reside in Thessaloniki, Greece.

0:00:21.380,0:00:32.240
Today, I have the grace to be here among you

0:00:32.240,0:00:37.860
to share with you my wonderful testimony

0:00:37.860,0:00:44.740
of what God has done for me.

0:00:44.740,0:00:48.460
I want to start from the beginning.

0:00:48.460,0:00:56.020
I was born in Bulgaria in a wealthy family.

0:00:56.020,0:01:07.460
For many years, whatever I wished, I could have.

0:01:07.460,0:01:16.020
As a result, when I went to junior high school,

0:01:16.020,0:01:19.800
I didn't care about anything

0:01:19.800,0:01:30.060
because my mother and father had great names in our howetown.

0:01:30.060,0:01:45.580
When I was in high school, I started a gang and we would harm people.

0:01:45.580,0:01:55.160
Anytime I did bad things,

0:01:55.160,0:02:03.420
when I had finished doing them, I realised that they were not good.

0:02:03.420,0:02:09.460
And yes, I kept doing them over and over again.

0:02:09.460,0:02:19.960
The evil things I did included beating other people,

0:02:19.960,0:02:23.180
taking their money

0:02:23.180,0:02:29.800
and making tattoos all over my body.

0:02:29.800,0:02:38.400
I had this thought that I was God.

0:02:38.400,0:02:42.000
A time came

0:02:42.000,0:02:47.900
when I didn't want to live the life I was living.

0:02:47.900,0:02:57.820
I had a dream since I was very young to become a police officer.

0:02:57.820,0:03:04.040
I entered the police force to become a police officer.

0:03:04.040,0:03:12.420
I must not forget that today is a day of truth.

0:03:12.420,0:03:20.300
When I went to school to become a police officer, things continued the same.

0:03:20.300,0:03:31.280
Although they taught us to be patient and humble and to do things the right away,

0:03:31.280,0:03:43.960
there was always something inside me that provoked me to do the opposite.

0:03:43.960,0:03:50.460
When I finished the school to become a police officer,

0:03:50.460,0:03:55.540
I became a police officer.

0:03:55.540,0:04:10.900
I thought I was the only one and there was nobody else apart from me.

0:04:10.900,0:04:22.180
Because of the authority I had, I made people feel bad.

0:04:22.180,0:04:29.080
In other words, I thought I was God.

0:04:29.080,0:04:39.100
These things did not cause me anything good.

0:04:39.100,0:04:57.320
Many of the people I had done bad things to, sued me as a police officer.

0:04:57.320,0:05:15.100
Higher ranking officers asked me what I was doing but I would not pay them any attention.

0:05:15.100,0:05:22.860
We have been listening to the experience of the brother, who said right from the young age he had joined a gang.

0:05:22.860,0:05:26.700
He was a bully at school and he oppressed people.

0:05:26.700,0:05:33.640
At some point he felt guilty about his bad attitude and he decided to fulfil his dream, that he had

0:05:33.640,0:05:38.000
right from the young age to become a police officer.

0:05:38.000,0:05:45.060
He went to the academy and he was trained as a police officer and later got employed in the police force

0:05:45.060,0:05:47.000
in his country, that is Greece.

0:05:47.000,0:05:54.100
He said that after he had joined the police force, because he was not yet delivered from that evil spirit

0:05:54.100,0:05:58.960
that had been tormenting his life, he still found himself doing the same thing

0:05:58.960,0:06:01.360
he had been doing right from his young age.

0:06:01.360,0:06:08.260
He said even as a police officer, rather than protect life and defend the oppressed, he found himself

0:06:08.260,0:06:15.200
being the one oppressing and bullying people, even as a police officer.

0:06:15.200,0:06:22.160
What experience can he share with the children of God; his attitude, oppression towards people,

0:06:22.160,0:06:23.960
as a police officer?

0:06:23.960,0:06:31.160
Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:06:31.160,0:06:35.540
I will give you an example.

0:06:35.540,0:06:46.780
Whether I was in my uniform or not, I was the same.

0:06:46.780,0:06:53.980
I had the spirit of anger.

0:06:53.980,0:07:03.940
One day, when we had a mission,

0:07:03.940,0:07:10.000
as we were going to arrest someone,

0:07:10.000,0:07:14.520
I was inside the police car.

0:07:14.520,0:07:25.660
A simple citizen passed in front of the car that I was in.

0:07:25.660,0:07:36.140
Anger arose inside me and I rushed out of the police car.

0:07:36.140,0:07:41.880
I couldn't remember what happened next.

0:07:41.880,0:07:49.980
My colleagues told me that I rushed out of the car

0:07:49.980,0:08:05.920
and beat the man in a way that nobody had ever done before.

0:08:05.920,0:08:35.140
Afterwards, I realised that I did something very bad asking myself why I had done that.

0:08:35.140,0:08:46.420
I asked myself why I did this when I was supposed to be an example to others.

0:08:46.420,0:08:57.860
The day came when I was called in to see the Chief of Police.

0:08:57.860,0:09:03.260
He told me that he wanted to tell me something.

0:09:03.260,0:09:11.980
He said that it was either I stopped what I was doing or they would sack me.

0:09:11.980,0:09:29.980
It is bad for a police officer to be sacked; so, he should resign instead.

0:09:29.980,0:09:34.500
However, I didn’t do that.

0:09:34.500,0:09:41.700
Instead, I got angry and grabbed him by his neck.

0:09:41.700,0:09:47.060
I told him I didn't care what he would do, that I had money and everything I wanted

0:09:47.060,0:09:56.000
and that he should rather perish.

0:09:56.000,0:10:12.000
The time came when I was at home and I received a sack letter from the police force.

0:10:12.000,0:10:20.600
We have just heard from the brother who said that as a result of this spirit of anger in him, he got to a point

0:10:20.600,0:10:28.040
where he oppressed the citizen of his country while being on a mission to arrest somebody.

0:10:28.040,0:10:36.460
On their way, an ordinary citizen passed in front of their vehicle.

0:10:36.460,0:10:43.900
He rushed of a car in anger, grabbed that man, and beat him mercilessly.

0:10:43.900,0:10:51.300
He said that he didn't remember what he had done to this man, which proves that an evil spirit was behind

0:10:51.300,0:10:52.620
that anger.

0:10:52.620,0:11:00.460
It was his colleagues that told him of that great offence he committed beating this man mercilessly.

0:11:00.460,0:11:08.940
As a result, he was called to his superior in the police force.

0:11:08.940,0:11:14.180
They advised him saying that what he was doing was bad for the image of the police force.

0:11:14.180,0:11:17.740
They gave him a choice to stop or be sacked.

0:11:17.740,0:11:27.860
Instead of feeling remorse or guilt for what he had done, he became angry; he grabbed the superior officer,

0:11:27.860,0:11:35.780
he shook him and told him that he had money and he could do anything.

0:11:35.780,0:11:50.360
Few days later he received a sack letter from the police force.

0:11:50.360,0:11:57.980
When they gave me the sack letter, I was very unhappy.

0:11:57.980,0:12:11.220
So, since I already had a bad reputation, I made the decision to continue the same lifestyle.

0:12:11.220,0:12:23.840
I got involved with the mafia.

0:12:23.840,0:12:38.220
Because I knew many people in the police force, I could do whatever I wanted.

0:12:38.220,0:12:54.000
I started having friends who were smoking cannabis and drinking.

0:12:54.000,0:13:03.300
So, I was doing the same thing as a young man in the world.

0:13:03.300,0:13:09.080
I got very frustrated with what I was doing but couldn't stop it.

0:13:09.080,0:13:30.660
Every time I did something evil, I would tell myself that it was the last time.

0:13:30.660,0:13:41.480
I couldn't stop; I would do it again and again

0:13:41.480,0:13:49.460
Many times, I tried on my own to stop smoking,

0:13:49.460,0:13:57.880
drinking alcohol and the lifestyle I was living

0:13:57.880,0:14:03.540
because I knew that that lifestyle was not normal.

0:14:03.540,0:14:18.760
Something inside of me was telling me that there was a plan for me.

0:14:18.760,0:14:27.880
We heard from the brother who said that he always had felt he could not get out of his problem on his own.

0:14:27.880,0:14:32.780
Can you tell us what happened that led to your deliverance?

0:14:32.780,0:14:39.060
Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:14:39.060,0:14:53.260
One day, when I was at home, a man from Bulgaria that I didn’t know, came to visit me.

0:14:53.260,0:15:03.060
He started talking to me about Jesus Christ but I told him that I already knew Him.

0:15:03.060,0:15:13.600
I told him to tell me something new and he asked me to sit down and said he would.

0:15:13.600,0:15:21.600
As we were talking, he introduced me to Emmanuel TV.

0:15:21.600,0:15:32.780
This man was very patient with me because I was behaving badly.

0:15:32.780,0:15:42.240
Through his mobile phone, he opened Emmanuel TV.

0:15:42.240,0:15:48.560
He started showing me videos of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:15:48.560,0:16:04.600
The first time I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua, I wondered, “Is this African man healing people?

0:16:04.600,0:16:07.880
He must be a fraudster”.

0:16:07.880,0:16:19.500
However something within me was telling me that I should not talk like that

0:16:19.500,0:16:24.680
because if truly God had covered him with His blood, I would be in trouble.

0:16:24.680,0:16:34.820
So, I stopped talking in that way to the man who was sitting beside me.

0:16:34.820,0:16:43.740
Since that day, I started watching Emmanuel TV all day long.

0:16:43.740,0:16:54.640
Sunday came and it was a live service at The SCOAN.

0:16:54.640,0:17:11.700
Within me, I decided to dedicate the day to watch Emmanuel TV and see what was happening.

0:17:11.700,0:17:22.320
As I was watching, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for people.

0:17:22.320,0:17:33.140
I was thinking to myself, ‘Lord, if You are truly there in this Church,

0:17:33.140,0:17:42.660
as this man is praying, if  You are the Healer, Deliverer, Redeemer, and everything,

0:17:42.660,0:17:53.320
help me to believe this and see that it’s true’.

0:17:53.320,0:17:57.440
Then, I received the answer.

0:17:57.440,0:18:03.460
Since that time, my life changed!

0:18:03.460,0:18:11.980
Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:18:11.980,0:18:17.760
My life changed and I stopped smoking.

0:18:17.760,0:18:27.060
I will start from the smaller things that the Lord has done for me.

0:18:27.060,0:18:32.860
Before, I was a very big gambler.

0:18:32.860,0:18:39.660
I stopped gambling.

0:18:39.660,0:18:54.460
I stopped smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol and doing anything that had to do with the world.

0:18:54.460,0:19:00.680
However, I will tell you the greatest thing that the Lord has done for me.

0:19:00.680,0:19:12.900
Because of all the things I was doing, I had many court cases.

0:19:12.900,0:19:20.420
The Lord made all these cases disappear!

0:19:20.420,0:19:22.700
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:19:22.700,0:19:28.600
Put your hands together for the miracle working God, for what He has done in the life of this brother!

0:19:28.600,0:19:32.720
Hallelujah!

0:19:32.720,0:19:39.500
In this way I received the greatest miracle.

0:19:39.500,0:19:55.360
They called me from the police force, asking me to come back and speak with them.

0:19:55.360,0:20:07.260
I went there and was re-hired for the same job!

0:20:07.260,0:20:13.580
Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:20:13.580,0:20:25.440
I am now a special agent and the head of my team in the police force.

0:20:25.440,0:20:26.220
Hallelujah!

0:20:26.220,0:20:33.420
Put your hands together louder for the miracle working God!

0:20:33.420,0:20:38.460
I know that this testimony have lifted your faith to another level.

0:20:38.460,0:20:42.780
Brother standing right before us was deep into the world.

0:20:42.780,0:20:45.180
This thing cost him a lot.

0:20:45.180,0:20:52.660
It cost him his job, his reputation in the society, he was affected both emotionally and physically.

0:20:52.660,0:21:02.940
But in the moment Jesus Christ got into his life; He healed and delivered him completely and effectually.

0:21:02.940,0:21:10.880
Put your hands together louder for the miracle working God!

0:21:10.880,0:21:12.500
Hallelujah!

0:21:12.500,0:21:18.580
Our brother said something; a comment he made - "What can an African brother do to you?"

0:21:18.580,0:21:24.540
Now, that God Almighty has used His Prophet to deliver you and set you free -

0:21:24.540,0:21:35.740
what can you say about the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:21:35.740,0:21:50.100
I want to tell people all over the world who are hearing this testimony today

0:21:50.100,0:21:59.140
who have spoken negative words about this ministry and Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:21:59.140,0:22:04.700
to go and ask for forgiveness from the Lord.

0:22:04.700,0:22:18.420
Because Prophet T.B. Joshua is a true prophet and a real man of God.

0:22:18.420,0:22:23.700
What is your advice to millions of people that are listening to you right now?

0:22:23.700,0:22:29.400
What advise do you have for them all?

0:22:29.400,0:22:46.240
My advice to those in the same situation I once was in or facing another problem -

0:22:46.240,0:22:52.080
don’t run away from God but run to Him.

0:22:52.080,0:22:56.720
They have to go through this situation with God.
