NIGERIAN ELECTIONS MAY LIKELY BE...

0:00:04.680,0:00:09.280
As we continue to pray for the upcoming Nigerian Presidential Elections,

0:00:09.280,0:00:13.880
let us remember the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua on Sunday February 10, 2019, as quoted in an article:

0:00:13.880,0:00:17.840
"The Nigerian election may likely be postponed because of many challenges.

0:00:17.840,0:00:22.280
In whatever way, God is in control...

0:00:22.280,0:00:27.560
God will not allow anything to happen to Nigeria.

0:00:27.560,0:00:31.060
It is just a cloud that is hovering. Be calm.

0:00:31.060,0:00:35.080
The nation has a strong bond with God. Nigeria will stand.

0:00:35.080,0:00:39.920
Those who will cause trouble will see trouble and those who will cause peace will see peace

0:00:39.920,0:00:44.400
but the nation Nigeria will stand."
