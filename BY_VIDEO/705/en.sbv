0:00:00.140,0:00:05.000
My name is Emmanuel Newman C.

0:00:05.000,0:00:07.800
I am a Nigerian from Anambra State.

0:00:07.800,0:00:09.900
I reside in Gabon.

0:00:09.900,0:00:13.680
My testimony goes like this:

0:00:13.680,0:00:18.120
I was suffering from the spirit of lust, masturbation,

0:00:18.120,0:00:22.760
smoking, womanising and drinking.

0:00:22.760,0:00:29.340
With all these, I became a Christian without being delivered.

0:00:29.340,0:00:33.040
I preached the Word of God and would evangelise.

0:00:33.040,0:00:34.980
Listen to that statement:

0:00:34.980,0:00:39.240
He said he became a Christian without being delivered

0:00:39.240,0:00:41.860
and that is thousand people today.

0:00:41.860,0:00:46.560
When you are a Christian and you are not delivered, you are religious.

0:00:46.560,0:00:51.780
There is a difference between Christianity and religion.

0:00:51.780,0:00:55.780
You don't need to be delivered before you become a religious man

0:00:55.780,0:00:58.900
but you need to be delivered to become a Christian.

0:00:58.900,0:01:05.000
Christianity is all about a relationship with Jesus

0:01:05.000,0:01:07.940
and Jesus is the Deliverer.

0:01:07.940,0:01:12.420
For you to have a relationship with Him, you need to be delivered.

0:01:12.420,0:01:16.500
The difference between Christianity and religion is:

0:01:16.500,0:01:20.560
Christianity - you need to be delivered to become a Christian.

0:01:20.560,0:01:24.300
You don't need to be delivered before you become what? - A religious man.

0:01:24.300,0:01:30.040
That is why today, if you see twenty people today gather and they say they are Christians,

0:01:30.040,0:01:35.220
out of these twenty, hardly one of them is a Christian.

0:01:35.220,0:01:39.120
All nineteen are religious people.

0:01:39.120,0:01:42.360
What are the characteristics of a religious man?

0:01:42.360,0:01:46.020
One of the characteristics is you see them always complaining.

0:01:46.020,0:01:51.640
"I have headache. I have pain. I have this. I have that."

0:01:51.640,0:01:56.280
In the face of their faith, they believe that their pain or trouble will kill them.

0:01:56.280,0:01:57.380
What else again?

0:01:57.380,0:02:03.260
"When is he going? Gradually, he is to go." - You will know he is a religious man.

0:02:03.260,0:02:07.400
Religious people always give a time to God.

0:02:07.400,0:02:12.100
I was preaching the Gospel and said I was a Christian

0:02:12.100,0:02:16.240
but this sin kept on tormenting me.

0:02:16.240,0:02:26.380
That masturbation became so much that I saw preaching as just fun

0:02:26.380,0:02:30.880
because people loved it but at a time, I gave up.

0:02:30.880,0:02:36.680
Through that sin, I went into smoking, drinking and living all kinds of lives.

0:02:36.680,0:02:41.600
This thing has cost me a lot of setback in life. I never made it.

0:02:41.600,0:02:43.960
Nothing worked for me.

0:02:43.960,0:02:48.740
My life became wayward and I started thinking;

0:02:48.740,0:02:54.540
this Jesus might be just an ordinary religion, like I understood other religions,

0:02:54.540,0:02:59.680
just ordinary belief. Maybe He did not exist because to say the truth,

0:02:59.680,0:03:04.500
the miracles we are seeing here, I have not seen them anywhere in the world.

0:03:04.500,0:03:08.820
I read so many books during the time when I was preaching

0:03:08.820,0:03:13.060
and teaching the Word of God but I had not seen this kind.

0:03:13.060,0:03:17.180
One of my friends first of all introduced me to Emmanuel TV.

0:03:17.180,0:03:26.460
I said, "No, we have heard about this man!

0:03:26.460,0:03:29.860
People said a lot about him.

0:03:29.860,0:03:32.380
Forget about it!" But he said, "No, I had to watch this".

0:03:32.380,0:03:34.120
I said, "No, I don't want to watch this".

0:03:34.120,0:03:40.200
Even in our church, they asked us not to watch all other Christian channels,

0:03:40.200,0:03:43.940
especially like The SCOAN.

0:03:43.940,0:03:48.740
One day, I visited one of my friends and he was watching Emmanuel TV.

0:03:48.740,0:03:53.500
I heard a message while watching Emmanuel TV that said,

0:03:53.500,0:04:04.560
"If you make a mistake as we all do, don't run from God, run to God".

0:04:04.560,0:04:08.900
I saw the message and told the guy, "Please, don't switch off this station",

0:04:08.900,0:04:15.420
I just wanted to see whether it was the man of God, T.B. Joshua, that was saying this.

0:04:15.420,0:04:18.920
I thought he must be saying something important so I watched the message.

0:04:18.920,0:04:24.040
I heard a lot of messages that I had not heard before - very slow and powerful.

0:04:24.040,0:04:25.960
This message turned my life around.

0:04:25.960,0:04:28.220
I asked my friend, "How can I get this station?"

0:04:28.220,0:04:34.100
He said, "Just buy a decoder. I will call one of the technicians to place it for you".

0:04:34.100,0:04:38.100
I said, "Okay". I had to do everything quickly because that message touched me.

0:04:38.100,0:04:41.080
Because of this sin, I was running away from the Word of God.

0:04:41.080,0:04:43.880
I didn't like hearing the Word of God.

0:04:43.880,0:04:48.700
It made me afraid; I would think God hated me.

0:04:48.700,0:04:54.040
This message gave me hope and courage that there was still hope for me.

0:04:54.040,0:04:57.260
That even the man of God was saying,

0:04:57.260,0:05:00.200
"If we make mistakes as we all do, don't run from God; run to Him".

0:05:00.200,0:05:04.320
I said, "Okay, let me see. Since I have run before to God,

0:05:04.320,0:05:08.780
the way I claim, but I am still masturbating. So, let me see.

0:05:08.780,0:05:12.820
I will just keep on watching this station and see what will happen.

0:05:12.820,0:05:15.100
So, I started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:05:15.100,0:05:18.200
I saw the miracles that were happening.

0:05:18.200,0:05:21.460
The things I had read in the Bible, I started seeing it physically.

0:05:21.460,0:05:26.380
I said, "Wow, this might be a film or something. I don't know".

0:05:26.380,0:05:33.840
I told one of my friends that what I saw on Emmanuel TV was exactly what the Bible said.

0:05:33.840,0:05:38.400
He said, "It is happening". I asked, "In my country, Nigeria?" and he said, "Yes, in Nigeria".

0:05:38.400,0:05:39.720
I said, "Ah!"

0:05:39.720,0:05:45.300
I said that now I wanted to see the power of God.

0:05:45.300,0:05:49.760
I sat down. I was with my packet of cigarettes, still living the same life

0:05:49.760,0:05:55.220
but the one thing that kept me going on was when he said, "If we make mistakes,

0:05:55.220,0:05:58.160
we should not run from God". I said, "God, I will not run from You now.

0:05:58.160,0:06:01.540
I will watch You until You change my life".

0:06:01.540,0:06:02.640
I was watching Emmanuel TV.

0:06:02.640,0:06:06.660
So when the man of God said, "Lay your hand on the screen and pray",

0:06:06.660,0:06:09.620
I was still doing the same things. I stubbed my cigarette.

0:06:09.620,0:06:11.460
Even my brother can bear witness.

0:06:11.460,0:06:13.600
One of my brothers came to my sitting room and said,

0:06:13.600,0:06:17.120
"You are watching the things of God and you are still smoking.

0:06:17.120,0:06:18.880
You do not respect God".

0:06:18.880,0:06:23.080
I said, "No, this is beyond me. It is God that will do it".

0:06:23.080,0:06:26.340
So, I went to the screen and laid my hand on the screen

0:06:26.340,0:06:28.020
while the man of God was praying.

0:06:28.020,0:06:33.160
Immediately something left me but I didn't take it as anything.

0:06:33.160,0:06:38.860
So, I just went away. The decision just came to me. I packed my cigarettes.

0:06:38.860,0:06:43.360
There was one in my kitchen, sitting room, even inside my car.

0:06:43.360,0:06:46.020
I went down to the car and took the packet there.

0:06:46.020,0:06:48.120
I packed everything and threw it in the dustbin.

0:06:48.120,0:06:54.640
I went to my room because CDs of pornographic films filled my house.

0:06:54.640,0:06:57.200
I just picked them up and threw them into the dustbin

0:06:57.200,0:06:58.800
and said I wouldn't do this again.

0:06:58.800,0:07:01.840
I just left and forgot about everything.

0:07:01.840,0:07:05.760
The most surprising thing was cigarettes.

0:07:05.760,0:07:10.460
I left, forgot about the prayer and went to my normal business.

0:07:10.460,0:07:13.520
I didn't smoke. This started around three o'clock.

0:07:13.520,0:07:18.960
I didn't smoke. I even forgot about cigarettes 'til the next day.

0:07:18.960,0:07:21.560
I went with my friends to a restaurant. We went to go and eat.

0:07:21.560,0:07:25.880
My friend was a smoker too. After eating, he bought a stick of cigarettes.

0:07:25.880,0:07:31.000
He offered them to me. It was then I remembered. I said, "Please, I won't smoke.

0:07:31.000,0:07:34.520
Could you imagine that since yesterday, I laid my hands on Emmanuel TV,

0:07:34.520,0:07:37.200
prayed and forgot all about cigarettes".

0:07:37.200,0:07:43.200
He said, "Forget about that. We know you. I take sticks but you smoke packets.

0:07:43.200,0:07:45.360
How can you say you can just stop cigarettes just like that?"

0:07:45.360,0:07:47.800
I said, "No, I won't smoke. Keep your cigarettes".

0:07:47.800,0:07:53.380
From there, I started imagining. It was as if I had never smoked before.

0:07:53.380,0:07:58.380
This deliverance is real. It is as if I had never smoked before.

0:07:58.380,0:08:03.420
So, if you want to be a Christian and you are still struggling with that urge,

0:08:03.420,0:08:07.080
it is religious. You just need real deliverance.

0:08:07.080,0:08:12.380
Once you are delivered, you would know that you are a different person entirely.

0:08:12.380,0:08:18.320
I started looking at myself and wondering what had happened.

0:08:18.320,0:08:21.400
It was as if I had never smoked before. I couldn't hold myself.

0:08:21.400,0:08:24.040
I started telling people. People were laughing.

0:08:24.040,0:08:27.080
People that knew me well said, "You have started again.

0:08:27.080,0:08:29.460
We knew you before when you were carrying the Bible.

0:08:29.460,0:08:31.460
Now, you have come again".

0:08:31.460,0:08:33.920
I said, "No, this one is different.

0:08:33.920,0:08:43.680
Before, I just did it myself but now Jesus has decided to take over everything".

0:08:43.680,0:08:46.600
It is not drama.

0:08:46.600,0:08:49.760
When you just stretch your hand along with me, that is the end!

0:08:49.760,0:09:00.860
The Spirit of God will enter you, and you will stop those bad habits!

0:09:00.860,0:09:05.720
Now, viewers all over the world, I want to give you; now, it is time.

0:09:05.720,0:09:10.560
Listen once again. You have listened to our brother; receive yours now.

0:09:10.560,0:09:14.640
As you watch God's power,

0:09:14.640,0:09:24.140
never a sickness Jesus cannot heal; never a disease Jesus cannot cure.

0:09:24.140,0:09:30.180
As you watch God's power, never a burden Jesus cannot bear.

0:09:30.180,0:09:39.020
As you watch God's power, trust Him; your situation will change.

0:09:39.020,0:09:49.600
Are you sick? Touch Him; you will be healed, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:49.600,0:09:56.960
Are you poor? Be blessed, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:09:56.960,0:10:02.640
Whatever name you call that sickness, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal!

0:10:02.640,0:10:09.700
Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:09.700,0:10:20.040
Believe Him; your needs will be met, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:20.040,0:10:33.040
If you have eaten through dreams or from the table of your enemy, adversary

0:10:33.040,0:10:45.460
or from the table of demons, be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:45.460,0:10:54.980
Be washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ!

0:10:54.980,0:10:59.320
In the name of Jesus!
