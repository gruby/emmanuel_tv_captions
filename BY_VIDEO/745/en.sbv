0:00:00.340,0:00:04.040
Prophet T.B. Joshua sent his evangelists to minister the Morning Water

0:00:04.040,0:00:06.840
to the congregation in Jesus' name.

0:00:06.840,0:00:12.320
The name of Jesus is power and fire which makes satan and his agents flee.

0:00:12.320,0:00:18.320
As the Morning Water is ministered, every evil spirit in the lives of the people is exposed

0:00:18.320,0:00:22.040
and they are set free in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:22.040,0:00:27.480
Let's see what happens as the evangelist encounters this lady.

0:00:27.480,0:00:30.740
Now, speak! Fire! Who are you in this body?

0:00:30.740,0:00:32.080
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:32.080,0:00:33.700
I told you before. I don't want to talk.

0:00:33.700,0:00:37.300
Say it again, in the name of Jesus Christ! Who are you in this body?

0:00:37.300,0:00:40.060
I have been here but I didn't talk.

0:00:40.060,0:00:41.980
When I came here, I didn't talk.

0:00:41.980,0:00:43.980
You have no choice than to speak.

0:00:43.980,0:00:48.860
I told you before. I'm her spiritual husband.

0:00:48.860,0:00:53.760
Apart from spiritual husband, who else is in this body? Speak, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:53.760,0:00:58.720
Speak out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:58.720,0:01:00.220
Spirit of anger.

0:01:00.220,0:01:03.800
Now, as spirit of anger, what have you done to her?

0:01:03.800,0:01:05.640
I destroyed her.

0:01:05.640,0:01:07.380
How did you destroy her?

0:01:07.380,0:01:10.980
She is a good woman. You know that? She is a good woman.

0:01:10.980,0:01:13.560
I want to destroy her.

0:01:13.560,0:01:15.560
She likes helping people.

0:01:15.560,0:01:17.580
Look here!

0:01:17.580,0:01:22.140
As spirit of anger, what have you done to her? Answer my question!

0:01:22.140,0:01:24.820
I made her to have children with different men.

0:01:24.820,0:01:26.940
Now, she is pregnant.

0:01:26.940,0:01:29.520
How many men have you made her to have children for?

0:01:29.520,0:01:33.600
Three. Now, she is pregnant.

0:01:33.600,0:01:39.420
Tell us - as spirit of anger, what did you do to the first, second and third marriage?

0:01:39.420,0:01:43.620
I destroyed everything because she is my wife.

0:01:43.620,0:01:44.620
I married her.

0:01:44.620,0:01:53.340
I destroyed everything of hers because she is a good woman; she likes helping people.

0:01:53.340,0:01:56.560
"Ah, you have a problem. Please, take this money."

0:01:56.560,0:01:59.420
Why does she help people?

0:01:59.420,0:02:00.360
Why?

0:02:00.360,0:02:04.100
I want people to suffer.

0:02:04.100,0:02:06.660
Now, how did you destroy the second marriage?

0:02:06.660,0:02:11.700
She had married once; I destroyed it.

0:02:11.700,0:02:17.860
They followed her but I was there protecting her - nobody will marry her.

0:02:17.860,0:02:22.040
They came to marry her but she said, "No".

0:02:22.040,0:02:24.800
The three children she had - for how many men?

0:02:24.800,0:02:26.480
Speak, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:26.480,0:02:28.080
Three men.

0:02:28.080,0:02:34.440
She is pregnant; this is her third baby with a stupid man.

0:02:34.440,0:02:39.680
That man has his own problem.

0:02:39.680,0:02:43.440
As spirit of anger, what have you caused her marriage?

0:02:43.440,0:02:45.020
Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:02:45.020,0:02:46.320
I told you.

0:02:46.320,0:02:47.200
That what?

0:02:47.200,0:02:50.360
I destroyed the marriage because she is my wife.

0:02:50.360,0:02:53.580
How many times do I have to tell you that she is my wife?

0:02:53.580,0:02:56.260
When I came here, I never talked.

0:02:56.260,0:02:59.060
But you - you forced me to talk today.

0:02:59.060,0:03:03.740
I have been here three times. I never talked; I always hid myself.

0:03:03.740,0:03:06.340
Why do you make me to talk today? You!

0:03:06.340,0:03:09.480
Today is your day and Jesus wants you to speak.

0:03:09.480,0:03:11.220
You have no choice; you have to speak.

0:03:11.220,0:03:13.220
Now, speak! What else have you done to her?

0:03:13.220,0:03:16.120
I told you that she is a very good woman.

0:03:16.120,0:03:17.920
She has a nice future.

0:03:17.920,0:03:20.440
She likes God.

0:03:20.440,0:03:26.620
I made her to go to spiritualists.

0:03:26.620,0:03:28.620
Now, she knows God.

0:03:28.620,0:03:32.160
She says, "God of T.B. Joshua, please help me.

0:03:32.160,0:03:35.960
I have been coming there but I still have problems

0:03:35.960,0:03:42.160
but I will never give up with the God of T.B. Joshua. I will still go to Nigeria".

0:03:42.160,0:03:44.480
She has been coming here. She came here three times.

0:03:44.480,0:03:46.920
This woman is from where?

0:03:46.920,0:03:49.880
She is from which country? Speak out!

0:03:49.880,0:03:55.280
She is from Kenya. She got married in Japan.

0:03:55.280,0:03:56.360
Ok?

0:03:56.360,0:03:58.720
Ok. What have you done to her career?

0:03:58.720,0:04:00.980
It is a mistake to make me talk.

0:04:00.980,0:04:02.620
Come here! What have you done to her career?

0:04:02.620,0:04:04.200
Answer me, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:04:04.200,0:04:05.440
What have you done to her career?

0:04:05.440,0:04:09.800
Which career - tell me? Which one? Do you see anything like career here?

0:04:09.800,0:04:15.360
I messed with her life since she was young, a small baby; I grew in her.

0:04:15.360,0:04:18.680
I have been there, doing these rubbish things.

0:04:18.680,0:04:20.300
She never even went to school.

0:04:20.300,0:04:25.880
She can speak English but she never went to school - she is trying!

0:04:25.880,0:04:31.040
She tried her best every day but I was still there.

0:04:31.040,0:04:33.640
But today, you make me to talk!

0:04:33.640,0:04:36.340
I was here a long time ago but I never talked.

0:04:36.340,0:04:38.920
What have you done to the father of the pregnancy?

0:04:38.920,0:04:43.540
That man is a married man.

0:04:43.540,0:04:47.020
I sent that man to make her pregnant.

0:04:47.020,0:04:48.440
That is my job.

0:04:48.440,0:04:49.400
Yes!

0:04:49.400,0:04:52.160
What is your gain, you demon?

0:04:52.160,0:04:54.280
She wanted to abort the baby.

0:04:54.280,0:04:58.960
The man said, "I will not send you for that abortion".

0:04:58.960,0:05:05.000
Because she is a Christian, she said, "I will have this baby; maybe it is a baby boy".

0:05:05.000,0:05:07.320
How did you enter her?

0:05:07.320,0:05:13.480
I entered her since she was born from her mother's womb.

0:05:13.480,0:05:16.900
I took her from that day.

0:05:16.900,0:05:19.260
She became my wife.

0:05:19.260,0:05:20.580
And who are you?

0:05:20.580,0:05:23.340
I'm her spiritual husband.

0:05:23.340,0:05:27.280
You have made the greatest mistake in allowing her to come here.

0:05:27.280,0:05:30.860
Now, you evil spirit that kills, steals and destroys -

0:05:30.860,0:05:37.740
today is an end of you and you have to leave her body right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:37.740,0:05:40.300
Now, out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:40.300,0:05:46.200
I command Holy Ghost fire to consume and burn every negative spirit in your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:46.200,0:05:47.960
Fire all over your body!

0:05:47.960,0:05:51.820
From your head to the sole of your feet, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:51.820,0:05:56.040
You have no choice. You have to leave right now. Your time has expired.

0:05:56.040,0:05:58.740
Now, out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:58.740,0:05:59.680
I'm not going.

0:05:59.680,0:06:02.640
You have no choice. You have to leave in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:06:02.640,0:06:03.640
I will never leave her!

0:06:03.640,0:06:05.400
You have to leave!

0:06:05.400,0:06:09.920
You have to leave! You have no choice.

0:06:09.920,0:06:15.160
Now, pack all your things, you spirit of anger and all of you!

0:06:15.160,0:06:18.580
Now, out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:18.580,0:06:20.500
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:20.500,0:06:22.900
You have no choice. You are making a mistake.

0:06:22.900,0:06:25.480
You have no choice. You have to leave, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:06:25.480,0:06:27.480
You have to leave. Come here!

0:06:27.480,0:06:28.760
Come here!

0:06:28.760,0:06:30.540
You have to leave, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:06:30.540,0:06:32.220
Now, you have to go!

0:06:32.220,0:06:35.760
You have to go! Continue to remove everything!

0:06:35.760,0:06:42.340
Everything that belongs to you - remove it right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:42.340,0:06:50.540
Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:50.540,0:06:53.440
Remember, you cannot deceive anyone! You have to come out!

0:06:53.440,0:06:56.080
Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:56.080,0:07:01.660
That evil spirit, that demon that has been deposited in your body,

0:07:01.660,0:07:04.900
come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:04.900,0:07:10.740
I am a big snake.

0:07:10.740,0:07:18.000
I live here.

0:07:18.000,0:07:20.000
Now, all of you will leave right now!

0:07:20.000,0:07:21.400
All of you will leave!

0:07:21.400,0:07:24.220
You python, out of this body! Fire all over your body!

0:07:24.220,0:07:25.600
Fire all over your body!

0:07:25.600,0:07:29.520
Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:29.520,0:07:32.180
As a snake - can you move as a snake?

0:07:32.180,0:07:37.060
Move as a snake; let us see you!

0:07:37.060,0:07:41.840
Move as a snake, you demon!

0:07:41.840,0:07:45.700
When you move like this, what happens?

0:07:45.700,0:07:49.800
You know what happens.

0:07:49.800,0:07:52.180
She will not be happy.

0:07:52.180,0:07:57.060
Now all of you demons, in the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ,

0:07:57.060,0:08:04.540
out!

0:08:04.540,0:08:10.260
Your back on the floor, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:10.260,0:08:15.740
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:08:15.740,0:08:18.520
Thank You, Jesus Christ, for her deliverance!

0:08:18.520,0:08:20.940
Thank You, Jesus Christ, for sending us this Morning Water

0:08:20.940,0:08:23.500
through your servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:23.500,0:08:25.500
You are free, in Jesus' name.

0:08:25.500,0:08:27.920
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:08:27.920,0:08:29.220
Rise up, sister.

0:08:29.220,0:08:32.140
You are delivered through the medium of Morning Water

0:08:32.140,0:08:34.580
and you are delivered forever, in Jesus' name.

0:08:34.580,0:08:36.720
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:08:36.720,0:08:38.720
Thank You, Jesus!

0:08:38.720,0:08:41.460
I will never give up on You!

0:08:41.460,0:08:46.120
Thank You, Jesus!

0:08:46.120,0:08:49.100
I have been suffering for long. Thank You!

0:08:49.100,0:08:52.120
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:08:52.120,0:08:53.860
Sister, your past is over.

0:08:53.860,0:08:57.860
Jesus Christ has just delivered you through the medium of the Morning Water

0:08:57.860,0:09:01.860
sent to you by Prophet T.B. Joshua and don't cry anymore.

0:09:01.860,0:09:04.520
Today, the Lord Jesus Christ has restored your joy

0:09:04.520,0:09:07.280
and you will continue to walk in the light of your testimony, in Jesus' name.

0:09:07.280,0:09:09.540
Amen.

0:09:09.540,0:09:11.060
Thank You, Jesus!

0:09:11.060,0:09:15.520
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:09:15.520,0:09:20.340
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:09:20.340,0:09:25.620
My name is Bahati. I am originally from Kenya.

0:09:25.620,0:09:28.020
I live in Japan.

0:09:28.020,0:09:35.000
I am so happy to be here to testify about my deliverance.

0:09:35.000,0:09:37.760
My testimony goes like this.

0:09:37.760,0:09:49.520
I was born into a poverty-stricken family and did not know my father.

0:09:49.520,0:09:57.980
I grew up with my mum and she could not afford to send me to school.

0:09:57.980,0:10:07.880
When I was eight or nine years old, she passed away.

0:10:07.880,0:10:16.780
My sister took me when I was aged nine to help her in the house.

0:10:16.780,0:10:22.020
She introduced me to church; so, I started going to Sunday school.

0:10:22.020,0:10:29.080
By the grace of God, that church announced that there were people who would support

0:10:29.080,0:10:33.140
poor children who could not go to school.

0:10:33.140,0:10:39.940
By that time, I was nine years and I had never entered any school.

0:10:39.940,0:10:54.160
So, I agreed, wrote my name and was lucky to get the opportunity to go to school.

0:10:54.160,0:11:03.040
In school, because of my age, they could not take me to standard 1 or 2 but straight to class 4.

0:11:03.040,0:11:09.700
The people from class 4 knew how to read and write and speak English.

0:11:09.700,0:11:15.700
It was hard for me; I didn't know what to do in that class.

0:11:15.700,0:11:18.320
So what about you? Were you able to read, write and speak English?

0:11:18.320,0:11:24.620
No! I could not even say the alphabet.

0:11:24.620,0:11:30.020
It was so hard because those people could write very well.

0:11:30.020,0:11:34.100
I was so stressed and depressed.

0:11:34.100,0:11:41.780
Then, after one year, I went to the next class which was even harder.

0:11:41.780,0:11:46.780
Then, I went to another class - it was harder and harder.

0:11:46.780,0:11:54.100
So, when I went to class 7, it became like 'hell'. I could not cope any longer.

0:11:54.100,0:12:05.560
The depression was too much because you can even get a good job with reaching class 7.

0:12:05.560,0:12:07.400
I got tired.

0:12:07.400,0:12:09.520
I said to myself, "What kind of life is this!"

0:12:09.520,0:12:13.280
I met two women who introduced me to drinking.

0:12:13.280,0:12:18.700
I was drinking while going to school and the teacher noticed that I was drinking.

0:12:18.700,0:12:24.600
I stopped going to school because I could not catch anything.

0:12:24.600,0:12:27.560
I told my sister that I cannot continue going to school.

0:12:27.560,0:12:29.340
I started drinking.

0:12:29.340,0:12:32.620
Every day, I would drink and would come back home drunk.

0:12:32.620,0:12:39.240
My sister would beat me every day and get annoyed with me because I would be drunk.

0:12:39.240,0:12:47.980
I could not afford beer; so, I bought the cheap one that could kill people in Kenya.

0:12:47.980,0:12:51.140
At what age did you start taking alcohol?

0:12:51.140,0:12:54.280
I was maybe 15 years old.

0:12:54.280,0:12:57.440
Each time you took alcohol, what would happen to you?

0:12:57.440,0:13:05.460
I would fight and because it was very strong, I would drink quickly before the police came

0:13:05.460,0:13:07.620
and would blackout at anytime.

0:13:07.620,0:13:10.260
They would carry me and tell my sister,

0:13:10.260,0:13:15.580
"Your sister is in the garbage; she cannot walk".

0:13:15.580,0:13:22.920
So, people would carry me and bring me home and wash me without me knowing.

0:13:22.920,0:13:31.560
It continued like that. My sister got tired of me and I got tired of being beaten every day.

0:13:31.560,0:13:40.800
My sister told me, "You can move out and go and look for your own life. I'm tired!"

0:13:40.800,0:13:45.180
So, I went to those people who I used to drink with.

0:13:45.180,0:13:59.120
I met one man and told him, "Please, I don't have anywhere to go. Can I stay with you?"

0:13:59.120,0:14:02.800
So you mean that by this time, your elder sister had driven you out of the house

0:14:02.800,0:14:04.580
because she was tired of you?

0:14:04.580,0:14:06.580
Yes.

0:14:06.580,0:14:14.840
I started staying with the man as girlfriend and boyfriend.

0:14:14.840,0:14:24.600
I didn't know he was a gangster. I mean, an armed robber.

0:14:24.600,0:14:28.300
I knew it late but I didn't know where to go.

0:14:28.300,0:14:29.640
I stayed with him.

0:14:29.640,0:14:33.140
I said, "Anything can happen; I don't care because I don't know where to go".

0:14:33.140,0:14:38.200
One day, when we were living together, things became harder and harder

0:14:38.200,0:14:41.440
and he could not even afford to pay the rent.

0:14:41.440,0:14:45.900
So, the landlord told us, "Now, you can move out of my house

0:14:45.900,0:14:49.660
because you cannot pay the rent anymore".

0:14:49.660,0:14:58.140
So, we moved out and asked to stay with one of his friends who was also an armed robber

0:14:58.140,0:15:02.940
and he had two girlfriends.

0:15:02.940,0:15:12.020
After moving to his friend's house, they would go for three days and not come back.

0:15:12.020,0:15:15.660
We didn't have anything to eat for three days.

0:15:15.660,0:15:19.140
One day, he came back with the girlfriend.

0:15:19.140,0:15:23.420
Myself and another girlfriend were in the house for three days - no food!

0:15:23.420,0:15:29.880
So, they came and carried something but we didn't konw that it was money.

0:15:29.880,0:15:36.380
Afterwards, I told the one who I was always with in the house when they went out

0:15:36.380,0:15:45.060
that she should go and peep to see what her husband was doing with another woman.

0:15:45.060,0:15:51.380
So, she went and peeped through the door and told me, "Come here! They are counting money".

0:15:51.380,0:15:56.240
I responded, "Really?" She said, "Yes". I said that I would watch.

0:15:56.240,0:16:01.300
I watched and concluded that it was true - a lot of money.

0:16:01.300,0:16:05.840
We kept quiet and pretended that we didn't see any money.

0:16:05.840,0:16:11.520
Afterwards, they left, locked the door and left the money.

0:16:11.520,0:16:17.140
So, you mean that was part of the money they went and robbed?

0:16:17.140,0:16:19.220
Or stealing - I don't know. Yes.

0:16:19.220,0:16:20.420
They brought the money home?

0:16:20.420,0:16:21.520
Yes.

0:16:21.520,0:16:22.700
Ok.

0:16:22.700,0:16:30.360
I suggested to her, "Look, sister! We should break inside that house".

0:16:30.360,0:16:32.360
But we didn't know how to do it.

0:16:32.360,0:16:37.160
I told one man that I had lost my key and then he broke the lock of the door.

0:16:37.160,0:16:42.280
Then, we took the money and ran away.

0:16:42.280,0:16:46.520

Deliverance Testimony

0:16:46.520,0:16:52.620
So you mean that you and the other man's girlfriend carried all the money?

0:16:52.620,0:16:56.040
Yes, all the money.

0:16:56.040,0:17:06.540
We ran away to another town where nobody knew us.

0:17:06.540,0:17:11.520
We stayed there, went shopping, bought clothes, had our hair done,

0:17:11.520,0:17:14.860
bought shoes and became new people.

0:17:14.860,0:17:19.100
If you saw us, you would not recognise that we were the ones.

0:17:19.100,0:17:23.300
I went back to my sister and the lady went back to her village.

0:17:23.300,0:17:27.880
When I went back to my sister, she could not recognise me and asked, "Are you the one?"

0:17:27.880,0:17:34.140
I replied, "Yes, I'm your sister".

0:17:34.140,0:17:37.740
She told me, "Welcome back".

0:17:37.740,0:17:43.300
I told her how I managed to get the money.

0:17:43.300,0:17:46.460
I also gave her some money to buy me a small plot of land.

0:17:46.460,0:17:50.880
She told me to go to the city, that I should not stay there

0:17:50.880,0:17:54.520
because those people may look for me.

0:17:54.520,0:18:03.760
The police was also looking for those armed robbers.

0:18:03.760,0:18:13.140
Those armed robbers were looking for us.

0:18:13.140,0:18:21.260
Ok. You mean that police men were looking for them because of the robbery

0:18:21.260,0:18:24.320
and they were also looking for you because of their money you took away?

0:18:24.320,0:18:26.320
Yes.

0:18:26.320,0:18:30.640
So, tell us - how did you get into this life of prostitution after this?

0:18:30.640,0:18:42.740
After that, I went to Nairobi; my sister introduced me to a big international club.

0:18:42.740,0:18:52.280
In that club were foreigners and tourists from many countries.

0:18:52.280,0:18:57.480
I met a Japanese man from that club.

0:18:57.480,0:19:01.060
That time, I could not even speak English.

0:19:01.060,0:19:03.680
He asked me what he could help me with.

0:19:03.680,0:19:08.100
I asked the Japanese man to take me to where they have English classes.

0:19:08.100,0:19:13.480
He agreed to it and I started class.

0:19:13.480,0:19:17.840
After two months, the evil spirit came and chased the man away -

0:19:17.840,0:19:22.760
I took a knife and chased the Japanese man away.

0:19:22.760,0:19:28.820
That was how my English class ended.

0:19:28.820,0:19:32.760
I went back to prostitution - the same club.

0:19:32.760,0:19:37.560
I met another Japanese man who told me to stay at home,

0:19:37.560,0:19:44.120
that he would pay for everything I wanted and that he needed me to have a baby for him.

0:19:44.120,0:19:45.820
I didn't know he was married.

0:19:45.820,0:19:52.100
It was after I became pregnant that I discovered he was a married man.

0:19:52.100,0:19:59.380
After getting the baby, somebody called him that he was not supposed to work in Nairobi anymore,

0:19:59.380,0:20:01.160
that he had to go back to Japan.

0:20:01.160,0:20:06.120
He left me like that - no more contact.

0:20:06.120,0:20:14.460
I went back to prostitution and met another Japanese man.

0:20:14.460,0:20:18.540
So how many Japanese men were this now?

0:20:18.540,0:20:19.880
Three Japanese men.

0:20:19.880,0:20:20.980
The third one now?

0:20:20.980,0:20:21.500
Yes.

0:20:21.500,0:20:22.400
Ok. Then what happened?

0:20:22.400,0:20:29.400
That Japanese man was a divorcee but was ready to marry me.

0:20:29.400,0:20:34.380
He told me that he accepted me with my first baby.

0:20:34.380,0:20:38.380
We stayed in Kenya for two years and then we went to Japan.

0:20:38.380,0:20:44.120
After five or six years, I started beating him.

0:20:44.120,0:20:45.140
In his own country?

0:20:45.140,0:20:45.980
Yes.

0:20:45.980,0:20:48.900
Bahati
Deliverance Testimony

0:20:48.900,0:20:54.520
So what happened when you started beating him?

0:20:54.520,0:20:58.060
After a while, I thought to myself that one day, I would kill this man

0:20:58.060,0:21:02.540
and then I will be taken to jail, that led me to divorce him.

0:21:02.540,0:21:06.120
So, I went through the process of divorce.

0:21:06.120,0:21:11.520
After coming back, I told him to sign but he refused.

0:21:11.520,0:21:16.520
Then, I took a knife and told him, "If you don't sign, I'm going to kill you".

0:21:16.520,0:21:18.520
So, he signed the divorce paper

0:21:18.520,0:21:25.520
and I looked for two men from Japan and slept with these men to sign for me too.

0:21:25.520,0:21:32.600
That was how I divorced my husband and the government took me.

0:21:32.600,0:21:36.480
Where the government took me to, there was a limited time...

0:21:36.480,0:21:39.380
So by this time, you had a child with this man?

0:21:39.380,0:21:43.440
Yes, I had another child - with the husband I divorced.

0:21:43.440,0:21:44.820
So making how many children now?

0:21:44.820,0:21:45.840
Two.

0:21:45.840,0:21:47.160
With two Japanese men?

0:21:47.160,0:21:47.900
Yes.

0:21:47.900,0:21:50.800
Ok. Go ahead.

0:21:50.800,0:21:54.980
When the government took me, at that place, there was a limit;

0:21:54.980,0:22:00.640
so, I could not go out at night and come back in the morning or over-drink

0:22:00.640,0:22:03.180
because it was strict.

0:22:03.180,0:22:06.100
So, you mean that you were now put in a restricted area?

0:22:06.100,0:22:06.600
Yes.

0:22:06.600,0:22:09.300
The government was taking care of you people - you had no chance to go out,

0:22:09.300,0:22:11.120
drink and go to the clubhouse?

0:22:11.120,0:22:12.380
Yes.

0:22:12.380,0:22:17.200
I stayed there for one year. I was stressed because I could not go out.

0:22:17.200,0:22:20.820
One day, I got my own house and freedom.

0:22:20.820,0:22:28.640
That was when I started drinking every day, from morning to morning,

0:22:28.640,0:22:33.960
leaving my children alone.

0:22:33.960,0:22:38.260
So, you mean that by this time, your two children were living with you

0:22:38.260,0:22:40.900
and you could not take care of them?

0:22:40.900,0:22:41.520
Yes.

0:22:41.520,0:22:44.660
So, when you were going out to drink and go to the clubhouse to meet men,

0:22:44.660,0:22:46.300
who would you leave your children with?

0:22:46.300,0:22:48.940
I used to leave them alone.

0:22:48.940,0:22:49.680
In the house?

0:22:49.680,0:22:50.800
Yes.

0:22:50.800,0:22:55.320
When I would come in the morning, I would start crying, asking myself why

0:22:55.320,0:22:59.820
and what had happened in my life.

0:22:59.820,0:23:02.280
That was how I was suffering.

0:23:02.280,0:23:06.060
Bahati - Deliverance Testimony

0:23:06.060,0:23:10.140
Ok. So how old were these children then?

0:23:10.140,0:23:17.160
My eldest child is 13 and the other one is seven years old.

0:23:17.160,0:23:24.180
After getting my apartment, I met this Japanese lady.

0:23:24.180,0:23:28.960
She was married to an African man.

0:23:28.960,0:23:35.160
That woman said, "Ah, you have so much stress. Let me introduce you to idol worship".

0:23:35.160,0:23:40.180
I told her, "No, I cannot worship idols; I am a Christian".

0:23:40.180,0:23:44.480
She continued disturbing me for almost two years.

0:23:44.480,0:23:52.180
One day - because she was married to a black man - I decided to face the husband

0:23:52.180,0:23:56.520
to stop this woman from disturbing me.

0:23:56.520,0:23:59.800
So, I met with the husband.

0:23:59.800,0:24:04.420
He became my boyfriend and now, I am pregnant by him.

0:24:04.420,0:24:08.380
Bahati
Deliverance Testimony

0:24:08.380,0:24:15.620
So you mean the African man you met where you are living?

0:24:15.620,0:24:16.780
Yes, my neighbour.

0:24:16.780,0:24:18.160
Who is married to a Japanese woman?

0:24:18.160,0:24:19.340
Yes, they are my neighbours.

0:24:19.340,0:24:24.120
So when you went to him because you didn't want to worship idols with the wife...

0:24:24.120,0:24:25.680
Yes, so I didn't know...

0:24:25.680,0:24:28.100
So you went to the husband for him to talk to the wife

0:24:28.100,0:24:29.420
so that she would stop disturbing you?

0:24:29.420,0:24:29.920
Yes.

0:24:29.920,0:24:31.780
And you became friends - boyfriend and girlfriend?

0:24:31.780,0:24:32.700
Yes.

0:24:32.700,0:24:35.800
So the pregnancy you have now is for who?

0:24:35.800,0:24:38.080
It's for him.

0:24:38.080,0:24:40.080
So did the wife know about it?

0:24:40.080,0:24:45.140
I told the wife that I was pregnant by her husband.

0:24:45.140,0:24:46.900
And what did she say?

0:24:46.900,0:24:51.600
She asked me what I was going to do and if I would have an abortion or what.

0:24:51.600,0:24:54.660
I said, "No", that I was a Christian and would not have an abortion

0:24:54.660,0:25:01.040
but that I didn't need anything from her - God would provide for the baby.

0:25:01.040,0:25:11.680
She complained that the husband was down and that the money was not coming in like before.

0:25:11.680,0:25:16.320
So, the two children you had with those two Japanese men - where are they now?

0:25:16.320,0:25:17.960
They are in Japan.

0:25:17.960,0:25:20.520
Tell us how you came to know about The SCOAN.

0:25:20.520,0:25:25.620
There is a Kenyan woman who lives in Japan.

0:25:25.620,0:25:28.780
She introduced me to Emmanuel TV.

0:25:28.780,0:25:35.980
Then I started watching and saw people with similar problems to mine.

0:25:35.980,0:25:41.220
I continued watching.

0:25:41.220,0:25:46.000
Last week, I got my complete deliverance, in Jesus' name.

0:25:46.000,0:25:48.860
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus!

0:25:48.860,0:25:52.960
Bahati
Deliverance Testimony

0:25:52.960,0:26:00.480
A while ago, we watched the deliverance and heard all that the demon said.

0:26:00.480,0:26:03.880
Can you tell us - what was your experience at that point in time

0:26:03.880,0:26:07.880
when the Morning Water was ministered to you? What were the things you saw?

0:26:07.880,0:26:11.000
That time, the anger was much.

0:26:11.000,0:26:13.420
If I had caught the evangelist at that time,

0:26:13.420,0:26:19.980
maybe, I could have killed her because I was so angry but it was not me.

0:26:19.980,0:26:24.960
I didn't know what made me so angry and so powerful.

0:26:24.960,0:26:28.340
So all this while, you didn't know that all the life you were living,

0:26:28.340,0:26:32.900
it was as a result of these demons - the spiritual husband and the snake?

0:26:32.900,0:26:38.720
I didn't know until I started watching Emmanuel TV and witnessed people's testimonies.

0:26:38.720,0:26:42.260
Then, I saw similar problems to mine.

0:26:42.260,0:26:47.100
I said to myself, "Yes, I think I have the same problem as this woman".

0:26:47.100,0:26:54.360
I trust and love God and said that I would never let Him go.

0:26:54.360,0:26:56.800
What was in that Morning Water that was ministered to you

0:26:56.800,0:27:01.540
that would make you lose your temper - you felt like fighting and destroying?

0:27:01.540,0:27:06.460
I don't know. It was the spirit within me.

0:27:06.460,0:27:11.140
My character changed and I became violent.

0:27:11.140,0:27:16.020
Ok. Since after your deliverance, can you tell us of the changes you have noticed in your life.

0:27:16.020,0:27:18.080
I feel light in my body.

0:27:18.080,0:27:27.240
My stomach used to feel heavy as if I were carrying many babies.

0:27:27.240,0:27:34.960
I could not sleep on my left side but now, I can - even for two hours.

0:27:34.960,0:27:37.160
I also used to eat a lot.

0:27:37.160,0:27:42.600
Do you still have the urge to go out to the clubhouse and meet men?

0:27:42.600,0:27:44.300
You have been here for the whole week.

0:27:44.300,0:27:46.440
Do you still have the urge to go out and meet men?

0:27:46.440,0:27:49.560
No, I am totally delivered.

what is your word of advice to people that are listening to you all over the world

0:28:02.240,0:28:05.100
and people who are still living the kind of life you lived in the past?

0:28:05.100,0:28:07.520
What advice do you have for them?

0:28:07.520,0:28:11.000
My advice to the whole world is to never give up on God.

0:28:11.000,0:28:12.660
Come close to Him.

0:28:12.660,0:28:18.240
He will deliver you the way He delivered me and your past shall be over.

0:28:18.240,0:28:18.920
Amen.

0:28:18.920,0:28:20.080
Don't struggle outside.

0:28:20.080,0:28:24.460
Hallelujah! Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

0:28:24.460,0:28:29.800
Indeed, it is only by deliverance that our past can be over.

0:28:29.800,0:28:36.060
So, remember, the former life you were living was a life out there in the world.

0:28:36.060,0:28:39.120
It is now that you are delivered - now you are Christian,

0:28:39.120,0:28:41.940
now you are a born-again, now you are a believer.

0:28:41.940,0:28:47.140
I want to encourage you to make the Word of God the standard for your life

0:28:47.140,0:28:52.580
and embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change.

0:28:52.580,0:28:57.420
Through this deliverance, your life will be restored and you will come back some day

0:28:57.420,0:29:02.140
to give a wonderful testimony of breakthrough and blessing in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:29:02.140,0:29:03.140
Amen!
