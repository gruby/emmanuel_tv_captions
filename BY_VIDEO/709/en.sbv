The footage your are about to watch is of a sensitive nature

0:00:04.100,0:00:09.580
and may not be suitable for all viewers but it is for the glory of God.

0:00:09.580,0:00:14.300
58 year-old Mr Omotosho Kareem, from Oyo State, Nigeria,

0:00:14.300,0:00:20.180
has come to The SCOAN with the deadly problem of throat cancer.

0:00:20.180,0:00:24.300
This is the medical report from Lagos University Teaching Hospital,

0:00:24.300,0:00:27.440
showing the diagnosis of his ailment.

0:00:27.440,0:00:31.260
Imagine how this problem has affected his daily life,

0:00:31.260,0:00:36.920
not being able to eat or speak, and the terrible odour that would be coming out of his mouth.

0:00:36.920,0:00:43.280
He has come to The SCOAN with the belief that Jesus Christ can supernaturally heal him

0:00:43.280,0:00:46.440
and bring life in abundance.

0:00:46.440,0:00:50.120
The camera zooms into Omotoshu Kareem's mouth,

0:00:50.120,0:00:53.420
showing a severe spreading of the throat cancer,

0:00:53.420,0:00:58.220
and swelling to the extent that it has closed the passage of his mouth.

0:00:58.220,0:00:59.900
The pain is unbearable.

0:00:59.900,0:01:04.360
Only a divine touch from Jesus Christ can reverse this problem.

0:01:04.360,0:01:10.880
Mr Omotosho Kareem awaits at the prayer line in hope for Jesus Christ to divinely come to his aid

0:01:10.880,0:01:13.780
and rescue him from the claws of sickness.

0:01:13.780,0:01:18.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ

0:01:18.060,0:01:20.260
and the power of healing falls upon him

0:01:20.260,0:01:23.320
and breaks the yoke of throat cancer in his life.

0:01:23.320,0:01:27.900
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:27.900,0:01:31.360
Praise the Lord!

0:01:31.360,0:01:35.480
Praise the Living Jesus!

0:01:35.480,0:01:39.500
My name is Mr Kareem Omotosho.

0:01:39.500,0:01:52.500
I came to The SCOAN to thank God for what He has done in my life.

0:01:52.500,0:02:01.760
If not for the God of T.B. Joshua, I would not have been able to talk like this.

0:02:01.760,0:02:05.400
I would have joined them in the graveyard.

0:02:05.400,0:02:17.300
Back in December 2015, it started as if a small bone got stuck in my throat.

0:02:17.300,0:02:20.800
I started running from one place to another.

0:02:20.800,0:02:28.600
I went to many hospitals, including Lagos University Teaching Hospital.

0:02:28.600,0:02:39.340
When I got there, they diagnosed it and told me that it was cancer of the throat and mouth.

0:02:39.340,0:02:44.840
I said, "Wow, what will I do?"

0:02:44.840,0:02:55.720
One day, I was at the doctor, and he told me that this growth was fast growing

0:02:55.720,0:03:03.340
and that they had no option than to operate on my throat and insert a pipe.

0:03:03.340,0:03:10.940
They had to do it because I couldn't use my mouth to do anything.

0:03:10.940,0:03:16.900
I went home and decided that I have to come to The SCOAN.

0:03:16.900,0:03:22.960
At that time, what were the things you could no longer do with your mouth? Were you able to talk?

0:03:22.960,0:03:25.920
How difficult was it at that time?

0:03:25.920,0:03:29.420
I could not eat anything or swallow.

0:03:29.420,0:03:35.860
I could only take watery pap ( liquid food).

0:03:35.860,0:03:37.300
Were you able to talk?

0:03:37.300,0:03:41.700
I couldn't talk. I even smelt bad.

0:03:41.700,0:03:50.380
When I entered a bus, people would complain that something was smelling.

0:03:50.380,0:03:54.960
They would say, "Who brought something rotten?"

0:03:54.960,0:03:59.760
When I entered a bus, I would sit by the window,

0:03:59.760,0:04:06.640
so I could put my mouth outside because of the smell.

0:04:06.640,0:04:20.620
Many people rejected me because they knew, and even I knew that I was going to die.

0:04:20.620,0:04:27.500
There was no way out; I vomited blood every day.

0:04:27.500,0:04:31.920
I then decided to come to The SCOAN.

0:04:31.920,0:04:34.980
I thank the God of T.B. Joshua.

0:04:34.980,0:04:42.360
When I was placed on the prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.

0:04:42.360,0:04:52.000
Instantly, the saliva that had been uncontrollable stopped.

0:04:52.000,0:04:57.760
Shall we put out hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:04:57.760,0:05:02.560
Before you came to The SCOAN to receive prayer from the man of God,

0:05:02.560,0:05:07.680
Prophet TB Joshua, at the prayer line, you were constantly dropping saliva uncontrollably?

0:05:07.680,0:05:15.140
I always carried a towel with me because it was uncontrollable. I tried to control it, but couldn't.

0:05:15.140,0:05:19.780
It came out like water every minute.

0:05:19.780,0:05:24.860
The first thing that happened to me - the saliva stopped.

0:05:24.860,0:05:28.380
My body calmed down.

0:05:28.380,0:05:36.880
I thought that pieces of the meat (tumour) would come out but instead it melted away.

0:05:36.880,0:05:42.260
I didn't see it any longer. That's how the cancer disappeared from my life.

0:05:42.260,0:05:44.100
Hallelujah!

0:05:44.100,0:05:45.940
We can see you talking now.

0:05:45.940,0:05:48.580
So you mean you could not even express yourself?

0:05:48.580,0:05:50.120
I couldn't.

0:05:50.120,0:05:56.860
If I wanted to communicate to anyone around, I had to write it on a piece of paper.

0:05:56.860,0:05:58.820
I couldn't talk.

0:05:58.820,0:06:00.960
And all the pain you used to have?-

0:06:00.960,0:06:03.940
It was not a small pain.

0:06:03.940,0:06:08.040
What you watched - you would understand what I am saying.

0:06:08.040,0:06:12.820
The pain was so much I couldn't control it.

0:06:12.820,0:06:17.060
I thank God today that everything (cancer) is over in my life.

0:06:17.060,0:06:19.080
See the left side of the screen.

0:06:19.080,0:06:24.000
See how terrible it was. It was spreading from inside the mouth down to the throat.

0:06:24.000,0:06:27.000
He could no longer do things for himself.

0:06:27.000,0:06:29.320
Eating was a problem, he could not talk.

0:06:29.320,0:06:31.840
Pain and the agony day and night.

0:06:31.840,0:06:36.060
He said that when he was placed at the prayer line, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:06:36.060,0:06:39.740
prayed for him, as you can see on the left side of the screen. That's the same man.

0:06:39.740,0:06:44.480
After the prayer by the man of God, he was completely set free.

0:06:44.480,0:06:48.100
Right now, can you open your mouth and let us see?

0:06:48.100,0:06:49.460
Wow!

0:06:49.460,0:06:51.880
Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer

0:06:51.880,0:06:55.200
Once again, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:55.200,0:06:58.820
Before and After

0:06:58.820,0:07:04.480
Look at the left side of your screen - that was his condition when he first came to The SCOAN.

0:07:04.480,0:07:08.400
Right now on the right side of the screen, you can see his testimony.

0:07:08.400,0:07:11.200
All the cancerous growth is gone.

0:07:11.200,0:07:14.500
Now his mouth is normal and his throat is free of cancer.

0:07:14.500,0:07:16.640
Now you can eat very well?

0:07:16.640,0:07:19.540
I can eat, I can do anything.

0:07:19.540,0:07:25.960
Once again, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:07:25.960,0:07:35.320
People all over the world and the people that are here - in any situation you find yourself,

0:07:35.320,0:07:43.820
please run to God because it is only in God that you can find hope.

0:07:43.820,0:07:45.980
I had lost hope.

0:07:45.980,0:07:49.800
My family had said that they wanted to take me to the village.

0:07:49.800,0:07:56.980
They knew it would be cheaper to put me in a vehicle to take me to my village

0:07:56.980,0:08:00.340
than dying here and then take me to my village.

0:08:00.340,0:08:03.020
So they wanted to take me there.

0:08:03.020,0:08:08.540
If not that I ran to God, what would I have done?

0:08:08.540,0:08:14.360
In any situation, problem, just run to God and you will be saved.

0:08:14.360,0:08:19.240
Thank You, Jesus!

0:08:19.240,0:08:21.640
To God be the glory! Watch your screen!

0:08:21.640,0:08:27.900
Viewers out there, you can see the comparison between the shot on the left side of the screen

0:08:27.900,0:08:29.720
and on the right side of the Screen.

0:08:29.720,0:08:34.300
This man testified that no one around him believed that he would survive.

0:08:34.300,0:08:39.420
He himself had the thought and the belief in his heart that he was going to die

0:08:39.420,0:08:44.960
because he was no longer functioning like someone living in the land of the living.

0:08:44.960,0:08:51.200
Glory be to God, he came to the right place, at the right time and met the right person -

0:08:51.200,0:08:57.120
the anointed Prophet of God who waved his hand towards him and the miracle happened.

0:08:57.120,0:08:59.680
Now, he is alive today to share that testimony.

0:08:59.680,0:09:02.140
Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:09:02.140,0:11:23.140
Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer

0:11:23.140,0:11:36.460
My advice to the whole world is that when there is a problem, don't look at people.

0:11:36.460,0:11:42.200
Just run to God because Jesus Christ is the only hope.

0:11:42.200,0:11:45.020
So, please run to God.

0:11:45.020,0:11:47.740
Jesus Christ is the only hope.

0:11:47.740,0:11:53.960
The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the answer to all fundamental issues of life -

0:11:53.960,0:11:59.300
be it sickness, setback, poverty, failure, barrenness.

0:11:59.300,0:12:04.080
Whatever it is, run to Jesus and you will receive a solution.

0:12:04.080,0:12:05.640
We thank God Almighty for your life.

0:12:05.640,0:12:10.500
We also want to encourage you that the healing you have received is for the salvation of your soul.

0:12:10.500,0:12:15.800
The only way you can maintain this healing is to make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:12:15.800,0:12:20.200
We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make God's Word the standard of your life,

0:12:20.200,0:12:21.460
in Jesus' name!

0:12:21.460,0:12:22.540
Amen.

0:12:22.540,0:12:25.460
Thank you. Once again, put your hands together for Jesus!

0:12:30.820,0:12:37.280
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:12:37.280,0:12:43.100
I want to take up the issue of the gentleman who testified here.

0:12:43.100,0:12:50.020
With the case of cancer. I want us to look again at that case.

0:12:50.020,0:12:56.080
If cancer on any part of the body remains uncured,

0:12:56.080,0:13:04.340
how can you manage the one on the tongue that would not have the grace to enjoy the air.

0:13:04.340,0:13:11.600
You understand that when something somewhere is bleeding, it's always difficult to cure

0:13:11.600,0:13:16.440
because air is healing; you can take it up.

0:13:16.440,0:13:19.300
He did not have grace for the air

0:13:19.300,0:13:25.380
but he is cured by mere waving hand.

0:13:25.380,0:13:27.500
Your situation will be cured!

0:13:27.500,0:13:29.460
Amen!

0:13:29.460,0:13:31.320
Your situation is cured!

0:13:31.320,0:13:33.020
Amen!

0:13:33.020,0:13:37.060
If you have that faith, take one - your situation will be cured!

0:13:37.060,0:13:38.440
Amen!

0:13:38.440,0:13:40.080
Your situation is cured!

0:13:40.080,0:13:42.200
Amen!

0:13:42.200,0:13:47.560
Which one is yours?

0:13:47.560,0:13:49.620
Your situation will be cured!

0:13:49.620,0:13:51.320
Amen!

0:13:51.320,0:13:53.140
Your situation is cured!

0:13:53.140,0:13:55.300
Amen!

0:13:55.300,0:13:57.740
You can't claim the two.

0:13:57.740,0:14:00.500
You can't belong to the two.

0:14:00.500,0:14:02.700
You belong to one.

0:14:02.700,0:14:09.500
You have to stand up now. Let me know the one you are waiting for.

0:14:09.500,0:14:14.760
If you stand up, when the situation is not yours, you sit down.

0:14:14.760,0:14:19.440
When the situation is yours, you stand up.

0:14:19.440,0:14:21.520
Your situation will be cured!

0:14:21.520,0:14:23.460
Amen!

0:14:23.460,0:14:25.360
Your situation is cured!

0:14:25.360,0:14:27.360
Amen!

0:14:27.360,0:14:38.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:38.500,0:14:40.720
You may be seated. Let's watch!

0:14:40.720,0:14:43.380
Mr Omotosho Kareem awaits at the prayer line

0:14:43.380,0:14:46.840
in hope for Jesus Christ to divinely come to his aid

0:14:46.840,0:14:49.720
and rescue him from the claws of sickness.

0:14:49.720,0:14:53.620
Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:14:53.620,0:14:56.080
and the power of healing falls upon him

0:14:56.080,0:15:00.840
and breaks the yoke of throat cancer in his life.

0:15:00.840,0:15:02.940
You can see it clear.

0:15:02.940,0:15:05.000
Can you see it clear ?

0:15:05.000,0:15:10.020
This is the kind of thing you are supposed to put on your phone

0:15:10.020,0:15:14.000
and that will enhance your faith.

0:15:14.000,0:15:16.000
Before and After

0:15:16.000,0:15:21.260
Any time you are disturbed, you woud remember the Healer.

0:15:21.260,0:15:30.840
There is a time to be disturbed, and a time to be happy.

0:15:30.840,0:15:33.320
A time to be what? - (disturbed)

0:15:33.320,0:15:35.280
And a time to be what? - (happy)

0:15:35.280,0:15:40.640
Yes, any time you are disturbed, you play it to yourself

0:15:40.640,0:15:47.120
so that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.

0:15:47.120,0:15:48.220
Tell your neighbour:

0:15:48.220,0:15:56.220
So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.

0:15:56.220,0:15:57.520
Tell your neighbor again:

0:15:57.520,0:16:01.640
So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.

0:16:01.640,0:16:03.020
I can't hear you.

0:16:03.020,0:16:06.400
So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.

0:16:06.400,0:16:07.540
Again !

0:16:07.540,0:16:11.180
So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.

0:16:11.180,0:16:13.220
It's only like that, you see me...

0:16:13.220,0:16:15.480
Can you see?

0:16:15.480,0:16:16.880
Hard

0:16:16.880,0:16:18.820
Good

0:16:18.820,0:16:20.180
Hard

0:16:20.180,0:16:20.880
Good

0:16:20.880,0:16:23.240
Good and Hard

0:16:23.240,0:16:31.480
Don't say, until you have pain in your leg, before you realise that you are going through good and hard times.

0:16:31.480,0:16:34.820
Don't say, until there is no money in the pocket,

0:16:34.820,0:16:41.100
before you recognise that you are going through hard and good times.

0:16:41.100,0:16:45.940
Don't say, until you have no food on the table,

0:16:45.940,0:16:52.060
before you recognise that life is all about hard and good moments.

0:16:52.060,0:16:52.900
Tell your neighbour:

0:16:52.900,0:17:00.100
Life is all about hard and good moments.

0:17:00.100,0:17:01.320
I can't hear you!

0:17:01.320,0:17:04.580
Life is all about hard and good moments.

0:17:04.580,0:17:05.400
Again!

0:17:05.400,0:17:08.620
Life is all about hard and good moments.

0:17:08.620,0:17:10.080
How do we know this?

0:17:10.080,0:17:14.320
We know this through the thoughts in our hearts.

0:17:14.320,0:17:18.520
There is a conflict going on.

0:17:18.520,0:17:22.220
There is a conflict going on in your heart.

0:17:22.220,0:17:28.200
As you are sitting down, there is a conflict going on in your heart.

0:17:28.200,0:17:30.080
"No", "yes".

0:17:30.080,0:17:31.720
"Ok, let me go!"

0:17:31.720,0:17:34.060
"When it is 12 o'clock, I will leave!"

0:17:34.060,0:17:37.980
The thought of your heart.

0:17:37.980,0:17:42.600
You know your heart is a prayer room.

0:17:42.600,0:17:43.600
Tell your neighbour:

0:17:43.600,0:17:47.980
A Christian's heart is a prayer room.

0:17:47.980,0:17:51.820
A believer's heart is a prayer room.

0:17:51.820,0:17:56.380
It is a prayer room; that is the altar.

0:17:56.380,0:18:02.260
If your prayer is not from that place, whatever you are saying, you are deceiving yourself.

0:18:02.260,0:18:08.380
The prayer must come from the altar, prayer room.

0:18:08.380,0:18:18.980
If your prayer is not from your heart, you are just talking to the air.

0:18:18.980,0:18:22.900
This is why you doubt yourself because what you are saying is not from your heart.

0:18:22.900,0:18:25.160
You are bound to doubt yourself.

0:18:25.160,0:18:28.020
"In the name of Jesus, heal me!"

0:18:28.020,0:18:31.840
The doubt comes when you are not healed because that prayer is not from your heart.

0:18:31.840,0:18:38.320
If your prayer comes from the prayer room - the heart - you cannot doubt yourself.

0:18:38.320,0:18:40.340
You would believe!

0:18:40.340,0:18:46.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:46.040,0:18:47.700
Am I talking to you?

0:18:47.700,0:18:51.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:51.140,0:19:00.200
A believer's heart is the prayer room.

0:19:00.200,0:19:02.440
So, you keep doubting yourself.

0:19:02.440,0:19:06.080
Anytime you take a decision, doubt comes -

0:19:06.080,0:19:08.360
whether to do it or not to do it;

0:19:08.360,0:19:10.980
whether to pay the money or not to pay the money.

0:19:10.980,0:19:12.280
You get confused.

0:19:12.280,0:19:15.420
It's about the decision; it's about doubt.

0:19:15.420,0:19:18.300
When it's about decision, doubt comes

0:19:18.300,0:19:21.700
because what you are saying is not from your heart.

0:19:21.700,0:19:25.300
Your heart is the prayer room, the altar.

0:19:25.300,0:19:31.080
When the prayer is not from the altar, whatever you are saying, you are saying it to the air.

0:19:31.080,0:19:41.720
That's what we call, saying words, praying prayer.

0:19:41.720,0:19:45.100
So, now..

0:19:45.100,0:19:49.080
Stop measuring your Christian life by your situation.

0:19:49.080,0:19:54.100
In this case, your situation should not mislead you.

0:19:54.100,0:19:58.480
That you are poor does not mean you cannot be a Christian.

0:19:58.480,0:20:02.000
We always attach that, whatever happens to you - sin.

0:20:02.000,0:20:02.640
No!

0:20:02.640,0:20:05.720
Sin also brings reproach - we agree!

0:20:05.720,0:20:12.160
But, sometimes, a situation like this can be used to draw you close (to God).

0:20:12.160,0:20:15.880
You should agree with me that it's your situation that brought you here today.

0:20:15.880,0:20:21.300
If you didn't have that situation, you would have unlikely come here.

0:20:21.300,0:20:29.920
Our situation strengthens our desire and determination for Christ.

0:20:29.920,0:20:32.580
Ok, now.

0:20:32.580,0:20:38.040
You have seen that gentleman, after he has been to many places.

0:20:38.040,0:20:42.320
He has spent all his fortune.

0:20:42.320,0:20:47.820
He could not eat, he could not talk.

0:20:47.820,0:20:54.440
They wanted to operate on him in order to pass the food through the stomach.

0:20:54.440,0:21:00.460
So then, he came to Jesus.

0:21:00.460,0:21:07.760
If there is anything that can draw your attention to Christ most, this is it.

0:21:07.760,0:21:10.180
No amount of message...

0:21:10.180,0:21:15.040
We have many theologians here.

0:21:15.040,0:21:22.660
We have many people that have gone through the Bible many times in a year.

0:21:22.660,0:21:29.260
This is a human being just like you.

0:21:29.260,0:21:34.140
Assume you are in this situation.

0:21:34.140,0:21:39.380
You cannot talk; you cannot eat.

0:21:39.380,0:21:44.380
This had become a curse, it was no longer a sickness.

0:21:44.380,0:21:47.780
There is a difference between sickness and curse.

0:21:47.780,0:21:52.700
If a situation becomes a curse, who can stop the curse?

0:21:52.700,0:21:53.800
Only Jesus.

0:21:53.800,0:21:59.320
Sickness and disease can be treated by human beings, medical doctors,

0:21:59.320,0:22:03.000
you, whatever, tablets, drugs.

0:22:03.000,0:22:08.080
When you take it, if it's sickness, it will be treated.

0:22:08.080,0:22:14.820
This is the meaning of 'Doctor treats; God heals'.

0:22:14.820,0:22:20.180
Sickness demands for treatment.

0:22:20.180,0:22:24.600
Curse demands for healing.

0:22:24.600,0:22:27.500
Who can heal? Only God.

0:22:27.500,0:22:32.580
Doctors can treat - you can treat as a medical doctor.

0:22:32.580,0:22:41.940
This one, the more he is treated, the more the damage.

0:22:41.940,0:22:43.600
Let's see the healing

0:22:43.600,0:22:45.940
before and after.

0:22:45.940,0:22:54.940
Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer

0:22:54.940,0:22:57.720
Before and After

0:22:57.720,0:22:59.160
Can you see?

0:22:59.160,0:23:07.580
So over to you - dentists, doctors; you can meet a man like him.

0:23:07.580,0:23:15.600
Begin to take care of the stitch and wash his tougue.

0:23:15.600,0:23:21.860
Sometimes when our teeth are too bad, it can cause anything.

0:23:21.860,0:23:24.040
Can we ask you - how manage?

0:23:24.040,0:23:33.620
After the healing, the first thing I noticed was that the uncontrollable saliva stopped.

0:23:33.620,0:23:38.560
When you were facing this problem, were you able to eat or talk?

0:23:38.560,0:23:41.000
I could not eat or do anything.

0:23:41.000,0:23:45.940
Even whenever I drank a little bit of water, it felt like fire.

0:23:45.940,0:23:47.340
I could not talk.

0:23:47.340,0:23:48.660
Listen to that.

0:23:48.660,0:23:54.060
What did the doctor tell you before you run to the church?

0:23:54.060,0:23:57.900
They said there was nothing they could do about it.

0:23:57.900,0:24:05.660
They called me and told me that the cancerous growth was growing fast.

0:24:05.660,0:24:11.180
They said they needed to operate on my throat and insert a pipe.

0:24:11.180,0:24:18.920
They noticed that I couldn't breathe well any longer.

0:24:18.920,0:24:24.760
They wanted to operate on my throat and insert a pipe for me to be breathing through.

0:24:24.760,0:24:29.380
After the prayer here, the first day, the second day,

0:24:29.380,0:24:37.740
the first week, the second week, what happened? Can you tell us the procedure, the process?

0:24:37.740,0:24:46.980
After the prayer, the excess saliva stopped and I started seeing changes.

0:24:46.980,0:24:51.100
Everything started drying up.

0:24:51.100,0:25:00.300
Food I could not eat before, I started asking them to give me.

0:25:00.300,0:25:07.300
People around me were surprised that I was eating.

0:25:07.300,0:25:14.680
How the whole thing disappeared, I didn't realise it; it just dried up like that.

0:25:14.680,0:25:20.580
I could not talk before. When I wanted to communicate, I had to write.

0:25:20.580,0:25:23.100
Now, I can talk.
