Good Morning, Church.

0:00:02.480,0:00:07.440
My name is Lucy Atim Hansen.

0:00:07.440,0:00:12.260
I'm originally Ugandan, living in Norway.

0:00:12.260,0:00:25.040
What brought me to The SCOAN was suicidal thoughts and different sorts of pain.

0:00:25.040,0:00:28.820
This all started when I was young.

0:00:28.820,0:00:34.960
When I was a little girl, I was about 2 and a half years old, I had my little sister,

0:00:34.960,0:00:39.980
my mum and my dad; we were four in the house.

0:00:39.980,0:00:47.580
One day, when I was 2 and a half years old, I remember I was sitting with my little sister

0:00:47.580,0:00:53.020
in the living room, playing and my dad was sitting and reading the newspaper.

0:00:53.020,0:01:01.200
My mum came from work, parked her car in the garage and passed through the kitchen.

0:01:01.200,0:01:09.420
From the kitchen, she came through the corridor with a gallon of paraffin.

0:01:09.420,0:01:15.100
I run after her and she told me to go and play with my little sister.

0:01:15.100,0:01:20.460
I went back and sat down and she went down the corridor to her bedroom.

0:01:20.460,0:01:26.480
A few minutes later, I saw smoke coming from the corridor.

0:01:26.480,0:01:33.600
I told my dad that there was smoke in the house but as a child, he didn’t take me seriously

0:01:33.600,0:01:38.160
and just said I should continue playing, that my mum was coming soon.

0:01:38.160,0:01:45.320
The next thing I knew was a scream that I can never forget because

0:01:45.320,0:01:51.060
I was such a little girl and I had never heard anyone scream like that before.

0:01:51.060,0:01:58.080
Those who were outside had already seen the fire through the roof.

0:01:58.080,0:02:07.460
The fire brigade came, the ambulance came and a neighbour came and carried us.

0:02:07.460,0:02:14.240
The biggest mistake she did was to stand there with us because she was curious to see.

0:02:14.240,0:02:20.400
They brought her out of the house; she didn’t have any skin left

0:02:20.400,0:02:32.260
but she was alive, screaming, “John, if I don’t make it, take care of my kids.”

0:02:32.260,0:02:39.500
They took her to hospital and two days later, they took us to see her at the hospital.

0:02:39.500,0:02:47.080
The only thing I knew was to listen to her voice talking, telling us that everything would be OK

0:02:47.080,0:02:53.600
but she was covered in something that I could not see her.

0:02:53.600,0:02:56.900
That was the last time I saw her.

0:02:56.900,0:03:00.160
Two days later, she died and life turned around.

0:03:00.160,0:03:07.660
After my mum died, we moved from that house to another house.

0:03:07.660,0:03:16.260
As a child, I remember that after 6 or 7 months, my dad married a new woman in the house.

0:03:16.260,0:03:24.840
Life became harder and it wasn’t only her that I suffered the rejection and abuse from.

0:03:24.840,0:03:33.820
The whole family rejected us as if the death of our mother was our fault.

0:03:33.820,0:03:41.320
Then, when I was eight years old, I couldn’t take the pain so I ran away from home.

0:03:41.320,0:03:47.540
I went to the missionaries and started working as a dish washer to survive.

0:03:47.540,0:03:54.140
I left my little sister behind and two years after, she died.

0:03:54.140,0:03:57.780
Then it was me and my dad.

0:03:57.780,0:04:00.620
My dad never cared much.

0:04:00.620,0:04:06.720
Maybe he cared but he was scared of people around him.

0:04:06.720,0:04:13.320
I had been accused of each and every thing – that I was a thief, I was the ugly one.

0:04:13.320,0:04:20.960
There is no name in this world that I didn’t get called – different types of names,

0:04:20.960,0:04:29.880
which made me grow up thinking that I was the ugliest child in the world, a thief and a killer.

0:04:29.880,0:04:33.460
With that rejection, I moved on.

0:04:33.460,0:04:36.520
I never went home again.

0:04:36.520,0:04:41.700
From there, I started my own life by working hard.

0:04:41.700,0:04:47.000
I had children after being raped many times.

0:04:47.000,0:04:52.160
I was only four years old and I was raped by a grown up man.

0:04:52.160,0:04:54.200
I couldn’t say it to anybody.

0:04:54.200,0:04:56.900
I lived in the pain and I moved in it

0:04:56.900,0:05:09.340
until my auntie, a friend came with her husband from Norway and he said he wanted to adopt me.

0:05:09.340,0:05:13.880
Sorry, our sister, it is quite a terrible situation and experience;

0:05:13.880,0:05:18.240
before you go any further - could you just tell us, the death of your mum,

0:05:18.240,0:05:23.820
the encounter you had after your father married a new wife,

0:05:23.820,0:05:27.060
and when you were 8 years old, your younger sister died as well -

0:05:27.060,0:05:30.820
with all these terrible circumstances, what happened to you at the end of the day?

0:05:30.820,0:05:43.960
It affected my life mentally – with all this stress and torture, no respect, nobody liked me.

0:05:43.960,0:05:52.700
I developed headaches and could go with these headaches for three months non-stop.

0:05:52.700,0:05:56.640
I didn’t eat and go to the toilet normally.

0:05:56.640,0:06:00.340
I could go for three weeks without going to the toilet.

0:06:00.340,0:06:04.100
I didn’t go to the toilet unless I took tablets.

0:06:04.100,0:06:07.320
Suddenly they said I had a heart problem.

0:06:07.320,0:06:12.260
They took me everywhere, for MRIs I don’t know how many times.

0:06:12.260,0:06:23.760
I had depression and was admitted to hospital and locked up because they said I was crazy.

0:06:23.760,0:06:29.840
There was no treatment and they found a lot of sicknesses in me every day.

0:06:29.840,0:06:33.240
I had migraines every month.

0:06:33.240,0:06:35.080
Even last month, I suffered from migraines.

0:06:35.080,0:06:42.920
I had 40 bottox injections to cool my migraines down.

0:06:42.920,0:06:46.080
I could go for months, day and night.

0:06:46.080,0:06:49.840
When I went to Norway, everything went OK.

0:06:49.840,0:06:52.260
I started to go to school.

0:06:52.260,0:06:55.040
I started to learn very fast.

0:06:55.040,0:07:03.060
I started to get a small job and was working, going to school and earning my pocket money.

0:07:03.060,0:07:08.860
Then, suddenly, my aunt divorced.

0:07:08.860,0:07:16.700
When they were going through the divorce and separation, she left and I had to go with her.

0:07:16.700,0:07:22.880
During that time, I thought I was safe but I wasn’t.

0:07:22.880,0:07:28.520
Mrs Lucy Atim Hansen
Deliverance Testimony

0:07:28.520,0:07:33.020
It is indeed a pathetic situation.

0:07:33.020,0:07:38.720
We believe it is all cause for joy, because the end is sweet.

0:07:38.720,0:07:45.960
We know all your suffering, pain and agony have come to an end.

0:07:45.960,0:07:46.820
I'm sorry.

0:07:46.820,0:07:52.280
People of God, I wasn't safe.

0:07:52.280,0:08:03.600
I would be at home and suddenly, my aunt would come back home with a guest.

0:08:03.600,0:08:08.220
And that ‘guest’ was a terrible experience for me.

0:08:08.220,0:08:13.680
I would be sent to ‘serve’ that person, whether I wanted it or not.

0:08:13.680,0:08:19.600
Now, think about it – men that you don’t know that it’s going to happen but it will happen.

0:08:19.600,0:08:24.380
It indeed happened – four to five times; it was terrible.

0:08:24.380,0:08:32.180
That is why I said that all my life I had been raped, rejected and felt like nothing.

0:08:32.180,0:08:38.620
These are the things that have been in my mind that I’m ugly and completely nothing.

0:08:38.620,0:08:49.140
Among those men who came to me, there was a man who God helped me through.

0:08:49.140,0:08:57.200
He saw the pain in me and said, “I don’t understand; what is this?

0:08:57.200,0:09:04.080
You are crying and in pieces, what is wrong?

0:09:04.080,0:09:09.880
I know you don’t want to do this; I can’t do this. I don’t have the heart; I cannot do it.

0:09:09.880,0:09:20.060
Don’t be scared of me, I’m going to help you. You are in pain; I can see it and feel it.

0:09:20.060,0:09:23.060
Don’t be scared; I won’t hurt you.”

0:09:23.060,0:09:27.940
That was how he talked to me and said that he would help me.

0:09:27.940,0:09:41.740
The man called my uncle and told him, “If this girl gets killed or falls into problems, as her father,

0:09:41.740,0:09:47.720
you will be responsible for it. Come here and let me tell you what is going on.”

0:09:47.720,0:09:50.320
So, they met and after the meeting,

0:09:50.320,0:09:55.040
the man said he was going to pay for an apartment for me, for two years.

0:09:55.040,0:10:02.960
Indeed, he found an apartment for me, I moved in and he paid for the apartment.

0:10:02.960,0:10:11.420
He did it like as a father would; he helped in different ways.

0:10:11.420,0:10:16.340
He said it was too painful the day he saw me; he wanted to see me happy and

0:10:16.340,0:10:22.880
he was ready to stand and protect me if anything happened to me, which he did.

0:10:22.880,0:10:29.300
I started going to school from my apartment, I found a job and was working part-time.

0:10:29.300,0:10:38.600
I took a hair dressing course.

0:10:38.600,0:10:45.960
About six to seven months later, I was working together with my neighbour’s wife;

0:10:45.960,0:10:49.480
we became friends, the woman was Danish.

0:10:49.480,0:10:59.160
My husband had grown up together with her husband but he lived far away in a village.

0:10:59.160,0:11:07.560
He came to visit my neighbours and I was there grilling together with the lady I worked with.

0:11:07.560,0:11:12.080
So, we met but we didn’t exchange contact details at once.

0:11:12.080,0:11:17.780
For about a year, we would talk now and again as he lived far away.

0:11:17.780,0:11:25.940
After that year, things became serious and he told me that he wanted to marry me.

0:11:25.940,0:11:30.260
I didn’t trust him but he said I should trust him

0:11:30.260,0:11:34.860
and that meeting me was the best thing that happened to him.

0:11:34.860,0:11:37.580
He said I was ‘over kind’.

0:11:37.580,0:11:45.800
I said, “OK but I don’t know if your family will accept me because I am dark skinned”.

0:11:45.800,0:11:54.060
He said, “If they love me, they will love you and if they don’t love me, they will reject you.

0:11:54.060,0:11:58.640
And if they reject you, they reject me too.”

0:11:58.640,0:12:06.420
OK, you mean it was in the house of that Danish friend where you met with your current husband.

0:12:06.420,0:12:08.020
Yes.

0:12:08.020,0:12:09.400
OK

0:12:09.400,0:12:12.100
Before you go any further from there, could you just tell us...

0:12:12.100,0:12:19.020
You made us to understand that right from the age of 4, you were abused to the age of 15 by unknown men.

0:12:19.020,0:12:22.440
Could you tell us what was the consequence of this abuse?

0:12:22.440,0:12:26.980
The abuse happened in different ways.

0:12:26.980,0:12:33.900
Back home, from 13 years old, I had a baby boy.

0:12:33.900,0:12:38.140
Before I was 14 years old, I had another one.

0:12:38.140,0:12:43.760
By the age of 15-16 years old, I had three children.

0:12:43.760,0:12:49.800
I was 16 and these children till now, are back home.

0:12:49.800,0:12:52.040
Then, you were not married.

0:12:52.040,0:12:55.260
I was not married.

0:12:55.260,0:13:02.300
I moved in with my husband and we have been together now for 16 years.

0:13:02.300,0:13:04.460
We have a girl together.

0:13:04.460,0:13:07.580
Could you tell us; in the course of these terrible experiences -

0:13:07.580,0:13:09.900
was there anything you were addicted to?

0:13:09.900,0:13:15.120
When I was 10 years old, I started to smoke and I became addicted to smoking.

0:13:15.120,0:13:23.760
I could smoke more than 40 cigarettes a day.

0:13:23.760,0:13:30.440
Finally, with me being sick here and there, at times, I would want to run away from home.

0:13:30.440,0:13:37.600
Whenever I saw lots of snow, I wanted to run and bury my head inside it.

0:13:37.600,0:13:39.800
I would go crazy in the house.

0:13:39.800,0:13:44.960
My husband did everything he could and I would tell him every day

0:13:44.960,0:13:48.880
that it was not material things that I wanted but rather my freedom.

0:13:48.880,0:13:52.020
I told him that I was not free, that I was in pain.

0:13:52.020,0:14:05.620
Then one day, while on YouTube, I suddenly came across Emmanuel TV

0:14:05.620,0:14:09.580
where I was surprised to see a lot of people being delivered.

0:14:09.580,0:14:11.440
I said, "My God".

0:14:11.440,0:14:17.740
I saw people in situations like mine and worse

0:14:17.740,0:14:25.580
and said to myself that this man would be the one to take me out of my pain,

0:14:25.580,0:14:28.340
that I had to look for him.

0:14:28.340,0:14:31.500
Mrs Lucy Atim Hansen
Deliverance Testimony

0:14:31.500,0:14:42.820
From that day, I started to watch Emmanuel TV every single day.

0:14:42.820,0:14:46.860
I could sit and watch it for the whole day.

0:14:46.860,0:14:48.640
My husband would travel a lot.

0:14:48.640,0:14:53.860
When he was not at home, I would not go to the bedroom; I would sleep in the living room.

0:14:53.860,0:15:01.080
We don’t have Emmanuel TV but I would watch it through YouTube.

0:15:01.080,0:15:05.800
I would sit and watch it the whole night and day.

0:15:05.800,0:15:10.520
My husband and children would tell me, “You with this TV – you are going crazy”.

0:15:10.520,0:15:11.700
Even the kids...

0:15:11.700,0:15:19.520
I would tell them that this man was the man who was going to make me happy.

0:15:19.520,0:15:23.560
I told them that I wanted to come here; that was eight months ago.

0:15:23.560,0:15:29.080
By the time I wanted to come here, things started to get worse.

0:15:29.080,0:15:36.300
Firstly, my husband told me that I had to make a choice – to have a holiday house in Africa

0:15:36.300,0:15:40.240
or go to The SCOAN.

0:15:40.240,0:15:46.440
I told him that if he wanted to see me happy, I wanted to go to The SCOAN.

0:15:46.440,0:15:53.980
I said if the house was meant for me in Africa, I would have it in the name of Jesus

0:15:53.980,0:15:59.020
but that first, I had to look for my freedom.

0:15:59.020,0:16:03.180
He responded that he wanted to see me happy.

0:16:03.180,0:16:09.340
Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:16:09.340,0:16:14.900
Your husband said, "I promised to build you a mansion back in Uganda.

0:16:14.900,0:16:23.620
Now, make a choice between these two: acquiring this mansion and going to The SCOAN here in Nigeria."

0:16:23.620,0:16:26.600
The woman made the best, wisest choice.

0:16:26.600,0:16:33.760
She told the husband, "Look, I prefer to go to The SCOAN and get my freedom.

0:16:33.760,0:16:37.880
The house is a secondary issue. The primary thing is my freedom."

0:16:37.880,0:16:43.880
The husband said, "Well, let it be according to your wish. I will prepare your passport and visa."

0:16:43.880,0:16:49.320
Not long after that, the DHL brought her passport and visa, right to her house.

0:16:49.320,0:16:54.900
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:16:54.900,0:17:00.280
Finally, when your visa and passport came to your door post, what happened?

0:17:00.280,0:17:08.300
Three days later, he told me that I had to pack, that I said I was going on Friday,

0:17:08.300,0:17:12.520
so, by Saturday, I would be in Nigeria.

0:17:12.520,0:17:16.520
On Saturday, on my way to the airport, I was smoking.

0:17:16.520,0:17:20.380
When I came out of the airport, it was like I was on fire

0:17:20.380,0:17:24.560
because I had been on the flight for so long.

0:17:24.560,0:17:27.740
I took my things out of the airport and on standing there,

0:17:27.740,0:17:30.060
the driver asked me if he could put my luggage in his car.

0:17:30.060,0:17:39.620
I said no, that I had to fulfil this: I smoked three cigarettes at the same time.

0:17:39.620,0:17:50.980
When I arrived at the hotel, I smoked another cigarette before being taken to my room.

0:17:50.980,0:18:00.600
I came downstairs and by the pool, I smoked another two sticks before paying the driver off.

0:18:00.600,0:18:04.340
The taxi driver asked, “Madam, are you not smoking too much?”

0:18:04.340,0:18:11.780
I responded, “What is too much? This is not too much; I haven’t smoked for many hours”.

0:18:11.780,0:18:12.860
Then, he left.

0:18:12.860,0:18:18.120
For the whole night, I couldn’t sleep because I wanted to come here.

0:18:18.120,0:18:22.860
That was the time that I smoked even more than usual.

0:18:22.860,0:18:25.140
For the whole Saturday night, I was smoking.

0:18:25.140,0:18:27.840
I didn't sleep, I was awake.

0:18:27.840,0:18:32.380
At 3am, I prepared myself; I told the taxi to come at four.

0:18:32.380,0:18:34.120
At 4am, he was there.

0:18:34.120,0:18:39.500
I was outside with a cup of coffee and a smoke.

0:18:39.500,0:18:43.200
I had already smoked ten by that time.

0:18:43.200,0:18:46.580
When there is something that you want so badly,

0:18:46.580,0:18:49.600
there will also be many things that will want to stop you.

0:18:49.600,0:18:56.920
It was hard to come in but when I came in, I sat over there.

0:18:56.920,0:19:00.380
I was praying and suddenly the man of God came in.

0:19:00.380,0:19:05.180
When he came in, he was talking to people and I began to sleep.

0:19:05.180,0:19:09.020
I did not hear a word he was saying because I was sleeping.

0:19:09.020,0:19:12.960
I went outside and poured water on myself but I was still sleepy.

0:19:12.960,0:19:15.020
I asked myself, “What is this?”

0:19:15.020,0:19:21.080
The time I woke up, he was on the gallery, delivering people.

0:19:21.080,0:19:22.840
I started panicking.

0:19:22.840,0:19:26.300
I was looking forward to this but I was panicking.

0:19:26.300,0:19:34.680
I was telling a man that I needed to go outside and get some fresh air.

0:19:34.680,0:19:37.260
He told me that the man of God was already here.

0:19:37.260,0:19:40.080
I said no, that I would make it.

0:19:40.080,0:19:44.020
It was not because I wanted fresh air but I was panicking and wanted to smoke.

0:19:44.020,0:19:46.600
I wanted to smoke because I was scared.

0:19:46.600,0:19:53.080
The moment I was talking with him, I heard people around me making noises.

0:19:53.080,0:19:58.860
I closed my eyes and held myself like this.

0:19:58.860,0:20:05.840
Then suddenly I felt something like a hammer hit my head, people of God.

0:20:05.840,0:20:11.600
Mrs Lucy Atim Hansen
Deliverance Testimony

0:20:11.600,0:20:15.680
It was not a touch, it was a hammer.

0:20:15.680,0:20:20.240
Then I was like, “Who hit me like that?”

0:20:20.240,0:20:26.340
I touched my head because I thought my head was smashed.

0:20:26.340,0:20:29.760
I screamed, that was the only thing I knew.

0:20:29.760,0:20:38.480
The next thing I knew I was somewhere here on those stairs.

0:20:38.480,0:20:42.740
They were telling me, “It’s OK, sister, calm down”.

0:20:42.740,0:20:54.700
I was in awe but also so mad that I felt I could tear them into pieces.

0:20:54.700,0:20:59.200
As the day went, my anger subsided.

0:20:59.200,0:21:02.820
Viewers all over the world, watch the screen of your TV;

0:21:02.820,0:21:08.580
that was exactly what the sister is narrating as part of her experience.

0:21:08.580,0:21:10.880
She came and sat down in the church.

0:21:10.880,0:21:15.480
When the man of God was about to give messages of prophecy and was moving forward,

0:21:15.480,0:21:19.520
close to where she was, she started to feel terrible heat inside of her,

0:21:19.520,0:21:23.320
to the extent that she was telling the person next to her that she wanted to leave the church premises.

0:21:23.320,0:21:27.400
The person sitting next to her said, "You don't need to go out. The man of God is coming closer".

0:21:27.400,0:21:30.060
She said she needed to find fresh air.

0:21:30.060,0:21:34.960
That was exactly, without being told, when the evil spirit was actually troubling her,

0:21:34.960,0:21:38.580
because darkness and light have no meeting point.

0:21:38.580,0:21:43.840
Exactly in the moment the man of God came close to her, she felt uncomfortable.

0:21:43.840,0:21:47.860
When the man of God laid his hand on her, the evil spirit started manifesting

0:21:47.860,0:21:50.200
as you can see on the screen of your TV.

0:21:50.200,0:21:57.860
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:21:57.860,0:22:06.300
After that touch, I got my deliverance but I was still mad.

0:22:06.300,0:22:15.120
Later in the evening, I was prayed for again and felt the same bang on my head.

0:22:15.120,0:22:22.220
I said, “God, do I have to be beaten many times like this today?”

0:22:22.220,0:22:28.240
It was late in the evening when the programme finished.

0:22:28.240,0:22:34.900
The workers told the man of God that my hotel was very far, close to the airport.

0:22:34.900,0:22:41.780
He instructed them that I should not go to my hotel but that I should stay in the church

0:22:41.780,0:22:44.340
because at that late time, it was risky.

0:22:44.340,0:22:49.760
They prepared a nice place for me with a nice bed.

0:22:49.760,0:22:51.740
Normally, I did not just fall asleep

0:22:51.740,0:23:00.420
but I was so tired that I just fell on my bed with the same clothes and slept.

0:23:00.420,0:23:04.320
Suddenly, something just lifted me up.

0:23:04.320,0:23:09.500
People of God, I was in the air like this, hanging.

0:23:09.500,0:23:12.960
I said, "Wow, what is that?"

0:23:12.960,0:23:17.380
I was so heavy, on the roof of the house

0:23:17.380,0:23:22.860
and when I suddenly woke up, I dropped onto the bed again.

0:23:22.860,0:23:29.820
I was scared and something came out of me!

0:23:29.820,0:23:32.780
I could feel it.

0:23:32.780,0:23:41.720
It was like I was two persons and someone pulled me up and left.

0:23:41.720,0:23:50.760
I turned around to look at where it was going and I was in awe and went back to sleep again.

0:23:50.760,0:23:57.100
A few minutes later, it happened again up to three times and I went back to sleep again.

0:23:57.100,0:24:00.480
The following day on a Monday, I went back to the hotel.

0:24:00.480,0:24:05.420
When I reached the hotel, I said, “Now that I am not in the church, I can take a smoke”.

0:24:05.420,0:24:08.320
When I tried to smoke, it was not tasting the same.

0:24:08.320,0:24:10.620
I said, "Ah".

0:24:10.620,0:24:16.980
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:24:16.980,0:24:19.440
It is indeed a wonderful experience.

0:24:19.440,0:24:22.760
I thought that it may have been because I had not been smoking.

0:24:22.760,0:24:33.300
I was in the church the whole day and night and I did not smoke.

0:24:33.300,0:24:41.160
I went up, got a coffee, went to the pool and tried to light a cigarette but it was not working.

0:24:41.160,0:24:46.940
The driver was asking me why I was throwing away the whole cigarette.

0:24:46.940,0:24:51.800
I told him that it did not taste the same and that maybe I was delivered from smoking as well.

0:24:51.800,0:24:54.580
He replied that he thought so too.

0:24:54.580,0:25:02.960
Then I said that if I was delivered from smoking and I try to force myself to smoke,

0:25:02.960,0:25:10.260
then it is like I am testing, or trying God that if He was real, He should take it away from me.

0:25:10.260,0:25:14.100
He has already taken it away from me, then I will not try it again.

0:25:14.100,0:25:19.060
I had 12 sealed packets of cigarettes.

0:25:19.060,0:25:22.460
Each packet had 30 cigarettes.

0:25:22.460,0:25:31.020
I took all of them and four lighters to where there was a big ash tray outside the hotel,

0:25:31.020,0:25:34.900
left them there, got into a taxi and came here.

0:25:34.900,0:25:40.280
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:25:40.280,0:25:41.900
To God be the glory.

0:25:41.900,0:25:46.700
At the end of the day, you are letting us know that right now, as you are talking,

0:25:46.700,0:25:48.720
you have stopped smoking.

0:25:48.720,0:25:52.960
I haven’t smoked since Sunday.

0:25:52.960,0:25:57.500
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:25:57.500,0:25:59.740
God lives in this house.

0:25:59.740,0:26:02.440
He is alive.

0:26:02.440,0:26:07.260
I tried to attain deliverance in many kinds of churches

0:26:07.260,0:26:09.920
but I have never received this kind of touch.

0:26:09.920,0:26:17.260
Usually after finishing a church service, I would go outside and smoke or go to the hospital

0:26:17.260,0:26:26.980
but since I came here, I now eat and go to the toilet normally which was not the case before.

0:26:26.980,0:26:30.460
I do everything normally. I don’t have the urge to smoke.

0:26:30.460,0:26:34.760
This is someone who would smoke every five minutes. I don’t have the feeling to smoke.

0:26:34.760,0:26:37.900
When I pass people outside there who are smoking,

0:26:37.900,0:26:40.160
I don’t have the feeling to do the same.

0:26:40.160,0:26:43.320
What about the migraine and depression?

0:26:43.320,0:26:46.500
I don’t have depression and I feel happy.

0:26:46.500,0:26:51.680
Secondly, the man of God has been treating me like his baby.

0:26:51.680,0:26:57.160
This is the kind of treatment that I have never had.

0:26:57.160,0:27:00.020
He gave me a place to stay.

0:27:00.020,0:27:04.300
Could you just explain to us the pictures we can see on the notice board.

0:27:04.300,0:27:08.380
As you can see here, this is my husband.

0:27:08.380,0:27:11.080
This is my first son.

0:27:11.080,0:27:13.240
This is the second.

0:27:13.240,0:27:14.740
This is the third.

0:27:14.740,0:27:16.880
This is the fourth.

0:27:16.880,0:27:19.780
This is the last.

0:27:19.780,0:27:24.880
As you can see on this board - this is a letter from my doctor,

0:27:24.880,0:27:40.800
stating that I was undergoing treatment for migraine and psychiatric treatment.

0:27:40.800,0:27:50.320
Every third month, I had to get 40 to 50 injections inside my nerves

0:27:50.320,0:27:56.120
and at the back of my head to relax my muscles.

0:27:56.120,0:27:58.860
This is what you see here.

0:27:58.860,0:28:03.560
But after you were delivered, old things passed away, all things have become new.

0:28:03.560,0:28:04.340
Yes.

0:28:04.340,0:28:09.780
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:28:09.780,0:28:16.080
I had a lot of medications that I took every day, like six to seven

0:28:16.080,0:28:19.180
but I have not been feeling any pain.

0:28:19.180,0:28:26.360
I had two operations on my right shoulder and was preparing to go for a third one

0:28:26.360,0:28:30.840
but I do not feel any pain; I can sleep without pain.

0:28:30.840,0:28:33.880
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:28:33.880,0:28:35.420
To God be the glory.

0:28:35.420,0:28:41.460
Finally, we thank the Lord Almighty for setting you free from this trouble,

0:28:41.460,0:28:46.700
taking you out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light.

0:28:46.700,0:28:59.640
Viewers around the world and in the church, the only advice I can give you is one thing:

0:28:59.640,0:29:16.420
If you see a child looking for your shoulder to rest her or his head on, please take that child as yours.

0:29:16.420,0:29:20.920
Respect that child as you respect your own.

0:29:20.920,0:29:25.020
Give them love because you do not know tomorrow.

0:29:25.020,0:29:26.980
God will reward you.

0:29:26.980,0:29:30.360
Take care of the little ones.

0:29:30.360,0:29:32.420
Don’t let them suffer.

0:29:32.420,0:29:36.520
Thank you, let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:29:36.520,0:29:43.660
We strongly believe that that piece of advice is coming from your past experience in life.

0:29:43.660,0:29:51.360
We believe you are rejuvenated, old things passed away, all things have become new.

0:29:51.360,0:29:54.900
We thank God Almighty for what the Lord Jesus has done in your life.

0:29:54.900,0:30:01.680
We pray that your deliverance, healing and breakthrough will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:30:01.680,0:30:02.420
Amen.

0:30:02.420,0:30:05.740
Go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,

0:30:05.740,0:30:11.440
and as you go and do so, always have it at the back of your mind, that better is not good enough,

0:30:11.440,0:30:13.520
the best is always yet to come.

0:30:13.520,0:30:16.780
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
