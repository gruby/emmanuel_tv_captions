Israel's Minister Of Tourism Yariv Levin Meets With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:13.520,0:00:19.560
Welcome to Israel, welcome to Jerusalem - although I know it is almost a second home for you.

0:00:19.560,0:00:20.840
Thank you.

0:00:20.840,0:00:23.680
And of course, welcome to the Ministry of Tourism.

0:00:23.680,0:00:25.780
Thank you.

0:00:25.780,0:00:36.820
I must say I have read about your activities and first of all, I want to say, thank you.

0:00:36.820,0:00:38.940
I appreciate it very much -

0:00:38.940,0:00:46.920
seeing you as a prominent leader, saying things loud and clear and doing that on the ground.

0:00:46.920,0:00:58.300
Those who follow the truth in hard times, I believe that in the end, are remembered as real leaders.

0:00:58.300,0:01:09.000
We saw it in the past, in history and that's what will happen also regarding the times we live in.

0:01:09.000,0:01:18.800
I personally believe that for us in Israel, because we live here in the Holy Land,

0:01:18.800,0:01:26.780
making it possible for every believer, whether Jew, Christian or Muslim, to come here

0:01:26.780,0:01:36.940
to visit the holy places, to pray and do everything they want to do and feel safe while doing it,

0:01:36.940,0:01:43.840
is something that is not just an obligation but even a big right that we have

0:01:43.840,0:01:47.020
to make sure that all of that happens.

0:01:47.020,0:01:54.420
I do believe that making the possibility for people to come here and see things with their own eyes

0:01:54.420,0:02:05.100
and feel it, is much more than the ability to visit a place but rather an experience for life.

0:02:05.100,0:02:18.360
I believe that everyone who comes here goes back to their family and people as a different and better person.

0:02:18.360,0:02:28.520
In that aspect, I think that if we succeed in making it easier for more people to come here,

0:02:28.520,0:02:33.440
it’s not only a question of tourism but I believe it’s also a question of really giving people

0:02:33.440,0:02:42.020
something that is an added value for life and something that will fulfill our obligation.

0:02:42.020,0:02:51.920
Also, we are lucky to be in a place where we are able to do that.

0:02:51.920,0:03:00.980
In that aspect, I do believe in the potential of what we can do regarding tourism from Africa

0:03:00.980,0:03:03.960
as a whole and especially from Nigeria.

0:03:03.960,0:03:08.460
I believe that we are very far from exploiting the potential.

0:03:08.460,0:03:14.420
I believe we can do much more in order to do that.

0:03:14.420,0:03:22.120
We now have a much better cooperation with the Ministry of Interior regarding visas.

0:03:22.120,0:03:28.780
I'm really willing and at your disposal in order to hear what you expect from us.

0:03:28.780,0:03:30.680
Thank you.

0:03:30.680,0:03:35.520
Minister, I want to thank you for this great honour, for taking your time.

0:03:35.520,0:03:37.200
So, thank you very much.

0:03:37.200,0:03:43.040
I have been coming to Israel for many years; this is my home.

0:03:43.040,0:03:53.620
We have several travel agencies in Israel that are specialised in pilgrimage packages

0:03:53.620,0:04:00.400
that enable people to really visit the most important places and do it in a meaningful way.

0:04:00.400,0:04:06.520
I want to thank you, Minister, for your time and for your love.

0:04:06.520,0:04:10.040
We are at your disposal and we are really willing to help.

0:04:10.040,0:04:10.540
Thank you.

0:04:10.540,0:04:14.640
We see it as a really important initiative.

0:04:14.640,0:04:23.140
Please, don't hesitate to contact us to ask if there is anything you think that we can help with.

0:04:23.140,0:04:23.740
Thank you.

0:04:23.740,0:04:25.000
Just tell us.

0:04:25.000,0:04:26.020
Thank you very much.

0:04:26.020,0:04:31.360
Israel's Minister Of Tourism Yariv Levin Meets With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:04:31.360,0:04:36.680
I'm Yariv Levin, Minister of Tourism for the state of Israel.

0:04:36.680,0:04:42.760
I just had a very important meeting with Prophet Joshua.

0:04:42.760,0:04:45.440
It was an honour for me to meet him.

0:04:45.440,0:04:49.200
So, the Holy Land is waiting for you. 
Israel is waiting for you.

0:04:49.200,0:04:51.820
Please come here.
You are most welcome.

0:04:51.820,0:04:56.660
I'm Yariv Levin, Minister of Tourism for the state of Israel.

0:04:56.660,0:05:03.020
I call on you: Please, continue watching Emmanuel TV!
It's worth it.

0:05:03.020,0:05:14.860
Prophet T.B. Joshua Meets With The Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau In Jerusalem

0:05:14.860,0:05:15.620
It's a pleasure.

0:05:15.620,0:05:16.580
Thank you.

0:05:16.580,0:05:22.700
Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau Hosts Prophet T.B. Joshua In Jerusalem

0:05:22.700,0:05:27.140
This is your home so we are brothers.

0:05:27.140,0:05:29.980
This is my home; I'm happy to meet you.

0:05:29.980,0:05:33.780
But I have the privilege that I was born here.

0:05:33.780,0:05:39.660
Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau Hosts Prophet T.B. Joshua In Jerusalem

0:05:39.660,0:05:44.380
I'm happy that you are giving us your time.

0:05:44.380,0:05:47.460
You feel that this is your home.

0:05:47.460,0:06:05.660
You know, in the Bible you can find this sentence.

0:06:05.660,0:06:12.880
This is a person and person who was born in this place.

0:06:12.880,0:06:21.160
Our sages explain why the Bible says a person and person.

0:06:21.160,0:06:23.980
Why twice?

0:06:23.980,0:06:36.960
The explanation is, first a person who was born here and the second is to be spiritually born here.

0:06:36.960,0:06:47.420
Someone whose dream to feel at home here is exactly the same as someone who was born here.

0:06:47.420,0:06:54.860
What the Bible is trying to say there is someone who is born physically and spiritually.

0:06:54.860,0:06:58.500
There is also one who is born spiritually.

0:06:58.500,0:07:03.320
I am one of the children born spiritually but I was not born physically.

0:07:03.320,0:07:06.440
You were born physically and spiritually.

0:07:06.440,0:07:18.420
Because of that, I need your words because I know a lot of people who were born here but only physically.

0:07:18.420,0:07:22.140
They forgot about being born spiritually.

0:07:22.140,0:07:33.220
Because of that, your warm words help me to explain to people how important it is to be born here spiritually.

0:07:33.220,0:07:33.780
Thank you.

0:07:33.780,0:07:36.100
This is a very, very nice place.

0:07:36.100,0:07:42.320
It is my privilege to see you here and hear your words.

0:07:42.320,0:07:46.000
I want to tell you one more sentence.

0:07:46.000,0:07:56.420
This is a place where you can find all kinds of people.

0:07:56.420,0:08:07.280
I was in South Africa last year and they asked me about the differences between people -

0:08:07.280,0:08:20.260
if someone is a Muslim, Christian, Jew, black or white.

0:08:20.260,0:08:31.040
I told them they could see, in every hospital in Israel, in every department in Israel, you can see

0:08:31.040,0:08:35.320
among the people who treat and the people who need treatment,

0:08:35.320,0:08:43.440
you can see beds near each other and they help each other.

0:08:43.440,0:08:53.400
It doesn’t depend on whether you are a Jew or Muslim, Jew or Gentile.

0:08:53.400,0:08:55.000
Exactly.

0:08:55.000,0:08:55.940
Thank you.

0:08:55.940,0:08:58.720
What is unique about the hospitals in Israel

0:08:58.720,0:09:02.580
is that we take care of everybody and everybody takes care of everybody.

0:09:02.580,0:09:06.420
You can have nurses and doctors that are Arabs or Christians or Jews

0:09:06.420,0:09:09.380
and you can have people who are ill that are also Arabs, Christians or Jews.

0:09:09.380,0:09:11.500
That is the meaning of Holy Land.

0:09:11.500,0:09:13.980
Yes, this is the Holy Land.

0:09:13.980,0:09:16.560
The Holy Land accepts everyone.

0:09:16.560,0:09:20.200
Everyone wants to be holy.

0:09:20.200,0:09:31.040
In the Bible, you can find another sentence that says, all of us are children of God.

0:09:31.040,0:09:39.280
Because of that, I and you, he and she – all of us are children of one Father.

0:09:39.280,0:09:43.980
So, this is why I told you we are brothers.

0:09:43.980,0:09:46.320
Now, you can see it in the Bible.

0:09:46.320,0:09:47.660
Thank you.

0:09:47.660,0:10:07.460
Twenty-eight years ago, someone from Israel went to Nigeria to build telecommunications.

0:10:07.460,0:10:21.260
His flight was involved in an accident and all 143 people died.

0:10:21.260,0:10:27.680
The plane crashed.

0:10:27.680,0:10:34.060
His wife was in the city I was in as Chief Rabbi.

0:10:34.060,0:10:37.680
She called me and asked me what to do.

0:10:37.680,0:10:44.440
She didn’t know exactly if her husband had died or not.

0:10:44.440,0:10:50.620
She didn’t know whether she should mourn yet or not.

0:10:50.620,0:10:55.540
The details – she didn’t know.

0:10:55.540,0:11:02.200
I sent someone from Israel to your country.

0:11:02.200,0:11:09.360
He went there and found a taxi driver.

0:11:09.360,0:11:13.400
I have remembered the name for 28 years.

0:11:13.400,0:11:19.420
We spoke; he was the taxi driver that took him to the airport.

0:11:19.420,0:11:28.680
We spoke about it; I took all the details and told her I was sure that he had died.

0:11:28.680,0:11:33.760
Because of that, she could get married to another man.

0:11:33.760,0:11:44.020
It was something amazing; 28 years ago, communication was not as easy as today.

0:11:44.020,0:11:47.400
That is Nigeria, they love foreigners.

0:11:47.400,0:11:52.800
When they see that you are not a Nigerian but from another country, they are ready to die for you.

0:11:52.800,0:11:59.820
I felt it; it was such a warm help.

0:11:59.820,0:12:02.580
I am very thankful for it.

0:12:02.580,0:12:14.360
Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau Hosts Prophet T.B. Joshua In Jerusalem

0:12:14.360,0:12:20.660
For me as a Chief Rabbi of Israel, it is a very great pleasure to meet you,

0:12:20.660,0:12:26.880
to see a lot of things you have done, giving all of your life and your power

0:12:26.880,0:12:32.400
and thinking about other people in the world - it is very nice to see it.
