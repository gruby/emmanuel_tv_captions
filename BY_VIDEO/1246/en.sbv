0:00:00.000,0:00:03.960
Thank You, Jesus, for my joy.

0:00:03.960,0:00:09.360
This is joy - joy everlasting.

0:00:09.360,0:00:13.760
This shows today is the day of joy for your life.

0:00:13.760,0:00:18.120
Today is the day of joy for my life.

0:00:18.120,0:00:25.480
Today my enemy has made a big mistake.

0:00:25.480,0:00:30.720
Today is the day of my salvation,

0:00:30.720,0:00:37.780
the day of my breakthrough because Jesus is alive.

0:00:37.780,0:00:39.620
Thank You, Jesus!

0:00:39.620,0:00:41.620
Give thanks to Him.

0:00:46.460,0:00:50.740
Welcome to the arena of liberty.

0:00:50.740,0:00:56.500
Welcome to the presence of the living Jesus.

0:00:56.500,0:01:02.080
No matter what you have been facing up to now,

0:01:02.080,0:01:06.780
no matter the trouble you have been having so far,

0:01:06.780,0:01:11.460
today you will know that Jesus is aware.

0:01:11.460,0:01:18.780
Say, "Neighbour, Jesus is aware of my situation".

0:01:18.780,0:01:25.020
Whatever has been happening to me so far, He is in control.

0:01:25.020,0:01:27.660
It is for my advancement.

0:01:27.660,0:01:30.440
It is for my breakthrough.

0:01:30.440,0:01:32.520
Give thanks to Jesus for that.

0:01:32.520,0:01:37.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:37.880,0:01:40.360
Hallelujah.

0:01:40.360,0:01:42.360
Have your seat in His presence.

0:01:42.360,0:01:45.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:45.020,0:01:52.660
We are serving a faithful and true God.

0:01:52.660,0:01:57.840
Whatever people must have said about you,

0:01:57.840,0:02:02.460
whatever your situation must have told you,

0:02:02.460,0:02:07.980
today you will know the truth about yourself.

0:02:07.980,0:02:12.460
I am here, ready for the battle.

0:02:12.460,0:02:15.740
I am ready for the battle.

0:02:15.740,0:02:20.160
I am ready for victory.

0:02:20.160,0:02:28.440
Brethren, the reason why so many people in the Church today are weak

0:02:28.440,0:02:36.020
is because they are not armed for battle.

0:02:36.020,0:02:45.660
The first step to be strong is to realise that life is a battleground.

0:02:45.660,0:02:50.120
That is why you have been experiencing all these things because life is a battleground.

0:02:50.120,0:02:52.600
There is no neutral ground.

0:02:52.600,0:02:55.940
Say, "Neighbour, there is no neutral ground".

0:02:55.940,0:03:00.440
There is no hideout.

0:03:00.440,0:03:09.480
The purpose of God in your life cannot be fulfilled without the heat of trials.

0:03:09.480,0:03:17.680
It can be sickness, affliction, joblessness - just name it.

0:03:17.680,0:03:24.120
The purpose of God in your life can never be fulfilled without a battle.

0:03:24.120,0:03:26.020
Prepare yourself for battle.

0:03:26.020,0:03:30.280
Say, "Neighbour, prepare yourself for battle -

0:03:30.280,0:03:34.740
for your business, home and destiny.

0:03:34.740,0:03:40.660
Prepare yourself for battle".

0:03:40.660,0:03:43.360
Life is not perfect.

0:03:43.360,0:03:49.760
We are living in a world where the enemy will never allow

0:03:49.760,0:03:56.180
God's purpose in our lives to be fulfilled without putting up a battle.

0:03:56.180,0:03:59.700
You need to put up a battle.

0:03:59.700,0:04:04.040
That is why you are here and the battle is the Lord's.

0:04:04.040,0:04:45.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:45.940,0:04:49.120
Be ready for the battle.

0:04:49.120,0:04:51.620
Be ready for victory.

0:04:51.620,0:04:56.140
This brings us to the title of our message today: THE BELIEVER'S CONFLICT.

0:04:56.140,0:05:01.860
Tell your neighbour, "The Believer's Conflict".

0:05:01.860,0:05:16.080
Let me take you to the Book of Joshua 24; I start my reading from verse 14.

0:05:16.080,0:05:21.940
"Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth,

0:05:21.940,0:05:27.640
and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.

0:05:27.640,0:05:29.080
Serve the Lord."

0:05:29.080,0:05:30.860
Verse 15.

0:05:30.860,0:05:33.680
"And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,

0:05:33.680,0:05:37.980
choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve,

0:05:37.980,0:05:43.200
whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River,

0:05:43.200,0:05:47.340
or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.

0:05:47.340,0:05:52.560
But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."

0:05:52.560,0:05:53.660
Verse 18.

0:05:53.660,0:05:57.040
"And the Lord drove out from before us all the people,

0:05:57.040,0:06:00.080
including the Amorites who dwelt in the land.

0:06:00.080,0:06:04.480
We also will serve the Lord, for He is our God."

0:06:04.480,0:06:06.300
Last verse.

0:06:06.300,0:06:12.140
"But Joshua said to the people, 'You cannot serve the Lord, for He is a holy God.

0:06:12.140,0:06:17.780
He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins'."

0:06:17.780,0:06:22.540
Let someone say, "The Believer's Conflict".

0:06:22.540,0:06:30.540
The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we cannot separate warfare from salvation

0:06:30.540,0:06:37.480
because true salvation puts us into direct conflict with satan.

0:06:37.480,0:06:45.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:45.000,0:06:49.220
The moment we make a true conversion to Jesus,

0:06:49.220,0:06:55.360
satan hates us the same way he hates Jesus.

0:06:55.360,0:07:03.840
When we are truly saved, we are engaged in a phenomenal battle.

0:07:03.840,0:07:07.560
The moment you took a heart decision to commit your life to Jesus,

0:07:07.560,0:07:14.880
total commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against the devil.

0:07:14.880,0:07:25.900
By identifying yourself to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, you have made satan your bitter enemy.

0:07:25.900,0:07:52.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:52.960,0:08:04.340
This world is not my home; I am just passing through.

0:08:04.340,0:08:13.880
Once Jesus Christ purchases us, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we become aliens, strangers

0:08:13.880,0:08:20.800
and there is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.

0:08:20.800,0:08:26.420
Once Jesus purchases us with His blood, we become aliens, strangers, foreigners

0:08:26.420,0:08:31.200
and there is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.

0:08:31.200,0:08:32.980
What do I mean?

0:08:32.980,0:08:37.460
You will not go where Jesus is not welcome.

0:08:37.460,0:08:41.480
You will not say what Jesus would not want you to say.

0:08:41.480,0:08:44.640
You will not do what Jesus would not want you to do.

0:08:44.640,0:08:48.660
You will only go where Jesus wants you to go.

0:08:48.660,0:08:51.800
The battle is the Lord’s.

0:08:51.800,0:08:55.080
Take your position.

0:08:55.080,0:08:59.880
Victory is certain.

0:08:59.880,0:09:05.440
We are spirit beings living in a physical body,

0:09:05.440,0:09:11.560
learning to live in a natural world dominated by satan.

0:09:11.560,0:09:18.000
He rules by sin, he fights in sin and sin is his weapon.

0:09:18.000,0:09:22.520
But glory be to God, in the name of Jesus, we have the victory!

0:09:22.520,0:09:29.680
But glory be to God, in the name of Jesus, I have the victory!

0:09:29.680,0:09:34.680
The best antidote to the poison of satan is to walk in the Spirit.

0:09:34.680,0:09:37.240
Walk in the Spirit.

0:09:37.240,0:09:39.380
Pray in the Spirit.

0:09:39.380,0:09:41.820
Move in the Spirit.

0:09:41.820,0:09:49.040
To walk in the Spirit, the key is not to suppress the flesh but to surrender to the Holy Spirit.

0:09:49.040,0:09:57.120
The instruction for such walk is entirely guided and regulated by the Spirit of Jesus.

0:09:57.120,0:10:00.920
How?

0:10:00.920,0:10:04.300
The Bible says we listen to the testimony of our conscience

0:10:04.300,0:10:09.200
because our heart is controlled by the Holy Spirit

0:10:09.200,0:10:16.260
In each step, each direction, each choice you make,

0:10:16.260,0:10:19.760
intimation and suggestion comes from the Holy Spirit -

0:10:19.760,0:10:26.100
the Commander, the Controller, the Instructor for such action be performed.

0:10:26.100,0:11:01.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:01.820,0:11:06.080
Say to your neighbour, "Prepare your heart.

0:11:06.080,0:11:08.400
Keep your heart".

0:11:08.400,0:11:13.700
That victory is there already for those who recognise it.

0:11:13.700,0:11:16.680
Let a smile light up your face.

0:11:16.680,0:11:20.860
That victory is already there.

0:11:20.860,0:11:28.440
That victory is already here for those who recognise it.

0:11:28.440,0:11:37.500
Our heart is a communication point, contact point, landing point for the Holy Spirit.

0:11:37.500,0:11:43.380
But today, because of many fleshly desires,

0:11:43.380,0:11:50.900
many hearts today have become a conflict room between flesh and spirit,

0:11:50.900,0:11:55.160
conflict between hate and love,

0:11:55.160,0:12:00.180
conflict between faith and doubt.

0:12:00.180,0:12:06.680
That is why the Bible says that our values need to be tested against facts and experiences.

0:12:06.680,0:12:13.160
A man may profess, “I’m a Christian”, but not such in heart.

0:12:13.160,0:12:20.940
A man may come out and say, “I’m a born again”, but not such in heart.

0:12:20.940,0:12:30.280
We know we are totally committed to Jesus Christ when that commitment is tested.

0:12:30.280,0:12:38.220
Jesus needs to test our commitment and the genuineness of our faith.

0:12:38.220,0:13:09.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:09.720,0:13:17.060
When we turn our Bible to the Book of Matthew 19:16-22,

0:13:17.060,0:13:21.380
we have a case of a rich, young ruler

0:13:21.380,0:13:28.760
who came to Jesus to express his zeal, his commitment to the Kingdom of God

0:13:28.760,0:13:38.860
and said to Jesus, “Lord, what can I do to inherit eternal life?”

0:13:38.860,0:13:47.840
Jesus answered by sending a declaration, a probing declaration to check the state of his heart

0:13:47.840,0:13:57.620
and said to the man, “Well done. But if you want to be perfect, there is something you need to do.

0:13:57.620,0:14:06.960
Go, take your possessions, sell them, give them to the poor, come and follow Me -

0:14:06.960,0:14:09.240
rewards for you in Heaven”.

0:14:09.240,0:14:11.940
There was a conflict in the heart of the man.

0:14:11.940,0:14:22.480
But the Bible says, he went back sorrowful because he had great possessions.

0:14:22.480,0:14:25.860
What can we say about that?

0:14:25.860,0:14:34.560
If our actions are motivated by self-interest, we are mortgaging tomorrow’s joy.

0:14:34.560,0:14:43.640
Doing something as a matter of commitment to God does not involve any condition attached.

0:14:43.640,0:14:53.440
If you make God one of those things, then your commitment to God will be partial, not total.

0:14:53.440,0:15:03.960
When your loyalty towards God enters into conflict with money, position, relationship, comfort,

0:15:03.960,0:15:08.400
you are likely to sit on the fence and become indifferent,

0:15:08.400,0:15:12.400
especifically when holding onto your faith is painful.

0:15:12.400,0:16:08.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:08.520,0:16:14.200
Such was the case of the people of Israel when they entered the promised land.

0:16:14.200,0:16:20.200
They said to Joshua, “We shall serve the Lord, our God”

0:16:20.200,0:16:25.440
and Joshua said to them, “You shall not be able to serve the Lord”.

0:16:25.440,0:16:29.300
Why did he say that? It wasn’t harsh.

0:16:29.300,0:16:36.260
The Bible says, he saw that there was a conflict in their heart between flesh and spirit.

0:16:36.260,0:16:46.220
There was a conflict as to know whether to give to God a total commitment or not.

0:16:46.220,0:16:53.000
As a leader in righteousness who conquered all the enemies,

0:16:53.000,0:17:02.100
Joshua knew that our responsibility to God is a commitment and fellowship rather than sacrifice.

0:17:02.100,0:17:08.500
Therefore, he urged them to give a total commitment to God - the only Source of salvation.

0:17:08.500,0:17:17.080
Say, "Neighbour, no matter what comes, no matter what happens, total commitment to Jesus -

0:17:17.080,0:17:23.980
the only Source of salvation - my Deliverer, my Protector - He is faithful.

0:17:23.980,0:17:28.740
Faith in Him is not a risk but a sure and practical act.

0:17:28.740,0:17:36.860
I want you to turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour, will you be ready to serve the Lord?

0:17:36.860,0:17:39.240
Are you ready?"

0:17:39.240,0:17:49.460
Today, many show great zeal out of mere conviction but lack fundamental roots in God.

0:17:49.460,0:17:52.120
Faith is our root in God.

0:17:52.120,0:17:58.260
It takes the grace of God Almighty to maintain your confession of faith

0:17:58.260,0:18:05.120
for when the heat, the vicissitudes, trials of this world come with their choking hands,

0:18:05.120,0:18:07.980
that unstable zeal is choked.

0:18:07.980,0:18:13.160
Glory be to God Almighty, as a believer, victory is yours today.

0:18:13.160,0:18:15.440
Victory is mine today.

0:18:15.440,0:18:37.120
The Holy Spirit uses my heart to guide my soul before I become what I confess.

0:18:37.120,0:18:39.520
I want you to stand up for a while.

0:18:39.520,0:18:43.060
You have to make a declaration. Are you ready for that?

0:18:43.060,0:18:50.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:50.040,0:18:53.340
You are not alone.

0:18:53.340,0:19:01.340
You are here today. Jesus knows the reason you are here today.

0:19:01.340,0:19:04.940
Jesus knows your past – nothing hidden.

0:19:04.940,0:19:08.340
He knows your present, the state of your mind.

0:19:08.340,0:19:12.620
He knows your future - nothing is hidden from Him.

0:19:12.620,0:19:18.820
A resolve to do whatever proper thing it takes separates the weak from the strong.

0:19:18.820,0:19:22.360
Joshua was a conqueror because his heart was for God.

0:19:22.360,0:19:24.080
He was determined.

0:19:24.080,0:19:26.880
Are you ready for the heart decision?

0:19:26.880,0:19:29.900
Are you ready to fight for your destiny?

0:19:29.900,0:19:32.720
Are you ready to fight for your career?

0:19:32.720,0:19:37.440
Are you ready to stand against that devil tormenting your life?

0:19:37.440,0:19:44.060
You have to know that he is a defeated foe; he knows it and you know it.

0:19:44.060,0:19:49.340
Say, “I will follow Jesus”.

0:19:49.340,0:19:53.540
Say, “I will serve Jesus”.

0:19:53.540,0:19:57.280
Say, “I will love Jesus”.

0:19:57.280,0:20:02.360
Say, “I and my family, we shall serve the Lord.

0:20:02.360,0:20:10.660
This is my declaration; this is my commitment – total, not partial.

0:20:10.660,0:20:14.060
Total – I will serve the Lord.

0:20:14.060,0:20:21.220
I stand on this commitment, no matter what happens, no matter what comes.

0:20:21.220,0:20:23.220
Thank You, Jesus!

0:20:23.220,0:20:31.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:56.480,0:21:01.020
Faith is not a hobby.

0:21:01.020,0:21:11.000
There is no alternative to faith – no substitute, no shortcut to faith.

0:21:11.000,0:21:16.200
Faith is the means of victory.

0:21:16.200,0:21:24.700
You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a total commitment to Jesus.

0:21:24.700,0:21:33.240
Total commitment is what Jesus requires through the Gospel because we serve God with our heart.

0:21:33.240,0:22:01.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:01.200,0:22:07.960
Partial commitment cannot defeat satan in battle.

0:22:07.960,0:22:20.800
That is why the Scripture says to you and I, “Watch and pray without ceasing”.

0:22:20.800,0:22:24.480
How do we watch and pray?

To watch and pray is to discipline your heart before you pray.

0:22:30.760,0:22:34.860
How do we discipline our heart?

0:22:34.860,0:22:37.660
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says to you and I

0:22:37.660,0:22:44.860
that when the Word of God dominates your mouth, it will dominate your heart.

0:22:44.860,0:22:49.800
When the Word dominates your heart, it will influence your behaviour, your conduct.

0:22:49.800,0:22:53.200
You will fear no more.

0:22:53.200,0:22:58.440
Controlling your mediation when you read the Bible,

0:22:58.440,0:23:03.920
that enables you to control your attitude, your utterances.

0:23:03.920,0:23:14.520
Say, “God’s Word refreshes my mind. God’s Spirit renews my strength”.

Now, this is the final battle.

0:23:52.480,0:23:56.880
Tell your neighbour, "This is the final battle".

0:23:56.880,0:24:05.440
Today, I have taken the decision to fear no more, to worry no more.

0:24:05.440,0:24:13.340
I know that all that has been happening to me was for a purpose.

0:24:13.340,0:24:17.940
Today, I am in the land of liberty.

0:24:17.940,0:24:23.580
Today, I believe Jesus Christ is alive.

0:24:23.580,0:24:29.340
I am here to declare the faithfulness of Christ in my life.

0:24:29.340,0:24:35.060
Victory, salvation is mine.

0:24:35.060,0:24:38.740
When you give a total commitment to Jesus,

0:24:38.740,0:24:44.280
Jesus will take up all the devil’s challenges against your life.

0:24:44.280,0:24:49.280
Today, I say to you: Congratulations!

0:24:49.280,0:24:52.320
Say, "Neighbour, congratulations!"

0:24:52.320,0:24:57.880
Shake your hands and say, "Congratulations! Thank you for not giving up!

0:24:57.880,0:25:00.040
Hold on to your faith.

0:25:00.040,0:25:10.060
Keep to your faith because any moment from now, you will see Jesus Christ at work in our midst".

0:25:10.060,0:25:16.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:16.200,0:25:21.880
Tell your neighbour, "Christianity is not a religion;

0:25:21.880,0:25:31.320
it is a relationship with the God of mercy, the God of compassion, the God of love".

0:25:31.320,0:25:36.920
So whoever you are here today, look to Him.

0:25:36.920,0:25:41.340
Engage your heart and give thanks to Him for His victory

0:25:41.340,0:25:45.660
because what you are about to receive is by pure grace.

0:25:45.660,0:25:49.000
He has won the battle for you and me.

0:25:49.000,0:25:51.500
He has made you worthy.

0:25:51.500,0:25:55.420
The devil has been lying to you so many times but today you know,

0:25:55.420,0:25:57.660
"I will declare God’s faithfulness".

0:25:57.660,0:26:00.200
May God bless His Word, in Jesus’ name.
