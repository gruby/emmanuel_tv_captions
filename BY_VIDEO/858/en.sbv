0:00:00.000,0:00:08.260
There is a man here; you are alleged that you killed a man.

0:00:08.260,0:00:10.260
I want you to come out.

0:00:10.260,0:00:16.380
Not only one; I see two children of yours who died in the process.

0:00:16.380,0:00:18.240
Come out.

0:00:18.240,0:00:23.000
Something happened. It's like you people were in the house.

0:00:23.000,0:00:26.120
Is it a new house? Are they celebrating in the house?

0:00:26.120,0:00:29.820
Which kind of occasion are they doing in a new house?

0:00:29.820,0:00:35.040
And something suddenly entered through the window and there was a storm.

0:00:35.040,0:00:39.620
Suddenly, almost three people died while they were praying.

0:00:39.620,0:00:43.040
Please, come out! Jesus loves you.

0:00:43.040,0:00:48.420
After Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered a detailed prophecy of a strange event that took place,

0:00:48.420,0:00:51.640
a man boldly marched out towards the prophet.

0:00:51.640,0:00:53.020
Let's listen to him.

0:00:53.020,0:00:56.020
My name is Ubong Emah Willie.

0:00:56.020,0:01:00.560
I'm from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:01:00.560,0:01:03.620
I bought land many years ago.

0:01:03.620,0:01:08.680
I built a house and roofed three rooms out of it.

0:01:08.680,0:01:10.960
Then I invited a man of God to come and pray.

0:01:10.960,0:01:16.040
Immediately the pastor began to pray, an evil spirit entered the house,

0:01:16.040,0:01:21.140
killing my two children. And the pastor also died.

0:01:21.140,0:01:23.140
Who are they saying is the cause?

0:01:23.140,0:01:25.780
They said that I was the cause.

0:01:25.780,0:01:27.460
And they want to kill you?

0:01:27.460,0:01:28.500
Yes.

0:01:28.500,0:01:37.760
I want to stand here and tell them that those who are responsible for that, they are there.

0:01:37.760,0:01:48.260
Not only will this issue be settled but they will be exposed.

0:01:48.260,0:01:56.340
Akwa Ibom people - thank God you people know what the Lord of T.B. Joshua can do.

0:01:56.340,0:02:01.160
Because they have seen it and not one, not two, not three.

0:02:01.160,0:02:06.460
I want to tell you that this man does not know anything.

0:02:06.460,0:02:10.300
Lord, thank You, Jesus. It's true.

0:02:10.300,0:02:15.820
He knows nothing about this death.

0:02:15.820,0:02:20.860
The person that sent that evil spirit is a poor person.

0:02:20.860,0:02:24.280
Right from the beginning, you had problems with the land.

0:02:24.280,0:02:26.960
Yes, any time I went to church, they would tell me that the land is not good.

0:02:26.960,0:02:29.120
I don't really know but my pastor would always pray.

0:02:29.120,0:02:30.480
I want to say something.

0:02:30.480,0:02:35.840
The pastor that went there to pray for you, he used his two legs to walk there?

0:02:35.840,0:02:36.520
Yes.

0:02:36.520,0:02:37.660
Was he sick before?

0:02:37.660,0:02:38.480
No.

0:02:38.480,0:02:39.220
Ha!

0:02:39.220,0:02:41.420
Even the two children of mine were not sick either.

0:02:41.420,0:02:42.700
Your children were not sick?

0:02:42.700,0:02:43.600
They were not sick.

0:02:43.600,0:02:45.000
Ok, it's alright.

0:02:45.000,0:02:49.060
This is a dangerous mission.

0:02:49.060,0:02:50.760
That is evil spirit for you.

0:02:50.760,0:02:54.500
If you cannot deliver them, they will deliver you.

0:02:54.500,0:02:58.660
When the man could not deliver them, they delivered him.

0:02:58.660,0:03:05.860
This man is not a wizard; he's purely nothing.

0:03:05.860,0:03:09.280
He is just a human being, just like you people.

0:03:09.280,0:03:14.720
After that thing had happened, there was a place they wanted you to go to.

0:03:14.720,0:03:17.460
You wanted to follow them but later, you said, "No".

0:03:17.460,0:03:20.440
That is why they said that you are the one who killed them.

0:03:20.440,0:03:22.660
I don't know what they call the place.

0:03:22.660,0:03:30.020
They said that I should come with them to a place but I refused to follow them.

0:03:30.020,0:03:35.640
The pastor you invited, that died in your house, what did you ask him to come and do for you?

0:03:35.640,0:03:38.560
I asked him to come and pray for me that I wanted to move into my new house.

0:03:38.560,0:03:41.060
Ok. You asked him to follow you to come and pray for you?

0:03:41.060,0:03:41.700
Yes.

0:03:41.700,0:03:43.000
Because you wanted to move into the house?

0:03:43.000,0:03:43.840
Yes.

0:03:43.840,0:03:45.460
Immediately they started praying...

0:03:45.460,0:03:47.680
...the evil spirit entered.

0:03:47.680,0:03:52.760
What kind of prayer did the pastor offer before the evil spirit entered?

0:03:52.760,0:03:54.300
The pastor said that the land was not good,

0:03:54.300,0:03:58.920
that there was an evil spirit there and that we should pray to God to ward it off.

0:03:58.920,0:04:01.560
I am a witness. I am from his village.

0:04:01.560,0:04:04.020
My name is Ikpe Friday, I am from his village.

0:04:04.020,0:04:10.120
We thought that he used his children for money rituals.

0:04:10.120,0:04:11.480
Ok. All the villagers?

0:04:11.480,0:04:15.040
All the villagers thought that he used the children for money rituals.

0:04:15.040,0:04:16.140
He did not use them for rituals.

0:04:16.140,0:04:21.720
Thank You, Jesus! Thank God!

0:04:21.720,0:04:24.840
Let's go.

0:04:24.840,0:04:26.560
To God be the glory!

0:04:26.560,0:04:32.200
The truth is further revealed as a man from Mr Ubong's village comes out to testify

0:04:32.200,0:04:35.420
that the prophecy given is nothing but the truth.

0:04:35.420,0:04:39.280
I am a brother to this man. He cannot speak well.

0:04:39.280,0:04:42.520
When this thing happened, the local Government Paramount Ruler sent

0:04:42.520,0:04:46.060
a committee and investigation committee on this matter.

0:04:46.060,0:04:51.140
The thing took us to Bayelsa State where we consulted a witch doctor,

0:04:51.140,0:04:53.380
though he did not go with us, I went.

0:04:53.380,0:04:56.680
The witch doctor said that the man was not involved,

0:04:56.680,0:04:58.760
that the problem came from the land.

0:04:58.760,0:05:01.580
By the time we came back to the village in Akwa Ibom State,

0:05:01.580,0:05:06.160
nobody believed; instead, they wanted to crucify this man. He ran.

0:05:06.160,0:05:10.120
Then at the end, the Paramount Ruler said that the only place he believed

0:05:10.120,0:05:13.500
that they would resolve this problem and by the time he said something,

0:05:13.500,0:05:25.460
everybody would believe was T.B. Joshua at The SCOAN.

0:05:25.460,0:05:34.400
O thank you people of Akwa Ibom. What an honour and what a privilege!

0:05:34.400,0:05:38.960
Thank you once again and I want to say to the people of Akwa Ibom,

0:05:38.960,0:05:45.960
any time I am praying, I will always remember you in prayer

0:05:45.960,0:05:49.580
for the honour and privilege given to me.

0:05:49.580,0:05:54.440
I know many things have happened in the past.

0:05:54.440,0:05:56.820
But for you to believe God,

0:05:56.820,0:06:02.480
that if I say something, it is from above, thank you very much for that.

0:06:02.480,0:06:07.960
So, you have someone praying for you.

0:06:07.960,0:06:11.320
So, you have been to many places?

0:06:11.320,0:06:15.280
Yes, of course. We went to a place in Bayelsa State.

0:06:15.280,0:06:16.820
What did they say?

0:06:16.820,0:06:19.780
The witch doctor said that this man was innocent,

0:06:19.780,0:06:21.500
though the man himself did not come.

0:06:21.500,0:06:26.300
By the time we came back, we told the chief in the village what the witch doctor said.

0:06:26.300,0:06:31.200
Nobody believed; instead they wanted to kill this man.

0:06:31.200,0:06:33.600
Already, the corpse of the pastor is not yet buried,

0:06:33.600,0:06:36.580
although his two kids have been buried.

0:06:36.580,0:06:42.900
The community now said that the son of that pastor should be a witness to our trip; he is seated there.

0:06:42.900,0:06:43.720
Where is the son?

0:06:43.720,0:06:45.260
The son of the pastor is at the back.

0:06:45.260,0:06:47.140
Please go and bring him.

0:06:47.140,0:06:49.360
Victor!

0:06:49.360,0:06:53.940
The son of the pastor is in the church here to witness the whole thing,

0:06:53.940,0:06:57.060
before they kill the man.

0:06:57.060,0:07:00.280
Victor, please come!

0:07:00.280,0:07:03.360
Let us watch the screen.

0:07:03.360,0:07:08.920
You have heard it from the man explaining as an eye witness all that happened in the village.

0:07:08.920,0:07:12.580
He said that when this matter came up, everyone in the village believed

0:07:12.580,0:07:15.900
that this man was responsible for the death of the pastor

0:07:15.900,0:07:18.500
and also had used his children for ritual.

0:07:18.500,0:07:22.300
They went to many places to investigate the cause of this

0:07:22.300,0:07:24.220
and they were told that this man was innocent

0:07:24.220,0:07:26.780
but no one believed it in the whole village

0:07:26.780,0:07:31.300
and that was how they all came together in the village...

0:07:31.300,0:07:35.060
This is the son of the late pastor and this man represents the Local Government.

0:07:35.060,0:07:37.760
He's the man the paramount ruler said should come with us,

0:07:37.760,0:07:41.660
while I represent the actual community where this thing happened.

0:07:41.660,0:07:43.360
Are you the son of the pastor?

0:07:43.360,0:07:44.880
Yes.

0:07:44.880,0:07:46.240
Okay.

0:07:46.240,0:07:49.980
So, we heard what happened to your father. Can you tell us what happened?

0:07:49.980,0:07:53.680
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:53.680,0:07:58.320
My name is Victor Anthony.

0:07:58.320,0:08:02.400
I so much thank God; God changed my life.

0:08:02.400,0:08:05.280
Before, I would do something like a mad person.

0:08:05.280,0:08:08.740
If I heard any problem, I would run there.

0:08:08.740,0:08:14.860
When I heard that my father was dead, I was annoyed -

0:08:14.860,0:08:17.220
I was annoyed with this guy.

0:08:17.220,0:08:20.280
When I asked my mum, she told me that this was the person

0:08:20.280,0:08:23.460
who came to invite my father to his house.

0:08:23.460,0:08:27.020
I asked, "How come he invited my father to his house? To do what?"

0:08:27.020,0:08:31.900
She said, "This man went to pick up prophets from different places

0:08:31.900,0:08:37.240
and then took my father to his house to pray for his house".

0:08:37.240,0:08:41.140
I asked, "What did the man put inside his house that he invited my father to come and pray over?"

0:08:41.140,0:08:44.700
God did not give my father the gift of prayer but a pastoral gift.

0:08:44.700,0:08:46.360
My father was a pastor.

0:08:46.360,0:08:48.940
Didn't I say that it was a dangerous mission.

0:08:48.940,0:08:50.500
You know that I said it?

0:08:50.500,0:08:53.940
I have never heard from him that his father was not a prayer warrior.

0:08:53.940,0:08:57.120
The son is saying that he never knew his father to be a prayer warrior.

0:08:57.120,0:09:02.120
Why should they call his father to come and pray?

0:09:02.120,0:09:05.160
She said this guy's two children died.

0:09:05.160,0:09:08.180
When I heard that, I was shocked.

0:09:08.180,0:09:10.660
They told me that my father was in the hospital.

0:09:10.660,0:09:14.060
I ran to the hospital to see my father; my father was dead.

0:09:14.060,0:09:15.940
I brought my father to the church.

0:09:15.940,0:09:18.820
They prayed for my father but there was no solution.

0:09:18.820,0:09:20.820
Some people came from other places.

0:09:20.820,0:09:25.720
Before then, I used to be hot-tempered.

0:09:25.720,0:09:30.820
People told me that we should go and burn the man's house and cause problems in the whole town.

0:09:30.820,0:09:36.920
I said, "No, let us do it like this, let us follow peace before anything".

0:09:36.920,0:09:40.900
Because I'm not like I used to be, so we tried to make peace.

0:09:40.900,0:09:44.480
I met the guy and they arranged to come and dress my father.

0:09:44.480,0:09:47.900
I even made a list of what this guy would use to bury my father.

0:09:47.900,0:09:52.120
And the list that I made was up to 4 million naira.

0:09:56.800,0:10:03.620
Can we just remain silent and hear God's will concerning this matter?

0:10:03.620,0:10:08.680
I said this because I asked my elders whether

0:10:08.680,0:10:11.440
anything like this had happened before. They said, "No".

0:10:11.440,0:10:13.440
Since I was born, I have never seen that kind of thing myself.

0:10:13.440,0:10:19.220
When a man of God goes to pray for a person and an evil power enters the house and kills people.

0:10:19.220,0:10:23.240
If you see those people and you are told that they were killed by an evil spirit,

0:10:23.240,0:10:26.340
you will never believe it; you will think that they were hit by a physical human being like me.

0:10:26.340,0:10:30.220
Because it was as if a heated piece of iron was used to beat them.

0:10:30.220,0:10:32.220
When such a piece of iron is used on a person, his skin would peel.

0:10:32.220,0:10:35.560
The two children of his that were hit by the evil spirit

0:10:35.560,0:10:38.580
were battered in the head and their brains spilled out.

0:10:38.580,0:10:43.240
If you saw them, you would not say that it was evil power that did this.

0:10:43.240,0:10:46.800
You would just say that it was a hired killer that had done it.

0:10:46.800,0:10:48.880
This thing happened in a way I do not understand.

0:10:48.880,0:10:51.440
That is why I said this guy should come and bury my father.

0:10:51.440,0:10:56.080
Even this place I came, people said that I shouldn't come here with him,

0:10:56.080,0:10:58.780
that I should just wait until he settled his problem

0:10:58.780,0:11:06.040
before he would come back and bury my father and take care of my late father's wife and children.

0:11:06.040,0:11:10.100
This is a very serious matter.

0:11:10.100,0:11:13.920
You can see the condition that followed.

0:11:13.920,0:11:18.860
Please, let us once and for all settle this matter.

0:11:18.860,0:11:25.080
One thing you people have to know, evil spirits, when they operate,

0:11:25.080,0:11:29.880
you will not see them but those who are in the spirit will see them.

0:11:29.880,0:11:33.120
They come out like a human being; they too use guns.

0:11:33.120,0:11:36.180
They can use a gun to kill too.

0:11:36.180,0:11:41.000
By the time the person dies, you will see the gunshot in the body.

0:11:41.000,0:11:44.120
They can use a cutlass but you will not see anybody.

0:11:44.120,0:11:50.640
But by the time the person lies down in body, you will see that it was a cutlass they used.

0:11:50.640,0:11:55.500
Sometimes, they may not use anything and the person will just die like that.

0:11:55.500,0:12:03.760
You will not see any trace of hitting, cutlass, knife but --

0:12:03.760,0:12:10.700
My brother, I want to declare to you that this brother is not a wizard.

0:12:10.700,0:12:17.920
So, there were some evil spirits that used that occasion to strike.

0:12:17.920,0:12:22.900
Now, concerning caring for your family and everything,

0:12:22.900,0:12:25.040
I don't want you to attach any condition.

0:12:25.040,0:12:28.300
I want to meet you so that we iron everything out.

0:12:28.300,0:12:32.780
But what matters is that this man is not the one that killed your father.

0:12:32.780,0:12:35.140
He is not an evil spirit; he is not a wizard.

0:12:35.140,0:12:40.380
I thank people in Akwa Ibom for bringing this matter here today.

0:12:40.380,0:12:42.180
I am very happy with them.

0:12:42.180,0:12:50.060
When I leave here today, I am going to pray for the State, Akwa Ibom.

0:12:50.060,0:12:52.820
This man is not a wizard.

0:12:52.820,0:12:56.280
He is not the one who killed your father. He is innocent.

0:12:56.280,0:13:00.020
But I will join you and your family; let's see what we can do.

0:13:00.020,0:13:03.800
He will not just fold his hands; he also has to support your family, do something.

0:13:03.800,0:13:07.020
But not by condition, since he is not the one who killed.

0:13:07.020,0:13:11.020
He must do something but I want to join force to support your family,

0:13:11.020,0:13:20.520
pray with your family and help your family financially and spiritually to restore the house.

0:13:20.520,0:13:23.680
Thank You, Jesus. God loves me.

0:13:23.680,0:13:26.220
How many junior brothers do you have?

0:13:26.220,0:13:28.980
I have six.

0:13:28.980,0:13:33.400
Please, the words of mouth cannot just settle this matter like that.

0:13:33.400,0:13:38.740
I want to relieve this man from the condition, since he is not the one that killed your father.

0:13:38.740,0:13:45.040
In order to give him a great relief so that he will be out of this stiff condition,

0:13:45.040,0:13:50.000
personally, I am going to give you N500,000.

0:13:50.000,0:13:53.560
Thank You, Jesus.

0:13:53.560,0:14:00.660
So, if this man gives you N50,000, N100,000, please take it

0:14:00.660,0:14:04.160
because he is not the one that killed your father.

0:14:04.160,0:14:07.680
He will show love to really show

0:14:07.680,0:14:13.000
that he is really sorry for inviting your father for prayer and whatever.

0:14:13.000,0:14:14.580
He will feel what you feel.

0:14:14.580,0:14:17.600
But giving you N500,000 is a way of telling you

0:14:17.600,0:14:22.640
that you should remove that condition - that he must do this, he must do that - remove it.

0:14:22.640,0:14:28.520
So please, personally, I want to see your mum, your family and your children.

0:14:28.520,0:14:31.120
So, personally, this is my support.

0:14:31.120,0:14:38.560
I will give the family N500,000 to start something and put the matter behind them.

0:14:38.560,0:14:44.860
Brother, see the work your father went there to do as the work of God.

0:14:44.860,0:14:47.780
The nature of death does not matter.

0:14:47.780,0:14:55.120
Whether they kill you by plane crash or they crucify you or behead you,

0:14:55.120,0:15:03.320
what matters is the righteousness of God.

0:15:03.320,0:15:08.020
Two: The age at which we die does not matter.

0:15:08.020,0:15:13.160
Whether you are young or old, you are this, you are that, that does not matter.

0:15:13.160,0:15:15.780
The righteousness of God is the one that matters.

0:15:15.780,0:15:17.480
I want you to respect your father.

0:15:17.480,0:15:23.880
He went on a mission to pray and for your father to rest in peace,

0:15:23.880,0:15:27.300
please take it in that way - that he went on a mission.

0:15:27.300,0:15:29.800
Whether he was a prayer warrior or not, he went on a mission

0:15:29.800,0:15:33.960
to pray for somebody and in the process, something happened.

0:15:33.960,0:15:35.840
Say, "Glory be to God!"

0:15:35.840,0:15:39.900
But what matters, if this man is a wizard, I will tell you.

0:15:39.900,0:15:41.340
Now, I will tell you.

0:15:41.340,0:15:47.920
But I see nothing. He is not a wizard; he is nobody.

0:15:47.920,0:15:50.780
Thank you, Man of God.

0:15:50.780,0:15:56.460
That house, without deliverance, if another person enters that place again,

0:15:56.460,0:16:01.360
the same thing will happen. I am telling you, the same thing will happen.

0:16:01.360,0:16:05.860
Somebody was buried there before you built the house. There is a grave there.

0:16:05.860,0:16:09.720
We were told that 50 people would die inside that house.

0:16:09.720,0:16:13.240
For your information, the place needs to be sanctified.

0:16:13.240,0:16:18.360
If not, another person will die.

0:16:18.360,0:16:24.880
I want to pray for the people of Akwa-Ibom, the king there in the community and the council.

0:16:24.880,0:16:30.900
Thank you very much for this matter, for the soul and the peace we allow to reign

0:16:30.900,0:16:33.640
and also for coming to the root of the matter.

0:16:33.640,0:16:35.680
This man is not a wizard.

0:16:35.680,0:16:40.460
If he is a wizard, I will just tell you and he will be delivered. Simple.

0:16:40.460,0:16:43.540
Even if he is a wizard - I will tell you he is a wizard, I will deliver him.

0:16:43.540,0:16:47.260
I will come to the village and say, "Look leave him, he is already delivered".

0:16:47.260,0:16:50.480
So, the answer is not to kill the wizard but to deliver them.

0:16:50.480,0:16:55.340
But looking at him, I cannot see anything to be delivered, he is not a wizard.

0:16:55.340,0:16:58.000
Therefore, he is innocent; he doesn't know anything.

0:16:58.000,0:17:03.760
There is a pot in that place. They buried a pot; there is a charm there.

0:17:03.760,0:17:06.700
It works with thunder.

0:17:06.700,0:17:14.820
SHOCKING: Did This Man Kill His Own Children???

0:17:14.820,0:17:22.820
I want to meet the family, hand over my N500,000 and also support the family.

0:17:22.820,0:17:28.360
This man, like I have said, is just innocent.

0:17:28.360,0:17:34.580
They should pray for him because he's confused, so that he will not run mental.

0:17:34.580,0:17:36.880
They are trying him now.

0:17:36.880,0:17:38.440
He has been crying throughout the night.

0:17:38.440,0:17:40.440
This man? - Yes.

0:17:40.440,0:17:42.720
Because I see that he wants to run mental. When he runs mental,

0:17:42.720,0:17:44.720
they will now say that he is the one that killed them.

0:17:44.720,0:17:48.500
Whereas it is depression - depression wants to kill him.

0:17:48.500,0:17:53.780
He is not normal anymore. You will see him, he will be talking alone.

0:17:53.780,0:17:56.540
He needs to be delivered.

0:17:56.540,0:18:01.660
PROPHECY CONFIRMATION

0:18:01.660,0:18:04.540
My name is Ubong Emah Willie.

0:18:04.540,0:18:10.180
I come from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:18:10.180,0:18:17.460
The man of God prophesied that there was a man here

0:18:17.460,0:18:20.640
whose two children died.

0:18:20.640,0:18:23.080
He said that one of the pastors also died.

0:18:23.080,0:18:30.960
The man of God also prophesied that I called a man of God to come and pray in my house.

0:18:30.960,0:18:34.860
Immediately he started to pray, an evil spirit entered the house

0:18:34.860,0:18:38.820
and killed two of my children and the pastor.

0:18:38.820,0:18:47.060
There is a man here; you are alleged that you killed a man.

0:18:47.060,0:18:49.200
I want you to come out.

0:18:49.200,0:18:55.360
Not only one; I see two children of yours who died in the process.

0:18:55.360,0:18:57.080
Come out.

0:18:57.080,0:18:58.860
Something happened.

0:18:58.860,0:19:01.980
It's like, you people were in the house.

0:19:01.980,0:19:05.000
Is it a new house? Are they celebrating in the house?

0:19:05.000,0:19:08.720
Which kind of occasion are they doing in a new house?

0:19:08.720,0:19:14.000
And something suddenly entered through the window, and there was a storm.

0:19:14.000,0:19:18.540
Suddenly, almost three people died while they were praying.

0:19:18.540,0:19:22.200
Please, come out! Jesus loves you.

0:19:22.200,0:19:26.780
So, everything the man of God said is true.

0:19:26.780,0:19:32.780
So now, can you confirm to us this prophecy from the man of God.

0:19:32.780,0:19:36.980
Why did you say the prophecy of the man of God is true for your life? What happened?

0:19:36.980,0:19:43.300
The prophecy of the man of God is very true because the thing happened just like that.

0:19:43.300,0:19:46.120
Immediately we entered the house, we started to pray.

0:19:46.120,0:19:48.420
An evil spirit entered the house.

0:19:48.420,0:19:53.600
All of us fell down; then two children of mine died.

0:19:53.600,0:19:55.320
Then the pastor died also.

0:19:55.320,0:19:58.520
The other people sustained injuries, even I also had an injury.

0:19:58.520,0:20:02.260
Something beat us but we couldn't see it physically.

0:20:02.260,0:20:06.580
So, the prophecy of the man of God is very, very true.

0:20:06.580,0:20:09.540
Since after that incident happened,

0:20:09.540,0:20:13.160
can you tell us what happened to you in the village, in the community?

0:20:13.160,0:20:18.260
I was accused of killing my two children and the pastor.

0:20:18.260,0:20:21.060
So, they wanted to kill me but I escaped.

0:20:21.060,0:20:25.180
Later, the head of the village advised me to come back.

0:20:25.180,0:20:32.940
Later, the head of the clan told me to get N100,000

0:20:32.940,0:20:39.700
and travel to Lagos - four of us - to meet the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:39.700,0:20:45.480
Ok. So, you mean this was the problem that brought you to The SCOAN, all the way from Akwa Ibom State?

0:20:45.480,0:20:46.480
Yes.

0:20:46.480,0:20:51.640
Ok. Now we want to listen to the people standing beside you. Who are these people?

0:20:51.640,0:20:58.400
They are my brothers who the villagers assigned to accompany me to Lagos.

0:20:58.400,0:21:03.000
Ok. Let us listen to the men who are with you.

0:21:03.000,0:21:06.080
Can you please tell us your name and where you come from.

0:21:06.080,0:21:10.140
My name is Imoh Akpan Phenson.

0:21:10.140,0:21:15.880
I am from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:21:15.880,0:21:21.960
When this ugly incident happened, the whole community was in chaos.

0:21:21.960,0:21:26.400
The clan head then set an investigation committee to investigate

0:21:26.400,0:21:29.460
what had happened; that he had never seen this kind of thing before.

0:21:29.460,0:21:36.560
Actually, we have consulted a witch doctor at Bonni Local Government area of Rivers State.

0:21:36.560,0:21:40.100
We have consulted so many prophets and pastors.

0:21:40.100,0:21:45.260
All the revelations have always been that there is a problem in the land

0:21:45.260,0:21:47.640
on which this man built the house.

0:21:47.640,0:21:52.840
So, nobody believed this; the community never believed.

0:21:52.840,0:21:59.660
At the end, the clan head, having set up a committee, asked the man in question

0:21:59.660,0:22:05.800
Mr Ubong Emma Willie, the owner of the house, to find at least N100,000

0:22:05.800,0:22:09.360
so that we could take a trip to The SCOAN and see the man of God

0:22:09.360,0:22:12.940
and that whatever the man of God said about this, everybody would believe it.

0:22:12.940,0:22:17.040
This thing happened in a town hall meeting, a community hall,

0:22:17.040,0:22:19.160
that was where the decision was taken.

0:22:19.160,0:22:25.000
You mean all the reports given were not believed by the members of the community?

0:22:25.000,0:22:29.420
Yes. Nobody in the community believed that this man was innocent.

0:22:29.420,0:22:34.460
But by the time we arrived at The SCOAN, it was a very surprising thing

0:22:34.460,0:22:38.860
to see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prophesying that there is a man

0:22:38.860,0:22:45.240
from Akwa Ibom State who is being accused of killing his two children

0:22:45.240,0:22:49.560
and a man, totalling three people, that the man should come out.

0:22:49.560,0:22:55.680
My brother, Mr Ubong, came out and the man of God even prophesied

0:22:55.680,0:22:59.360
that we have been to so many places including a native doctor's.

0:22:59.360,0:23:01.220
So, it was a surprising thing to me.

0:23:01.220,0:23:04.200
That's why I have to believe all that the man of God has said.

0:23:04.200,0:23:09.000
He has said that there is a poor man in the community.

0:23:09.000,0:23:14.780
The owners of the land have buried a pot in the ground.

0:23:14.780,0:23:21.320
That the pot is bringing all these upheavals in the house.

0:23:21.320,0:23:25.940
That if the house is not sanctified before living in it,

0:23:25.940,0:23:28.260
more people will still die.

0:23:28.260,0:23:30.560
That was the prophecy of the man of God.

0:23:30.560,0:23:34.340
Even as we are here, the clan head has even called us

0:23:34.340,0:23:37.820
that he had been watching us live; that the whole community too was watching.

0:23:37.820,0:23:42.240
We have been receiving phone calls since the prophecy of the man of God.

0:23:42.240,0:23:47.120
They have received thousands of phone calls from members of the community

0:23:47.120,0:23:54.920
and even from the clan head himself, who initiated this movement to The SCOAN,

0:23:54.920,0:23:58.260
that they have heard the voice of God

0:23:58.260,0:24:03.720
and indeed they believe that what the man of God said was nothing but the truth.

0:24:03.720,0:24:05.840
Can you tell us who the man next to you is?

0:24:05.840,0:24:11.580
The man next to me is the son of the late pastor, who is brought by the community as a witness

0:24:11.580,0:24:15.560
so that he will also believe what the man of God will say.

0:24:15.560,0:24:19.640
Right now let us listen to our gentleman here.

0:24:19.640,0:24:22.260
Can you please introduce yourself to us.

0:24:22.260,0:24:25.200
My name is Victor Anthony Kiddy.

0:24:25.200,0:24:30.780
I am the son of the late pastor.

0:24:30.780,0:24:41.560
I came here on a visit to hear what the man of God will say about this man who fell a victim.

0:24:41.560,0:24:47.500
I came here to know how this guy killed my father.

0:24:47.500,0:24:52.980
But the man of God let me know that this man is innocent.

0:24:52.980,0:24:59.260
As for me, I love God, so what the man of God told me, I believe it.

0:24:59.260,0:25:02.040
Because God cannot tell lies.

0:25:02.040,0:25:07.540
Now the man of God told me to leave the accused man alone

0:25:07.540,0:25:18.900
and he promised to give me N500,000 and also to take care of my family.

0:25:18.900,0:25:23.800
So now I believe what the man of God said that this man is innocent.

0:25:23.800,0:25:27.380
I believe because God cannot tell lies.

0:25:27.380,0:25:31.800
I am Uyoata Ndeayo Uttah.

0:25:31.800,0:25:40.940
I am a representative of the clan.

0:25:40.940,0:25:51.500
With absolute humility and respect to God Almighty and Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:25:51.500,0:25:54.240
for what I have seen today.

0:25:54.240,0:26:01.400
Brethren, the story you have heard and the revelation you have seen today are wonderful.

0:26:01.400,0:26:06.800
I want to believe since we have witnessed that wonderful revelation,

0:26:06.800,0:26:10.280
we will still go back home and tell people.

0:26:10.280,0:26:12.280
I think so many people will believe.

0:26:12.280,0:26:19.840
I also want to thank the clan head, whom through his rulership, has sent us to this place.

0:26:19.840,0:26:24.800
He has really informed us that when we come to this place,

0:26:24.800,0:26:27.180
the truth about this matter will be revealed.

0:26:27.180,0:26:32.300
So I want to thank God and thank the man of God for having that privilege

0:26:32.300,0:26:35.180
and that opportunity to listen to us.

0:26:35.180,0:26:40.860
Today, we have seen the truth and the truth has been told.

0:26:40.860,0:26:43.480
To God be the glory! We thank God for everything.

0:26:43.480,0:26:46.680
Let us hear from this man. Tell us your name.

0:26:46.680,0:26:48.440
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:26:48.440,0:26:51.720
My name is Ikpe Friday.

0:26:51.720,0:26:55.880
I am from Akwa Ibom (Nigeria).

0:26:55.880,0:27:00.340
I was down there, when I heard this prophecy.

0:27:00.340,0:27:08.400
The man of God said there is a man that built a house, they went to pray in the house --

0:27:08.400,0:27:12.880
So you mean you were in the church when the man of God prophecied to this young man?

0:27:12.880,0:27:14.480
Tell us what happened after that.

0:27:14.480,0:27:19.140
Immediately when I heard it, I ran out because it concerns me.

0:27:19.140,0:27:22.900
We thought this guy used his children for rituals, for money making.

0:27:22.900,0:27:26.260
I am from that community, I witnessed everything that happened.

0:27:26.260,0:27:31.160
Evil spirits entered the house and killed two of his children on the spot.

0:27:31.160,0:27:35.780
So, we were so surprised; we thought he used the children for money rituals.

0:27:35.780,0:27:39.080
I personally thank God that we have to got to know the truth;

0:27:39.080,0:27:44.900
the truth has come out today so that we now know this man is innocent.

0:27:44.900,0:27:48.980
Thank you very much. Indeed, we thank God for this wonderful prophecy

0:27:48.980,0:27:52.000
that has come today and the truth that has been revealed.

0:27:52.000,0:27:59.560
As the spirit of God has spoken, we also thank God that everyone concerned in this matter

0:27:59.560,0:28:05.340
has heeded the voice of God and believed that the man of God has spoken the mind of God

0:28:05.340,0:28:07.080
concerning this situation,

0:28:07.080,0:28:14.480
and we want to give glory to God Almighty for the peace He has brought in this issue today.

0:28:14.480,0:28:19.180
Thank you all also for taking the time to come here to find out the truth.

0:28:19.180,0:28:24.400
Thank you very much. God bless you.

0:28:24.400,0:28:30.760
As directed by Prophet T.B. Joshua, the following Sunday, Mr Ubong is at The SCOAN

0:28:30.760,0:28:35.220
with the late pastor's wife, son and some village representatives

0:28:35.220,0:28:38.960
who were present when the evil attack took place.

0:28:38.960,0:28:41.880
My name is Ubong Emah Willie.

0:28:41.880,0:28:46.340
I come from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:28:46.340,0:28:53.600
Last week Sunday, I was in The SCOAN.

0:28:53.600,0:28:59.580
The man of God prophesied that there was a man here from Akwa Ibom

0:28:59.580,0:29:10.660
who built a house and called a pastor to pray in the new house.

0:29:10.660,0:29:17.420
Then an evil spirit entered through the window, killed his children and the pastor.

0:29:17.420,0:29:25.720
There is a man here; you are alleged that you killed a man.

0:29:25.720,0:29:27.720
I want you to come out.

0:29:27.720,0:29:33.840
Not only one; I see two children of yours who died in the process.

0:29:33.840,0:29:35.680
Come out.

0:29:35.680,0:29:37.460
Something happened.

0:29:37.460,0:29:40.480
It's like, you people were in the house.

0:29:40.480,0:29:43.600
Is it a new house? Are they celebrating in the house?

0:29:43.600,0:29:47.220
Which kind of occasion are they doing in a new house?

0:29:47.220,0:29:52.540
And something suddenly entered through the window and there was a storm.

0:29:52.540,0:29:57.140
Suddenly, almost three people died while they were praying.

0:29:57.140,0:30:00.640
Please come out! Jesus loves you.

0:30:00.640,0:30:04.580
What the man of God said is true.

0:30:04.580,0:30:09.260
I bought land and built a house on it.

0:30:09.260,0:30:16.520
Then I called a pastor to come and pray for me because I wanted to move into the new house.

0:30:16.520,0:30:25.220
As we began to pray, an evil spirit entered the house and killed two of my children.

0:30:25.220,0:30:31.100
We were all beaten but we couldn't see the person who beat us.

0:30:31.100,0:30:35.280
There was a flood of water inside the room where we were praying.

0:30:35.280,0:30:37.720
Then all of us fell down.

0:30:37.720,0:30:44.480
Even my brother fell down and his hand was wounded.

0:30:44.480,0:30:50.300
So, we took the pastor to the church, from the church to the hospital,

0:30:50.300,0:30:55.720
from the hospital back to the church. Then later, the pastor died.

0:30:55.720,0:31:05.020
After the death of the pastor, I was accused of using my children and the pastor for a money ritual.

0:31:05.020,0:31:16.840
So, the entire village and the clan said I killed my children and the pastor.

0:31:16.840,0:31:19.320
They wanted to kill me.

0:31:19.320,0:31:22.400
I ran away from the village.

0:31:22.400,0:31:31.860
After I had left, the village head later sent a message to me through my in-law

0:31:31.860,0:31:36.260
that anywhere I was, I should come back. Then I came back.

0:31:36.260,0:31:42.380
Then the village head told me that the only place where the truth could come out

0:31:42.380,0:31:51.960
was through Prophet T.B. Josua at The SCOAN.

0:31:51.960,0:31:54.860
So, on Sunday, I entered the church.

0:31:54.860,0:31:58.200
Immediately I entered the church, I started praying to God

0:31:58.200,0:32:02.280
that God should come and visit me and open my file.

0:32:02.280,0:32:09.420
Immediately I started to pray in my heart, Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God, prophesied

0:32:09.420,0:32:17.040
that there is a man here from Akwa Ibom who bought a land and built a house.

0:32:17.040,0:32:22.500
Then this man called a pastor there to exorcise the house.

0:32:22.500,0:32:30.220
Then an evil spirit entered, killing two children of his and the pastor.

0:32:30.220,0:32:35.920
That person is here and he should come out.

0:32:35.920,0:32:39.780
So, I stood up and shouted that it was me.

0:32:39.780,0:32:42.940
Then the man of God told me everything,

0:32:42.940,0:32:50.200
saying that I was not the one who killed them; that I was innocent.

0:32:50.200,0:32:52.300
Emmanuel!

My name is Victor Anthony Kiddy.

0:32:55.360,0:32:59.020
I am the son of the late pastor.

0:32:59.020,0:33:03.340
This is my stepmother, the pastor's wife.

0:33:03.340,0:33:11.000
What brought me here is to listen to what God has to say about this man who killed my father.

0:33:11.000,0:33:19.200
When I came here, God used the man of God to speak to me that the man is innocent.

0:33:19.200,0:33:25.420
And I believe because what God told me is not a lie.

0:33:25.420,0:33:33.400
I had planned that even if this man is innocent or a victim,

0:33:33.400,0:33:37.680
he would give me 4 million naira to bury my father.

0:33:37.680,0:33:43.380
But now, God used the man of God to help him to take care of my father's burial.

0:33:43.380,0:33:49.000
I so much thank God for what He used the man of God to do for me.

0:33:49.000,0:33:51.880
My name is Uyoata Ndeayo Uttah.

0:33:56.000,0:33:59.340
in Nna Local Government, Akwa Ibom State.

0:33:59.340,0:34:07.000
And here standing close to me is the wife of the pastor that died during the incident.

0:34:07.000,0:34:09.600
She will speak in our local language; then I will interpret.

0:34:09.600,0:34:11.000
Thank you.

She said she is Comfort Anthony Kiddy from Nna Local Government, Akwa Ibom State.

0:34:26.140,0:34:30.080
I was there in the house.

0:34:30.080,0:34:36.260
My husband told me that he wanted to go and pray.

0:34:36.260,0:34:40.580
My close friend.

0:34:40.580,0:34:48.340
I waited in my house for two days. My husband never came back.

0:34:48.340,0:34:56.640
For three days, I waited and waited but he never came back home.

0:34:56.640,0:35:00.480
I never knew he was taken to the hospital.

0:35:00.480,0:35:08.180
I went to the hospital and brought him back to the church.

0:35:08.180,0:35:15.420
The following Friday, my husband died - the pastor.

0:35:15.420,0:35:34.520
Since then, I have not been able to do anything;

0:35:34.520,0:35:41.860
rather, I have been weeping and weeping and I have decided to leave everything to God Almighty.

0:35:41.860,0:35:50.860
But on Sunday, when I was informed about the happening in my village

0:35:50.860,0:36:00.140
and later, that the accused person was innocent,

0:36:00.140,0:36:09.240
I could not do anything. I decided to leave everything for God.

0:36:09.240,0:36:25.960
My beloved brethren, I thank the man of God because what I initially thought

0:36:25.960,0:36:33.880
was that Mr Ubong Emah would bury my husband and take care of my family

0:36:33.880,0:36:37.340
and do everything for my family.

0:36:37.340,0:36:43.920
But when I was told last Sunday, I realised that this man is innocent.

0:36:43.920,0:36:47.300
I thank God and I thank the man of God, in Jesus' name.

0:36:47.300,0:37:05.600
Please, what I want to tell my Christian brethren is that Mr Ubong

0:37:05.600,0:37:13.340
will take care of my mother's burial which my late husband was supposed to have done.

0:37:13.340,0:37:18.880
That is what I want him to do.

0:37:18.880,0:37:21.440
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:37:21.440,0:37:27.860
I am Bassey Monday Udoh from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:37:27.860,0:37:32.240
One day, I was sitting in my shop when I heard a call,

0:37:32.240,0:37:37.000
"Brother, come; please, I want to see you immediately.

0:37:37.000,0:37:39.520
Wherever you are, I will pay for your transport".

0:37:39.520,0:37:45.040
So, I decided to rush down. On my way, I met this relation of mine.

0:37:45.040,0:37:48.140
So, I followed him into his house.

0:37:48.140,0:37:52.300
When we got to his house, I saw people who came to pray.

0:37:52.300,0:37:54.120
All of them are my friends; I know them.

0:37:54.120,0:37:57.800
When we were praying, an evil spirit came in and beat us

0:37:57.800,0:38:03.040
and gave me a very big wound as a result of which

0:38:03.040,0:38:05.040
I cannot raise up my hand up 'til now.

0:38:05.040,0:38:10.160
I cannot use my hand to write or do anything.

0:38:10.160,0:38:13.000
This is making two months and three weeks.

0:38:13.000,0:38:17.160
I use my left hand to eat; I cannot take my bath.

0:38:17.160,0:38:20.980
So, what happened to me in that house was that when we were praying,

0:38:20.980,0:38:25.360
an evil spirit came in the form of wind.

0:38:25.360,0:38:31.800
Then the thing was like tear gas whereby no one could open their eyes.

0:38:31.800,0:38:34.320
So, everybody fainted.

0:38:34.320,0:38:36.920
We didn't know where we were.

0:38:36.920,0:38:40.360
This man said, "Let us go and open the door".

0:38:40.360,0:38:47.960
He tried to open the door seven times; the door would not open again until 5pm,

0:38:47.960,0:38:51.360
before this guy took us to the church.

0:38:51.360,0:38:59.660
What happened to my hand is that they used a hammer to destroy my hand.

0:38:59.660,0:39:07.500
Up 'til now, I cannot bend my hand or touch anything.

0:39:07.500,0:39:13.980
The same evil spirit has destroyed my hair.

0:39:13.980,0:39:19.100
Up 'til now, my hair cannot grow on this spot anymore.

0:39:19.100,0:39:24.880
We have listened to their testimony, their confession.

0:39:24.880,0:39:34.900
Mummy, we invited you here today to let you know that this man is just innocent.

0:39:34.900,0:39:38.960
There is nothing like witchcraft in him.

0:39:38.960,0:39:45.600
So, someone is somewhere perpetrating this evil.

0:39:45.600,0:39:53.000
So, like I have said, I will support the family.

0:39:53.000,0:39:58.320
Don't cry; you just take me as your brother and son.

0:39:58.320,0:40:05.600
I will be part of your family.

0:40:05.600,0:40:09.940
From now on, you just call me in position of your husband -

0:40:09.940,0:40:17.380
whatever you feel your husband was supposed to have done or would do if alive.

0:40:17.380,0:40:23.640
So, call me; I will come into the matter.

0:40:23.640,0:40:27.520
Just let this man be free and forget about that

0:40:27.520,0:40:33.500
since he does not possess evil powers and he is innocent.

0:40:33.500,0:40:35.400
So, we should not bother him.

0:40:35.400,0:40:41.960
As a Christian, he should be coming to visit you and also see you as part of the family

0:40:41.960,0:40:47.180
but nothing should be compelled or forced on him.

0:40:47.180,0:40:51.580
So, I'm going to support the family. I know you have many children.

0:40:51.580,0:40:58.880
I'm going to support your family with N500,000.

0:40:58.880,0:41:04.440
Okay.

0:41:14.240,0:41:16.800
He is the father, he is the husband now.

0:41:16.800,0:41:25.840
So, I'm indirectly telling you that I'm going to join you. Okay?

0:41:25.840,0:41:29.860
After blessing the family of the deceased with half a million naira,

0:41:29.860,0:41:34.000
Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the son and his mother.

0:41:34.000,0:41:40.140

0:41:40.140,0:41:44.480
So that you will be able to stand as the head of the home.

0:41:44.480,0:41:49.540
He prays for the son to enable him to stand, now as the head of the home.

0:41:49.540,0:41:57.560
That is Mr Ubong himself receiving deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:41:57.560,0:41:59.140
Who is this man?

0:41:59.140,0:42:02.220
This man is one of the victims.

0:42:02.220,0:42:03.300
Is he a pastor?

0:42:03.300,0:42:06.620
No, he is not a pastor; he is one of those who participated in the prayer.

0:42:06.620,0:42:08.900
Are you a prayer warrior?

0:42:08.900,0:42:11.500
I'm not a prayer warrior. This man is my relation.

0:42:11.500,0:42:12.680
We are from the same family.

0:42:12.680,0:42:14.820
You went there to do what?

0:42:14.820,0:42:16.820
We were there together.

0:42:16.820,0:42:18.000
To clap hands?

0:42:18.000,0:42:20.000
At least, to clap hands.

0:42:26.700,0:42:30.200
He said he went there to clap hands.

0:42:30.200,0:42:32.520
To eat rice or what?

0:42:32.520,0:42:42.600
I went there to pray with those who came to dedicate the house.

0:42:42.600,0:42:45.500
You have been doing that in the past?

0:42:45.500,0:42:51.180
Yes, when I was in the prayer band in the Apostolic Church.

0:42:51.180,0:42:53.100
That time, I was in secondary school.

0:42:53.100,0:42:58.960
So, we used to go to people's shops - to dedicate their shops.

0:42:58.960,0:43:02.000
After that, we would go back to the church.

0:43:02.000,0:43:04.000
Thank God you are here to hear the voice of God.

0:43:04.000,0:43:10.900
This man is not responsible for the death of your husband. He is just a victim.

0:43:10.900,0:43:13.640
He is not a wizard.

0:43:13.640,0:43:15.880
This man should be free.

0:43:15.880,0:43:20.360
At the same time, your husband was a pastor.

0:43:20.360,0:43:25.060
You should accept that he went for the call of God.

0:43:25.060,0:43:30.580
If you don't believe that, it means you don't believe your husband was a pastor.

0:43:30.580,0:43:39.520
You should see the death of your husband as a blessing because he was a pastor.

0:44:22.100,0:44:25.060
They should put this money in the bank. I will continue to support them.

0:44:25.060,0:44:32.760
Make sure the children go to school; and take care of the house.

0:44:54.540,0:44:59.700
how much can buy the soul and the body?

0:44:59.700,0:45:02.980
Because that would have been the penalty.

0:45:02.980,0:45:07.660
What we are doing is to send you back to the city and your community.

0:45:07.660,0:45:09.660
Help the needy.

0:45:09.660,0:45:17.140
There's no amount of money given that is enough for what God is using us to settle.

0:45:17.140,0:45:20.140
This is what would have taken life.

0:45:20.140,0:45:22.700
But God used us to settle the matter.

0:45:22.700,0:45:33.340
How much is N500,000? It is small money but for us to settle the matter, glory be to God.

0:45:33.340,0:45:35.540
There is no case anymore.

0:45:35.540,0:45:37.540
Glory be to God.

0:45:55.760,0:46:05.280
My heart is full of joy because I didn't expect that when I come here,

0:46:05.280,0:46:10.240
the man of God would prophesy that I am innocent.

0:46:10.240,0:46:17.860
So, I am very, very happy for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:46:17.860,0:46:28.000
Then on Wednesday, the man of God called us and gave us N45,000 for transport home

0:46:28.000,0:46:31.400
to bring the late pastor's wife.

0:46:31.400,0:46:35.020
So, I am happy; I am very, very happy.

0:46:35.020,0:46:45.660
I thank my God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for delivering me.

0:46:45.660,0:46:48.920
My name is Victor Anthony Kiddy.

0:46:48.920,0:46:52.860
I so much thank God for what He has done for me.

0:46:52.860,0:46:56.060
He used the man of God to speak well to me.

0:46:56.060,0:47:01.980
He said that the man I wanted to hang is innocent.

0:47:01.980,0:47:05.540
I believe what God said to me.

0:47:05.540,0:47:09.920
I cannot deny it. I will believe what God said.

0:47:09.920,0:47:14.420
He gave me N500,000 to go and do my father's burial.

0:47:14.420,0:47:16.180
I so much thank God.

0:47:16.180,0:47:25.600
He also told me that he's going to take care of my family and my father's wife.

0:47:25.600,0:47:27.860
I'm so happy.

0:47:27.860,0:47:31.020
The man of God gave me money to go and do the burial

0:47:31.020,0:47:36.120
and take care of my brothers and my father's wife.

0:47:36.120,0:47:43.600
I am Uyoata Ndeayo Uttah from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:47:43.600,0:47:50.280
I am a representative of the clan.

0:47:50.280,0:47:57.900
Beloved Christian brethren, I thank God with absolute humility and honour to God Almighty

0:47:57.900,0:48:04.540
and the Prophet of God, the communicator, the mediator, the prophet in God's vineyard.

0:48:04.540,0:48:12.440
I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for the wonderful prophecy he has given in this case.

0:48:12.440,0:48:18.780
Beloved brethren, we came here last Sunday and we saw what happened.

0:48:18.780,0:48:24.220
When we went back to the village, everybody was convinced.

0:48:24.220,0:48:28.240
Now it is clear that the truth has been spoken.

0:48:28.240,0:48:32.900
It has cleared everybody's mind in our local government and the clan.

0:48:32.900,0:48:38.180
When we went back to the village the other time, it was celebration galore.

0:48:38.180,0:48:42.440
Everybody was happy about the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:48:42.440,0:48:46.320
So, I thank God for that in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:48:46.320,0:48:54.820
They accepted in good faith that what the man of God prophesied was correct and the truth.

0:48:54.820,0:48:58.980
That Mr Ubong is innocent.

0:48:58.980,0:49:01.100
So you are here in the service today

0:49:01.100,0:49:06.600
and you witnessed what the anointed man of God did for the family of the late pastor.

0:49:06.600,0:49:08.700
What do you have to say about that?

0:49:08.700,0:49:14.180
Yes, I am very, very glad about what I have seen today -

0:49:14.180,0:49:20.420
the presentation of N500,000 to the family of the deceased, the pastor.

0:49:20.420,0:49:23.680
I thank God because it is not easy.

0:49:23.680,0:49:26.340
Even politicians cannot do this.

0:49:26.340,0:49:28.340
I know what is happening in the world now.

0:49:28.340,0:49:36.380
I thank God because it takes a lot of time and sweat for somebody to give such a gift.

0:49:36.380,0:49:41.100
So, I want to thank God because I have seen that this place is God's vineyard.

0:49:41.100,0:49:43.100
So, I thank God for that.

0:49:43.100,0:49:47.400
Having witnessed all these things that God Almighty has done,

0:49:47.400,0:49:51.140
the reconciliation between the families and also the cash gift,

0:49:51.140,0:49:55.160
that was given to the late pastor's family,

0:49:55.160,0:49:58.820
what word of advice do you have for people listening to you,

0:49:58.820,0:50:01.180
most especially the people back in the village?

0:50:01.180,0:50:04.260
What word of advice do you have for them?

0:50:04.260,0:50:08.800
Please, my advice to the people listening to me and the entire world is

0:50:08.800,0:50:12.700
that when anything happens, you have to look before you leap.

0:50:12.700,0:50:14.700
It is very, very important.

0:50:14.700,0:50:16.980
It is not easy for you to accuse somebody.

0:50:16.980,0:50:20.380
Then at the tail end, you discover that that person is not the perpetrator;

0:50:20.380,0:50:22.600
he doesn't have any hand in that case.

0:50:22.600,0:50:24.600
So, I thank God for everything.

0:50:24.600,0:50:28.480
That when anything happens, you have to look before you leap.

0:50:28.480,0:50:30.960
Comfort Anthony Kiddy

0:50:30.960,0:50:37.700
She said she is Comfort Anthony Kiddy from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:50:37.700,0:50:41.480
We want to hear from her what happened today,

0:50:41.480,0:50:44.860
what God has done in her family, most especially in her life.

0:51:24.600,0:51:32.520
She said she is thankful to God Almighty and Prophet T.B. Joshua for the wonderful prophecy

0:51:32.520,0:51:40.060
that was revealed to us, and she is seriously impressed about the gift

0:51:40.060,0:51:48.640
of N500,000 to the family and believes that they will make use of the N500,000 judiciously.

0:51:48.640,0:51:52.040
My name is Bassey Monday Udoh.

0:51:52.040,0:51:55.660
I am from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:51:55.660,0:52:03.520
What happened to me is something incurable because the thing happened unexpectedly.

0:52:03.520,0:52:08.700
I sustained a very serious injury, which I took to many places -

0:52:08.700,0:52:12.500
almost three herbalists - they could not heal my hand.

0:52:12.500,0:52:16.640
I spent a lot of money but they still could not heal my hand.

0:52:16.640,0:52:21.100
But I'm very happy today because the man of God prayed for me and healed me.

0:52:21.100,0:52:24.640
I'm normal now; I can do anything.

0:52:24.640,0:52:30.900
I also thank the man of God for the good thing he has done to help my friend

0:52:30.900,0:52:33.720
to take care of the incident.

0:52:33.720,0:52:36.020
The man of God has done a lot.

0:52:36.020,0:52:38.820
Giving them N500,000 is not an easy thing.

0:52:38.820,0:52:44.380
God bless that man continuously, in Jesus' name.

0:52:44.380,0:52:49.320
So, as the man of God said during the service that they should place you at the prayer line,

0:52:49.320,0:52:51.980
that he will pray for you, he actually prayed for you

0:52:51.980,0:52:55.360
and all this severe pain and problems are gone now.

0:52:55.360,0:52:57.700
Yes, all those things went out from me.

0:52:57.700,0:53:01.280
I feel very fine now.

0:53:01.280,0:53:03.420
We give thanks to God Almighty for what He has done.

0:53:03.420,0:53:06.720
Let us hear from the son of the pastor again.

0:53:06.720,0:53:10.440
This is the N500,000 that the man of God gave me.

0:53:10.440,0:53:14.860
I thank him so much, in Jesus' name.
