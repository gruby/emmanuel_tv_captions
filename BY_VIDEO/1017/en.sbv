There is something that makes me come into Your presence

Thank you.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:13.140,0:02:17.300
The atmosphere is charged now.

0:02:17.300,0:02:23.200
So before we begin to pray, if I may quickly remind you once again:

0:02:23.200,0:02:32.280
We believe 10 million people will have moved to the hospital, to the orphanage home,

0:02:32.280,0:02:38.160
all over the world to the less privileged, to the physically challenged.

0:02:38.160,0:02:40.220
Please move.

0:02:40.220,0:02:43.120
Bless people with your love.

0:02:43.120,0:02:50.880
Bless people with your care, your money, whatever God has given to you - move!

0:02:50.880,0:02:54.220
There are some troubled nations.

0:02:54.220,0:02:59.580
People that have access to go there, you need faith to bless people.

0:02:59.580,0:03:03.600
You can't just go on your own, "Hey, I have millions of dollars".

0:03:03.600,0:03:05.660
You need faith to bless people.

0:03:05.660,0:03:10.900
If that blessing is for God, you are blessing them - through them to God.

0:03:10.900,0:03:13.680
So you have to pay some price.

0:03:13.680,0:03:18.060
Apart from giving, you need grace to do it.

0:03:18.060,0:03:20.880
People are moving all over the world as I'm talking.

0:03:20.880,0:03:24.720
People are moving blessing people, giving a kiss to the old people.

0:03:24.720,0:03:28.780
Give them love and tell them, "Look, Jesus loves you".

0:03:28.780,0:03:34.720
Someone is waiting for you. Tell your neighbor to rescue them.

0:03:34.720,0:03:40.340
Someone is waiting for you, to pay their house rent.

0:03:40.340,0:03:44.380
Someone is waiting for you, for feeding.

0:03:44.380,0:03:48.300
Someone is waiting for you, for good health.

0:03:48.300,0:03:51.940
Someone is waiting for you, for freedom.

0:03:51.940,0:03:54.960
Someone is waiting for you, for blessing.

0:03:54.960,0:03:58.700
Someone is waiting for you, for reconciliation.

0:03:58.700,0:04:01.220
Not just because of my birthday.

0:04:01.220,0:04:05.220
My birthday just brought that awareness.

0:04:05.220,0:04:07.880
It is what you are supposed to be doing.

0:04:07.880,0:04:12.660
That is the life God designed for you because you are an angel -

0:04:12.660,0:04:16.500
angel of God to give love;

0:04:16.500,0:04:19.360
angel of God to give blessing;

0:04:19.360,0:04:22.660
angel to give more healing, deliverance.

0:04:22.660,0:04:24.860
You have not been doing this.

0:04:24.860,0:04:27.140
You have been looking at the face to do.

0:04:27.140,0:04:30.580
"This one hates me, I won´t give. This one loves me, let me give." No!

0:04:30.580,0:04:33.620
If you are an angel of God, you don't look at the face.

0:04:33.620,0:04:36.240
"This one loves me, this one is my family, I will give."

0:04:36.240,0:04:38.740
"This one hates me - no, no, no, I don't want to hear anything."

0:04:38.740,0:04:40.920
"This one is keeping malice. No."

0:04:40.920,0:04:46.660
No!

0:04:46.660,0:04:48.680
Love your neighbor as yourself.

0:04:48.680,0:04:50.740
Your neighbor could be your enemy,

0:04:50.740,0:04:54.220
your neighbor could be those who do not share the same faith with you.

0:04:54.220,0:04:58.560
Love them all.

0:04:58.560,0:05:01.480
Hallelujah!

0:05:01.480,0:05:05.440
Rise up for prayer.

0:05:05.440,0:05:07.840
Right now, open your lips.

0:05:07.840,0:05:10.300
Jesus loves you.

0:05:10.300,0:05:13.560
Open your lips.

0:05:13.560,0:05:20.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:20.740,0:05:25.420
Father, we ask for sanctification.

0:05:25.420,0:05:31.820
Sanctify us, in the name of Jesus.

0:05:31.820,0:05:37.220
Right now, be open. Come out.

0:05:37.220,0:05:39.760
God is not a man.

0:05:39.760,0:05:42.220
Be open.

0:05:42.220,0:05:44.200

0:05:54.340,0:05:58.640
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:05:58.640,0:06:00.580
How do you open?

0:06:00.580,0:06:06.960
To be open is to mean what you are saying.

0:06:06.960,0:06:11.220
Don't just begin to talk. You must mean what you are saying.

0:06:11.220,0:06:16.940
It is time to reconcile.

0:06:16.940,0:06:20.360
What you cannot tell man, tell God.

0:06:20.360,0:06:26.000
Here I am; use me.

0:06:26.000,0:06:29.220
Here I am; send me.

Today, satan is under your foot.

0:07:18.280,0:07:21.340
You know it; I know it.
