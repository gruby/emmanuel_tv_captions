0:00:00.020,0:00:12.900
I want to assure you that wherever you are, Jesus is there.

0:00:12.900,0:00:20.140
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:00:20.140,0:00:26.020
Jesus is going to give us His Word - prayer language

0:00:26.020,0:00:33.540
And whatever word we pronounce now is not just a word - that is the language for you.

0:00:33.540,0:00:35.340
Believe it.

0:00:35.340,0:00:41.920
I'm not going to raise a prayer point, but I'm going to say it according to God's will,

0:00:41.920,0:00:45.520
according to Heaven. So please, be ready.

0:00:45.520,0:00:50.380
Don't think, "You want me to say after you" - No, that is not it.

0:00:50.380,0:00:57.480
This is a word for you to destroy whatever temple that is disturbing you.

0:00:57.480,0:01:00.520
So please, are you ready?

0:01:00.520,0:01:04.480
There's one thing you need to do.

0:01:04.480,0:01:08.600
Have you forgiven those who sinned against you?

0:01:08.600,0:01:11.740
Whether you are right or wrong, you have to forgive.

0:01:11.740,0:01:14.360
Allow your heart to talk about this.

0:01:14.360,0:01:19.140
So you can just conclude here. When you leave from here, you will follow it up.

0:01:19.140,0:01:25.360
If there's anyone somewhere that has wronged you - so painful -

0:01:25.360,0:01:28.500
and you have said you would never forgive.

0:01:28.500,0:01:34.280
In your heart here, take that decision that "Yes, it is over!"

0:01:34.280,0:01:39.880
So when you leave from here, you can follow up the restitution.

0:01:39.880,0:01:45.480
Right now, forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.

0:01:45.480,0:01:49.020
The Bible say, when you stand to pray, forgive.

0:01:49.020,0:01:50.340
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:50.340,0:01:57.360
When you stand to pray, forgive.

0:01:57.360,0:01:58.540
I can't hear you.

0:01:58.540,0:02:00.680
When you stand to pray, forgive.

0:02:00.680,0:02:01.540
Again

0:02:01.540,0:02:04.000
When you stand to pray, forgive.

0:02:04.000,0:02:08.120
You just stand and you want to pray. You just have to forgive.

0:02:08.120,0:02:11.880
Whether you are right or wrong, put it behind you.

0:02:11.880,0:02:16.880
Because you need a free spirit. You don't need to imprison your spirit.

0:02:16.880,0:02:21.020
When you imprison your spirit, it cannot attract God's Spirit.

0:02:21.020,0:02:28.280
To hold offence, whether you are right or wrong, you are imprisoning your spirit.

0:02:28.280,0:02:33.780
Now, it is time to attract God's Spirit.

0:02:33.780,0:02:45.520
I release every spirit that holds offence.

0:02:45.520,0:02:49.640
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:49.640,0:02:53.700
Sometimes you need intervention, you need someone to come in.

0:02:53.700,0:02:56.020
You don´t know that you need someone to help you.

0:02:56.020,0:03:00.320
I release every spirit that holds offence.

0:03:00.320,0:03:07.920
Every spirit that holds offence - be released in the name of Jesus!

0:03:07.920,0:03:13.820
Yes, we are saved with authority.

0:03:13.820,0:03:18.380
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:18.380,0:03:20.920
Sometimes you may not even know.

0:03:20.920,0:03:28.280
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:28.280,0:03:36.560
The dividends of forgiveness is freedom.

0:03:36.560,0:03:40.240
When you forgive, you receive freedom.

0:03:40.240,0:03:42.980
That is just it. I want you to know that.

0:03:42.980,0:03:45.460
The dividends of forgiveness is what?

0:03:45.460,0:03:47.240
Freedom.

0:03:47.240,0:03:49.900
How can you continue caging yourself?

0:03:49.900,0:03:54.440
Whether you are accused or you are accuser,

0:03:54.440,0:03:59.120
for how long will you continue to cage yourself?

0:03:59.120,0:04:10.260
This world is a journey - a marathon.

0:04:10.260,0:04:13.720
You cannot continue caging yourself.

0:04:13.720,0:04:18.200
The Bible says, I will set a table before you in the presence of your what?

0:04:18.200,0:04:19.160
Enemies!

0:04:19.160,0:04:23.440
Eh hen, what else again?

0:04:23.440,0:04:35.640
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:35.640,0:04:45.020
Viewers, wherever you are, we are saying to you -

0:04:45.020,0:05:07.320
the cage of sickness, poverty, isolation is as a result of forgiveness.

0:05:07.320,0:05:11.860
Whether you are the accused or the accuser,

0:05:11.860,0:05:16.700
you find yourself in a cage of poverty,

0:05:16.700,0:05:22.080
you find yourself in a cage of affliction,

0:05:22.080,0:05:24.840
it must be - that is the root.

0:05:24.840,0:05:31.440
The root of poverty is unforgiveness.

0:05:31.440,0:05:36.600
The root of affliction is unforgiveness.

0:05:36.600,0:05:48.540
The root of isolation, depression is unforgiveness.

0:05:48.540,0:05:51.960
Unforgiveness is the root. Tell your neighbour.

0:05:51.960,0:05:57.960
The root of isolation is unforgiveness.

0:05:57.960,0:06:03.200
The root of affliction is unforgiveness.

0:06:03.200,0:06:07.780
The root of depression is unforgiveness.

0:06:07.780,0:06:14.100
The root of poverty is unforgiveness.

0:06:14.100,0:06:20.680
Whether you are the accused or the accuser, that is the root.

0:06:20.680,0:06:23.020
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:06:23.020,0:06:29.640
Viewers, right now, it is time to begin to release yourself.

0:06:29.640,0:06:38.820
You have been in that cage of poverty, isolation, affliction, setback;

0:06:38.820,0:06:43.700
please, forgive whether you are the accused or the accuser.

0:06:43.700,0:06:49.860
Jesus said, "Forgive them, they don´t know what they are doing".

0:06:49.860,0:06:53.140
You are included!

0:06:53.140,0:06:57.980
Begin to forgive. I release your spirit, in the name of Jesus!

0:06:57.980,0:07:08.360
I release your spirit, in the name of Jesus!

0:07:08.360,0:07:13.800
To release your spirit is for you to realise, "Ah, no! What is the gain?"

0:07:13.800,0:07:22.360
Ask yourself, "Ok, this man has wronged me. This woman has wronged me"

0:07:22.360,0:07:25.700
and you now hold that offence.

0:07:25.700,0:07:35.100
For how many years now are you holding that offenve? What is your gain?

0:07:35.100,0:07:40.400
Leave it for God. Don't worry yourself. Tell your neighbour.

0:07:40.400,0:07:44.440
Leave it for God. Don't worry yourself.

0:07:44.440,0:07:47.900
Our life is under repair.

0:07:47.900,0:07:57.760
Something that is under repair which is yearning to be repaired, not destroyed.

0:07:57.760,0:07:58.900
Say, "Mercy!"

0:07:58.900,0:08:00.480
Mercy!

0:08:00.480,0:08:01.540
Say, "Mercy!"

0:08:01.540,0:08:02.680
Mercy!

0:08:02.680,0:08:03.900
Say, "Mercy!"

0:08:03.900,0:08:04.860
Mercy!

0:08:04.860,0:08:05.780
I can´t hear you!

0:08:05.780,0:08:07.060
Mercy!

0:08:07.060,0:08:08.620
Viewers all over the world!

0:08:08.620,0:08:09.540
Mercy!

0:08:09.540,0:08:10.860
Again and again.

0:08:10.860,0:08:11.800
Mercy!

0:08:11.800,0:08:13.000
Again and again.

0:08:13.000,0:08:14.540
Mercy!

0:08:14.540,0:08:17.960
This is what you need now.

0:08:17.960,0:08:25.140
Open your lips now and say, "Have mercy on me, Son of David!"

0:08:25.140,0:08:36.080
Have mercy on me, Son of David!

0:08:36.080,0:08:39.880
You yourself sit down and think about your life.

0:08:39.880,0:08:45.620
Every hope and every belief we had in the past -

0:08:45.620,0:08:52.460
when your children graduate and become a professor, you have everything you need.

0:08:52.460,0:08:56.400
If you become a manager of a company, you have everything you need.

0:08:56.400,0:08:59.500
Look at many homes today.

0:08:59.500,0:09:06.940
See homes, see families, see disunity.

0:09:06.940,0:09:10.420
There's disunity everywhere.

0:09:10.420,0:09:19.660
Mercy!

0:09:19.660,0:09:20.780
I can´t hear you!

0:09:20.780,0:09:21.760
Mercy!

0:09:21.760,0:09:22.860
I can´t hear you!

0:09:22.860,0:09:24.180
Mercy!

0:09:24.180,0:09:27.000
That is it. Who needs mercy?

0:09:27.000,0:09:36.880
That is, holding unforgiveness. You are holding unforgiveness, and you need mercy.

0:09:36.880,0:09:42.640
It is not about your weakness - not about your setback.

0:09:42.640,0:09:53.740
Here I am.

0:09:53.740,0:10:04.920
Right now, open your lips and begin to bind your body, soul, spirit

0:10:04.920,0:10:08.820
to the will and purpose of God for your life.

0:10:08.820,0:10:14.260
Viewers all over the world, be bound, in the name of Jesus -

0:10:14.260,0:10:19.120
to the will and purpose of God, in the name of Jesus!

0:10:19.120,0:10:27.040
Your soul, spirit and body - be bound, in the name of Jesus!

0:10:27.040,0:10:34.100
Every spirit that stands to challenge you,

0:10:34.100,0:10:37.940
that stands to challenge everything about you -

0:10:37.940,0:10:46.480
every spirit that stands to challenge you, that stands to challenge your health -

0:10:46.480,0:10:49.660
begin to rebuke it, in the name of Jesus!

0:10:49.660,0:10:52.420
