The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:09.820,0:00:18.660
Viewers all over the world, thank you for your time.

0:00:18.660,0:00:22.560
TALK ON FAITH

0:00:22.560,0:00:34.180
The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.

0:00:34.180,0:00:39.040
The reality of faith can only be proved by what?

0:00:39.040,0:00:40.580
[By practice.]

0:00:40.580,0:00:46.520
If you say you have faith, you should not just only believe in Him.

0:00:46.520,0:00:53.800
Tell your neighbour, "If you say you have faith, you should not just only believe in Him".

0:00:53.800,0:00:56.880
If somebody says, "I believe God", where is your faith?

0:00:56.880,0:01:05.260
You say, "I believe God, I am a Christian". 
Where is your faith?

0:01:05.260,0:01:10.000
Faith must be practised.

0:01:10.000,0:01:30.760
We should not merely talk about faith; we should put it into practice because faith is a conviction.

0:01:30.760,0:01:32.760
That is faith.

0:01:32.760,0:01:38.760
Our works prove our faith.

0:01:38.760,0:01:44.900
Your work proves your faith.

0:01:44.900,0:01:55.360
Are you doing "419", you know how to play people to gain or to deceive people?

0:01:55.360,0:02:01.040
Your work proves your faith.

0:02:01.040,0:02:05.920
Your work perfects or completes your faith.

0:02:05.920,0:02:11.240
It means if you don’t have good works, you don’t have faith.

0:02:11.240,0:02:17.720
Only faith pleases God.

0:02:17.720,0:02:20.280
Nothing.

0:02:20.280,0:02:24.180
Our works prove our faith.

0:02:24.180,0:02:31.980
Our works perfect or complete our faith.

0:02:31.980,0:02:35.000
Let me start from African countries.

0:02:35.000,0:02:40.520
Sometimes, when I see what is happening around the world, I keep quiet.

0:02:40.520,0:02:44.440
Even the revelation for the year - I refuse to release it.

0:02:44.440,0:02:45.700
I decided to do that.

0:02:45.700,0:02:48.360
I think that position is better.

0:02:48.360,0:02:55.780
That position is better to pray for the whole world.

0:02:55.780,0:03:02.800
The Bible says where there is no vision, people perish.

0:03:02.800,0:03:11.520
What has happened to my people in DRC - Congo.

0:03:11.520,0:03:22.320
I think it was three years ago when I was invited to that country, to see the president.

0:03:22.320,0:03:24.340
I prayed.

0:03:24.340,0:03:30.160
I said - to travel to DRC to see the president, the Head of State...

0:03:30.160,0:03:33.840
I went through the letter and said, "OK, I must go".

0:03:33.840,0:03:35.820
I prayed over it.

0:03:35.820,0:03:40.500
God said that He would give me a message to deliver.

0:03:40.500,0:03:43.600
"If you say you are going, do you have a message to deliver now?"

0:03:43.600,0:03:44.540
I said, "No".

0:03:44.540,0:03:48.440
"So, you have to wait for the message."

0:03:48.440,0:03:50.480
I said, "OK".

0:03:50.480,0:03:54.000
It is true - I am not going there to pray.

0:03:54.000,0:03:56.940
I should go there to deliver a message.

0:03:56.940,0:04:03.960
If I say that I will travel there because I am a man of God and I am going to pray...

0:04:03.960,0:04:08.880
After a prayer, there must be a revelation but for now - no revelation.

0:04:08.880,0:04:11.940
That was three years ago.

0:04:11.940,0:04:13.440
I said, "OK".

0:04:13.440,0:04:17.040
I then decided to send my team.

0:04:17.040,0:04:25.820
I raised a team of three, four, five from different countries to visit the nation and the president.

0:04:25.820,0:04:29.560
I asked them to greet the president.

0:04:29.560,0:04:31.820
I was not trying to be proud.

0:04:31.820,0:04:40.200
Who I am - I am just a human being but as a man of God, I must have a revelation before I move.

0:04:40.200,0:04:46.880
I just wanted to honour the invitation because I was not able to go there.

0:04:46.880,0:04:51.620
OK, my people went there - good.

0:04:51.620,0:05:04.400
They received them joyfully as visitors to the Head of State.

0:05:04.400,0:05:07.900
They delivered my message and came back.

0:05:07.900,0:05:18.260
The delegation from this country also came here with joy to visit us - OK.

0:05:18.260,0:05:26.300
I said, "Before God will release me to come to your country, this is the message:

0:05:26.300,0:05:30.620
By February, there will be trouble".

0:05:30.620,0:05:33.060
That was three years ago.

0:05:33.060,0:05:45.840
I said the trouble would start from February and I stated those troubles that would start,

0:05:45.840,0:05:52.040
which they took home and delivered to the nation.

0:05:52.040,0:05:53.760
The reason I am saying this is that

0:05:53.760,0:06:03.480
I am worried; I am not comfortable because of what is happening around the world.

0:06:03.480,0:06:08.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:08.680,0:06:16.880
This will happen; that will happen, by February.

0:06:16.880,0:06:24.780
The whole thing will start unfolding and there will be a crisis.

0:06:24.780,0:06:26.940
Let's start our prayer from the country.

0:06:26.940,0:06:35.300
Rise up and let us pray for the nation because the crisis is coming.

0:06:35.300,0:06:38.160
I want you to do it with all your heart.

0:06:38.160,0:06:41.860
Don't say it is not your country - any country is your country.

0:06:41.860,0:06:48.760
Open your heart and pray for God's intervention in the nation, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Prayer For God's Intervention In The Nation Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

0:07:03.340,0:07:11.980
God's intervention – because I am seeing trouble coming – big trouble.

0:07:11.980,0:07:15.040
God's intervention.

0:07:15.040,0:07:34.980
Prayer For God's Intervention In The Nation Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

0:07:34.980,0:07:44.460
God's intervention in the nation, Congo - DRC.

Prayer For God's Intervention In The Nation Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

0:07:48.620,0:07:51.720
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:07:51.720,0:07:53.480
[Amen.]

0:07:53.480,0:07:58.000
I am saying this because with what is happening now,

0:07:58.000,0:08:04.620
what I saw in the vision today again, my heart is bleeding.

0:08:04.620,0:08:10.280
I know, with God, all things are possible.

0:08:10.280,0:08:16.040
God will redeem the nation and citizens in Jesus' name.

0:08:16.040,0:08:17.580
[Amen.]

0:08:17.580,0:08:18.880
You may be seated.

0:08:18.880,0:08:24.180
You will join me to pray for many countries today.

0:08:24.180,0:08:30.000
Let's now go to Southern Africa.

0:08:30.000,0:08:45.480
I am seeing some natural disasters like wind – bad wind coming from the sea -

0:08:45.480,0:08:58.080
bad nature – natural disasters that will destroy many things, that will move from one country to another.

0:08:58.080,0:09:03.660
I saw this – that was the last two years.

0:09:03.660,0:09:11.320
We keep praying but there is a momentum in the sea which will look strange,

0:09:11.320,0:09:14.140
which has never happened in Africa.

0:09:14.140,0:09:18.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:18.540,0:09:25.420
The whole thing will arrange from the Mozambique area.

0:09:25.420,0:09:28.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:28.920,0:09:33.640
Poor people live in environments where all these things will happen -

0:09:33.640,0:09:39.320
people who will not have a place to go; they will become refugees.

0:09:39.320,0:09:42.920
Poor people who are looking for shelter to stay -

0:09:42.920,0:09:48.760
they are the ones living in ninety percent of the environment I am talking about.

0:09:48.760,0:09:53.500
This thing will move from country to country.

0:09:53.500,0:09:55.880
I don't want to mention any county.

0:09:55.880,0:10:02.860
Let us rise up and pray for part of Southern Africa -

0:10:02.860,0:10:12.360
moving from countries like Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana and some areas there.

0:10:12.360,0:10:15.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:15.780,0:10:18.700
Why am I calling for your attention to this?

0:10:18.700,0:10:20.440
I have been praying.

0:10:20.440,0:10:23.800
God said, "Call the attention of your people".

0:10:23.800,0:10:30.300
Let's pray together because of the Hosts of Heaven, the atmosphere we are in.

0:10:30.300,0:10:34.740
Whatever we loose shall be loosed, whatever we bind shall be bound.

0:10:34.740,0:10:37.020
Open your lips for prayer.

0:10:37.020,0:11:09.940
Prayer For God's Intervention In Countries of Southern Africa

0:11:09.940,0:11:13.900

0:11:13.900,0:11:15.200
[Amen.]

0:11:15.200,0:11:17.200
Let there be calmness!

0:11:17.200,0:11:18.760
[Amen.]

0:11:18.760,0:11:29.540
Wherever this nature – tragedy in the sea, air, rainy season, dry season -

0:11:29.540,0:11:37.520
this bad nature that is coming – let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!

0:11:37.520,0:11:40.880
[Amen.]

0:11:40.880,0:11:45.960
Jesus said to the sea and wind, "Be calm!"

0:11:45.960,0:11:48.380
Let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!

0:11:48.380,0:11:51.120
[Amen.]

0:11:51.120,0:12:05.840
What Africa depends on at this time is farming and it will greatly affect the farmers,

0:12:05.840,0:12:13.160
cattle rearers – all these will be affected, greatly.

0:12:13.160,0:12:15.740
Let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!

0:12:15.740,0:12:17.740
[Amen.]

0:12:21.000,0:12:29.300
As you are praying, add Ethiopia as a nation.

0:12:29.300,0:12:35.860
Remember the nation Ethiopia in prayer.

0:12:35.860,0:12:41.080
Pray against famine – serious one.

0:12:41.080,0:12:46.540
What is the cause of this? Because of season – unpredictable.

0:12:46.540,0:12:50.460
Open your lips and pray for the country Ethiopia.

0:12:50.460,0:13:19.860
Prayer For God's Intervention In The Country Ethiopia

0:13:19.860,0:13:21.800
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:13:21.800,0:13:22.860
[Amen.]

0:13:22.860,0:13:29.540
Open your lips and pray with me: You, wind, we say, be calm!

0:13:29.540,0:13:34.600
Let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!

0:13:34.600,0:13:47.800
You, wind, you, disaster of any kind – be calm, in the name of Jesus!

0:13:47.800,0:13:53.520
We cannot let this thing to disturb us - they will have to go back the way they came.

0:13:53.520,0:14:08.720
We say, calmness, in the name of Jesus!

0:14:08.720,0:14:14.560
Anytime you pray, please remember this country.

0:14:14.560,0:14:26.080
It is not that other countries don't have their own challenges but I'm seeing this natural disaster.

0:14:26.080,0:14:28.380
You may be seated.

0:14:28.380,0:14:33.280
Now, back to my nation, Nigeria.

0:14:33.280,0:14:45.460
The last two years, there was a vision, a prophecy for the nation, which is still going on.

0:14:45.460,0:14:49.360
It's not only for last year but still for this year.

0:14:49.360,0:14:53.060
It is still going on 'til June.

0:14:53.060,0:15:00.200
This is why God said, "Hold on. What you said two years ago that there will be scarcity of food

0:15:00.200,0:15:09.020
and devaluation of money and we are in the valley – that was two years ago -

0:15:09.020,0:15:17.280
and our future is crying for help, will end this coming June".

0:15:17.280,0:15:19.260
We are in February now.

0:15:19.260,0:15:25.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:25.480,0:15:32.040
By the time we leave June, we know all those prophecies I said about food scarcity, devaluation of money...

0:15:32.040,0:15:44.780
Because this money will still continue going up and it will seem to rest when it is getting to 650.

0:15:44.780,0:15:52.220
It will seem to begin to rest; it will not be able to go forward.

0:15:52.220,0:16:00.360
It will not be able to go forward because that will be the peak.

0:16:00.360,0:16:07.260
The battle of going up, down, up, down will continue but when it gets to that,

0:16:07.260,0:16:15.760
it will not be able to go up again; rather, it will want to go down, if the system permits -

0:16:15.760,0:16:22.580
if the system agrees with divine will.

0:16:22.580,0:16:28.720
I was saying something which you didn't take note of and I want to repeat that.

0:16:28.720,0:16:33.640
Your president has good intentions.

0:16:33.640,0:16:35.780
I repeat again.

0:16:35.780,0:16:38.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:38.900,0:16:47.180
Good intentions cannot be carried out alone without good followers.

0:16:50.840,0:16:54.020
If you heard what I said - it is OK.

0:16:54.020,0:17:03.260
But even Mr. T.B. Joshua may have heard what Prophet T.B. Joshua was saying as a human being.

0:17:03.260,0:17:06.820
Two persons are standing here.

0:17:06.820,0:17:11.820
Mr. T.B. Joshua may hate Prophet for what he is saying.

0:17:11.820,0:17:20.640
If Mr. hates the Prophet - if you hate me, there is nothing bad about that.

0:17:20.640,0:17:22.800
I repeat again.

0:17:22.800,0:17:36.040
Your president has good intentions but good intentions cannot be carried out alone without good followers.

Ask God to give him whatever he needs.

0:18:41.160,0:18:49.180
Because you have not heard anything, whatever you believe he needs

0:18:49.180,0:18:59.640
for the strength and enablement to rule successfully, the Lord should give him. Prayer.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:20.400,0:21:31.280
Africa as a whole - we only look for leaders, we don't look for institutions.

0:21:31.280,0:21:35.780
We don't mind about institutions, we are looking for leaders.

0:21:35.780,0:21:40.400
Leaders cannot rule alone, without good institutions.

0:21:40.400,0:21:43.120
The whole Africa lacks institutions.

0:21:43.120,0:21:47.660
They have leaders but leaders cannot do it alone.

0:21:47.660,0:21:54.360
It is like a prophet without disciples.

0:21:54.360,0:21:58.920
It is not a "one day job" for a prophet to have disciples.

0:21:58.920,0:22:03.420
This is why everywhere in Africa they want to run for power two times.

0:22:03.420,0:22:09.360
Their first time seems to be rubbish because they use strangers to work with them.

0:22:09.360,0:22:14.620
By the second time they would have studied those who can work with them and do good.

0:22:14.620,0:22:21.900
Every African leader does better the second time because they didn't have good disciples

0:22:21.900,0:22:25.800
to work with them during the "first time".

0:22:25.800,0:22:29.200
People working with leaders during the "first time" are donors -

0:22:29.200,0:22:32.760
they support them, give leaders money, pray for them

0:22:32.760,0:22:39.160
but they are not real disciples - they just give help, financial and moral support.

0:22:39.160,0:22:44.480
By the time the leader becomes a president, he calls his supporters to give them positions.

0:22:44.480,0:22:48.200
But the leaders don't really know them by their character.

0:22:48.200,0:22:51.200
They receive positions just because they helped.

0:22:51.200,0:22:58.520
So, the "first time" is always nonsense in every African country

0:22:58.520,0:23:04.760
because they seem to use strangers to work with them.

0:23:04.760,0:23:10.760
In the "second time", they would have studied people and know, "Oh, really! This is my disciple"

0:23:10.760,0:23:18.080
and put them into positions. They do better during their "second time".

0:23:18.080,0:23:24.980
I'm not studying government - I'm just telling you the mind of God.

0:23:24.980,0:23:30.980
If any leader comes to the office for the first time and says that he would do everything,

0:23:30.980,0:23:33.100
he would do this, he would do that,

0:23:33.100,0:23:36.920
I just look - "Can you do it alone?"

0:23:36.920,0:23:42.260
You are coming for the first time - for how long have you known the people working with you?

0:23:42.260,0:23:45.080
Do you know them by their relationships and character?

0:23:45.080,0:23:48.240
How do you know that these people will be loyal to you?

0:23:48.240,0:23:51.000
Just because they helped you...

0:23:51.000,0:23:54.520
If you give money to someone, it does not mean that he is your friend.

0:23:54.520,0:23:57.700
You can give money to your enemy.

0:23:57.700,0:24:01.220
You can even help your enemy.

0:24:01.220,0:24:06.100
It does not mean that he is a man of your own heart.

0:24:06.100,0:24:13.680
That you give millions, trillions to someone does not mean that he is your friend.

0:24:13.680,0:24:20.300
It does not mean that he is a man of your own heart.

0:24:20.300,0:24:25.560
Those are the challenges African countries are facing today.

0:24:25.560,0:24:30.460
When Africa begins to think about institutions...

0:24:30.460,0:24:39.220
There should be a school or university for leaders to go to before they can become this or that.

0:24:39.220,0:24:46.660
So, anyone who becomes a president of a nation must have his disciples as well to join him to rule.

0:24:46.660,0:24:51.180
If not, whatever he promises will fail.

0:24:51.180,0:24:57.700
This is why the "second time" of any leader in Africa seems to do better.

0:24:57.700,0:25:03.480
By the "second time", they would have chosen better people they can work with.

0:25:03.480,0:25:06.700
They will look for men of their own heart.

0:25:06.700,0:25:09.680
This is what is happening all over Africa.

0:25:09.680,0:25:13.000
Now, the same thing is going on all over the world.

0:25:13.000,0:25:17.260
Not only in Africa but all over the world.

0:25:17.260,0:25:21.140
People don't look for a man of their own heart to work with them;

0:25:21.140,0:25:27.460
they just call people because they donate millions to support them.

0:25:27.460,0:25:33.780
They support them in their campaigns.

0:25:33.780,0:25:35.240
They work harder.

0:25:35.240,0:25:41.840
They call them to their cabinet to work - it does not mean that this man can be a man of your own heart.

0:25:41.840,0:25:44.820
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:25:44.820,0:25:48.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:48.640,0:25:53.280
Take note of these words I said just now.

0:25:53.280,0:26:02.460
Leaders seem to use men who are not of their own heart.

0:26:02.460,0:26:14.900
To have a man of your own heart is not a day's job; it's a matter of time and preparation.

0:26:14.900,0:26:19.780
To be a minister of this or that...

0:26:19.780,0:26:22.400
To be a chairman of this or that...

0:26:22.400,0:26:27.080
... and you being the head, and he will be loyal to you.

0:26:27.080,0:26:36.260
Your vision will be his vision - it is not easy - it takes time and preparation.

0:26:36.260,0:26:45.080
Jesus knew he would not be able to succeed alone; that is why He had 12 disciples.

0:26:45.080,0:26:49.800
He knew no one can go it alone.

0:26:49.800,0:26:57.000
He knew that as a Saviour he had to look for people to follow Him.

0:26:57.000,0:27:00.180
Even among them - you know what happened.

0:27:00.180,0:27:05.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:05.120,0:27:11.940
You know what is happening all over the world - not only in politics; even in the house of God.

0:27:11.940,0:27:16.700
The cause of churches collapsing is what I am talking about now.

0:27:16.700,0:27:27.740
They cannot point to a man of their own heart to do this for them and they cannot do it alone.

0:27:27.740,0:27:39.400
Instead, they use their enemies to do this and their enemies crumble their vision.

0:27:39.400,0:27:44.580
You know what is happening to your business; you cannot do it alone.

0:27:44.580,0:27:50.520
At a time, you wanted to expand but no one was there to help you.

0:27:50.520,0:27:53.580
You cannot be in two places at the same time.

0:27:53.580,0:27:55.840
You continue to expand where you are.

0:27:55.840,0:28:08.960
When you begin to be too popular in a certain place, attack and persecution start.

0:28:08.960,0:28:13.720
This is why today you see millionaires who were up there crumble

0:28:13.720,0:28:17.920
because they could not find people to carry out their vision.

0:28:17.920,0:28:30.160
Branches of their companies – the people that represented those branches crumbled their vision.

0:28:30.160,0:28:40.580
When you start to think about expanding - "No, let me remain where I am".

0:28:40.580,0:28:46.680
Success does not permit that; success wants to explode.

0:28:46.680,0:28:50.820
You can’t light a candle and put it under the roof.

0:28:50.820,0:28:54.140
You must bring the candle out and let the world see it.

0:28:54.140,0:28:57.740
If you put a candle under the roof, it will burn the house.

0:28:57.740,0:29:04.340
If you say you are afraid and you camp that success, you will explode with the success.

0:29:04.340,0:29:07.740
The success will consume you.

0:29:07.740,0:29:13.060
So, now, what is the way out?

0:29:13.060,0:29:23.320
Faith is something that comes spontaneously, naturally – that is faith.

0:29:23.320,0:29:25.380
What is the way out?

0:29:25.380,0:29:34.500
The way out is . as you are growing, take time to train people and impart to people.

0:29:34.500,0:29:39.860
If not, by the time you finish growing and become an iroko tree,

0:29:39.860,0:29:49.040
you will not see anyone to help you; you will use your enemy as a helper.

0:29:49.040,0:29:53.900
Jesus took time to train people, to impart in them.

0:29:53.900,0:29:57.540
And even then - He was betrayed.

0:29:57.540,0:30:05.920
But at last, He made the best out of His people.

0:30:05.920,0:30:10.260
Take your time to train people.

0:30:10.260,0:30:12.380
What do I mean by training?

0:30:12.380,0:30:15.320
Allow them to see what you are doing.

0:30:15.320,0:30:18.900
Let them see what you are doing, so they can do the same.

0:30:18.900,0:30:24.280
As they see what you are doing, your enemies among them will give way

0:30:24.280,0:30:28.460
and those men after your own heart will continue to follow you.

0:30:28.460,0:30:34.500
Finally when you get there, they can be there to carry the vision.

0:30:34.500,0:30:39.220
This is what the world is facing today; there is crisis in this world.

0:30:39.220,0:30:41.160
That is why there are no new things coming.

0:30:41.160,0:30:45.000
I told you last time that we are running out of ideas.

0:30:45.000,0:30:48.700
The world is running out of ideas.

0:30:48.700,0:30:51.620
There is no new vision - nothing new.

0:30:51.620,0:30:55.900
Science is running out of ideas.

0:30:55.900,0:31:00.340
There is no new idea because they are dying with their own ideas.

0:31:00.340,0:31:03.280
They cannot impart those ideas to people.

0:31:03.280,0:31:07.220
They don't have people of their own heart to work with them.

0:31:07.220,0:31:10.160
If you continue to carry it alone, you will get tired.

0:31:10.160,0:31:13.880
If this body is tired, you cannot carry out the vision again.

0:31:13.880,0:31:18.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:18.400,0:31:36.940
So, like I have said; as you are growing, take your time to grow others.

0:31:36.940,0:31:42.240
It's not just to be using them and then giving them money.

0:31:42.240,0:31:43.660
We are not talking about money.

0:31:43.660,0:31:47.760
You have people working with you - you can pay them a lot of money - that is not the issue.

0:31:47.760,0:31:53.020
Money cannot make the vision we are talking about; it's all about sincerity.

0:31:53.020,0:31:58.640
You say, "I pay them. I give them huge money. They work with me..."

0:31:58.640,0:32:02.120
We are not talking of working with you and giving them money.

0:32:02.120,0:32:05.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:05.620,0:32:17.880
OK, if you are bigger than this tomorrow, how will you maintain that grace?

0:32:17.880,0:32:24.760
You alone cannot maintain that position; you need someone to…

0:32:24.760,0:32:31.160
And you don’t have any men of your own heart;

0:32:31.160,0:32:38.860
you finally find yourself using your enemy to maintain your vision.

0:32:38.860,0:32:44.620
Look at universities all over the world or in Nigeria... just university in Nigeria alone.

0:32:44.620,0:32:45.820
Do you know what is happening?

0:32:45.820,0:32:50.720
Those best universities in the world that we know about in Nigeria.

0:32:50.720,0:32:55.280
When you go to their premises or campus, see what is happening...

0:32:55.280,0:32:57.060
It is not an issue of money.

0:32:57.060,0:33:00.800
But we keep shouting, "Money! There is no money to develop".

0:33:00.800,0:33:03.300
It is not an issue of money!

0:33:03.300,0:33:06.180
I know money is very important.

0:33:06.180,0:33:08.520
It is not an issue of money.

0:33:08.520,0:33:18.840
If you look at first class students - very brilliant - and you send them to another country for a program

0:33:18.840,0:33:22.620
and another country sends their first class students to that country...

0:33:22.620,0:33:30.120
When they come back, they will raise the standard here.

0:33:30.120,0:33:33.800
How much does it take to send people to...

0:33:33.800,0:33:35.260
And you keep saying, "Money money money".

0:33:35.260,0:33:43.140
If there is money and no brain, can money work?

0:33:43.140,0:33:45.740
Brain is dying - we are running out of ideas.

0:33:45.740,0:33:46.880
You talk of money.

0:33:46.880,0:33:56.340
When there is no idea, money is dead; money is useless.

0:33:56.340,0:34:05.800
If a man without an idea has money - it is like "mental people" having money - the crazy man.

0:34:05.800,0:34:14.940
It is like a very rich man suddenly having a mental problem - it is equal to a rich man running out of ideas.

0:34:14.940,0:34:17.720
When you don't have ideas, the money is useless.

0:34:17.720,0:34:22.900
It is an idea that makes use of money; it is an idea that spends money.

0:34:22.900,0:34:24.400
Where are we going?

0:34:24.400,0:34:25.880
That is our education.

0:34:25.880,0:34:34.120
Not only in Nigeria - all over the world - just like that.

0:34:34.120,0:34:41.840
There are some faculties at universities which need to be increased in number.

0:34:41.840,0:34:45.120
But because you are looking for money, you just want to have a university

0:34:45.120,0:34:50.860
and you don't mind any course they study. You need money from students.

0:34:50.860,0:34:57.600
Whereas there are some important faculties that can build the nation.

0:34:57.600,0:35:00.360
Until we begin to separate those faculties...

0:35:00.360,0:35:06.700
You have this university, college of medicine; you have this university, law school...

0:35:06.700,0:35:12.640
No. You bring all together which destroys university.

0:35:12.640,0:35:18.580
There are some students there that "have no brain" - they just go to university to study any course.

0:35:18.580,0:35:22.580
Compare it to a subject where you have to have a brain to study it.

0:35:22.580,0:35:31.740
You must separate these students in order to build the nation.

0:35:31.740,0:35:35.120
But the university of this or college...

0:35:35.120,0:35:38.620
When you look at those faculties, they seem to be useless.

0:35:38.620,0:35:42.180
These are the faculties that you only spend money on.

0:35:42.180,0:35:47.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:47.920,0:35:52.500
When you look at the nation, you will be able to know what the nation needs at that time.

0:35:52.500,0:35:58.120
What does this nation, your country, need at this time?

0:35:58.120,0:36:10.300
Not until we begin to sort out those faculties, universities - separate them, put them where they belong.

0:36:10.300,0:36:12.920
The importance of those faculties...

0:36:12.920,0:36:17.260
Know how you can get the money to raise the standard of those faculties to build the nation.

0:36:17.260,0:36:21.280
When you build those faculties, you are building the nation.

0:36:21.280,0:36:24.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:24.860,0:36:28.400
Many parents don't know their right and left.

0:36:28.400,0:36:31.520
They just want their children to go to university.

0:36:31.520,0:36:32.980
Fine.

0:36:32.980,0:36:40.280
We get money but money without ideas is useless.

0:36:40.280,0:36:48.820
So, I think - what we are facing today is that we lack ideas.

0:36:48.820,0:36:52.860
People lack ideas but have money.

0:36:52.860,0:36:54.300
You can't eat your money.

0:36:54.300,0:36:59.680
Your money is not valuable without ideas.

0:36:59.680,0:37:06.220
When you ask people a simple question today, they will complain about their government.

0:37:06.220,0:37:09.320
Our government doesn't do this or that.

0:37:09.320,0:37:14.140
When you don't run out of ideas, you do not have any business with the government -

0:37:14.140,0:37:21.340
even the government will want you to help the nation if you have not run out of ideas.

0:37:21.340,0:37:24.560
It is when we run out of ideas that we begin to complain about the government.

0:37:24.560,0:37:32.320
No money to do this or that - because we are running out of ideas.

0:37:32.320,0:37:35.940
You can be so great without the government.

0:37:35.940,0:37:39.620
The government will now turn to you for help.

0:37:39.620,0:37:43.900
There is a lot of burden on the government because everybody depends on the government.

0:37:43.900,0:37:47.140
That is why the world is collapsing.

0:37:47.140,0:37:52.220
You depend on the government of your nation to live, which is wrong.

0:37:52.220,0:37:55.740
Because we are running out of ideas.

0:37:55.740,0:38:00.480
Without a contract from the government, you cannot live.

0:38:00.480,0:38:03.700
Without government supporting business, you cannot live.

0:38:03.700,0:38:09.940
If there is no budget to give money to everybody, you complain.

0:38:09.940,0:38:13.800
This is what we depend on because we are running out of ideas.

0:38:13.800,0:38:19.820
Not until people have ideas, you cannot leave this pitiful life.

0:38:19.820,0:38:26.360
When trouble comes to the government, it will affect you.

0:38:26.360,0:38:30.300
You have to look beyond.

0:38:30.300,0:38:32.160
Yes.

0:38:32.160,0:38:34.740
Rise up for prayer.

0:38:34.740,0:38:39.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:38:39.580,0:38:50.840
What is the cause of man running out of ideas?

0:38:50.840,0:38:58.000
When you run out of ideas, you begin to look at others to reason and think,

0:38:58.000,0:39:06.420
compare yourself to others and measure yourself with others, you are running out of ideas.

0:39:06.420,0:39:12.940
You say, "This man is slim - I want to be slim. Look at the hair of this woman - I want the same haircut.

0:39:12.940,0:39:17.800
I saw a posh car last week - I want to buy the same car".

0:39:17.800,0:39:20.120
You are running out of ideas.

0:39:20.120,0:39:30.940
You begin to imitate others to live, talk and even pray.

0:39:30.940,0:39:38.720
You look at what people say - you want to say the same because you run out of ideas.

0:39:38.720,0:39:42.800
When you run out of ideas, your money is not your money;

0:39:42.800,0:39:47.580
your money is someone else's money.

0:39:47.580,0:39:49.580
Are you with me?

0:39:49.580,0:39:54.900
When you run out of ideas, your possession is not your possession;

0:39:54.900,0:39:59.120
it is someone else's possession because you don’t know the use of it.

0:39:59.120,0:40:03.360
Someone else will be using your possessions, enjoying what you have.

0:40:03.360,0:40:08.300
You go for a medical check-up - little time - sickness, disease, this, that...

0:40:08.300,0:40:10.900
They give you this; they give you chieftaincy.

0:40:10.900,0:40:15.560
When there is no money, you are not given the chieftaincy. When money comes, they call you for chieftaincies.

0:40:15.560,0:40:22.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:22.680,0:40:27.900
Time to ask yourself, "Why did they not call me for chieftaincy when I didn't have money?

0:40:27.900,0:40:30.280
But now I have money and they call me for chieftaincy".

0:40:30.280,0:40:33.020
You should know that something is wrong somewhere.

0:40:33.020,0:40:36.260
"I was not sick when I did not have enough.

0:40:36.260,0:40:38.620
But now that I have enough, I'm sick."

0:40:38.620,0:40:40.880
What do you think happened then?

0:40:40.880,0:40:45.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:45.400,0:40:53.980
"People call me to invite me, to visit them, to come to a party, from all over the world, because I have...

0:40:53.980,0:40:56.200
How do they know that I have?

0:40:56.200,0:41:00.900
When I didn't have, nobody invited me, nobody wanted to be my friend."

0:41:00.900,0:41:03.180
Can't you ask yourself, "Why?"

0:41:03.180,0:41:07.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:41:07.880,0:41:14.640
So much responsibility - and this responsibility will take you away from God.

0:41:14.640,0:41:16.460
Take note of this once again.

0:41:16.460,0:41:26.460
When you run out of ideas, your possession is someone else's possession.

0:41:26.460,0:41:35.040
To run out of ideas means when you cannot think right at the right time or do things at the right time.

0:41:35.040,0:41:41.340
You may do them but not at the right time.

0:41:41.340,0:41:45.580
You move - it is right that you must move but it is at the wrong time.

0:41:45.580,0:41:50.080
To do things at the right time gives result.

0:41:50.080,0:41:53.180
There is a time for everything.

0:41:53.180,0:41:59.620
If you are not standing up for prayer now at the right time, it means God will not connect with us.

0:41:59.620,0:42:01.320
You pray at the wrong time.

0:42:01.320,0:42:06.160
It's right you are praying but are you praying at the right time?

0:42:06.160,0:42:11.440
The Holy Spirit intercedes for us; we don’t know how to pray.

0:42:11.440,0:42:14.900
You cannot just stand up and just say, "I want to pray".

0:42:14.900,0:42:20.300
If I have faith in God, there will be what?

0:42:20.300,0:42:25.140
There will be work that corresponds with the faith.

0:42:25.140,0:42:36.420
Tell your neighbour, "If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith".

0:42:36.420,0:42:37.200
Again.

0:42:37.200,0:42:41.720
If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.

0:42:41.720,0:42:42.780
I cannot hear you.

0:42:42.780,0:42:48.000
If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.

0:42:48.000,0:42:50.460
If there is no work that corresponds with the faith...

0:42:50.460,0:42:56.140
If work is different from faith - that is, you have bad work.

0:42:56.140,0:43:01.100
The work you are doing is not good.

0:43:01.100,0:43:05.060
But you have faith - that cannot correspond.

0:43:05.060,0:43:13.040
If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.

0:43:13.040,0:43:15.880
It is like a magnet and a nail.

0:43:15.880,0:43:22.320
You have a nail here and you have a magnet here - if you bring them close, they will...

0:43:22.320,0:43:25.480
You can see - magnet.

0:43:25.480,0:43:30.080
But if it is not a nail, it will not...

0:43:30.080,0:43:37.840
If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.

0:43:37.840,0:43:46.900
If not, you will continue to say, "I am a Christian. I have faith" but this work doesn't correspond with...

0:43:46.900,0:43:49.900
This is why when we pray today, our prayer goes nowhere.

0:43:49.900,0:43:51.760
We talk to ourselves when we are praying.

0:43:51.760,0:43:56.740
"In the name of Jesus" - you are talking to yourself.

0:43:56.740,0:43:57.660
Tell your neighbour again:

0:43:57.660,0:44:12.600
"If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith."

0:44:12.600,0:44:18.060
This is what I mean by our work proves our faith.

0:44:18.060,0:44:24.260
This is what I mean by our work completes or perfects our faith.

0:44:24.260,0:44:28.200
If your work does not correspond with your faith, you are faithless.

0:44:28.200,0:44:31.520
The faith you are talking about is not faith in God.

0:44:31.520,0:44:41.880
There are all kinds of faith but I am talking about faith in God.

0:44:41.880,0:44:52.080
Have faith in God
All things are possible

0:44:52.080,0:44:53.320
Again.

0:44:53.320,0:45:06.840
Have faith in God
All things are possible

0:45:06.840,0:45:08.180
Again.

0:45:08.180,0:45:23.780
Have faith in God
All things are possible

0:45:23.780,0:45:25.660
That is the faith I'm talking about.

0:45:25.660,0:45:29.340
Have it in God - the Bible talks about it in Mark.

0:45:29.340,0:45:47.480
If there is faith - if you claim you have this faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.

0:45:47.480,0:45:52.520
You know where your problem comes from now.

0:45:52.520,0:45:56.560
You can know where your problem comes from.

0:45:56.560,0:46:06.000
Right now, it's a matter of talking with all your heart, confessing with all your heart.

0:46:06.000,0:46:14.460
Ask God for His grace; you need His grace.

0:46:14.460,0:46:16.700
Open your lips - prayer.

0:46:16.700,0:46:31.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:31.420,0:46:42.480
Ask God for His grace.

0:46:42.480,0:46:53.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:53.940,0:46:57.420
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.

0:46:57.420,0:46:59.540
[Amen.]

0:46:59.540,0:47:05.700
Out of the message I gave you today, take note of one point.

0:47:05.700,0:47:08.920
This is the mistake we are doing.

0:47:08.920,0:47:15.800
You never believed that your enemy can give you trillions of dollars and yet be your enemy.

0:47:15.800,0:47:23.360
You believed that someone giving you a billion dollars loves you with all his heart.

0:47:23.360,0:47:31.420
Your enemy can give you trillions of dollars and yet be your enemy.

0:47:31.420,0:47:33.360
But you don't know that.

0:47:33.360,0:47:44.880
To you; you consider someone giving you so much a man of your own heart - no, my brother!

0:47:44.880,0:47:47.540
How do you run your business then?

0:47:47.540,0:47:52.040
You run it without ideas because you need money.

0:47:52.040,0:47:56.220
Somebody giving you money becomes your dear friend.

0:47:56.220,0:48:03.280
We don't go beyond to ask God, "Who is giving me money?"

0:48:03.280,0:48:08.140
Do you know that your enemy can establish you?

0:48:08.140,0:48:15.060
If you know that raise up your hand.

0:48:15.060,0:48:25.900
An enemy can establish you for reasons known to him.

0:48:25.900,0:48:29.680
Oh my God.

0:48:29.680,0:48:34.140
There are many things that you don't know.

0:48:34.140,0:48:37.880
You don't know because you are a business man.

0:48:37.880,0:48:40.480
You are a politician.

0:48:40.480,0:48:45.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:48:45.440,0:48:50.720
This is the reason why you are facing many things.

0:48:50.720,0:48:55.800
Think about your track record from the beginning.

0:48:55.800,0:48:58.420
Sit down and think about your life.

0:48:58.420,0:49:04.160
You will begin to agree with me.

0:49:04.160,0:49:11.580
You don't believe that people that have done so much for you can turn round to be your enemies.

0:49:11.580,0:49:17.580
They seem to be giving you so much, they seem to establish you - they later turn to be your enemies

0:49:17.580,0:49:21.860
at a difficult time, at the time you need them.

0:49:21.860,0:49:35.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:49:35.980,0:49:42.740
I don't want you to get to Heaven before you understand all this.

0:49:42.740,0:49:47.480
I don't want you to go to Heaven before you see the file.

0:49:47.480,0:49:53.020
"I didn't know that this thing is happening in this world and I was there for many years - see me."

0:49:53.020,0:50:02.720
I don't want you to get to Heaven before you understand this; you better understand it now.
