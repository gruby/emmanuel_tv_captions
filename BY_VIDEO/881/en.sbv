0:00:00.740,0:00:03.580
Africa!

0:00:03.580,0:00:08.100
Tell you neighbour: Africa!

0:00:08.100,0:00:12.640
You don't regard and you don't respect your own.

0:00:12.640,0:00:16.440
I said, you don't regard and you don't respect your own.

0:00:16.440,0:00:23.540
I'm writing a book: "Africa, stop begging outside Africa".

0:00:23.540,0:00:26.580
We are beggars!

0:00:26.580,0:00:32.580
You never believe that you can go outside the country and bless them with the little you have

0:00:32.580,0:00:38.880
but you want to collect from them; this is why we are what we are - beggars.

0:00:38.880,0:00:45.780
I want to share with you one of my big secrets: All these crusades you see me doing all over the world -

0:00:45.780,0:00:50.640
Singapore, Indonesia, those big countries -

0:00:50.640,0:00:56.680
I pay 99% of the money.

0:00:56.680,0:01:03.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:03.300,0:01:09.480
When we are invited to crusade in America, Singapore,

0:01:09.480,0:01:13.860
I would say, "How much is the stadium?"

0:01:13.860,0:01:21.900
If the stadium is $100,000, I would say, "Do you have any area you want to support?"

0:01:21.900,0:01:27.780
They would say, "We are going to rent it". I would say, "No, you can't rent it for me.

0:01:27.780,0:01:31.420
For reasons known to me, we don't control the Holy Spirit.

0:01:31.420,0:01:34.820
Let me pray for whom God wants me to pray for.

0:01:34.820,0:01:45.100
Don't pay and start bringing your brother, sister, cousin or business man for prayer.

0:01:45.100,0:01:51.320
If you pay for the stadium for me, and you invite me for crusade,

0:01:51.320,0:01:59.420
you'll collect money from big business men that are sick, and those are the ones you will arrange in the front for prayer.

0:01:59.420,0:02:04.860
And you will now be telling me, "Pray for this person, don't pray for this person.

0:02:04.860,0:02:09.340
Don't pray for this one; this one - pray for him.

0:02:09.340,0:02:18.560
You have not prayed for this one, Man of God. He's the one that has payed 70% of the money.

0:02:18.560,0:02:28.460
God cannot cooperate or support such an arrangement.

0:02:28.460,0:02:33.700
Or you would be telling me that I should come out at 8 am,

0:02:33.700,0:02:40.380
when the Spirit of God is telling me I should come out at 10 am".

0:02:40.380,0:02:45.220
My accommodation - I don't let them know where I'm going to lodge.

0:02:45.220,0:02:47.560
After the crusade you can know where I'm living

0:02:47.560,0:02:52.260
but before or during the crusade I will not allow you to come to me.

0:02:52.260,0:02:56.680
You organiser, you cannot see me until after the crusade.

0:02:56.680,0:03:00.180
On the last day of the crusade I' would call them, "Follow me home.

0:03:00.180,0:03:07.300
I'm sorry for not showing you where I'm living".

0:03:07.300,0:03:13.220
I will enter your country with money,

0:03:13.220,0:03:18.920
and I will go out of the country and not take your money out of the country.

0:03:18.920,0:03:27.060
It's the rule and regulation because the grace is not for sale.

0:03:27.060,0:03:39.000
My joy is to see people healed, blessed and delivered; that is my money.

0:03:39.000,0:03:44.420
Each person that is delivered is more than $20,000.

0:03:44.420,0:03:50.840
Okay, imagine - in each crusade, almost 500 people get delivered.

0:03:50.840,0:03:59.160
500 times $20,000 - that is the money God is giving me.

0:03:59.160,0:04:03.440
$20,000 times 500.

0:04:03.440,0:04:08.200
You know that it is a huge amount of money, which is more than this money you are talking about.

0:04:08.200,0:04:12.960
The joy to sleep, joy.

0:04:12.960,0:04:16.960
You need to know what it means if God uses you to heal people.

0:04:16.960,0:04:29.660
If you knew what it means if God uses you to deliver people, you would want to deliver people all the time.

0:04:29.660,0:04:35.480
If you knew the joy in using you to deliver people,

0:04:35.480,0:04:39.640
you would never ask the people you deliver to bring kobo or money.

0:04:39.640,0:04:46.800
Anything. Even when they give you, you beg them, "Please, don't destroy my life!"

0:04:46.800,0:04:49.780
If you know what it is, brother, stand up. You are from where?

0:04:49.780,0:04:51.720
Zambia.

0:04:51.720,0:04:54.980
If you know what it is to set you free...

0:04:54.980,0:05:00.280
You are now here with a situation from Zambia.

0:05:00.280,0:05:04.340
If you know what it is to set you free from your problem...

0:05:04.340,0:05:07.640
Ha!

0:05:07.640,0:05:11.000
It's more than trillion dollars! Only you!

0:05:11.000,0:05:15.300
So if you know what it is to set people free, you would never...

0:05:15.300,0:05:20.880
Even after you have set a person free, don't wait for the person to greet you "thank you".

0:05:20.880,0:05:25.380
This "thank you", you don't need it. This is why after praying for you, I leave you.

0:05:25.380,0:05:28.220
I don't want you to say "thank you, sir".

0:05:28.220,0:05:33.500
I don't want that because God has given me something more than "thank you, sir".

0:05:33.500,0:05:40.020
I don't want anything to affect that "thank you, sir".

0:05:40.020,0:05:51.800
If God uses you to remove the pain of one, you are more than a millionaire.

0:05:51.800,0:05:54.340
You people believe that your reward is money.

0:05:54.340,0:05:56.340
No!

0:05:56.340,0:06:00.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:00.440,0:06:06.940
If you know what it means to do something and collect money,

0:06:06.940,0:06:12.100
and that money is your gain,

0:06:12.100,0:06:16.780
you are robbing yourself.

0:06:16.780,0:06:22.460
Something insufficient and that money is what?

0:06:22.460,0:06:27.840
Insufficient! It cannot help you, it cannot give you peace.

0:06:27.840,0:06:36.180
Money can't give you peace; if money can give you peace, many of you would not be here today.

0:06:36.180,0:06:43.160
This is why you just see me at Ikotun Egbe since I started.

0:06:43.160,0:06:45.700
Branch - hmm.

0:06:45.700,0:06:52.780
From Ikotun Egbe to where? Look at glory of God.

0:06:52.780,0:07:00.560
Expansion of the grace can be dangerous if you are not careful.

0:07:00.560,0:07:08.240
If God gives you one dollar and that one dollar increases to 100 dollars,

0:07:08.240,0:07:13.080
it could be very dangerous.

0:07:13.080,0:07:19.560
That is why when the grace of God expands, you too have to be very careful.

0:07:19.560,0:07:26.600
Contain it. If you are no ready, hold it; you can know if you are not ready.

0:07:26.600,0:07:32.540
Like many of us - you do little business, millions of dollars enter your pocket.

0:07:32.540,0:07:36.280
Because you have millions of dollars, you establish many companies.

0:07:36.280,0:07:46.480
Will you be able to contain it, will you be able to hold it, will you be able to have power over this company?

0:07:46.480,0:07:53.600
Or you ministers of God - God called you as a minister, and you start.

0:07:53.600,0:07:57.580
You are gifted with message - powerful message.

0:07:57.580,0:07:59.820
When you are talking, people cry.

0:07:59.820,0:08:03.220
A lot of people keep trooping to your church.

0:08:03.220,0:08:06.500
Because of that, you suddenly anoint this one.

0:08:06.500,0:08:10.220
Stand up - you suddenly anoint this one because your church is growing.

0:08:10.220,0:08:13.240
Anoint this one - your church is growing - a big church.

0:08:13.240,0:08:18.120
Right. Okay, you go to Zambia.

0:08:18.120,0:08:19.540
Go and establish one.

0:08:19.540,0:08:23.040
You - go to Cotonou.

0:08:23.040,0:08:24.140
Go to London.

0:08:24.140,0:08:26.860
Go to America.

0:08:26.860,0:08:31.240
It could be dangerous.

0:08:31.240,0:08:36.940
Because of expansion.

0:08:36.940,0:08:39.760
You can't contain it.

0:08:39.760,0:08:46.380
If you know the expansion is becoming (big)...

0:08:46.380,0:08:47.960
That is it.

0:08:47.960,0:08:49.980
You may be seated, sir.

0:08:49.980,0:08:51.180
Yes.

0:08:51.180,0:08:56.220
When I started, the ministry was booming.

0:08:56.220,0:08:59.080
Branches here, branches there.

0:08:59.080,0:09:03.640
I just said, Please, can you close that branch for God's sake

0:09:03.640,0:09:13.140
because I know I would not be able to stand, even though there's great power".

0:09:13.140,0:09:20.020
But the human side of me -

0:09:20.020,0:09:25.440
I have no anointing to give you; it is God who anoints.

0:09:25.440,0:09:31.940
Suddenly in a hurry, because the church has grown, I anoint you.

0:09:31.940,0:09:37.360
Maturity needs time and experience.

0:09:37.360,0:09:48.260
No matter the mighty power God gives to you, you need to mature over time.

0:09:48.260,0:09:53.000
You can go up and come down again.

0:09:53.000,0:09:55.060
This is what has happened to many of us here -

0:09:55.060,0:10:00.280
you were up there one time but now you start again from here.

0:10:00.280,0:10:05.160
What kind of life is that? Why can't you take it easy

0:10:05.160,0:10:11.620
and go up in a season,

0:10:11.620,0:10:16.940
by obeying season - dry season, rain season.

0:10:16.940,0:10:19.320
Just go up by season.

0:10:19.320,0:10:25.780
But you go up and down again.

0:10:25.780,0:10:28.060
We serve God with our life.

0:10:28.060,0:10:30.500
Tell your neighbour: We serve God with our life.

0:10:30.500,0:10:35.880
But you believe you serve God with the Bible.

0:10:35.880,0:10:39.920
You read the Bible and you serve God with the Bible - "Jesus said this, Jesus said that".

0:10:39.920,0:10:43.820
You have forgotten your life.

0:10:43.820,0:10:47.560
You have to serve God with your life, not only with the Bible.

0:10:47.560,0:10:49.340
That's what the Bible says.

0:10:49.340,0:10:54.020
You seem to forget to serve God with your life.

0:10:54.020,0:10:57.640
Do you know that your life preaches better than your mouth?

0:10:57.640,0:11:01.280
If you are telling me, "Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Lord" -

0:11:01.280,0:11:04.840
that one is not strong enough; let your life say it.

0:11:04.840,0:11:11.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:11.340,0:11:19.980
If I stand here and begin to tell you, "Jesus is Lord", "Jesus is Saviour", "Jesus is this", "Jesus is that"...

0:11:19.980,0:11:26.660
But your life can preach better - your life; mere looking at your life.

0:11:26.660,0:11:28.440
It can preach better.

0:11:28.440,0:11:33.240
A better sermon. Say, "My life can preach a better sermon".

0:11:33.240,0:11:34.440
I can't hear you.

0:11:34.440,0:11:36.160
My life can preach a better sermon.

0:11:36.160,0:11:37.240
I can't hear you.

0:11:37.240,0:11:38.880
My life can preach a better sermon.

0:11:38.880,0:11:46.460
So does your life preach? It is your mouth that preaches, not your life.

0:11:46.460,0:11:49.560
Look at me - without even talking.

0:11:49.560,0:11:54.500
If you just walk out and say, "Ok, who is this man?" You go on YouTube.

0:11:54.500,0:11:57.700
Look - I travelled to Israel. I was telling you people

0:11:57.700,0:12:00.680
that they were telling me I should not talk, that they know me.

0:12:00.680,0:12:06.360
They were telling me what I'm doing and they could see...

0:12:06.360,0:12:16.320
This is what they were talking about in Nazareth, Capernaum and all others.

0:12:16.320,0:12:21.520
I was glad; I was looking at them.

0:12:21.520,0:12:34.460
So that is my life. I didn't preach this time; my life preached to them.

0:12:34.460,0:12:37.580
God's time is the best.

0:12:37.580,0:12:41.400
What you have just seen -

0:12:41.400,0:12:47.500
whatever decision of God, I have no life of mine.

0:12:47.500,0:12:53.880
If the Lord says yes, who am I to say no?

0:12:53.880,0:12:57.860
God has a purpose of sending me to your midst.

0:12:57.860,0:13:01.580
There's a purpose for sending me to your midst.

0:13:01.580,0:13:04.440
Yes.

0:13:04.440,0:13:09.400
At the same time, there's a purpose of taking me to Israel.

0:13:09.400,0:13:17.900
Maybe God wants you to appreciate me and God of T.B. Joshua better.

0:13:17.900,0:13:24.080
By the time you want to see me, you have to pay for a ticket to fly to Israel.

0:13:24.080,0:13:26.180
I'm going there to see.

0:13:26.180,0:13:31.220
You will appreciate it better.

0:13:31.220,0:13:34.480
And you know, right from the beginning of this ministry,

0:13:34.480,0:13:40.540
it is the ministry that is the most persecuted in the world.

0:13:40.540,0:13:43.340
The most persecuted ministry.

0:13:43.340,0:13:46.400
Who are the people persecuting the ministry?

0:13:46.400,0:13:51.800
My people - Africa.

0:13:51.800,0:13:54.120
I take it back again.

0:13:54.120,0:13:59.580
This ministry is the most persecuted ministry in the world.

0:13:59.580,0:14:04.280
There's no name my people have not called,

0:14:04.280,0:14:07.360
and there's nothing they have not done.

0:14:07.360,0:14:10.780
Strange thing!

0:14:10.780,0:14:12.240
Who are the people?

0:14:12.240,0:14:18.540
My people - Africa!

0:14:18.540,0:14:24.980
It has not been an easy thing, if not God.

0:14:24.980,0:14:32.700
That is why I choose to live a lonely life.

0:14:32.700,0:14:35.780
If you want to see me, come to this church.

0:14:35.780,0:14:39.540
I don't go out; that is a lonely life.

0:14:39.540,0:14:47.580
It has not been easy because I don't know who is a friend and who is an enemy.

0:14:47.580,0:14:49.020
I don't know.

0:14:49.020,0:14:53.760
I would have loved to come to your wedding, your ceremony,

0:14:53.760,0:14:58.940
inviting me, sitting at the table, eating rice and chicken.

0:14:58.940,0:15:03.600
But I don't trust anyone anymore,

0:15:03.600,0:15:10.080
talkless of eating in your house.

0:15:10.080,0:15:18.420
But yet, I'm always in your midst; right from the beginning of the ministry.

0:15:18.420,0:15:25.620
Since thirty years of the ministry, I have always been with you people.

0:15:25.620,0:15:30.900
If I go for revival, after the revival, I come back.

0:15:30.900,0:15:32.960
I don't miss you peopie; I love you people.

0:15:32.960,0:15:42.800
Upon the prosecution and hatred, I decided to love you, to take the path of love.

0:15:42.800,0:15:48.020
You show hatred; I show love.

0:15:48.020,0:15:53.340
But I want to say something: I love you so much.

0:15:53.340,0:15:59.480
And I will always stand for the path of love.

0:15:59.480,0:16:06.740
Anytime you pray, remember Africa in prayer.

0:16:06.740,0:16:13.920
Many heroes, many great people - they have chased them out of Africa.

0:16:13.920,0:16:19.840
What has happened to me right from the beginning of this ministry is enough to chase me out of this country.

0:16:19.840,0:16:26.340
What has happened to me has never happened to any minister of God in this world.

0:16:26.340,0:16:30.100
Mention any minister of God it has happened to.

0:16:30.100,0:16:31.380
No.

0:16:31.380,0:16:35.220
In this world, no minister of God.

0:16:35.220,0:16:37.980
But I'm still in your midst.

0:16:37.980,0:16:44.080
There were enough to chase me out of Nigeria, Africa.

0:16:44.080,0:16:52.160
But I will go for revivals, and at the revivals, you will always see the stadium full.

0:16:52.160,0:16:55.780
The country, ministers - all of them gather.

0:16:55.780,0:17:01.040
But I am not carried away by that; after the crusade - back home.

0:17:01.040,0:17:04.760
Back to Africa where I am being persecuted,

0:17:04.760,0:17:13.460
where they want me to be killed, destroyed.

0:17:13.460,0:17:20.180
I live where I am not celebrated; I left the place where I am celebrated.

0:17:20.180,0:17:24.360
I'm celebrated all over the world but I left the place.

0:17:24.360,0:17:29.580
I'm living where I am not celebrated.

0:17:29.580,0:17:33.780
I want to pray with you. You put this thing behind you so we can move forward.

0:17:33.780,0:17:39.900
I'm only expressing the happening, the journey so far.

0:17:39.900,0:17:41.920
Okay.

0:17:41.920,0:17:57.500
Bow down your head and ask God to give you a hearing heart, in Jesus Christ's name.

0:17:57.500,0:18:02.480
Ask God to give you strength, so you will not give up.

0:18:02.480,0:18:04.020
Don't give up

0:18:04.020,0:18:10.600
Where you are not celebrated is the best place to stay, to get strength.

0:18:10.600,0:18:17.000
When you are in the midst of battle, you are building yourself; it's good.

0:18:17.000,0:18:22.360
Where you are not celebrated, where you are being persecuted is the best place for you to live.

0:18:22.360,0:18:26.180
It will build vou; all this will build you.

0:18:26.180,0:18:29.480
Gold cannot be gold without passing through the furnace.

0:18:29.480,0:18:32.900
Human character too needs to pass through the furnace.

0:18:32.900,0:18:41.380
That is why I decided to stay where I'm not celebrated - here in Nigeria, here in Africa.

0:18:41.380,0:18:46.360
I stayed there to build the grace of God.

0:18:46.360,0:18:50.440
When the grace of God is in the midst of challenges,  it gets stronger.

0:18:50.440,0:18:53.420
So that is why I stayed in your midst.

0:18:53.420,0:18:59.520
Ask God to give you the grace to stay where you are not celebrated.
