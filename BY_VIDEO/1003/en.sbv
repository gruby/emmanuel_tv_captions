You need to know who you are.

0:00:05.240,0:00:20.020
I am a spirit; you are a spirit living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world.

0:00:20.020,0:00:26.800
I listen to my spirit because it is controlled by the Holy Spirit

0:00:26.800,0:00:33.960
for I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.

0:00:33.960,0:00:38.500
I examine my leading in the light of God's Word.

0:00:38.500,0:00:42.080
So, you must know who you are.

0:00:42.080,0:00:45.400
Open your lips and confess this with me.

0:00:45.400,0:01:04.440
I am a spirit living in a physical body, 
learning to live in the natural world.

0:01:04.440,0:01:12.820
I listen to the voice of my spirit because it is controlled by the Holy Spirit

0:01:12.820,0:01:20.520
for I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.

0:01:20.520,0:01:30.100
I examine my leading in the light of God's Word, in Jesus' name.

0:01:30.100,0:01:35.860
Viewers all over the world, I know you are there.

0:01:35.860,0:01:43.600
You are a spirit; we only live in the physical body.

0:01:43.600,0:01:47.500
With God, all things are possible.

0:01:47.500,0:01:53.860
In Jesus Chist's name, we pray.

0:01:53.860,0:02:09.460
