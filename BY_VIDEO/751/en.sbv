Faith comes by hearing.

0:00:08.920,0:00:18.320
That is why we need to hear about healing anointing.

0:00:18.320,0:00:24.360
That is why we need to hear about blessing anointing.

0:00:24.360,0:00:29.840
That is why we need to hear about delivering anointing.

0:00:29.840,0:00:31.320
I will take it again.

0:00:31.320,0:00:35.700
Faith comes by hearing.

0:00:35.700,0:00:45.960
That is why we need to hear about what? - Healing anointing,

0:00:45.960,0:00:52.500
deliverance anointing and blessing anointing.

0:00:52.500,0:00:55.100
Faith comes by hearing.

0:00:55.100,0:01:06.340
We all know Jesus always responds to those who put a demand on Him.

0:01:06.340,0:01:09.180
Always.

0:01:09.180,0:01:19.000
He always responds to those who put what? - A demand on Him.

0:01:19.000,0:01:27.260
What a blessing to teach people who are hungry for the Word!

0:01:27.260,0:01:28.960
You know..

0:01:28.960,0:01:34.020
When you have people who are hungry for the Word and you are teaching them - what a blessing!

0:01:34.020,0:01:38.220
So I believe I'm in the midst of people who are hungry for the Word.

0:01:38.220,0:01:40.020
Are you one of them?

0:01:40.020,0:01:41.240
I can't hear you.

0:01:41.240,0:01:43.480
[Yes!]

0:01:43.480,0:01:46.100
Thank you! Hallelujah!

0:01:46.100,0:01:52.400
Now the job is half done; you have scored fifty percent.

0:01:52.400,0:01:59.340
I say you have scored fifty percent.

0:01:59.340,0:02:03.840
If you even decide to leave from here now

0:02:03.840,0:02:08.780
and then maintain the one you have received, it is OK.

0:02:08.780,0:02:11.580
So let's talk about maintenance.

0:02:11.580,0:02:15.780
Hallelujah!! What we have been listening to since morning,

0:02:15.780,0:02:20.300
if you can meditate over it, over and over and over...

0:02:20.300,0:02:31.900
This is what your enemy does not want you to hear!

0:02:31.900,0:02:37.520
You know many times when you are at home and you are listening to Emmanuel TV,

0:02:37.520,0:02:40.400
there are a lot of distractions.

0:02:40.400,0:02:47.340
So the time you have to pay attention to what you hear now is always difficult for you out there

0:02:47.340,0:02:51.220
because there are so many things to attend to.

0:02:51.220,0:02:53.800
So I want to say congratulations once again!

0:02:53.800,0:03:01.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:01.100,0:03:03.200
Hallelujah.

0:03:03.200,0:03:06.220
Let us pray for the viewers.

0:03:06.220,0:03:09.400
We want them to have the right focus

0:03:09.400,0:03:19.060
because you know what it means if you are out there, in the midst of confusion, distractions.

0:03:19.060,0:03:22.120
Here, you switch off your set.

0:03:22.120,0:03:26.840
You don't want to hear anything; you have so much grace.

0:03:26.840,0:03:32.080
But over there, our viewers at home, anywhere they are,

0:03:32.080,0:03:38.080
we know the situation they are in - so many distractions.

0:03:38.080,0:03:48.580
So let us pray for them and ask God to give them the right focus in the midst of all.

0:03:48.580,0:03:50.800
Stretch your hand. Let's pray together.

0:03:50.800,0:04:04.700
Viewers all over the world, we want to be like Jesus in our heart.

0:04:04.700,0:04:13.160
We pray for right focus, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:13.160,0:04:18.560
Whatever is disturbing you right now -

0:04:18.560,0:04:27.180
our heart is always going up and down, thinking about this and that -

0:04:27.180,0:04:29.340
leave it for God!

0:04:29.340,0:04:34.640
We pray for right focus, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:34.640,0:04:39.920
Right focus, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:39.920,0:04:43.620
Begin to receive a hearing heart!

0:04:43.620,0:04:51.020
A hearing heart!

0:04:51.020,0:04:52.920
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:04:55.540,0:04:56.720
Thank You, Lord!

0:04:56.720,0:05:01.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:01.340,0:05:04.000
Faith comes by hearing.

0:05:04.000,0:05:12.660
That is why we need to hear about about what? - Healing anointing.

0:05:12.660,0:05:16.340
And once you hear it, put a demand on it.

0:05:16.340,0:05:23.200
When the healing is going on, put a demand on it. If you are sick, you will be healed.

0:05:23.200,0:05:27.180
Blessing anointing - when you hear it being pronounced on a person

0:05:27.180,0:05:31.800
and you need blessing, put a demand on that blessing anointing

0:05:31.800,0:05:33.580
and you will be blessed!

0:05:33.580,0:05:36.140
How do we put a demand?

0:05:36.140,0:05:41.380
Get connected; just believe.

0:05:41.380,0:05:44.820
If there is actually God in the true processing -

0:05:44.820,0:05:49.260
true processing means that it is given to us for free and we shall give it to you for free -

0:05:49.260,0:05:51.220
without the exchange of money.

0:05:51.220,0:05:55.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:55.480,0:06:04.960
Deliverance cannot take place without God's processing.

0:06:04.960,0:06:09.400
Healing cannot take place without God's processing.

0:06:09.400,0:06:10.980
Blessing can never...

0:06:10.980,0:06:14.320
If somebody says, "I am blessed",

0:06:14.320,0:06:19.220
are you sure it is God's blessing, or are you talking of man's blessing?

0:06:19.220,0:06:24.480
If it is God's blessing, it must go through God's processing.

0:06:24.480,0:06:29.060
There is a process for everything.

0:06:29.060,0:06:36.040
Processing is more important than the result itself.

0:06:36.040,0:06:40.340
You say you are rich. Okay, a rich man.

0:06:40.340,0:06:52.040
How you become rich is bigger than your riches - your result.

0:06:52.040,0:06:55.720
Processing is bigger than the result itself.

0:06:55.720,0:07:00.740
How you get there is bigger than getting there.

0:07:00.740,0:07:02.160
This is the problem with people -

0:07:02.160,0:07:09.680
everybody wants to be big and get there by following any processing.

0:07:09.680,0:07:15.680
No! The processing will help you to maintain the result.

0:07:15.680,0:07:25.880
If the processing is tampered with or if the processing is not God's processing,

0:07:25.880,0:07:29.680
you will not be able to maintain that result.

0:07:29.680,0:07:34.200
So you say, "Oh yes! You become rich".

0:07:34.200,0:07:38.460
What processing takes you to those riches?

0:07:38.460,0:07:44.740
It matters because to maintain those riches, you need that processing.

0:07:44.740,0:07:51.000
If it is not God's processing and you get there, you cannot maintain the riches.

0:07:51.000,0:07:56.060
It will disappoint you at a dear time you need it.

0:07:56.060,0:08:03.980
That is why you see people who were very rich and today they are poor.

0:08:03.980,0:08:09.120
Very rich. At the time of need, the money is gone.

0:08:09.120,0:08:12.560
They say, "Ah! The man is there, he is just..."

0:08:12.560,0:08:15.320
It is all about processing.

0:08:15.320,0:08:20.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:20.300,0:08:24.620
Healing must go through God's processing.

0:08:24.620,0:08:28.360
So processing is greater than results

0:08:28.360,0:08:29.720
What matters is processing.

0:08:29.720,0:08:31.700
Tell your neighbour: What matters is processing!

0:08:31.700,0:08:33.100
What matters is processing.

0:08:33.100,0:08:34.240
I can't hear you.

0:08:34.240,0:08:36.140
What matters is processing.

0:08:36.140,0:08:37.200
I can't hear you.

0:08:37.200,0:08:38.840
What matters is processing

0:08:38.840,0:08:39.880
Again and again!

0:08:39.880,0:08:41.820
What matters is processing.

0:08:41.820,0:08:52.200
It is processing!

0:08:52.200,0:09:01.180
So the manner we process our lives is what is working against us or working for us.

0:09:01.180,0:09:03.920
You want to get married?

0:09:03.920,0:09:11.140
What is the processing of getting married to that man - is it in line with God?

0:09:11.140,0:09:17.560
Or the man is handsome that is why you married that man, or the man has money.

0:09:17.560,0:09:22.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:22.140,0:09:26.260
If it is in line with God that you get married,

0:09:26.260,0:09:33.580
that processing will stand for any challenges that you may have in that marriage.

0:09:33.580,0:09:36.880
What can separate men from the love of God?

0:09:36.880,0:09:42.060
Nothing, if the processing is of God.

0:09:42.060,0:09:44.900
What can separate me from the marriage?

0:09:44.900,0:09:51.660
If that marriage follows God's processing, nothing can separate you.

0:09:51.660,0:09:56.940
Nothing that you will hear your husband has done, your wife has done -

0:09:56.940,0:10:02.200
you will still ask God, you want to know God's opinion.

0:10:02.200,0:10:05.380
No matter what happens to the marriage, you still want to know God's opinion

0:10:05.380,0:10:13.800
because God can use any foolish thing to strengthen the marriage.

0:10:13.800,0:10:21.180
Your business today - you jump from one business to another because of crises.

0:10:21.180,0:10:25.920
When you invest in a business and it is not yet coming, you abandon the business.

0:10:25.920,0:10:29.360
You cannot abandon a business because of lust.

0:10:29.360,0:10:34.820
You cannot abandon a business because of sickness.

0:10:34.820,0:10:39.360
You lost, you have spent money, you run bankrupt.

0:10:39.360,0:10:44.340
You can't abandon your business because of those things.

0:10:44.340,0:10:51.400
You can only abandon a business when God says, "Quit!"

0:10:51.400,0:10:53.500
The same thing in marriage -

0:10:53.500,0:10:58.400
you cannot abandon your marriage because of crises.

0:10:58.400,0:11:02.380
You cannot abandon your marriage because of challenges.

0:11:02.380,0:11:07.440
No matter what happens to this marriage, you cannot abandon your marriage because of that.

0:11:07.440,0:11:11.160
Unless God says, "Quit!"

0:11:11.160,0:11:17.760
If the processing of your marriage is in line with God, nothing can separate you.

0:11:17.760,0:11:22.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:22.020,0:11:26.460
Sometimes, God can allow foolish things on our way.

0:11:26.460,0:11:31.360
Those foolish things are college, school - you need to go to school of embarrassment,

0:11:31.360,0:11:37.580
school of praises, school of persecution, school of progress, school of failure.

0:11:37.580,0:11:41.480
Many of you that are here today - if I had not graduated in persecution,

0:11:41.480,0:11:46.040
how would I be telling you of persecution?

0:11:46.040,0:11:51.920
If I had not graduated in accusation, how could I be telling you about accusation?

0:11:51.920,0:11:55.780
If I had not gone through the school of hatred -

0:11:55.780,0:11:59.940
I know much about hatred; people hate me so dearly.

0:11:59.940,0:12:04.380
If I had not gone through and graduated in that,

0:12:04.380,0:12:08.100
how would I be standing here and counsel you about hatred?

0:12:08.100,0:12:16.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:16.860,0:12:21.840
It is just like that!

0:12:21.840,0:12:23.300
Processing - tell your neighbour!

0:12:23.300,0:12:24.460
Processing!

0:12:24.460,0:12:25.820
Processing is very important!

0:12:25.820,0:12:30.860
This is what Paul meant when he said, "What can separate me from the love of God?"

0:12:30.860,0:12:34.980
Can death, sickness or disease?

0:12:34.980,0:12:37.540
He is talking about processing.

0:12:37.540,0:12:41.380
If his love for God is in line with the scriptures...

0:12:41.380,0:12:43.240
You say, I am a Christian.

0:12:43.240,0:12:53.100
When you become a Christian in line with the scriptures, nothing can separate you.

0:12:53.100,0:12:55.640
Listen again.

0:12:55.640,0:13:04.280
If your marriage is in line with God, with the scriptures, nothing can separate you from that marriage.

0:13:04.280,0:13:08.040
Trouble will come, disappointments will come, failure will come.

0:13:08.040,0:13:14.440
No! It will come! It will just come and strengthen the marriage.

0:13:14.440,0:13:21.400
Even sickness will come - it will just come. After that sickness, the marriage will be strengthened.

0:13:21.400,0:13:26.260
Disappointment will come - they will come and tell you, "We saw your wife in so and so place.

0:13:26.260,0:13:32.720
Your wife is going out with this so and so. Oh, this is the phone number!" You even see the phone number.

0:13:32.720,0:13:41.680
You still need to ask God's opinion about the matter.

0:13:41.680,0:13:49.700
You just need to ask God's opinion about the matter.

0:13:49.700,0:13:55.500
If God brings you to a relationship, the same God will quit you.

0:13:55.500,0:13:59.820
But if you bring yourself to a relationship, you quit yourself.

0:13:59.820,0:14:01.400
How did you come about the marriage?

0:14:01.400,0:14:06.580
When you come to the marriage by yourself and not by God, you quit when trouble comes.

0:14:06.580,0:14:10.460
But when God brings you to a relationship, no matter what happens,

0:14:10.460,0:14:15.100
it is the same God who will quit you when it is time.

0:14:15.100,0:14:21.320
If you have not heard from God, no matter what happens, you must go through it.

0:14:21.320,0:14:31.180
God's processing is the mind of God.

0:14:31.180,0:14:38.200
Now you can say that processing is greater than the result itself.

0:14:38.200,0:14:43.320
If you follow the right processing and you are not getting the result,

0:14:43.320,0:14:49.300
don't worry!

0:14:49.300,0:14:56.160
You are about to get the mother of results.

0:14:56.160,0:14:59.800
You know there is what we call the mother of miracle.

0:14:59.800,0:15:04.900
You do the right thing, but yet, there is no result.

0:15:04.900,0:15:06.760
Don't be disappointed.

0:15:06.760,0:15:10.340
If you have done the right thing and you are expecting the result to come,

0:15:10.340,0:15:14.720
all you need to do is to be patient

0:15:14.720,0:15:19.340
Look at Hannah and Samuel!

0:15:19.340,0:15:24.960
You are about to get the mother of results.

0:15:24.960,0:15:29.460
Look at your case - sometimes you feel sick as a Christian,

0:15:29.460,0:15:31.480
you run to God for prayer.

0:15:31.480,0:15:35.240
The more you pray, it seems that the sickness is still there.

0:15:35.240,0:15:37.540
You keep praying, the sickness is still there.

0:15:37.540,0:15:43.460
It is not that God does not hear you.

0:15:43.460,0:15:47.940
God may realise that that sickness will strengthen you better,

0:15:47.940,0:15:52.860
it will strengthen your desire for Him better than healing.

0:15:52.860,0:15:55.080
He will allow you to go through that sickness

0:15:55.080,0:16:00.180
so that He can strengthen your desire and your determination for Him.

0:16:00.180,0:16:04.860
When we are sick, we keep seeking His face and fast more.

0:16:04.860,0:16:07.760
But the moment we are healed, we relax.

0:16:07.760,0:16:14.380
So when God realises that your going through the sickness will strengthen your desire for Him,

0:16:14.380,0:16:17.080
better than when you are healed.

0:16:17.080,0:16:22.580
Or God may realise that your situation may strengthen your desire, your determination for God,

0:16:22.580,0:16:24.180
to move you closer to God.

0:16:24.180,0:16:26.340
When you have challenges, troubles,

0:16:26.340,0:16:33.460
He will leave you until you are very strong - too strong.

0:16:33.460,0:16:35.420
Then you get healed.

0:16:35.420,0:16:41.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:41.180,0:16:49.340
He is only concerned about the relationship; it is our relationship that matters.

0:16:49.340,0:16:53.700
Many of us are here today for what you have been asking God to do for you.

0:16:53.700,0:16:59.060
Your business - you want it to prosper. It is not that God does not hear. God hears.

0:16:59.060,0:17:07.380
But God realises that when your business prospers, you are likely not able to sit among your people.

0:17:07.380,0:17:13.300
You will allow this wealth to start controlling you, instead of the source of that wealth to control you.

0:17:13.300,0:17:18.580
When you have so much money, money will now begin to control you.

0:17:18.580,0:17:20.560
I need to go to the meeting,

0:17:20.560,0:17:22.860
I need to go to sign a contract,

0:17:22.860,0:17:24.560
I need to do this -

0:17:24.560,0:17:30.900
instead of the source of that, the One who gave you the money to control you.

0:17:30.900,0:17:34.540
OK, look at it.

0:17:34.540,0:17:43.080
Where you live today, is what your possession can purchase.

0:17:43.080,0:17:48.440
When you live in a village and you have money, you will abandon the village.

0:17:48.440,0:17:51.060
You go to the city because money has come.

0:17:51.060,0:17:55.700
It is nature, it is natural - that is human being for you.

0:17:55.700,0:17:58.740
That if you are living in a village

0:17:58.740,0:18:05.200
and later you have a business and money comes, you will abandon the village for the city.

0:18:05.200,0:18:12.780
It means that it is the money that is controlling us and not the Giver.

0:18:12.780,0:18:16.420
You can be very rich and still remain in that village -

0:18:16.420,0:18:23.280
develop the village, give them light, build your house and live among your people.

0:18:23.280,0:18:25.440
But today, we abandon our people.

0:18:25.440,0:18:30.420
Once the money comes, we go to a better place; we look for our colleagues.

0:18:30.420,0:18:36.380
If you are less privileged and you are rich, you move to the privileged people.

0:18:36.380,0:18:45.300
It is the money that is controlling us. We go into our stature.

0:18:45.300,0:18:47.400
That is it.

0:18:47.400,0:18:53.520
Some churches you see arrange for different seats.

0:18:53.520,0:19:00.740
When you just enter a place of worship, you can see that this is where big people sit.

0:19:00.740,0:19:05.340
This is where privileged people sit.

0:19:05.340,0:19:12.160
This is where the less privileged people sit.

0:19:12.160,0:19:15.280
Who is privileged before God? Who is less privileged before God?

0:19:15.280,0:19:19.400
Who is rich before God? Who is famous before God?

0:19:19.400,0:19:23.340
God is concerned about the souls that are saved.

0:19:23.340,0:19:31.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:31.720,0:19:37.800
No matter the situation you are in, you can begin to feel the presence of God

0:19:37.800,0:19:44.120
by beginning to have it in your mind that you are not alone

0:19:44.120,0:19:47.720
Like I am here now, I am not alone.

0:19:47.720,0:19:52.520
So, if I want to say something, you check me.

0:19:52.520,0:19:57.060
I would not want to say anything that He would not want to hear.

0:19:57.060,0:20:05.000
You have to engage Him to show that you know Him and that He is with you.

0:20:05.000,0:20:11.680
You have to be talking when someone is talking to you.

0:20:11.680,0:20:15.340
When someone is addressing you, don't remain silent - talk.

0:20:15.340,0:20:20.200
So that you can erase whatever that is not pleasant.

0:20:20.200,0:20:24.220
And on the phone, when you are receiving a phone call - "Hello!"

0:20:24.220,0:20:31.200
You too - when you say that "hello", say another one in the spirit

0:20:31.200,0:20:34.360
to arrest any situation, any message you want to hear.

0:20:34.360,0:20:36.100
"Hello, how are you?" - "Fine."

0:20:36.100,0:20:39.000
"Where are you now?" - "Mmh."

0:20:39.000,0:20:42.940
You say your prayer before you respond.

0:20:42.940,0:20:49.060
That is to show that you are not alone.

0:20:49.060,0:20:55.160
So like you are watching me, you have to be saying your prayer.

0:20:55.160,0:20:57.740
This is how you will start.

0:20:57.740,0:21:01.220
When you start here, you will continue to do that.

0:21:01.220,0:21:05.220
When you start here, you will continue to pray. Like when I am talking to you, you have to say something

0:21:05.220,0:21:07.520
Begin to say something.

0:21:07.520,0:21:14.100
Don't keep silent - if you are silent, your God will be silent.

0:21:14.100,0:21:17.180
If you talk, your God will talk.

0:21:17.180,0:21:20.720
If you are silent, we cannot place you.

0:21:20.720,0:21:24.900
"Mmh." - "T.B. Joshua, how are you?"

0:21:24.900,0:21:29.220
You cannot place me - whether I said fine or not fine.

0:21:29.220,0:21:30.400
"Mmh."

0:21:30.400,0:21:34.760
For you to place me, I have to talk.

0:21:34.760,0:21:39.840
It is still processing; we should cherish processing.

0:21:39.840,0:21:43.160
Let me give you a good example of this word 'processing'.

0:21:43.160,0:21:49.420
I want to pray for you now, but in my heart - now that I am coming to you - I begin to doubt.

0:21:49.420,0:21:53.720
"Will God heal this woman? I don't know."

0:21:53.720,0:21:57.780
"And I am a liar. I don't think God will heal this woman."

0:21:57.780,0:22:01.620
"Will God heal this woman? I don't think God will heal this woman."

0:22:01.620,0:22:03.580
"Be healed! Be healed!"

0:22:03.580,0:22:06.620
God cannot heal because the processing is wrong.

0:22:06.620,0:22:11.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:11.900,0:22:15.220
The processing is wrong - from here to where you are.

0:22:15.220,0:22:17.980
What is going through my heart, what is going through my mind -

0:22:17.980,0:22:21.440
it is processing; we call it ingredients.

0:22:21.440,0:22:27.060
To make a soup - if you don't have a good processing in putting those ingredients together,

0:22:27.060,0:22:29.440
you can't have a wonderful soup.

0:22:29.440,0:22:33.760
But when you put those ingredients together - pepper soup or whatever soup you want to make,

0:22:33.760,0:22:38.800
a good one - by the time you finish cooking it, people will enjoy the soup.

0:22:38.800,0:22:44.000
The same way with prayer, the same way with your life,

0:22:44.000,0:22:49.220
the same way with whatever you will become in the future.

0:22:49.220,0:22:50.860
Let us once say, processing.

0:22:50.860,0:22:51.960
Processing.

0:22:51.960,0:22:52.940
I can't hear you.

0:22:52.940,0:22:53.940
Processing.

0:22:53.940,0:22:54.780
I can't hear you.

0:22:54.780,0:22:55.760
Processing.

0:22:55.760,0:22:56.720
I can't hear you.

0:22:56.720,0:22:57.880
Processing.

0:22:57.880,0:23:06.240
The processing of your life is what is affecting you today.

0:23:06.240,0:23:08.960
The processing - how you started.

0:23:08.960,0:23:13.660
At the beginning, in those days, when you said, "If I finish university, I will settle down.

0:23:13.660,0:23:17.640
I will get this, I will get that. I will have a wife.

0:23:17.640,0:23:19.900
I will have children - a boy and a girl.

0:23:19.900,0:23:21.500
It's okay, I will settle down".

0:23:21.500,0:23:24.560
But after you have had all this,

0:23:24.560,0:23:31.360
what you are looking for, you have not yet got it.

0:23:31.360,0:23:38.360
You say, "If I travel to America, I will stay there and work".

0:23:38.360,0:23:42.880
Processing.

0:23:42.880,0:23:47.520
We should cherish processing more  than the result.

0:23:47.520,0:23:48.520
Tell your neighbour.

0:23:48.520,0:23:51.600
We should cherish processing more  than the result.

0:23:51.600,0:23:52.680
I can't hear you.

0:23:52.680,0:23:54.920
We should cherish processing more  than the result.

0:23:54.920,0:23:55.940
I can't hear you!

0:23:55.940,0:23:58.400
We should cherish processing more  than the result.

0:23:58.400,0:24:06.260
The processing we are talking about that is not in line with God is the food of witchcraft.

0:24:06.260,0:24:13.240
When you go by a processing that is not in line with God, that is what witchcraft eats.

0:24:13.240,0:24:17.940
When you have something which witchcraft would eat, it will come to you and attack you.

0:24:17.940,0:24:24.060
They eat unfaithfulness, they eat disobedience, they eat hatred.

0:24:24.060,0:24:29.460
They eat pride and you are a very proud person.

0:24:29.460,0:24:33.820
Witchcraft will come to you because that is their food.

0:24:33.820,0:24:37.700
Lying - you know how to lie. Witchcraft will come to you and afflict you

0:24:37.700,0:24:42.460
because the food of witchcraft is lying.

0:24:42.460,0:24:50.400
Disobedience, unfaithfulness, pride, self-centeredness - these are the foods of witchcraft.

0:24:50.400,0:24:56.360
When you go by that processing to build your life, business or career,

0:24:56.360,0:25:00.680
whatever you build in line with all this, you are giving food for witchcraft.

0:25:00.680,0:25:04.940
Witchcraft will be part of you.

0:25:04.940,0:25:06.580
Let someone say, processing.

0:25:06.580,0:25:07.600
Processing.

0:25:07.600,0:25:08.440
I can't hear you!

0:25:08.440,0:25:09.460
Processing.

0:25:09.460,0:25:10.240
I can't hear you!

0:25:10.240,0:25:11.100
Processing.

0:25:11.100,0:25:11.980
That's all.

0:25:11.980,0:25:14.280
Cherish processing more than the result.

0:25:14.280,0:25:15.300
Tell your neighbour.

0:25:15.300,0:25:17.360
Cherish processing more than the result.

0:25:17.360,0:25:18.440
I can't hear you!

0:25:18.440,0:25:20.920
Cherish processing more than the result.

0:25:20.920,0:25:31.560
That you are in line with God to build your career, business, does not mean you will not be attacked.

0:25:31.560,0:25:34.880
But each attack - promotion.

0:25:34.880,0:25:40.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:40.140,0:25:41.700
Take note of that.

0:25:41.700,0:25:45.460
Because if I don't put that one now, you would just say,

0:25:45.460,0:25:49.260
"What this man is saying - I'm in line with God but I'm being attacked".

0:25:49.260,0:25:55.080
If you are in line with God, follow God full step, completely

0:25:55.080,0:26:00.840
in whatever you are doing - faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control and humility -

0:26:00.840,0:26:04.480
to build your life, marriage and children.

0:26:04.480,0:26:07.440
There will be a big attack.

0:26:07.440,0:26:11.600
The bigger your attack, the greater your improvement.

0:26:11.600,0:26:16.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:16.400,0:26:25.700
That is why today when you learn that - "Ah! Something happened to this man!"

0:26:25.700,0:26:34.740
What you will hear from people is, "If it is God's position, if it is God that called him, he will prevail".

0:26:34.740,0:26:38.640
When the incident happened in the church here,

0:26:38.640,0:26:44.000
the mind of everybody was that if he is called by God,

0:26:44.000,0:26:47.520
no Jupiter - the whole world cannot stop him.

0:26:47.520,0:26:51.660
But if he is not called by God, the incident will bring him down.

0:26:51.660,0:26:59.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:59.360,0:27:07.640
This is what Gamaliel, a professor, said. He said, "Leave this man!"

0:27:07.640,0:27:10.640
"Leave this man!

0:27:10.640,0:27:17.300
If what he is doing is from God, you will not be able to bring him down,

0:27:17.300,0:27:20.940
whatever you do to him you are doing it to yourself.

0:27:20.940,0:27:22.980
Leave him alone!

0:27:22.980,0:27:30.200
But if what he is doing is of man's origin, you will get rid of him".

0:27:30.200,0:27:34.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:34.840,0:27:43.560
That you are in line with God, you follow God's steps, step-by-step to build your life,

0:27:43.560,0:27:48.840
does not mean attacks and challenges will not come

0:27:48.840,0:28:02.320
but when they come, each challenge will take you higher.

0:28:02.320,0:28:07.060
Once again - processing.

0:28:07.060,0:28:12.660
Cherish processing more than results.

0:28:12.660,0:28:13.820
Tell your neighbour.

0:28:13.820,0:28:26.700
When you want to achieve something, what you do to achieve it is better than the achievement.

0:28:26.700,0:28:28.140
Look at your education today.

0:28:28.140,0:28:36.320
You say you are a professor, you are a graduate, you have studied, you face challenges.

0:28:36.320,0:28:41.600
If you know what you went through to achieve the position you have achieved,

0:28:41.600,0:28:46.180
it is the processing that is working against us.

0:28:46.180,0:28:51.520
We get it and leave God behind.

0:28:51.520,0:28:56.020
We can read and understand what we are reading but we don't know that

0:28:56.020,0:29:01.100
education is not success but it is to help us get success.

0:29:01.100,0:29:05.820
There is what we call supernatural gift.

0:29:05.820,0:29:10.400
Human natural gift - when you have this human natural gift,

0:29:10.400,0:29:14.460
you can come out first class, the best student in the school.

0:29:14.460,0:29:21.700
But there is a difference between supernatural and human natural gift.

0:29:21.700,0:29:28.580
You can be the most intelligent, the most brilliant student in the world, coming out first class -

0:29:28.580,0:29:31.640
human natural.

0:29:31.640,0:29:40.260
It is the supernatural that takes us to places with peace of heart.

0:29:40.260,0:29:45.640
That is why it is possible in the world today to be the best in your career.

0:29:45.640,0:29:50.840
Are you a footballer? The best footballer in the world?

0:29:50.840,0:29:54.000
Whatever you are doing -

0:29:54.000,0:29:58.220
speaking skills, ability to inspire - you can be the best in the world

0:29:58.220,0:30:02.140
and yet not believe in God.

0:30:02.140,0:30:12.760
You can do all this without God because all this can be achieved by human natural gift.

0:30:12.760,0:30:19.960
How you process your documents will determine the outcome.

0:30:19.960,0:30:26.240
Cherish processing more than the result.

0:30:26.240,0:30:31.420
Somebody may sit an exam for you, and you may not be the one that sits for it.

0:30:31.420,0:30:35.880
Somebody will do it for you and you come out first class.

0:30:35.880,0:30:37.560
Processing!

0:30:37.560,0:30:40.160
You are not the one that did the exam.

0:30:40.160,0:30:45.140
You carry the certificate; somebody has done it for you.

0:30:45.140,0:30:46.960
That is wrong processing.

0:30:46.960,0:30:52.280
Processing is better, greater than the result.

0:30:52.280,0:30:54.740
These are the challenges we are facing today.

0:30:54.740,0:31:02.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:02.860,0:31:06.300
You say you are a Christian.

0:31:06.300,0:31:08.800
Christianity has a process.

0:31:08.800,0:31:14.000
If all this processing is not right, and you say you are a Christian,

0:31:14.000,0:31:20.580
you will confess Christianity but you will not live the life of a Christian.

0:31:20.580,0:31:26.620
What is the life of a Christian?

0:31:26.620,0:31:30.900
To be a Christian is to be content.

0:31:30.900,0:31:33.360
That is number one.

0:31:33.360,0:31:38.480
The moment you know you are not content, agree with me that you are not a Christian.

0:31:38.480,0:31:40.940
Contentment !

0:31:40.940,0:31:44.960
Whatever anybody becomes, that will not bother you.

0:31:44.960,0:31:49.360
Whether you have little or you don't eat, you will be content.

0:31:49.360,0:31:53.520
Whether you have little money or you don't have money to go there and everybody wants to go there,

0:31:53.520,0:31:55.440
you will be content.

0:31:55.440,0:32:01.320
Contentment is the processing of a Christian.

0:32:01.320,0:32:03.540
It is not how much wrong you experience.

0:32:03.540,0:32:06.340
When wrong comes, how do you handle the wrong?

0:32:06.340,0:32:17.780
As a Christian, when you are wrong, your soul and spirit will be disturbed.

0:32:17.780,0:32:21.840
You are not content.

0:32:21.840,0:32:24.520
You always count day by day.

0:32:24.520,0:32:27.360
Tomorrow, I am so and so here,

0:32:27.360,0:32:29.460
I am so and so there, I have not achieved this.

0:32:29.460,0:32:30.840
I am schooling.

0:32:30.840,0:32:33.000
You are always complaining.

0:32:33.000,0:32:36.340
You are not content; you believe you are being cheated.

0:32:36.340,0:32:41.960
You believe that there are witches and wizards that are after you.

0:32:41.960,0:32:47.180
By your prayer - when you are praying, one can know whether you are a Christian or not.

0:32:47.180,0:32:50.580
If I want to know whether this man is a Christian,

0:32:50.580,0:32:57.720
if I call him now to pray, through his prayer I will know whether he is a Christian or not.

0:32:57.720,0:33:01.120
How do we know Christians? - Through prayer.

0:33:01.120,0:33:07.460
A Christian, because he is content, - he may be sick and will say, "Thank You, Jesus!

0:33:07.460,0:33:10.840
I glorify Your holy name, I thank You for today!

0:33:10.840,0:33:15.200
I will continue to thank You for all what you are about to do and all what you have done!

0:33:15.200,0:33:21.060
Thank You!" He will begin to sing, whereas he is sick

0:33:21.060,0:33:24.900
because he has left everything for God.

0:33:24.900,0:33:29.100
He knows that God knows him more than himself.

0:33:29.100,0:33:31.780
But when you are not a Christian, immediately they ask you to pray,

0:33:31.780,0:33:35.780
you say, "God, thank You. I'm sick. Heal me!

0:33:35.780,0:33:37.960
I'm sick. Heal me!

0:33:37.960,0:33:39.300
Please, heal me!

0:33:39.300,0:33:44.260
My brother yesterday was healed, and I am better than my brother.

0:33:44.260,0:33:45.380
Heal me, Lord!

0:33:45.380,0:33:48.260
I have been coming to the church for many years now,

0:33:48.260,0:33:50.860
and this man just came today and he was healed.

0:33:50.860,0:33:53.680
Lord Jesus, don't leave me. Heal me!

0:33:53.680,0:33:57.040
If you don't heal me, I may not come to this church again!"

0:33:57.040,0:34:04.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:04.780,0:34:07.300
And indeed, he will not come again.

0:34:07.300,0:34:10.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:10.880,0:34:14.780
Look at this.

0:34:14.780,0:34:20.180
If the processing of this carrot is wrong, when you taste it, you will know

0:34:20.180,0:34:28.940
whether it was grown using fertiliser, not natural soil.

0:34:28.940,0:34:34.080
Give me the one that is actually grown in natural soil and the one using fertiliser.

0:34:34.080,0:34:36.640
When you taste it, you will know the difference.

0:34:36.640,0:34:41.440
In fact, the one with the fertiliser affects the health.

0:34:41.440,0:34:48.500
The same applies to those chicken, fish you rear, water, everything - processing.

0:34:48.500,0:34:49.940
Let someone say, processing.

0:34:49.940,0:34:51.940
Processing.

0:34:51.940,0:35:01.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:01.960,0:35:09.020
Many of us are here today for the first time and you have forgotten yourself.

0:35:09.020,0:35:15.340
When you think back, you will realise that every hour, you must take your drug.

0:35:15.340,0:35:19.100
If you don't take your tablet, you will have a fit.

0:35:19.100,0:35:25.540
But today, you have been sitting down for the past six hours, and you have forgotten your tablet.

0:35:25.540,0:35:33.300
You have just forgotten yourself and nothing has happened to you.

0:35:33.300,0:35:36.980
Many of us here - if you were not here, you would have gone to the toilet

0:35:36.980,0:35:40.540
up to six to eight times because of diabetes.

0:35:40.540,0:35:45.260
But for the past seven hours now, you have been sitting down - no toilet.

0:35:45.260,0:35:52.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:52.520,0:36:04.100
Because Jesus has taken more of you and given you more of Him.

0:36:04.100,0:36:10.180
What is the meaning of that? It means that you have forgotten yourself.

0:36:10.180,0:36:18.600
When you have forgotten yourself, Jesus takes over.

0:36:18.600,0:36:23.560
When you leave from here now, by the time you just move outside there, you will start remembering yourself,

0:36:23.560,0:36:28.320
"Ah, I have diabetes. I have not taken my drug today".

0:36:28.320,0:36:32.240
The moment you remember - urine - you are pressed.

0:36:32.240,0:36:35.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:35.580,0:36:39.240
If you don't forget yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.

0:36:39.240,0:36:47.200
Tell your neighbour: If you don't forget yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.

0:36:47.200,0:37:02.500
To forget yourself is to forget your challenges, situation, predicaments or worry.

0:37:02.500,0:37:09.280
Tell your neighbour: If you don't forget yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.

0:37:09.280,0:37:16.700
Remembering yourself and following Jesus is serving two masters.

0:37:16.700,0:37:19.660
You are serving two masters.

0:37:19.660,0:37:30.760
You follow Jesus and at the same time, you remember your challenges, trouble or worry.

0:37:30.760,0:37:32.920
You are serving two masters.

0:37:32.920,0:37:40.740
You must forget yourself to follow Jesus.

0:37:40.740,0:37:47.380
An example of forgetting yourself is when you sleep.

0:37:47.380,0:37:54.100
My brother, when you sleep, your sickness sleeps.

0:37:54.100,0:37:57.920
Until when you wake up, you will start feeling the pain.

0:37:57.920,0:38:01.160
When you wake up like this, you will start feeling the pain - "Ah, headache!"

0:38:01.160,0:38:03.840
But when you were sleeping, you couldn't feel that pain.

0:38:03.840,0:38:10.120
This is why scientist decide to give you painkillers.

0:38:10.120,0:38:13.220
When they give you this tablet, you will sleep off.

0:38:13.220,0:38:18.360
At that moment, there is no pain but when you wake up, the pain will start.

0:38:18.360,0:38:20.640
That is an example of forgetting yourself.

0:38:20.640,0:38:27.560
In the same vein, when you forget yourself, you have the ability to follow Jesus

0:38:27.560,0:38:32.360
because with Jesus, there is no worry, anxiety, challenges, nothing.

0:38:32.360,0:38:34.620
No! In Him, there is nothing like that.

0:38:34.620,0:38:40.380
That is why when you are following Jesus, challenges are not there.

0:38:40.380,0:38:44.280
In Him, in Jesus, there are no challenges or worries.

0:38:44.280,0:38:50.040
So it is not possible for you to follow Him with your worry, challenges or situations

0:38:50.040,0:38:52.840
because in Him, there is nothing like that.
