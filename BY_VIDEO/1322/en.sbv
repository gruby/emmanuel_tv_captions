0:00:00.020,0:00:04.880
Good Morning!

0:00:04.880,0:00:11.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:11.880,0:00:14.400
Hallelujah.

0:00:14.400,0:00:17.040
Thank you. Have your seat.

0:00:17.040,0:00:20.060
Hallelujah.

0:00:20.060,0:00:29.540
Let's just dwell on the message we discontinued last Sunday.

0:00:29.540,0:00:37.860
Part 2 this time: Believe And Confess.

0:00:37.860,0:00:50.640
This actually relates to the reality of our daily life.

0:00:50.640,0:00:59.020
Let's take our reading to the Book of Matthew 12.

0:00:59.020,0:01:06.440
I will take my reading from verse 1; back to the proof text.

0:01:06.440,0:01:13.460
"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath.

0:01:13.460,0:01:22.740
His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.

0:01:22.740,0:01:27.360
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him,

0:01:27.360,0:01:35.340
'Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.'"

0:01:35.340,0:01:39.240
Let's go to the proof text.

0:01:39.240,0:01:41.880
34.

0:01:41.880,0:01:52.540
"For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."

0:01:52.540,0:02:02.720
That shows that the word we speak determines the life we enjoy.

0:02:02.720,0:02:12.560
If heart and mouth both get in accord with God's Word,

0:02:12.560,0:02:20.360
it means the word we speak determines the life.

0:02:20.360,0:02:28.660
But if they are not according to the truth of God's Word,

0:02:28.660,0:02:42.340
they will remain idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.

0:02:42.340,0:02:56.100
That is, the heart and mouth both get in accord with God's Word.

0:02:56.100,0:03:03.240
Last week, that Book of Romans 10 from verse 8 was our proof text.

0:03:03.240,0:03:06.100
What are we saying?

0:03:06.100,0:03:18.860
In a nutshell, we are saying, confession is part of salvation just as believing.

0:03:18.860,0:03:27.040
Confession is part of salvation just as believing.

0:03:27.040,0:03:41.780
Be a talking Christian, a reporting Christian, not only a doing one.

0:03:41.780,0:03:47.600
If you believe what you are doing, you will report.

0:03:47.600,0:04:03.580
If you believe what you are doing and hearing, you will report.

0:04:03.580,0:04:09.480
For you to be working and working - you are seeing the wrong around

0:04:09.480,0:04:14.120
and you decide not to say it or report it.

0:04:14.120,0:04:17.860
It means, you don't believe what you are doing.

0:04:17.860,0:04:29.920
Reporting should be an expression of believing

0:04:29.920,0:04:38.740
because if you believe in what you are doing, you will report.

0:04:38.740,0:04:51.700
If you believe in what you hear, you will report.

0:04:51.700,0:04:59.600
When we are expectant and you are given an assignment, "Oh, this is a job for you",

0:04:59.600,0:05:08.140
that job will not lead to success, unless you as well report;

0:05:08.140,0:05:12.440
at the same time you report the evil going on around.

0:05:12.440,0:05:26.600
We are expected to work as well as to report the wrong around

0:05:26.600,0:05:40.800
because when you are working without reporting, you are working in vain.

0:05:40.800,0:05:51.280
Working alone cannot help an establishment to grow.

0:05:51.280,0:06:10.280
Any establishment expects two things from you: working and reporting - for their growth.

0:06:10.280,0:06:13.020
That is why your company does not grow.

0:06:13.020,0:06:21.620
That is why our home is not in order.

0:06:21.620,0:06:35.100
When you report what you see, what you hear, it settles issues, it answers questions,

0:06:35.100,0:06:45.820
it provides a way forward, it clarifies doubt.

0:06:45.820,0:06:58.720
When you report what you see and hear, it settles issues.

0:06:58.720,0:07:13.800
A clear example is seen in Matthew 11:2-5 when John the Baptist sent his disciples

0:07:13.800,0:07:19.480
to clarify the identity of Jesus.

0:07:19.480,0:07:22.220
"Who is the man?"

0:07:22.220,0:07:52.680
And Jesus asked them to go and report to John what they had seen and heard.

0:07:52.680,0:08:08.860
Wherever you find yourself, you have to report what you see, what you hear.

0:08:08.860,0:08:20.640
You have to because work alone cannot help any establishment to grow.

0:08:20.640,0:08:22.880
That is why the companies do not grow.

0:08:22.880,0:08:26.640
You work; you see everyone working and working.

0:08:26.640,0:08:31.560
That cannot help the establishment to grow.

0:08:31.560,0:08:36.280
Establishment expects two things from you.

0:08:36.280,0:08:42.720
Working - everywhere working, working. No!

0:08:42.720,0:08:48.620
Working alone cannot help your family, your company, your ministry.

0:08:48.620,0:08:59.240
This is why Jesus said, go into the world and preach the Gospel.

0:08:59.240,0:09:02.580
What is the purpose of Emmanuel TV?

0:09:02.580,0:09:07.300
If not Emmanuel TV, you people would have clouded me here

0:09:07.300,0:09:14.620
and given me a name that Jesus has not given me.

0:09:14.620,0:09:18.840
You would have changed my name, if not Emmanuel TV.

0:09:18.840,0:09:20.920
That is reporter.

0:09:20.920,0:09:23.980
Say, "Good reporter".

0:09:23.980,0:09:28.340
Emmanuel TV - good reporter.

0:09:28.340,0:09:31.840
You can see everywhere - silent.

0:09:31.840,0:09:35.920
Emmanuel TV silenced them.

0:09:35.920,0:09:41.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:41.420,0:09:50.620
The pharisees and sadducees - this Emmanuel TV has silenced everyone.

0:09:50.620,0:09:56.440
When you are telling people, "This is white", they say, "No, we have seen it is yellow".

0:09:56.440,0:10:03.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:03.720,0:10:07.000
We have the mind of Christ.

0:10:07.000,0:10:12.880
1 Corinthians 2:16.

0:10:12.880,0:10:18.200
Don't be afraid to say you don't know if you don't.

0:10:18.200,0:10:19.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:19.040,0:10:25.520
Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know", if you don't know.

0:10:25.520,0:10:26.600
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:26.600,0:10:31.840
[Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know", if you don't know.]

0:10:31.840,0:10:40.460
Satan hates an independent mind - a mind that will think for itself,

0:10:40.460,0:10:45.160
a mind that is determined to find out the truth from God.

0:10:45.160,0:10:47.840
"No! What you are telling me, I need to pray over it."

0:10:47.840,0:10:49.720
Satan hates that heart.

0:10:49.720,0:10:54.560
"No, what you are telling me... Ok. I need to pray over it.

0:10:54.560,0:10:58.300
I need to know the truth from God." - Satan hates that.

0:10:58.300,0:11:09.320
Satan wants you to take everything you hear and see without questioning.

0:11:09.320,0:11:14.140
Everything - "Oh yes, it's right."

0:11:14.140,0:11:24.800
Satan wants us to take everything we hear and see without questioning.

0:11:24.800,0:11:31.520
That is satan; he hates an independent mind - a mind that will think for itself,

0:11:31.520,0:11:35.380
that will determine to find out the truth from God.

0:11:35.380,0:11:40.220
He hates it; that is satan for you.

0:11:40.220,0:11:44.740
I just want to prepare you for this week you are about to enter.

0:11:44.740,0:11:46.300
That is why I'm here.

0:11:46.300,0:11:55.720
Working and reporting scrutinizes the relationship among us.

0:11:55.720,0:12:01.260
If you know I'm a very good reporter, you will be very careful to come near me.

0:12:01.260,0:12:04.560
"You know this man - I know what you are going to say.

0:12:04.560,0:12:08.520
He will report every wrong thing he sees."

0:12:08.520,0:12:11.320
"Oh, this man!"

0:12:11.320,0:12:16.420
You will talk less; go there and say the truth.

0:12:16.420,0:12:27.120
Working and reporting scrutinizes the relationship among us.

0:12:27.120,0:12:34.940
If you are one that works as well as reports,

0:12:34.940,0:12:41.340
people will be very careful the way and manner they work and relate with you

0:12:41.340,0:12:45.620
because they know you will report anything wrong.

0:12:45.620,0:12:52.920
This will naturally select those who will relate with you.

0:12:52.920,0:12:54.760
Naturally.

0:12:54.760,0:13:03.840
For it is said, "Show me your friends and I will tell you whom you are".

0:13:03.840,0:13:07.320
What you are today is a result of your friends.

0:13:07.320,0:13:13.740
You cannot do it alone; you need good friends, informed and disciplined ones.

0:13:13.740,0:13:16.480
But where will you get these in the town around you?

0:13:16.480,0:13:18.860
Where are they?

0:13:18.860,0:13:25.440
The friends we have around today are dividing, subtracting.

0:13:25.440,0:13:29.840
You know what is happening to you.

0:13:29.840,0:13:32.840
To have the right friend, you have to be a good reporter.

0:13:32.840,0:13:39.760
You have to stand to report every wrong that is going on.

0:13:39.760,0:13:45.880
Let the people know that this man - "Hm... He will report anything around him.

0:13:45.880,0:13:48.960
Anything that is wrong, he will report it."

0:13:48.960,0:13:59.140
That is only saving grace to have a like mind.

0:13:59.140,0:14:05.800
When you want to employ people in your company, that is the first question.

0:14:05.800,0:14:11.680
This - I know you will work, I know you are a hard-working guy.

0:14:11.680,0:14:18.080
But as well, you must report every wrong that is going on.

0:14:18.080,0:14:29.640
If not, you have not worked, you have not done anything right.

0:14:29.640,0:14:38.940
We must work as well as report.

0:14:38.940,0:14:58.440
For example, the way and manner your colleagues behave in an establishment

0:14:58.440,0:15:09.260
must be reported to help the establishment grow.

0:15:09.260,0:15:22.500
Unruly behaviours of other employees must be reported to help the establishment grow

0:15:22.500,0:15:25.740
not just becoming a hard worker.

0:15:25.740,0:15:27.900
The devil can work.

0:15:27.900,0:15:30.500
As we are talking now, the devil is working.

0:15:30.500,0:15:32.980
When you see many of your friends that you love so much,

0:15:32.980,0:15:38.940
later you discover it is the devil - they are very hard-working people.

0:15:38.940,0:15:42.340
But this is what the devil will not do:

0:15:42.340,0:15:47.380
The devil will not come to you and say, "Excuse me, there is a man

0:15:47.380,0:15:50.140
that is in a pool of blood there. He needs help".

0:15:50.140,0:15:54.180
The devil will not say that.

0:15:54.180,0:15:59.860
The devil will not say, "Because you are a smoker, that is why you have this tuberculosis".

0:15:59.860,0:16:04.320
He wants you to smoke more - the devil will not report this.

0:16:04.320,0:16:10.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:10.420,0:16:12.540
So you have been here since morning.

0:16:12.540,0:16:14.940
What report do you have for me?

0:16:14.940,0:16:16.360
That is what we are saying.

0:16:16.360,0:16:21.040
But you want to receive miracle, deliverance, blessing

0:16:21.040,0:16:26.740
and at the end of the day, you do like this... - you are going.

0:16:26.740,0:16:28.740
You have been dancing since morning.

0:16:28.740,0:16:35.280
There are some funny men, funny women that are making noise, disturbing the group,

0:16:35.280,0:16:41.660
playing games on their set, playing games inside the church.

0:16:41.660,0:16:46.820
You see them and you know this is unruly behaviour.

0:16:46.820,0:16:50.920
If you don't report them, you are not here today.

0:16:50.920,0:16:58.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:58.780,0:17:03.900
You know some others, they have been moving from one group to another,

0:17:03.900,0:17:08.280
trying to make connections, sending a paper to groups.

0:17:08.280,0:17:12.240
You don't know what they have written but they keep sending it.

0:17:12.240,0:17:16.880
They are first-class beggars inside the church,

0:17:16.880,0:17:20.320
disturbing others that are here for the salvation of their souls.

0:17:20.320,0:17:22.160
It must be reported.

0:17:22.160,0:17:33.460
If this is in order, the world will be at its best, at peace.

0:17:33.460,0:17:35.820
You have to take this home.

0:17:35.820,0:17:44.940
Reporting should be an expression of believing.

0:17:44.940,0:17:55.200
Because you believe in what you are doing, you report.

0:17:55.200,0:18:04.600
Because you do not believe in what you are doing, you don't report.

0:18:04.600,0:18:07.300
You are here today; you have seen.

0:18:07.300,0:18:17.800
Your duty is to tell the world what you have seen!

0:18:17.800,0:18:19.400
Take time.

0:18:19.400,0:18:21.860
You can even move from one country to another -

0:18:21.860,0:18:25.660
"I just want to share what I have seen." You must be a good giver.

0:18:25.660,0:18:27.400
You are saved to save others.

0:18:27.400,0:18:32.600
You move, you take your time, any time you are back to your country.

0:18:32.600,0:18:35.380
Just take your time; you can fly from one city to another,

0:18:35.380,0:18:40.780
just to share what you have seen today with others.

0:18:40.780,0:18:47.840
Be a good reporter - first to God, then to men.

0:18:47.840,0:18:49.840
Rise up for prayer.

0:18:49.840,0:18:53.240

God's intervention!

0:19:24.320,0:19:27.360
Ask for God's intervention.

0:19:27.360,0:19:36.220
Ask God to intervene in your economics, in your politics.

0:19:36.220,0:19:50.960
God's intervention in the economies of your nations and politics of your nation -

0:19:50.960,0:19:52.440
God's intervention!

0:19:52.440,0:19:59.500
Open your lips!

0:19:59.500,0:20:07.620
Ask God to intervene!

I can't hear you!

I can't hear you!

Thank You, Lord.

0:20:44.660,0:20:48.980
Let us strengthen you for your journey back home.

0:20:48.980,0:20:50.540
Open your lips.

0:20:50.540,0:20:57.900
Ask God to strengthen you in your journey back home -

0:20:57.900,0:21:03.200
journey of righteousness and uprightness.

0:21:03.200,0:21:13.100
Strengthen me, Lord!

0:21:13.100,0:21:21.940
Put in me Your right attitude!

0:21:21.940,0:21:27.000
Put in our hearts Your right attitude!

0:21:27.000,0:21:30.980
Prayer!

Prayer For The Nations
With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:21:52.260,0:22:10.120
I surrender all

0:22:10.120,0:22:29.360
All to Thee my blessed Saviour
I surrender all

0:22:29.360,0:22:32.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:32.200,0:22:35.540
There is need for you to surrender.

0:22:35.540,0:22:48.760
When you reflect on God's mercy to you, His mercy is unlimited.

In Jesus Christ's name we pray!

0:23:55.620,0:23:57.300
I can't hear your "Amen!"

0:23:57.300,0:23:58.940
[Amen!]

0:23:58.940,0:24:00.940
I can't hear your "Amen!"

0:24:00.940,0:24:03.400
[Amen!]

0:24:03.400,0:24:09.040
Don't forget the summary of the message:

0:24:09.040,0:24:21.460
Every establishment, company, ministry expects two things from you -

0:24:21.460,0:24:27.880
work and report.

0:24:27.880,0:24:29.960
You are going now.

0:24:29.960,0:24:34.900
Think of the report you have before you leave.

0:24:34.900,0:24:45.940
You have to look at whatever that is not right -

0:24:45.940,0:24:49.200
you are to report it.

0:24:49.200,0:24:53.920
In your company, everywhere.

0:25:00.900,0:25:12.500
If you are looking for perfection, go to Heaven.

0:25:12.500,0:25:18.200
That is why there is need for report.

0:25:18.200,0:25:26.080
You need to go to Heaven to see perfection.

0:25:26.080,0:25:28.340
Be a good reporter.

0:25:28.340,0:25:29.200
Tell your neighbour.

0:25:29.200,0:25:31.420
[Be a good reporter.]

0:25:31.420,0:25:35.940
First to God, then to men.

0:25:35.940,0:25:36.900
Again.

0:25:36.900,0:25:41.100
[Be a good reporter - first to God, then to men.]

0:25:41.100,0:25:42.140
Again.

0:25:42.140,0:25:46.260
[Be a good reporter - first to God, then to men.]

0:25:46.260,0:25:47.460
Again.

0:25:47.460,0:25:51.580
[Be a good reporter - first to God, then to men.]

0:25:51.580,0:25:53.040
I can't hear you!

0:25:53.040,0:25:57.200
[Be a good reporter - first to God, then to men.]

0:25:57.200,0:26:01.000
Yes, first to God, then to men.

0:26:01.000,0:26:02.300
