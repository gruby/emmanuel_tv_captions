Prophecy Time

0:00:03.640,0:00:07.620
Come here. Where's your husband?

0:00:07.620,0:00:09.240
He is at home.

0:00:09.240,0:00:11.620
- Your husband is at home.
- Yes, sir.

0:00:11.620,0:00:13.480
What is the problem?

0:00:13.480,0:00:16.220
He wants to fight for politics.

0:00:16.220,0:00:18.680
There was a problem, sir, in the family.

0:00:18.680,0:00:23.160
DELIVERANCE TIME

0:00:23.160,0:00:26.980
At The SCOAN Sunday service, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the people,

0:00:26.980,0:00:30.800
separating them from every chain satan used to connect himself.

0:00:30.800,0:00:34.080
Let us hear what the demon inside this lady says.

0:00:34.080,0:00:37.700
Speak out! Who are you inside this body?

0:00:37.700,0:00:38.920
What have you done to her career?

0:00:38.920,0:00:43.700
I destroyed everything.

0:00:43.700,0:00:45.020
What have you done to her marriage?

0:00:45.020,0:00:48.240
I destroyed the marriage. They will not have peace.

0:00:48.240,0:00:49.420
She is my queen.

0:00:49.420,0:00:51.700
She is your queen. Who are you?

0:00:51.700,0:00:54.060
How do you manifest as a queen in her life?

0:00:54.060,0:00:55.940
How do you operate in her life?

0:00:55.940,0:00:57.580
I made her suffer.

0:00:57.580,0:00:58.820
How did you make her suffer?

0:00:58.820,0:01:01.460
I destroyed her career.

0:01:01.460,0:01:03.400
Before any competition, what did you do to her?

0:01:03.400,0:01:05.700
I gave her pain.

0:01:05.700,0:01:06.820
Why did you give her pain?

0:01:06.820,0:01:09.060
I gave her injuries.

0:01:09.060,0:01:13.820
You gave her injuries for what? Why did you give her injuries?

0:01:13.820,0:01:15.540
I just want her to suffer.

0:01:15.540,0:01:17.840
You want her to suffer?

0:01:17.840,0:01:18.660
Yes.

0:01:18.660,0:01:20.080
How did you enter this body?

0:01:20.080,0:01:22.360
Through friends.

0:01:22.360,0:01:25.960
The prayer of faith sets her free, in Jesus' name.

0:01:25.960,0:01:28.540
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:01:28.540,0:01:30.680
Thank You, Jesus, I'm delivered!

0:01:30.680,0:01:32.800
Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:32.800,0:01:41.200
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:01:41.200,0:01:44.600
Praise God, people of God!

0:01:44.600,0:01:48.360
My name is Mercy Cherono. We are from Kenya.

0:01:48.360,0:01:52.880
I am an athlete running 5000 meters and 1500 meters.

0:01:52.880,0:01:56.640
I have represented my country in many championships.

0:01:56.640,0:02:01.140
I was even last year in the Olympic games; I was fourth.

0:02:01.140,0:02:03.460
The man beside me is my husband.

0:02:03.460,0:02:06.540
Last week, I was here in the church.

0:02:06.540,0:02:10.120
I came here for my career breakthrough.

0:02:10.120,0:02:14.380
My husband advised me that I should come here for my career breakthrough

0:02:14.380,0:02:18.300
because I was having problems in my career.

0:02:18.300,0:02:20.180
That's why I came here.

0:02:20.180,0:02:23.300
I was surprised when the man of God came to me

0:02:23.300,0:02:28.680
and prophesied to me that where my husband was and what the problem was.

0:02:28.680,0:02:32.080
I thank God because the man of God prayed for me

0:02:32.080,0:02:42.140
and delivered me from the spirit that was giving me the setbacks in my career and marriage.

0:02:42.140,0:02:46.000
Madam, can you just tell us - the man of God in that prophecy mentioned

0:02:46.000,0:02:48.760
about your husband and asked about the trouble in the marriage.

0:02:48.760,0:02:51.640
Can you just explain to us more about that prophecy?

0:02:51.640,0:02:54.720
How that prophecy is true?

0:02:54.720,0:03:04.980
The prophecy was very true because we have been married for four months now

0:03:04.980,0:03:09.280
and before we got married, we had a lot of challenges.

0:03:09.280,0:03:16.040
After we got married, whenever we had a small issue, it would just become so big

0:03:16.040,0:03:21.360
and we could even stop talking for one or two days in the house.

0:03:21.360,0:03:25.060
So there was a lot of anger.

0:03:25.060,0:03:27.740
So even though as a young marriage just four months,

0:03:27.740,0:03:31.280
already you were having a lot of fights and quarrels in the home.

0:03:31.280,0:03:34.220
Yes, there was a lot of anger in the house.

0:03:34.220,0:03:40.400
Even a small problem, it would even be bigger; we could even stop talking.

0:03:40.400,0:03:44.280
You mentioned that even before you got married, there were some issues that you had.

0:03:44.280,0:03:50.520
Can you tell us - what was the major problem, even before you finally got married to your husband?

0:03:50.520,0:03:57.260
Before we got married, there were some controversial issues in the family.

0:03:57.260,0:04:01.540
We were almost married, and there were a lot of controversial issues.

0:04:01.540,0:04:06.120
We thank God we got married and are here now.

0:04:06.120,0:04:10.040
So we're listening to what our sister is saying that this is just a very young marriage

0:04:10.040,0:04:15.000
just four months but before the marriage, there were a lot of controversies in the family

0:04:15.000,0:04:20.440
concerning the marriage and even after marriage, there has been a lot of turmoil in the house, fighting.

0:04:20.440,0:04:29.600
The controversy in the family was because there was another woman who has a child for him.

0:04:29.600,0:04:32.700
It was very hard for me.

0:04:32.700,0:04:37.840
Okay, so before marriage, your husband had a child with another lady.

0:04:37.840,0:04:42.300
Do you mean to say that that lady was trying to cause some challenges between you

0:04:42.300,0:04:44.060
and your getting married to him?

0:04:44.060,0:04:46.620
Yes, we were about to get married.

0:04:46.620,0:04:51.820
She was disturbing with a lot of calls.

0:04:51.820,0:04:55.420
So we can understand the reason why the man of God gave this prophecy

0:04:55.420,0:04:58.220
about the troubles in this young marriage but we give glory to God

0:04:58.220,0:05:02.100
that our sister is here with her husband today in The SCOAN.

0:05:02.100,0:05:08.040
Madam, we saw in the clip how during the deliverance, the evil spirit mentioned

0:05:08.040,0:05:11.600
about how it really affected your career negatively.

0:05:11.600,0:05:15.300
Can you just describe more about the problems you are facing in your career

0:05:15.300,0:05:18.900
as an Olympic athlete before you came to the church.

0:05:18.900,0:05:23.960
Before I came to the church, my husband told me that I should come here

0:05:23.960,0:05:26.680
to The SCOAN for my deliverance in my career

0:05:26.680,0:05:35.900
because whenever I was training so well, preparing for any championship,

0:05:35.900,0:05:42.100
when I was almost at the championship, I would develop an injury.

0:05:42.100,0:05:49.140
I used to take even strong pain killers to sustain me, to run the event.

0:05:49.140,0:05:55.660
But after the competition, the pain would become worse than before.

0:05:55.660,0:06:02.560
I would stop and nurse the injury.

0:06:02.560,0:06:05.560
Can you give us an example of this?

0:06:05.560,0:06:10.880
Maybe in your last major championship at the Olympic games, tell us what happened.

0:06:10.880,0:06:15.640
Even last year before the Olympic games, I developed a stress fracture

0:06:15.640,0:06:17.920
but I didn't know it was a stress fracture.

0:06:17.920,0:06:23.640
I would take strong pain killers to sustain me, train and run.

0:06:23.640,0:06:27.120
I never told anyone, not even my cousin.

0:06:27.120,0:06:33.560
I was thinking, maybe if I said I had pain, I would be removed from the team.

0:06:33.560,0:06:37.220
After that, I was running with that pain.

0:06:37.220,0:06:42.460
I could not do as I was supposed to do with my capability.

0:06:42.460,0:06:47.940
After the championship, I was taken for treatment in Italy.

0:06:47.940,0:06:50.180
It has been like three years now.

0:06:50.180,0:06:54.540
Every time it got close to a championship, I would develop an injury.

0:06:54.540,0:06:58.680
We understand what our sister is saying that even in the recent Olympic games

0:06:58.680,0:07:04.100
that were held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, our sister was competing in serious pain

0:07:04.100,0:07:08.520
because just before the competition, she developed a stress fracture.

0:07:08.520,0:07:12.120
She said that any time she was training, she was doing very well

0:07:12.120,0:07:16.080
But when the competition approached, the world championships approached,

0:07:16.080,0:07:18.980
that was when an injury would come that would limit her

0:07:18.980,0:07:22.100
from performing to her full capabilities in the event.

0:07:22.100,0:07:25.940
So you mean to say, madam, during the Olympic games you were running with that pain

0:07:25.940,0:07:28.940
and that was the reason that you were unable to make it to the medal table,

0:07:28.940,0:07:31.500
you only came out in fourth position. Is that right?

0:07:31.500,0:07:39.840
Yes, that made me to be in the fourth position because I could not do as I was supposed to.

0:07:39.840,0:07:45.860
We saw earlier in that clip how that evil spirit that was plagueing our sister's life actually said

0:07:45.860,0:07:51.040
that it caused these injuries and that pain that really affected her negatively

0:07:51.040,0:07:53.060
before her coming to The SCOAN.

0:07:53.060,0:07:56.220
Sister, we thank God that you came and just tell us to the glory of God,

0:07:56.220,0:07:59.520
ever since the deliverance and the prophecy last week,

0:07:59.520,0:08:02.600
what are the changes that you have seen in your life?

0:08:02.600,0:08:11.580
Ever since I came here, after the deliverance, I've been feeling light.

0:08:11.580,0:08:15.720
Everything is going on well.

0:08:15.720,0:08:18.360
Hallelujah. Your husband is now with you here

0:08:18.360,0:08:22.680
What can you say about the changes in your relationship with him after that prophecy?

0:08:22.680,0:08:28.220
After the prophecy, the man of God invited my husband, that he should come.

0:08:28.220,0:08:34.100
Everything has changed like we have just started a relationship.

0:08:34.100,0:08:38.700
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:08:38.700,0:08:42.860
Sister, you mentioned that you had this severe injury in your foot

0:08:42.860,0:08:43.780
that hindered your running.

0:08:43.780,0:08:46.580
Does it mean that even when you were in the church last week,

0:08:46.580,0:08:48.600
you were still having that pain?

0:08:48.600,0:08:54.100
Yes, when I came here, I was still feeling a little pain but now, I don't feel it anymore.

0:08:54.100,0:08:57.400
After the prayer you mean the pain has gone completely?

0:08:57.400,0:08:59.140
Yes, I don't feel it anymore.

0:08:59.140,0:09:03.580
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.

0:09:03.580,0:09:05.740
We give all the glory to God Almighty.

0:09:05.740,0:09:08.240
Sister, we can see a couple of pictures on the board.

0:09:08.240,0:09:13.020
Could you just show us what we're seeing on the board here to the glory of God.

0:09:13.020,0:09:16.000
The pictures here on the board:

0:09:16.000,0:09:24.260
The first photo was in the USA.

0:09:24.260,0:09:29.480
This was at the world championships in 2013 in Moscow; I got a silver medal.

0:09:29.480,0:09:35.500
This was at the last year's Olympic games in Rio; I was fourth.

0:09:35.500,0:09:40.880
We thank God that our sister has received a complete deliverance from those spirits

0:09:40.880,0:09:44.860
that were hindering her from reaching her full potential as an Olympic athlete

0:09:44.860,0:09:47.580
representing Kenya for so many years.

0:09:47.580,0:09:49.680
And we thank God that not only deliverance has come

0:09:49.680,0:09:54.780
but peace has been restored to her young marriage as well after that word of prophecy.

0:09:54.780,0:09:58.560
At this point, we want to hear a word from your husband as well.

0:09:58.560,0:10:00.160
Praise God, Church!

0:10:00.160,0:10:03.280
My name is Edmond; I'm from Kenya.

0:10:03.280,0:10:08.380
I am here because the man of God invited me that I should come here for deliverance.

0:10:08.380,0:10:13.200
Only last week, when I was watching Emmanuel TV,

0:10:13.200,0:10:18.160
that was the time when the man of God asked my wife where her husband was.

0:10:18.160,0:10:22.420
Thereafter, I planned to come here for deliverance.

0:10:22.420,0:10:25.760
Glory be to God. So you mean the lady beside you - who is she to you?

0:10:25.760,0:10:26.860
She's my wife.

0:10:26.860,0:10:31.720
Ok, sir. After hearing that word of prophecy, what can you say about the challenges

0:10:31.720,0:10:35.620
that you faced in your marriage for the last number of months?

0:10:35.620,0:10:37.940
Okay, I must say that we have been having challenges.

0:10:37.940,0:10:40.660
We have only been married for four months.

0:10:40.660,0:10:47.820
We would quarrel or have a misunderstanding over small issues.

0:10:47.820,0:10:52.420
Two weeks ago, I asked her that she should come here for deliverance.

0:10:52.420,0:10:57.300
Okay, sir. Can you just give us an example of maybe one of the challenges

0:10:57.300,0:11:02.100
that you faced with your marriage that really caused that anger to come.

0:11:02.100,0:11:03.960
Just give us an example.

0:11:03.960,0:11:09.560
Okay, an example is that: I'm a politician as well as a businessman in Kenya

0:11:09.560,0:11:13.680
and at times we would receive many visitors at our home

0:11:13.680,0:11:18.700
and in many occasions, she wouldn't be happy when we received visitors.

0:11:18.700,0:11:23.360
We would end up not talking for even two or three days.

0:11:23.360,0:11:28.360
So when that anger came upon you, what happened?

0:11:28.360,0:11:34.140
When that anger came into me, I would go silent for two or three days without talking to her.

0:11:34.140,0:11:38.440
We thank God that our brother responded to the invitation of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:11:38.440,0:11:43.220
to be here today and sir, ever since you came to The SCOAN,

0:11:43.220,0:11:46.740
and you've been with your wife, what are the changes that you have witnessed in her?

0:11:46.740,0:11:49.640
There have been a lot of changes since I came here last Friday.

0:11:49.640,0:11:51.500
When I met her, she was happy.

0:11:51.500,0:11:55.660
She talks to me more than she used to talk to me.

0:11:55.660,0:12:00.080
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:00.080,0:12:05.060
We give glory to God Almighty and we thank God for our brother's coming to The SCOAN

0:12:05.060,0:12:09.900
and the wonderful reconciliation that is taking place through that word of prophecy

0:12:09.900,0:12:11.840
and the deliverance that happened last weekend.

0:12:11.840,0:12:16.180
Sir, you are holding an object. Can you just explain to us what you are holding here.

0:12:16.180,0:12:17.820
As I said, I'm a politician.

0:12:17.820,0:12:23.900
What I'm holding in my hand is a symbol of leadership and peace in our country.

0:12:23.900,0:12:28.600
I'm vying for the member of County Assembly in our country.

0:12:28.600,0:12:35.120
We thank God that indeed, our brother has come to seek the face of God concerning political aspirations.

0:12:35.120,0:12:39.800
We give glory to God that the two of them are here today in The SCOAN.

0:12:39.800,0:12:43.600
Sir, we would like to ask you: What is your own word of advice

0:12:43.600,0:12:46.780
to our viewers all over the world, especially to married couples

0:12:46.780,0:12:50.340
that may be facing one or two problems in their marital homes?

0:12:50.340,0:12:54.240
My advice to young families out there is that:

0:12:54.240,0:12:59.540
My wife came here last week for deliverance and I am also here for the same deliverance.

0:12:59.540,0:13:03.980
The small misunderstanding you could be having in your family

0:13:03.980,0:13:05.960
could be that there is a spirit behind it

0:13:05.960,0:13:10.400
and I advise you that you should also seek deliverance for your families.

0:13:10.400,0:13:14.380
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:14.380,0:13:18.680
We have listened to our brother that oftentimes married couples face challenges

0:13:18.680,0:13:22.100
and because God is not involved, sometimes those challenges,

disagreements can even lead to separation, can lead to divorce,

0:13:25.360,0:13:30.620

So our brother is simply advising that we should seek the face of God

0:13:33.940,0:13:38.040
and realise that oftentimes, there are some spirits involved that are not from God

0:13:38.040,0:13:42.260
and deliverance is required for peace to be properly restored to the home.
