Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.960,0:00:06.460
My name is Harrison.

0:00:06.460,0:00:09.380
I'm 40 years old.

0:00:09.380,0:00:17.240
I was among the 126 deportees last week from Libya.

0:00:17.240,0:00:22.840
We wanted to cross the mediterranean sea to Italy.

0:00:22.840,0:00:28.040
God saved me as I was not supposed to go home free.

0:00:28.040,0:00:32.420
I am supposed to come to His altar and thank Him very much.

0:00:32.420,0:00:37.560
It would be very bad for me to go home without thanking God.

0:00:37.560,0:00:40.620
So, I decided to thank God in this church.

0:00:40.620,0:00:45.960
We were 126 deportees last week.

0:00:45.960,0:00:54.580
The last two weeks and upper last week was almost 600 thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:00:54.580,0:01:00.640
They gave us 7 million naira and two bags of rice each.

0:01:00.640,0:01:03.120
A big thanks to Pastor.

0:01:03.120,0:01:06.640
Mr Harrison
Libya Deportee Sharing Life Experience

0:01:06.640,0:01:16.980
The experience I had there - what my eyes have seen, I cannot put it into words.

0:01:16.980,0:01:30.900
I was working as a dock worker at Ibru Jetty where they have between 18 and 20 oil companies.

0:01:30.900,0:01:45.680
After some of the dock workers were registered as staff and I was not, I had to think of a way forward.

0:01:45.680,0:01:51.480
That was how I took the decision to go to Italy through Libya.

0:01:51.480,0:02:01.840
On our journey from Liby to Italy, we were almost 142 passengers who travelled

0:02:01.840,0:02:09.000
through the mediterranean sea in an inflatable boat.

0:02:09.000,0:02:15.100
When we were about to embark on the journey, it was discovered that the boat was leaking

0:02:15.100,0:02:17.360
and we decided to turn back.

0:02:17.360,0:02:23.860
They wanted to go again but 30 minutes into the journey,

0:02:23.860,0:02:28.140
it was discovered that there was not enough fuel, so we came back again.

0:02:28.140,0:02:35.000
My mind was telling me not to go.

0:02:35.000,0:02:39.280
I wanted to go back but I decided that as a man, I would take courage and go,

0:02:39.280,0:02:43.020
instead of staying in my country.

0:02:43.020,0:02:46.020
I was forced to embark on that journey.

0:02:46.020,0:02:57.080
The third time, when we passed Tunis, we got to another country before getting to Italy.

0:02:57.080,0:03:05.520
On getting to Malta, the boat started leaking again. People started screaming,

0:03:05.520,0:03:13.160
especially the girls among us. We were warned not to stand up and were told to squat.

0:03:13.160,0:03:18.760
Out of fear, the girls started standing on their feet, causing the boat to sink.

0:03:18.760,0:03:21.760
People were falling into the water, dying.

0:03:21.760,0:03:27.080
We were even seeing many whose boat had already capsized.

0:03:27.080,0:03:31.680
We were not even thinking about them; we were thinking about how to save our own lives.

0:03:31.680,0:03:35.380
There was a woman and a man who had a newborn baby there.

0:03:35.380,0:03:41.540
They held the baby up in their hands as the boat was sinking.

0:03:41.540,0:03:44.580
I was even thinking of what I could do -

0:03:44.580,0:03:55.680
turn by turn I would die so let me pray and ask God for forgiveness in case I died.

0:03:55.680,0:04:03.040
I was even looking at the woman; she held the baby in her hands but she sank with her husband.

0:04:03.040,0:04:10.960
I was running to the other side that was not in the water but unfortunately,

0:04:10.960,0:04:16.280
their boat sank on the other side and both of them died.

0:04:16.280,0:04:24.640
When the boat went down, I held onto a jerry can that had been full of fuel but was then empty.

0:04:24.640,0:04:29.180
The man who was controlling the boat held onto another jerry can.

0:04:29.180,0:04:40.100
I had a little experience of diving work when I was in Ibru Jetty, so I held the jerry can to my stomach.

0:04:40.100,0:04:51.240
Then, some criminals pulled their boat alongside ours

0:04:51.240,0:04:57.480
and started using their sticks on people who were trying to rescue themselves.

0:04:57.480,0:05:03.580
They struck people with their sticks to make them sink into the water.

0:05:03.580,0:05:12.620
They found three of us who were capable to make a move and took us into their boats.

0:05:12.620,0:05:17.560
They used their guns to hit our heads.

0:05:17.560,0:05:37.100
That is where I got this very big wound here; it tore, blood started coming out and I was unconscious.

0:05:37.100,0:05:43.900
When I opened my eyes in the night, I found myself in an underground prison.

0:05:43.900,0:05:50.780
We were three - myself, the captain of the boat and another boy; we were in the prison.

0:05:50.780,0:05:55.480
I thought we were in a hospital but we were in a prison.

0:05:55.480,0:06:04.700
It was as if we were watching a film.

0:06:04.700,0:06:10.060
They threw us inside an underground cell and closed the door.

0:06:10.060,0:06:13.420
When they closed it, the place was dark. We could not see anybody.

0:06:13.420,0:06:23.400
When they served us food, they would give us a thin slice of bread, half the size of my hand.

0:06:23.400,0:06:30.140
They would give us one slice of bread with a tiny amount of butter to eat.

0:06:30.140,0:06:32.500
In the afternoon, they would not give us any food.

0:06:32.500,0:06:39.880
In the evening, they would give us one particular type of food.

0:06:39.880,0:06:45.480
Most of my friends will be shouting now, "Ah, thank God that this boy is even giving his testimony

0:06:45.480,0:06:47.260
of what he experienced!"

0:06:47.260,0:06:49.420
They would bring a particular type of food.

0:06:49.420,0:07:01.080
It was just as if when one cooks beans in a pot and pours soap and water inside to wash them -

0:07:01.080,0:07:07.240
the mixture of water and soap was how the water which they served us at night looked like.

0:07:07.240,0:07:10.180
They would bring that together with a piece of bread.

0:07:10.180,0:07:14.240
That was the food we would eat 'til the following day.

0:07:14.240,0:07:19.960
After three days, inside our dark prison cell, when they had opened the door, trying to give us food,

0:07:19.960,0:07:28.160
we discovered that one of us was already dead.

0:07:28.160,0:07:48.840
We shouted in their language that someone had died in our midst.

0:07:48.840,0:08:13.120
After telling them that somebody had died, we were beaten with concrete pipes.

0:08:13.120,0:08:19.500
They would use that to flog us every day after bringing us out.

0:08:19.500,0:08:24.600
Whenever they wanted to feed us, they would throw us outside in the sun

0:08:24.600,0:08:27.800
and ask us to face its direction after eating.

0:08:27.800,0:08:41.200
They later took us to another location where we met not less than 10,000 Nigerians.

0:08:41.200,0:08:46.340
We were placed in different prisons. People were crying.

0:08:46.340,0:08:59.060
The worst treatment they gave to Nigerians was deceiving them that they had jobs for them in Italy.

0:08:59.060,0:09:10.140
After collecting some money from them, on getting to Benghazi or Tripoli,

0:09:10.140,0:09:15.960
they would stop the vehicle and ask those whose money was not complete to step down

0:09:15.960,0:09:20.000
before they were moved into three rooms.

0:09:20.000,0:09:28.460
Those three rooms which had only two ceilings harboured over 60 Nigerians.

0:09:28.460,0:09:30.460
There was no air or ventilation.

0:09:30.460,0:09:39.800
Men are strong but some of the women would have died before daybreak.

0:09:39.800,0:09:50.600
We would be escorted with guns to go and throw away their corpses in the desert.

0:09:50.600,0:10:00.240
We would dig shallow graves, put them inside and use our legs to cover the sand over them and go.

0:10:00.240,0:10:05.760
That day, I was even hungry, looking for food to eat.

0:10:05.760,0:10:22.800
I went to a place in Tripoli where we usually went in search for jobs.

0:10:22.800,0:10:36.340
My main aim for going to that place was to get a job so that I could get something to eat.

0:10:36.340,0:10:43.560
We were two in number - myself and a friend called Eze.

0:10:43.560,0:10:55.400
As we were looking for a job, a car parked beside us and the driver asked us to enter.

0:10:55.400,0:11:02.620
After we had entered the car, the driver brought out a gun and threatened to kill us if we talked.

0:11:02.620,0:11:04.780
We cooperated with him.

0:11:04.780,0:11:15.680
Then, he took us to a seaside and upon getting there, we found 52 dead bodies on the shore.

0:11:15.680,0:11:28.060
We were asked to load the 52 dead bodies into a truck.

0:11:28.060,0:11:33.420
By then, I was hungry and had no strength to even lift one of the dead bodies,

0:11:33.420,0:11:38.640
most of which were mutilated.

0:11:38.640,0:11:46.800
The clothes I wore that day were the ones I had worn for almost one year without changing.

0:11:46.800,0:11:53.460
I didn't even have enought money to eat, much less to buy clothes to change into.

0:11:53.460,0:11:59.260
Imagine a situation where someone would just call you to come and help him pump his tyres,

0:11:59.260,0:12:10.080
only for him to bring out a gun when you bend down to do so, shoot you and then drive off.

0:12:10.080,0:12:18.600
Some of them would ask me to come and help them start their generators

0:12:18.600,0:12:25.780
but before entering their house, they would hide all their female children and wives.

0:12:25.780,0:12:28.760
They would lock them inside a room.

0:12:28.760,0:12:31.620
Anything that made one see their wives,

0:12:31.620,0:12:34.340
they would make sure that the person did not come out alive.

0:12:34.340,0:12:40.120
Blacks don't see their wives with the naked eye.

0:12:40.120,0:12:49.520
In the market, the men normally sell okra, tomatoes and seasoning - that is man's work there.

0:12:49.520,0:12:51.360
Let me continue with my story.

0:12:51.360,0:12:55.140
So, they said we should pack the dead bodies - 52 dead bodies.

0:12:55.140,0:12:56.940
I was then weak - no food.

0:12:56.940,0:13:00.360
Now, I am even strong.

0:13:00.360,0:13:03.420
We were even looking for food when they told us to pack the dead bodies.

0:13:03.420,0:13:08.880
We were whipped and told to load the dead bodies into the truck. So we started to pack them.

0:13:08.880,0:13:10.540
52 dead bodies.

0:13:10.540,0:13:19.560
We offloaded the 52 dead bodies in the truck and took them to the desert where we buried them

0:13:19.560,0:13:24.780
in shallow graves - three bodies in one grave.

0:13:24.780,0:13:29.480
After burying the entire dead bodies, do you know what they gave us as compensation?

0:13:29.480,0:13:40.200
We were compensated with a piece of bread and a small portion of maccaroni.

0:13:40.200,0:13:44.860
They would force us to eat it and afterwards, ask us if it tasted nice.

0:13:44.860,0:13:57.340
We would have to agree that it tasted nice, otherwise, they would beat us to death.

0:13:57.340,0:14:02.520
They would pack us back into the vehicle, drop us off at the place they picked us from

0:14:02.520,0:14:05.600
and kick us out of the vehicle.

0:14:05.600,0:14:12.020
I could not even tell my story to anbody there. My whole body would smell of dead bodies.

0:14:12.020,0:14:17.140
When I would enter that place I stayed, there was no water to bath and nothing to use.

0:14:17.140,0:14:24.100
Before I could buy water, I would have to pass through another compound to fetch the water.

0:14:24.100,0:14:33.560
If I decided to narrate the whole ordeal I pass through in Liby, no one would go home today.

0:14:33.560,0:14:37.620
Ok, we know you have a lot of experiences to share with the people of God.

0:14:37.620,0:14:43.860
Because of time, we will just go straight to how you finally got back to Nigeria.

0:14:43.860,0:14:53.860
By the grace of God, I dreamt about Prophet T.B. Joshua that I came to this church

0:14:53.860,0:14:57.700
and he poured water on me.

0:14:57.700,0:15:02.120
When I woke up, I told my friends that I dreamt about Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:15:02.120,0:15:08.020
In the prison there, we were almost 10,000 Nigerians

0:15:08.020,0:15:14.620
and even as we were leaving, we left about 7,000 there.

0:15:14.620,0:15:17.680
People are still there suffering.

0:15:17.680,0:15:21.360
I told my friend that I had dreamt of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:15:21.360,0:15:27.980
He replied excitedly that we would still go back home by the grace of God.

0:15:27.980,0:15:35.000
Fortunately for us, the next day, we heard that the UN started compiling the list of prisoners.

0:15:35.000,0:15:39.160
We started jubilating saying, "We are going home!"

0:15:39.160,0:15:46.740
Ten days later, we were moved to Tripoli in preparation for going home.

0:15:46.740,0:15:53.340
As I speak, many people in the Libyan prisons are wishing to come to The SCOAN

0:15:53.340,0:15:56.560
and give testimony about their experiences.

0:15:56.560,0:16:03.780
When we came here, T.B. Joshua compensated us with the sum of 7 million naira

0:16:03.780,0:16:07.280
and two bags of rice each. We thank God for that.

0:16:07.280,0:16:12.320
So, on coming back home...

0:16:12.320,0:16:14.100
The man of God said we should go back to our homes.

0:16:14.100,0:16:21.720
Unfortunately for me, when I got home, I became so sad as the only child I had

0:16:21.720,0:16:27.900
and was hoping to come home and meet (a boy), had died.

0:16:27.900,0:16:32.340
I had no home to stay, no house - nothing.

0:16:32.340,0:16:39.180
My wife even got married to another person because everybody thought that I was dead.

0:16:39.180,0:16:40.760
Even when I got to my compound,

0:16:40.760,0:16:46.080
some people picked up sand and threw it at me to confirm if I was truly alive.

0:16:46.080,0:16:50.300
I then told them that I was not dead, that I had spent five years in Libya,

0:16:50.300,0:16:55.280
three of which I spent in an underground prison without ever coming out.

0:16:55.280,0:16:58.840
When I came back, people started throwing sand at my body.

0:16:58.840,0:17:00.540
I told them that instead of allowing them to pour sand on me,

0:17:00.540,0:17:03.500
I would hug them to let them know that I was not a spirit.

0:17:03.500,0:17:09.280
As for my wife, she could not wait for many any longer because she thought that I was dead,

0:17:09.280,0:17:11.280
likewise others.

0:17:11.280,0:17:14.280
She told me she had gotten married to another man.

0:17:14.280,0:17:22.120
When I enquired about my son, she told me that he had already died one or two years ago.

0:17:22.120,0:17:29.180
I came back to The SCOAN to share my feelings with the man of God.

0:17:29.180,0:17:36.760
This is my friend. We are staying in the same compound.

0:17:36.760,0:17:41.880
I don't have anything bad in mind.

0:17:41.880,0:17:47.480
I just want everybody to know that I have forgiven my wife and everybody.

0:17:47.480,0:17:56.120
The only thing that is my joy is that I came out to see a free world. I can turn around, I can look,

0:17:56.120,0:18:01.660
I can run, I can buy any food I want to eat. I thank God for everything.

0:18:01.660,0:18:03.100
This is my friend.

0:18:03.100,0:18:14.920
This is my friend that got married to my wife.

0:18:14.920,0:18:19.220
Look at the screen of your television. This was exactly last week

0:18:19.220,0:18:24.320
when they came in their numbers - about 126 of them. They were deported from Libya.

0:18:24.320,0:18:28.800
He was among those that were deported. They made their way to The SCOAN right from the airport.

0:18:28.800,0:18:31.520
When they arrived at The SCOAN premises,

0:18:31.520,0:18:33.780
the man of God was moved with compassion and mercy,

0:18:33.780,0:18:36.180
in conjunction with Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world,

0:18:36.180,0:18:42.780
and they were all blessed with the cash sum of 7 million naira and two bags of rice for each person.

0:18:42.780,0:18:48.080
They were strictly advised to go back to their various homes and visit their family members

0:18:48.080,0:18:50.400
because their family members were expecting them back home.

0:18:50.400,0:18:52.680
We can see them when they came to The SCOAN -

0:18:52.680,0:18:56.320
helplessly because they were deported with nothing; they were frustrated.

0:18:56.320,0:18:59.480
When they came, they were helped at The SCOAN.

0:18:59.480,0:19:04.220
After they were blessed with the sum of 7 million naira and two bags of rice for each person,

0:19:04.220,0:19:07.520
they were advised to go back home and pay their family members a visit.

0:19:07.520,0:19:10.000
That was how he went back to his residence, where he was living,

0:19:10.000,0:19:13.980
the very home he left when he travelled to Libya five years ago.

0:19:13.980,0:19:17.000
But unfortunately for him, the wife made him to understand that

0:19:17.000,0:19:20.920
they thought he was dead because the news that came to her was that the husband was dead.

0:19:20.920,0:19:24.820
And unfortunately for him, the very son he left behind was already dead.

0:19:24.820,0:19:28.780
So the wife had no choice but to get married to the very friend he loves so much.

0:19:28.780,0:19:31.820
And that is the friend that is standing by him right now.

0:19:31.820,0:19:34.100
As you can see on the screen of your television,

0:19:34.100,0:19:37.480
the very brother who shared his experience a moment ago

0:19:37.480,0:19:43.540
was among the 126 Libyan deportees that visited The SCOAN last week.

0:19:43.540,0:19:47.160
They were blessed with the sum of 7 million, as you can see them there.

0:19:47.160,0:19:52.060
They were so excited that they were blessed with 7 million and two bags of rice each.

0:19:52.060,0:19:56.000
They were advised to go back home and visit their family members.

0:19:56.000,0:19:57.700
We also want to bring it to your hearing

0:19:57.700,0:20:01.120
that this very group has not been the only group that had been coming.

0:20:01.120,0:20:04.760
Ever since this year, they have been turning up in their numbers.

0:20:04.760,0:20:14.400
The moment they are deported, they find their way to The SCOAN for refuge.

0:20:14.400,0:20:16.100
Of course, this is the house of God.

0:20:16.100,0:20:20.040
The Bible says we should be a father to the fatherless and a benefactor to the needy.

0:20:20.040,0:20:23.380
That is what The SCOAN has been established for and that is what we are living for.

0:20:23.380,0:20:29.560
Right from the airport, they made their way to The SCOAN and they were blessed.

0:20:29.560,0:20:35.840
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:20:35.840,0:20:39.040
Now, as he made us to understand, he visited his house.

0:20:39.040,0:20:41.820
On getting there - the wife thought he was dead

0:20:41.820,0:20:45.220
and she got married to his closest friend who is standing by him here.

0:20:45.220,0:20:48.060
And the son he left behind is already dead.

0:20:48.060,0:20:52.780
But we have to understand one thing: His friend came here, simply because he heard

0:20:52.780,0:20:56.540
how the man of God had been helping people who were deported.

0:20:56.540,0:21:00.940
He is a very good friend of his. And when he learnt that the man of God helped his closest friend,

0:21:00.940,0:21:07.560
after he was deported with nothing from Libya, with a certain amount of money and two bags of rice,

0:21:07.560,0:21:11.380
he said he has to join him to The SCOAN to give thanks to God

0:21:11.380,0:21:13.820
and receive prayer for his own blessing as well.

0:21:13.820,0:21:20.080
Let's clap for Jesus Christ for them!

0:21:20.080,0:21:22.080
So, let's hear from his friend.

0:21:22.080,0:21:25.140
My name is Sulaimon Abolaji.

0:21:25.140,0:21:32.280
I am here because of my friend. We all live together in Ejigbo.

0:21:32.280,0:21:34.920
We heard that he had already died.

0:21:34.920,0:21:40.100
I took over taking care of his wife when he left.

0:21:40.100,0:21:44.040
After waiting a long time without seeing him,

0:21:44.040,0:21:50.420
with the information we had that he was already dead, I got married to his wife.

0:21:50.420,0:21:54.240
We were surprised when we saw him.

0:21:54.240,0:22:00.020
I was among those who poured sand on him, asking him if he was still alive.

0:22:00.020,0:22:02.020
But we thank God.

0:22:02.020,0:22:04.540
He is my best friend.

0:22:04.540,0:22:10.820
Due to what happened, we sat down, talked and reasoned together.

0:22:10.820,0:22:20.240
The main thing that brought me here is that when he explained to me that it was The SCOAN

0:22:20.240,0:22:24.360
that assisted him - he explained the whole story to me

0:22:24.360,0:22:27.420
and I had been hearing a lot of things about The SCOAN.

0:22:27.420,0:22:33.060
I have a friend who is a muslim who works with the ministry

0:22:33.060,0:22:35.280
because he knows that the man of God (T.B. Joshua) does not discriminate -

0:22:35.280,0:22:41.700
he does not look at tribe or religion. I also heard the same thing from my friend.

0:22:41.700,0:22:45.040
That is why I deemed it fit to come here.

0:22:45.040,0:22:53.500
If only the whole of Nigeria is watching and can emulate what Prophet T.B. Joshua has been doing

0:22:53.500,0:22:57.280
in our country, I think things would be better than they are.

0:22:57.280,0:23:02.920
That is why I came.

0:23:02.920,0:23:04.480
That is not enough for Jesus Christ!

0:23:04.480,0:23:10.620
Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:23:10.620,0:23:16.860
All I want is for him to forgive and forget everything that has happened.

0:23:16.860,0:23:20.640
That is how God wants it and I still love him as a friend.

0:23:20.640,0:23:25.560
That is why I deemed it fit to come down to this place to rejoice with him.

0:23:25.560,0:23:30.960
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:23:30.960,0:23:38.900
