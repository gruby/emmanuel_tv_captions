This lady walks to The Synagogue Church of All Nations aided by her mother.

0:00:06.780,0:00:12.480
You can see from the looks on
 her face that she is in excruciating pain.

0:00:12.480,0:00:15.820
Without the use of the lumbar corset around her waist,

0:00:15.820,0:00:20.160
carrying out daily activities will be very difficult.

0:00:20.160,0:00:31.760
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!

0:00:31.760,0:00:37.140
Having moved from one place to another without a solution to this problem,

0:00:37.140,0:00:42.560
she has come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, believing that there is never a sickness

0:00:42.560,0:00:48.860
Jesus Christ cannot heal and never a disease He cannot cure.

0:00:48.860,0:00:51.860
These are medical reports from the hospital,

0:00:51.860,0:01:01.000
stating the level at which her discs have been damaged.

0:01:01.000,0:01:09.700
She has come with a problem of difficulty in walking due to prolapsed disc and lumbar sacralization.

0:01:09.700,0:01:20.820
The X-ray next to her further 
explains the severity of the problem.

0:01:20.820,0:01:23.840
She uses a lumbar corset to support herself.

0:01:23.840,0:01:27.320
She has had this problem for the past two years.

0:01:27.320,0:01:31.380
This is the lumbar corset which she uses to support herself

0:01:31.380,0:01:36.120
in order to hold her spine in place to prevent further damage.

0:01:36.120,0:01:53.880
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!

0:01:53.880,0:01:55.920
Welcome to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.

0:01:55.920,0:01:58.000
Please tell us your name and where you're from.

0:01:58.000,0:02:00.800
My name is Tayo Akhamie. I'm from Nigeria.

0:02:00.800,0:02:02.880
What are you doing for a living, Ma?

0:02:02.880,0:02:07.180
I'm a legal practitioner, but I had to defer my PhD studies.

0:02:07.180,0:02:13.380
I was going for International Diplomacy and Human Relations for my PhD.

0:02:13.380,0:02:16.240
Madam, what is the problem that brought you here today?

0:02:16.240,0:02:20.180
The problem that brought me here today is difficulty in walking

0:02:20.180,0:02:27.260
due to prolapsed disc and lumbar sacralization of the spine.

0:02:27.260,0:02:30.260
As a result, I'm using a lumbar corset.

0:02:30.260,0:02:32.560
For how long have you been having this problem?

0:02:32.560,0:02:34.820
For two years.

0:02:34.820,0:02:37.640
How has this problem affected your life, Madam?

0:02:37.640,0:02:42.460
It has affected me a whole lot. I cannot walk without assistance,

0:02:42.460,0:02:51.100
I had to resign from my job. I get assistance in bathing and changing

0:02:51.100,0:02:54.280
and it has made my life miserable.

0:02:54.280,0:02:59.840
I cannot breathe very well. I usually faint because of the pain

0:02:59.840,0:03:03.800
and  the nerves are affected.

0:03:03.800,0:03:12.820
As a result, I had to stop my PhD because I cannot read, understand and focus.

0:03:12.820,0:03:17.120
OK, Madam. So where have you been in search of solution for this problem?

0:03:17.120,0:03:27.920
I've been in Scotland, Germany, England and in California - no solution.

0:03:27.920,0:03:32.520
OK. We can see an X-ray next to you. 
Could you please explain the X-ray.

0:03:32.520,0:03:34.560
What is it all about?

0:03:34.560,0:03:40.560
This X-ray is all about my spine,

0:03:40.560,0:03:46.940
One concentrates on the lumbar spine which is turned around.

0:03:46.940,0:03:48.880
It is somewhere here.

0:03:48.880,0:03:51.220
And that is why it is called the 'sacralization'.

0:03:51.220,0:03:57.500
'Sacralization' means fully turned around and it no longer becomes the disc it was.

0:03:57.500,0:03:59.760
You can't identify this.

0:03:59.760,0:04:04.060
The other X-ray is the one that passes through my chest and up.

0:04:04.060,0:04:12.500
I also have a prolapsed disc on this one.

0:04:12.500,0:04:19.740
It has affected my body and I also have trapped nerves in between my discs.

0:04:19.740,0:04:23.180
As a result of that, it has affected all my organs.

0:04:23.180,0:04:31.060
My organs are very challenged and out of 100%, my organs are functioning at 41%.

0:04:31.060,0:04:41.640
My muscle tone and balance is also very challenged and is functioning at 44% out of 100%.

0:04:41.640,0:04:49.120
As a result, if you pinch me with a needle or insert something through my skin,

0:04:49.120,0:04:51.400
I rarely feel the pain.

0:04:51.400,0:04:56.440
We can see a lumbar corset. Could you please tell us more about it, Madam.

0:04:56.440,0:05:04.300
The lumbar corset is used to support my lumbar spine so that it can be in alignment

0:05:04.300,0:05:09.140
because I also have misalignment of the spine

0:05:09.140,0:05:14.300
because the muscles around my spine are degenerating very fast.

0:05:14.300,0:05:22.420
When I stand, my muscle cannot 
hold the spine in place and then it shifts

0:05:22.420,0:05:27.900
and causes the nerves to be trapped in-between my spine.

0:05:27.900,0:05:30.980
You mean, without this lumbar corset, you cannot walk?

0:05:30.980,0:05:35.020
No, without this lumbar corset, I cannot walk or sit.

0:05:35.020,0:05:41.360
Out of the 24 vertebrates, I have only six functioning a little bit.

0:05:41.360,0:05:45.280
As you can see on this diagram,
 this was gotten from a recent machine.

0:05:45.280,0:05:50.820
It got this from a recent machine that was brought from NASA.

0:05:50.820,0:05:55.460
This machine is only being used for astronauts before they go to space

0:05:55.460,0:05:57.020
and when they come back.

0:05:57.020,0:06:03.600
This diagram depicts the nerves that are being affected.

0:06:03.600,0:06:07.380
My muscles and tone balance are very challenged.

0:06:07.380,0:06:10.900
I can barely stand or walk straight.

0:06:10.900,0:06:15.960
I barely have the strength to carry myself because my muscles are extremely weak.

0:06:15.960,0:06:27.620
I have done operations, I have done facet injections injected in my spine but all to no avail.

0:06:27.620,0:06:29.820
That was why I came here.

0:06:29.820,0:06:34.520
I believe that I will get healed of all my pains and infirmities, in Jesus' name.

0:06:34.520,0:06:37.320
Amen. We believe with you that Jesus Christ will heal you

0:06:37.320,0:06:39.560
for the salvation of your soul, in Jesus name.

0:06:39.560,0:06:40.760
Amen.

0:06:40.760,0:06:53.740
HEALING TIME

0:06:53.740,0:06:57.780
Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua ministering prayers to the people

0:06:57.780,0:07:01.240
who have come to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations prayer line.

0:07:01.240,0:07:07.200
As he does, healing, deliverance 
and all of God's blessings are released on them,

0:07:07.200,0:07:11.540
uprooting whatever that is not of God in their lives.

0:07:11.540,0:07:18.140
Man of God, help me!
Man of God, help my daughter! Please help me!

0:07:18.140,0:07:22.400
Please, Man of God, help me!
I have lumbar sacralization of the spine.

0:07:22.400,0:07:23.780
Man of God, help me.

0:07:23.800,0:07:27.940
As a result of this, I have trapped discs in-between my spine

0:07:27.940,0:07:31.300
I suffer from insomnia, I have to take  drugs to sleep.

0:07:31.300,0:07:32.980
Man of God, please help me!

0:07:32.980,0:07:35.700
I have gastritis. Man of God, please help me.

0:07:35.700,0:07:40.320
I have pneumonia as a result of this. Man of God, please help me.

0:07:40.320,0:07:42.400
Please, I can't walk. Man of God, help me.

0:07:42.400,0:07:46.080
I've been to everywhere to no avail. 
Man of God, please help me.

0:07:46.080,0:07:51.240
I'm dying gradually. Please help me.

0:07:51.240,0:07:53.720
Man of God, please help my daughter.

0:07:53.720,0:07:59.240
She cannot sleep well, she cannot sit for the past two years.

0:07:59.240,0:08:02.200
Severally, she tried to kill herself.

0:08:02.200,0:08:06.280
Please help me, Man of God. I can't do anything on my own.

0:08:06.280,0:08:12.820
My organs are gradually dying. Out of 100%, my organs are only functioning 41%.

0:08:12.820,0:08:16.420
My muscle and tone balance is very low; it is life threatening.

0:08:16.420,0:08:19.640
Out of 100%, only 44% are functioning.

0:08:19.640,0:08:22.420
I can't do anything on my own, I can't reason well.

0:08:22.420,0:08:26.600
I'm a lawyer but I can't work; I can't practice; I can't represent people in court.

0:08:26.600,0:08:31.500
I deferred my PhD because of this; please, help me!

0:08:31.500,0:08:33.880
Please, I have difficulty walking.

0:08:33.880,0:08:37.840
Please, Man of God, help me.
I have lumbar sacralization of the spine.

0:08:37.840,0:08:38.940
Come on.

0:08:38.940,0:09:24.160
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:09:24.160,0:09:29.840
Thank You, Jesus, for healing my daughter! Thank You, Lord!

0:09:29.840,0:09:44.440
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:09:44.440,0:09:46.980
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:09:46.980,0:09:54.720
Thank You, Jesus, I can walk!

0:09:54.720,0:09:56.460
I'm healed! Thank You, Jesus!

0:09:56.460,0:10:00.600
I'm healed! I can walk! Thank You, Jesus!

0:10:00.600,0:10:03.200
I am free! Thank You, Jesus!

0:10:03.200,0:10:08.480
My daughter is healed!
Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!

0:10:08.480,0:10:14.920
After her healing from difficulty in walking due to a prolapsed disc and lumbar sacralization,

0:10:14.920,0:10:18.900
Miss Tayo Akhamie came back to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations

0:10:18.900,0:10:24.440
the next service day to share her wonderful testimony to the glory of God.

0:10:24.440,0:10:29.000
On the left, you can see how she came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations

0:10:29.000,0:10:34.500
in excruciating pain and barely 
able to walk unassisted by her mother.

0:10:34.500,0:10:38.020
But today, Miss Tayo is a different 
person.

0:10:38.020,0:10:42.580
With a vibrant smile, she can now freely move around pain-free.

0:10:42.580,0:10:44.220
Let's listen to her.

0:10:44.220,0:10:50.400
TESTIMONY TIME

0:10:50.400,0:10:52.480
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:10:52.480,0:10:55.960
Children of God, shout 'Emmanuel'!

0:10:55.960,0:10:58.580
My name is Akhamie Tayo.

0:10:58.580,0:11:06.400
I am a legal practitioner and I was about to start my PhD before I had this problem

0:11:06.400,0:11:09.180
which brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.

0:11:09.180,0:11:13.920
It all started two years back in Aberdeen, Scotland.

0:11:13.920,0:11:23.500
I travelled on an extensive trip and when I got back, I had a slight headache.

0:11:23.500,0:11:25.720
I prayed and went to bed.

0:11:25.720,0:11:31.380
I got up with excruciating pain and 
went to shower.

0:11:31.380,0:11:39.420
Walking to the bathroom. I took three to four steps; then, I stopped.

0:11:39.420,0:11:42.720
I got stuck and didn't know what I was doing.

0:11:42.720,0:11:49.720
I couldn't move my legs or my arms; I was sweating profusely and shaking.

0:11:49.720,0:11:55.240
I could not communicate with my mouth, only with my eyes.

0:11:55.240,0:11:59.380
I was lucky that my friend was around to help me.

0:11:59.380,0:12:05.520
She said,  "Toya, if you cannot communicate, blink your eyes for me.

0:12:05.520,0:12:14.100
When I ask you about the problem, if it is 'yes', blink once and 'no' blink twice".

0:12:14.100,0:12:17.160
That was how I could communicate before the ambulance came.

0:12:17.160,0:12:22.020
Thereafter, I was in the hospital, and it grew worse.

0:12:22.020,0:12:28.200
They tried all sorts of tests and the case was getting worse.

0:12:28.200,0:12:32.020
For over a month, I was placed on constant acupuncture,

0:12:32.020,0:12:34.640
every morning and evening but it didn't  work.

0:12:34.640,0:12:41.500
Besides that, I always had steroids injected into my spine.

0:12:41.500,0:12:48.260
As time went on, I was told that surgery would be my only way out

0:12:48.260,0:12:55.120
but professional advice was that I was too young to have that surgery performed.

0:12:55.120,0:13:03.040
As a result of that, I had a misalignment of the spine from my axis to my coccyx,

0:13:03.040,0:13:11.900
which is the spine underneath my skull down to my tailbone.

0:13:11.900,0:13:23.520
This misalignment caused the nerves to be pressed in-between my spine.

0:13:23.520,0:13:27.840
As a result, all my organs in my body were affected.

0:13:27.840,0:13:35.260
Out of 100%, my muscle and tone balance only worked 44%.

0:13:35.260,0:13:42.080
Out of 100%, my hormones and organs only worked 41%.

0:13:42.080,0:13:49.540
In the vertebra, you will find 24 nerves.

0:13:49.540,0:13:56.220
Out of 24, I only had 6 functioning.

0:13:56.220,0:13:59.540
The nerve that passes through the axis

0:13:59.540,0:14:05.620
which is the one that holds the neck and the skull was severely damaged.

0:14:05.620,0:14:11.340
As a result, you could see the damage throughout -

0:14:11.340,0:14:18.580
from my skin, nails and hair loss, to all the essential organs in my body.

0:14:18.580,0:14:21.420
I was dying slowly.

0:14:21.420,0:14:27.880
I realized that there was no cure for this and the pain kept occurring.

0:14:27.880,0:14:34.220
I was too sore to go for physiotherapy and I could not really do anything.

0:14:34.220,0:14:37.080
I travelled from one place to another but at the end of the day,

0:14:37.080,0:14:40.920
I found out that the only solution was God - Jesus Christ.

0:14:40.920,0:14:43.320
That was why I came here.

0:14:43.320,0:14:48.300
When I came, I was fixed on the prayer line and the anointed man of God,

0:14:48.300,0:14:52.680
Prophet T.B. Joshua, stretched his hand forward and prayed for me.

0:14:52.680,0:14:58.080
Instantly, I fell to the ground.

0:14:58.080,0:15:02.600
I didn't know where I was and for a moment, I was oblivious

0:15:02.600,0:15:04.980
of what was happening around me physically.

0:15:04.980,0:15:09.960
The only thing I could hear where little voices but I could not see anybody.

0:15:09.960,0:15:12.080
I didn't know where I was.

0:15:12.080,0:15:15.740
In my mind I started fighting. I thought I was hallucinating.

0:15:15.740,0:15:18.260
I was thinking, "What is happening? Am I alone in the church?"

0:15:18.260,0:15:20.560
I couldn't see or hear anything,

0:15:20.560,0:15:25.920
Then, I heard a voice inside saying, "Get up! You are healed!

0:15:25.920,0:15:27.680
You are healed, in the name of Jesus!

0:15:27.680,0:15:31.080
You can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens you".

0:15:31.080,0:15:37.540
I got up. Instantaneously, I had no pain and I found myself walking.

0:15:37.540,0:15:46.640
Day by day, I've been getting stronger and stronger and stronger.

0:15:46.660,0:15:50.040
Now I'm free! This is my first time standing.

0:15:50.040,0:15:54.240
Before I couldn't sit down for one minute; I couldn't sit straight.

0:15:54.240,0:16:00.000
Now, I can sit for hours, I can stand, turn and twirl.

0:16:00.000,0:16:01.820
You can see God is wonderful.

0:16:01.820,0:16:07.040
I can squat. God is wonderful; praise God!

0:16:07.040,0:16:10.700
My name is John Akhamie.

0:16:10.700,0:16:15.600
I'm the father of Tayo - my last born.

0:16:15.600,0:16:20.520
She was preparing for her PhD program

0:16:20.520,0:16:26.600
when I received a telephone call from Scotland, precisely Aberdeen,

0:16:26.600,0:16:31.680
that my daughter was sick, bedridden, had been admitted

0:16:31.680,0:16:33.680
and that it was a very serious case.

0:16:33.680,0:16:42.000
She had a problem with her spine and needed urgent surgery

0:16:42.000,0:16:45.760
but they were afraid because of her age.

0:16:45.760,0:16:51.820
There was just a 50/50 chance of her surviving that type of surgery.

0:16:51.820,0:17:02.620
That it could lead to a total collapse of the nervous system or sudden death.

0:17:02.620,0:17:07.260
Because of that, they decided to use alternative methods -

0:17:07.260,0:17:16.940
giving her pain-relieving tablets and steroid injections but there was no response.

0:17:16.940,0:17:20.600
From there, she went to other parts of Europe.

0:17:20.600,0:17:25.840
In London, she was also admitted but there was no solution.

0:17:25.840,0:17:33.040
From there, we flew her to the United States, California, for the same problem

0:17:33.040,0:17:34.760
but there was no solution.

0:17:34.760,0:17:39.480
The doctors emphatically said that there was no solution

0:17:39.480,0:17:43.280
other than the surgery they did not advise.

0:17:43.280,0:17:47.460
That we should be patient and watch.

0:17:47.460,0:17:52.520
It was then that I asked my mother for the way out.

0:17:52.520,0:17:56.560
She said that she believed the way out was to come to The SCOAN.

0:17:56.560,0:18:02.080
I said that she was in the US and asked how she could take a flight to Nigeria.

0:18:02.080,0:18:09.040
She was merely given a lumbar corset to support her spine.

0:18:09.040,0:18:16.280
My wife sent the Anointing Water to one of my daughters in Los Angeles.

0:18:16.280,0:18:21.580
She ministered the Anointing Water on her and she regained some strength.

0:18:21.580,0:18:26.000
Then, she came back to Nigeria.

0:18:26.000,0:18:30.380
My reaction when I could not recognize my daughter was that I wept.

0:18:30.380,0:18:38.460
By that time, deformity had set in; she developed a hunchback

0:18:38.460,0:18:44.340
and the bottom of her backbone was curved.

0:18:44.340,0:18:48.480
In fact, she was very skinny and looking sickly.

0:18:48.480,0:18:50.600
She could not support herself.

0:18:50.600,0:18:56.440
She would lie down and couldn't get up unless we sat her up.

0:18:56.440,0:18:59.120
That was the situation.

0:18:59.120,0:19:03.080
My wife decided to bring her to The SCOAN.

0:19:03.080,0:19:08.940
When they eventually came back in the night, I heard noise downstairs.

0:19:08.940,0:19:13.420
My daughter was shouting and calling my name, "Daddy, I am healed!"

0:19:13.420,0:19:21.500
She ran upstairs and was jumping.

0:19:21.500,0:19:26.680
She was jumping up and down; she took my hands and was taking me round.

0:19:26.680,0:19:31.680
I said, "Is this my daughter?" I could not believe it.

0:19:31.680,0:19:39.600
She opened her apparel and I could see that the hunchback had disappeared.

0:19:39.600,0:19:48.420
Her backbone had straightened as she used to be in those days.

0:19:48.420,0:19:56.520
I give glory to God. To me, this is the biggest miracle in my life.

0:19:56.520,0:20:00.860
While she was undergoing this pain, I was also feeling the pain.

0:20:00.860,0:20:04.920
I would go to my bedroom and quietly shed tears.

0:20:04.920,0:20:09.580
Occasionally, she would call me and say, "Daddy, I know you have tried for me,

0:20:09.580,0:20:11.880
and mummy has also tried. I want to go".

0:20:11.880,0:20:14.680
I would say, "Where are you going to? Don't say that again".

0:20:14.680,0:20:18.080
"I want to go." - she kept repeating that.

0:20:18.080,0:20:23.160
Now, she is very strong and since that day, she is getting stronger and stronger.

0:20:23.160,0:20:29.040
I also noticed that all the rashes on her skin,

0:20:29.040,0:20:33.780
and the veins that were coming out disappeared.

0:20:33.780,0:20:35.780
She now has a good skin.

0:20:35.780,0:20:40.460
This shows that every part of her body has been healed.

0:20:40.460,0:20:43.560
I give glory to God.

0:20:43.560,0:20:47.480
Since that day, every morning my daughter wakes me up

0:20:47.480,0:20:50.220
and leads me on a jog around the compound.

0:20:50.220,0:20:56.100
She dances and can twirl around 360 degrees; this she could not do before.

0:20:56.100,0:21:00.720
She can jump up and is very healthy as if she was never sick before.

0:21:00.720,0:21:03.220
There is another aspect to it.

0:21:03.220,0:21:09.740
When she was coming back from the U.S., the doctors were told

0:21:09.740,0:21:15.880
that she was bringing the X-rays as a requirement to come to The SCOAN.

0:21:15.880,0:21:20.080
They said that the sickness could not be cured and that we were just wasting our time.

0:21:20.080,0:21:25.220
They said that if she received her healing, they would be interested.

0:21:25.220,0:21:30.040
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!

0:21:30.040,0:21:41.440
I thank God Almighty for His grace in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:21:41.440,0:21:46.480
This singular incident is a milestone in my life.

0:21:46.480,0:21:49.960
It is an incident I will never forget in my life.

0:21:49.960,0:21:53.180
It has increased my faith in the Lord.

0:21:53.180,0:22:01.960
For the whole world to know, Prophet T.B. Joshua has super grace in his life.

0:22:01.960,0:22:08.400
It is just unexplainable; it is a mystery.

0:22:08.400,0:22:14.880
My daughter went around the whole world to the best hospitals.

0:22:14.880,0:22:20.140
It was a sickness they said could not be cured and that it was impossible.

0:22:20.140,0:22:28.260
She came to The SCOAN and in a split second, she was healed.

0:22:28.260,0:22:29.660
Thank you.

0:22:29.660,0:22:34.260
Let's now go back to what actually happened to the little girl and the father.

0:22:34.260,0:22:39.460
What happened to you when I drew you down suddenly?

0:22:39.460,0:22:44.440
You were here for healing, for prayer
and you expected me to lay hand

0:22:44.440,0:22:47.680
and begin to say, "I rebuke, in Jesus' name!",

0:22:47.680,0:22:49.940
"I heal you, in Jesus' name!"

0:22:49.940,0:22:52.500
"I bind that sickness, in Jesus' name!"

0:22:52.500,0:22:56.440
So that you too would be saying, "Amen!"

0:22:56.440,0:23:02.540
But instead of that, I went towards you and dragged you on the floor.

0:23:02.540,0:23:06.680
What came upon you when I dragged you as if I was fighting you?

0:23:06.680,0:23:13.360
Okay. The first impression was that I heard you shout and say, "Get up!"

0:23:13.360,0:23:18.660
I was thinking, "I can't get up, of course".

0:23:18.660,0:23:33.140
I was wondering if I was shameful or bad that he forced me to get up.

0:23:33.140,0:23:39.860
I thought, "He is very angry; I must be a terrible sinner".

0:23:39.860,0:23:49.200
That was what that spirit that caused that terrible pain deserved!

0:23:49.200,0:23:57.360
I was not fighting her; I was fighting that spirit that caused her pain.

0:23:57.360,0:24:03.920
I was not trying to be hard on her but on the spirit that caused her pain.

0:24:03.920,0:24:09.360
I was very aggressive towards that spirit because I was not happy.

0:24:09.360,0:24:17.280
How can a young lady trying to get her PhD be arrested, be caged with this stupid pain?

0:24:17.280,0:24:22.520
I was looking at this spirit and wondering, "What is wrong with you, you evil spirit?

0:24:22.520,0:24:25.080
Why should you do that?"

0:24:25.080,0:24:27.260
I was fighting that spirit.

0:24:27.260,0:24:33.660
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!

0:24:33.660,0:24:42.280
So it was unnecessary to now give my attention to that evil spirit.

0:24:42.280,0:24:48.740
I did not want to give attention to the spirit; rather I wanted to embarrass this spirit.

0:24:48.740,0:24:51.100
Hallelujah.

0:24:51.100,0:24:56.980
God heals, we treat.

0:24:56.980,0:25:03.320
We all - medical doctors, physicians, whatever - treat while God heals.

0:25:03.320,0:25:04.780
That's true, sir.

0:25:04.780,0:25:08.560
Thank you. What can you say to the world with your age?

0:25:08.560,0:25:15.800
Before I give my advice, please I would like to shed some light on the items on the board.

0:25:15.800,0:25:22.680
This is one of the last tests I went for.

0:25:22.680,0:25:28.120
This machine is one of its kind; it just came out and it is from NASA.

0:25:28.120,0:25:32.340
They use this machine for astronauts before they go into space

0:25:32.340,0:25:34.300
and when they come back.

0:25:34.300,0:25:41.880
It is to detect the cause of the problem even before it starts to manifest.

0:25:41.880,0:25:46.940
I brought this because it is easily explainable.

0:25:46.940,0:25:49.300
This is how the spine is.

0:25:49.300,0:25:54.480
You have from the atlas to the coccyx which is the tail of the spine.

0:25:54.480,0:25:59.280
The atlas holds the skull on the neck.

0:25:59.280,0:26:07.900
This is all the way down to the coccyx in your pelvic.

0:26:07.900,0:26:10.900
This diagram explains this.

0:26:10.900,0:26:18.740
If you take a closer look at this vertebra, you will see some of the vertebra underlined.

0:26:18.740,0:26:22.460
These were all the vertebra I had problems with.

0:26:22.460,0:26:25.380
All these nerves passing through this vertebra, I had problems with.

0:26:25.380,0:26:30.020
Out of 24, I only had 6 functioning.

0:26:30.020,0:26:36.560
If you take a look at 1C, you will see the areas controlled by the nerves

0:26:36.560,0:26:42.480
and you can see what the problem was: blood supply to the head, pituitary gland,

0:26:42.480,0:26:52.020
scalp, bones of the face, brain, inner and middle ear, sympathetic nervous system.

0:26:52.020,0:26:56.100
And these would be the possible effects of the malfunction:

0:26:56.100,0:27:02.400
headache, neurosis, insomnia, head colds, high blood pressure,

0:27:02.400,0:27:04.940
migraine headaches and so on and so forth.

0:27:04.940,0:27:08.000
If you take a good look down, you will see that

0:27:08.000,0:27:14.260
I had a problem in almost all the vertebra and I had a complex problem.

0:27:14.260,0:27:25.200
Now, if you come here, this is the EMC machine. I don't know what it is really called.

0:27:25.200,0:27:30.340
It's so advanced. This machine detects the nerves that have a problem.

0:27:30.340,0:27:35.040
If you come down here, you will see that this is the overall graph.

0:27:35.040,0:27:45.020
Here is danger, which is my axis and now if you come here, you will see C1, C1, C3, C3.

0:27:45.020,0:27:49.040
You see that it is black. If you come here, you will see that this is C3.

0:27:49.040,0:27:57.380
And this is what - cheeks, outer ear, 
face bones, teeth, trifacial nerve.

0:27:57.380,0:28:01.260
The black means it is damaged - beyond repair -

0:28:01.260,0:28:04.840
and that shows how bad my body was.

0:28:04.840,0:28:07.580
If you could see my spine, it was almost like a Christmas tree

0:28:07.580,0:28:09.180
because you could see numerous colors.

0:28:09.180,0:28:12.880
The normal spine is supposed to be like this - just plain and healthy.

0:28:12.880,0:28:18.580
But I had colors everywhere - measuring the temperature of the pain

0:28:18.580,0:28:23.520
and the extent of the damage in my body.

0:28:23.520,0:28:26.640
To be honest, when I had the tests done,

0:28:26.640,0:28:31.460
there were other Asian doctors coming to the room to look at me.

0:28:31.460,0:28:34.200
Why? Because they had a slight argument

0:28:34.200,0:28:37.220
when they saw the various reports that came from one person.

0:28:37.220,0:28:41.240
They argued and said, "No, it's not possible that one person can have all this!

0:28:41.240,0:28:45.420
I'm sure you must be mistaken. Maybe, you made a mistake somewhere.

0:28:45.420,0:28:47.840
It can't be from one person".

0:28:47.840,0:28:51.180
The doctor then replied that it was from one person.

0:28:51.180,0:28:56.960
Funny enough, when they came to look at me, they said, "Hi" and I responded.

0:28:56.960,0:29:02.640
They actually came to see if I was assisted by a form of stretcher or something.

0:29:02.640,0:29:07.360
They couldn't believe that I could reason well.

0:29:07.360,0:29:13.620
But after the man of God prayed for me, you see that all these disappeared.

0:29:13.620,0:29:22.180
I can turn, squat, twirl, I am so happy. I can jump and do much more.

0:29:22.180,0:29:24.860
I'm so happy! Praise God!

0:29:24.860,0:29:27.620
Hallelujah. You have listened to our sister.

0:29:27.620,0:29:34.560
Look at the old picture and the present picture. She looked old in the former picture.

0:29:34.560,0:29:37.800
No one could believe that she is a young girl.

0:29:37.800,0:29:41.480
At that former picture, she looked very, very old.

0:29:41.480,0:29:46.580
But now, she looks very young and just one week healing.

0:29:46.580,0:29:54.280
By the next two months, I think she will be a 15 years-old baby.

0:29:54.280,0:29:57.600
Hallelujah. This is to tell you that when you are healed,

0:29:57.600,0:30:01.040
you are healed in your fluids, in your blood and in your muscles.

0:30:01.040,0:30:04.180
The cause of that sickness is in the blood.

0:30:04.180,0:30:09.600
So not only just making you walk but right to the root of that problem.

0:30:09.600,0:30:16.020
That is the fluid, the blood because that sickness is in the blood.

0:30:16.020,0:30:19.520
That is causing the face to deform.

0:30:19.520,0:30:24.920
So the Spirit of God has to go there straight and get it uprooted from the blood.

0:30:24.920,0:30:31.300
Not just to make her walk. If it is just to make her walk, it would be temporary healing.

0:30:31.300,0:30:35.100
Later, the thing will still fall down because it's in the blood.

0:30:35.100,0:30:40.200
So that is the healing of God. When you are healed, you are healed perpetually.

0:30:40.200,0:30:42.660
And indeed, you are healed.

0:30:42.660,0:30:44.240
Thank You, Lord.

0:30:44.240,0:30:48.180
What a radical transformation within less than a week.

0:30:48.180,0:30:53.020
On the left, we can see how deformed her waist was due to the spinal problem

0:30:53.020,0:30:56.120
and having to wear a very tight lumbar corset.

0:30:56.120,0:30:59.580
Her face was also very pale and full of pimples.

0:30:59.580,0:31:04.200
But instantly after her healing, her skin color returned to normal,

0:31:04.200,0:31:06.800
leaving her with a now glowing skin,

0:31:06.800,0:31:11.320
proving the complete internal healing she received in Jesus' name.

0:31:11.320,0:31:16.520
Not only was her spinal cord restored, but her blood and every organ of our body

0:31:16.520,0:31:19.960
has been renewed by the Master Healer, Jesus Christ.

0:31:19.960,0:31:21.640
Glory be to God.

0:31:21.640,0:31:27.440
