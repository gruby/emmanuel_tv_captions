The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:11.160,0:00:16.680
I want to take you up on a special issue today.

0:00:16.680,0:00:20.720
I realised people don’t give anymore.

0:00:20.720,0:00:26.700
When you meet people today, they will say they have nothing or little.

0:00:26.700,0:00:31.680
Giving reshapes our destiny.

0:00:31.680,0:00:33.320
Tell your neighbour.

0:00:33.320,0:00:41.420
Giving reshapes our destiny.

0:00:41.420,0:00:51.520
When you give with all your heart, not giving for selfish, classical or material reasons,

0:00:51.520,0:00:54.140
it is reshaping your destiny.

0:00:54.140,0:00:56.860
People don't give today.

0:00:56.860,0:01:07.240
They say, "I don't have. I have little for my family. It is difficult for me to share, to part with it."

0:01:07.240,0:01:09.820
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

0:01:09.820,0:01:22.660
We take our reading from the Book of Luke 16.

0:01:22.660,0:01:29.160
“Jesus told his disciples: ‘There was a rich man

0:01:29.160,0:01:34.280
whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions'".

0:01:34.280,0:01:38.300
I'm taking reading from verse 1.

0:01:38.300,0:01:46.980
"'So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you?

0:01:46.980,0:01:54.940
Give an account of your management because you cannot be manager any longer.’"

0:01:54.940,0:01:58.140
That is a boss speaking to his staff.

0:01:58.140,0:02:05.020
“’The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now?’”

0:02:05.020,0:02:08.680
Let's go to the proof text - verse 10.

0:02:08.680,0:02:15.580
“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,

0:02:15.580,0:02:23.160
and whoever is dishonest with little will also be dishonest with much."

0:02:23.160,0:02:26.120
Think about that.

0:02:26.120,0:02:39.460
“So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?

0:02:39.460,0:02:47.520
And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property,

0:02:47.520,0:02:53.600
who will give you property of your own?”

0:02:53.600,0:03:03.260
Take your time to read 1 Corinthians 14:16,

0:03:03.260,0:03:09.420
and the Book of Mark 12:42-44

0:03:09.420,0:03:20.220
and the Book of Matthew 25:22-24.

0:03:20.220,0:03:40.520
Here we are today with numerous challenges – stagnation, career failure, affliction – just name it.

0:03:40.520,0:03:46.720
Glory be to God – there is hope.

0:03:46.720,0:03:55.740
The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.

0:03:55.740,0:03:57.580
Tell your neighbour.

0:03:57.580,0:04:01.780
The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.

0:04:01.780,0:04:03.380
That is hope.

0:04:03.380,0:04:11.120
The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.

0:04:11.120,0:04:12.440
That is hope.

0:04:12.440,0:04:14.700
Tell your neighbour, "There is hope".

0:04:14.700,0:04:15.740
I cannot hear you.

0:04:15.740,0:04:17.300
There is hope.

0:04:17.300,0:04:23.720
The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.

0:04:23.720,0:04:24.940
That is hope.

0:04:24.940,0:04:28.660
This is why you should be calm.

0:04:28.660,0:04:35.300
There is no need of worrying yourself; leave it for God.

0:04:35.300,0:04:42.600
From the Book of Mark 12:42-44

0:04:42.600,0:04:50.260
and the Book of Matthew 25:22-24, which I have given you,

0:04:50.260,0:04:57.200
and 1 Corinthians 14:16.

0:04:57.200,0:04:59.640
GOD CARES ABOUT LITTLE

0:04:59.640,0:05:03.200
We are in the season of little.

0:05:03.200,0:05:05.180
No matter what you have.

0:05:05.180,0:05:18.240
The richest man in the world today will tell you that the things are little; it is not as it was before.

0:05:18.240,0:05:27.480
Businesses are becoming little, your income is becoming little, your strength - also the same.

0:05:27.480,0:05:31.800
Many people - from 3 bedrooms to 2 bedrooms.

0:05:31.800,0:05:38.600
Many begin to sell some of their property to still stand for the future.

0:05:38.600,0:05:42.480
Tell your neighbour, “We are in the season of little”.

0:05:42.480,0:05:44.580
It is a season.

0:05:44.580,0:05:46.600
Time for everything.

0:05:46.600,0:05:53.740
You may say it is an attack - no, it is not an attack, it is a season, it is everywhere.

0:05:53.740,0:06:01.400
Tell your neighbour, “God cares about little”.

0:06:01.400,0:06:22.620
One thing we must know today – we all believe that we can only give out of abundance.

0:06:22.620,0:06:34.740
Because we are used to giving only what we do not need,

0:06:34.740,0:06:44.560
what we have used, the left-over in our store or garage.

0:06:44.560,0:06:47.760
Somebody runs to you, "Please, help me!"

0:06:47.760,0:06:54.600
Instead of giving something you need, something your life depends on, something you cherish,

0:06:54.600,0:07:02.500
you open your store and give something you have used, something you do not need,

0:07:02.500,0:07:04.420
the left-over from your store.

0:07:04.420,0:07:08.840
You open your store and say, "This is a good tyre for you".

0:07:08.840,0:07:15.740
If it is a good tyre for you, why is it not good for you?

0:07:15.740,0:07:23.480
The left-over in our store; we are used to that.

0:07:23.480,0:07:26.280
Think back - what we have been giving to people.

0:07:26.280,0:07:32.580
They cherish it because they have no choice.

0:07:32.580,0:07:46.400
Whatever we give out of little, it means a lot to us because it attracts God’s attention.

0:07:46.400,0:07:55.100
This is why Jesus was watching the poor widow – because He cares about little.

0:07:55.100,0:07:59.260
He was watching the poor widow, while other rich people were going.

0:07:59.260,0:08:07.180
He was looking at the poorest woman among the crowd to see how much,

0:08:07.180,0:08:11.120
how she would part out of that little.

0:08:11.120,0:08:11.780
Tell your neighbour,

0:08:11.780,0:08:24.660
Whatever you give out of little, it means a lot to you because it attracts God’s attention.

0:08:24.660,0:08:34.060
If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things,

0:08:34.060,0:08:41.200
you cannot know how much you need God in the big things

0:08:41.200,0:08:43.840
because everything big starts little.

0:08:43.840,0:08:56.380
If something big starts big, it calls for concern.

0:08:56.380,0:09:07.740
How many of us here can tell me how much you need God to sit down or to stand up?

0:09:07.740,0:09:13.440
You don't need God to sit down because you can sit down.

0:09:13.440,0:09:22.080
No single person can tell me they rely on God’s strength to sit down.

0:09:22.080,0:09:26.800
No one can tell me he or she relies on God to stand up.

0:09:26.800,0:09:32.100
You want to stand up, you meditate in your heart, "In Jesus' name..."

0:09:32.100,0:09:35.020
You want to sit down, "In Jesus' name..." -

0:09:35.020,0:09:37.980
you can't do that!

0:09:37.980,0:09:38.680
Tell your neighbour,

0:09:38.680,0:09:46.280
If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things,

0:09:46.280,0:09:54.680
you cannot know how much you need Him in the big things.

0:09:54.680,0:09:58.400
This is why your relationship is in shambles.

0:09:58.400,0:10:02.520
There is cause for concern in your relationship with God

0:10:02.520,0:10:04.740
because you don’t know how much you need God.

0:10:04.740,0:10:08.320
Even to close your eyes, you need God.

0:10:08.320,0:10:11.480
To comb your hair, you need God.

0:10:11.480,0:10:13.080
To eat, you need God.

0:10:13.080,0:10:14.900
To dress up, you need God.

0:10:14.900,0:10:18.920
To walk, you need God.

0:10:18.920,0:10:23.580
To talk, you need God but you ignore that, do that on your own

0:10:23.580,0:10:26.320
because you believe you don’t need God to do all those things

0:10:26.320,0:10:33.200
but you only need God for your situation – to help you, heal you, prosper you.

0:10:33.200,0:10:36.360
This is just it.

0:10:36.360,0:10:40.140
If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things

0:10:40.140,0:10:55.440
such as to talk, look, walk, dress up, comb your hair or greet,

0:10:55.440,0:11:03.400
you will not know how much you need God to settle your situation.

0:11:03.400,0:11:09.380
Don’t forget you were once an embryo in your mother’s womb.

0:11:09.380,0:11:11.600
See what you have become today.

0:11:11.600,0:11:18.360
If you ignore your young, definitely you will ignore your old.

0:11:18.360,0:11:25.500
Please, pray without ceasing.

0:11:25.500,0:11:38.500
Constantly pray in your heart – in hymns, spiritual songs and making melodies in your heart.

0:11:38.500,0:11:40.760
Are you doing that now?

0:11:40.760,0:11:46.180
Are you in that business now, or you are just looking at me?

0:11:46.180,0:11:50.400
If you are just looking at me, your heart will be telling you a different thing.

0:11:50.400,0:11:56.760
While you are looking at me, it would be telling you, "Don't mind the man; it is difficult to do.

0:11:56.760,0:11:59.160
OK, anyway, God will help me."

0:11:59.160,0:12:02.100
Your heart will be saying different things, while you are looking at me.

0:12:02.100,0:12:08.720
You must get hold of your heart; control your heart.

0:12:08.720,0:12:16.740
When you are able to control your heart, then you will know how much you need God in small things.

0:12:16.740,0:12:20.940
When you want to stand; if you are in the meditation business -

0:12:20.940,0:12:24.480
if you want to stand, you say, "In Jesus' name. Thank You."

0:12:24.480,0:12:27.040
You are going, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:12:27.040,0:12:28.620
You want to stop, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:12:28.620,0:12:30.080
You want to greet, "Thank You, Jesus"

0:12:30.080,0:12:35.240
Because you are into that in your heart.

0:12:35.240,0:12:40.520
In the Book of Matthew 25:22-24,

0:12:40.520,0:12:58.140
God is constantly putting us to the test in the small things.

0:12:58.140,0:13:25.000
If we fail to bless others with the little God has given us, we may never grow.

0:13:25.000,0:13:30.900
That is why some of us remain in the same position.

0:13:30.900,0:13:51.900
If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things such as to walk, talk, stand or sit,

0:13:51.900,0:13:56.220
you will continue to have certain occasions for prayer.

0:13:56.220,0:14:03.060
That is why you have certain occasions..., "3 o'clock - I need to break my fasting, I need to go and pray."

0:14:03.060,0:14:06.520
Why a certain occasion for prayer?

0:14:06.520,0:14:11.360
This is why satan keeps getting that opportunity to get you.

0:14:11.360,0:14:20.920
The Bible says a break in prayer is a break in faith and a break is faith is a break with God.

0:14:20.920,0:14:21.640
Tell your neighbour,

0:14:21.640,0:14:31.560
A break in prayer is a break in faith; a break in faith is a break with God.

0:14:31.560,0:14:32.520
Tell your neighbour again,

0:14:32.520,0:14:51.260
A break in prayer is a break in faith; a break in faith is a break with God.

0:14:51.260,0:14:55.240
Certain occasions for prayer is a break with God.

0:14:55.240,0:14:58.980
The little time you have a break with God, satan gets you.

0:14:58.980,0:15:11.560
When you know how much you need God, you will pray without ceasing – pray continuously.

0:15:11.560,0:15:24.280
Prayer is the key
Prayer is the master key

0:15:24.280,0:15:35.540
Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer
Prayer is the master key

0:15:35.540,0:15:37.320
That is all.

0:15:37.320,0:15:42.540
Jesus started here and ended here;

0:15:42.540,0:15:46.820
He started with prayer, all throughout, and ended with prayer.

0:15:46.820,0:15:50.440
Why certain occasion for prayer?

0:15:50.440,0:15:54.820
Why is your life different from Jesus’ life?
He is our role model.

0:15:54.820,0:16:00.520
He started with prayer and ended with prayer but it seems you have certain occasions for prayer

0:16:00.520,0:16:05.960
because you don’t know how much you need Him in the small things.

0:16:05.960,0:16:18.400
Prayer is the key
Prayer is the master key

0:16:18.400,0:16:34.060
Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer
Prayer is the master key

0:16:34.060,0:16:44.020
Can you see why you are very accessible to satan?

0:16:44.020,0:16:47.520
He can get you anytime and he can drop you anytime.

0:16:47.520,0:16:51.220
He knows how to get you.

0:16:51.220,0:16:53.360
He knows when you are not with God.

0:16:53.360,0:16:56.240
He knows when you have a break with God.

0:16:56.240,0:17:00.020
Each time you have a break with God, he gets you.

0:17:00.020,0:17:02.740
Are you in the business of prayer right now?

0:17:02.740,0:17:15.720
Each time you have a break, you drop the master key to loose and bind.

0:17:15.720,0:17:20.260
Constantly pray in your heart.

0:17:20.260,0:17:22.360
Why in my heart?

0:17:22.360,0:17:30.340
Because your heart is the communication point, contact point.

0:17:30.340,0:17:31.180
That is all.

0:17:31.180,0:17:35.240
If Jesus is coming to you, it is to your heart.

0:17:35.240,0:17:37.900
It is the landing point.

0:17:37.900,0:17:42.920
He will land before talking to you.

0:17:42.920,0:17:46.480
You don't hear the voice of God here.

0:17:46.480,0:17:55.360
Someone will say, "I can hear this; God says this, that" - no, God doesn't say here.

0:17:55.360,0:18:03.820
Here, our heart - contact point, communication point.

0:18:03.820,0:18:14.580
Our heart is the prayer room; our heart is the altar.

0:18:14.580,0:18:26.660
Constantly pray in your heart in hymns and spiritual songs.

0:18:26.660,0:18:28.000
What is a hymn?

0:18:28.000,0:18:34.260
I have given you; you have hymns, songs...

0:18:34.260,0:18:40.540
All the way to Calvary He went for me...

0:18:40.540,0:18:45.040
In your heart.

0:18:45.040,0:18:49.100
If your heart is talking, your lips should not move.

0:18:49.100,0:18:54.720
Keep busy with that - there are many songs for you.

0:18:54.720,0:19:00.980
You drop that after a while, "Locate me in Your mercy, Lord" - in your heart.

0:19:00.980,0:19:05.980
After a while you drop that, say "Take more of me, give me more of You".

0:19:05.980,0:19:13.600
This is the route to God, the channel to God.

0:19:13.600,0:19:25.740
Your contribution to others – see it as an assignment from God.

0:19:25.740,0:19:30.420
Whatever you give, see it as an assignment from God.

0:19:30.420,0:19:40.520
Whatever you do, "Excuse me, can I help you? OK, thank you" - see it as an assignment from God.

0:19:40.520,0:19:44.840
Failing them is failing God.

0:19:44.840,0:19:50.060
When you see it as an assignment from God, you will not wait to receive reward.

0:19:50.060,0:19:56.380
Tomorrow you meet the person you helped, you will now begin to say, "Look at this woman I helped;

0:19:56.380,0:20:03.620
she didn't even greet me - see her. Madam, you don't know me?

0:20:03.620,0:20:09.360
I was the one who helped you yesterday. You can't even say 'thank you.'"

0:20:09.360,0:20:13.740
If it was an assignment from God, you would not wait for the reward.

0:20:13.740,0:20:17.100
See it as an assignment from God.

0:20:17.100,0:20:22.900
Once you do that, God will reward you; God is the Rewarder.

0:20:22.900,0:20:32.540
God is so much concerned about little.

0:20:32.540,0:20:39.280
That is why He was watching the poor widow.

0:20:39.280,0:20:44.720
God is so much concerned about your little possessions.

0:20:44.720,0:20:47.980
He wants you to grow.

How can you grow when you are not part with others?

0:20:54.000,0:21:01.660
Whatever you give out of little, it means so much.

0:21:01.660,0:21:07.240
It is easy to part with little than much.

0:21:07.240,0:21:16.960
The rich cannot give what their life depends on

0:21:16.960,0:21:24.700
but the poor give what their life depends on, no matter how little.

0:21:24.700,0:21:30.440
So, there is no excuse now that you have little – that is the best time to give.

0:21:30.440,0:21:31.260
Tell your neighbour,

0:21:31.260,0:21:34.340
little...

0:21:34.340,0:21:35.000
Ask your neighbour,

0:21:35.000,0:21:37.160
You have little?

0:21:37.160,0:21:48.920
God is so much concerned about your little possessions because He wants you to grow.

0:21:48.920,0:21:53.140
When you part with little, consider it as an assignment from God.

0:21:53.140,0:22:01.220
Don’t accept someone coming to you to thank you; it will affect your gift.

0:22:01.220,0:22:05.740
Someone would say, "Thank you very much for what you have given me yesterday" -

0:22:05.740,0:22:08.120
it will affect what you have given him.

0:22:08.120,0:22:10.900
If somebody comes to you and says, "I want to thank you

0:22:10.900,0:22:13.840
for what you have given me yesterday - it really helped",

0:22:13.840,0:22:21.380
"Ha! I want to thank you for receiving it."

Because you are reshaping your destiny.

0:22:31.720,0:22:42.320
Thanking people after a gift is a "culture", it is a tradition, but spiritually, it has a comma.

I want to leave you here.
Thank you.
