0:00:00.000,0:00:06.320
Your heart is God’s room, not sitting room.

0:00:06.320,0:00:20.360
“Your heart is God’s room” means “Your heart is prayer room”, not sitting room.

0:00:20.360,0:00:30.120
“Your heart is God’s room” means “God’s prayer room”.

0:00:30.120,0:00:33.100
What are you doing with your heart?

0:00:33.100,0:00:38.180
Have you forgiven those who have sinned against you?

0:00:38.180,0:00:41.080
What are you holding?

0:00:41.080,0:00:55.140
Is your heart imprisoned – pain of the past, envy and jealousy?

0:00:55.140,0:01:09.440
If your heart is not free, there is no place for God because your heart is God's room.

0:01:09.440,0:01:15.120
You have the opportunity, grace now before we begin to pray.

0:01:15.120,0:01:17.940
You can begin to reconcile now.

0:01:17.940,0:01:26.880
Say to yourself, “I mean it”.

0:01:26.880,0:01:41.400
Whether you are right or wrong – someone wronged you – you have no right to hold offence.

0:01:41.400,0:01:51.660
If you hold a grudge against your brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:01:51.660,0:01:56.520
A grudge against a brother - whether you are right...

0:01:56.520,0:02:04.800
You were intentionally cheated for a reason not known to you...

0:02:04.800,0:02:13.440
Viewers all over the world, we cannot pray without the Holy Ghost.

0:02:13.440,0:02:17.300
You must know where you belong before we pray.

0:02:17.300,0:02:18.700
Where do I belong?

0:02:18.700,0:02:22.020
I know where I belong.

0:02:22.020,0:02:32.640
I belong to the presence of God because in His presence, you are strong, content, satisfied.

0:02:38.560,0:02:45.020
Right now, begin to reconcile yourself.

0:02:45.020,0:02:52.960
Begin to forgive and forget.

0:02:52.960,0:02:57.340
Forgive me as I forgive those who sin against me.

0:02:57.340,0:02:59.940
In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.

0:02:59.940,0:03:02.480
(Amen.)

0:03:02.480,0:03:06.200
You must mean it.

0:03:06.200,0:03:18.640
You must allow your heart to speak for you because the real thing about you is your heart.

0:03:18.640,0:03:21.480
Your spirit, your heart is the real thing.

0:03:21.480,0:03:22.980
Allow your heart to speak for you.

0:03:22.980,0:03:25.040
Mean it with all your heart.

0:03:25.040,0:03:26.940
In Jesus’ name, we pray.

0:03:26.940,0:03:28.860
(Amen.)

0:03:28.860,0:03:32.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:32.100,0:03:41.760
Those of us that are still wrestling with our past, pain of the past, offence in the past,

0:03:41.760,0:03:46.060
I pray you will be released, in the name of Jesus.

0:03:46.060,0:03:48.860
(Amen!)

0:03:48.860,0:03:50.540
Be released, in the name of Jesus.

0:03:50.540,0:03:53.620
(Amen!)

0:03:53.620,0:04:00.020
You are not here to meet a man but you are here to meet God.

0:04:00.020,0:04:04.100
God is not a man.

0:04:04.100,0:04:06.560
In Jesus’ name, you are released.

0:04:06.560,0:04:08.600
(Amen.)

0:04:08.600,0:04:10.440
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:10.440,0:04:14.120
(Amen!)

0:04:14.120,0:04:16.900
From the pain of the past, be released in the name of Jesus.

0:04:16.900,0:04:21.380
(Amen!)

0:04:21.380,0:04:23.800
From that bitterness, be released, in the name of Jesus.

0:04:23.800,0:04:28.720
(Amen!)

0:04:28.720,0:04:35.680
Be released, in the name of Jesus.
(Amen!)

0:04:35.680,0:04:47.820
Viewers, I lay my hand upon you, to release you from that pain of the past.

0:04:47.820,0:04:49.520
(Amen!)

0:04:49.520,0:04:51.520
I lay my hand upon you.

0:04:51.520,0:04:54.560
Be released, in the name of Jesus!
(Amen!)

0:04:54.560,0:05:00.700
Pain of the past, be released, in the name of Jesus!
(Amen!)

0:05:00.700,0:05:03.700
Receive that nature of God, in the name of Jesus.

0:05:03.700,0:05:08.320
(Amen!)

0:05:08.320,0:05:11.900
In Jesus Christ's name.
(Amen!)

0:05:11.900,0:05:14.160
Amen.
(Amen.)

0:05:14.160,0:05:17.640
I want to believe you are released.

0:05:17.640,0:05:22.440
Will you believe with me?

0:05:22.440,0:05:25.400
You can be seated.

0:05:25.400,0:05:37.360
Since you believe with me - two believers are better than one, if they are one.

0:05:37.360,0:05:42.960
Since you believe with me that you are released, you are released.

0:05:42.960,0:05:44.620
(Amen.)

0:05:44.620,0:05:48.240
Now, you can sense God’s presence.

0:05:48.240,0:05:49.640
(Amen.)

0:05:49.640,0:05:51.620
Are you sensing God’s presence?

0:05:51.620,0:05:53.120
(Yes.)

0:05:53.120,0:05:58.400
It is your time to meet the Lord.

0:05:58.400,0:06:03.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:03.780,0:06:06.020
Hallelujah.

0:06:06.020,0:06:12.460
As we move, the Spirit releases His message.

0:06:12.460,0:06:19.660
These are faith words that will build you, not just counsel.

0:06:19.660,0:06:21.900
Hallelujah.
(Amen.)

0:06:21.900,0:06:29.280
When we say, “I am a faith man”, many of us don’t know what it means.

0:06:29.280,0:06:33.220
We just hear people saying, "I'm a faith man; I'm a faith woman."

0:06:33.220,0:06:39.200
What does it mean to you to say, “I’m a faith man; I’m a faith woman”?

0:06:39.200,0:06:43.680
That is our name as Christians - "I'm a man of faith."

0:06:43.680,0:06:49.240
You shouldn't call yourself a "faith woman" when you don't know what it means.

0:06:49.240,0:06:53.060
It means I trust in God with all my faith.

0:06:53.060,0:06:56.200
I'm a "faith woman"... - women, can somebody talk here?

0:06:56.200,0:07:00.780
To believe the Word of God...

0:07:00.780,0:07:10.340
When we say, “I am a faith man”, it means you use faith words and produce faith results.

0:07:10.340,0:07:11.360
That is it.

0:07:11.360,0:07:13.960
You use faith words.

0:07:13.960,0:07:16.900
Do you know what it means to use faith words?

0:07:16.900,0:07:23.640
If I say I am a faith man, I am using faith words to produce faith results.

0:07:23.640,0:07:29.360
If it does not produce faith results, it means my faith is faith in faith,

0:07:29.360,0:07:33.080
not faith in the finished works of our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:07:33.080,0:07:36.640
What do I mean by the language of the Bible?

0:07:36.640,0:07:49.960
That is the language God used to create and to save us, to heal, to bless, to judge and to rule over us.

0:07:49.960,0:07:52.700
That is the language of the Bible.

0:07:52.700,0:08:01.180
The language of today is the language we use every time out there, to gossip, give instruction,

0:08:01.180,0:08:05.500
"Do this! You can do this!" - you don't mind what you say;

0:08:05.500,0:08:10.460
to talk to your children, "Please, you are stupid. Come here",

0:08:10.460,0:08:18.060
to sing songs - anybody can sing songs, even gospel songs, not even being a Christian,

0:08:18.060,0:08:21.880
to tell stories - this is the language of today,

0:08:21.880,0:08:30.100
to do business - you have a lot of fake business cards - stories, telling lies,

0:08:30.100,0:08:33.720
to do politics of today.

0:08:33.720,0:08:36.000
That is the language of today.

0:08:36.000,0:08:39.740
When you now say, “I’m a faith man” or “I’m a faith woman”,

0:08:39.740,0:08:46.040
it means you use faith words and produce faith results.
