0:00:00.000,0:00:03.080
Evangelist, please help my husband!

0:00:03.080,0:00:07.980
He has lumbar spondylitis and osteoarthritis.

0:00:07.980,0:00:09.360
He cannot walk.

0:00:09.360,0:00:12.320
He cannot lift any heavy object.

0:00:12.320,0:00:14.320
He cannot sit well.

0:00:14.320,0:00:18.040
He cannot do anything. I am the one assisting him.

0:00:18.040,0:00:19.920
He is using a lumbar corset.

0:00:19.920,0:00:22.520
Please, Evangelist, help my husband.

0:00:22.520,0:00:27.700
Even if he takes some drugs, after one hour, the pain becomes severe.

0:00:27.700,0:00:31.840
Please, help my husband. I know this is our last bus stop.

0:00:31.840,0:00:36.820
Evangelist, please help me. I cannot walk.

0:00:36.820,0:00:41.480
This pain is much. I have severe pain in my back and legs.

0:00:41.480,0:00:45.280
I have severe hotness all over my body.

0:00:45.280,0:00:53.060
If I take drugs, they will only work for one or two hours but afterwards, the pain would increase.

0:00:53.060,0:00:55.520
Please, Evangelist, help me.

0:00:55.520,0:00:58.500
It is my wife that has been helping me with everything.

0:00:58.500,0:01:02.440
I cannot walk. Please, Evangelist, help me.

0:01:02.440,0:01:05.820
What do you want God Almighty to do for you today?

0:01:05.820,0:01:10.720
I want our Lord Jesus Christ to save and heal me.

0:01:10.720,0:01:14.040
Evangelist, please. I know this is my last bus stop.

0:01:14.040,0:01:15.620
God will heal me.

0:01:15.620,0:01:18.100
Jesus Christ will save me from this problem.

0:01:18.100,0:01:19.300
Amen.

0:01:19.300,0:01:20.840
Yes, Amen.

0:01:20.840,0:01:29.540

Sir, walk in the name of Jesus!

0:03:17.660,0:03:19.660
Hallelujah!

0:03:19.660,0:03:22.420
Healed Through The New Morning Water In Jesus' Name

0:03:22.420,0:03:32.000
Thank You, Jesus! I can walk!

0:03:32.000,0:03:37.660
Thank You, Jesus!

0:03:37.660,0:03:46.780
TESTIMONY TIME

0:03:46.780,0:03:51.800
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:03:51.800,0:03:56.860
Wow. We can already see the joy of the Lord in the face of our father!

0:03:56.860,0:04:11.360
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:11.360,0:04:13.940
Our God is good!

0:04:13.940,0:04:16.980
All the time!

0:04:16.980,0:04:22.460
My name is Mr Monday Ishaka.

0:04:22.460,0:04:26.500
I am 62 years old.

0:04:26.500,0:04:30.220
I am from Delta State, Nigeria.

0:04:30.220,0:04:31.900
Thank You, Lord.

0:04:31.900,0:04:39.200
The person standing beside me is my lovely wife - Mrs Vera O. Ishaka.

0:04:39.200,0:04:43.840
The unbeatable wager of every calamity!

0:04:43.840,0:04:46.860
Thank You, Jesus!

0:04:46.860,0:04:48.680
Thank You, Lord!

0:04:48.680,0:04:50.900
Sir, we want to hear your wonderful testimony.

0:04:50.900,0:04:56.680
Can you first of all share with us more about the problems that brought you here to The SCOAN.

0:04:56.680,0:04:57.840
Fine.

0:04:57.840,0:05:05.620
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a sickness

0:05:05.620,0:05:15.400
they call lumbar spondylosis and osteoarthritis.

0:05:15.400,0:05:21.720
I could not walk and was using a lumbar corset.

0:05:21.720,0:05:25.400
I came with an inability to walk.

0:05:25.400,0:05:34.940
I had a severe pain all over my back and to make things worse, I had a hotness in my waist

0:05:34.940,0:05:39.000
that at the worst of times, I could not withstand the heat.

0:05:39.000,0:05:46.680
I would cry to God asking Him to come and deliver me from all these problems.

0:05:46.680,0:05:52.940
I was given a series of drugs to take.

0:05:52.940,0:06:05.460
I was tired of drugs of which I told my wife, that let the will of God be done.

0:06:05.460,0:06:08.200
I knew that God would not disappoint me.

0:06:08.200,0:06:10.560
I decided to run to God of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:06:10.560,0:06:13.660
knowing that He was the only one who could set me free from my problem.

0:06:13.660,0:06:14.880
Thank You, Lord.

0:06:14.880,0:06:19.000
Amen. So with that faith, you came to The SCOAN last week.

0:06:19.000,0:06:21.260
Can you describe what happened to you, sir,

0:06:21.260,0:06:25.520
as the New Morning Water was ministered to you in the name of Jesus?

0:06:25.520,0:06:34.660
Last week, as you saw in the clip, I was brought in a vehicle.

0:06:34.660,0:06:38.000
The pain I experienced was very severe.

0:06:38.000,0:06:44.460
The evangelists came round to minister the Morning Water on me after asking me about my problem.

0:06:44.460,0:06:46.280
I told them everything.

0:06:46.280,0:06:57.840
They then asked me if I believed in the Morning Water to which I replied, Yes, that that was why I was here.

0:06:57.840,0:07:08.120
As the Morning Water was ministered to me, I felt a hot sensation all over my body

0:07:08.120,0:07:17.060
and saw something like a being coming out of my body.

0:07:17.060,0:07:27.600
Immediately it came out of my body, I started vomiting poisonous substances.

0:07:27.600,0:07:35.320
After that, the evangelist instructed me to rise up and walk.

0:07:35.320,0:07:42.580
I then stood up and started walking and jumping.

0:07:42.580,0:07:45.420
I started glorifying the God of T.B. Joshua!

0:07:45.420,0:07:51.300
Thank You, Jesus!

0:07:51.300,0:07:54.460
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

0:07:54.460,0:07:58.360
So once again, sir, tell us - ever since that encounter - it has been one week now -

0:07:58.360,0:08:00.740
what are the changes that you have seen in your life?

0:08:00.740,0:08:02.560
Oh my God!

0:08:02.560,0:08:16.100
After a week, just by looking at me, one can tell that I am fit to carry out any job I want to do.

0:08:16.100,0:08:21.800
Since then, you can see me - I can walk, jump, demonstrate.

0:08:21.800,0:08:28.580
I can bend, stoop, anything at all that you want me to do - I can do it for you.

0:08:28.580,0:08:35.280
Because I know that God has given me the glory of being in His house!

0:08:35.280,0:08:36.980
I love God so much!

0:08:36.980,0:08:39.900
Just give me a second.

0:08:39.900,0:08:45.800
Let me demonstrate for the Almighty God so that the glory of Prophet T.B. Joshua...

0:08:45.800,0:08:48.780
Oh God, you are worthy of my praise!

0:08:48.780,0:08:51.960
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

0:08:51.960,0:08:57.660
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:57.660,0:08:59.840
Wow. Indeed, actions speak louder.

0:08:59.840,0:09:03.980
We can see our father is completely restored to the glory of God.

0:09:03.980,0:09:07.800
Sir, what is your advice to our viewers concerning this New Morning Water

0:09:07.800,0:09:10.860
that God used to heal you and set you free?

0:09:10.860,0:09:12.560
Thank you.

0:09:12.560,0:09:26.320
My advice to viewers all over the world, when you are in a situation like I passed through in life,

0:09:26.320,0:09:30.140
don't cry; just believe in God.

0:09:30.140,0:09:38.040
At the accepted time, God will set you free as He has set me free today, in Jesus' name.

0:09:38.040,0:09:39.620
Amen.

0:09:39.620,0:09:41.840
Amen. That's a wonderful word of advice.

0:09:41.840,0:09:45.640
Sir, the lumbar corset - you mean you have no need of it right now?

0:09:45.640,0:09:51.840
This lumbar corset, I don't need it anymore! I throw it away to the glory of God.

0:09:51.840,0:09:55.420
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

0:09:55.420,0:09:57.420
Amen. Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:09:57.420,0:09:59.960
That's just hear a quick word from your wife as well.

0:09:59.960,0:10:07.320
My name is Mrs Vera Ishaka from Delta State, Nigeria.

0:10:07.320,0:10:11.500
Could you explain to us about the condition that your husband was in before?

0:10:11.500,0:10:20.660
He was having lumbar spondylosis and osteoarthritis, severe back and waist pain,

0:10:20.660,0:10:28.640
inability to lift any heavy object. He could not walk or do anything on his own.

0:10:28.640,0:10:35.940
I used to assist him as a wife and the burden was so much on me - running my business,

0:10:35.940,0:10:40.380
running the home, going everywhere - it was hell then.

0:10:40.380,0:10:48.040
When I came with him, inside the vehicle as you have seen, when I cried out to the evangelist

0:10:48.040,0:10:56.120
to help my husband, the evangelist started ministering the Morning Water on him.

0:10:56.120,0:11:01.140
That is his own experience - that he has changed.

0:11:01.140,0:11:11.480
It happened to him practically but I was there. What I saw was unbelievable.

0:11:11.480,0:11:17.800
I saw him coming out like a new born baby learning how to walk.

0:11:17.800,0:11:23.220
After some time, he started walking to the glory of God.

0:11:23.220,0:11:30.540
Since then, I don't need to bother myself anymore. I only perform my duties as a wife.

0:11:30.540,0:11:32.780
He takes care of himself.

0:11:32.780,0:11:36.580
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:11:36.580,0:11:40.500
So our mother is saying that her husband is completely healed,

0:11:40.500,0:11:43.720
walking freely to the glory of God since that encounter.

0:11:43.720,0:11:47.260
On your own part, madam, what is your advice to our viewers

0:11:47.260,0:11:53.060
concerning the New Morning Water that God used to revive and restore your husband?

0:11:53.060,0:12:04.120
The New Morning Water, as you have seen, I say, Come, taste and see that miracles are real.

0:12:04.120,0:12:08.020
It is real - very real. I am a witness.

0:12:08.020,0:12:10.520
Hallelujah!

0:12:10.520,0:12:14.920
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
