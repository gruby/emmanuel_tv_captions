0:00:00.000,0:00:04.780
Those of you that have the Anointing Water, I want to minister it to you

0:00:04.780,0:00:06.780
to let you know what you are having.

0:00:06.780,0:00:09.180
Can you open it?

0:00:09.180,0:00:15.080
Raise it up, and stand up.

0:00:15.080,0:00:21.780
Blessed be the name of the Lord

0:00:21.780,0:00:30.840
He is worthy to be praised and adored

0:00:30.840,0:00:40.040
So we lift up holy hands in one accord

0:00:40.040,0:00:55.420
Singing blessed be the name

0:00:55.420,0:00:58.320
of the Lord.

0:00:58.320,0:01:03.520
You just stretch it forward for the
benefit of those who do not have the Anointing Water.

0:01:03.520,0:01:07.700
Whether you have it or not, all I know, once you spray it on the air now,

0:01:07.700,0:01:11.980
whether it fall on your clothes or body, it will catch fire.

0:01:17.020,0:01:23.360
Shout, Jesus!

0:01:23.360,0:01:26.420
Spray it in the air.

0:01:26.420,0:01:31.460
See what is happening.
People are falling one after another.

0:01:31.460,0:01:35.740
The anointing of God is flowing right now, see what is happening.

0:01:35.740,0:01:39.820
As he led them in prayer, and they began to spray the Anointing Water,

0:01:39.820,0:01:44.300
the mighty power of God fished out all the unclean spirits in their midst.

0:01:44.300,0:01:47.540
Say, In the name of Jesus.

0:01:47.540,0:01:56.800
Open your lips and spray it into your mouth.

0:01:56.800,0:01:59.440
Drink!

0:01:59.440,0:02:02.720
Open your lips.

0:02:02.720,0:02:04.260
Hallelujah!

0:02:04.260,0:02:06.620
Amen!

0:02:06.620,0:02:08.940
Whatever unclean spirit!

0:02:08.940,0:02:10.800
Out!

0:02:10.800,0:02:13.100
Whatever that causes you failure!

0:02:13.100,0:02:14.560
Out!

0:02:14.560,0:02:16.680
Whatever that causes you sickness!

0:02:16.680,0:02:17.920
Out!

0:02:17.920,0:02:20.080
Whatever causes you hardship!

0:02:20.080,0:02:21.140
Out!

0:02:21.140,0:02:23.200
Whatever that causes you barrenness!

0:02:23.200,0:02:24.060
Out!

0:02:24.060,0:02:26.440
Whatever that causes you nightmares!

0:02:26.440,0:02:33.720
Out!

0:02:33.720,0:02:36.640
Amen!

0:02:36.640,0:02:40.900
Face your neighbour and begin to command whatever sickness and spray it on your neighbour.

0:02:40.900,0:02:47.540
Command whatever sickness and disease. Prayer!

0:02:47.540,0:02:51.860
As they sprayed the Anointing Water towards their neighbours, many began to manifest

0:02:51.860,0:02:56.220
and shake uncontrollably. Truly God is at work.

0:02:56.220,0:03:00.340
Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.

0:03:00.340,0:03:05.720
As the evil spirits within them tried to escape, the power of God operating through the Anointing Water,

0:03:05.720,0:03:09.160
many rolled back and forth, others trembled.

0:03:09.160,0:03:13.960
Someone has coughed out this blood substance which was the root cause of their affliction.

0:03:13.960,0:03:19.960
The name of Jesus Christ is power and fire which makes satan and his agents tremble and flee.

0:03:19.960,0:03:22.460
Watch your screen and see what is happening.

0:03:22.460,0:03:25.140
See what is happening as they are spraying the Anointing Water.

0:03:25.140,0:03:29.740
Watch the screen of your television set and see what is happening in the midst of the people.

0:03:29.740,0:03:31.780
See an armed robber.

0:03:31.780,0:03:33.780
Watch your screen and see what is happening.

0:03:33.780,0:03:36.580
Amen.

0:03:36.580,0:03:40.100
I'm an armed robber and a cultist.

0:03:40.100,0:03:41.300
I took a blood oath.

0:03:41.300,0:03:42.600
You are what?

0:03:42.600,0:03:45.960
I'm an armed robber and a cultist.

0:03:45.960,0:03:51.860
As the prayer continues, this man who is an armed robber and a cultist is fished out.

0:03:51.860,0:03:56.120
And the evil spirit within him is forced to confess.

0:03:56.120,0:03:58.160
Spray the Anointing Water and see.

0:03:58.160,0:04:04.120
Watch your screen!

0:04:04.120,0:04:06.500
The brother says he is an armed robber and a cultist.

0:04:06.500,0:04:10.720
The man of God instructed people among the congregation to spray the Anointing Water

0:04:10.720,0:04:14.800
towards the man who confessed to be an armed robber and cultist.

0:04:14.800,0:04:20.140
Unable to stand the mighty power of God, he rolled back and forth on the floor.

0:04:20.140,0:04:26.020
Feeling uneasy due to the fire of the Holy Ghost, he began to pull off his clothes.

0:04:26.020,0:04:38.600
The fire is clearly too much for him, and he tried with all of his might to put out the invisible flames.

0:04:38.600,0:04:42.080
Who has Anointing Water?  Ok, come here!

0:04:42.080,0:04:45.760
Tell him to stand up and answer.

0:04:45.760,0:04:52.740
Stand up and answer, in Jesus' name!

0:04:52.740,0:04:54.740
Hallelujah!

0:05:00.120,0:05:05.720
Look! Tell him to do like this.

0:05:05.720,0:05:18.960
Jump up, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:18.960,0:05:23.860
At the instruction of the man of God, he commanded the exposed armed robber and cultist

0:05:23.860,0:05:28.640
to jump in the name of Jesus Christ; and the man was forced to jump.

0:05:28.640,0:05:33.140
In the name of Jesus, I command you to jump and talk.

0:05:33.140,0:05:37.940
You can see. These are the people terrorising us out there.

0:05:37.940,0:05:41.320
He said that he is an armed robber and cultist. You can see what the power of God can do.

0:05:41.320,0:05:44.340
Ask him to stand up again.

0:05:44.340,0:05:47.380
Stand up, in the name of Jesus! I command you to stand up in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:47.380,0:05:48.600
Tell him to jump!

0:05:48.600,0:05:49.620
Stand up!

0:05:49.620,0:05:50.520
He shall jump up!

0:05:50.520,0:05:54.960
Put your hand on your ear and jump up! In the mighty name of Jesus, jump!

0:05:54.960,0:06:00.620
Jump, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:06:00.620,0:06:03.100
Amen!

0:06:03.100,0:06:04.800
It's alright.

0:06:04.800,0:06:06.340
Tell him to go and sit down.

0:06:06.340,0:06:09.120
Come back!

0:06:09.120,0:06:18.900
Come back, in the name of Jesus.  I command you to come back, in the name of Jesus!

0:06:18.900,0:06:20.320
Tell him to sit down.

0:06:20.320,0:06:24.480
Sit down on the floor, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:06:24.480,0:06:29.840
My name is Christian, and I am 25 years old.

0:06:29.840,0:06:33.240
I am a cultist and also an armed robber.

0:06:33.240,0:06:39.580
In 2008, when I travelled outside the country, I was deported.

0:06:39.580,0:06:43.400
It left me with nothing, causing me to roam about in the streets.

0:06:43.400,0:06:47.940
I started smoking Indian hemp and moving with bad guys.

0:06:47.940,0:06:54.920
What really motivated me to join the cult is the way they lavish money.

0:06:54.920,0:06:58.180
They can eat a hundred thousand naira at a go.

0:06:58.180,0:07:03.220
I asked my friend to put me through so that I would belong to the cult.

0:07:03.220,0:07:07.700
He asked me if I was willing to keep to the rules. I told him that I was willing to do anything.

0:07:07.700,0:07:11.300
He then told me to come back and see him in 3 days. I called him

0:07:11.300,0:07:14.680
and he said he was going to take me to our leader.

0:07:14.680,0:07:20.840
After two weeks, they called me and I went to see them.

0:07:20.840,0:07:25.340
They took me to the forest and asked me to take off my clothes, which I did.

0:07:25.340,0:07:30.800
They told me to raise my hands. They tied my hands and asked me to lie down.

0:07:30.800,0:07:35.400
There were 10 of them and they lashed me 25 strokes of machete drilling.

0:07:35.400,0:07:39.040
They also used a razor blade to cut my left hand.

0:07:39.040,0:07:47.980
Then they asked me to take my blood and keep whatever we did there a secret.

0:07:47.980,0:07:49.800
I promised that I would keep everything a secret.

0:07:49.800,0:07:54.580
After one week, they called and said that there was a mission for us.

0:07:54.580,0:07:58.380
They brought out arms,
cutlasses and axes.

0:07:58.380,0:08:02.340
They gave me one tool to carry out
the mission with them.

0:08:02.340,0:08:05.140
Then we went and it was successful and we came back

0:08:05.140,0:08:08.440
After three days they called me
for another mission.

0:08:08.440,0:08:11.940
On our way, the police took us unawares.

0:08:11.940,0:08:14.740
They shot two of our guys who were instantly dead.

0:08:14.740,0:08:19.960
I went to a herbalist for charms so that the bullets would not penetrate my body.

0:08:19.960,0:08:22.640
The herbalist did it for me.

0:08:22.640,0:08:25.560
They called us again for another mission,
in which we lost three souls.

0:08:25.560,0:08:27.320
Six of us were left alive.

0:08:27.320,0:08:31.500
I have charms in my body which I use
for operations.

0:08:31.500,0:08:40.420
DELIVERANCE TIME

0:08:40.420,0:08:45.760
This is Christian, the armed robber and cultist who is now receiving deliverance

0:08:45.760,0:08:50.520
in the power of the Holy Spirit, after he has given his confession.

0:08:50.520,0:08:54.140
You are delivered, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:08:54.140,0:08:59.420
Hallelujah!

0:08:59.420,0:09:05.060
