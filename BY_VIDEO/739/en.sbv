0:00:00.000,0:00:00.860
Hallelujah!

0:00:00.860,0:00:03.980
Viewers, thank you for your time.

0:00:03.980,0:00:06.940
God's time is the best.

0:00:06.940,0:00:11.480
I want to rejoice with you because the atmosphere is of God.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:17.400,0:00:24.760
All you need is to meditate on the testimonies you have been hearing since morning.

0:00:24.760,0:00:28.520
A lot of testimonies, that is God's work.

0:00:28.520,0:00:31.940
Meditate on the Word.

0:00:31.940,0:00:41.880
The more you meditate on the Word, the more your spirit - heart - acts upon the Word.

0:00:41.880,0:00:54.100
When the Word dominates our heart, it influences our character and our conduct.

0:00:54.100,0:01:01.680
The testimony of this, the testimony of that - they all point to salvation.

0:01:01.680,0:01:17.180
The more you meditate on the Word - testimonies - the more your heart acts upon the Word.

0:01:17.180,0:01:29.180
And when we allow all these to influence us, it leads to good character and conduct.

0:01:29.180,0:01:34.100
When all what you have been seeing since morning, hearing since morning,

0:01:34.100,0:01:37.900
the message the evangelist delivered here today...

0:01:37.900,0:01:47.920
If you allow all these to dominate your heart, it will influence your conduct and your character.

0:01:47.920,0:01:52.740
When you leave here today, you will just find yourself behaving in a different way.

0:01:52.740,0:01:55.760
No longer the way you were behaving before.

0:01:55.760,0:02:00.140
You are a smoker, you find yourself no longer smoking.

0:02:00.140,0:02:04.480
You talk too much,  you just find yourself....

0:02:04.480,0:02:07.880
We are all waiting for something.

0:02:07.880,0:02:21.760
When healing, anointing is present, we put a demand through our faith.

0:02:21.760,0:02:25.760
But there is healing, anointing everywhere.

0:02:25.760,0:02:29.080
This is why you can dance, you are happy since morning.

0:02:29.080,0:02:32.760
Those who have diabetes, they can't feel it any longer.

0:02:32.760,0:02:36.360
Hypertension is suddenly gone.

0:02:36.360,0:02:41.860
You have been dancing, these are the things you cannot do at home without taking a drug or tablet.

0:02:41.860,0:02:42.680
But you have been...

0:02:42.680,0:02:49.060
There is something!

0:02:49.060,0:02:52.560
There is something ... what is that something?

0:02:52.560,0:02:54.840
Oh, my God.

0:02:54.840,0:02:59.000
For you to suddenly have that faith that there is something you cannot see.

0:02:59.000,0:03:02.680
You have not seen, you don't know that something but because of your faith,

0:03:02.680,0:03:05.280
you believe there is something!

0:03:05.280,0:03:07.280
That is faith.

0:03:07.280,0:03:12.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:12.520,0:03:17.880
Faith is expecting God to do what He promised to do.

0:03:17.880,0:03:19.460
That is faith!

0:03:19.460,0:03:21.380
I saw you when you were going round.

0:03:21.380,0:03:22.660
There is something..

0:03:22.660,0:03:25.060
When you look, you can't see that something.

0:03:25.060,0:03:28.300
There is something. What is that; where is that something?

0:03:28.300,0:03:32.880
And yet you have not seen that something - because you believe!

0:03:32.880,0:03:35.160
Faith, that is faith.

0:03:35.160,0:03:40.620
So, here we have healing anointing.

0:03:40.620,0:03:42.480
I can feel it.

0:03:42.480,0:03:47.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:47.300,0:03:54.880
So, when healing anointing, I mean healing virtues, is present in a place -

0:03:54.880,0:04:00.380
through our faith, we put a demand on the anointing.

0:04:00.380,0:04:15.920
Miracles and all of God's blessings come by putting a demand on the anointing through our faith.

0:04:15.920,0:04:24.160
The anointing is everywhere; it is more than sufficient.

0:04:24.160,0:04:32.100
So what you are demanding - it is more than enough.

0:04:32.100,0:04:35.240
Faith is a trust. Say it to your neighbour.

0:04:35.240,0:04:36.700
Faith is a trust.

0:04:36.700,0:04:37.720
I can't hear you.

0:04:37.720,0:04:39.180
Faith is a trust.

0:04:39.180,0:04:40.080
Again.

0:04:40.080,0:04:41.360
Faith is a trust.

0:04:41.360,0:04:42.200
Again.

0:04:42.200,0:04:43.240
Faith is a trust.

0:04:43.240,0:04:53.720
This is why you need that trust - faith to put a demand on the anointing.

0:04:53.720,0:04:55.900
Anointing is the power of God.

0:04:55.900,0:04:58.880
Where there is God, there is power

0:04:58.880,0:05:00.940
Here God, here power.

0:05:00.940,0:05:03.580
When God smiles, power smiles.

0:05:03.580,0:05:06.140
When God walks, power walks.

0:05:06.140,0:05:09.100
When God sits, power sits.

0:05:09.100,0:05:12.620
When God looks, power looks.

0:05:12.620,0:05:14.560
So, power of God.

0:05:14.560,0:05:20.880
Without that faith, you cannot put a demand -

0:05:20.880,0:05:27.960
demand for healing, blessing, deliverance, salvation.

0:05:27.960,0:05:31.860
Just mention those things you demand for.

0:05:31.860,0:05:37.320
You can now put a demand on what? On anointing; the power of God.

0:05:37.320,0:05:38.680
There is no other means.

0:05:38.680,0:05:45.880
this is why the Bible says: Only faith pleases Him.

0:05:45.880,0:05:48.640
Only faith pleases him.

0:05:48.640,0:06:01.140
[Song: Trust and Obey]

0:06:01.140,0:06:07.220
Only faith pleases Him. Nothing else!

0:06:07.220,0:06:14.180
And there is so much stress when you talk of faith.

0:06:14.180,0:06:20.260
People begin to say, "Ah faith ...ah faith, I don't have faith". No no no!

0:06:20.260,0:06:24.960
No, faith is not something you look within.

0:06:24.960,0:06:29.260
It is simple. Just grab it this way.

0:06:29.260,0:06:38.320
When you realise that God is reliable, like many testimonies you heard today

0:06:38.320,0:06:42.820
and you are able to consult, meet them to ask them what are you saying

0:06:42.820,0:06:47.780
and you are able to establish your facts

0:06:47.780,0:06:52.480
and you realise that truly, what they are saying is true -

0:06:52.480,0:06:55.240
then, God is reliable.

0:06:55.240,0:07:05.040
And the moment you realise that God is reliable, faith grows simultaneously.

0:07:05.040,0:07:06.500
Like as you are sitting down.

0:07:06.500,0:07:09.640
Begin to meditate over what you have seen today.

0:07:09.640,0:07:12.120
Meditate on the message.

0:07:12.120,0:07:16.200
Begin to meditate, meditate, meditate.

0:07:16.200,0:07:27.640
And the more you meditate, the more your spirit - heart - acts upon the Word.

0:07:27.640,0:07:31.220
Begin to meditate in your heart.

0:07:31.220,0:07:38.840
Whatever you receive now, without maintenance, it is useless.

0:07:38.840,0:07:48.460
It's better not to ask for something you cannot maintain.

0:07:48.460,0:07:53.860
It's better not to receive something you cannot maintain

0:07:53.860,0:08:00.020
because it will expose you and put you in the hands of the enemy.

0:08:00.020,0:08:05.560
Those who know you to be this, suddenly later realise that you are zero.

0:08:05.560,0:08:07.660
They will make mockery of you.

0:08:07.660,0:08:15.400
It takes faith to maintain your position to the end.

0:08:15.400,0:08:23.580
The beauty of our achievement is when we no longer live and the achievement is still there.

0:08:23.580,0:08:31.600
Tell your neighbor: The beauty of our achievement, the glory of our achievement

0:08:31.600,0:08:35.480
is when we are no longer living but that achievement is still there,

0:08:35.480,0:08:42.460
lingering on in the eyes and ears of children yet unborn.

0:08:42.460,0:08:46.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:46.800,0:08:48.960
That is the beauty.

0:08:48.960,0:08:56.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:56.000,0:09:00.500
We are not necessarily being blessed by God because of today

0:09:00.500,0:09:04.020
but we are blessed because of tomorrow,

0:09:04.020,0:09:07.220
when we are no longer living.

0:09:07.220,0:09:14.180
Children yet unborn want to see things that can influence them to do right.

0:09:14.180,0:09:17.100
They say, "Ah, I want to be this... Ah, I want to be this".

0:09:17.100,0:09:21.160
"This person with such name lived such kind of life."

0:09:21.160,0:09:24.580
"This is what to achieve." - "No, no, I would love to be like him!"

0:09:24.580,0:09:29.080
It's not necessarily because of today you are blessed.

0:09:29.080,0:09:35.420
You are blessed because of tomorrow when you are no longer living

0:09:35.420,0:09:38.780
but that achievement continues to live

0:09:38.780,0:09:47.640
so that our children yet unborn can be influenced in a positive way by our achievement

0:09:47.640,0:09:53.400
because you will no longer live to educate them, to tell them the right way to follow.

0:09:53.400,0:09:58.780
But what you have achieved will be the one to talk to them, to tell them what to do.

0:09:58.780,0:10:06.800
Your concentration is so much on what you want to achieve - what you need.

0:10:06.800,0:10:08.600
That is your concentration.

0:10:08.600,0:10:11.500
Yes, you want to be this, you want to be that!

0:10:11.500,0:10:14.860
Vanity upon vanity.

0:10:14.860,0:10:25.480
We have so many role models - the good and the bad - in our family and community.

0:10:25.480,0:10:32.880
You have seen so many that are poor, that are suffering throughout their lives

0:10:32.880,0:10:36.480
and seen so many achieve great things.

0:10:36.480,0:10:41.720
You have seen so many that are living and those that are no longer living.

0:10:41.720,0:10:45.120
Which part are we following?

0:10:45.120,0:10:49.640
If you are known today and you are not known tomorrow, what is the value of it?

0:10:49.640,0:10:56.360
If your name is written today and your name vanishes tomorrow, what is the value?

0:10:56.360,0:11:02.640
Please, brethren, think about tomorrow.

0:11:02.640,0:11:07.760
Don't be deceived by the little you have.

0:11:07.760,0:11:09.740
Are you talking of marriage?

0:11:09.740,0:11:13.720
If you are thinking of the future - tomorrow - you would not rush.

0:11:13.720,0:11:17.040
You would not get married just like that without asking God

0:11:17.040,0:11:19.920
if this marriage will stand for tomorrow.

0:11:19.920,0:11:23.760
Many marriages will stand for today, but will not be able to stand for tomorrow.

0:11:23.760,0:11:28.440
Many businesses will stand today but will not be able to stand tommorow.

0:11:28.440,0:11:33.580
Many relationships will stand today but will not be able to stand tommorow.

0:11:33.580,0:11:40.760
But we should look for the One that will stand tomorrow because today is yours; tomorrow - God's.

0:11:40.760,0:11:46.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:46.460,0:11:50.740
Back to faith.

0:11:50.740,0:11:55.040
[MESSAGE TITLE:] FAITH IS MAINTENANCE

0:11:55.040,0:11:59.560
You will maintain your life when you live a life of faith.

0:11:59.560,0:12:08.400
You will be able to maintain your business, finances and health.

0:12:08.400,0:12:15.160
But to maintain this deliverance or whatever you receive from God - without faith, it is not possible.

0:12:15.160,0:12:23.600
That is why Jesus said, "I will make you fishers of men...fishers of men....fishers of men".

0:12:23.600,0:12:26.980
If you follow Him.

0:12:26.980,0:12:32.440
You can only follow Him by faith.

0:12:32.440,0:12:34.380
Now, let's define faith.

0:12:34.380,0:12:44.620
When faith comes, it influences our conduct and character.

0:12:44.620,0:12:46.280
Yes.

0:12:46.280,0:12:49.160
How does this faith come?

0:12:49.160,0:12:50.780
Let's think about it.

0:12:50.780,0:12:55.300
Because you read the Bible, if I now take you to the message in the Bible that says,

0:12:55.300,0:12:59.280
"Faith comes by hearing the Word of God and obey",

0:12:59.280,0:13:04.060
you will say, "Ah, I have been hearing, I have been obeying, what else again?"

0:13:04.060,0:13:07.080
I will not take you to that.

0:13:07.080,0:13:09.160
Let me take you in a very short way.

0:13:09.160,0:13:15.980
Because the one we are used to "Faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God" -

0:13:15.980,0:13:17.980
may be difficult for you.

0:13:17.980,0:13:20.000
Let me just take you in a short way.

0:13:20.000,0:13:21.600
I was talking of meditation.

0:13:21.600,0:13:23.800
Meditation is a thing of the heart.

0:13:23.800,0:13:28.880
Since you know that faith lives in your heart, start it now.

0:13:28.880,0:13:31.860
Begin to meditate.

0:13:31.860,0:13:34.500
Meditate what I'm saying,

0:13:34.500,0:13:37.060
what you have been seeing since morning,

0:13:37.060,0:13:39.000
the testimony of people.

0:13:39.000,0:13:41.320
i will not use the word 'think'.

0:13:41.320,0:13:44.880
I will leave the word 'think' for your situation.

0:13:44.880,0:13:47.760
We think about our situation.

0:13:47.760,0:13:50.720
What am I going to eat today?

0:13:50.720,0:13:55.060
How will I pay the money? The debt?

0:13:55.060,0:13:57.980
How will I get out of this mess?

0:13:57.980,0:14:01.140
How will I pay my house rent? That is 'think'.

0:14:01.140,0:14:07.200
I will leave the word 'think' for your situation.

0:14:07.200,0:14:11.500
The word 'meditation' is a visit to God.

0:14:11.500,0:14:13.900
Meditation comes from the heart.

0:14:13.900,0:14:22.640
Thinking, many times, comes from mental assent.

0:14:22.640,0:14:27.340
The more you meditate on them, on those things,

0:14:27.340,0:14:36.300
the more your spirit - heart - acts, agrees, joins.

0:14:36.300,0:14:38.500
It is our heart now that we need to work on.

0:14:38.600,0:14:44.400
Whatever you engage your heart with influences your character and conduct.

0:14:44.400,0:14:51.920
Whatever your heart engages on would influence your character and conduct.

0:14:51.920,0:15:00.920
Now, engage your heart over what you have seen today, the testimony of people,

0:15:00.920,0:15:06.960
the message you heard from the evangelist, when you watch emmanuel tv.

0:15:06.960,0:15:11.040
All what you are seeing, the message, the testimony - engage your heart.

0:15:11.040,0:15:16.380
Not thinking - engage your heart.

0:15:16.380,0:15:24.900
When you engage your heart, what you are seeing or hearing on Emmanuel TV

0:15:24.900,0:15:29.600
will begin to influence your conduct and character.

0:15:29.600,0:15:31.480
That is faith.
