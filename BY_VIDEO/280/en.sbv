As the evangelists continue to minister the anointing water to the congregation

0:00:05.400,0:00:09.660
the darkness in this woman's life was exposed by the light of God.

0:00:09.660,0:00:15.780
Try though it might, the demonic entity in her life could not withstand the power and armour of God,

0:00:15.780,0:00:17.740
working through the anointing water.

0:00:17.740,0:00:27.200
The Anointing Water Revival - Birmingham, UK

0:00:27.200,0:00:32.440
The woman was escorted to the front so that all could witness the power of Jesus' triumph

0:00:32.440,0:00:35.200
over the power of the devil in her life.

0:00:35.200,0:00:39.360
The battle between light and darkness was evident in the life of this woman,

0:00:39.360,0:00:45.820
as every chain that an enemy had used to draw her back was being broken, in the name above all names.

0:00:45.820,0:00:48.540
Watch how she received her freedom.

0:00:48.540,0:00:58.120
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ! You evil spirit - it's time for you to speak out - who are you?

0:00:58.120,0:00:59.380
You say what?

0:00:59.380,0:01:00.160
There are many of us.

0:01:00.160,0:01:01.920
How many?

0:01:01.920,0:01:03.180
Many.

0:01:03.180,0:01:05.800
You must speak. How many?

0:01:05.800,0:01:08.920
Forty.

0:01:08.920,0:01:11.760
Begin to name yourselves. Who is number one?

0:01:11.760,0:01:14.600
Madness.

0:01:14.600,0:01:17.060
What is the meaning of that?

0:01:17.060,0:01:23.520
I destroyed her brain and made her go crazy.

0:01:23.520,0:01:28.260
I made her mad.

0:01:28.260,0:01:30.580
Who is number two?

0:01:30.580,0:01:34.120
I still want to speak.

0:01:34.120,0:01:37.080
Speak out. What have you done to her, madness?

0:01:37.080,0:01:43.040
She sees a psychiatrist, right now.

0:01:43.040,0:01:46.100
I wanted them to lock her up for life.

0:01:46.100,0:01:48.520
Why do you want them to lock her up for life?

0:01:48.520,0:01:53.860
Because I have tried to kill her; she won’t die. I tried to make her kill herself.

0:01:53.860,0:01:56.760
How did you try to make her kill herself?

0:01:56.760,0:02:00.700
She overdoses – tablets.

0:02:00.700,0:02:03.040
I have told her to jump off buildings.

0:02:03.040,0:02:07.100
She won’t. She prays, that is the problem.

0:02:07.100,0:02:08.900
Someone keeps on protecting her.

0:02:08.900,0:02:11.260
Who keeps protecting her?

0:02:11.260,0:02:12.320
You know who it is.

0:02:12.320,0:02:13.500
Who? Tell us.

0:02:13.500,0:02:15.700
I’m not telling you.

0:02:15.700,0:02:17.680
I will not utter that name.

0:02:17.680,0:02:18.360
Which name?

0:02:18.360,0:02:20.540
I will not utter that name.

0:02:20.540,0:02:22.240
But it's the name she prays to.

0:02:22.240,0:02:26.000
You know the name.

0:02:26.000,0:02:28.100
Don't ask me.

0:02:28.100,0:02:35.380
Who is number two?

0:02:35.380,0:02:39.640
Lust, seduction.

0:02:39.640,0:02:44.840
How many powers do you have in her body?

0:02:44.840,0:02:45.980
Many.

0:02:45.980,0:02:52.240
Where are the powers in her body?

0:02:52.240,0:02:58.100
You spirit of lust and seduction - where are the powers in her body?

0:02:58.100,0:03:01.940
In her hips.

0:03:01.940,0:03:06.980
Explain the power in her hips

0:03:06.980,0:03:08.720
And in her breasts.

0:03:08.720,0:03:15.160
You said you had power in her hips and in her breasts. Explain the power in her hips!

0:03:15.160,0:03:22.140
I came in after her father abused her.

0:03:22.140,0:03:24.460
So, that was how I came in.

0:03:24.460,0:03:30.080
I said - the power in her hips - how does she use the power in her hips?

0:03:30.080,0:03:37.040
She doesn’t have to do much. She only has to stand there and men come to her.

0:03:37.040,0:03:40.140
So, once men see her hips, they are attracted to her?

0:03:40.140,0:03:44.520
That’s right. They just use her.

0:03:44.520,0:03:51.220
She doesn’t have any power except in her hips for men to destroy her.

0:03:51.220,0:03:55.900
They use her. I made them use her.

0:03:55.900,0:04:03.300
And then, that’s when it hurts and then she goes crazy.

0:04:03.300,0:04:08.980
That’s what I want. I want her to go crazy and lose her mind.

0:04:08.980,0:04:16.120
How do you use her as a spirit of lust?

0:04:16.120,0:04:18.980
Get off me. Leave me alone. Let me go.

0:04:18.980,0:04:23.820
I said, what do you use her to do as a spirit of lust. What are the things she does as a spirit of lust?

0:04:23.820,0:04:27.380
How does it push her?

0:04:27.380,0:04:33.000
That lust makes her live in sin.

0:04:33.000,0:04:39.800
No matter how hard she tries, if she has lust, then she is still living in sin.

0:04:39.800,0:04:43.720
You mean that anyone who is living in sin and in lust - you can operate in them?

0:04:43.720,0:04:47.720
Yes.

0:04:47.720,0:04:50.860
You demon, right now it is your time to leave this body.

0:04:50.860,0:04:54.320
You've made the greatest mistake by allowing her to come here.

0:04:54.320,0:04:56.900
However many you are, Jesus Christ is more than you.

0:04:56.900,0:05:02.260
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ - it is your time to leave, in Jesus' name!

0:05:02.260,0:05:07.180
Come out of this body, and set her free!

0:05:07.180,0:05:09.340
Come out of her in Jesus' name!

0:05:09.340,0:05:12.100
Everything not of Jesus Christ - come out!

0:05:12.100,0:05:15.920
You have no place in this body. She belongs to Jesus Christ.

0:05:15.920,0:05:19.780
This anointing water is sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua. You must leave.

0:05:19.780,0:05:22.200
Whether you like it or not, you must go.

0:05:22.200,0:05:27.500
You are going to where Jesus wants you to go, but you must leave her! Come out!

0:05:27.500,0:05:31.920
Come out of her! Out!

0:05:31.920,0:05:40.180
You must leave. Get out of this body! Get out! Leave her alone! Go, in Jesus' name!

I am just a bit dazed.

What just happened to you? Do you know what you were saying just now?

0:06:53.700,0:07:03.040
Not really. All I know is I felt the spray and from there, something came over me.

0:07:03.040,0:07:05.340

0:07:05.340,0:07:09.760

ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL IN BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM

0:07:34.020,0:07:36.020
ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL - TESTIMONY TIME

0:07:37.480,0:07:42.540
My name is Charlene. I am from Leicester - UK, originally born in Zimbabwe.

0:07:42.540,0:07:48.140
What was the problem that brought you to the Anointing Water Revival in Birmingham today?

0:07:48.140,0:08:00.480
I had constant torment, depression, chronic pain and sickness all the time.

0:08:00.480,0:08:07.040
I was in and out of the hospital with different illnesses, including mental health issues as well.

0:08:07.040,0:08:11.040
Can you explain the mental health issue you were having before?

0:08:11.040,0:08:19.420
Before – I had several issues - the impulse to cut myself, self-harm, suicide attempts.

0:08:19.420,0:08:27.660
I made several suicide attempts – overdoses and attempts like that.

0:08:27.660,0:08:29.020
Nasty stuff.

0:08:29.020,0:08:34.220
You said that you had suicidal thoughts, and you attempted suicide several times. Is that right?

0:08:34.220,0:08:35.240
Yes, that is right.

0:08:35.240,0:08:41.880
Constantly, I heard a voice telling me to kill myself. It nagged me.

0:08:41.880,0:08:45.940
If I was driving, it would say, “Drive into this wall”

0:08:45.940,0:08:50.620
or, “Go, jump off that building; you don’t deserve to live”.

0:08:50.620,0:08:53.580
It was a very negative voice.

0:08:53.580,0:08:56.760
Have you ever been hospitalized because of this problem?

0:08:56.760,0:08:58.200
Yes, I have.

0:08:58.200,0:09:03.080
I have been hospitalized, and I have seen a psychiatrist.

0:09:03.080,0:09:08.540
They tried their best in terms of treating me with medication.

0:09:08.540,0:09:12.360
I was on all the medication I needed to be on.

0:09:12.360,0:09:17.320
The medication and treatment - had that been able to put an end to the mental problem you were having?

0:09:17.320,0:09:18.640
No, not an end.

0:09:18.640,0:09:26.100
It just elevated my mood a bit.

0:09:26.100,0:09:28.400
It makes you feel a bit better.

0:09:28.400,0:09:30.140
It is just like a ...

0:09:30.140,0:09:36.060
The anti-psychotics worked really only for my mood but the problem didn't go away.

0:09:36.060,0:09:38.820
You mentioned that you made several suicide attempts.

0:09:38.820,0:09:41.360
Have you ever been hospitalized as a result of this?

0:09:41.360,0:09:44.480
Yes, many times.

0:09:44.480,0:09:48.660
I had been on life support in the past.

0:09:48.660,0:09:53.920
I had been in a coma because I attempted suicide.

0:09:53.920,0:09:58.340
I had to have my stomach pumped for the drugs to be taken out.

0:09:58.340,0:10:06.480
I was in hospital a couple of times, more than four times due to suicide attempts.

0:10:06.480,0:10:07.980
The last time was the worst.

0:10:07.980,0:10:13.840
I took about 60 tablets, 60 Tramadols.

0:10:13.840,0:10:18.820
I had a test that climbed to the scale of 3, which means I was clinically dead.

0:10:18.820,0:10:22.380
I was on life support and in a coma for a few days.

0:10:22.380,0:10:27.060
The doctors really thought I would die.

0:10:27.060,0:10:31.920
They left me on life support thinking that was it, they should just leave me

0:10:31.920,0:10:36.500
because I had stopped breathing for a few hours and they thought I would be brain-dead.

0:10:36.500,0:10:40.940
But somehow – it was God, really – I woke up.

0:10:40.940,0:10:46.780
A lot of people just die from brain damage but I woke up and I thank God for that.

0:10:46.780,0:10:49.080
They were shocked as well.

0:10:49.080,0:10:54.780
Amen. You said you were in a coma and on life support, you were clinically dead

0:10:54.780,0:10:58.620
but by the grace of God you came out of it. Is that right?

0:10:58.620,0:11:00.340
Yes, I did.

0:11:00.340,0:11:04.640
Is this what prompted you to seek for a solution from God Almighty?

0:11:04.640,0:11:11.980
I had always been a praying person but every time I tried to, there was a pattern.

0:11:11.980,0:11:16.280
Every time I tried to make my life right with God, I would get spiritual attacks.

0:11:16.280,0:11:18.840
I mean they are not just a ...

0:11:18.840,0:11:22.900
They had become physical as well.

0:11:22.900,0:11:31.840
One time, I got scratched in my eyes and couldn’t see for 48 hours.

0:11:31.840,0:11:37.740
Physical things like being thrown constantly around my room or my bed.

0:11:37.740,0:11:39.580
It was always a pattern.

0:11:39.580,0:11:44.620
When I started going to church and trying to live according to God’s will,

0:11:44.620,0:11:47.560
there were always issues that would come up.

0:11:47.560,0:11:53.220
I would start getting spiritual attacks, particularly with sickness.

0:11:53.220,0:11:59.380
What was it that was scratching your eyes and causing you to be thrown around the room?

0:11:59.380,0:12:04.940
It wasn’t just me; I have a sister as well. She got thrown up and down by it.

0:12:04.940,0:12:12.580
She called it a creature with goat’s legs and a weird face.

0:12:12.580,0:12:15.140
Could you see this creature?

0:12:15.140,0:12:23.580
I saw a shadow of it many times but she saw it.

0:12:23.580,0:12:28.000
But always, I felt it and it clawed me in my eyes.

0:12:28.000,0:12:33.040
Alright. You came to the Anointing Water Revival today with these challenges.

0:12:33.040,0:12:37.000
Can you tell us what happened when the Anointing Water was ministered to you?

0:12:37.000,0:12:42.220
When the Anointing Water was ministered, it felt stinging.

0:12:42.220,0:12:45.740
I just felt a sting and I felt like turning my head away.

0:12:45.740,0:12:50.980
I felt like leaving, like running away, basically.

0:12:50.980,0:12:54.680
I don’t know – that was not me because I was OK.

0:12:54.680,0:12:57.560
Something just came over me.

0:12:57.560,0:13:01.960
How did you feel at that time when the Anointing Water was being ministered to you?

0:13:01.960,0:13:08.620
It felt as if I was being stung by something; I just didn’t like it.

0:13:08.620,0:13:17.420
I wanted to go. It was as if something came over me; I wasn’t myself.

0:13:17.420,0:13:25.420
I was there but there was something inside of me that didn't like the Anointing Water.

0:13:25.420,0:13:31.880
At the end of the prayer - tell us what happened and how were you feeling.

0:13:31.880,0:13:37.480
After I came to back to my senses, I felt very light.

0:13:37.480,0:13:41.880
I feel like something has come out of me from deep inside.

0:13:41.880,0:13:48.320
I feel fresh air and that I can breathe now.

0:13:48.320,0:13:56.000
I actually enjoy breathing because it feels so good; praise God!

0:13:56.000,0:14:01.140
What do you believe Jesus Christ has done for you through the medium of the Anointing Water?

0:14:01.140,0:14:09.480
I believe Jesus Christ has shown immeasurable mercy to me

0:14:09.480,0:14:11.480
because of what I have been going through.

0:14:11.480,0:14:22.300
I have cried and cried in bed, asking Jesus why all that was happening to me all the time.

0:14:22.300,0:14:28.420
I would even say to Him, “I am so tired; I can’t wake up every morning like this”.

0:14:28.420,0:14:37.100
I would say to Him, “I know that suicide is a sin; I don’t want to go to hell.

0:14:37.100,0:14:44.380
If I die, I want to go and be with You, Jesus”. He answered my prayers.

0:14:44.380,0:14:46.680
Amen. Yes, the prayers of many years are not lost.

0:14:46.680,0:14:50.820
We thank God Almighty today for meeting you at the point of your need.

0:14:50.820,0:14:55.720
We thank God for shining the light of His life into your spirit, soul and body

0:14:55.720,0:15:01.740
and dispelling every shade of darkness in your spirit, in your soul, in your mind and in your body.

0:15:01.740,0:15:06.620
We encourage you to maintain this wonderful deliverance and a new life in Christ Jesus
