PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA

Thank you. Hallelujah!

0:00:06.440,0:00:08.440
PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
THE SCOAN

0:00:08.440,0:00:10.340
So, God has done it.

0:00:10.340,0:00:12.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:12.720,0:00:14.900
Thank You, Jesus.

0:00:14.900,0:00:17.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:17.120,0:00:18.900
Now you need to ask yourself:

0:00:18.900,0:00:22.860
Are you really the person God wants you to be?

0:00:22.860,0:00:24.020
Ask yourself.

0:00:24.020,0:00:29.960
Am I the person God wants me to be?

0:00:29.960,0:00:33.740
That is the question we need to ask. This is what I am going to talk about today.

0:00:33.740,0:00:38.840
One can be very rich and yet not what God wants him to be.

0:00:38.840,0:00:42.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:42.380,0:00:52.960
The reward of the person of God is the genuine peace of heart

0:00:52.960,0:01:00.900
and the legacy for generations.

0:01:00.900,0:01:04.540
Legacy lives for what? - Generations.

0:01:04.540,0:01:23.320
Can you see the two things: the genuine peace of heart and the legacy to live for generations.

0:01:23.320,0:01:25.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:25.840,0:01:38.740
One can be a prophet and yet not the person God wants him to be.

0:01:38.740,0:01:49.860
One can be a president of a nation, and yet not the person God wants him to be.

0:01:49.860,0:01:59.640
One can be the richest person in the world, yet not what God wants him to be.

0:01:59.640,0:02:02.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:02.540,0:02:03.980
Think about it.

0:02:03.980,0:02:14.000
How can somebody be the richest in the world and yet not what God wants him to be?

0:02:14.000,0:02:22.920
Because he or she lacks the genuine peace of heart

0:02:22.920,0:02:29.020
and such wealth cannot live for generations.

0:02:29.020,0:02:33.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:33.200,0:02:40.940
You can be a prophet or bishop and yet not what God wants you to be.

0:02:40.940,0:02:42.480
Hallelujah!

0:02:42.480,0:02:44.280
So the question you need to ask yourself:

0:02:44.280,0:02:51.560
Are you really the person God wants you to be?

0:02:51.560,0:02:56.400
How do we know what God wants us to be?

0:02:56.400,0:02:58.940
The answer has been given.

0:02:58.940,0:03:16.780
The first step to know our destiny - what God wants you to be - is to get to know God better.

0:03:16.780,0:03:18.580
We will talk about that today.

0:03:18.580,0:03:21.560
To get to know who? - God better.

0:03:21.560,0:03:27.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:27.100,0:03:32.980
We are not talking of religious conduct and behaviours.

0:03:32.980,0:03:40.400
where we are all actually coming from.

0:03:40.400,0:03:45.120
Tell your neighbour, "You need to know God better".

0:03:45.120,0:03:50.460
You need to get to know God better.

0:03:50.460,0:04:05.460
We Christians today claim we know God by confessing faith in the Word

0:04:05.460,0:04:10.480
and denying it in action.

0:04:10.480,0:04:13.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:13.840,0:04:18.080
You say, "I know God, God is .. .I am a born again Christian".

0:04:18.080,0:04:26.020
We confess faith in the Word but deny it in action.

0:04:26.020,0:04:30.200
This is why we need to know God better - to discover yourself.

0:04:30.200,0:04:33.240
You are what God says you are but you don't know.

0:04:33.240,0:04:36.900
You can do what God says you can do but you don't know.

0:04:36.900,0:04:42.200
You have what God says you have but you don't know.

0:04:42.200,0:04:48.960
If you know you have what God says you have and you can do what God says you can do

0:04:48.960,0:04:53.720
oh my God - the sky will be your limit.

0:04:53.720,0:05:02.820
You will not compare yourself to others; you will be content.

0:05:02.820,0:05:12.480
Confessing faith in the Word but denying it in action.

0:05:12.480,0:05:21.780
Trying to believe yet never acting on the Word.

0:05:21.780,0:05:24.460
I believe Jesus is Lord. Jesus this, Jesus that.

0:05:24.460,0:05:27.140
I'm just telling you your life style.

0:05:27.140,0:05:30.260
The kind of Christian you are.

0:05:30.260,0:05:32.300
This is why I say you need to know God better.

0:05:32.300,0:05:36.140
I'm just telling you, I'm just describing the kind of person you are.

0:05:36.140,0:05:39.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:39.100,0:05:55.280
Trying to believe yet never acting on the Word; that is the kind of Christian you are -

0:05:55.280,0:06:04.680
sense-knowledge believers.

0:06:04.680,0:06:08.560
You have to see in order to believe.

0:06:08.560,0:06:11.960
"No, what are you telling me?"

0:06:11.960,0:06:15.000
You must see in order to believe.

0:06:15.000,0:06:19.240
You have to see in order to believe.

0:06:19.240,0:06:29.780
You cannot believe beyond what your senses register.

0:06:29.780,0:06:35.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:35.680,0:06:39.780
Let's look at one gentleman in the Bible here.

0:06:39.780,0:06:44.840
The Book of John 20:24.

0:06:44.840,0:06:46.140
It says:

0:06:46.140,0:06:55.640
"Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.

0:06:55.640,0:07:02.580
So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord!'

0:07:02.580,0:07:10.780
But he said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands

0:07:10.780,0:07:26.500
and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.'"

0:07:26.500,0:07:30.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:30.780,0:07:47.820
This is sense-ruled Thomas - a man like us.

0:07:47.820,0:08:00.820
You have to see in order to believe; we cannot believe beyond what our senses register -

0:08:00.820,0:08:04.180
this is the kind of Christian we are.

0:08:04.180,0:08:15.400
Our daily battle is with our senses.

0:08:15.400,0:08:23.940
We fight the people we see and our weapon of warfare is not carnal.

0:08:23.940,0:08:27.480
Our armour is divine.

0:08:27.480,0:08:30.380
We fight the people we see

0:08:30.380,0:08:33.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:33.300,0:08:37.960
Somebody curses you, you believe you want to fight. You fight your sister, your brother.

0:08:37.960,0:08:41.040
You preach against your brother.

0:08:41.040,0:08:45.240
We react  to the things we see.

0:08:45.240,0:08:49.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:49.660,0:09:03.520
The Bible says that we cannot know the things that are freely given to us of the Father

0:09:03.520,0:09:06.780
until we are recreated.

0:09:06.780,0:09:09.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:09.640,0:09:15.300
The Book of Luke 10:20 - what does it say?

0:09:15.300,0:09:22.620
Don't rejoice because the spirit submits to you;

0:09:22.620,0:09:33.460
rejoice because your name is written in the Book of life.

0:09:33.460,0:09:51.340
Today we are pastors, prophets, evangelists just because we dream and it comes to pass.

0:09:51.340,0:10:05.860
We are pastors, evangelists, prophets just because we prophesy and it comes to pass.

0:10:05.860,0:10:12.420
We are pastors, evangelists, bishops just because we pray and things happen.

0:10:12.420,0:10:26.340
The Spirit may convict us, speak through us, operate in us

0:10:26.340,0:10:33.940
but He cannot make His home in us unless we are recreated.

0:10:33.940,0:10:37.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:37.060,0:10:47.560
There are a lot of pastors, bishops, prophets everywhere - just dream and it comes to pass.

0:10:47.560,0:10:49.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:49.780,0:10:55.460
Prophesying - it will rain tomorrow and suddenly it rains.

0:10:55.460,0:10:59.880
Ah! You people will come together to build a church for him

0:10:59.880,0:11:03.100
because the prophecy has come to pass.

0:11:03.100,0:11:06.680
That is your assessment today.

0:11:06.680,0:11:13.280
So many of us here become a Christian today because you speak, the results come.

0:11:13.280,0:11:17.640
You dream and you say your dream and it comes to pass.

0:11:17.640,0:11:19.880
Oh, that makes you a Christian.

0:11:19.880,0:11:22.960
What is the way out? That is the question for you and I.

0:11:22.960,0:11:25.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:25.100,0:11:31.200
Because you already have to agree with me that you are a sense-knowledge believer.

0:11:31.200,0:11:36.660
Tell your neighbour, "You are a sense-knowledge believer".

0:11:36.660,0:11:37.860
I can't hear you.

0:11:37.860,0:11:42.120
[You are a sense-knowledge believer.]

0:11:42.120,0:11:53.720
To know God better is to know your calling and it's to know your spiritual gifts.

0:11:53.720,0:11:58.200
What is the way out?

0:11:58.200,0:12:11.300
The principal source of finding ourselves recreated is the Bible - there is no substitute for it.

0:12:11.300,0:12:12.220
Tell your neighbour:

0:12:12.220,0:12:25.360
The principal source of finding ourselves recreated is the Bible - there is no substitute for it.

0:12:25.360,0:12:30.940
If there is no substitute for it, how do we get the Bible into our hearts - the Word of God?

0:12:30.940,0:12:36.800
Don't forget - the Bible is given by the inspiration of God.

0:12:36.800,0:12:40.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:40.220,0:12:45.280
You can read the Bible a hundred times, million times;

0:12:45.280,0:12:52.560
as long as you hold grudges, unforgiveness,

0:12:52.560,0:13:04.300
as long as you harbour bitterness, envy, jealous, hatred, it makes no meaning.

0:13:04.300,0:13:17.520
The Bible is given by inspiration of God. Holy men were carried along by the Spirit.

0:13:17.520,0:13:27.960
You can read the Bible a hundred thousand times; as long as you hold grudges,

0:13:27.960,0:13:41.720
as long as you harbour unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred, it makes no meaning.

0:13:41.720,0:13:52.640
It is as if you are reading history. Reading history is reading about events.

0:13:52.640,0:13:54.960
That is where your problem comes from.

0:13:54.960,0:14:01.400
Tell your neighbour, "This is where my problem comes from".

0:14:01.400,0:14:02.920
I can't hear you.

0:14:02.920,0:14:04.580
[This is where my problem comes from.]

0:14:04.580,0:14:07.780
Face your neighbour, say, "This is our problem".

0:14:07.780,0:14:10.380
This is just....

0:14:10.380,0:14:11.700
This is your problem.

0:14:11.700,0:14:19.580
You take the Bible when you are not happy, when you are very upset, when you are hurt,

0:14:19.580,0:14:23.880
when you're facing challenges, situations - your are disturbed.

0:14:23.880,0:14:28.380
No! You need a free spirit to read the Bible.

0:14:28.380,0:14:44.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:44.780,0:14:48.320
Trust and Obey

0:14:48.320,0:15:00.680
For there is no other way
To be happy in Jesus

0:15:00.680,0:15:07.920
But to trust and obey

0:15:07.920,0:15:09.740
That is just your problem.

0:15:09.740,0:15:11.420
You don't have any other problem.

0:15:11.420,0:15:15.100
To get the Word of God, you cannot get it.

0:15:15.100,0:15:21.200
You have plenty Bibles on your shelf, your library but they are not in your heart

0:15:21.200,0:15:24.200
There are here - sense.

0:15:24.200,0:15:28.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:28.820,0:15:42.080
In order to read your Bible effectively,  I suggest reading the Bible aloud,

0:15:42.080,0:15:45.580
particularly the New Testament.

0:15:45.580,0:15:53.980
Say the Scripture to yourself. Say the Word to yourself.

0:15:53.980,0:16:06.680
Insert your own name where the message is personal.

0:16:06.680,0:16:09.940
Because I want you to be spiritual.

0:16:09.940,0:16:26.680
We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.

0:16:26.680,0:16:29.300
So, I don't know how you walk with the Lord.

0:16:29.300,0:16:38.620
The Bible says possessing a spiritual gift is an important part of our walking with the Lord.

0:16:38.620,0:16:45.540
Because you can't walk with the Lord. How can you walk with Spirit, when you are not spirit?

0:16:45.540,0:16:46.800
How can you walk?

0:16:46.800,0:16:51.380
God is Spirit and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and truth.

0:16:51.380,0:16:54.980
Look, this is the Spirit  and I'm here with body.

0:16:54.980,0:16:57.800
Is it possible for me to walk with the Spirit?

0:16:57.800,0:17:00.680
It is not possible; you have to be spiritual.

0:17:00.680,0:17:02.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:02.920,0:17:14.120
Possessing a spiritual gift is an important part of our walking with the Lord.

0:17:14.120,0:17:20.040
You have to be spiritual to walk with the Lord.

0:17:20.040,0:17:23.860
You have to be spiritual.

0:17:23.860,0:17:35.320
You can be a prophet, pastor, bishop and yet not be what God wants you to be.

0:17:35.320,0:17:38.420
Message title:
WHAT GOD WANTS US TO BE

0:17:38.420,0:17:52.180
You can be a president of a country yet not...

0:17:52.180,0:17:57.620
I told you the reward of being the person of God -

0:17:57.620,0:18:07.960
the genuine peace of heart, the legacy to live for generations.

0:18:07.960,0:18:11.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:11.560,0:18:18.160
If today is your last day on earth, what do you think can live in you for generations?

0:18:18.160,0:18:27.820
What we have now is through controversy, fight, disagreement, "No this one is mine",

0:18:27.820,0:18:34.600
debt in the bank - we are rich but so much debt.

0:18:34.600,0:18:39.640
Everything we have - enveloped by controversies.

0:18:39.640,0:18:44.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:44.440,0:18:47.760
So please, think about that. It's very very important.

0:18:47.760,0:18:53.980
Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.

0:18:53.980,0:19:02.240
If you say, "What is my calling?", you are saying, "What is my spiritual gift?" - that is what you are asking.

0:19:02.240,0:19:04.380
Hallelujah!

0:19:04.380,0:19:07.140
What message are you taking home today?

0:19:07.140,0:19:20.260
Am I really the person God wants me to be?

0:19:20.260,0:19:27.320
It's very important to discover yourself. What I'm talking about is our destiny.

0:19:27.320,0:19:34.460
If I am not operating on my destiny, if I'm not given the spiritual gift to operate,

0:19:34.460,0:19:40.340
what I have been going through in the past is enough to send me packing.

0:19:40.340,0:19:45.480
Look at the Apostles in the Bible; I look at the trial and temptation they went through

0:19:45.480,0:19:47.860
and I now begin to compare myself too.

0:19:47.860,0:19:57.320
I see that, "Ah, history will tell about my trial and persecution".

0:19:57.320,0:20:03.380
The most persecuted pastor; not only that, there is nothing I have not gone through in this country.

0:20:03.380,0:20:15.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:15.060,0:20:20.600
There is need for you to know your calling.

0:20:20.600,0:20:24.560
If you don't know your calling and you are operating, whatever you become,

0:20:24.560,0:20:30.360
it does not take these people a second to bring you down.

0:20:30.360,0:20:35.700
Your calling is your gift, spiritual gift.

0:20:35.700,0:20:39.120
The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.

PRAYER TIME

0:20:48.280,0:20:53.280
Right now, let us submit to the Spirit of God and welcome Him in your heart.

0:20:53.280,0:20:59.440
Welcome Him.

0:20:59.440,0:21:10.140
Father, we thank You!

0:21:10.140,0:21:15.540
I release you from the pain of the past!

0:21:15.540,0:21:22.580
Be released from the pain of the past!

0:21:22.580,0:21:34.860
Pain of the past is the cause of unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred.

0:21:34.860,0:21:40.440
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:21:40.440,0:21:44.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:44.520,0:21:51.040
Anything that does not glorify God, forget about it; put it behind you.

0:21:51.040,0:21:59.980
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:21:59.980,0:22:02.960
Say to yourself, "I am released".

0:22:02.960,0:22:05.660
Believe that.

0:22:05.660,0:22:07.060
I can't hear you.

0:22:07.060,0:22:08.780
[I am released!]

0:22:08.780,0:22:11.920
Whatever satan might have used -

0:22:11.920,0:22:16.340
satan can use unforgiveness to connect you to himself.

0:22:16.340,0:22:18.340
This is weapon.

0:22:18.340,0:22:29.620
They are weapons of satan - unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred.

0:22:29.620,0:22:35.660
These are the weapons satan uses; this is why I say, don't hold offence.

0:22:35.660,0:22:41.320
Satan uses offence to connect us to himself.

0:22:41.320,0:22:47.400
You say, "Ah, how can satan connect me?" - Yes, through unforgiveness.

0:22:47.400,0:22:53.360
You say, "I will not forgive. What this man has done to me is too bad. He cheated me".

0:22:53.360,0:22:58.440
Whether you are right or wrong, you are not supposed to hold offence.

0:22:58.440,0:23:04.340
That offence, satan uses that to connect us.

0:23:04.340,0:23:10.320
That offence is a chain of satan.

0:23:10.320,0:23:13.900
You have to. Right now, work on that. Work on your life.

0:23:13.900,0:23:17.940
That is when I say, whatever satan might have used -

0:23:17.940,0:23:20.560
what are the things satan uses?

0:23:20.560,0:23:28.660
Unforgiveness, hatred, envy, jealousy, pain of the past.

0:23:28.660,0:23:32.860
He uses those things to connect us to himself.

0:23:32.860,0:23:43.800
I can see them being broken!

0:23:43.800,0:23:48.540
Tell your neighbour, "I can read my Bible and understand it now".

0:23:48.540,0:23:49.820
I can't hear you.

0:23:49.820,0:23:57.100
[I can read my Bible and understand it now.]

0:23:57.100,0:24:01.000
With unforgiveness, it makes no meaning.

0:24:01.000,0:24:07.940
It is as if you are reading History, Literature, Chemistry books.

0:24:07.940,0:24:10.820
This is just it - offence.

0:24:10.820,0:24:14.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:14.620,0:24:18.800
Listen to me: I'm not praying for you, I'm just telling you what is happening right now.

0:24:18.800,0:24:24.440
I can see them being broken!

0:24:24.440,0:24:27.340
The chains have been broken!

0:24:27.340,0:24:30.620
Agree! Rejoice over that!

0:24:30.620,0:24:33.320
Confess this, confess your freedom now.

0:24:33.320,0:24:42.080
Chains have been broken!

0:24:42.080,0:24:45.720
Chain of affliction has been broken!

0:24:45.720,0:24:48.900
Chain of setback has been broken!

0:24:48.900,0:24:52.960
Chain of isolation has been broken!

0:24:52.960,0:25:05.220
Chain of career failure has been broken!

0:25:05.220,0:25:09.780
Open your lips and confess this - freedom!

0:25:09.780,0:25:22.640

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:27.940,0:25:31.240
The question now: Who is my enemy?

0:25:31.240,0:25:34.560
That is the question you need to ask yourself.

0:25:34.560,0:25:42.200
Unforgiveness, envy - these are your enemies.

0:25:42.200,0:25:56.900
Bitterness, hatred, jealousy, pain towards others - these are your enemies.

0:25:56.900,0:26:05.920
If you have nightmare, you wake up, ask yourself, "I harbour unforgiveness; that is why this nightmare.

0:26:05.920,0:26:11.520
I harbour pain, hatred, envy; that brother, I have not yet forgiven that brother.

0:26:11.520,0:26:12.860
That is why I am having nightmare.

0:26:12.860,0:26:16.260
Because this is the chain, this is the connection to satan.

0:26:16.260,0:26:22.820
Satan has no route to get you but he uses the route of unforgiveness, envy, jealousy.

0:26:22.820,0:26:30.920
Please, talk to yourself.

0:26:30.920,0:26:33.480
Thank you very much.
