0:01:03.200,0:01:12.900

South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:05:46.000,0:05:53.160
This is just a word of  exhortation.

0:05:53.160,0:06:02.100
So let's take our bible to the Book of Psalm.

0:06:02.100,0:06:19.960
The Book of Psalm 66:18

0:06:19.960,0:06:36.100
"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened."

0:06:36.100,0:06:44.620
Let's take our bible also to the Book of Matthew 5

0:06:44.620,0:06:56.300
It's related to that Book of Psalm 66:18.

0:06:56.300,0:07:00.140
Let's read verse 8.

0:07:00.140,0:07:13.560
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see Jesus."

0:07:13.560,0:07:19.840
It's all about heart.

0:07:19.840,0:07:40.060
Psalm 66:18 says,"If I cherish iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."

0:07:40.060,0:07:47.780
In this Matthew 5:8 it says,

0:07:47.780,0:07:54.220
"Blessed are the pure in heart.."

0:07:54.220,0:08:03.520
Take note: If I cherish iniquity in my heart

0:08:03.520,0:08:08.400
the Lord will not hear me.

0:08:08.400,0:08:14.420
Heart, heart , heart, heart

0:08:14.420,0:08:18.140
What does this mean to us?

0:08:18.140,0:08:29.120
It means the greatest thing the Lord looks into is our heart.

0:08:29.120,0:08:42.880
The greatest thing, the most cherished thing the Lord looks into is our heart.

0:08:42.880,0:08:53.840
We are made in our hearts to be like Jesus.

0:08:53.840,0:09:08.680
Whatever colour, race appearance - does not matter.

0:09:08.680,0:09:29.580
Whether you are black, yellow, red - whatever colour the judgment will be based on our heart

0:09:29.580,0:09:39.400
that is the content of our character.

0:09:39.400,0:09:40.540
Yes

0:09:40.540,0:09:47.360
We are made in our hearts to be like him.

0:09:47.360,0:09:58.160
If you cherish iniquity in your heart, the Lord will not hear you.

0:09:58.160,0:10:13.880
This is why only faith pleases God and faith is of man's heart

0:10:13.880,0:10:23.180
When we say 'heart' we mean, ' the spirit of man' - Biblically.

0:10:23.180,0:10:27.460
Heart

0:10:27.460,0:10:48.640
Whatever appearance, colour, race does no matter - heart

0:10:48.640,0:11:01.920
With a pure heart, a man knows that Jesus is Lord.

0:11:01.920,0:11:13.160
With a pure heart, a man knows that Jesus is righteousness.

0:11:13.160,0:11:23.920
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves.

0:11:23.920,0:11:35.020
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus heals.

0:11:35.020,0:11:49.760
If you cherish iniquity, that is sin, if your honour iniquity in your heart

0:11:49.760,0:11:54.800
The Lord will not listen to you.

0:11:54.800,0:12:19.620
God listens, Jesus listens as you pray and He replies in relation to the state of your heart.

0:12:19.620,0:12:24.800
You say Jesus, Jesus, Jesus help me Jesus , Jesus

0:12:24.800,0:12:43.940
He listens, replies in relation to the state of your heart.

0:12:43.940,0:13:01.540
If you hold grudges in your "heart and you are saying, "Jesus", you are wasting your time.

0:13:01.540,0:13:20.000
If you hold offence in your "heart and you are saying, "Jesus", you are wasting your time.

0:13:20.000,0:13:29.320
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:13:29.320,0:13:55.400
If you hold offence in your heart, don't be surprised if the Bible makes no meaning to you

0:13:55.400,0:14:17.260
If you hold offence such as bitterness, grudges, anger, hatred,  and so forth and you open the Bible

0:14:17.260,0:14:32.800
and you hold offence against someone, against anyone and you are reading Bible, you are wasting your time

0:14:32.800,0:14:41.120
You are reading literature

0:14:41.120,0:14:50.260
This is The Book of books

0:14:50.260,0:14:58.260
When you are reading it, you are reading the Holy Spirit.

0:14:58.260,0:15:03.440
Heart.

0:15:03.440,0:15:20.740
If we know we are made in our heart to be like Jesus, why are we fighting over colour?

0:15:20.740,0:15:33.240
Why short, why height, why big stomach, why small stomach?

0:15:33.240,0:15:42.100
I want to be like Jesus in my heart.

0:15:42.100,0:15:59.820
If you hold offence in your heart, don't be surprised that your prayer will not accepted.

0:15:59.820,0:16:05.640
My heart, yes!

0:16:05.640,0:16:12.340
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:16:12.340,0:16:24.940
Finally I will take you to the Book of Romans

0:16:24.940,0:16:33.060
Romans 9:1

0:16:33.060,0:16:54.360
"I speak the truth in Christ - I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit."

0:16:54.360,0:17:01.120
Today, conscience is ignored,

0:17:01.120,0:17:11.640
which is the very instrument Holy Spirit uses.

0:17:11.640,0:17:20.340
to ride, to push us and to guide us.

0:17:20.340,0:17:24.700
We ignore the conscience.

0:17:24.700,0:17:35.520
Today, we talk about the Holy Spirit, whereas the conscience - your heart,

0:17:35.520,0:17:55.060
which the Holy Spirit uses as a guide to the soul is ignored

0:17:55.060,0:18:15.420
In order to pray effectively, there must not be anything between us and God.

0:18:15.420,0:18:30.600
The conscience we ignore is the very root, the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses to guide us.

0:18:30.600,0:18:42.900
So you say,  holy, holy holy whereas the heart is full of iniquity. Holding grudges, holding hatred.

0:18:42.900,0:19:05.640
Holy , holy, first talk to your heart

0:19:05.640,0:19:13.120
When the Holy Spirit comes, if the heart is not free, it can't attract the Spirit of God.

0:19:13.120,0:19:23.400
We must allow our spirit to be free from grudges, hatred, bitterness before we say,"Holy."

0:19:23.400,0:19:50.660
If not, the Holy Spirit will come and move round without attending to you.

0:19:50.660,0:20:08.180
Our heart is the contact point, our heart is the communication point for the Holy Spirit

0:20:08.180,0:20:18.440
If the contact point is not free ---

0:20:18.440,0:20:31.520
Your heart is the communication point; take care of your heart.

0:20:31.520,0:20:43.260
Free your heart from offence such as grudges, hatred and bitterness.

0:20:43.260,0:20:53.440
Free your heart!

0:20:53.440,0:20:57.720
You must free your heart.

0:20:57.720,0:21:03.740
Stop ignoring your heart;

0:21:03.740,0:21:10.000
it's the contact point of the Holy Spirit

0:21:10.000,0:21:11.140
tell your neighbour

0:21:11.140,0:21:24.200
Stop ignoring your heart; it's the contact point of the Holy Spirit.

0:21:24.200,0:21:30.960
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:21:30.960,0:21:37.120
Contact point of the Holy Spirit.

0:21:37.120,0:21:49.020
It is essential for every Christian to be free of offence

0:21:49.020,0:21:54.480
What you are facing today is as a result of offence

0:21:54.480,0:22:10.760
Offence has opened the door to the various situations in your life

0:22:10.760,0:22:14.700
Yes that is offence.

0:22:14.700,0:22:21.540
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:22:21.540,0:22:27.220
Viewers, thank you

0:22:27.220,0:22:34.720
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:22:34.720,0:22:50.180
I was trying to counsel you yesterday, concerning the issue of healing and deliverance

0:22:50.180,0:23:05.240
It's not only healing or deliverance, help from God; if God sends you to help your neighbour

0:23:05.240,0:23:23.460
The help that comes from the heart, we don't give that help first before you receive reward.

0:23:23.460,0:23:33.080
Let me give you a good example; issue of healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings

0:23:33.080,0:23:56.820
No one can give money from the heart, before healing is given.

0:23:56.820,0:24:09.580
No one can give money from the heart, before healing.

0:24:09.580,0:24:19.540
You can give money but that money is not from the heart

0:24:19.540,0:24:30.520
No one can give money but that money is not from the heart before healing and God's blessings.

0:24:30.520,0:24:39.420
And anything given that is not from the heart is a sin.

0:24:39.420,0:24:48.080
If you give me this and it is not  from your heart, it will not bless me.

0:24:48.080,0:24:57.260
I would use it  but it will not bless my life.

0:24:57.260,0:25:11.440
But if you now give me from your heart, it will bless me and bless my future.

0:25:11.440,0:25:24.040
Money should not be exchanged for God's blessing.

0:25:24.040,0:25:41.980
If I deliver you and you are free, whatever you give me after that will come from your heart

0:25:41.980,0:25:49.340
And it will bless  life, now and forever.

0:25:49.340,0:25:57.840
God has a way of talking to people's hearts

0:25:57.840,0:26:12.800
Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings are hindered by the way and manner

0:26:12.800,0:26:18.020
we go about the issue of money.

0:26:18.020,0:26:31.500
That is why you see the fire of revival is going down.

0:26:31.500,0:26:44.160
The fire of revival is going down.

0:26:44.160,0:27:05.320
When we give freely as we are given by God, God will Raise His people to bless you in abundance.

0:27:05.320,0:27:15.780
When it is time for revival , it is time for sacrifice.

0:27:15.780,0:27:23.420
It's always good to sacrifice first  before receiving

0:27:23.420,0:27:30.780
Sacrifice means labour before revival.... by the time revival comes , it will come in a way that

0:27:30.780,0:27:48.740
will bless your career, your future forever

0:27:48.740,0:28:02.400
God bless you. This is my message and I will continue to preach this anywhere.

0:28:02.400,0:28:06.960
Hallelujah!
