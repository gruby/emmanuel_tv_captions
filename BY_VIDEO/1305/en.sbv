Prayer Line At The Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:00:01.900,0:00:02.945
As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for those afflicted with various sicknesses

0:00:05.825,0:00:08.725
and diseases in the Peru crusade,

0:00:08.725,0:00:11.585
the chains of bondage in their lives are broken as the power of Jesus Christ is clearly present on the scene.

0:00:14.545,0:00:17.745
I have pain in my coccyx.

0:00:18.285,0:00:20.285
Man of God, I want to be healed!

0:00:20.285,0:00:21.375
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:00:21.375,0:00:23.475
Knee trauma has left this lady confined to a wheelchair.

0:00:23.475,0:00:24.855
But with just a simple touch from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua, in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:00:27.885,0:00:30.395
she begins to walk to the glory of God.

Ysela Juarez Carranza                          
  Lima, Peru

0:00:49.895,0:00:52.405
I am 41 years old.

0:00:52.695,0:00:55.745
As a result of an accident, I developed a knee problem and was unable to walk.

0:00:58.825,0:01:01.825
The prognosis from the doctor said that the problem was congenital.

0:01:04.685,0:01:06.135
I was unable to walk and I also had a problem with my coccyx.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:01:17.445,0:01:20.405
For how long have you been having this problem?

0:01:20.405,0:01:23.155
Four years.

0:01:26.065,0:01:28.765
I went to four hospitals, two clinics and ultimately, they did not know the exact problem I had.

0:01:33.525,0:01:35.335
The last doctor I went to said that because I was born with the knee condition,

0:01:38.385,0:01:41.635
I needed an operation but there was no guarantee it would fix the problem I had.

0:01:41.635,0:01:44.505
Testimony From The Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:01:50.255,0:01:53.195
It was very difficult.

0:01:53.195,0:01:57.900
My knees would swell up and I felt a lot of pain in my coccyx.

0:01:57.900,0:01:59.675
I couldn't walk; I needed other people to assist me.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:02:11.345,0:02:14.425
What happened at the crusade when Prophet T.B. Joshua put his hand on you?

0:02:17.465,0:02:19.775
The prophet put his hand on my head, on my knees which were very swollen

0:02:22.425,0:02:25.305
and on my back and told me to walk.

0:02:25.305,0:02:27.740
How did you feel right after the crusade?

0:02:28.295,0:02:31.105
I feel really good.

0:02:31.105,0:02:34.095
I thank God.

0:02:34.095,0:02:36.255
Do you still use the wheelchair?

0:02:36.255,0:02:37.095
I am not using it.

0:02:40.245,0:02:43.195
I walk normally; I could not run or climb stairs in a normal way.

0:02:46.235,0:02:49.225
Can you show us what you can do right now?

0:02:49.225,0:02:51.905
Testimony From The Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:02:51.905,0:02:54.955
Yes and I can run too!

0:02:54.955,0:02:57.045
Mrs Ysela runs to the glory of God

0:02:57.045,0:03:00.085
because she no longer has the knee trauma that she once had before.

0:03:00.085,0:03:02.965
Thank You, Jesus!
