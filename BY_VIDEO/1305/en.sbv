As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for those afflicted with various sicknesses

0:00:04.980,0:00:10.900
and diseases in the Peru crusade, the chains of bondage in their lives are broken

0:00:10.900,0:00:15.580
as the power of Jesus Christ is clearly present on the scene.

0:00:15.580,0:00:17.780
I have pain in my coccyx.

0:00:17.780,0:00:19.440
Man of God, I want to be healed!

0:00:19.440,0:00:22.600
Knee trauma has left this lady confined to a wheelchair.

0:00:22.600,0:00:26.100
But with just a simple touch from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:00:26.100,0:00:30.820
in the name of Jesus Christ, she begins to walk to the glory of God.

Ysela Juarez Carranza
Lima, Peru

0:00:50.900,0:00:52.880
I am 41 years old.

0:00:52.880,0:00:58.420
As a result of an accident, I developed a knee problem and was unable to walk.

0:00:58.420,0:01:03.520
The prognosis from the doctor said that the problem was congenital.

0:01:03.520,0:01:08.320
I was unable to walk and I also had a problem with my coccyx.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade
With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:01:16.360,0:01:21.280
For how long have you been having this problem?

0:01:21.280,0:01:24.840
Four years.

0:01:24.840,0:01:32.320
I went to four hospitals, two clinics and ultimately, they did not know the exact problem I had.

0:01:32.320,0:01:37.000
The last doctor I went to said that because I was born with the knee condition,

0:01:37.000,0:01:41.640
I needed an operation but there was no guarantee it would fix the problem I had.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade
With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:01:51.100,0:01:52.580
It was very difficult.

0:01:52.580,0:01:56.920
My knees would swell up and I felt a lot of pain in my coccyx.

0:01:56.920,0:02:01.240
I couldn't walk; I needed other people to assist me.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade
With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:02:11.380,0:02:16.460
What happened at the crusade when Prophet T.B. Joshua put his hand on you?

0:02:16.460,0:02:22.240
The prophet put his hand on my head, on my knees which were very swollen

0:02:22.240,0:02:26.760
and on my back and told me to walk.

0:02:26.760,0:02:29.280
How did you feel right after the crusade?

0:02:29.280,0:02:32.080
I feel really good.

0:02:32.080,0:02:34.200
I thank God.

0:02:34.200,0:02:35.800
Are you still using the wheelchair?

0:02:35.800,0:02:37.960
I am not using it.

0:02:37.960,0:02:45.400
I walk normally; I could not run or climb stairs in a normal way.

0:02:45.400,0:02:48.080
Can you please show us what you can do right now?

Testimony From The Peru Crusade

0:02:52.720,0:02:54.460
Yes and I can run too!

0:02:54.460,0:02:57.120
Mrs Ysela runs to the glory of God

0:02:57.120,0:03:01.120
because she no longer has the knee trauma that she once had before.

0:03:01.120,0:03:03.000
Thank You, Jesus!
