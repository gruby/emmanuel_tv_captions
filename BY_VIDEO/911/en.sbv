0:00:00.040,0:00:01.560
How are you, brother?

0:00:01.560,0:00:03.560
Where is your wife?

0:00:03.560,0:00:05.140
That's my wife.

0:00:05.140,0:00:06.860
There's a problem in the house.

0:00:06.860,0:00:09.400
That's very correct. That's why we are here.

0:00:09.400,0:00:12.780
When the two of you sit together, there is a big problem.

0:00:12.780,0:00:14.300
That's very correct, Prophet.

0:00:14.300,0:00:18.020
For the past three months now, this house has not been in order.

0:00:18.020,0:00:20.760
That's a hundred percent correct, Prophet!

0:00:20.760,0:00:23.180
It's like a cat and a rat living together.

0:00:23.180,0:00:26.540
One hundred percent. I can't say anymore.

0:00:26.540,0:00:29.240
You have to help this auntie. You have to help her.

0:00:29.240,0:00:30.540
Okay, Prophet.

0:00:30.540,0:00:32.200
You just have to help her.

0:00:32.200,0:00:33.220
Okay, Prophet.

0:00:33.220,0:00:37.280
So, don't use the family she comes from against her

0:00:37.280,0:00:40.340
because she comes from a disorganised family.

0:00:40.340,0:00:42.200
Okay, Prophet.

0:00:42.200,0:00:43.560
You are a prophet!

0:00:43.560,0:00:45.160
Thank you very much.

0:00:45.160,0:00:46.300
I want to see you.

0:00:46.300,0:00:47.320
Thank you.

0:00:47.320,0:00:49.880
Leaving this woman - it will affect you

0:00:49.880,0:00:51.700
because she is a woman that God has given you.

0:00:51.700,0:00:53.360
Thank you, Prophet.

0:00:53.360,0:00:57.020
You were bleeding in the past.

0:00:57.020,0:00:58.580
Yes, Prophet. That's very true.

0:00:58.580,0:01:00.500
What was the cause of the bleeding?

0:01:00.500,0:01:02.140
I have two fibroids in my womb.

0:01:02.140,0:01:03.600
Apart from fibroids.

0:01:03.600,0:01:08.940
I used to have an imbalance in my hormones so when the doctor tried to correct it, then --

0:01:08.940,0:01:11.260
Because I'm seeing bleeding, bleeding, bleeding.

0:01:11.260,0:01:12.980
Yes, it's very true.

0:01:12.980,0:01:18.020
I want to see you people - and you don't have affection for this woman.

0:01:18.020,0:01:21.780
It is not her that does not have affection; you don't have affection.

0:01:21.780,0:01:23.780
I don't know what the problem is, Prophet.

0:01:23.780,0:01:25.460
It's very true, Man of God; he doesn't have.

0:01:25.460,0:01:30.940
She loves you, she wants you, she wants to show love but you - you say, "Go and wait there!"

0:01:30.940,0:01:31.960
That's very true.

0:01:31.960,0:01:35.800
She has now turned to somebody you employed, not even your wife.

0:01:35.800,0:01:37.400
I think I need to see you.

0:01:37.400,0:01:38.780
Thank you very much, Prophet!

0:01:38.780,0:01:40.000
You're a nice man.

0:01:40.000,0:01:41.540
Thank you very much.

0:01:41.540,0:01:44.420
She's my mother-in-law, Prophet. She lives with us.

0:01:44.420,0:01:46.020
There is trouble in their house.

0:01:46.020,0:01:48.600
Don't worry. I have said it already.

0:01:48.600,0:01:53.500
You know the young people today - they don't want you to interfere in their family.

0:01:53.500,0:01:54.360
Thank you, Man of God!

0:01:54.360,0:01:56.740
Go and wait for me.

0:01:56.740,0:01:59.980
Everything will be alright.

0:01:59.980,0:02:01.460
My name is Chakoi.

0:02:01.460,0:02:07.380
I'm a Cameroonian by nationality but I live with my husband in Namibia.

0:02:07.380,0:02:10.120
This is my husband; his name is Helms.

0:02:10.120,0:02:12.220
This is my step-daughter, Emma.

0:02:12.220,0:02:15.560
This is my son, Helms Junior.

0:02:15.560,0:02:18.780
This is my mother, Katrine.

0:02:18.780,0:02:23.820
The prophecy that the man of God gave to us last Sunday was very true.

0:02:23.820,0:02:28.280
For the last three months, there have been serious problems in our house;

0:02:28.280,0:02:29.960
a lot of disagreements.

0:02:29.960,0:02:33.740
My husband asked me to pack my things and leave the house.

0:02:33.740,0:02:39.060
The problem we were having in the house was centred on my step-daughter,

0:02:39.060,0:02:43.000
the care of my step-daughter.

0:02:43.000,0:02:48.200
Actually, when my husband brought me to Namibia, everything was fine.

0:02:48.200,0:02:53.100
I came and met him in the house with a baby so I took the baby as my own baby.

0:02:53.100,0:02:55.860
So, as we were living and things were going on,

0:02:55.860,0:03:00.460
I finally discovered that there were things that were not very right in the life of this child.

0:03:00.460,0:03:02.380
Ok, before you go any further.

0:03:02.380,0:03:06.380
You were talking about a step-daughter. Could you tell us the daughter you are talking about?

0:03:06.380,0:03:08.700
This is my step-daughter; she is right here.

0:03:08.700,0:03:13.300
She is five years and about ten months old.

0:03:13.300,0:03:18.580
So, when I came and met her in Namibia, she just turned three.

0:03:18.580,0:03:26.760
Everything was fine until I started noticing some things in the child that are not correct.

0:03:26.760,0:03:28.900
The child was so unruly.

0:03:28.900,0:03:36.800
When I tried to put things right in the life of the child, it was very difficult.

0:03:36.800,0:03:39.820
Another thing that I noticed with the baby was that

0:03:39.820,0:03:42.720
the baby does not like for us to have prayers in the house,

0:03:42.720,0:03:46.320
she does not like the reading of the Bible, she does not like to go to church and all of that.

0:03:46.320,0:03:48.680
I was concerned about it and told my husband

0:03:48.680,0:03:54.180
that these things are not normal for a little baby like this.

0:03:54.180,0:03:59.040
So, I took her to several men of God for prayers.

0:03:59.040,0:04:04.920
They also confirmed to me that the baby was possessed.

0:04:04.920,0:04:11.380
So, they prayed for her and gave me anointing oil which I was using on the baby.

0:04:11.380,0:04:13.880
There were other attitudes in the child.

0:04:13.880,0:04:18.920
Nobody wants to bring up a child that is spoilt.

0:04:18.920,0:04:25.360
She was spoilt and the thing that marvelled me was how she talked at her age,

0:04:25.360,0:04:28.600
the way she would act and behave; it was not correct.

0:04:28.600,0:04:31.760
I tried to put things right; she was so unruly.

0:04:31.760,0:04:35.920
In the process of putting these things together,

0:04:35.920,0:04:39.380
my husband was seeing it as if I was not treating the child well.

0:04:39.380,0:04:44.160
As time went on, I came to discover that they segregated themselves from me.

0:04:44.160,0:04:47.100
When they were together, they were talking and laughing.

0:04:47.100,0:04:49.820
When I came close to them, they stayed quiet.

0:04:49.820,0:04:53.000
When they moved to another place and were talking, when I came, they would stay quiet.

0:04:53.000,0:04:56.600
When I left, they would start talking; when I came, they would stay quiet.

0:04:56.600,0:04:59.940
My presence was not really comfortable for them.

0:04:59.940,0:05:04.240
So I told them that I didn't have company in this house, I need company in the house.

0:05:04.240,0:05:06.300
If you people don't give me company, fine.

0:05:06.300,0:05:10.040
I will pray to God. When God will give me my own company, you people should not complain.

0:05:10.040,0:05:12.360
So you people should continue enjoying yourselves

0:05:12.360,0:05:16.040
but know that when God gives me my own company, nobody should complain.

0:05:16.040,0:05:19.440
In the course of time, I also had my own baby.

0:05:19.440,0:05:22.800
So when I shifted attention now to my own baby, my husband said that

0:05:22.800,0:05:26.420
I'm showing discrimination; there cannot be two children in the house

0:05:26.420,0:05:28.420
with one getting all the love, the other one not getting all the love.

0:05:28.420,0:05:31.540
I said, you are the ones that showed me that; you put me on one side.

0:05:31.540,0:05:34.000
So I don't have company; my company is here.

0:05:34.000,0:05:36.640
So let me enjoy my own company too.

0:05:36.640,0:05:45.840
Another issue of serious concern was that when I was about 4 months pregnant,

0:05:45.840,0:05:47.340
one morning --

0:05:47.340,0:05:52.860
I used to get up in the morning, prepare her and take her to school, and bring her back.

0:05:52.860,0:05:58.020
Even in the process of trying to make her become cultured because she was so uncultured.

0:05:58.020,0:06:01.080
She uses abusive language and all of that.

0:06:01.080,0:06:06.620
She does not hear this from us in the house so I tried to put things in order in her life.

0:06:06.620,0:06:10.260
One morning I was sick; I was not feeling fine.

0:06:10.260,0:06:13.020
So I got up; the housemaid prepared the baby.

0:06:13.020,0:06:16.460
She then told me, "The baby is ready. Please come and carry the baby to school".

0:06:16.460,0:06:21.000
I said, "Please, I'm very sick. Take taxi money and carry the baby to school".

0:06:21.000,0:06:25.340
She was taking the baby to school and told the baby, "We are going to school in a taxi".

0:06:25.340,0:06:28.440
The baby said, "There cannot be two cars" - I mean, at the age of four.

0:06:28.440,0:06:32.580
The baby said, "There cannot be two cars in my father's compound

0:06:32.580,0:06:34.460
and I'm going to school in a taxi.

0:06:34.460,0:06:38.260
Go and tell that woman to get out of that bed and take me to school".

0:06:38.260,0:06:41.700
The thing got on my nerves; I was like, what is this?

0:06:41.700,0:06:43.620
What kind of unruliness is this?

0:06:43.620,0:06:48.180
So I said, "As a point of discipline, you are only going to go to school in a taxi.

0:06:48.180,0:06:50.960
Your nanny will take you to school and bring you back from school

0:06:50.960,0:06:55.500
so that tomorrow when there is no car in the house, you will know that you have to take taxi".

0:06:55.500,0:07:01.560
My husband was seeing that as if I was maltreating the child, sending the child away from him.

0:07:01.560,0:07:05.020
All of these things came into play.

0:07:05.020,0:07:06.700
He was kind of wondering.

0:07:06.700,0:07:10.260
With the new baby, now I'm happy and rejoicing.

0:07:10.260,0:07:12.440
I look at my baby and smile.

0:07:12.440,0:07:17.420
Since the child is not comfortable in my presence, so she will also keep her own distance.

0:07:17.420,0:07:25.400
So the distance made my husband to become very uncomfortable.

0:07:25.400,0:07:31.340
Three months ago, he told me that my step-daughter was not happy

0:07:31.340,0:07:34.640
since she saw the baby entering the house.

0:07:34.640,0:07:37.280
That if I didn't make things right in the house,

0:07:37.280,0:07:43.260
with the baby not being comfortable in my presence, I should pack my things and leave

0:07:43.260,0:07:46.280
because he was not going to sit down and watch

0:07:46.280,0:07:50.820
and stay in a house where the wife is this way with her child, and the step-daughter this way.

0:07:50.820,0:07:53.040
He didn't know how to manage the situation

0:07:53.040,0:07:55.740
so the best thing was for me to pack my things and go.

0:07:55.740,0:07:57.300
So I said, "Okay, fine".

0:07:57.300,0:08:02.700
With the course of time, he decided to bring me to The SCOAN

0:08:02.700,0:08:06.240
so that the man of God should handle our case

0:08:06.240,0:08:09.000
because it was more than him; he didn't know what to do.

0:08:09.000,0:08:12.900
Ok. In the course of sharing your experience with us, you made us to understand

0:08:12.900,0:08:20.700
that it got to a state whereby you had to start taking your step-daughter from one prayer house to another.

0:08:20.700,0:08:23.600
Could you tell us the reason why you were going from one prayer house to another

0:08:23.600,0:08:26.560
and what was your impression right at that point in time?

0:08:26.560,0:08:30.840
The thing that was surprising to me was that

0:08:30.840,0:08:35.880
even when you were reading the Bible in the house, she would tell you, "Don't read that book here.

0:08:35.880,0:08:39.640
I don't want you to read that book. Is that the only book you can read in this house?"

0:08:39.640,0:08:41.640
If you took her to church, she didn't want to go to church.

0:08:41.640,0:08:43.640
"Come and let's pray." - "No."

0:08:43.640,0:08:45.740
You said you took her from one prayer house to another.

0:08:45.740,0:08:49.880
Could you tell us - what was your impression about your step-daughter?

0:08:49.880,0:08:54.180
From what the men of God were saying, the impression was that the baby is possessed.

0:08:54.180,0:08:56.200
So I don't hide anything from my husband.

0:08:56.200,0:09:00.940
I came and told my husband, "Please, this is what I've been told. This is what is happening.

0:09:00.940,0:09:04.860
So what do you think?".

0:09:04.860,0:09:08.560
There were times that even when I pointed out something that was not right with the child,

0:09:08.560,0:09:12.240
my husband would get so angry with me that he would not talk to me for two weeks.

0:09:12.240,0:09:17.360
Ok. Finally, you are here in The SCOAN. What do you want now?

0:09:17.360,0:09:22.740
What is want is that the man of God should say something about the baby and our marriage

0:09:22.740,0:09:25.260
because I'm here for the man of God to help me.

0:09:25.260,0:09:28.480
This man wants me out of his house.

0:09:28.480,0:09:30.480
Ok. Let's hear from your husband.

0:09:30.480,0:09:35.980
Mr & Mrs Helms Atud & Family - Prophecy Confirmation

0:09:35.980,0:09:37.680
Thank you very much.

0:09:37.680,0:09:39.680
Good morning everybody!

0:09:39.680,0:09:41.420
My name is Helms Atud.

0:09:41.420,0:09:44.760
I'm a Cameroonian living in Namibia with my family.

0:09:44.760,0:09:46.420
This is my wife Chakoi.

0:09:46.420,0:09:54.680
This is my daughter from another relationship that didn't go well.

0:09:54.680,0:10:02.560
When the child was ten months old, the mother tried to commit suicide and abandoned the baby.

0:10:02.560,0:10:04.980
The government gave this baby to me.

0:10:04.980,0:10:08.140
Later on, I had full custody of the child.

0:10:08.140,0:10:10.780
I have been living with her since the age of ten months.

0:10:10.780,0:10:16.340
That is our son Helms Junior, and my mother-in-law Katrine.

0:10:16.340,0:10:18.960
When we were here on last Sunday,

0:10:18.960,0:10:24.240
I was one of the first people the Spirit of God located through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:10:24.240,0:10:29.400
I was seated right over there. He came to me and said, "How are you, sir?"

0:10:29.400,0:10:31.640
I said, "I'm fine". He asked, "Where is your wife?"

0:10:31.640,0:10:35.260
I said, "There is my wife". He said, "There is a problem in your home.

0:10:35.260,0:10:39.720
For the past three months, you have been living like cat and mouse at home.

0:10:39.720,0:10:42.600
There is no peace in your home.

0:10:42.600,0:10:48.960
Your wife loves you. This is a woman God has given you but there is no affection from your side".

0:10:48.960,0:10:51.700
And he asked me to try and help my wife.

0:10:51.700,0:10:54.980
Those were the prophecies, and I confirm these prophecies to be true.

0:10:54.980,0:10:58.300
As my wife said, three months ago we had an argument

0:10:58.300,0:11:05.200
and I told her if we cannot solve this problem in our home, I cannot live like this anymore.

0:11:05.200,0:11:10.780
That was in August. And I told her very clearly that there is August, September, October.

0:11:10.780,0:11:15.720
By the end of October, if we cannot find a solution, I will be renting an apartment

0:11:15.720,0:11:21.100
and she will go and stay with the little boy and I will stay with the girl in the house.

0:11:21.100,0:11:23.240
How did this come about?

0:11:23.240,0:11:26.900
When my wife came from Cameroon,

0:11:26.900,0:11:30.960
I had already explained the situation of this little girl to her in Cameroon.

0:11:30.960,0:11:35.100
So when she moved over and we got married, we were living happily.

0:11:35.100,0:11:38.840
It was just honeymoon, seriously.

0:11:38.840,0:11:44.540
Six, seven, eight months down the road, my wife was not getting pregnant.

0:11:44.540,0:11:49.740
She started getting very worried.

0:11:49.740,0:11:52.200
She started praying, fasting for seven days.

0:11:52.200,0:11:56.920
I have never seen it; seven days, day and night, she would eat and drink nothing,

0:11:56.920,0:11:59.140
just praying for the fruit of the womb.

0:11:59.140,0:12:02.580
I told her that God will give us a child at His own time.

0:12:02.580,0:12:04.160
That did not end there.

0:12:04.160,0:12:09.580
My wife now started praying with a lot of pastors - too many pastors.

0:12:09.580,0:12:11.500
They were giving too many revelations.

0:12:11.500,0:12:19.320
One of the revelations was: The reason she was not conceiving is because this child is possessed.

0:12:19.320,0:12:23.680
Now, this is a child I had been living with since ten months.

0:12:23.680,0:12:26.300
I didn't know anything about that.

0:12:26.300,0:12:29.300
I said, "Fine. Tell the pastor to come to our house.

0:12:29.300,0:12:33.380
As we see on Emmanuel TV, when somebody is possessed, they deliver the person".

0:12:33.380,0:12:41.400
This pastor came, stayed with us, asked me to get salt, olive oil and a breakable plate.

0:12:41.400,0:12:45.820
That they will do deliverance in the middle of the night.

0:12:45.820,0:12:48.440
He came in the middle of the night and did the deliverance.

0:12:48.440,0:12:51.340
To be honest, I thought that was it.

0:12:51.340,0:12:53.840
The pastor left and went back the next day.

0:12:53.840,0:12:56.140
But this problem still continued.

0:12:56.140,0:13:01.440
At that point now, there was tension between my wife and the little girl,

0:13:01.440,0:13:05.040
and it was creating a distance.

0:13:05.040,0:13:07.220
Three or four months went by.

0:13:07.220,0:13:12.920
Still prayer, fasting, prophecies, revelations - it was every day.

0:13:12.920,0:13:18.340
One morning my wife got up and said to me that she couldn't find her wedding ring.

0:13:18.340,0:13:20.980
She went to bed with the wedding ring but now she cannot find it.

0:13:20.980,0:13:23.700
It has been removed from her hand. I said, "What do you mean?

0:13:23.700,0:13:28.280
You might have forgotten it in the bedroom. Just check around".

0:13:28.280,0:13:30.960
A prophecy came from that situation

0:13:30.960,0:13:34.040
that the little child is possessed and is fighting the marriage.

0:13:34.040,0:13:38.140
That's why we were in that situation.

0:13:38.140,0:13:42.880
Then now I said, "Ok, fine. Let's go to church. Let's go to your church".

0:13:42.880,0:13:45.700
We went to her church and met the pastors.

0:13:45.700,0:13:47.900
They prayed and delivered the child.

0:13:47.900,0:13:49.640
We went back home.

0:13:49.640,0:13:51.640
The situation was not changing.

0:13:51.640,0:14:00.760
I got confused. This girl, at this age - she was just about four then, and depression had kicked in.

0:14:00.760,0:14:03.160
She was on depression medication.

0:14:03.160,0:14:07.340
I was like, "No. A child at this age cannot be on depression medication".

0:14:07.340,0:14:11.580
The child was by herself, my wife was by herself.

0:14:11.580,0:14:14.780
When I came home, I was confused, I didn't know what to do.

0:14:14.780,0:14:17.020
I love my wife, I love my daughter.

0:14:17.020,0:14:19.300
I found myself in the middle; I didn't know what to do.

0:14:19.300,0:14:23.700
I just said to myself, "She is praying every day. God will definitely answer her prayers

0:14:23.700,0:14:25.880
and she will get pregnant".

0:14:25.880,0:14:28.160
We lived like that; no happiness.

0:14:28.160,0:14:31.220
Three or four months down the line, my wife told me she was pregnant.

0:14:31.220,0:14:34.400
I was celebrating. I said, "This is the end of our problem".

0:14:34.400,0:14:37.540
No, this was not the end of our problem.

0:14:37.540,0:14:41.520
Now, she got pregnant.

0:14:41.520,0:14:44.400
I thought the distance would close.

0:14:44.400,0:14:47.240
The problem would get solved but the problem didn't get solved.

0:14:47.240,0:14:50.320
At that point now, it got worse.

0:14:50.320,0:14:55.520
I only heard this story she explained about her reason for not taking the child to school

0:14:55.520,0:14:58.180
whilst being at The SCOAN and we are living together

0:14:58.180,0:15:00.740
and this has been going on for more than a year.

0:15:00.740,0:15:04.420
So she stopped taking the child to school.

0:15:04.420,0:15:06.500
We are blessed; we have a lot of cars.

0:15:06.500,0:15:11.820
She drives; she is at home studying for her Master's degree programme in public health.

0:15:11.820,0:15:15.340
As she studies, she stays at home; she is not working.

0:15:15.340,0:15:18.760
So she normally takes the child to school; they go to church together.

0:15:18.760,0:15:22.880
Now, she stopped taking the child to school, stopped taking the child to church.

0:15:22.880,0:15:27.200
The nanny is the one - she gives the nanny taxi money to take the child.

0:15:27.200,0:15:31.580
The school is a five minutes drive from our home - five minutes.

0:15:31.580,0:15:34.840
On Sundays she goes to church; the nanny takes the child to church.

0:15:34.840,0:15:39.720
I looked at the situation and said, "Fine. She is a pregnant lady. Let me just leave it".

0:15:39.720,0:15:43.700
They say that when a lady is pregnant, her attitude, her behaviour, everything changes.

0:15:43.700,0:15:45.340
I left it at that point.

0:15:45.340,0:15:47.160
But it went on and on.

0:15:47.160,0:15:51.320
I got up one morning and said to her, "I don't know what is happening.

0:15:51.320,0:15:56.660
Where is that beautiful, loving, God-fearing lady I got married to?

0:15:56.660,0:16:01.280
How can you be so bitter? Even to take a child to school?

0:16:01.280,0:16:03.940
I don't care whether the child is possessed or not.

0:16:03.940,0:16:08.760
This is a child God has given me. That is my cross but I give her my life.

0:16:08.760,0:16:12.540
And I'm seeing you, you cannot just take this child to school.

0:16:12.540,0:16:16.480
If I'm dead, will you pay her school fees?" That is what I asked her.

0:16:16.480,0:16:23.000
No reaction came from my wife and honestly, that moment everything died within me.

0:16:23.000,0:16:26.120
I just decided, "Fine. I will just wait for her to give birth.

0:16:26.120,0:16:29.100
I will see how the situation will go".

0:16:29.100,0:16:31.880
She gave birth.

0:16:31.880,0:16:35.500
I was hoping now that she had given birth to a child.

0:16:35.500,0:16:39.200
Maybe she will understand how I feel towards this child,

0:16:39.200,0:16:41.500
now that she has a child of her own.

0:16:41.500,0:16:43.340
That was my thinking.

0:16:43.340,0:16:46.000
But it still didn't get any better.

0:16:46.000,0:16:47.900
It just didn't get any better.

0:16:47.900,0:16:52.000
The distance was just there; my wife wanted nothing to do with the child.

0:16:52.000,0:16:56.880
We were living together in a house - there is no happiness, love, togetherness.

0:16:56.880,0:17:00.400
I was confused; I didn't know what to do.

0:17:00.400,0:17:03.380
At that moment I just made a decision,

0:17:03.380,0:17:07.060
"My wife is studying; I cannot live with this situation anymore".

0:17:07.060,0:17:12.860
It has given me so much stress, my BP has gone so high,

0:17:12.860,0:17:15.600
I'm already on BP medication.

0:17:15.600,0:17:19.140
I even left my house one morning so confused and stressed,

0:17:19.140,0:17:23.300
drove my car into the street and an oncoming car hit me

0:17:23.300,0:17:26.800
Luckily it was a small taxi - I was driving a landcruiser -

0:17:26.800,0:17:31.660
it hit the car - it wasn't driving too fast; nobody was hurt.

0:17:31.660,0:17:35.580
I just apologised; my insurance took care of everything.

0:17:35.580,0:17:39.960
At that point, I started thinking that I can't live like this anymore.

0:17:39.960,0:17:42.060
I really didn't know what I had to do.

0:17:42.060,0:17:47.280
I made a promise to myself that I will make sure that my wife finishes her studies,

0:17:47.280,0:17:50.340
and make sure she gets a good job.

0:17:50.340,0:17:53.620
I started talking to my friends in her field,

0:17:53.620,0:17:57.440
"You are in public health, my wife is not in public health. Please, I want her--".

0:17:57.440,0:17:59.080
So we already started that process.

0:17:59.080,0:18:05.100
In my mind, I was thinking that when she gets a job, she will be settled,

0:18:05.100,0:18:08.780
find her an apartment, I put her there with the child,

0:18:08.780,0:18:11.480
we try to live apart, I see whether that works.

0:18:11.480,0:18:16.960
That was what I was thinking and I made up my mind, quietly within me.

0:18:16.960,0:18:21.360
We were just living with no love, no happiness, no affection, nothing.

0:18:21.360,0:18:29.960
Even in the midst of this challenge of your biological daughter being alleged as a witch,

0:18:29.960,0:18:35.500
and you were still trying to make preparations for your wife to get a job after her studies.

0:18:35.500,0:18:37.140
Yes, because that is our son.

0:18:37.140,0:18:40.480
If I'm not there tomorrow, I want to know that my wife is in a situation

0:18:40.480,0:18:43.060
where she can take care of our son.

0:18:43.060,0:18:45.320
That is what I was thinking to myself.

0:18:45.320,0:18:51.220
Now, with that mindset, I just decided to leave that situation at that point.

0:18:51.220,0:18:55.020
Three months ago, as the man of God rightly said--

0:18:55.020,0:19:01.480
My doctor is also a family friend. They have three daughters - friends of hers.

0:19:01.480,0:19:04.440
So when I went to my doctor that my medication was not working.

0:19:04.440,0:19:07.100
My BP was still high; I was having a lot of headache.

0:19:07.100,0:19:09.720
She should please do something about it.

0:19:09.720,0:19:11.760
She changed my medication.

0:19:11.760,0:19:17.820
Then she said to me, "But it is weekend. Why don't you send Emma over to spend time with the girls?"

0:19:17.820,0:19:21.500
I said, "It is fine. I will drop Emma over on Friday".

0:19:21.500,0:19:27.440
Going to pick Emma now, they called me on the side, "What is going on in your home, Helms?"

0:19:27.440,0:19:30.980
Who is Emma?

0:19:30.980,0:19:33.540
Emma is my daughter - this one.

0:19:33.540,0:19:38.100
I dropped her over at the doctor's house.

0:19:38.100,0:19:40.540
The husband is a medical doctor, the wife is a medical doctor,

0:19:40.540,0:19:43.260
the husband is a Cameroonian as well, living in Namibia.

0:19:43.260,0:19:48.980
We are in a Cameroonian community, we socialise in that way.

0:19:48.980,0:19:51.120
So I dropped Emma over.

0:19:51.120,0:19:56.540
Now going to get Emma, the husband asked me, "Helms, what is going on in your house?

0:19:56.540,0:20:02.580
As a medical doctor, I will speak. I don't really want to get involved in your family issue.

0:20:02.580,0:20:05.200
But this child is very depressed.

0:20:05.200,0:20:09.800
This child is very depressed and she is refusing to go back home.

0:20:09.800,0:20:12.600
Because I've been trying to take her back home, she is crying and refusing.

0:20:12.600,0:20:15.340
She doesn't want to go back home, that she is not happy".

0:20:15.340,0:20:19.880
Upon hearing this, I became very sad and angry.

0:20:19.880,0:20:23.220
I took Emma home, called my wife and told her,

0:20:23.220,0:20:26.200
"See, we have two kids.

0:20:26.200,0:20:31.780
We cannot have this girl and the little boy in the same house as parents,

0:20:31.780,0:20:36.040
and one is getting all the love, all the affection and all the attention

0:20:36.040,0:20:38.200
and the other is getting nothing.

0:20:38.200,0:20:42.440
So this situation already got me so stressed up.

0:20:42.440,0:20:44.280
I can't take it anymore.

0:20:44.280,0:20:45.980
This is August.

0:20:45.980,0:20:48.560
August, September, October - three months.

0:20:48.560,0:20:54.760
Within these three months, find a way to see how we can live in this house as a family".

0:20:54.760,0:20:57.740
That is what I told my wife. "If not, that's it!

0:20:57.740,0:21:00.280
We are going apart. I will find an apartment for you".

0:21:00.280,0:21:04.200
What I was planning to do after, I decided of doing it now

0:21:04.200,0:21:06.380
because I just couldn't take it anymore.

0:21:06.380,0:21:10.420
And this is in accordance with the three months the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, mentioned.

0:21:10.420,0:21:11.880
Exactly.

0:21:11.880,0:21:15.980
Seriously, our journey of coming here has been too long.

0:21:15.980,0:21:22.360
It has been two years of pain, two years of frustration, two years of unhappiness.

0:21:22.360,0:21:24.940
Still it was a challenge coming to The SCOAN.

0:21:24.940,0:21:32.660
So when I said that now to my wife, a couple of days later she went to see her pastor.

0:21:32.660,0:21:37.300
Her pastor called me. I think she explained the situation, what I had told her, that we are going apart.

0:21:37.300,0:21:42.740
Her pastor called me and said, "Your wife told me this problem you guys are having at home

0:21:42.740,0:21:45.160
concerning this child".

0:21:45.160,0:21:51.060
I said to him, "Pastor, I'm in your church, my wife fellowships there.

0:21:51.060,0:21:55.900
We've been bringing this problem here for over a year.

0:21:55.900,0:21:59.220
If there is no solution, what do you want me to do?

0:21:59.220,0:22:02.960
If not, to just separate them apart because I cannot take it.

0:22:02.960,0:22:04.960
You are a pastor, pray and deliver her".

0:22:04.960,0:22:09.240
The pastor said to me, "No, it is not that I cannot pray and deliver this child.

0:22:09.240,0:22:13.720
It is that too many other pastors have spoken

0:22:13.720,0:22:17.200
and your wife is dead convinced that the child is possessed".

0:22:17.200,0:22:21.700
So he didn't want to say anything because it would be controversial.

0:22:21.700,0:22:30.540
So he then said to me that the coordinators in Namibia who coordinate for people to come to The SCOAN

0:22:30.540,0:22:34.360
were coming to his church in the next 30 minutes.

0:22:34.360,0:22:39.140
That is the only place he believed I could go to.

0:22:39.140,0:22:43.960
And the only man of God he believed that could speak peace and happiness

0:22:43.960,0:22:49.360
into my family, is Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:49.360,0:22:52.880
You mean, this was a recommendation given by the pastor in Namibia?

0:22:52.880,0:22:56.840
This is what the senior pastor of my church told me.

0:22:56.840,0:23:01.140
He also came to The SCOAN; he was there last week.

0:23:01.140,0:23:03.880
He said, "I'm going to The SCOAN.

0:23:03.880,0:23:06.860
Prophet T.B. Joshua is my holy father.

0:23:06.860,0:23:08.640
So, I'm going to The SCOAN.

0:23:08.640,0:23:12.140
The people organising the trip are coming to my office.

0:23:12.140,0:23:18.520
So if you can afford it, please that is the only place I know

0:23:18.520,0:23:22.080
were you can go to and you will have peace at home.

0:23:22.080,0:23:28.600
Because once Prophet T.B. Joshua speaks, he will deliver your family.

0:23:28.600,0:23:32.380
So that is why I came here.

0:23:32.380,0:23:36.980
Once I walked into the church and was given a seat, I was just praying to myself,

0:23:36.980,0:23:38.980
"Lord, let the man of God locate us.

0:23:38.980,0:23:42.680
We cannot come here and go back because this is our last bus stop".

0:23:42.680,0:23:44.000
That was my prayer.

0:23:44.000,0:23:46.520
I was one of the first people he located.

0:23:46.520,0:23:52.400
So I'm here trusting that whilst we are here speaking, this problem is finished.

0:23:52.400,0:23:54.520
We go back a happy family.

0:23:54.520,0:23:59.720
I love my wife. I love my daughter. But I just don't know to which side to go.

0:23:59.720,0:24:03.540
I cannot take sides, I just cannot take sides.

0:24:03.540,0:24:08.780
Even coming here, the day before we started our journey,

0:24:08.780,0:24:13.680
a good family friend called me in the morning and asked, "Where are you, Helms?"

0:24:13.680,0:24:15.840
I said, "I'm on my way to work".

0:24:15.840,0:24:17.280
She asked whether I had gone far.

0:24:17.280,0:24:20.260
I said, "Yes, I left early because I have a very long day

0:24:20.260,0:24:23.560
because I'm travelling out of the country tomorrow".

0:24:23.560,0:24:26.140
She said, "Please come. I need to see you.

0:24:26.140,0:24:31.980
I have a message for you. I was praying and the Holy Spirit gave me a message for you".

0:24:31.980,0:24:35.440
I said, "Holy Spirit! Fine, I'm coming.

0:24:35.440,0:24:40.400
If I cannot make it during the day, I will come at the end of the day on my way home".

0:24:40.400,0:24:42.220
So I couldn't make it during the day.

0:24:42.220,0:24:46.520
At the end of the day, around 9pm on my way home, I stopped at her house.

0:24:46.520,0:24:50.620
She told me that she was praying and the Holy Spirit gave her a revelation

0:24:50.620,0:24:54.380
that we shouldn't go to The SCOAN, we shouldn't go to Nigeria.

0:24:54.380,0:25:02.560
We will not find a solution there. We should rather go to South Africa for prayers.

0:25:02.560,0:25:06.860
Ok. We all know that God is able to do all things.

0:25:06.860,0:25:16.500
In the midst of this confusion, you found your way to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty.

0:25:16.500,0:25:19.880
What do you now want to hear from the man of God?

0:25:19.880,0:25:25.500
I second what my wife said. I want the man of God to speak on this child and our marriage.

0:25:25.500,0:25:28.240
That is all I came here for and that is what I'm praying for.

0:25:28.240,0:25:30.120
Thank you very much.

0:25:30.120,0:25:37.020
Let's hear from our mother.

0:25:37.020,0:25:40.000
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:25:40.000,0:25:44.940
My name is Mrs Katrine Chakoi. I'm a Cameroonian.

0:25:44.940,0:25:48.740
This is my son-in-law. His name is Mr Helms.

0:25:48.740,0:25:53.240
This is my daughter. Her name is Chakoi.

0:25:53.240,0:25:58.080
This is her son. His name is Helms Junior.

0:25:58.080,0:26:03.660
This is her step-daughter. Her name is Emma.

0:26:03.660,0:26:07.940
Ok, because of time. If we gave you time to explain, we would not be able to leave here today.

0:26:07.940,0:26:11.880
And the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, is eager to come into our midst.

0:26:11.880,0:26:16.500
But before then, I hope you are happy that your daughter and your son-in-law are here

0:26:16.500,0:26:18.780
to hear God's opinion about this marriage.

0:26:18.780,0:26:21.740
In fact, I'm very happy because when I went to Namibia,

0:26:21.740,0:26:26.680
I saw them living as strangers in the same house, like cats and dogs.

0:26:26.680,0:26:28.500
Thank you very much.

0:26:28.500,0:26:33.280
To God be the glory. We believe that both of you have taken the right decision

0:26:33.280,0:26:37.840
to come to The SCOAN to hear God's opinion about this marriage

0:26:37.840,0:26:44.500
and the impression of your daughter all over Namibia, to be precise.

0:26:44.500,0:26:49.300
We believe God that at the moment the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, comes out into our midst,

0:26:49.300,0:26:53.440
let's believe God that definitely, we are going to hear God's opinion from him.

0:26:53.440,0:26:56.680
God bless you and thank You, Jesus, for this opportunity.

0:26:56.680,0:27:01.980
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:27:01.980,0:27:08.800
After Mr and Mrs Helms Atud had share their emotional pain and offence that had shaken their marriage,

0:27:08.800,0:27:13.140
Prophet T.B. Joshua came into their midst and spoke the mind of God

0:27:13.140,0:27:16.420
concerning their family and the little girl concerned.

0:27:16.420,0:27:20.920
Surely, the right knowledge of God settles peace.

0:27:20.920,0:27:24.380
Let me talk to my mummy here. Come on!

0:27:24.380,0:27:28.340
I was listening to your testimony, your issue

0:27:28.340,0:27:33.280
concerning the disagreement, the fight between you and your wife and all other.

0:27:33.280,0:27:38.660
I learnt that the whole fight is about our little baby here.

0:27:38.660,0:27:41.980
That she is a witch, she is not a witch, isn't it?

0:27:41.980,0:27:43.400
That's true, Man of God.

0:27:43.400,0:27:46.860
I would like to hear from my sister, not you.

0:27:46.860,0:27:50.840
Let me hear from my sister. Feel free to talk. I just have one minute for you.

0:27:50.840,0:27:55.840
Yes. Actually, when I came to live with my husband,

0:27:55.840,0:27:59.380
I noticed some kind of abnormalities with the baby.

0:27:59.380,0:28:05.920
The baby would not like us to have prayers in the house.

0:28:05.920,0:28:10.120
She was rejecting a lot of things concerning Christianity.

0:28:10.120,0:28:19.120
Ok, simple. We learnt that a lot of prophets and men of God have given that message

0:28:19.120,0:28:20.780
that this lady is a witch.

0:28:20.780,0:28:23.960
That she is possessed.

0:28:23.960,0:28:27.920
Ok. What is your decision?

0:28:27.920,0:28:30.660
Do you see any sign that she is possessed?

0:28:30.660,0:28:37.060
Well, she doesn't like going to church, prayers in the house.

0:28:37.060,0:28:39.140
She just rejects all of these things.

0:28:39.140,0:28:42.460
Ok, it's alright. Thank you.

0:28:42.460,0:28:43.920
Yes, Man of God.

0:28:43.920,0:28:47.500
A lot of prophets have convinced my wife that the child is possessed,

0:28:47.500,0:28:49.180
and that is why we are here.

0:28:49.180,0:28:55.420
Ok. Did your husband let you know that he has a baby at home before you married him?

0:28:55.420,0:28:56.860
Yes, he told me; I knew.

0:28:56.860,0:28:59.020
And you knew the baby before you married your husband?

0:28:59.020,0:29:01.220
Yes, I knew.

0:29:01.220,0:29:05.080
So, if I may just put it this way:

0:29:05.080,0:29:09.520
Since you chose to marry your husband and you knew this baby before you married your husband,

0:29:09.520,0:29:13.680
and your husband never hid this baby from you, he never?

0:29:13.680,0:29:14.940
Yes, he never did.

0:29:14.940,0:29:22.280
Ok. That is to show that whether the lady is a witch or not, and you know the baby,

0:29:22.280,0:29:25.500
and you were able to marry your husband with the witch,

0:29:25.500,0:29:28.880
why do you get to the house and you don't want that witch?

0:29:28.880,0:29:33.000
No, take it.

0:29:33.000,0:29:37.040
So can we say, when you married your husband,

0:29:37.040,0:29:40.520
that is when the witch possessed that lady?

0:29:40.520,0:29:43.980
You know, probably, at the time you later married your husband,

0:29:43.980,0:29:46.100
the witch possessed that girl.

0:29:46.100,0:29:50.440
Because you didn't see the lady as a witch before you married your husband.

0:29:50.440,0:29:56.500
Because I want to believe that if you knew that the lady was a witch,

0:29:56.500,0:29:59.740
you probably may not have married this man. Can you answer the question?

0:29:59.740,0:30:06.180
I came and met her in my husband's house.

0:30:06.180,0:30:12.200
But you told me that when you were outside and about to marry this man,

0:30:12.200,0:30:15.140
he told you that he has a baby.

0:30:15.140,0:30:18.600
Yes, he told me that he had a baby. So I came and I was staying with the baby.

0:30:18.600,0:30:20.340
It was during the time that I was staying with the baby---

0:30:20.340,0:30:22.460
Take it easy.

0:30:22.460,0:30:28.380
The question - you knew this baby, this little girl before you married your husband,

0:30:28.380,0:30:30.540
before you finally came to the house?

0:30:30.540,0:30:31.660
Yes, I did.

0:30:31.660,0:30:35.060
Ok. Did you see her as a witch?

0:30:35.060,0:30:35.980
No.

0:30:35.980,0:30:40.260
Ok, it was when you married the man, the girl became a witch.

0:30:40.260,0:30:41.520
Yes, when I later noticed it.

0:30:41.520,0:30:47.160
No, wait. It was when you came to the house, you later realised that the girl is a witch.

0:30:47.160,0:30:48.380
Yes, I later--

0:30:48.380,0:30:50.580
Wait.

0:30:50.580,0:30:54.200
What I'm saying:

0:30:54.200,0:30:57.400
Before you came to the house, the lady was not a witch.

0:30:57.400,0:30:58.220
Yes.

0:30:58.220,0:31:03.140
Ok. It was when you came to the house and became a wife,

0:31:03.140,0:31:05.280
you later realised that the baby--

0:31:05.280,0:31:06.100
Yes.

0:31:06.100,0:31:08.820
Aha. Ok.

0:31:08.820,0:31:14.900
So this means this child was not a witch before you married her dad.

0:31:14.900,0:31:15.820
No.

0:31:15.820,0:31:25.580
Ok. So it means it must be you and your husband that possessed this girl

0:31:25.580,0:31:29.520
because it must be you and your husband that possessed this girl.

0:31:29.520,0:31:37.700
So if this girl is a witch, it means you are the biggest witch and your husband is the biggest wizard.

0:31:37.700,0:31:42.400
So it is a shameful thing to tell the world that she is a witch

0:31:42.400,0:31:49.360
when you never saw this girl as a witch before you married the father.

0:31:49.360,0:31:52.360
And it was when you got to the house that you realised she is a witch.

0:31:52.360,0:31:58.240
It means it is either you or your husband that possessed this girl.

0:31:58.240,0:32:01.300
My sister, I just want you to learn this wisdom.

0:32:01.300,0:32:06.840
This girl is not a witch at all.

0:32:06.840,0:32:10.380
And two:

0:32:10.380,0:32:13.940
I want to salute you.

0:32:13.940,0:32:18.660
Because if you didn't love this man, if you wanted to leave, you wouldn't need to come here.

0:32:18.660,0:32:21.300
It means the love is there.

0:32:21.300,0:32:24.720
There are some people out there that are deceiving.

0:32:24.720,0:32:27.300
They deceived your spirit

0:32:27.300,0:32:33.020
because you regard them as men of God or women of God.

0:32:33.020,0:32:36.480
Never to blame you at all; you have no blame.

0:32:36.480,0:32:40.680
So I want to say, you are a good woman.

0:32:40.680,0:32:42.620
Why?

0:32:42.620,0:32:46.460
Because for you to come here and for you to be open,

0:32:46.460,0:32:50.480
and you really want to know who this girl is,

0:32:50.480,0:32:56.540
I want to salute you. Thank you very much.

0:32:56.540,0:33:03.580
So she has no blame at all because she is very thorough.

0:33:03.580,0:33:07.000
They say, find out the truth and the truth will set you free.

0:33:07.000,0:33:09.420
She tried to find out the truth.

0:33:09.420,0:33:12.280
If she were wicked, she would have harmed this girl.

0:33:12.280,0:33:15.000
But she never harmed her.

0:33:15.000,0:33:18.740
You know the way and manner people behave to witches and wizards

0:33:18.740,0:33:21.400
when they know a baby is a witch. They can even kill the girl.

0:33:21.400,0:33:24.700
They can even poison the girl. They can even do any evil to that girl.

0:33:24.700,0:33:26.700
But she is not interested in that.

0:33:26.700,0:33:29.040
She just wants to ask from God.

0:33:29.040,0:33:31.440
She never said she is the one who killed her witch.

0:33:31.440,0:33:35.320
She said some people say she is a witch. It is not her fault.

0:33:35.320,0:33:42.980
And I want to thank you too for also persevering, trying to know the truth.

0:33:42.980,0:33:44.980
This woman loves you.

0:33:44.980,0:33:50.080
If you leave this woman, you will leave your destined wife.

0:33:50.080,0:33:52.080
I know she loves me; I know.

0:33:52.080,0:33:56.440
But this issue has caused a lot of distance between us, Man of God.

0:33:56.440,0:33:58.000
That is why we are here.

0:33:58.000,0:34:01.380
Do you know that what happened now will strengthen your marriage.

0:34:01.380,0:34:02.380
Definitely, Man of God.

0:34:02.380,0:34:04.620
And it will make your marriage mature.

0:34:04.620,0:34:06.640
Thank you, Man of God. Thank you very much.

0:34:06.640,0:34:10.840
So you will see that this woman is a mother and you are a father.

0:34:10.840,0:34:13.440
So you people have passed a test in marriage

0:34:13.440,0:34:15.160
Thank you, Man of God. Amen.

0:34:15.160,0:34:19.580
Can you give a hug to your husband? Thank you.

0:34:19.580,0:34:22.080
Thank you, Man of God.

0:34:22.080,0:34:26.000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

0:34:26.000,0:34:28.760
Thank you. I will see you.

0:34:28.760,0:34:32.600
So, madam, you will be my guest. After the service I want to see you.

0:34:32.600,0:34:34.120
Thank you.
