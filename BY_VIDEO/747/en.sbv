0:00:05.560,0:00:07.900
She has depression.

0:00:07.900,0:00:08.400
It's true. She is my wife.

0:00:11.500,0:00:13.140
She's your wife?

0:00:13.140,0:00:15.140
Yes, Man of God. It's true.

0:00:15.140,0:00:16.140
From where?

0:00:16.140,0:00:18.280
We came from the United States.

0:00:18.280,0:00:19.320
The United States?

0:00:19.320,0:00:20.440
Yes.

0:00:20.460,0:00:24.060
She has depression and she has suicidal thoughts.

0:00:24.060,0:00:25.200
It's true.

0:00:25.220,0:00:31.020
Having received a prophecy about the spirit of depression and suicidal thoughts,

0:00:31.020,0:00:36.200
this woman is delivered in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:00:36.260,0:00:42.640
Emmanuel!

0:00:42.640,0:00:43.900
Good Morning!

0:00:43.960,0:00:49.240
My name is Thania Requeno and I'm from the United States.

0:00:49.240,0:00:53.020
This is my husband Akeem Jequeno.

0:00:53.080,0:00:55.780
This is my elder brother, Minor

0:00:55.780,0:00:59.480
and this is my sister in Christ, Elena.

0:00:59.480,0:01:02.400
This is my baby, Caleb.

0:01:02.400,0:01:11.600
What brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations was that I was seeking deliverance,

0:01:11.600,0:01:18.940
seeking breakthrough from stagnation and for my career.

0:01:18.940,0:01:25.040
We were here on January 1st for the New Year Service.

0:01:25.040,0:01:31.720
When the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering, he laid hands on me

0:01:31.720,0:01:34.260
and I manifested.

0:01:34.260,0:01:39.980
I didn't really know what happened. I saw myself on the floor.

0:01:39.980,0:01:46.960
He had prophesied about a spirit of depression and suicidal thoughts.

0:01:46.960,0:01:55.720
When I reflect back on that, I can see how the spirit was attacking me.

0:01:55.720,0:02:01.100
I am more of a people person and

0:02:01.100,0:02:05.900
there would be some times where I would just want to run away from people,

0:02:05.900,0:02:10.800
from my family and after I got married, even from my husband.

0:02:10.800,0:02:13.960
I would isolate myself and go to places.

0:02:13.960,0:02:19.560
Sometimes I would just take my car and drive somewhere and park somewhere and cry.

0:02:19.560,0:02:26.800
Sometimes, I would go into the bathroom, turn the shower on and just cry in the shower.

0:02:26.800,0:02:31.440
I had this deep sorrow in my heart and I didn't really understand why

0:02:31.440,0:02:39.280
because I was born again three years ago and

0:02:39.280,0:02:45.840
my inner spirit would tell me that I was saved, that I believed in Jesus Christ.

0:02:45.840,0:02:51.020
But I still felt this pain, this sorrow, this very deep sorrow -

0:02:51.020,0:02:55.840
I don't know how to explain it - in my heart.

0:02:55.880,0:02:58.320
I would come out of it.

0:02:58.320,0:03:02.300
Sometimes I would argue with my husband but then I would come out of it and

0:03:02.300,0:03:05.180
then I would come back to him and apologise.

0:03:05.180,0:03:07.100
We would even joke about it.

0:03:07.100,0:03:13.080
He would joke about it with me - 'one moment, you're sad and the next moment, you are happy',

0:03:13.080,0:03:18.760
We would joke about it but in all honesty, it was something serious.

0:03:18.760,0:03:24.900
So, when the man of God laid hands on me and he spoke that, it made a lot of sense to me

0:03:24.900,0:03:33.780
and I understood that all those episodes I had were really attacks from the enemy.

0:03:33.780,0:03:39.380
I also remembered that when I came to Christ three years ago,

0:03:39.380,0:03:46.960
I had this supernatural joy over my life that even unbelievers would testify to.

0:03:46.960,0:03:50.720
They would ask me, 'Are you high right now? Are you drunk? Why are you so happy?'

0:03:50.720,0:03:55.440
I would testify and tell them that it was Jesus Christ. I would preach the Gospel.

0:03:55.440,0:04:01.420
Anywhere I went, people would notice that - believers, unbelievers and my family.

0:04:01.420,0:04:05.700
Somehow along the way, that joy left me.

0:04:05.780,0:04:14.500
And so, when the man of God laid hands on me, I know that the joy came back to me.

0:04:14.500,0:04:22.080
I just thank God because I want to testify that Jesus Christ is Lord and

0:04:22.080,0:04:28.180
tell people that there is hope and they don't have to suffer from depression,

0:04:28.180,0:04:33.260
that these are just spiritual things, not physical.

0:04:33.260,0:04:41.120
They are spiritual things that everybody goes through but not everybody knows the solution.

0:04:41.120,0:04:48.000
I just want to thank the Lord for The SCOAN and for the favour and grace over my life,

0:04:48.000,0:04:51.840
over my family's life, over the prophet and over The SCOAN

0:04:51.840,0:04:57.420
because there has just been so much favour since we came on January 1st this year

0:04:57.420,0:05:06.080
and I am excited to go home tomorrow and taste the goodness of the Lord

0:05:06.080,0:05:09.980
and just to walk with Him.

0:05:09.980,0:05:14.840
Indeed words of the mouth are not enough to really express deeply

0:05:14.840,0:05:18.520
what the Lord has done in your life, other than to say, 'Thank You, Jesus Christ'.

0:05:18.520,0:05:25.100
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:05:25.140,0:05:28.200
We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.

0:05:28.220,0:05:32.420
In other words, you are making us to realise that initially you came purposely because

0:05:32.420,0:05:36.900
you wanted financial breakthrough - that was what you came for.

0:05:36.900,0:05:42.740
And all of a sudden the Spirit of God went into areas that were really troubling your life

0:05:42.740,0:05:47.000
but you never took seriously. Is that correct?

0:05:47.000,0:05:49.500
That is correct.

0:05:49.520,0:05:55.120
Like I said, I came for breakthrough from stagnation in my life

0:05:55.120,0:06:01.200
and for my career because I always saw a pattern in those things.

0:06:01.200,0:06:07.720
But the Bible says that God searches the depths of our hearts

0:06:07.780,0:06:11.200
and I know that was what He did that day

0:06:11.200,0:06:18.160
because I was not expecting to have received that word.

0:06:18.160,0:06:25.700
I wanted to receive something about my career - the stagnation again but

0:06:25.700,0:06:31.980
the root of my problems with stagnation and in my career was actually depression

0:06:31.980,0:06:35.900
and suicidal thoughts.

0:06:35.940,0:06:41.720
I could continue and get breakthrough in my career but then not get delivered from depression

0:06:41.720,0:06:48.060
and I wouldn't be able to enjoy that or testify to the goodness of the Lord

0:06:48.060,0:06:53.720
and so I'm just thankful again for the word that I received, for the prophecy

0:06:53.720,0:06:55.400
and for the deliverance.

0:06:55.420,0:06:55.920
Amen.

0:06:55.920,0:06:57.240
Thank You, Jesus.

0:06:57.240,0:07:02.940
Ever since the prophecy came to pass in your life and you were delivered,

0:07:02.940,0:07:06.400
are you still having depression or suicidal thoughts?

0:07:06.460,0:07:10.500
What can you say about the state of your mind and your entire body right now?

0:07:10.520,0:07:16.020
I do not feel any depression. I have no suicidal thoughts.

0:07:16.020,0:07:21.100
I can feel the genuine joy in my spirit ever since

0:07:21.140,0:07:23.060
the prophet laid hands on me.

0:07:23.060,0:07:28.940
The following day, we also went for prayer and I felt something leave my heart again

0:07:28.980,0:07:34.560
and I know that the joy is going to keep coming and coming and I'll be able to

0:07:34.560,0:07:40.760
share the Gospel and share Jesus Christ with everyone.

0:07:40.760,0:07:42.580
I'm thankful for that.

0:07:42.580,0:07:47.800
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God.

0:07:47.840,0:07:49.800
We rejoice with you greatly.

0:07:49.880,0:07:52.420
Before we hear from you a word of advice for all and sundry,

0:07:52.420,0:07:58.700
we just want to hear from your husband.

0:07:58.720,0:08:03.400
Could you just introduce yourself to us and tell us your own side of the story.

0:08:03.460,0:08:06.200
Good Morning Church!

0:08:06.280,0:08:08.640
Emmanuel!

0:08:08.680,0:08:11.940
My name is Akeem Jequenu.

0:08:11.940,0:08:15.280
I am from Benin Republic but I reside in the United States.

0:08:15.280,0:08:23.700
This is my wife Thania. That's my brother-in-law, Minor and that's my sister in Christ, Elena.

0:08:23.760,0:08:30.800
Concerning the prophecy, the word that she received from the man of God is true.

0:08:30.840,0:08:36.600
When I first got married to her, it was something that she would hide from people. People didn't know.

0:08:36.600,0:08:42.500
But being alone in the house with her, I understood that something was going on in her life

0:08:42.500,0:08:48.400
because one moment she would be happy and the next moment, she would be very very sad.

0:08:48.400,0:08:53.320
She would hide and cry. Sometimes I would surprise her when she was crying.

0:08:53.320,0:08:57.900
Then she would make comments like, 'I just feel like going somewhere and drinking'.

0:08:57.900,0:09:01.080
So, I knew it wasn't normal.

0:09:01.080,0:09:09.780
Being a believer in our Lord Jesus Christ, we went to some churches and a lot of places in the US.

0:09:09.780,0:09:18.880
Those big names in the Gospel in the US, we went there seeking help for this trouble.

0:09:18.880,0:09:23.400
But we couldn't find anybody to help.

0:09:23.480,0:09:30.020
I remembered my experience with the Lord a little before I met her.

0:09:30.040,0:09:35.800
When I was still in Africa, people used to talk about Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:09:35.880,0:09:43.320
but for me, I concluded he was not a man of God because of the things I heard from people.

0:09:43.320,0:09:45.320
Also he's not a sweet-talker.

0:09:45.320,0:09:50.920
I listened to him one or two times and asked myself, "Who goes and sits down in his church?

0:09:50.920,0:09:52.940
What do they do there?"

0:09:52.940,0:09:55.800
I didn't really believe he was a man of God.

0:09:55.800,0:10:00.360
But then, when I was in the US, I went through some tough times,

0:10:00.440,0:10:02.760
some very rough times, moments of my life.

0:10:02.760,0:10:08.800
One day I was in New York and I went to one of these mega churches for someone to pray with me.

0:10:08.800,0:10:13.900
The white lady who was praying with me asked me where I was from.

0:10:13.920,0:10:19.420
I said I was from Benin Republic and she said, 'Do you know T.B. Joshua? That's very close to your nation'.

0:10:19.460,0:10:22.200
I said, 'Yes I know T.B. Joshua'.

0:10:22.280,0:10:26.520
And she started talking about how beautiful his ministry is and

0:10:26.520,0:10:33.520
how there were deliverance and family reconciliations, helping the poor and scholarships for the needy.

0:10:33.560,0:10:38.900
And I was like, 'This T.B. Joshua is everywhere. Why is everybody always talking about T.B. Joshua?'

0:10:38.920,0:10:46.100
Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno - Prophecy Testimony

0:10:46.180,0:10:53.920
It's true that I didn't say anything bad about him but in my heart, I knew that he was not a man of God.

0:10:53.960,0:11:00.280
So, later on, I went on a fast because things were going terribly for me,

0:11:00.280,0:11:03.600
I was going through difficult times and hardship.

0:11:03.600,0:11:11.020
I went on a fast for 21 days, just to seek the face of God about my situation and my life.

0:11:11.020,0:11:18.300
And then on the fifth day of my fast, I had a vision early in the morning.

0:11:18.360,0:11:26.020
In this vision, I saw the Lord Jesus Christ in one corner and then I wasn't happy, I was going towards Him.

0:11:26.020,0:11:29.640
But He was pointing in the opposite direction.

0:11:29.640,0:11:33.300
And then I turned back to see and there was Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:11:33.300,0:11:41.900
Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family - Prophecy Testimony

0:11:41.960,0:11:48.340
Still in that moment in the vision, I still convinced myself that, 'This is not a man of God!'

0:11:48.340,0:11:53.140
So I looked at him and I turned back. I was walking to the Lord Jesus Christ

0:11:53.140,0:11:55.680
and He said, 'No, go to him'.

0:11:55.680,0:12:02.100
So I turned back and I went to Prophet T.B. Joshua and the most amazing spiritual experience of my life

0:12:02.100,0:12:03.620
happened that day.

0:12:03.620,0:12:08.600
Because he was reading my mind and telling me everything that I needed to know

0:12:08.680,0:12:11.480
and teaching me great teachings that day,

0:12:11.480,0:12:15.880
Even from that experience only, I can testify that he is a man of God

0:12:15.880,0:12:22.860
because there was no way he could know all those things deep in my heart that he told me.

0:12:22.860,0:12:28.800
After that he told me, 'I have been appointed to take care of you'.

0:12:28.800,0:12:33.020
And I said, 'Does that mean that you are my spiritual father?" And he said, 'Yes'.

0:12:33.020,0:12:37.820
And I said, 'Does that mean that I will walk in the same element as my dad?'

0:12:37.820,0:12:40.540
And he said, 'Yes' and started laughing.

0:12:40.540,0:12:45.940
I remembered in the vision that I didn't have my documents yet to leave the country and come back.

0:12:45.940,0:12:51.940
I was going to say, 'Pray for me so I can go to The SCOAN. I want to come now.'

0:12:51.940,0:12:57.600
And he was smiling as if it was already done and then I came out of that vision.

0:12:57.600,0:13:04.300
Later on, I went online and listened to his preaching.

0:13:04.300,0:13:11.700
And I saw that it is true that he doesn't give motivational speeches but he speaks from the Spirit of God.

0:13:11.700,0:13:16.200
Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family - Prophecy Testimony

0:13:16.220,0:13:26.000
That is not enough for Jesus Christ. Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:13:26.000,0:13:36.420
And I also saw other sides to the ministry and I believe that people in my position then, didn't know that he was doing all these things.

0:13:36.420,0:13:43.540
But from one blackmail to another, people make up their minds that he is not a man of God.

0:13:43.540,0:13:49.880
I sent someone to The SCOAN, saying, 'Get me the Anointing Water, the Sticker and everything you can get'.

0:13:49.880,0:13:55.300
So my friend came here to Nigeria and he sent everything to me.

0:13:55.380,0:14:03.500
I was able to file for residency in the US and I sprinkled and I prayed; I started following him.

0:14:03.540,0:14:11.840
One night, I was listening to the Mass Prayer, the one that he does with viewers all over the world.

0:14:11.840,0:14:15.020
And I was convinced that night.

0:14:15.020,0:14:17.020
I asked myself, 'Why wouldn't I think that this was a man of God?"

0:14:17.020,0:14:21.800
Because everything that comes from his mouth is from God.

0:14:21.840,0:14:27.340
A kingdom divided against itself cannot prosper - that's what the Bible says.

0:14:27.340,0:14:31.180
If this man is of the devil, why is he casting out devils?

0:14:31.180,0:14:37.400
So, it is not possible that he does all these things if he's not from God.

0:14:37.480,0:14:41.000
Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family - Prophecy Testimony

0:14:41.040,0:14:48.000
So I told my wife and my brother-in-law, 'This is the experience I have had with this man of God in Africa'.

0:14:48.000,0:14:53.120
I said, 'We are going to go there as soon as I get my documents' and that's what we did.

0:14:53.120,0:14:58.600
When I got my green card, my brother-in-law told me, 'What are we waiting for?' Let's go now'.

0:14:58.600,0:15:06.500
So, we got our tickets and then we just came here.

0:15:06.500,0:15:11.320
And when you finally came to The SCOAN, could you just reflect on what happened to your wife

0:15:11.320,0:15:13.160
and the state of her mind after the prophecy and deliverance.

0:15:13.160,0:15:15.600
How can you confirm that to be true?

0:15:15.620,0:15:20.500
I confirm the prophecy to be true.

0:15:20.520,0:15:23.760
He's somebody who doesn't live with us.

0:15:23.780,0:15:27.800
If we had filed everything and talked about depression before we came here,

0:15:27.800,0:15:34.500
maybe we would doubt and think that this man just read what we had sent via email and said something.

0:15:34.520,0:15:39.300
But we didn't file anything; we just came on our own and sat at the back there.

0:15:39.300,0:15:43.600
And he came and directly pointed at the issue.

0:15:43.620,0:15:46.020
He said, 'Depression and suicidal thoughts'.

0:15:46.020,0:15:51.120
How in the world would you know that if it was not the Lord who told you?

0:15:51.120,0:15:54.240
Ever since he prayed for her, she is delivered.

0:15:54.240,0:15:56.840
Now, she's happy; even I am happy.

0:15:56.840,0:16:05.240
I used to be so frustrated. My wife would always be happy and then sad. It was on my neck.

0:16:05.240,0:16:09.460
But now, she is free and we are all a very beautiful and happy family.

0:16:09.460,0:16:15.500
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:16:15.540,0:16:21.200
To God be the glory, I think we have to hear from you before you leave.

0:16:21.200,0:16:25.920
Before you were doubting, you never believed that this man was from God

0:16:25.940,0:16:31.200
but after your conviction in the dream, what is your opinion of the prophet

0:16:31.220,0:16:34.300
and also, what is your advice for all and sundry?

0:16:34.360,0:16:35.880
This is what I will say.

0:16:35.880,0:16:40.720
The Bible says that man looks at the outward appearance but God looks at the heart.

0:16:40.760,0:16:44.000
God knows everything about everybody.

0:16:44.000,0:16:49.160
Instead of just picking words from here and there and making up your mind about people,

0:16:49.180,0:16:51.340
why don't you just go to God?

0:16:51.380,0:16:55.900
Because if we are real Christians, we should go to God before we judge anybody,

0:16:55.900,0:17:00.740
or before we say this is not that or this is not a man of God.

0:17:00.760,0:17:04.840
I would advise everybody to just seek God in every situation.

0:17:04.880,0:17:12.080
And make sure that your mind when it is made up is from God and His opinion about people.

0:17:12.080,0:17:13.160
That's what I would say.

0:17:13.160,0:17:19.100
Thank you very much for that word of advice. Let's also hear a word of advice from your wife.

0:17:19.180,0:17:23.900
With all you have experienced, having been delivered from depression and suicidal thoughts,

0:17:23.900,0:17:27.300
what word of advice do you have for everyone?

0:17:27.320,0:17:39.920
I would advise to not seek help from people like doctors or therapists or rehabilitation.

0:17:39.920,0:17:44.200
I would say, just seek God.

0:17:44.200,0:17:51.600
Like my husband said, God sees everything. He sees the deep things. God sees the outer things.

0:17:51.640,0:18:00.820
Most of the problems we face have a spiritual force behind them.

0:18:00.820,0:18:12.920
So, if you don't deal with it spiritually, you are not going to find the solution.

0:18:12.920,0:18:21.000
So, don't seek physical help from doctors or a rehab for something that is spiritual.

0:18:21.000,0:18:24.720
You have to go to God because God is the Deliverer.

0:18:24.720,0:18:32.300
God can touch you, He can heal you. He healed me and God is not a respecter of persons.

0:18:32.300,0:18:38.160
He loves you. After all, it is out of love that He will heal you.

0:18:38.160,0:18:45.800
So seek God and don't seek man. Seek God alone for everything  and anything.

0:18:45.860,0:18:46.740
To God be the glory.

0:18:46.740,0:18:52.680
We believe you are trying to make us understand that we serve the God of nature

0:18:52.680,0:18:55.360
and medicine is from nature.

0:18:55.360,0:18:58.700
Doctors treat while Jesus Christ heals.

0:18:58.700,0:19:04.000
And you are telling us that if it comes to spiritual matters, we should seek the face of God.

0:19:04.060,0:19:04.600
Yes.

0:19:04.660,0:19:06.000
To God be the glory.

0:19:06.060,0:19:11.200
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God.

0:19:11.240,0:19:17.440
Let's hear briefly from your brother-in-law. He may also have some things to contribute.

0:19:17.480,0:19:23.000
Could you just introduce yourself to us and tell us what you have to say about your sister's life.

0:19:23.040,0:19:25.900
Good Morning Church!

0:19:25.980,0:19:34.220
My name is Minor Requeno. This is my sister, Thania and my brother-in-law, Akeem

0:19:34.220,0:19:36.900
and my sister in Christ, Elena.

0:19:36.940,0:19:44.280
This is our first time in Africa and we are just really excited to be here because

0:19:44.280,0:19:48.740
we know that everything that has been going on is from God.

0:19:48.740,0:19:59.600
We actually came a little bit unprepared but God has come through the whole way.

0:19:59.620,0:20:06.980
I want to thank T.B. Joshua for being a true man of God.

0:20:06.980,0:20:16.520
In America and all over the world, there are a lot of false teachers, pastors and prophets.

0:20:16.520,0:20:24.380
But being here for a week and witnessing him and listening to him, I can tell the whole world that

0:20:24.380,0:20:31.100
that this is a man of God.

0:20:31.180,0:20:36.300
To God be the glory and what can you say about your sister, since she has been delivered?

0:20:36.380,0:20:42.800
In my family, I was the first one who got saved and she was the second one.

0:20:42.860,0:20:49.560
I witnessed her salvation. She was just like a glowing beam.

0:20:49.580,0:20:56.720
Everybody could testify that she was full of joy.

0:20:56.720,0:21:04.180
Gradually though, it started to diminish and go down a little bit.

0:21:04.180,0:21:09.540
Akeem was going through hard times, I was going through hard times, with Elena and my sister,

0:21:09.540,0:21:16.240
we all decided to come over here seeking something from the Lord through T.B. Joshua.

0:21:16.240,0:21:24.240
So when he pointed that out in my sister, I knew that it was God, especially seeing her on the ground.

0:21:24.240,0:21:26.860
I knew it was the Lord.

0:21:26.860,0:21:37.220
Ever since then, we are all just really excited and we're just taking that blessing by force; we really are.

0:21:37.320,0:21:42.000
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:21:42.040,0:21:45.800
Finally, what is your word of advice to everyone?

0:21:45.820,0:21:53.740
I would say just like everyone else is saying to open up our hearts.

0:21:53.780,0:22:00.500
Seek the Lord from a true heart and from the bottom of your hearts

0:22:00.500,0:22:07.760
because like they said, He searches the depths of our hearts and we can't fool Him.

0:22:07.760,0:22:13.280
So, if we can just talk to Him and go to Him from the bottom of our hearts,

0:22:13.280,0:22:16.520
I think He will answer us and He will see us through.

0:22:16.520,0:22:19.040
Thank you. Let's finally listen to our sister.

0:22:19.040,0:22:21.900
Emmanuel!

0:22:21.960,0:22:25.720
My name is Elena De la Cruz and I'm from the United States.

0:22:25.760,0:22:33.000
This is my sister in Christ, Thania with baby Caleb, Akeem, Minor - my brothers and sisters in Christ.

0:22:33.020,0:22:37.840
I didn't even know T.B. Joshua existed. I had no clue.

0:22:37.840,0:22:46.100
I was always skeptical on internet preachers and pastors because there are a lot of fake ones out there.

0:22:46.100,0:22:51.080
When they were telling me some of their testimonies and dreams

0:22:51.080,0:22:55.160
and stuff they experienced with T.B. Joshua and who he was,

0:22:55.160,0:22:58.160
I just trusted in God.

0:22:58.160,0:23:02.660
I prayed to the Lord and asked if He wanted me to come here to Africa because this is my first time.

0:23:02.660,0:23:04.980
And He gave me a vision of us coming.

0:23:04.980,0:23:07.180
So I said, 'OK Lord - Your will, not mine'.

0:23:07.180,0:23:14.840
It's faith that brought us all here. It's faith that broke barriers where most people might have been scared to even come.

0:23:14.840,0:23:19.440
And its faith, it's God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit that delivered my sister.

0:23:19.440,0:23:24.080
I had no idea she was depressed; I had no idea she had suicidal thoughts

0:23:24.080,0:23:26.480
but that's a wicked demonic spirit.

0:23:26.480,0:23:34.280
Just trusting in God for deliverance, not in people or psychotherapists or what he, she or it says.

0:23:34.280,0:23:38.360
Just the Lord Jesus Christ - that gives you true deliverance.

0:23:38.400,0:23:46.100
To sit back and watch T.B. Joshua and his ministry, I feel like its a modern-day of what we read in the Bible.

0:23:46.180,0:23:50.280
It gives us so much hope, that the Bible is alive today.

0:23:50.280,0:23:56.200
It's such a beautiful thing to see all of this and everybody coming together

0:23:56.200,0:24:01.920
for the ministry to really deliver people, so people can be set free, so those chains can be broken,

0:24:01.980,0:24:08.140
so my sister can continue growing in the Lord, so her joy can be reignited and she can continue

0:24:08.160,0:24:11.320
spreading God's Word everywhere she goes and planting seeds.

0:24:11.320,0:24:15.660
Even her testimony is going to set souls free and give other people hope.

0:24:15.660,0:24:22.000
I'm so thankful to be along for the ride and to witness all of this.

0:24:22.020,0:24:24.740
It's a blessing; I give God all the glory.

0:24:24.740,0:24:25.720
Amen.

0:24:25.720,0:24:31.300
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:24:31.320,0:24:39.000
Briefly before you go, having experienced the goodness of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ

0:24:39.020,0:24:42.220
through His able servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:24:42.220,0:24:46.400
what word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?

0:24:46.400,0:24:52.640
Trust God. Read His Word on a regular basis, love, love, love.

0:24:52.680,0:24:55.600
It's very important to be in the spirit.

0:24:55.600,0:25:00.320
One thing I learnt from T.B. Joshua is to constantly pray in the spirit.

0:25:00.320,0:25:01.900
I didn't know you could do that.

0:25:01.900,0:25:06.960
Instead of having negative thoughts, etc. constantly stay in the spirit and pray in the spirit

0:25:06.980,0:25:08.900
before you go to bed, in the spirit.

0:25:08.920,0:25:13.100
Be in the spirit and know that the Holy Spirit in you can do all things.

0:25:13.100,0:25:17.880
Jesus Christ's death, burial and resurrection is just love. I love it.

0:25:17.880,0:25:20.200
I give Him all the glory.

0:25:20.240,0:25:23.300
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus!

0:25:23.340,0:25:25.700
Yes, it's been awesome.

0:25:25.720,0:25:31.100
As far as this family is concerned, it is a clear proof that everyone is going home hale and hearty

0:25:31.120,0:25:32.820
and with the goodness of the Lord

0:25:32.820,0:25:38.080
And I believe that when you return to the United States of America, you will continue to share your testimony with all who care to listen.

0:25:38.260,0:25:40.900
We also want to admonish you by letting you know that

0:25:40.900,0:25:43.960
you have been healed, delivered and blessed through the Word of God.

0:25:44.100,0:25:47.740
Make sure you go back and make His Word the standard for your lives.

0:25:47.740,0:25:53.360
And always have it at the back of your minds that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come!

0:25:53.360,0:25:56.820
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!
