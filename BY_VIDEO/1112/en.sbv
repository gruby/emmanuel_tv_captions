0:00:00.000,0:00:04.340
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:04.340,0:00:06.340
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:06.340,0:00:13.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:13.180,0:00:17.260
Yes, give me your heart.

0:00:17.260,0:00:26.960
We are overwhelmed by many things.

0:00:26.960,0:00:32.880
We are overwhelmed by many distractions.

0:00:32.880,0:00:36.080
Jesus needs your heart.

0:00:36.080,0:00:39.060
That is a place of contact.

0:00:39.060,0:00:40.820
Tell your neighbour.

0:00:40.820,0:00:44.160
Jesus needs your heart.

0:00:44.160,0:00:51.360
That is a place of what? - Contact.

0:00:51.360,0:00:59.720
Oh Holy Spirit, free our heart to follow You.

0:00:59.720,0:01:00.980
I can't hear you.

0:01:00.980,0:01:04.720
Oh Holy Spirit, free our heart to follow You.

0:01:04.720,0:01:05.920
I can't hear you.

0:01:05.920,0:01:09.400
Oh Holy Spirit, free our heart to follow You.

0:01:09.400,0:01:17.640
Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You.

0:01:17.640,0:01:19.000
I can't hear you.

0:01:19.000,0:01:23.780
Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You.

0:01:23.780,0:01:33.100
The message is going to terminate every spiritual weakness.

0:01:33.100,0:01:40.200
It's going to be terminated today.

0:01:40.200,0:01:50.840
Every spiritual weakness in you will be terminated.

0:01:50.840,0:01:52.660
It's a prayer language.

0:01:52.660,0:01:57.420
While I'm talking to you, while you're looking at me and I'm looking at you,

0:01:57.420,0:02:04.440
keep saying in your spirit, "Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You".

0:02:04.440,0:02:12.320
Many spirits are in bondage - bondage of unforgiveness,

0:02:12.320,0:02:26.980
bondage of anger, bondage of hatred, bondage of bitterness - just name it.

0:02:26.980,0:02:29.300
Bondage.

0:02:29.300,0:02:49.840
To all the hearts that are in bondage - listen:"Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You".

0:02:49.840,0:02:51.700
Are you busy with that?

0:02:51.700,0:03:00.340
You can be saying it repeatedly until it becomes a reality to you.

0:03:00.340,0:03:02.440
Come on!

0:03:02.440,0:03:07.540
That is the easiest way to invite Jesus into your heart.

0:03:07.540,0:03:12.400
Free my spirit to follow You.

0:03:12.400,0:03:36.240
I have decided to follow Jesus

0:03:36.240,0:03:43.760
No turning back

0:03:43.760,0:04:09.060
I have decided to follow Jesus

0:04:09.060,0:04:18.060
No turning back

0:04:18.060,0:04:24.360
I would want to take you to the book of 2 Peter.

0:04:24.360,0:04:29.700
Whilst you are opening 2 Peter, that should not stop you from your meditation.

0:04:29.700,0:04:31.620
Your meditation should continue.

0:04:31.620,0:04:33.520
Are you there?

0:04:33.520,0:04:37.520
2 Peter 1.

0:04:37.520,0:04:41.380
We take our reading from verse 1.

0:04:41.380,0:04:47.500
"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,

0:04:47.500,0:04:56.100
to those who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ

0:04:56.100,0:05:03.140
have received a faith as precious as ours:"

0:05:03.140,0:05:04.800
Verse 2.

0:05:04.800,0:05:13.140
"Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God

0:05:13.140,0:05:15.940
and of our Lord Jesus Christ."

0:05:15.940,0:05:17.940
Verse 3.

0:05:17.940,0:05:27.100
"...His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge

0:05:27.100,0:05:33.700
of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness."

0:05:33.700,0:05:39.420
Let's go to our proof text.

0:05:39.420,0:05:41.060
Verse 20.

0:05:41.060,0:05:50.000
"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of scripture came about

0:05:50.000,0:05:54.960
by the prophet's own interpretation of things."

0:05:54.960,0:05:57.260
Verse 21.

0:05:57.260,0:06:10.600
"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human..."

0:06:10.600,0:06:15.480
Listen to that - "prophets, though human".

0:06:15.480,0:06:21.000
T.B. Joshua is human.

0:06:21.000,0:06:23.280
Prophet T.B. Joshua is divine.

0:06:23.280,0:06:24.740
Take note of that.

0:06:24.740,0:06:28.360
Everyone has two natures in one person.

0:06:28.360,0:06:39.240
"...prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."

0:06:39.240,0:06:45.340
I want to take you up today on our standard for life.

0:06:45.340,0:06:49.520
As Christians, this is our standard for life.

0:06:49.520,0:06:51.640
This is my standard for life.

0:06:51.640,0:06:53.720
This is your standard for life.

0:06:53.720,0:06:56.240
So, because the way we go about the Bible,

0:06:56.240,0:07:00.400
we don't know the difference between the Bible and other books,

0:07:00.400,0:07:03.500
the difference between the Bible and history,

0:07:03.500,0:07:07.700
the difference between the Bible and chemistry or literature.

0:07:07.700,0:07:13.480
We don't know the difference; we just believe we must read it just like any other book.

0:07:13.480,0:07:15.260
Hallelujah.

0:07:15.260,0:07:21.280
The Bible and the Holy Spirit.

0:07:21.280,0:07:26.460
Read the Bible, read the Holy Spirit.

0:07:26.460,0:07:38.060
It means, the Bible itself is the letter inspired by the Spirit of God.

0:07:38.060,0:07:45.480
When you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.

0:07:45.480,0:07:58.620
As the Lord breathed His Spirit into certain men, so He breathed His Spirit into certain books.

0:07:58.620,0:08:09.100
Holy men were carried along by the Spirit of God as they spoke the message that came from God.

0:08:09.100,0:08:16.700
Holy men were carried along by the Spirit.

0:08:16.700,0:08:22.380
It means, they were carried along by the Spirit - without the Spirit, they cannot...

0:08:22.380,0:08:30.840
They were carried along by the Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God.

0:08:30.840,0:08:34.480
God speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:08:34.480,0:08:38.280
He walks to us by His Word, through His Spirit.

0:08:38.280,0:08:41.680
He calls you through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:08:41.680,0:08:46.140
He whispers to you through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:08:46.140,0:08:49.380
He greets you and you greet Him.

0:08:49.380,0:08:54.840
You speak to Him and He speaks to you through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:08:54.840,0:09:04.900
Holy men were carried along by the Spirit as they spoke the Word that came from God.

0:09:04.900,0:09:11.540
If you must read the Bible, you must be carried along by the Spirit.

0:09:11.540,0:09:16.640
If you must teach the Bible, you must be carried along by the Spirit.

0:09:16.640,0:09:21.580
If you must preach the Word of God, you must be carried along by the Spirit

0:09:21.580,0:09:29.200
because God's Word refreshes our mind and God's Spirit renews our strength.

0:09:29.200,0:09:36.460
If you must teach the Word, you must teach the Word by the Spirit.

0:09:36.460,0:09:44.460
If you must call the name, "Jesus!" - through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:09:44.460,0:09:47.380
"Be healed!" - through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:09:47.380,0:09:50.380
"Hallelujah!" - through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:09:50.380,0:09:55.140
"Hallelujah!" or whatever word in His presence

0:09:55.140,0:10:01.140
because God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and in truth.

0:10:01.140,0:10:10.180
Nowadays, we read the Bible, we pray and the Bible says we don't know how to pray

0:10:10.180,0:10:13.600
but the Spirit is helping our weakness.

0:10:13.600,0:10:25.620
We pray, we read without any regard of or attention to the Spirit of God.

0:10:25.620,0:10:38.600
We pray and read the Bible without any attention or regard for the Spirit of God.

0:10:38.600,0:10:44.340
We do not place Him where He rightly belongs,

0:10:44.340,0:10:52.700
knowing how important He is to us and God.

0:10:52.700,0:10:58.020
That is the Spirit of God.

0:10:58.020,0:11:07.360
We do not place the Spirit of God where He rightly belongs.

0:11:07.360,0:11:11.000
Your spirit needs to be free.

0:11:11.000,0:11:14.320
Free my spirit to follow You.

0:11:14.320,0:11:15.980
Please, don't forget that.

0:11:15.980,0:11:21.940
If your spirit is not free and you are hearing me, you only hear me to preach the Word,

0:11:21.940,0:11:24.940
to teach the Word but not to live it.

0:11:24.940,0:11:31.780
You cannot live by it because the spirit is not free.

0:11:31.780,0:11:41.300
Your spirit must act upon the Word to be part of the Word.

0:11:41.300,0:11:47.520
Free my spirit to follow You.

0:11:47.520,0:11:52.540
How can one be reading the Bible without seeking the attention of the Holy Spirit?

0:11:52.540,0:11:54.360
What are you reading?

0:11:54.360,0:12:00.340
You are not reading the Bible; you are reading history.

0:12:00.340,0:12:03.340
Reading history is reading about events -

0:12:03.340,0:12:11.700
what happened, in Jerusalem, Jeremiah, Jesus Christ.

0:12:11.700,0:12:23.480
The Holy Spirit is the most sensitive of beings

0:12:23.480,0:12:39.600
and is easily hurt by lack of attention and regard.

0:12:39.600,0:12:48.380
When you pick the Bible without seeking His attention, what are you reading?

0:12:48.380,0:13:00.040
Before reading the Bible, we need to seek the attention of the Holy Spirit

0:13:00.040,0:13:08.580
because the Bible is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.

0:13:08.580,0:13:13.700
What is tool? - The Word of God.

0:13:13.700,0:13:22.780
Before reading the Bible, you need to seek the attention of who?

0:13:22.780,0:13:24.000
- The Holy Spirit.

0:13:24.000,0:13:33.660
Because the Bible itself, I mean, the Word of God itself is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.

0:13:33.660,0:13:37.440
You cannot use it without the Holy Spirit.

0:13:37.440,0:13:42.420
It's a weapon and instrument in His hand.

0:13:42.420,0:13:45.700
The Holy Spirit is a Communicator.

0:13:45.700,0:13:55.500
When you open the Book of Romans 9:1, our conscience is the communication point.

0:13:55.500,0:14:05.600
The Holy Spirit is a Communicator and our heart is a contact point.

0:14:05.600,0:14:10.100
I mean, our heart is a communication point.

0:14:10.100,0:14:17.860
He cannot share with a heart full of bitterness.

0:14:17.860,0:14:24.760
He cannot share with a heart full of unforgiveness.

0:14:24.760,0:14:29.540
He cannot share with a heart full of hatred,

0:14:29.540,0:14:36.560
bad feelings towards others, your neighbour - the Holy Spirit cannot share with such a heart.

0:14:36.560,0:14:42.280
Can you see where your challenges and problems are coming from?

0:14:42.280,0:14:44.120
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:44.120,0:14:54.600
The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart full of hatred, unforgiveness,

0:14:54.600,0:15:06.540
bitterness, envy, jealousy - the Holy Spirit cannot share with such a heart.

0:15:06.540,0:15:13.060
Can you see the reason why you cannot invite the Holy Spirit to your heart?

0:15:13.060,0:15:24.620
To all the hearts that are in bondage - be free!

0:15:24.620,0:15:27.380
Bondage of unforgiveness - be free!

0:15:27.380,0:15:31.140
Bondage of envy, jealousy - be free!

0:15:31.140,0:15:34.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:34.940,0:15:40.220
Without the freedom, liberty of your heart, you are just wasting your time;

0:15:40.220,0:15:43.760
you are calling the god you do not know.

0:15:43.760,0:15:44.720
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:44.720,0:15:51.120
If you hold grudges towards your neighbour,

0:15:51.120,0:16:04.580
you should not be surprised if the Bible has no meaning to you.

0:16:04.580,0:16:09.740
You can read your Bible hundred times.

0:16:09.740,0:16:16.760
As long as you hold grudges against anyone -

0:16:16.760,0:16:28.420
I mean bad feelings towards others, your neighbour - the Bible has no meaning to you.

0:16:28.420,0:16:30.980
Can you see the Bible you are carrying?

0:16:30.980,0:16:34.940
It is such a sensitive of being.

0:16:34.940,0:16:37.860
Such a sensitive of what? - Being.

0:16:37.860,0:16:42.140
Very sensitive.

0:16:42.140,0:16:44.380
Because it is the book of the Holy Spirit.

0:16:44.380,0:16:47.660
Reading the Bible, reading the Holy Spirit.

0:16:47.660,0:16:53.440
Easily hurt by lack of attention and regard.

0:16:53.440,0:16:57.580
Without the Bible, what else again? How will you talk to God? How will you have access to God?

0:16:57.580,0:16:59.580
Without the Bible...

0:16:59.580,0:17:01.840
It is our standard.

0:17:01.840,0:17:07.040
Let's ask ourselves a question.

0:17:07.040,0:17:15.220
Why does the Bible not come alive to some of us nowadays?

0:17:15.220,0:17:19.840
Can somebody answer the question?

0:17:19.840,0:17:22.460
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:17:22.460,0:17:25.920
Because we don't know the importance of the Bible,

0:17:25.920,0:17:32.640
we always read the Bible with burdens, grudges, hatred.

0:17:32.640,0:17:34.120
Thank you.

0:17:34.120,0:17:37.000
Did you listen to that? Simple.

0:17:37.000,0:17:50.160
The Bible can no longer come alive because we read the Bible with so much unforgiveness,

0:17:50.160,0:17:53.460
envy and jealousy.

0:17:53.460,0:18:02.000
The Bible no longer comes alive because of the unforgiveness.

0:18:02.000,0:18:03.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:18:03.140,0:18:20.780
The Bible can no longer come alive because of the unforgiveness we hold,

0:18:20.780,0:18:24.940
bitterness, envy and jealousy.

0:18:24.940,0:18:31.680
We read with so much unforgiving spirit.

0:18:31.680,0:18:34.980
Where are we going from here?

0:18:34.980,0:18:41.760
Where there is no Bible, there is no Christianity.

0:18:41.760,0:18:44.720
Where there is no Bible, there is no believer.

0:18:44.720,0:18:47.120
Where there is no Bible, there is no born-again.

0:18:47.120,0:18:49.580
We are trapped now.

0:18:49.580,0:18:54.700
How do we get out of this captivity?

0:18:54.700,0:19:00.580
Advice.

0:19:00.580,0:19:06.500
Read the Bible as often as possible.

0:19:06.500,0:19:07.540
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:07.540,0:19:11.560
Read the Bible as often as possible.

0:19:11.560,0:19:23.900
Keep meditating on it until it becomes reailty to you.

0:19:23.900,0:19:27.900
Meditating, meditating.

0:19:27.900,0:19:34.880
You may not get it at first when you read.

0:19:34.880,0:19:38.780
You may not understand it at first when you read.

0:19:38.780,0:19:49.680
That is why you have to continue to meditate on it until it becomes reality.

0:19:49.680,0:19:58.000
You may not get it the first time you read; keep meditating.

0:19:58.000,0:20:06.100
Read it slowly, attentively and repeatedly.

0:20:06.100,0:20:10.980
Your understanding of what you read may not be the understanding of the Holy Spirit.

0:20:10.980,0:20:14.120
You need the attention of the Holy Spirit.

0:20:14.120,0:20:22.840
That is why you read slowly, attentively and repeatedly.

0:20:22.840,0:20:47.940
Even though our reason may reject it, let our heart crave for it.

0:20:47.940,0:20:49.620
Do you know one thing?

0:20:49.620,0:20:53.640
Finally.

0:20:53.640,0:21:00.580
The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient

0:21:00.580,0:21:08.180
but He does not necessarily reward good people, smart people like we are.

0:21:08.180,0:21:12.900
We are very good, smart in reading the Bible.

0:21:12.900,0:21:23.260
He does not necessarily reward good people, smart people, clever people, wealthy people;

0:21:23.260,0:21:30.920
He rewards obedient people.

0:21:30.920,0:21:38.200
The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.

0:21:38.200,0:21:47.180
He does not necessarily reward smart people, clever people, good people, wealthy people.

0:21:47.180,0:21:53.580
You know, we are very smart, very good, very clever, wealthy.

0:21:53.580,0:22:00.920
He does not necessarily reward them.

0:22:00.920,0:22:05.140
He rewards obedient people.

0:22:05.140,0:22:07.160
Trust and obey.

0:22:07.160,0:22:10.980
When we walk with the Lord

0:22:10.980,0:22:15.360
In the light of His Word

0:22:15.360,0:22:23.060
What a glory He sheds on our way

0:22:23.060,0:22:27.780
While we do His good will

0:22:27.780,0:22:32.800
He abides with us still

0:22:32.800,0:22:40.880
And with all who will trust and obey

0:22:40.880,0:22:45.340
Trust and obey

0:22:45.340,0:22:50.500
For there's no other way

0:22:50.500,0:22:56.980
To be happy in Jesus

0:22:56.980,0:23:04.320
But to trust and obey

0:23:04.320,0:23:05.800
Tell your neighbour.

0:23:05.800,0:23:12.540
The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.

0:23:12.540,0:23:13.960
I can't hear you.

0:23:13.960,0:23:17.700
The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.

0:23:17.700,0:23:25.760
He does not necessarily reward good people like you.

0:23:25.760,0:23:32.960
He does not necessarily reward smart people like you.

0:23:32.960,0:23:39.680
He does not necessarily reward a clever person like you.

0:23:39.680,0:23:45.820
He does not necessarily reward wealthy people like you.

0:23:45.820,0:23:51.520
He rewards obedient people.

0:23:51.520,0:23:54.220
Final advice.

0:23:54.220,0:24:02.700
The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.

0:24:02.700,0:24:10.340
He does not necessarily reward good people, brilliant people,

0:24:10.340,0:24:14.420
smart people, clever people, wealthy people.

0:24:14.420,0:24:18.980
Just talk - just name any adjective.

0:24:18.980,0:24:21.800
But He rewards obedient people.

That is why fishermen were among his disciples.

0:24:32.080,0:24:38.020
Rustic people followed Him.

0:24:38.020,0:24:49.080
And you know what it took Paul to succeed - to become what he was.

0:24:49.080,0:24:54.500
So, when we are reading the Bible, put your knowledge aside.

0:24:54.500,0:24:59.920
There's a difference between supernatural and human natural gifts.

0:24:59.920,0:25:04.400
And we all know those things that follow human natural gifts -

0:25:04.400,0:25:11.520
talent, gift and education are under human natural gifts.

0:25:11.520,0:25:15.500
That is why people like me can be here.

0:25:15.500,0:25:24.400
If the reward was for the good, smart, clever, brilliant, I would not be in the position I am today.

Tell your neighbour once again.

0:25:32.700,0:25:39.800
The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.

0:25:39.800,0:25:51.180
He does not necessarily reward good people, clever people, smart people,

0:25:51.180,0:25:55.420
brilliant people, wealthy people.

0:25:55.420,0:25:59.580
He rewards the obedient.

0:25:59.580,0:26:02.340
Trust and obey.

0:26:52.740,0:27:03.180
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

0:27:03.180,0:27:13.480
I am strong when I am on your shoulders

0:27:13.480,0:27:23.620
You raise me up to more than I can be

0:27:23.620,0:27:33.680
When I am down and oh my soul so weary

0:27:33.680,0:27:43.640
When troubles come and my heart burdened be

0:27:43.640,0:27:53.940
When I am still and wait here in the silence

0:27:53.940,0:28:01.380
Until You come and stay awhile with me

0:28:01.380,0:28:13.220
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains

0:28:13.220,0:28:23.340

You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

You raise me up to more than I can be

Right now, whatever root of bitterness or unforgiveness that keeps unforgiveness alive -

0:29:32.380,0:29:36.300
be moved, in the name of Jesus!

0:29:36.300,0:29:45.900
That root that keeps unforgiveness alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:29:45.900,0:29:57.240
That root that keeps bitterness alive in you - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:29:57.240,0:30:16.440
That root that keeps envy, bitterness, sin alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:30:16.440,0:30:19.140
There is a root for all this.

0:30:19.140,0:30:23.660
There could be disagreement or whatever.

0:30:23.660,0:30:32.660
That root that keeps them alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:30:32.660,0:30:37.000
You keep saying, "No, no, I don't need to hold offence".

0:30:37.000,0:30:41.500
But before you know it, you hold offence.

0:30:41.500,0:30:44.520
There's a root.

0:30:44.520,0:30:47.700
It may be through help that someone is giving you.

0:30:47.700,0:30:50.100
It may be where you live.

0:30:50.100,0:31:04.740
That root that keeps them alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
