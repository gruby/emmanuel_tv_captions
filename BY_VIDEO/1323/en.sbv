0:00:00.020,0:00:03.900
Give your neighbor a handshake, say:  "Emmanuel"

0:00:03.900,0:00:08.040
Give your other neighbor a handshake, say: "Emmanuel".

0:00:08.040,0:00:12.640
Give the neighbor behind you a handshake, say:  "Emmanuel."

0:00:12.640,0:00:17.320
Give the neighbor in front of you a handshake, say: "Emmanuel."

0:00:17.320,0:00:26.280
And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV: "Emmanuel!!"

0:00:26.280,0:00:32.200
Tell your neighbor: "God is with us."

0:00:32.200,0:00:38.060
Yes, you are welcome once again to the arena of liberty, in Jesus' name.

0:00:38.060,0:00:43.520
Right now, you may have your seats in the presence of God and say: "Thank You, Jesus!"

My name is Brother Chris and I have the wonderful privilege today to share with you

0:00:49.860,0:00:53.940
the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:00:53.940,0:01:01.640
Turn to your neighbor and say: "Neighbor, what a God we have to worship!

0:01:01.640,0:01:05.820
What a Son we have to praise!

0:01:05.820,0:01:10.840
What a future lies before us!"

0:01:10.840,0:01:20.020
Tell your neighbor: "Neighbor, I have a good destiny! I'm a child of promise!

0:01:20.020,0:01:22.580
I have a wonderful future!"

0:01:22.580,0:01:28.500
If you believe that, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:01:28.500,0:01:34.100
Now, to begin today's message, I just want to share with you a very short story.

0:01:34.100,0:01:38.340
This was several years ago. We were having a prayer line service here in the church.

0:01:38.340,0:01:41.660
And you know our prayer line services are very large.

0:01:41.660,0:01:45.700
We had thousands upon thousands of people.

0:01:45.700,0:01:50.980
We were making announcements, trying to arrange people according to the nature of their challenges

0:01:50.980,0:01:54.440
so that we could attend to them as swiftly and quickly as possible.

0:01:54.440,0:01:57.660
I was there at the front with a microphone making these announcements

0:01:57.660,0:02:02.380
and it got to a part where I said: "Anyone here who is a pregnant woman?

0:02:02.380,0:02:07.200
All pregnant women who have come for the safe delivery of their babies, please come out!"

0:02:07.200,0:02:12.020
So of course, you see these heavily pregnant women coming forward -

0:02:12.020,0:02:15.740
8 to 9 months pregnant - getting ready because they came for prayer.

0:02:15.740,0:02:21.020
But in the midst of the women, I saw a man.

0:02:21.020,0:02:24.460
I looked twice and thought: "This is definitely a man.

0:02:24.460,0:02:26.780
Let me have a bit of a joke here."

0:02:26.780,0:02:31.560
So I announced:  "Please, we did not announce for pregnant men.

0:02:31.560,0:02:33.680
We announced for pregnant women.

0:02:33.680,0:02:37.160
If you are a pregnant man, please go back to your seat."

0:02:37.160,0:02:39.680
And the man truly went back to his seat.

0:02:39.680,0:02:45.160
Afterwards, I thought: "Why would this man join the pregnant women that came forward?"

0:02:45.160,0:02:50.840
After this I said: "Okay, now, if we do have any pregnant men here, you can come forward."

0:02:50.840,0:02:55.380
Do you know what happened? The man came forward - a young man.

0:02:55.380,0:02:59.680
I looked at him and said: "Is this guy okay?"

0:02:59.680,0:03:05.980
Because stature-wise, he's of normal stature and I've never heard of a pregnant man.

0:03:05.980,0:03:10.280
But you know, in this our generation anything is possible.

0:03:10.280,0:03:12.360
I said, "Let me ask this man".

0:03:12.360,0:03:15.680
So this man walked boldly forward; he's a pregnant man.

0:03:15.680,0:03:20.680
I said: "Sir, do you mean to say that you are pregnant?"

0:03:20.680,0:03:24.320
He looked at me and said: "Yes."

0:03:24.320,0:03:27.320
I said, "You don't look very pregnant".

0:03:27.320,0:03:30.740
He said, "I'm pregnant with a bright future!"

0:03:30.740,0:03:35.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:35.960,0:03:38.680
So I now said: "Okay. What do you need prayer for then?"

0:03:38.680,0:03:44.500
He said: "I need prayer for the safe delivery of my dream!"

0:03:44.500,0:03:48.480
I now tricked him and said: "Okay, where is your medical report?"

0:03:48.480,0:03:51.200
He said: "Oga, I don't have a medical report.

0:03:51.200,0:03:56.080
But I need prayer because I have a bright future and I need to be released into that future."

0:03:56.080,0:03:59.140
Long story short, because of that bold step,

0:03:59.140,0:04:01.500
that man went to the prayer line that day.

0:04:01.500,0:04:07.380
And I'm very sure wherever he is, he has a wonderful testimony to share.

0:04:07.380,0:04:10.980
Why am I saying this little story?

0:04:10.980,0:04:15.180
First and foremost, I want to tell everyone here, viewers all over the world,

0:04:15.180,0:04:20.420
that God has given you a good destiny.

0:04:20.420,0:04:23.440
This is not a matter of "Amen". It's a fact.

0:04:23.440,0:04:26.680
You're "Amen" cannot change it. It's the truth.

0:04:26.680,0:04:30.660
God has given you a good destiny.

0:04:30.660,0:04:38.220
You have been given a unique place in God's master plan.

0:04:38.220,0:04:43.620
You have a unique path towards your divine destiny

0:04:43.620,0:04:50.640
and you are in a unique position to make a difference in your world.

0:04:50.640,0:04:53.540
Tell your neighbor: "I have a bright future."

0:04:53.540,0:04:56.300
Tell your neighbor: "I have a good destiny."

0:04:56.300,0:05:00.460
Listen, I don't care what lies satan has whispered to you -

0:05:00.460,0:05:03.920
that you're not good enough, you're not strong enough, you're not smart enough,

0:05:03.920,0:05:07.120
look at your past, your past life is too bad, you can't make it.

0:05:07.120,0:05:11.460
I don't care what society has told you, the restrictions they have placed on you -

0:05:11.460,0:05:15.520
they say because of your gender, because of your age, because of your education,

0:05:15.520,0:05:17.980
because of your family background, you can't make it.

0:05:17.980,0:05:20.800
That's a lie from the pit of hell!

0:05:20.800,0:05:27.460
You have been given a good destiny! Believe it!

0:05:27.460,0:05:40.880
This brings us to one of life's greatest tragedies: unfulfilled destinies.

0:05:40.880,0:05:51.920
Do you know how many people who are destined kings are roaming on the streets today,

0:05:51.920,0:06:04.800
destined leaders who are spending their lives unnoticed, uncelebrated and in obscurity,

0:06:04.800,0:06:12.160
people who are destined to be great but have gone to the grave prematurely?

0:06:12.160,0:06:17.020
Tell your neighbor: "It´s very painful."

0:06:17.020,0:06:20.660
It's very very painful.

0:06:20.660,0:06:26.320
The truth is, brethren, we all shout, "Amen!" and get excited when we hear we have a good destiny

0:06:26.320,0:06:31.180
but successful people don't just drift to the top.

0:06:31.180,0:06:35.940
We live in a world where the enemy of our souls

0:06:35.940,0:06:45.040
will not just allow the purpose of God, our divine destiny to be fulfilled without putting up a fight.

0:06:45.040,0:06:49.400
He's not going to just let you walk into your destiny without putting up a fight.

0:06:49.400,0:06:58.780
So today, we're going to talk about one of his most important strategies and tactics.

0:06:58.780,0:07:06.180
The easiest way for satan to derail you from your destiny

0:07:06.180,0:07:12.900
is to connect you with people who are not serious about theirs.

0:07:12.900,0:07:14.580
I'm going to say it again.

0:07:14.580,0:07:24.620
The easiest way for satan - our enemy, the enemy of our souls - to derail you from your destiny

0:07:24.620,0:07:31.360
is to connect you with people who are not serious about theirs.

0:07:31.360,0:07:38.820
This will bring us to the title of today's message: "Make friends with your future."

0:07:38.820,0:07:47.860
Tell your neighbor. Say, "Neighbor, make friends with your future".

0:07:47.860,0:07:52.220
Now, let's first of all try and understand what we mean when we talk about relationships.

0:07:52.220,0:07:55.340
We know natural human relationships are very important.

0:07:55.340,0:08:00.180
Everything God created requires a connection:

0:08:00.180,0:08:05.280
You are because I am; I am because you are - we need each other.

0:08:05.280,0:08:09.180
God has designed it in this way so that no man should boast.

0:08:09.180,0:08:13.720
We need God but we need good people, inspired people, informed people

0:08:13.720,0:08:17.620
to make it in our respective callings.

0:08:17.620,0:08:21.740
The question is: Who are the type of people that surround you?

0:08:21.740,0:08:25.380
Now, I want to hear from someone in the audience.

0:08:25.380,0:08:28.240
Just feel free to answer this question.

0:08:28.240,0:08:30.400
If you know the answer, just raise up your hand.

0:08:30.400,0:08:34.460
How would you define a friend?

0:08:34.460,0:08:37.640
What is the meaning of real friendship?

0:08:37.640,0:08:41.020
Anyone who would like to answer this question, just raise up your hand.

0:08:41.020,0:08:42.380
Okay.

0:08:42.380,0:08:44.260
My brother here, good.

0:08:44.260,0:08:49.440
How would you define a friend - a true friend?

0:08:49.440,0:08:55.440
A friend is someone who supports you, who shares your dream with you, who walks with you.

0:08:55.440,0:08:58.180
Okay, let's put our hands together for our brother.

0:08:58.180,0:08:59.680
It's a good answer. Anyone else?

0:08:59.680,0:09:03.980
Anyone else from over here wants to explain the meaning of a  friend?

0:09:03.980,0:09:07.040
Okay, madam. Thank you.

0:09:07.040,0:09:08.100
Kind and friendly.

0:09:08.100,0:09:10.580
Okay, someone who is kind and friendly. Fine.

0:09:10.580,0:09:13.800
Anyone else? How would you define a friend?

0:09:13.800,0:09:15.720
A true friend? A good friend?

0:09:15.720,0:09:19.000
Okay, madam. Thank you.

0:09:19.000,0:09:25.840
A friend is someone who is with you during happiness, during problems, when you are sick,

0:09:25.840,0:09:31.100
at every point of time in life when you are in problems, sickness, he is with you,

0:09:31.100,0:09:33.340
he shares with you everything.

0:09:33.340,0:09:37.780
Okay, someone who is with you in both good and hard times, correct?

0:09:37.780,0:09:41.880
Let's open our Bibles because I'm going to read a couple of Scriptures

0:09:41.880,0:09:48.740
that give scriptural basis and understanding of what true friendship is all about.

0:09:48.740,0:09:54.340
The first Scripture we are going to read is in the Book of Proverbs 27.

0:09:54.340,0:10:01.620
So turn with me to Proverbs 27:17.

0:10:01.620,0:10:07.120
And let's see what the Bible says about this very essential and important topic.

0:10:07.120,0:10:13.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:13.120,0:10:19.940
Proverbs 27:17.

0:10:19.940,0:10:22.020
And it reads:

0:10:22.020,0:10:29.180
"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."

0:10:29.180,0:10:34.220
Alright. It's in line with the definitions that our brethren have been giving.

0:10:34.220,0:10:41.780
Let's quickly go to Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 and it reads:

0:10:41.780,0:10:47.064
"Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor:

0:10:47.064,0:10:56.100
If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.

0:10:56.100,0:11:01.680
But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up."

0:11:01.680,0:11:10.980
Quickly rush to Galatians 6:2.

0:11:10.980,0:11:11.840
It says:

0:11:11.840,0:11:19.980
"Carry each other's burdens and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ."

0:11:19.980,0:11:23.820
Based on these Scriptures and indeed in line with the answers that our brethren have given,

0:11:23.820,0:11:26.740
we can define friendship in this way:

0:11:26.740,0:11:38.060
A true friend is someone who helps you in your weaknesses and encourages you in your strengths.

0:11:38.060,0:11:44.600
Once again: A true friend is someone who helps you in your weaknesses

0:11:44.600,0:11:49.340
and encourages you in your strengths.

0:11:49.340,0:11:51.660
Now, I want to challenge you today.

0:11:51.660,0:11:59.120
In the light of this definition, examine the people that are close to you -

0:11:59.120,0:12:06.480
that you interact with, that you move with, that you spend time with on a daily basis

0:12:06.480,0:12:13.060
because you are what you are by virtue of the company you keep.

0:12:13.060,0:12:24.320
Say: "Neighbor, you are what you are by virtue of the company you keep".

0:12:24.320,0:12:30.080
We should never underestimate the power of influence.

0:12:30.080,0:12:33.740
Ask yourself: Are the people that you're friends with

0:12:33.740,0:12:40.800
helping you in your weaknesses or using your weaknesses against you?

0:12:40.800,0:12:48.320
Are they people who are having a positive influence on you or a negative influence on you?

0:12:48.320,0:12:51.440
Because a little example has a big influence.

0:12:51.440,0:12:56.820
A couple of years ago, there was a young lady who received deliverance here at The SCOAN.

0:12:56.820,0:13:00.240
She was a Nigerian, her parents were Nigerians

0:13:00.240,0:13:02.360
but she was born and brought up in the UK.

0:13:02.360,0:13:07.680
After her deliverance, we had the opportunity to listen to her life experiences.

0:13:07.680,0:13:10.420
And during the course of sharing her life experiences,

0:13:10.420,0:13:13.200
she said something that shocked me and I want to share it with you.

0:13:13.200,0:13:22.700
She said that at the age of sixteen, she had had two children for two different fathers.

0:13:22.700,0:13:24.640
16 years old.

0:13:24.640,0:13:29.560
When she said this, I was the one to ask the question. I said: "Just can you tell me why?

0:13:29.560,0:13:32.980
At that age, what prompted you to take such a step?"

0:13:32.980,0:13:34.180
Do you know what she replied?

0:13:34.180,0:13:41.360
She said: "Because it was the fashionable thing to do."

0:13:41.360,0:13:46.720
She said: "In my class in school, all of the girls were having kids.

0:13:46.720,0:13:48.820
That was the normal thing.

0:13:48.820,0:13:55.760
That was what you had to do to feel part of the class, the clique."

0:13:55.760,0:14:01.880
I'm not saying this to stand on a high horse, judge and condemn - "How can this person do such a thing?"

0:14:01.880,0:14:06.260
No. I'm trying to tell you the power of influence.

0:14:06.260,0:14:09.080
A young girl taking such a drastic step.

0:14:09.080,0:14:12.000
Just because she wants to feel part of the society.

0:14:12.000,0:14:15.620
She said: "That was the fashionable thing. That was what everyone was doing.

0:14:15.620,0:14:20.620
That was what was happening with her peers and the people in her age group.

0:14:20.620,0:14:23.560
16 years old.

0:14:23.560,0:14:29.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:29.500,0:14:42.920
Every relationship you have either nurtures or nourishes a strength or weakness within you.

0:14:42.920,0:14:51.000
Every relationship nourishes a strength or weakness within you.

0:14:51.000,0:14:56.420
Look, as human beings, we all have some dormant character traits.

0:14:56.420,0:15:00.040
When I say dormant, I mean, they are there, but they are unused.

0:15:00.040,0:15:07.100
But these dormant character traits are nourished by the kind of company we keep.

0:15:07.100,0:15:11.500
If you keep company with people that will improve your life,

0:15:11.500,0:15:14.740
the dormant strength in you will be nurtured.

0:15:14.740,0:15:18.660
You keep company with those who will decrease your life,

0:15:18.660,0:15:26.400
the dormant weaknesses, vices in you will be nurtured and the strength will be decreased.

0:15:26.400,0:15:32.040
Who are the people you are moving with, you are close to, you are friends with?

0:15:32.040,0:15:36.760
I want to make an observation and I believe if you examine yourself and examine society,

0:15:36.760,0:15:38.400
you would agree with me.

0:15:38.400,0:15:51.280
Today, it appears that people's weaknesses are what connected them together as friends.

0:15:51.280,0:15:55.900
I'll give an example. I'll try and explain it to you.

0:15:55.900,0:16:03.640
Most of the time, if you see people who are smoking, their friends are smokers.

0:16:03.640,0:16:05.460
Would you agree with me?

0:16:05.460,0:16:10.780
Most of the time, if you see people that are drunkards, their friends are drinking.

0:16:10.780,0:16:14.820
You see people that talk too much - they are friends with people who talk too much.

0:16:14.820,0:16:18.540
Tell me how you will stop talking too much.

0:16:18.540,0:16:20.260
Let's be honest with ourselves.

0:16:20.260,0:16:24.020
Is there anyone here who has the weakness of talking too much?

0:16:24.020,0:16:26.700
If you're honest, just raise your hand.

0:16:26.700,0:16:28.880
Some people are not honest.

0:16:28.880,0:16:31.280
You have the weakness of talking too much.

0:16:31.280,0:16:33.720
Okay, madam, come. Come out.

0:16:33.720,0:16:36.940
Who is another person? You too?  Come.  The second person.

0:16:36.940,0:16:39.480
Some people quickly put their hand down.

0:16:39.480,0:16:44.080
The second person I talked to - okay, madam, come.

0:16:44.080,0:16:46.660
Now, you have a problem. You acknowledge it.

0:16:46.660,0:16:49.340
It's good. Acknowledging your weakness is 50% of the victory.

0:16:49.340,0:16:51.960
Once you can acknowledge you have a problem, the way out has come.

0:16:51.960,0:16:55.740
You acknowledge that you sometimes talk too much.

0:16:55.740,0:16:57.420
Yes, sir, I do.

0:16:57.420,0:17:01.200
Madam, you too. You acknowledge that you talk too much.

0:17:01.200,0:17:02.260
Yes.

0:17:02.260,0:17:06.820
Now, look at this. She talks too much - she talks too much.

0:17:06.820,0:17:14.140
If these two people are friends, tell me how they will stop talking too much.

0:17:14.140,0:17:16.780
It's not possible!

0:17:16.780,0:17:21.240
They are friends. This weakness is meeting this weakness.

0:17:21.240,0:17:24.840
If you add weakness to weakness, you produce more weakness.

0:17:24.840,0:17:27.400
Okay, if you realize that you talk too much,

0:17:27.400,0:17:30.080
who is the kind of person that you should look for as a friend?

0:17:30.080,0:17:32.400
A quiet and more reserved person.

0:17:32.400,0:17:39.780
A quiet and more reserved person so that their strength can help her weakness.

0:17:39.780,0:17:41.520
That is friendship.

0:17:41.520,0:17:44.780
But today, we look for people who have the same weakness as us.

0:17:44.780,0:17:46.920
You are a gossip - you're friends with gossips.

0:17:46.920,0:17:49.640
You have anger issues - you marry someone that has anger issues.

0:17:49.640,0:17:57.200
Tell me why you will not have hypertension.

0:17:57.200,0:18:01.580
You see, you look for people ... it's our weaknesses that connect us with people,

0:18:01.580,0:18:05.080
instead of looking for someone who is strong where you are weak,

0:18:05.080,0:18:07.700
someone who has what you don't have

0:18:07.700,0:18:12.880
so that you can learn from them and they can learn from you and you can become a better person.

0:18:12.880,0:18:18.500
Tell your neighbor: "Make friends with your future."

0:18:18.500,0:18:23.060
Tell your other neighbor: "Make friends with your future."

0:18:23.060,0:18:25.980
Do you know the reason I'm saying you should make friends with your future?

0:18:25.980,0:18:34.140
When you make friends with your future, your future will help you make the right friends.

0:18:34.140,0:18:40.280
You will not start meeting people that are going to end up dividing and subtracting from your life.

0:18:40.280,0:18:42.920
Thank you very much. I appreciate your honesty. You can go back to your seat.

0:18:42.920,0:18:46.760
Let's put our hands together for them.

0:18:46.760,0:18:51.880
They honestly came out. Just look at yourself as an example. Think about the weakness you have.

0:18:51.880,0:18:56.140
Okay, can someone here - just be honest -  someone tell me your weakness. Anyone, just say it.

0:18:56.140,0:19:00.980
Say it out, your weakness. You can shout it out. I will not give you the mic.

0:19:00.980,0:19:02.840
Anger! Thank you, madam. God bless you.

0:19:02.840,0:19:04.780
Madam says she has the problem of anger.

0:19:04.780,0:19:07.720
She's acknowledging that she has a weakness.

0:19:07.720,0:19:10.560
Ask yourself the kind of people that you're close to.

0:19:10.560,0:19:15.380
If your friends, your close friends, your tight pals also have an issue of anger

0:19:15.380,0:19:20.460
and anger meets anger, what you will have is double trouble.

0:19:20.460,0:19:22.320
More anger.

0:19:22.320,0:19:26.200
You have to look for someone that can calm you down.

0:19:26.200,0:19:28.760
Someone that can help you in your weakness.

0:19:28.760,0:19:33.260
There are four types of people in society.

0:19:33.260,0:19:36.560
There are those who add to your life.

0:19:36.560,0:19:40.240
There are those who subtract from your life.

0:19:40.240,0:19:44.120
There those who  multiply your life

0:19:44.120,0:19:48.260
and there are those who divide your life.

0:19:48.260,0:19:56.400
Your relationship with them will make you or mar you.

0:19:56.400,0:19:58.160
Who are the people you are close to?

0:19:58.160,0:20:02.540
Now, let's be honest with ourselves.

0:20:02.540,0:20:05.060
I'm going to do something a little bit crazy.

0:20:05.060,0:20:08.600
Can everyone here stand up? Everyone here.

0:20:08.600,0:20:11.800
Everyone here stand up and come out here.

0:20:11.800,0:20:14.660
Just come here, everyone.

0:20:14.660,0:20:16.940
Come here and face this way.

0:20:16.940,0:20:18.920
Just come out and face here.

0:20:18.920,0:20:22.580
You can move back a bit.

0:20:22.580,0:20:24.720
Okay.

0:20:24.720,0:20:31.180
Everyone here.

0:20:31.180,0:20:33.340
You guys, move back a little bit.

0:20:33.340,0:20:38.940
Now in your midst - okay, sir, you can just come.

0:20:38.940,0:20:41.760
Tell your neighbor: "Be sincere."

0:20:41.760,0:20:44.000
It's good that we talk to ourselves.

0:20:44.000,0:20:45.900
It's good so that we can acknowledge where we changed.

0:20:45.900,0:20:48.440
Just turn around, sir.

0:20:48.440,0:20:53.320
I'm going to give you a picture of what is happening in our society.

0:20:53.320,0:20:56.620
We said there are four kinds of people in our society.

0:20:56.620,0:21:01.380
Those you add, those who subtract, those who multiply, those who divide.

0:21:01.380,0:21:11.740
If we are sincere, the majority of people fall into the category of those who subtract and divide.

0:21:11.740,0:21:15.160
As my brother is here alone, you see this crowd of people -

0:21:15.160,0:21:19.080
this large crowd that is coming your direction?

0:21:19.080,0:21:24.200
This crowd of people in the world - we're not talking in the House of God -

0:21:24.200,0:21:33.700
in the world, 99% of them divide and subtract.

0:21:33.700,0:21:38.380
Can you see the danger of following the crowd?

0:21:38.380,0:21:42.680
Can you see the danger of following the majority?

0:21:42.680,0:21:46.020
I'll give you an example to explain this.

0:21:46.020,0:21:49.740
Any time you want to do the wrong thing,

0:21:49.740,0:21:53.280
you will find many people out there to encourage you to do it.

0:21:53.280,0:21:56.720
"Go ahead. Yes. No problem. Go ahead. You can do it.  I´ve done it before, it´s fine."

0:21:56.720,0:21:59.160
Many people will encourage you to do the wrong thing.

0:21:59.160,0:22:03.640
But if you want to do the right thing, it's a struggle; it's a battle.

0:22:03.640,0:22:06.360
People will even advise you against doing it.

0:22:06.360,0:22:12.860
You will never find the time to do what is right but you will easily find the time to do what is wrong.

0:22:12.860,0:22:14.200
This is a picture of society.

0:22:14.200,0:22:19.200
Why then do we so often take the opinion of the majority,

0:22:19.200,0:22:23.040
instead of listening to the testimony of our conscience?

0:22:23.040,0:22:26.400
Everyone here is going to walk forward.

0:22:26.400,0:22:28.240
My brother is going to walk this way.

0:22:28.240,0:22:30.020
When I say stop. I just want you to stop.

0:22:30.020,0:22:32.280
Okay, let's go. Everyone walk, you walk.

0:22:32.280,0:22:37.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:37.640,0:22:40.260
Stop!

0:22:40.260,0:22:43.340
Where is my brother?

0:22:43.340,0:22:45.620
I've lost him in here.

0:22:45.620,0:22:50.120
Just raise up your hand, sir.

0:22:50.120,0:22:53.840
Can you identify with this scenario?

0:22:53.840,0:23:01.060
So many times it seems as if the whole world is going this way and we are trying to go the other way.

0:23:01.060,0:23:07.660
And it's the easiest thing in the world to succumb and say: "Let me just join the crowd going this way."

0:23:07.660,0:23:11.020
It's so much easier. It's more convenient. It's more comfortable

0:23:11.020,0:23:12.720
The whole crowd can just go this way.

0:23:12.720,0:23:17.320
But the Bible says: "You are destined to be one with a difference."

0:23:17.320,0:23:21.900
How can you be one with a difference when you follow the majority?

0:23:21.900,0:23:29.960
And you know that the majority, if we're sincere, are heading towards failure.

0:23:29.960,0:23:36.320
You have to take a different direction to achieve a different solution.

0:23:36.320,0:23:43.940
Everyone keep walking. Keep walking.

0:23:43.940,0:23:47.480
Stop!

0:23:47.480,0:23:56.200
This is a picture of how our lives, as people of God should be.

0:23:56.200,0:23:58.980
We don´t follow the majority!

0:23:58.980,0:24:05.060
We don't look to the opinion of others before taking a stand or taking a step.

0:24:05.060,0:24:09.180
We don't do things because people want us to do them, because we want to be popular,

0:24:09.180,0:24:12.720
because we want to be relevant, because we want to be famous.

0:24:12.720,0:24:16.720
We don't look for friends because we want to be part of the society.

0:24:16.720,0:24:23.400
We look for our future and our future will bring the right friends to us.

0:24:29.260,0:24:31.480
Young people...

0:24:31.480,0:24:36.380
So many young people today go to school, college, university.

0:24:36.380,0:24:40.040
This is a place that is supposed to connect them to their future.

0:24:40.040,0:24:42.920
A place where they are supposed to catch their future.

0:24:42.920,0:24:46.080
But instead, satan catches them.

0:24:46.080,0:24:51.600
Why? Because you go to school, college, university - you want to be part of the crowd.

0:24:51.600,0:24:55.560
You want to be part of the popular group, popular society.

0:24:55.560,0:24:57.600
You do what they do, you go where they go,

0:24:57.600,0:25:00.460
you wear the same clothes they wear, the same makeup they wear.

0:25:00.460,0:25:05.420
And don't be surprised, at the end of the day, your life looks like them - failure!

0:25:05.420,0:25:08.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:08.880,0:25:11.820
Let's put our hands together for everyone!

0:25:11.820,0:25:14.340
You can go back to your seats.

0:25:14.340,0:25:18.800
I'm very sorry. I know you want altar fruits but I can't give everyone altar fruits.

0:25:18.800,0:25:20.960
So we have to give you in the spirit.

0:25:20.960,0:25:25.880
Just receive it by faith because we cannot give everyone.

0:25:25.880,0:25:32.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:32.500,0:25:39.000
Tell your neighbor, say: "Neighbor, choose your friends with care

0:25:39.000,0:25:45.140
because you will become what they are."

0:25:45.140,0:25:49.320
Once again, I want to challenge you.

0:25:49.320,0:25:58.940
Use this message and examine your life in the light of this message.

0:25:58.940,0:26:07.460
Are you friends with people who are encouraging your strength and helping you in your weaknesses

0:26:07.460,0:26:14.780
or are you moving with people who are taking you back to your past -

0:26:14.780,0:26:19.140
people who have the same problem as you,  the same challenge as you?

0:26:19.140,0:26:22.620
You are depressed and you are moving with someone who is depressed.

0:26:22.620,0:26:25.580
How will you get out of depression?

0:26:25.580,0:26:28.940
You are negative. You have negative opinions of people.

0:26:28.940,0:26:31.920
You always speak negatively, think negatively and talk negatively

0:26:31.920,0:26:34.040
and you are moving with negative people.

0:26:34.040,0:26:37.620
You will continue to be an embodiment of negativity.

0:26:37.620,0:26:43.060
You have to look for people who are strong where you are weak.

0:26:43.060,0:26:46.080
Look for people who have what you don't have.

0:26:46.080,0:26:48.760
Look for your future.

0:26:48.760,0:26:55.200
When I talk about your future, your destiny, I'm referring to God

0:26:55.200,0:27:00.140
because God is the Owner of our destiny; God is the Author of our future.

0:27:00.140,0:27:03.500
There is no other vehicle we can take that will take us to our destiny

0:27:03.500,0:27:06.440
apart from God and His fruit and His Word.

0:27:06.440,0:27:09.140
Love is the vehicle that will take you to your destiny.

0:27:09.140,0:27:13.760
Why then are you friends with people who celebrate hatred?

0:27:13.760,0:27:16.540
Joy is the vehicle that will take you to your destiny.

0:27:16.540,0:27:21.700
Why then are you close to friends, people who are sad all the time

0:27:21.700,0:27:23.740
and look at life from a negative perspective?

0:27:23.740,0:27:28.040
Even when you share an idea with them, they will look down on it, look down on you,

0:27:28.040,0:27:32.840
discourage you, dishearten you and dampen your spirits.

0:27:32.840,0:27:36.940
You say you have the problem of lust or you're part of a whatsapp group

0:27:36.940,0:27:41.500
that is sharing pornographic contents and you download it every day.

0:27:41.500,0:27:47.300
Leave the group if you want to leave that lust.

0:27:47.300,0:27:49.580
Connect to your future.

0:27:49.580,0:27:53.880
The ball is in your court.

0:27:53.880,0:28:02.060
If you make friends with your future, put your future first, value next more than now.

0:28:02.060,0:28:05.600
Don't spoil tomorrow for the sake of today.

0:28:05.600,0:28:13.560
Don't sacrifice your future for the sake of looking good in the present.

0:28:13.560,0:28:21.520
Don't end up becoming just another statistic

0:28:21.520,0:28:28.160
when you were born to be one with a difference - to make a difference in your world.

0:28:28.160,0:28:43.260
As I come to a conclusion of this message, I want to share with you something personal

0:28:43.260,0:28:49.620
that makes this message so much more of a reality for me.

0:28:49.620,0:28:57.840
When I first came to The SCOAN at the age of 13,

0:28:57.840,0:29:01.980
I had the privilege of meeting Prophet T.B. Joshua in his office.

0:29:01.980,0:29:05.640
At that time, I was not so serious about the things of God.

0:29:05.640,0:29:09.860
Yes, I was from a Christian home and loved the things of God

0:29:09.860,0:29:17.580
but I was struggling to balance my Christian life and school, and friends and negative influence.

0:29:17.580,0:29:24.360
After Prophet T.B. Joshua greeted me, he said a sentence that I will remember for the rest of my life.

0:29:24.360,0:29:36.080
He looked at me and said, "If you want to follow Jesus, you need to leave your friends".

0:29:36.080,0:29:47.340
I was 13 years old and that single word changed my life.

0:29:47.340,0:29:48.960
Do you know the reason why I say that?

0:29:48.960,0:29:53.500
At that time, the school I was attending was a very good school academically

0:29:53.500,0:30:00.100
but I was the only person who identified himself as a Christian in my class.

0:30:00.100,0:30:04.220
And although, yes, I wasn't rebelling and doing every terrible bad thing

0:30:04.220,0:30:09.740
but I was living a double life: one life at home in a church, another life in school -

0:30:09.740,0:30:12.900
trying to please people, trying to please God.

0:30:12.900,0:30:18.220
And the man of God in a single statement prophetically identified this.

0:30:18.220,0:30:24.280
The next year, I actually had to leave that school and move to a completely different school

0:30:24.280,0:30:30.560
that was a Christian school so that I would be able to fulfill what the man of God said.

0:30:30.560,0:30:35.220
If not for that word, I don't believe I would even be here today

0:30:35.220,0:30:39.320
because the negative influence was so much!

0:30:39.320,0:30:45.560
Why am I saying this example to back up the importance of this message?

0:30:45.560,0:30:55.280
I want to let you know, brethren, that whatever you lose for God´s sake, you will regain a thousandfold.

0:30:55.280,0:31:00.360
Some of you may be hearing this message and upon sober reflection and self-examination

0:31:00.360,0:31:07.080
realize that there are some people that you need to disconnect from.

0:31:07.080,0:31:12.540
There are some people you need to distance yourself from.

0:31:12.540,0:31:19.380
I want to assure you that if you take that step, you will not regret it.

0:31:19.380,0:31:24.840
Your future is more important than your image.

0:31:24.840,0:31:29.320
Where you are going is more important than just what you are doing now.

0:31:29.320,0:31:34.140
But remember, it's what you are doing that will give birth to where you are going.

0:31:34.140,0:31:37.220
Your destiny must influence your decisions

0:31:37.220,0:31:40.760
for your decisions to take you on the road to your destiny.

0:31:40.760,0:31:44.880
Your destiny does not permit you to move with people

0:31:44.880,0:31:49.940
who waste time on things that have no lasting value and significance;

0:31:49.940,0:31:55.480
people that are only going to discourage you, distract you, dishearten you.

0:31:55.480,0:32:05.900
Be someone that makes a difference in your world by making friends with your future.

0:32:05.900,0:32:10.740
In conclusion.

0:32:10.740,0:32:16.580
In order not to end up like the masses out there who are merely wandering,

0:32:16.580,0:32:25.120
unsure of their dreams and goals, make friends with your future.

0:32:25.120,0:32:29.760
Choose your friends with care.

0:32:29.760,0:32:32.380
Don't just be too quick to trust.

0:32:32.380,0:32:35.600
Don't be too quick to give your heart cheaply to someone

0:32:35.600,0:32:38.540
because you'll just set yourself up for disappointment.

0:32:38.540,0:32:43.480
Don't trade issues with people who are not serious about their future;

0:32:43.480,0:32:47.000
you'll just set yourself up for destruction.

0:32:47.000,0:32:51.380
Don't look for people who have the same weakness as you;

0:32:51.380,0:32:56.440
look for people who are strong where you are weak.

0:32:56.440,0:33:00.380
That is the meaning of true friendship.

0:33:00.380,0:33:03.300
Where you are weak, I am strong.

0:33:03.300,0:33:06.900
Where I am weak, you are strong.

0:33:06.900,0:33:09.800
Iron sharpens iron.

This is the decision of a champion - a decision that will benefit your future.

0:33:28.920,0:33:35.140
So let your words, your actions, your interactions, your associations, your friends,

0:33:35.140,0:33:43.380
the people you move with - let everything about you become a photograph of the future you desire

0:33:43.380,0:33:46.660
instead of the future you fear.

0:33:46.660,0:33:52.900
Then you will become who God has destined you to be, in Jesus' name.

0:33:52.900,0:34:00.740
May God bless His word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
