0:00:00.300,0:00:01.620
Thank you.

0:00:01.620,0:00:03.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:03.560,0:00:05.180
Amen.

0:00:05.180,0:00:09.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:09.560,0:00:12.260
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:12.260,0:00:15.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:15.660,0:00:18.260
Hallelujah.

0:00:18.260,0:00:23.020
I was trying to be jealous of you.

0:00:23.020,0:00:27.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:27.940,0:00:35.780
I was telling God, "Please, Baba God, release me!

0:00:35.780,0:00:40.900
I want to dance! I want to join them!"

0:00:40.900,0:00:43.720
Thank you.

0:00:43.720,0:00:50.840
Viewers all over the world, I want to thank you for your time.

0:00:50.840,0:00:54.940
God's time is the best.

0:00:54.940,0:01:01.460
If you do things at God's time, you will astonish yourself,

0:01:01.460,0:01:03.760
you will surprise yourself.

0:01:03.760,0:01:07.160
Just wait for God's time.

0:01:07.160,0:01:15.620
I remember that I left you on a message 'Talk on Faith'.

0:01:15.620,0:01:19.380
Talk on Faith.

0:01:19.380,0:01:21.260
That is it.

0:01:21.260,0:01:25.100
There is no substitute for faith.

0:01:25.100,0:01:27.900
There is no what?

0:01:27.900,0:01:31.600
There is no exchange for faith.

0:01:31.600,0:01:36.480
There is no substitute for faith.

0:01:36.480,0:01:44.220
Faith's value is unique - so unique.

0:01:44.220,0:01:47.120
Let's quickly talk about that.

0:01:47.120,0:01:48.720
Halleluyah.

0:01:48.720,0:01:52.800
Open the book of James 2.

0:01:52.800,0:01:56.900
Look at verse 18.

0:01:56.900,0:02:05.180
"But someone will say, 'You have faith; I have deeds'."

0:02:05.180,0:02:08.040
That is work.

0:02:08.040,0:02:11.740
"Show me your faith without deeds..."

0:02:11.740,0:02:18.920
It means, faith and your work, and the work of faith.

0:02:18.920,0:02:24.320
"...and I will show you my faith by my deeds."

0:02:24.320,0:02:26.660
By my actions.

0:02:26.660,0:02:29.660
"You believe that there is one God."

0:02:29.660,0:02:31.940
That is the statement there.

0:02:31.940,0:02:36.100
"You believe that there is one God. Good!"

0:02:36.100,0:02:38.460
There is a talk there.

0:02:38.460,0:02:48.240
"You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?"

0:02:48.240,0:02:51.640
That is evidence.

0:02:51.640,0:02:59.520
"Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did

0:02:59.520,0:03:06.600
when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?"

0:03:06.600,0:03:08.140
Verse 22.

0:03:08.140,0:03:14.320
"You see that his faith and his actions were working together,

0:03:14.320,0:03:21.200
and his faith was made complete by what he did."

0:03:21.200,0:03:24.080
That is father Abraham.

0:03:24.080,0:03:27.560
Talk on faith.

0:03:27.560,0:03:29.780
Halleluyah.

0:03:29.780,0:03:40.480
We are faced with God's uncompromising demands for faith.

0:03:40.480,0:03:43.100
You can see that there is an issue here.

0:03:43.100,0:03:55.820
We are faced with God's uncompromising demands for faith.

0:03:55.840,0:04:03.320
The righteous shall live by faith.

0:04:03.320,0:04:12.120
Whatever is not from faith is sin.

0:04:12.120,0:04:18.680
Without faith, it is impossible to please God.

0:04:18.680,0:04:25.580
This is why I call it, uncompromising demands for faith.

0:04:25.580,0:04:32.560
He who comes to God must believe and have faith.

0:04:32.560,0:04:35.920
There is no substitute.

0:04:35.920,0:04:39.540
They are Divine demands.

0:04:39.540,0:04:46.760
Its values are unique.

0:04:46.760,0:04:56.360
There is no substitute for faith - no alternative, no shortcuts.

0:04:56.360,0:05:00.760
This is why we are Christians.

0:05:00.760,0:05:13.420
The Bible says faith must be confessed with the mouth

0:05:13.420,0:05:30.240
but this faith confession must proceed from genuine faith in our hearts.

0:05:30.240,0:05:34.900
It must proceed from where?

0:05:34.900,0:05:38.320
From genuine faith in our hearts.

0:05:38.320,0:05:40.000
Why?

0:05:40.000,0:05:49.580
That shows that there all kinds of faith - faith in stones, faith in this, faith in that,

0:05:49.580,0:05:52.520
faith in faith, faith in yourself.

0:05:52.520,0:05:56.060
In the world, they use the word faith in business.

0:05:56.060,0:06:00.400
"I have faith in that business." - This is misusing the word.

0:06:00.400,0:06:03.920
Faith is a trust.

0:06:03.920,0:06:06.380
You can only trust God and love everyone.

0:06:06.380,0:06:12.320
You cannot trust human beings; they will leave you one day.

0:06:12.320,0:06:20.420
Faith is a trust but we use it as a misused word - all kinds of faith.

0:06:20.420,0:06:29.600
We are guilty of using empty words.

0:06:29.600,0:06:37.760
Today, we are guilty of using empty words. That is, an empty profession of faith.

0:06:37.760,0:06:42.380
You see people say, "Yes! In the name of Jesus!"

0:06:42.380,0:06:51.420
An empty profession of faith will not help us in any way.

0:06:51.420,0:06:54.480
It's like talking to the air.

0:06:54.480,0:07:04.120
"In Jesus name!" is going nowhere; it's in the air; it is an empty profession of faith.

0:07:04.120,0:07:13.540
Faith confession must be backed up by appropriate action.

0:07:13.540,0:07:19.060
That is faith without what?

0:07:19.060,0:07:29.340
I mean, faith without an appropriate action is dead.

0:07:29.340,0:07:38.160
Faith confession must be backed up by appropriate action.

0:07:38.160,0:07:40.600
What do I mean?

0:07:40.600,0:07:44.560
Let me just give you a picture of what I'm talking about.

0:07:44.560,0:08:03.280
If I say, I believe God will heal me and I'm at the same time worried and distressed,

0:08:03.280,0:08:08.700
my faith is questionable.

0:08:08.700,0:08:14.680
I say, I believe God will heal me. God will deliver me. God will bless me.

0:08:14.680,0:08:17.560
Like many of us are sitting down now.

0:08:17.560,0:08:21.840
After you finished dancing, you are now falling into your self-pity again.

0:08:21.840,0:08:25.280
But when you were dancing, you were happy.

0:08:25.280,0:08:30.120
After that now, you start thinking, "Ah, the thing is paining me again.

0:08:30.120,0:08:32.700
The thing is hitting me again".

0:08:32.700,0:08:36.180
Is it dancing that removed it?

0:08:36.180,0:08:37.520
No!

0:08:37.520,0:08:41.680
You believe God will heal you; you believe God will bless you and save you

0:08:41.680,0:08:49.300
and you are at the same time worried and distressed -

0:08:49.300,0:08:57.300
that nullifies your faith - question mark.

0:08:57.300,0:09:09.740
If you have faith in God, you should not just believe in Him.

0:09:09.740,0:09:18.360
If you have faith in God, you should not just believe in Him.

0:09:18.360,0:09:27.380
That is the idea today: Everybody believes in God, that is why you are here today.

0:09:27.380,0:09:29.680
Look at the picture.

0:09:29.680,0:09:38.200
Faith is like children to their father.

0:09:38.200,0:09:47.700
Not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord,

0:09:47.700,0:09:54.800
we should know Him like children know their father.

0:09:54.800,0:09:57.700
You know your father.

0:09:57.700,0:10:00.140
Good children; good father.

0:10:00.140,0:10:01.460
You say, "Daddy!"

0:10:01.460,0:10:04.880
You know the time to ask daddy what you want.

0:10:04.880,0:10:10.080
You know the time not to ask daddy, and you know the time to greet daddy.

0:10:10.080,0:10:16.680
Today, you don't know the time to ask God what you want; that is why you ask wrongly.

0:10:16.680,0:10:19.380
You don't know the time to come to God.

0:10:19.380,0:10:22.300
You don't know what God has in store for you.

0:10:22.300,0:10:28.000
The Bible says we must know God's will and pray according to His will.

0:10:28.000,0:10:31.160
But you don't know God's will; you only pray.

0:10:31.160,0:10:36.280
You don't know whether what you are asking is God's desire to give you.

0:10:36.280,0:10:39.560
You don't know.

0:10:39.560,0:10:46.880
You pray but you never know God's will concerning what you are asking for.

0:10:46.880,0:10:50.840
Whether it is the time to give you what you are asking for.

0:10:50.840,0:10:54.140
Whether that is exactly what He has in mind to give to you.

0:10:54.140,0:10:58.120
And whether it is the right time to give it to you. But you don't know, you just pray.

0:10:58.120,0:11:00.560
"In Jesus' name! In Jesus' name! Amen!"

0:11:00.560,0:11:07.760
That is why you always have disappointment - you pray, no answer.

0:11:07.760,0:11:12.620
You don't know when to pray, how to pray and what to ask for. You don't know.

0:11:12.620,0:11:20.420
Faith is like good children, loving children to their loving father.

0:11:20.420,0:11:22.580
That is faith.

0:11:22.580,0:11:34.060
The picture of belief is like a farmer saying, "I believe God is able to give me a harvest

0:11:34.060,0:11:49.340
without planting any seed".

0:11:49.340,0:11:56.100
"I believe God will give me, God is able to give me a harvest" - that is a farmer.

0:11:56.100,0:11:59.140
I am giving you a picture of belief without faith.

0:11:59.140,0:12:12.300
Many of us as believers today, we do not know how to believe, and express our faith. That is the problem.

0:12:12.300,0:12:17.020
We do not know how to believe and express our faith.

0:12:17.020,0:12:20.760
You don't know; that is believers today.

0:12:20.760,0:12:29.180
We believers, we do not know how to believe and express our faith.

0:12:29.180,0:12:37.880
Faith is expressed through work.

0:12:37.880,0:12:51.280
By work, faith is perfected.

0:12:51.280,0:13:08.480
If I say, "I believe it will not rain" and at the same time, I carry an umbrella along,

0:13:08.480,0:13:10.960
that is a question mark.

0:13:10.960,0:13:15.280
That has nullified your faith.

0:13:15.280,0:13:17.300
What does that mean?

0:13:17.300,0:13:22.820
It means you have not yet had faith.

0:13:22.820,0:13:39.600
Because when our hearts are uneasy and worried, this shows that we have not yet had faith.

0:13:39.600,0:13:44.800
That's when you are going and you say, "I believe it will not rain".

0:13:44.800,0:13:48.860
Now carrying an umbrella shows that you are worried.

0:13:48.860,0:13:52.020
There's a kind of worry in your heart.

0:13:52.020,0:13:55.060
That is why you have to carry an umbrella along.

0:13:55.060,0:13:59.160
I believe it will not rain. But now I'm going to carry an umbrella along.

0:13:59.160,0:14:04.300
That shows there is a kind of worry.

0:14:04.300,0:14:09.720
How should one have faith?

0:14:09.720,0:14:13.440
That is the question.

0:14:13.440,0:14:22.040
We have faith through the daily things around us.

0:14:22.040,0:14:26.720
I will not say through the happenings around us - I limited it.

0:14:26.720,0:14:31.720
I want to limit it this way - through the daily things around us.

0:14:31.720,0:14:38.920
My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes, they all belong to God.

0:14:38.920,0:14:47.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:47.160,0:14:49.320
You have just forgotten that.

0:14:49.320,0:14:52.160
Can you, on your seats, sing along with me?

0:14:52.160,0:15:15.700
My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes

0:15:15.700,0:15:22.580
They all belong to Jesus

0:15:22.580,0:15:30.520
Faith is manifested in the small things.

0:15:30.520,0:15:36.220
When you want to sit - "In the name of Jesus!"

0:15:36.220,0:15:39.900
It means you believe in God to sit.

0:15:39.900,0:15:42.760
You want to stand - "In Jesus' name!"

0:15:42.760,0:15:47.740
You believe in Jesus to stand, you believe you cannot stand without Jesus.

0:15:47.740,0:15:51.740
You must know how much you need God to have faith.

0:15:51.740,0:15:53.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:53.080,0:16:02.900
You must know how much you need God to have faith.

0:16:02.900,0:16:04.420
I can't hear you.

0:16:04.420,0:16:07.740
You must know how much you need God to have faith.

0:16:07.740,0:16:12.220
Today, we don't know how much we need God.

0:16:12.220,0:16:17.120
You don't know, you believe you can sit on your own.

0:16:17.120,0:16:21.740
There are many things you believe you can do on your own.

0:16:21.740,0:16:27.260
How many of you have called the name of Jesus before combing your hair?

0:16:27.260,0:16:31.460
Before you begin to dress up, how many of you say, "In Jesus' name!"?

0:16:31.460,0:16:35.840
When you are about to see, will you call the name Jesus to see?

0:16:35.840,0:16:39.700
You want to eat, will you call the name of Jesus to eat?

0:16:39.700,0:16:47.000
Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.

0:16:47.000,0:16:52.460
For you to have faith in God, that faith we are talking about,

0:16:52.460,0:16:58.260
you must know how much you need God.

0:16:58.260,0:17:02.680
That's why I take you to shoulder, head, toes.

0:17:02.680,0:17:07.840
Total dependence upon Him - you are not totally dependent on God

0:17:07.840,0:17:10.760
because there are many things you do on your own.

0:17:10.760,0:17:13.540
Those are things satan uses to hit you.

0:17:13.540,0:17:20.740
Each time satan wants to attack you, he goes through those things you do on your own.

0:17:20.740,0:17:23.400
You know you can sit on your own, you don't need to invite Jesus,

0:17:23.400,0:17:26.940
you don't need to bring Jesus to the scene before you sit.

0:17:26.940,0:17:31.240
Many people today that are just about to sit have strokes.

0:17:31.240,0:17:33.080
They collapse.

0:17:33.080,0:17:41.320
You need to know how much you need Jesus to have faith in Him -

0:17:41.320,0:17:44.800
in things both great and small.

0:17:44.800,0:18:13.020
Not mine not mine
The choice

0:18:13.020,0:18:42.780
In things both great and small

0:18:42.780,0:18:56.940
Be Thou my Guide my strength 
My wisdom my all

0:18:56.940,0:18:58.500
That's all.

0:18:58.500,0:19:06.400
This is where your problem comes from: You don't know how much you need God.

0:19:06.400,0:19:09.440
That's all.

0:19:09.440,0:19:12.460
You don't know how much you need God.

0:19:12.460,0:19:15.720
That is why you have a time for prayer.

0:19:15.720,0:19:20.560
All time is for prayer, not a time for prayer.

0:19:20.560,0:19:28.780
If you knew how much you needed God - total dependence on Him to smile, to drink,

0:19:28.780,0:19:33.660
to look, to turn your neck - you would pray 24/7.

0:19:33.660,0:19:38.260
To greet, you need God to do that.

0:19:38.260,0:19:41.140
That is why you cannot have faith.

0:19:41.140,0:19:47.340
Faith is not a part-time Christianity; it is full-time.

0:19:47.340,0:19:58.940
If we cannot commit our bodies to God when we are sick and troubled,

0:19:58.940,0:20:03.300
who will believe you have faith?

0:20:03.300,0:20:06.320
Who will believe? - Only the foolish.

If you cannot trust in God in your sicknesses, afflictions, situations and tribulations,

0:20:19.360,0:20:25.880
when will you trust him?

0:20:25.880,0:20:27.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:20:27.080,0:20:41.220
If you cannot trust in God in your trouble, tribulation, situation, temptation,

0:20:41.220,0:20:47.960

There are many troubles people carry to me.

0:20:57.840,0:21:03.180
You would see them after the prayer, they would carry their medication to see me,

0:21:03.180,0:21:08.020
"Man of God, this is my drug".

0:21:08.020,0:21:14.800
Some would meet me and say, "Will I still be using my medicine after the prayer?"

0:21:14.800,0:21:54.880
If you cannot trust in God with your medicine, you cannot trust in God without your medicine

0:21:54.880,0:22:00.640
because God Himself is the God of nature.

0:22:00.640,0:22:09.820
Those medicines are derived from nature - plants.

If a farmer can trust nature without a definite promise,

0:22:28.580,0:22:33.740
we Christians should trust the God of nature.

0:22:33.740,0:22:36.160
God is God of nature.

For an operation to be sucessful, God makes it successful.

0:22:43.220,0:22:49.820
For one to have a good treatment, God makes it thus.

0:22:49.820,0:23:01.600
He opens the way for a successful operation; He opens the way for a successful treatment.

0:23:01.600,0:23:04.200
We treat; God heals.

0:23:04.200,0:23:07.540
Doctors treat; God heals.

He opens the way for a successful operation,

0:23:22.760,0:23:28.220
for a successful treatment.

0:23:28.220,0:23:38.760
He opens doctors' eyes to give you appropriate treatment - the rightful treatment.

0:23:38.760,0:23:42.160
He opens their eyes.

0:23:42.160,0:23:47.880
If not, they'd not see anything, they'd not even know how to go about it.

0:23:47.880,0:23:58.860
Tablets and medicine are nature and God is God of nature.

0:23:58.860,0:24:11.700
If you cannot trust in God with your medicine, you cannot trust in Him without your medicine.

0:24:11.700,0:24:14.220
God bless you.
