0:00:00.000,0:00:01.860
Hallelujah!

0:00:01.860,0:00:03.220
Let someone say:

0:00:03.220,0:00:07.160
"Send your power on me!"

0:00:07.160,0:00:13.180
Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the presence  of Jesus".

0:00:13.180,0:00:18.300
Say, "Neighbour, Happy New Year in advance".

0:00:18.300,0:00:21.520
Say, "I am in His presence.

0:00:21.520,0:00:26.960
In His presence, there is fullness of love.

0:00:26.960,0:00:32.320
In His presence, fullness of power".

0:00:32.320,0:00:36.560
Let someone say, "Power - glory.

0:00:36.560,0:00:39.800
Glory - power!"

0:00:39.800,0:00:46.020
Give thanks to Jesus, give thanks to Him.

0:00:46.020,0:00:48.520
Thank You, Jesus!

0:00:48.520,0:00:51.520
Have your seat!

0:00:51.520,0:00:57.520
Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the presence of Jesus".

0:00:57.520,0:01:01.800
I don't know what you have been through this year.

0:01:01.800,0:01:06.240
But all I know is something new is about to happen.

0:01:06.240,0:01:09.620
Do you believe that?

0:01:09.620,0:01:12.240
It is something that can turn your life around.

0:01:12.240,0:01:15.000
Say, "Jesus loves me.

0:01:15.000,0:01:24.460
God loves me just as He loves any of His children".

0:01:24.460,0:01:29.580
Yes, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves you.

0:01:29.580,0:01:33.440
Never doubt the love of God in your life.

0:01:33.440,0:01:46.940
The Bible says that we have two loves - human love and God's love.

0:01:46.940,0:01:53.700
But human love is but a shadow of God's love.

0:01:53.700,0:02:03.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:03.100,0:02:05.100
Why?

0:02:05.100,0:02:12.980
Human love is conditional; God's love is unconditional.

0:02:12.980,0:02:18.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:18.920,0:02:26.660
Love cannot exist without relationship.

0:02:26.660,0:02:28.800
Why?

0:02:28.800,0:02:37.440
Because love can only be manifested where there is an object to be loved.

0:02:37.440,0:02:48.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:48.060,0:02:55.660
God wanted a love relationship so He created Adam.

0:02:55.660,0:03:01.960
When Adam sinned, that relationship was broken.

0:03:01.960,0:03:11.440
But the Bible says, God so loved the world that He planted His best seed, Jesus Christ,

0:03:11.440,0:03:21.880
to produce a family and today, millions are born again through this best seed.

0:03:21.880,0:03:47.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:47.340,0:03:56.060
This shows, this indicates that love is the golden thread that links God's creation.

0:03:56.060,0:04:10.400
Say, "Neighbour, love is the golden thread that links God's creation. Let love lead".

0:04:10.400,0:04:15.100
It brings us to our message this morning: AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP

0:04:15.100,0:04:18.480
Tell your neighbour, "AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP".

0:04:18.480,0:04:20.680
Let me take you to the Book of Matthew.

0:04:20.680,0:04:29.140
Jesus says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy'.

0:04:29.140,0:04:39.720
But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you,

0:04:39.720,0:04:45.720
and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,

0:04:45.720,0:04:49.440
that you may be sons of your Father in Heaven;

0:04:49.440,0:04:54.220
for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good,

0:04:54.220,0:05:01.360
and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

0:05:01.360,0:05:09.600
Therefore, you shall be perfect, just as your Father in Heaven is perfect."

0:05:09.600,0:05:14.580
Let someone say, "AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP".

0:05:14.580,0:05:22.040
We are here for an extraordinary relationship.

0:05:22.040,0:05:28.800
An extraordinary relationship does not begin with a love for people.

0:05:28.800,0:05:37.240
It begins with a love for God and that love overflows to people.

0:05:37.240,0:05:46.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:46.080,0:05:50.960
God's love is first love. Through His love, we love.

0:05:50.960,0:05:55.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:55.420,0:06:00.820
Let someone say, "There is no love without relationship".

0:06:00.820,0:06:09.560
Relationship means cooperation - where the people involved in that relationship

0:06:09.560,0:06:14.220
benefit or gain from each other.

0:06:14.220,0:06:18.440
We are one another's strength.

0:06:18.440,0:06:31.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:31.580,0:06:38.520
A harmonious relationship - be it in your business, be it in your marriage -

0:06:38.520,0:06:46.440
a harmonious relationship is all about beneficial cooperation.

0:06:46.440,0:06:54.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:54.380,0:07:02.840
Beneficial cooperation means a symbiotic, a reciprocal relationship

0:07:02.840,0:07:08.320
based on the principle of mutual giving and receiving.

0:07:08.320,0:07:13.560
This is the relationship approved by God.

0:07:13.560,0:07:27.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:27.220,0:07:31.920
How can we achieve this today?

0:07:31.920,0:07:38.600
The man of God said that we must set aside our differences

0:07:38.600,0:07:45.880
to bring about cooperation and relationship among us.

0:07:45.880,0:07:58.240
We must set aside our differences to bring about what the other person lacks.

0:07:58.240,0:08:10.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:10.100,0:08:16.740
Tell your neighbour, "I am because you are, you are because I am".

0:08:16.740,0:08:25.600
Say, "Neighbour, there is no such thing as a perfect relationship".

0:08:25.600,0:08:37.060
There is no perfect relationship because perfection eludes us all; we all hurt somewhere.

0:08:37.060,0:08:47.140
That is why today, many relationships are under repair because we lack love.

0:08:47.140,0:08:54.960
Today, as we are sitting, many relationships are under repair because we lack love.

0:08:54.960,0:09:03.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:03.840,0:09:07.780
There is no relationship without challenges.

0:09:07.780,0:09:14.080
God never promised that there would be no more trouble but He promised to see you through.

0:09:14.080,0:09:21.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:21.400,0:09:29.260
For a relationship to come to stay, for a relationship to be stable,

0:09:29.260,0:09:32.700
it must go through thick and thin.

0:09:32.700,0:09:42.040
I mean, it must go through many experiences - both positive and negative.

0:09:42.040,0:09:51.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:51.060,0:09:57.460
Because personnel improvement and fulfillment comes from the continual process

0:09:57.460,0:10:04.280
of learning from both positive and negative experiences.

0:10:04.280,0:10:18.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:18.320,0:10:21.640
When challenges come, don't break.

0:10:21.640,0:10:28.860
Challenges force us to look inward and to discover

0:10:28.860,0:10:34.500
and to come up with the result that nobody knows you as you know yourself.

0:10:34.500,0:10:38.960
Look at every successful relationship you see today -

0:10:38.960,0:10:41.380
be it in their business, be it in their marriage -

0:10:41.380,0:10:47.420
you will see how much pain, how much trouble they underwent

0:10:47.420,0:10:51.580
before they came to a successful relationship.

0:10:51.580,0:11:12.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:12.500,0:11:19.140
Let someone say, "Challenges strengthen our relationship".

0:11:19.140,0:11:28.240
Say, "Neighbour, don't give up. Challenges strengthen our relationship".

0:11:28.240,0:11:31.480
That why we need to know this.

0:11:31.480,0:11:36.820
Don't break any relationship because of challenges.

0:11:36.820,0:11:46.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:46.620,0:11:53.460
Say, "Neighbour, I am ready for an extraordinary relationship this morning.

0:11:53.460,0:12:03.260
I am ready for a new dawn in my relationship, in my marriage, in my life".

0:12:03.260,0:12:09.280
Say, "Neighbour, don't reject anyone because of today.

0:12:09.280,0:12:13.100
Don't reject him because of today.

0:12:13.100,0:12:16.480
Don't reject her because of today.

0:12:16.480,0:12:21.520
Don't reject them because of today".

0:12:21.520,0:12:24.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:24.360,0:12:26.440
Why?

0:12:26.440,0:12:34.500
Today, we lose friends because of differences.

0:12:34.500,0:12:41.440
Relationships break beyond repair because of life's challenges.

0:12:41.440,0:12:54.060
Don't allow weakness and confrontation to tear your relationship down or to pull you apart.

0:12:54.060,0:13:03.760
Rather, see that challenge as a means to come closer to God, to come closer together,

0:13:03.760,0:13:11.500
to be prepared for victory because victory is yours, in the name of Jesus!

0:13:11.500,0:13:22.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:22.860,0:13:31.560
Relationships break today because of differences and the uniqueness of the participants.

0:13:31.560,0:13:41.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:41.060,0:13:49.760
Relationships break because of unacknowledged and unrecognized differences

0:13:49.760,0:13:54.080
in the people involved in that relationship.

0:13:54.080,0:14:03.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:03.540,0:14:10.020
Say, "Neighbour, our differences make us unique.

0:14:10.020,0:14:15.360
Your difference makes you unique".

0:14:15.360,0:14:25.440
It makes you unique; it is a feature that must be recognized on each person.

0:14:25.440,0:14:33.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:33.980,0:14:45.240
We must accept the differences in our personalities and the natural gift we are endowed with.

0:14:45.240,0:14:47.960
This is what we call beneficial cooperation.

0:14:47.960,0:14:54.400
Say, "I am because you are, you are because I am".

0:14:54.400,0:14:59.540
This feature must be recognized so that relationship can stand,

0:14:59.540,0:15:03.280
that relationship can be permanent, can endure.

0:15:03.280,0:15:15.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:15.560,0:15:24.000
Say, "Neighbour, don't reject anyone because of today.

0:15:24.000,0:15:32.940
Where you are strong, I am weak; where I am weak, you are strong.

0:15:32.940,0:15:39.180
We are one another's strength".

0:15:39.180,0:15:48.960
If you reject anyone because of his weakness, you reject his strength.

0:15:48.960,0:16:01.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:01.240,0:16:11.480
If you know the weakness of your friend, help him, instead of criticizing or rejecting him.

0:16:11.480,0:16:19.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:19.160,0:16:24.720
We must recognize this in order to have the victory.

0:16:24.720,0:16:34.040
Say, "Neighbour, a New Year is coming".

0:16:34.040,0:16:38.460
What is the way out?

0:16:38.460,0:16:44.100
There is no better way to celebrate the incoming year

0:16:44.100,0:16:51.420
than to reprogramme ourselves for an extraordinary relationship.

0:16:51.420,0:16:59.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:59.160,0:17:04.320
Are you ready for that?

0:17:04.320,0:17:15.220
An ordinary relationship can become an extraordinary relationship by looking up to Jesus.

0:17:15.220,0:17:21.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:21.280,0:17:24.040
Say, "Neighbour, look up to Jesus".

0:17:24.040,0:17:31.040
No matter what you are passing through now - be it in your marriage, be it in your business -

0:17:31.040,0:17:36.880
look up to Jesus; He is the Restorer and the Repairer.

0:17:36.880,0:17:40.760
An ordinary relationship can become extraordinary by looking up to Jesus.

0:17:40.760,0:17:49.340
Remember, Jesus forgave those who mocked Him and even killed Him.

0:17:49.340,0:17:58.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:58.140,0:18:07.780
Say, "Neighbour, are you ready to build that new relationship? Are you ready?"

0:18:07.780,0:18:14.760
The Bible says in the Book of Galatians 6:1 that there is a way out.

0:18:14.760,0:18:23.740
First and foremost, we must learn the guiding principle to maintain a successful relationship.

0:18:23.740,0:18:37.400
Say, "Neighbour, don't reject anyone on account of today because tomorrow is mystery".

0:18:37.400,0:18:43.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:43.640,0:18:48.760
Mystery means unknowable, secret, hidden.

0:18:48.760,0:18:55.160
Mystery means divine truth, divine revelation.

0:18:55.160,0:19:05.720
Say, "Neighbour, don't break relationships beyond repair because of today

0:19:05.720,0:19:16.280
because the person who is a thorn in your flesh today can be your saviour tomorrow.

0:19:16.280,0:19:27.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:27.660,0:19:34.500
Say, "Neighbour, don't break any relationship beyond repair because of today

0:19:34.500,0:19:40.580
because the person who is a thorn to your flesh today can be your saviour tomorrow.

0:19:40.580,0:19:47.660
A broken person can be arranged for a seat of power

0:19:47.660,0:19:55.720
A broken person can be prepared for the throne, can be a leader tomorrow.

0:19:55.720,0:20:01.920
The person who is bad today can be the best tomorrow.

0:20:01.920,0:20:20.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:20.760,0:20:33.160
Say, "Neighbour, an extraordinary relationship does not just happen, it is built".

0:20:33.160,0:20:39.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:39.760,0:20:47.540
Building that extraordinary relationship requires a new approach because a new year is coming.

0:20:47.540,0:20:54.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:54.380,0:21:02.220
My brothers, as we said: There is no better way to celebrate this incoming year

0:21:02.220,0:21:06.680
than to programme yourself for an extraordinary relationship.

0:21:06.680,0:21:19.840
The Bible says in Galatians 6:1, there must be forgiveness because no relationship is perfect.

0:21:19.840,0:21:27.120
There must be forgiveness because no one is perfect on this earth.

0:21:27.120,0:21:35.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:35.780,0:21:47.020
Forgiveness offers us today the opportunity to reshape our relationship for the best which is yet to come.

0:21:47.020,0:21:55.500
Say, "Neighbour, forgiveness today offers me the opportunity

0:21:55.500,0:22:04.180
to reshape my relationship for the best which is yet to come.

0:22:04.180,0:22:11.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:11.080,0:22:22.140
Misunderstanding in relationship leads to greater understanding when Jesus is involved.

0:22:22.140,0:22:29.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:29.640,0:22:35.580
Let someone say, "Forgiveness strikes the root of all pain.

0:22:35.580,0:22:46.480
Forgiveness paves the way for a harmonious relationship even with your enemy".

0:22:46.480,0:22:58.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:58.440,0:23:07.460
Jesus said that when you love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you,

0:23:07.460,0:23:19.460
this releases you from the destructive emotions of anger, bitterness and revenge against others.

0:23:19.460,0:23:33.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:33.180,0:23:41.360
Say, "Neighbour, the person most hurt by unforgiveness is you".

0:23:41.360,0:23:52.120
Say to yourself, "The person most hurt by unforgiveness is me".

0:23:52.120,0:23:58.240
When we fail to forgive, we find ourselves in a torture chamber.

0:23:58.240,0:24:04.740
We find ourselves wallowing in our own sins.

0:24:04.740,0:24:18.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:18.800,0:24:33.160
The harbouring of a spirit of unforgiveness breaks the communion with God.

0:24:33.160,0:24:38.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:38.680,0:24:50.100
Therefore, we should not come to a confrontation about sin with the intent of punishing the sin

0:24:50.100,0:24:56.120
or with the intent of harming the other person.

0:24:56.120,0:25:05.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:05.560,0:25:15.020
If we do not come to a settling account in this matter we find ourselves in grave danger.

0:25:15.020,0:25:21.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:21.540,0:25:28.300
Say, "Neighbour, are you ready for a new level in your relationship?

0:25:28.300,0:25:38.320
Are you ready to reshape your relationship in your business, home, marriage, life?

0:25:38.320,0:25:40.020
Are you ready?"

0:25:40.020,0:25:44.080
Say, "Don't give up.

0:25:44.080,0:25:50.920
Stay put; a new year is coming".

0:25:50.920,0:25:56.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:56.240,0:26:06.700
We should not enter the New Year with a heart full of offence, full of pain of the past.

0:26:06.700,0:26:12.680
If you enter the New year holding onto offence,

0:26:12.680,0:26:18.900
you are still living in the past and there is nothing new in the incoming year.

0:26:18.900,0:26:32.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:32.520,0:26:41.080
Say, "Neighbour, we make the year new by the way we live it".

0:26:41.080,0:26:45.800
You make the year new by the way you live it.

0:26:45.800,0:26:50.820
You renew the covenant by the way you live it.

0:26:50.820,0:26:53.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:53.460,0:26:54.620
How do we live it?

0:26:54.620,0:26:58.920
Say, "Neighbour, how do you make the year new?"

0:26:58.920,0:27:02.760
Say, "Give them another chance".

0:27:02.760,0:27:07.040
Give them another chance.

0:27:07.040,0:27:14.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:14.000,0:27:20.920
Now, I want you to look at your neighbour and to ask him this question.

0:27:20.920,0:27:26.680
Say, "Neighbour, do you find it difficult to forgive?"

0:27:26.680,0:27:27.980
Ask him.

0:27:27.980,0:27:36.760
Say, "Neighbour, do you find it difficult to forgive?"

0:27:36.760,0:27:47.300
If you find it difficult to forgive, then take a look back at your own life and answer this question.

0:27:47.300,0:27:52.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:52.700,0:27:54.860
Are you ready to ask the question?

0:27:54.860,0:28:02.580
Say, "Neighbour, are you ready? Let me ask you a question".

0:28:02.580,0:28:10.580
Say, "What has the Heavenly Father forgiven in your life?"

0:28:10.580,0:28:13.940
Think about it and tell your neighbour again.

0:28:13.940,0:28:28.940
What has the Heavenly Father forgiven in your life? Think about it.

0:28:28.940,0:28:50.780
Say, "Neighbour, how patient the Heavenly Father is with you - forgiving you day in, day out".

0:28:50.780,0:29:00.520
Say, "Neighbour, how merciful the Heavenly Father is with you".

0:29:00.520,0:29:08.460
When you ignore Him, when you disappoint Him, when you break His commandments,

0:29:08.460,0:29:13.800
His love upon you remains constant.

0:29:13.800,0:29:18.840
Do you find it difficult to forgive?

0:29:18.840,0:29:50.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:50.240,0:29:55.140
So brothers, this is the answer.

0:29:55.140,0:30:00.760
This is the key to make all things new.

0:30:00.760,0:30:11.040
Loving your enemy, forgiving those who sin against you will always seem unreasonable,

0:30:11.040,0:30:18.600
until you realise that we were enemies to God and He forgave us.

0:30:18.600,0:30:24.320
So loving your enemies, forgiving them will seem unrealistic

0:30:24.320,0:30:32.280
until we come to realise that we were enemies to God and He forgave us.

0:30:32.280,0:30:44.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:44.600,0:30:48.980
Say, "Neighbour, if you are forgiven..."

0:30:48.980,0:30:51.500
Are you sure, you are forgiven?

0:30:51.500,0:30:54.740
I'm asking you, what is the state of your heart?

0:30:54.740,0:31:08.200
Say, "Neighbour, if you are forgiven, that forgiveness will produce in you a forgiving spirit towards others".

0:31:08.200,0:31:17.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:17.240,0:31:19.980
Therefore, let love lead.

0:31:19.980,0:31:23.980
Can we stand up in His presence.

0:31:23.980,0:31:31.000
Say, "Let love lead.

0:31:31.000,0:31:35.900
In your marriage - let love lead.

0:31:35.900,0:31:40.200
In your business - let love lead.

0:31:40.200,0:31:46.420
In your relationship - let love lead".

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:53.560,0:31:59.800
When you follow the light of love in this coming year,

0:31:59.800,0:32:06.000
nothing out of God's control can happen to you.

0:32:06.000,0:32:15.060
Say, "Neighbour, when you follow the light of love in this coming year,

0:32:15.060,0:32:24.400
no matter how thick the darkness, nothing out of God's control will happen to you.

0:32:24.400,0:32:31.260
Nothing out of God's control will happen to your marriage, to your life.

0:32:31.260,0:32:32.940
That is the promise of God.

0:32:32.940,0:32:35.660
God bless His Word, in Jesus' name.
