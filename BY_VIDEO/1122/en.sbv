God Almighty uses Prophet T.B. Joshua as a channel of light

0:00:04.180,0:00:08.440
to dispel every shade of darkness in the lives of the people

0:00:08.440,0:00:12.500
As he leads the congregation in mass prayer, he reveals the root cause

0:00:12.500,0:00:16.980
of the problems in the lives of the people through words of prophecy.

0:00:16.980,0:00:22.280
There is a woman. You just left your marriage and your husband is begging you to come back

0:00:22.280,0:00:25.000
but you are in-between decision.

0:00:25.000,0:00:26.700
You are in-between decision.

0:00:26.700,0:00:30.940
You left your marriage and your husband is begging you to come back.

0:00:30.940,0:00:34.360
You are in-between decision - whether to go or not. Please come.

0:00:34.360,0:00:37.060
Jesus loves you. Come.

0:00:37.060,0:00:40.900
Sir, I am the one you called who left her husband.

0:00:40.900,0:00:45.760
I left my husband and I am trying to decide. Right now, I have not decided to go back.

0:00:45.760,0:00:48.920
He was the one who told me to come to church.

0:00:48.920,0:00:53.920
You say you are contemplating going back to your husband

0:00:53.920,0:00:57.340
because each time you see yourself in the mirror, you are happy.

0:00:57.340,0:01:00.180
You have to go back. Okay?

0:01:00.180,0:01:04.920
What you have done to your husband is more than what your husband has done to you.

0:01:04.920,0:01:05.880
Okay?

0:01:05.880,0:01:08.020
So, I will talk to you.

0:01:08.020,0:01:10.480
You can't trade anything with that, okay?

0:01:10.480,0:01:11.120
Yes, sir.

0:01:11.120,0:01:13.600
You know in your home, they don't have settled homes.

0:01:13.600,0:01:14.340
Yes, sir.

0:01:14.340,0:01:16.900
Okay. You don't have settled homes.

0:01:16.900,0:01:17.780
It is true, sir.

0:01:17.780,0:01:19.560
For you to have...

0:01:19.560,0:01:22.060
The beginning of your life was disappointment.

0:01:22.060,0:01:22.960
Yes, sir. It is true, sir.

0:01:22.960,0:01:26.380
You know you started your life with disappointment.

0:01:26.380,0:01:30.740
Your first attempt failed before you met this man.

0:01:30.740,0:01:32.040
Yes, sir. It is true, sir.

0:01:32.040,0:01:36.740
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:36.740,0:01:41.600
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:41.600,0:01:45.500
My name is Mrs Gloria Albert Egbelo.

0:01:45.500,0:01:51.560
The man standing beside me is my husband Albert Egbelo.

0:01:51.560,0:01:57.840
Last week Sunday, I sat at the back when the man of God was prophecying.

0:01:57.840,0:02:03.400
He said that there was a lady down there who just left her husband.

0:02:03.400,0:02:05.780
The husband had been begging her to come back.

0:02:05.780,0:02:10.880
She was still contemplating whether to come back or not.

0:02:10.880,0:02:13.020
That was when I now came out.

0:02:13.020,0:02:15.560
Can you tell us your life experiences in your marriage

0:02:15.560,0:02:18.120
that brought about that decision you took to pack out of the house.

0:02:18.120,0:02:26.880
Before I left my husband's house, my husband was busy drinking, womanising.

0:02:26.880,0:02:32.720
He was not even paying attention to the house because of the women that he kept.

0:02:32.720,0:02:38.480
He had other women outside so he wasn't paying attention at all.

0:02:38.480,0:02:41.940
Sometimes, he would go and drink and come back very drunk,

0:02:41.940,0:02:45.500
be vomiting everwhere so I was tired.

0:02:45.500,0:02:49.100
At a point, the parents said that the fault was from me.

0:02:49.100,0:02:54.320
So that was why I left the house. I packed my things, carried my baby and left

0:02:54.320,0:02:57.480
when my husband starting displaying such behaviours.

0:02:57.480,0:03:02.140
I now lost affection - sometimes, I used to tell him, "I hate you!"

0:03:02.140,0:03:04.260
I don't know affection at all.

0:03:04.260,0:03:05.980
He doesn't even sleep with me.

0:03:05.980,0:03:08.780
Anytime he comes close to me, it irritates me.

0:03:08.780,0:03:15.360
Even when he uses a spoon to eat, I wash the spoon before I eat with the spoon.

0:03:15.360,0:03:19.520
Now tell us what happened when you finally came to The SCOAN.

0:03:19.520,0:03:22.640
On one Sunday, I came to the church.

0:03:22.640,0:03:27.100
The man of God was then prophecying that there was a lady in the church

0:03:27.100,0:03:32.920
that just left her husband and she was in-between deciding whether to come back or not.

0:03:32.920,0:03:36.520
That prophecy was very very true.

0:03:36.520,0:03:40.220
Because even when I came to the church, I was even saying,

0:03:40.220,0:03:43.780
"When I go back, I will not go back to him again".

0:03:43.780,0:03:49.360
So before the man of God prophecied and said that there was a lady in the church

0:03:49.360,0:03:54.900
that left her husband and she was still contemplating on whether to go back or not.

0:03:54.900,0:03:59.340
It is true because I was contemplating, I was so tired. I said, "I'm not going back!"

0:03:59.340,0:04:02.740
I said to myself, "Should I go back to this man and continue with this suffering?

0:04:02.740,0:04:05.300
No! I will not go back!"

0:04:05.300,0:04:10.040
Now, after the prophecy, tell us what happened that brought about the testimony today.

0:04:10.060,0:04:15.260
After the prophecy, the man of God prayed for me.

0:04:15.260,0:04:18.460
He then invited my husband and prayed for us.

0:04:18.460,0:04:21.520
After the prayers, everything just disappeared.

0:04:21.520,0:04:26.280
Even my husband has changed. He has turned into a lovely man.

0:04:26.280,0:04:29.840
That is not enough for Jesus Christ! Put your hands together beautifully

0:04:29.840,0:04:31.960
for the miracle-working God!

0:04:31.960,0:04:34.360
Now, people really want to understand the difference.

0:04:34.360,0:04:38.280
You said, before now, it got to a stage where the hatred was so terrible

0:04:38.280,0:04:41.940
to the extent that after your husband finished using a spoon to eat,

0:04:41.940,0:04:45.820
you had to wash the spoon - sterilise it very well before you used it

0:04:45.820,0:04:48.980
to really explain the extent of that hatred, that the affection was no longer there.

0:04:48.980,0:04:50.820
Tell us the changes you are seeing right now

0:04:50.820,0:04:54.180
to confirm that the Lord has delivered you and your husband.

0:04:54.180,0:04:59.600
Since after the deliverance, in fact, if my husband is not by my side for a second,

0:04:59.600,0:05:02.380
I would start calling him, "Where are you? Come back now!"

0:05:02.380,0:05:05.980
My husband doesn't drink; he doesn't do all those things.

0:05:05.980,0:05:10.560
He comes back early. Even when a woman is passing, he wouldn't react.

0:05:10.560,0:05:13.520
Everything has now changed. Even my behaviour towards him has changed.

0:05:13.520,0:05:15.660
I love him so much.

0:05:15.660,0:05:20.280
Okay. Before now, each time he was moving with you, he would be looking somewhere else?

0:05:20.280,0:05:24.520
Before now, I didn't even move with him because any time he said, "Let's go out,

0:05:24.520,0:05:29.620
I would say, "You go! I will come and meet you" because I didn't even want people seeing us around.

0:05:29.620,0:05:31.200
But right now, after the deliverance?

0:05:31.200,0:05:33.640
Now, he is my...

0:05:33.640,0:05:38.520
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:05:38.520,0:05:40.740
To God be the glory! Only Jesus can do this.

0:05:40.740,0:05:45.780
We thank God Almighty. You can imagine a wonderful marriage that is at the verge of divorce.

0:05:45.780,0:05:48.120
At the end of the day, the Lord delivered them

0:05:48.120,0:05:50.900
and right now, they are reconciled back to the glory of God.

0:05:50.900,0:05:54.960
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:05:54.960,0:05:59.580
Now, before we listen to words of advice from you, let's quickly hear from your husband.

0:05:59.580,0:06:04.320
My name is Albert Egbelo.

0:06:04.320,0:06:10.000
I'm a deputy superintendent of police. I am a unit commander.

0:06:10.000,0:06:13.120
The woman next to me is my dear wife.

0:06:13.120,0:06:17.100
What she said rightly - all was right.

0:06:17.100,0:06:20.860
I was busy drinking and womanising before.

0:06:20.860,0:06:28.940
Lsst week Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied about her and she was picked out.

0:06:28.940,0:06:35.540
After the deliverance and prayers from Prophet T.B. Joshua for my wife and myself,

0:06:35.540,0:06:39.840
all the things I used to do - the drinking, following women,

0:06:39.840,0:06:45.400
coming back home late - stopped because he prayed for me.

0:06:45.400,0:06:50.280
I bless God and thank God for my life and my family.

0:06:50.280,0:06:54.000
Okay. Let us now know about the difference between you and your wife.

0:06:54.000,0:06:55.840
She said that before now, she didn't want to see you at all.

0:06:55.840,0:07:00.400
What are the changes you have seen as a man?

0:07:00.400,0:07:02.640
She is wonderful now.

0:07:02.640,0:07:10.220
My attention, my mind, everything, the drinking, everything she did not want

0:07:10.220,0:07:12.760
has stopped after the deliverance.

0:07:12.760,0:07:16.880
Right now, I see her as my angel and everything to me.

0:07:16.880,0:07:21.380
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:07:21.380,0:07:24.340
And the area of womanising - what can you say about it?

0:07:24.340,0:07:30.940
Well, for those who do not know, there is nothing to gain there because I've been there.

0:07:30.940,0:07:36.760
The area of womanising - God has touched me

0:07:36.760,0:07:41.060
and there is not any other woman that is far better than my wife.

0:07:41.060,0:07:41.800
Thank you.

0:07:41.800,0:07:45.360
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:07:45.360,0:07:48.620
We thank God Almight for what He has done in your life and also in the life of your wife.

0:07:48.620,0:07:52.400
As a man - many men are listening to you; they want to hear a word of advice from you.

0:07:52.400,0:07:55.600
What's your advice to men and to everyone?

0:07:55.600,0:07:58.320
My advice - I'm a man.

0:07:58.320,0:08:05.760
My advice to all men over the world, particularly the ones seated here is:

0:08:05.760,0:08:09.460
They should pay attention to their wifes at home,

0:08:09.460,0:08:14.500
pay attention to God, be particularly always prayerful. Thank you.

0:08:14.500,0:08:18.040
Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:08:18.040,0:08:22.080
Finally, let us also hear a piece of advice from your wife.

0:08:22.080,0:08:25.880
Can you advise women and everyone.

0:08:25.880,0:08:29.420
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:29.420,0:08:34.880
My advice to all women is: When you have a problem or challenges,

0:08:34.880,0:08:39.060
although your challenge is telling you to run to God and not go out,

0:08:39.060,0:08:42.260
because of those challenges I had to run away

0:08:42.260,0:08:45.660
but the challenges were then telling me, "Please, when you are having challenges,

0:08:45.660,0:08:49.140
any time you are having challenges with your husband, know that it is not him

0:08:49.140,0:08:53.420
but the spirit is disturbing him. Please, run to God, pray for him.

0:08:53.420,0:08:55.440
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:55.440,0:08:56.600
God is with us!

0:08:56.600,0:09:00.400
Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:09:00.400,0:09:02.620
Yes, that is indeed a wonderful advice.

0:09:02.620,0:09:05.940
She said it loud and clear that if she did not run to God,

0:09:05.940,0:09:08.040
today, the story would have changed.

0:09:08.040,0:09:12.900
We thank God Almighty that the Lord Almighty who she ran to has restored her marriage happily.

0:09:12.900,0:09:14.460
We thank God Almighty for her life.

0:09:14.460,0:09:16.100
We really rejoice with you greatly.

0:09:16.100,0:09:19.800
We also want to advise you to make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:09:19.800,0:09:22.000
As you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,

0:09:22.000,0:09:25.100
always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough,

0:09:25.100,0:09:26.880
the best is always yet to come.

0:09:26.880,0:09:31.120
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
