0:00:00.140,0:00:04.180
You know you have the spirit of witchcraft.

0:00:04.180,0:00:06.480
Yes.

0:00:06.480,0:00:10.200
You always threaten this man with 
divorce; you want to leave the house.

0:00:10.260,0:00:13.340
Yes, it always comes into my mind.

0:00:13.340,0:00:15.940
I have thoughts that I have to commit suicide, that I have to leave him,

0:00:15.940,0:00:18.520
and that I have to make him nothing.

0:00:18.520,0:00:27.700
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:27.780,0:00:29.980
Holy Ghost!

0:00:29.980,0:00:32.200
I want to destroy her.

0:00:32.240,0:00:36.040
I want to destroy her and
I want to put his name on it.

0:00:36.040,0:00:38.600
You want to do what?

0:00:38.600,0:00:39.740
I want to make him nothing.

0:00:39.740,0:00:41.380
- You want to make him nothing?
- Yes!

0:00:41.380,0:00:42.320
Why?

0:00:42.320,0:00:43.940
Holy Ghost!

0:00:43.940,0:00:45.400
Talk!

0:00:45.400,0:00:48.540
In the name of Jesus, why do 
you want to make him nothing?

0:00:48.540,0:00:52.540
He says: "Myself and my family will work for God."

0:00:52.540,0:00:54.120
Okay.

0:00:54.120,0:00:59.020
Holy Ghost, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:59.020,0:01:00.760
You say what?

0:01:00.760,0:01:02.240
To destroy him.

0:01:02.240,0:01:03.880
- You want to destroy him?
- Yes.

0:01:03.880,0:01:05.000
Why?

0:01:05.000,0:01:07.040
Because he wants to serve God.

0:01:07.040,0:01:09.420
- Because he wants to serve God?
- Yes.

0:01:09.420,0:01:14.600
- Because you hate him to serve God?
- Yes.

0:01:14.600,0:01:16.540
Watch your screen.

0:01:16.540,0:01:23.740
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:23.740,0:01:27.420
The evil spirits in a woman speaking - that this is the wife of this man.

0:01:27.420,0:01:30.300
The evil spirit says it wants to destroy the husband.

0:01:30.300,0:01:39.180
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:39.180,0:01:44.140
If she is delivered and this man is not
 delivered, we have not done anything

0:01:44.140,0:01:47.100
because she has deposited something in him.

0:01:47.100,0:01:49.980
So she is delivered and he is delivered.

0:01:49.980,0:01:54.480
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:01:54.480,0:01:56.320
You can serve your God.

0:01:56.320,0:01:59.160
- I want to serve my God.
- You can serve GOD!

0:01:59.160,0:02:02.160
Yes! Hallelujah!

0:02:02.160,0:02:07.160
That is my only ambition: to serve my God to the last moment of my life.

0:02:07.160,0:02:08.580
Hallelujah.

0:02:08.580,0:02:11.220
Now you are free!

0:02:11.220,0:02:13.800
Go and give your husband a hug.

0:02:13.800,0:02:19.500
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:02:19.500,0:02:21.880
Watch your screen.

0:02:21.880,0:02:27.100
Total deliverance for the husband and wife.

0:02:27.100,0:02:34.960
"What the Lord has joined" together...

0:02:34.960,0:02:37.760
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:37.760,0:02:42.000
Thank You for setting us free and delivering us, Lord!

0:02:42.000,0:02:45.700
We want to serve You, Lord!

0:02:45.700,0:02:50.760
Where there is solution, 
there is forgiveness.

0:02:50.760,0:02:54.740
Where there is no solution,
 there is no forgiveness.

0:02:54.740,0:02:56.960
This is solution.

0:02:56.960,0:03:00.380
Now, she is a wonderful woman.

0:03:00.380,0:03:10.140
It is the antecedent; it is biological make-up.

0:03:10.140,0:03:16.580
So now she is free, never in your life remind her again -

0:03:16.580,0:03:18.860
no matter what happens in the house.

0:03:18.860,0:03:24.100
If you people disagree,
 that is the area you should not mention.

0:03:24.100,0:03:26.420
If you mention that, you offend God.

0:03:26.420,0:03:27.560
Thank you.

0:03:27.560,0:03:33.600
Thank you, Man of God!
 Thank You, Jesus!

0:03:33.600,0:03:37.440
She is going to join you in the ministry.

0:03:37.440,0:03:39.720
Yes, she is going to join you.
Wonderful!

0:03:39.720,0:03:48.440
She is an evangelist.
She is going to join you in the ministry.

0:03:48.440,0:03:58.580
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:03:58.580,0:04:05.960
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:05.960,0:04:09.500
Yes, indeed God is with us.

0:04:09.500,0:04:11.980
My name is Mrs Rina Matthew.

0:04:11.980,0:04:15.660
Next to me is my beloved husband
Matthew Varughese.

0:04:15.660,0:04:20.220
Next to him is our beloved
daughter Marylin Matthew.

0:04:20.220,0:04:24.740
We are originally from India 
but we are living in New Zealand.

0:04:24.740,0:04:32.200
The problem that brought us to
The SCOAN, Nigeria, was a marital problem.

0:04:32.200,0:04:38.080
Ever since I got married to my husband,
 there was neither peace nor happiness.

0:04:38.080,0:04:43.260
There was always fighting;
there was a spirit of anger and hatred in me.

0:04:43.260,0:04:47.940
We never met together as
 husband and wife in peace.

0:04:47.940,0:04:52.020
It was just a forceful sleep on
the same bed.

0:04:52.020,0:04:56.240
I was very angry and I was
having hatred within me.

0:04:56.240,0:05:03.020
But when the spirit was away from me, I used to pity myself and be very guilty about what I was doing.

0:05:03.020,0:05:05.680
But the moment the spirit came back to me,

0:05:05.680,0:05:09.300
I would be so rebellious and arrogant towards him.

0:05:09.300,0:05:15.860
When the spirit was in me, it was 
like a hundred-men power within me.

0:05:15.860,0:05:19.220
I could not be controlled by anyone.

0:05:19.220,0:05:26.200
I used to smash utensils, break things, bang the doors and tear clothes.

0:05:26.200,0:05:30.200
It was like a big mess.

0:05:30.200,0:05:36.040
My husband had taken me in
 India to many pastors.

0:05:36.040,0:05:39.100
They said that there was some force in me,

0:05:39.100,0:05:42.780
and they advised me to fast and pray.

0:05:42.780,0:05:49.700
I did 40 days fast, 21 days fast 
and seven days fast.

0:05:49.720,0:05:54.320
They advised me to do Esther fast,
 which is without water and food

0:05:54.320,0:05:58.040
for three days, and I did it but nothing happened.

0:05:58.040,0:06:02.800
I  was taken for prayers but the
 spirit in me never manifested.

0:06:02.800,0:06:05.020
Once I was back home from the prayer

0:06:05.020,0:06:07.300
I used to fight with my husband telling him:

0:06:07.300,0:06:13.160
"You are insulting me, taking me everywhere and saying that I have got some spirits".

0:06:13.160,0:06:18.160
It was like my husband was just in hell, I can say.

0:06:18.160,0:06:21.320
In the house, it was like in 'hell'

0:06:21.320,0:06:26.860
but when I was outside meeting people,
 I was such a humble person.

0:06:26.860,0:06:31.820
No one would ever think 
that I had such a behavior.

0:06:31.820,0:06:37.360
I am a nurse. At work, my 
concentration started diminishing.

0:06:37.360,0:06:41.680
I was not able to concentrate on
 anything I did.

0:06:41.680,0:06:45.380
After eight hours of work, I used to
run back to the hospital

0:06:45.380,0:06:48.540
to see whether my patients were alright

0:06:48.540,0:06:52.380
and the documentation that I was doing was correct.

0:06:52.380,0:06:55.980
People used to ask me why I 
used to go back again to the hospital.

0:06:55.980,0:06:58.280
I would say: "Oh no, I forgot something".

0:06:58.280,0:07:02.340
And then I used to check all the documents 
whether they were correct or not.

0:07:02.340,0:07:09.200
Later, because the trouble was
too much, we came to New Zealand in 2004.

0:07:09.200,0:07:11.740
Over there also, we went to many pastors,

0:07:11.740,0:07:14.260
they all said that there was some demonic attack,

0:07:14.260,0:07:17.600
but no one was able to deliver me.

0:07:17.600,0:07:21.640
When I was at work in the hospital, 
my husband used to google

0:07:21.640,0:07:27.680
to find pastors who could deliver me
and restore our family.

0:07:27.680,0:07:35.920
In 2009, he found our beloved Prophet TB Joshua

0:07:35.920,0:07:41.100
on YouTube, delivering people 
and that was how we came

0:07:41.100,0:07:46.240
to know about him and ever since
then we had been trying to come.

0:07:46.240,0:07:51.260
But demons know that this 
is the arena of liberty

0:07:51.260,0:07:58.560
and whoever steps into it,
the demons cannot stay on that person.

0:07:58.560,0:08:02.800
So this was what brought you and your husband to The SCOAN,

0:08:02.800,0:08:04.840
and we've seen the cassette of what happened,

0:08:04.840,0:08:07.280
how you were delivered in the name of Jesus.

0:08:07.280,0:08:12.280
So tell us, what was that deliverance like,
and since then how has life been?

0:08:12.280,0:08:19.140
On the 27th of February 2011,
it was a Sunday service,

0:08:19.140,0:08:22.380
we were allowed to sit in the front line.

0:08:22.380,0:08:27.960
The moment I was given the seat,
the spirit within me was

0:08:27.960,0:08:32.040
quite unsettled and was telling me to go back.

0:08:32.040,0:08:36.180
So I told my husband, "I don't 
want to sit in the front line. Shall I go back?"

0:08:36.180,0:08:41.420
But he just held my hand and said,
"No, no, no. Don't worry, we'll sit in the front".

0:08:41.420,0:08:46.840
I was a bit disturbed, I didn't want 
to say something to my husband.

0:08:46.840,0:08:53.840
So the spirit in me said: "Don't worry. You have gone to so many places, you won't be located".

0:08:53.840,0:09:00.420
But thanks be to God, when the man of God just came to me all of a sudden,

0:09:00.420,0:09:04.500
the light that was flashing from the man of God -

0:09:04.500,0:09:07.680
the spirit within me could not withstand that light.

0:09:07.680,0:09:14.820
The spirit was exposed and you have seen the deliverance that has taken place in my life.

0:09:14.820,0:09:20.040
Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
Glory be to God!

0:09:20.040,0:09:23.580
And now since your deliverance, tell us how life has been.

0:09:23.580,0:09:28.660
What have been the changes in your attitude towards your husband, towards the ministry and so on?

0:09:28.660,0:09:34.780
Thanks be to God that I was delivered 
and ever since then, I have been so light.

0:09:34.780,0:09:42.540
I slept like a baby the same night 
and ever since then there is no anger and hatred.

0:09:42.540,0:09:45.640
There is love - immense love.

0:09:45.640,0:09:50.480
As our prophet has taught us that 
we are the sons and daughters of love,

0:09:50.480,0:09:53.920
that same love is flowing through me.

0:09:53.920,0:09:58.380
I love my husband. Ever since then, 
there was no fight,

0:09:58.380,0:10:02.300
and there is no more confusion in our lives.

0:10:02.300,0:10:06.840
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:10:06.840,0:10:11.020
What a wonderful testimony of
a marriage and a family restored!

0:10:11.020,0:10:14.880
Now tell us, what is your advice to people who are going through the same kind of problem -

0:10:14.880,0:10:18.080
marital problem or marital difficulty all over the world?

0:10:18.080,0:10:22.020
Before that, I would like to say that the man of God prophesied to me,

0:10:22.020,0:10:26.940
saying that I'm going to help my husband with the gospel ministry

0:10:26.940,0:10:31.180
and I'm going to be an evangelist and that prophecy is true.

0:10:31.180,0:10:35.680
God gave me an opportunity for a year to study the Bible,

0:10:35.680,0:10:38.840
and I am sharing the Word to many people.

0:10:38.840,0:10:42.760
Now, I've gone back to my profession as a nurse,

0:10:42.760,0:10:49.800
working in NICU - that is neonatal 
premature babies in ICU.

0:10:49.800,0:10:54.240
I apply the Anointing Water every day before I go to work.

0:10:54.240,0:10:58.749
I pray with my husband and I take the sticker with me.

0:10:58.749,0:11:06.280
I put it inside my uniform and whenever I touch the babies, there will be miracles taking place.

0:11:06.280,0:11:11.880
Babies are getting healed before the doctors discharge them from the hospital.

0:11:11.880,0:11:14.700
Thank You, Jesus!

0:11:14.700,0:11:22.380
Thank You for setting us free and delivering us, Lord. 
We want to serve You, Lord.

0:11:22.380,0:11:27.680
Where there is solution, there is forgiveness.

0:11:27.680,0:11:31.740
Where there is no solution, there is no forgiveness.

0:11:31.740,0:11:33.900
This is solution.

0:11:33.900,0:11:37.340
Now, she is a wonderful woman.

0:11:37.340,0:11:47.080
It is the antecedent; it is biological make-up.

0:11:47.080,0:11:55.720
So now she is free, never in your life remind her again, no matter what happens in the house.

0:11:55.720,0:12:01.000
If you people disagree, that is 
an area you should not mention.

0:12:01.000,0:12:03.220
If you mention that, you offend God.

0:12:03.220,0:12:04.740
Thank you.

0:12:04.740,0:12:10.600
Thank you, Man of God!
Thank You, Jesus!

0:12:10.600,0:12:14.380
She is going to join you in the ministry.

0:12:14.380,0:12:16.660
Yes, she is going to join you. Wonderful!

0:12:16.660,0:12:24.540
She is an evangelist.
She is going to join you in the ministry.

0:12:24.540,0:12:25.500
Testimony Time

0:12:25.500,0:12:28.280
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:12:28.280,0:12:33.020
Put your hands together for Jesus, the Miracle Worker!

0:12:33.020,0:12:42.540
To the whole world, I would like to say especially to my Indian brothers and sisters back in our country,

0:12:42.540,0:12:50.500
it has been taught that being a Christian, demons cannot possess you or attack you.

0:12:50.500,0:12:54.080
That is a wrong teaching, my brothers and sisters.

0:12:54.080,0:13:05.180
Wherever in the family there is trouble, fight, disagreement, anger, alcoholism and smoking,

0:13:05.180,0:13:08.760
it means that you are possessed with demons.

0:13:08.760,0:13:14.620
Demons have invaded your 
family and you need to be delivered.

0:13:14.620,0:13:19.480
Come to this place, The SCOAN, Nigeria.

0:13:19.480,0:13:23.740
You can spend whatever you have to get yourself delivered,

0:13:23.740,0:13:29.200
to restore your family and everything 
shall be added unto you.

0:13:29.200,0:13:33.180
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands 
together for Jesus once again!

0:13:33.180,0:13:38.540
As we know, The SCOAN is just one of the many living churches all over the world.

0:13:38.540,0:13:42.180
And what our mother is advising 
us is that we must receive deliverance

0:13:42.180,0:13:45.440
to become a Christian or a truly born-again person.

0:13:45.440,0:13:48.300
You can receive deliverance in any living church

0:13:48.300,0:13:51.140
where the Holy Spirit is in charge all over the world.

0:13:51.140,0:13:53.460
Glory be to God! We thank God for your testimony.

0:13:53.460,0:13:56.500
We would love to hear a word from your husband now.

0:13:56.500,0:13:57.620
Sir, you are very welcome.

0:13:57.620,0:14:01.280
Please introduce yourself and share
your wonderful testimony with us.

0:14:01.280,0:14:03.840
I'm Matthew Varughese,

0:14:03.840,0:14:09.580
and my wife Rina Matthew and 
my daughter Marylin Matthew.

0:14:09.580,0:14:14.500
The prophetic message that 
was given during our deliverance,

0:14:14.500,0:14:16.840
especially for me to serve God,

0:14:16.840,0:14:21.740
and all this drama was taking place
because of my urge for serving God.

0:14:21.740,0:14:29.080
As the man of God says, faith attracts testing, and I was enduring for so many years.

0:14:29.080,0:14:34.800
We got married to have a good family life but I have seen hell on this earth.

0:14:34.800,0:14:41.000
But God helped me to stand; I only looked to Jesus Christ, who took everything on Himself.

0:14:41.000,0:14:45.200
Every day, I used to pray and read the Bible,

0:14:45.200,0:14:49.880
and that endurance made me to stand my ground.

0:14:49.880,0:14:52.740
Now the thing is that after that prophetic word,

0:14:52.740,0:14:57.060
he said that I should go and serve my GOD!

0:14:57.060,0:14:59.680
That opened a breakthrough for me

0:14:59.680,0:15:04.560
and after that, I have been used by God to pray for others

0:15:04.560,0:15:06.300
and a lot of breakthroughs have come.

0:15:06.300,0:15:12.840
God is using us nicely and I have really been strong enough now.

0:15:12.840,0:15:15.980
I need more grace but then I am strong enough.

0:15:15.980,0:15:20.720
God is helping me to do His work, 
and I'm happy with my family.

0:15:20.720,0:15:25.160
My wife understands me now; challenges come but we understand each other

0:15:25.160,0:15:28.100
and she is now able to assist me
in many things.

0:15:28.100,0:15:31.700
Glory be to God. So the prophecy 
of the man of God has exactly come true.

0:15:31.700,0:15:34.360
You have been able to serve the 
Lord in spirit and in truth.

0:15:34.360,0:15:38.500
Your ministry has had a breakthrough and your wife is assisting you in her role as an evangelist.

0:15:38.500,0:15:39.360
Is that right?

0:15:39.360,0:15:40.660
Yes, thank you.

0:15:40.660,0:15:44.620
Glory be to God. And what can you say about your wife's character towards you as her husband

0:15:44.620,0:15:47.860
and her character as a wife since the deliverance and the word of prophecy?

0:15:47.860,0:15:50.420
After the deliverance she takes care,

0:15:50.420,0:15:56.100
we sit and discuss so many things, we minister to people together,

0:15:56.100,0:16:01.820
and whenever people call us, we are able to pray together, before we pray for others.

0:16:01.820,0:16:04.640
Most of the situations are like what 
we have gone through in our life -

0:16:04.640,0:16:08.020
those problems are coming
so it is very easy to understand.

0:16:08.020,0:16:12.100
And as the man of God says that 
every cause has got a purpose

0:16:12.100,0:16:16.760
and that is really becoming true in our life,
and we are going through that.

0:16:16.760,0:16:23.180
Hallelujah! Let's put our 
hands together for Jesus!

0:16:23.180,0:16:26.720
Pastor, we can see your daughter
standing next to you here.

0:16:26.720,0:16:32.000
Can you tell us - what changes have you seen between your wife and your daughter

0:16:32.000,0:16:33.580
since the deliverance took place?

0:16:33.580,0:16:37.540
Before the deliverance, the problem 
was that she was not taken care of.

0:16:37.540,0:16:40.370
She felt always lonely because she is the only child

0:16:40.370,0:16:43.900
who was born to us after seven years of marriage.

0:16:43.900,0:16:46.800
So she was lonely. She was not been taken care of.

0:16:46.800,0:16:53.240
But now after the deliverance, she and her mother are able to give more time to each other,

0:16:53.240,0:16:56.420
and they are having a better understanding

0:16:56.420,0:16:59.720
and we are all happy together.

0:16:59.720,0:17:04.540
Hallelujah. So finally, pastor, give us your word of advice to people watching all over the world -

0:17:04.540,0:17:09.240
both to pastors and to married couples who should seek the face of the Lord.

0:17:09.240,0:17:16.640
I would like to say, Jesus Christ
is the God whose ministry is restoration.

0:17:16.640,0:17:20.400
As at the marriage of Cana,
the water was turned to wine,

0:17:20.400,0:17:24.240
when a family had the
problem of being short of wine.

0:17:24.240,0:17:30.340
And then Jesus was there. When we call upon Jesus Christ, He will make a way for us.

0:17:30.340,0:17:37.980
So never ever quit, stay in faith, call upon God; 
ask, seek, and knock.

0:17:37.980,0:17:41.440
And definitely God will make a way for you 
and He will deliver you.

0:17:41.440,0:17:47.580
Let's put our hands together
for Jesus Christ!

0:17:47.580,0:17:49.920
My name is Marilyn Matthew.

0:17:49.920,0:17:54.200
I'm from New Zealand. 
This is my mother Rina Matthew,

0:17:54.200,0:17:56.920
and that is my father Matthew Varughese.

0:17:56.920,0:18:01.900
In 2012, I came to The SCOAN.

0:18:01.900,0:18:05.420
The man of God prophesied that the same spirit

0:18:05.420,0:18:09.800
that was haunting my mother was also haunting me.

0:18:09.800,0:18:12.620
I can testify to that. Yes, it was haunting me

0:18:12.620,0:18:15.700
because there were so many things that I did.

0:18:15.700,0:18:21.920
I felt anger and frustration
that I never used to feel before.

0:18:21.920,0:18:27.300
After the man of God prophesied to me,
I got delivered.

0:18:27.300,0:18:32.480
I was set free. After that, there is
 happiness and peace in our family.

0:18:32.480,0:18:34.900
Hallelujah. So what would be your word of advice

0:18:34.900,0:18:38.280
to families watching you all over the world?

0:18:38.280,0:18:45.640
I would like to give advice to children because sometimes, when your parents are fighting

0:18:45.640,0:18:51.820
or your family is going through a bad situation, children are mostly affected.

0:18:51.820,0:18:55.900
And I want to tell them to hold on to Jesus, to pray to Jesus.

0:18:55.900,0:18:58.280
He will surely hear your prayers.

0:18:58.280,0:19:02.140
Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:19:02.140,0:19:04.980
Wonderful! You have demonstrated and you have experienced

0:19:04.980,0:19:08.360
that earth has no sorrow that Heaven does not feel.

0:19:08.360,0:19:12.660
When God Almighty is aware of your situation, He will not leave you without a solution.

0:19:12.660,0:19:15.100
And as God has met you at the point of your need

0:19:15.100,0:19:18.080
and is taking you from grace 
to grace and faith to faith,

0:19:18.080,0:19:20.940
we pray God Almighty will give you that grace to remain in His Word,

0:19:20.940,0:19:23.960
abide in His Word and allow the Word to abide in you

0:19:23.960,0:19:26.540
that this will be permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:19:26.540,0:19:30.480
Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:19:30.480,0:19:36.460
