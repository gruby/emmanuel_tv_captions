0:00:00.000,0:00:01.520
Hallelujah!

0:00:01.520,0:00:02.600
[Amen.]

0:00:02.600,0:00:06.080
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:06.080,0:00:08.320
Thank you.

0:00:08.320,0:00:10.080
Hallelujah.

0:00:10.080,0:00:21.640
I want to believe that you have realised that God is reliable.

0:00:21.640,0:00:22.680
[Yes]

0:00:22.680,0:00:28.420
If God is reliable, you put your trust in Him.

0:00:28.420,0:00:32.880
How do we put our trust in God?

0:00:32.880,0:00:37.280
By using our faith to put a demand.

0:00:37.280,0:00:46.820
You can’t just say, “I trust God because I've seen so much. I have seen He is not a man”.

0:00:46.820,0:00:56.760
You can’t come to the issue of trust without using your faith to put a demand on the anointing.

0:00:56.760,0:00:59.780
Anointing is the power of God.

0:00:59.780,0:01:02.260
When you see God, you see power.

0:01:02.260,0:01:05.040
When God smiles, power smiles.

0:01:05.040,0:01:07.360
When God looks, power looks.

0:01:07.360,0:01:10.680
When God moves, power moves. 
That is God!

0:01:10.680,0:01:12.600
Glory be to God.

0:01:12.600,0:01:22.800
God is honest, reliable, trustworthy and stable.

0:01:22.800,0:01:32.120
Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.

0:01:32.120,0:01:33.680
Are you with me?

0:01:33.680,0:01:35.220
Tell your neighbour,

0:01:35.220,0:01:48.840
“What is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God, big God – G O D.”

0:01:48.840,0:01:54.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:54.960,0:02:02.560
If you have realised that God is honest, based on you have seen - what else again?

0:02:02.560,0:02:10.360
God is honest, stable, trustworthy and reliable.

0:02:10.360,0:02:16.420
Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith,

0:02:16.420,0:02:18.860
because you demand greater faith - no,

0:02:18.860,0:02:22.100
but a greater God.

0:02:22.100,0:02:27.120
Viewers all over the world, I know you are at home.

0:02:27.120,0:02:30.600
When I say "at home" I mean in Him.

0:02:30.600,0:02:33.340
Your home is not here.

0:02:33.340,0:02:37.120
This reminds me of the woman with the issue of blood.

0:02:37.120,0:02:40.400
She believed enough.

0:02:40.400,0:02:41.640
You say, "I believe".

0:02:41.640,0:02:42.820
What do you mean by "believe"?

0:02:42.820,0:02:45.160
You believe enough.

0:02:45.160,0:02:53.060
She believed enough and pressed through the crowd to touch Jesus.

0:02:53.060,0:02:57.980
There was so much crowd. "How would I go? I don't want to push. I'm not strong".

0:02:57.980,0:03:05.500
But she believed enough to press through crowd to touch who?

0:03:05.500,0:03:07.600
To touch who?

0:03:07.600,0:03:10.400
To touch Jesus.

0:03:10.400,0:03:14.880
Press in to touch Jesus.

0:03:14.880,0:03:19.860
Tell your neighbour, "Press in to touch Jesus."

0:03:19.860,0:03:20.960
I cannot hear you.

0:03:20.960,0:03:23.300
[Press in to touch Jesus.]

0:03:23.300,0:03:24.460
Tell your neighbour.

0:03:24.460,0:03:26.600
[Press in to touch Jesus.]

0:03:26.600,0:03:34.580
Press in to touch Jesus to heal and deliver you.

0:03:34.580,0:03:35.880
I cannot hear you.

0:03:35.880,0:03:38.160
[Press in to touch Jesus to heal and deliver you.]

0:03:38.160,0:03:50.620
Say, “I press in to touch Him. Oh, Lord Jesus, heal me!”

0:03:50.620,0:03:56.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:56.400,0:04:00.420
Yes, what is good her is good for you.

0:04:00.420,0:04:13.740
The Bible says that she believed enough – not just believed – she believed enough to press in.

0:04:13.740,0:04:22.520
There was so much crowd, not only crowd - hindrance, obstacle...

0:04:22.520,0:04:28.440
If it was a gentle crowd... but this one the Bible called a throng.

0:04:28.440,0:04:32.580
There was so much noise; you could see a thug, you could see a street boy.

0:04:32.580,0:04:37.100
A lot of them were following Jesus...

0:04:37.100,0:04:44.720
The Bible says that she believed enough to press through; through what?

0:04:44.720,0:04:46.720
Crowd.

0:04:46.720,0:04:48.860
To touch Jesus.

0:04:48.860,0:04:57.640
You must press in to touch Him to heal you.

0:04:57.640,0:04:58.880
Say, “I believe”.

0:04:58.880,0:04:59.980
[I believe.]

0:04:59.980,0:05:01.020
I cannot hear you.

0:05:01.020,0:05:02.860
[I believe.]

0:05:02.860,0:05:04.860
You must believe enough.

0:05:04.860,0:05:13.240
I press in to touch You, oh Lord; heal me.

0:05:13.240,0:05:20.980
Say after me, "I press in to touch You."

0:05:20.980,0:05:24.460
Write it down - that should be your prayer point today.

0:05:24.460,0:05:43.900
I press in to touch You, oh Lord Jesus; heal, deliver and bless me.

0:05:43.900,0:05:58.080
Let Your seraphim touch me.

0:05:58.080,0:06:08.400
I press it to touch You, oh Lord; heal me.

0:06:08.400,0:06:13.400
Let Your seraphim touch me.

0:06:13.400,0:06:24.680
It is Jesus
Yes it is Jesus

0:06:24.680,0:06:34.620
It is Jesus
In my soul

0:06:34.620,0:06:45.860
For I have touched
The hem of His garment

0:06:45.860,0:06:53.420
And His blood
Has made me whole

0:06:53.420,0:06:54.620
Your voice.

0:06:54.620,0:07:05.660
It is Jesus
Yes it is Jesus

0:07:05.660,0:07:17.980
It is Jesus
In my soul

0:07:17.980,0:07:27.120
For I have touched
The hem of His garment

0:07:27.120,0:07:35.380
And His blood
Has made me whole

0:07:35.380,0:07:48.520
It is Jesus
Yes it is Jesus

0:07:48.520,0:07:59.440
It is Jesus
In my soul

0:07:59.440,0:08:09.040
For I have touched
The hem of His garment

0:08:09.040,0:08:22.100
And His blood
Has made me whole

0:08:22.100,0:08:33.820
I press in to touch You; Jesus, heal me.

0:08:33.820,0:08:45.860
I press in to touch You; Jesus, deliver me.

0:08:45.860,0:08:57.480
I press in to touch You; Jesus, bless me.

0:08:57.480,0:09:08.200
Let Your seraphim touch me, in Jesus’ name.

0:09:08.200,0:09:10.720
Be ready for a touch.

0:09:10.720,0:09:11.600
Are you ready?

0:09:11.600,0:09:12.580
[Yes.]

0:09:12.580,0:09:15.780
You may be seated.
Thank you.

0:09:15.780,0:09:17.020
What is your name?

0:09:17.020,0:09:18.660
My name is Favour Okere.

0:09:18.660,0:09:21.260
Good. What happened?

0:09:21.260,0:09:26.000
I have the problem of scoliosis of my spine.

0:09:26.000,0:09:29.820
My spine is curved; and I am sure that God will help me.

0:09:29.820,0:09:32.380
Remove the world "sure".

0:09:32.380,0:09:33.600
OK?

0:09:33.600,0:09:35.020
Say, "I believe."

0:09:35.020,0:09:36.760
I believe.

0:09:36.760,0:09:39.940
I believe that God will heal me.

0:09:39.940,0:09:53.840
You say after me, "I press in to touch Him, oh Lord, heal me."

0:09:53.840,0:09:55.280
Stretch your hand.

0:09:55.280,0:10:00.280
I press in to touch Him, oh Lord, heal me.

0:10:00.280,0:10:02.380
Rise up.

0:10:02.380,0:10:04.320
Remove it.

0:10:04.320,0:10:08.020
Let her remove it by herself.

0:10:08.020,0:10:09.240
Touch your body again.

0:10:09.240,0:10:13.100
I press in to touch You...

0:10:13.100,0:10:15.580
That "You" is Jesus, OK?

0:10:15.580,0:10:20.480
"I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me."

0:10:20.480,0:10:21.720
Amen.

0:10:21.720,0:10:23.160
You can go.

0:10:23.160,0:10:34.640
Healed In Jesus’ Name

0:10:34.640,0:10:40.900
Yes, this is exactly what the woman with the issue of blood said.

0:10:40.900,0:10:44.740
Jesus said, “Somebody touched Me, ...

0:10:44.740,0:10:45.900
Let someone say it.

0:10:45.900,0:10:47.240
[Somebody touched me!]

0:10:47.240,0:10:48.240
I cannot hear you.

0:10:48.240,0:10:49.460
[Somebody touched me!]

0:10:49.460,0:10:58.260
... for I perceive power has gone out from Me”.

0:10:58.260,0:11:01.360
Let somebody say, "Somebody touched Me".

0:11:01.360,0:11:02.580
I cannot hear you!

0:11:02.580,0:11:04.020
[Somebody touched me!]

0:11:04.020,0:11:07.020
Thank you.

0:11:07.020,0:11:13.060
Yes. When the woman said, "I press in touch you, oh Lord, heal me",

0:11:13.060,0:11:16.500
immediately Jesus said, "Somebody touched me".

0:11:16.500,0:11:19.900
Please man of God help me.

0:11:19.900,0:11:25.640
I have a stiff neck due to spondylolysis

0:11:25.640,0:11:28.220
I have been booked for an operation.

0:11:28.220,0:11:31.680
I also have spinal cord stenosis.

0:11:31.680,0:11:39.900
The doctor said that if I am not operated on time it would affect my spinal cord and I become parallelized.

0:11:39.900,0:11:41.920
Help me man of God.

0:11:41.920,0:11:43.780
Please man of God help my husband.

0:11:43.780,0:11:45.660
He has been booked for an operation.

0:11:45.660,0:11:52.020
He has stiff neck and stenosis of the spinal cord.

0:11:52.020,0:11:54.100
OK. Come on.

0:11:54.100,0:11:54.740
Stand up.

0:11:54.740,0:11:56.440
Listen to your little one.

0:11:56.440,0:12:11.280
OK. Say, "I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me."

0:12:11.280,0:12:18.440
I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me.

0:12:18.440,0:12:32.000
Healed In Jesus’ Name

0:12:32.000,0:12:40.460
I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me.

0:12:40.460,0:12:54.220
Somebody touched Me, for I perceive power has gone out from Me.

0:12:54.220,0:12:55.860
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:55.860,0:12:57.260
I am healed.

0:12:57.260,0:12:58.380
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:58.380,0:13:00.600
I can now turn my head.

0:13:00.600,0:13:04.680
I can now bend forward and backward.

0:13:04.680,0:13:08.140
What are we learning?

0:13:08.140,0:13:11.700
Faith – your faith is growing.

0:13:11.700,0:13:14.600
You are now seeing that Jesus is reliable.

0:13:14.600,0:13:18.120
Man of God, I have a dislocation of the elbow joint due to accident...

0:13:18.120,0:13:19.740
Where were you going?

0:13:19.740,0:13:21.380
I was at work.

0:13:21.380,0:13:22.600
Come on.

0:13:22.600,0:13:23.580
Stand up.

0:13:23.580,0:13:25.040
You listened to the message?

0:13:25.040,0:13:25.700
Yes, Sir.

0:13:25.700,0:13:28.260
What the messages is all about?

0:13:28.260,0:13:31.580
It is about pressing on to hold on to my faith.

0:13:31.580,0:13:36.680
You are pressing in this time, not on.

0:13:36.680,0:13:42.260
You have to press in, because the situation is tough, because your faith is not strong.

0:13:42.260,0:13:43.700
You cannot press on.

0:13:43.700,0:13:44.620
I press in.

0:13:44.620,0:13:51.180
I press in to hold on to faith.

I am suffering from lumbar scoliosis.

0:15:11.880,0:15:12.720
You say what?

0:15:12.720,0:15:15.260
I am suffering from lumbar spondylolysis.

0:15:15.260,0:15:20.600
I thought that I am the only person that doesn't know how to spell it - that...

0:15:20.600,0:15:24.540
I have a colleague now.

0:15:24.540,0:15:30.060
This spondylolysis - I have looked at it in my dictionary "to get it easy".

0:15:30.060,0:15:31.520
It is very difficult for me.

0:15:31.520,0:15:36.060
But now I find someone who is my partner :)

0:15:36.060,0:15:37.320
How do you call it?

0:15:37.320,0:15:38.420
Spondulosis.

0:15:38.420,0:15:39.640
Lumbar ?spondulosis?

0:15:39.640,0:15:40.800
?Cororosis?

0:16:37.140,0:16:38.960

Let someone say, “I press in to touch You, oh Lord; free me.”

0:17:31.620,0:17:42.020
Somebody touched Me, for I perceive power has gone out from Me.

0:17:42.020,0:17:44.060
Yes, He senses power.

0:17:44.060,0:17:51.320

0:17:59.140,0:18:07.320
When I was praying
Praying to my Father

0:18:07.320,0:18:14.200
Somebody touched my soul

0:18:14.200,0:18:22.820
It must be Jesus
It must be Jesus

0:18:22.820,0:18:31.560
Jesus Christ touched my soul

0:18:31.560,0:18:39.840
When I was praying
Praying to my Father

0:18:39.840,0:18:45.920
Jesus Christ touched my soul

0:18:45.920,0:18:49.160
Somebody touched Me,

0:18:49.160,0:18:50.140
I cannot hear you.

0:18:50.140,0:18:51.740
Somebody touched Me

0:18:51.740,0:18:52.880
I cannot hear you.

0:18:52.880,0:19:02.340
Somebody touched Me, for I perceive power has gone out from Me.

0:19:02.340,0:19:06.140
Somebody touched Me!

0:19:06.140,0:19:07.280
Who?

0:19:07.280,0:19:12.300
Me.

0:19:12.300,0:19:13.540
Glory be to God.

0:19:13.540,0:19:15.020
[Amen.]

0:19:15.020,0:19:22.180
It is time now to continue your mediation in your heart.

0:19:22.180,0:19:24.900
What are you meditating?

0:19:24.900,0:19:32.720
Lord Jesus, make me Your channel – a channel of pardon.

0:19:32.720,0:19:38.780
Make me Your channel – a channel of forgiveness.

0:19:38.780,0:19:47.340
Make me You channel – a channel of purity, oh, Lord Jesus.

0:19:47.340,0:19:50.080
Simple - those are the things you should meditate on.

0:19:50.080,0:19:54.020
You may be seated while your meditation goes on.

0:19:54.020,0:19:57.000
That is the only way you can be delivered.

0:19:57.000,0:20:01.200
The kind of prayer you offer nowadays cannot help you.

0:20:01.200,0:20:08.020
You are used to...

0:20:08.020,0:20:09.820
All those things cannot help you.

0:20:09.820,0:20:13.000
If this thing could help you, it would have helped you.

0:20:13.000,0:20:18.680
Tell your neighbour, "If this prayer could help you, it would have helped you".

0:20:18.680,0:20:23.880
You know, you have been in it...

0:20:23.880,0:20:24.920
This can not help you.

0:20:24.920,0:20:28.500
You need meditation to get out of this mess.

0:20:28.500,0:20:34.700
Tell your neighbour, "You need meditation to get out of this mess."

0:20:34.700,0:20:39.820
If Jesus is Spirit you need to begin to make that noise.

0:20:39.820,0:20:47.520
But you shout "Jesus" not in church but at home, as He were your neighbour.

0:20:47.520,0:20:51.360
Those things are hypocritical.

0:20:51.360,0:20:55.920
People choose to be religious, from where we all came from.

0:20:55.920,0:21:01.160
We were religious men, before we turned to Christianity.

0:21:01.160,0:21:04.940
Today, people are going back to their religious systems.

0:21:04.940,0:21:08.240
There is hypocrisy in it.

0:21:08.240,0:21:14.340
There is no unity, envy jealousy among the churches,

0:21:14.340,0:21:16.660
"This one is devil.
This one is satan."

0:21:16.660,0:21:19.480
Who is now a child of God?

0:21:19.480,0:21:23.620
The devil and satan now turned to be a child of God.

0:21:23.620,0:21:29.500
There is so much hypocrisy, disunity...

0:21:29.500,0:21:33.300
Meditation is a visit with God.

0:21:33.300,0:21:34.360
Tell your neighbour.

0:21:34.360,0:21:37.140
[Meditation is a visit with God.]

0:21:37.140,0:21:42.620
This is why the Bible says, “Pray without ceasing”.

0:21:42.620,0:21:47.640
Prayer is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the body.

0:21:47.640,0:21:55.420
Today's prayer becomes the thing of the body, but it is a thing of a heart.

0:21:55.420,0:21:58.380
I can be talking to you now, but I am praying at the same time.

0:21:58.380,0:21:59.460
How this is possible?

0:21:59.460,0:22:03.000
I'm talking to you and at the same time I'm praying.

0:22:03.000,0:22:08.720
It is possible because a prayer is the thing of the heart.

0:22:08.720,0:22:17.040
Our heart can do 10 things at the same time – it is a place of God, it is a place of meditation,

0:22:17.040,0:22:20.040
it is a place of communion.

0:22:20.040,0:22:23.560
it is a place of holiness,

0:22:23.560,0:22:26.220
it is a place of direction,

0:22:26.220,0:22:30.960
it is a place of ministry – that is heart.

0:22:30.960,0:22:38.520
If you say you must shout when you pray, how do you pray when you sleep?

0:22:38.520,0:22:41.760
And you are also supposed to pray while you are sleeping.

0:22:41.760,0:22:47.060
The way blood runs in our system is the way prayer should also run.

0:22:47.060,0:22:48.640
It is an integral part.

0:22:48.640,0:22:51.680
It is an article of faith.

0:22:51.680,0:22:54.040
These are the things you need to break through.

0:22:54.040,0:22:56.820
You need to get this right to be saved.

0:22:56.820,0:23:01.480
If not, satan knows when you are not praying and he will catch you.

0:23:01.480,0:23:04.400
He will never catch you while you are praying;

0:23:04.400,0:23:07.700
he knows you do not pray all the time, you have a time for prayer.

0:23:07.700,0:23:11.020
Those times you are not praying, he normally catches you.

0:23:11.020,0:23:14.680
When you look at the problems you had, they were at times you were not praying.

0:23:14.680,0:23:16.040
You say, "I am going to pray."

0:23:16.040,0:23:19.800
Before you get there satan catches you.

0:23:19.800,0:23:23.880
Satan knows those things and he had been catching you like that.

0:23:23.880,0:23:30.560
This is why 90% of attacks today are in the dream.

0:23:30.560,0:23:34.380
Because he know that you are empty while you are sleeping.

0:23:34.380,0:23:38.800
When they attack you in the dream, the thing will manifest in the real life.

0:23:38.800,0:23:44.160
When one was attacked yesterday night, the thing will start manifesting today.

0:23:44.160,0:23:53.380
If it was a gun shoot, it will start manifesting and it will happen in one of the following days.

0:23:53.380,0:24:01.600
It might have been a food given to you in the dream; when you wake up the thing will begin to manifest.

0:24:01.600,0:24:05.960
Something like that ... definitely.

0:24:05.960,0:24:11.500
They decided to attack you in the dream because they know you do not have the power of meditation.

0:24:11.500,0:24:17.420
When you meditate, you meditate throughout and when you sleep, meditation continues

0:24:17.420,0:24:20.500
because it is a power of God; it is not your power.

0:24:20.500,0:24:24.120
This prayer you offer today is your own power, not God's power.

0:24:24.120,0:24:26.800
Therefore, you can not operate in the dream.

0:24:26.800,0:24:30.960
When you meditate and finally sleep, the meditation will continue

0:24:30.960,0:24:33.380
because it is your heart that is doing it.

0:24:33.380,0:24:36.380
Your heart will never cease while sleeping.

0:24:36.380,0:24:42.500
Your heart functions while you are sleeping and the same heart is the one of mediation.

0:24:42.500,0:24:50.000
Your body ceases immediately when you sleep but the heart continues.

0:24:50.000,0:24:53.760
Meditation is of heart.

0:24:53.760,0:25:01.500
That meditation will become revelation that manifests through your life.

0:25:01.500,0:25:08.720
Where there is darkness, and you ask God to make you a channel of light - there is an attack from darkness

0:25:08.720,0:25:17.900
- you just see a manifestation of it because you are a channel of light to God.

0:25:17.900,0:25:20.880
Heart needs to be delivered to meditate.

0:25:20.880,0:25:22.260
Tell your neighbour.

0:25:22.260,0:25:24.240
[Heart needs to be delivered to meditate.]

0:25:24.240,0:25:25.640
To meditate.

0:25:25.640,0:25:33.080
Heart that is H E A R T.

0:25:33.080,0:25:36.060
Heart means your spirit.

0:25:36.060,0:25:37.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:25:37.040,0:25:38.360
[Heart means your spirit.]

0:25:38.360,0:25:41.660
When I say heart I mean your spirit.

0:25:41.660,0:25:44.740
Man's spirit means heart.

0:25:44.740,0:25:51.500
Your heart needs to be delivered to meditate because a lot of things are going on in your heart.

0:25:51.500,0:25:59.640
To receive is very simple – healing and deliverance are on your table already;

0:25:59.640,0:26:03.680
how will you maintain them?

0:26:03.680,0:26:10.600
You can not maintain even your life, your hair, your dress, your suit - you can not maintain.

0:26:10.600,0:26:12.920
You cannot even maintain your home.

0:26:12.920,0:26:15.900
You cannot maintain children given to you by God.

0:26:15.900,0:26:19.640
You cannot maintain your husband or your wife.

0:26:19.640,0:26:21.960
You cannot maintain the car you have.

0:26:21.960,0:26:24.320
Not to mention heavenly resources.

0:26:24.320,0:26:31.440
You cannot maintain your business, salary, the money you receive.

0:26:31.440,0:26:34.560
Even your shoes - you cannot maintain them.

0:26:34.560,0:26:39.620
It is better not to receive than to receive without what?

0:26:39.620,0:26:41.180
[Maintenance.]

0:26:41.180,0:26:42.800
It is better not to...

0:26:42.800,0:26:44.340
If I want to give you this.

0:26:44.340,0:26:48.800
If you know you cannot maintain it - don't receive it.

0:26:48.800,0:26:52.200
You can only receive it when you know you can maintain it

0:26:52.200,0:26:58.420
because you will need it more dearly tomorrow, not today.

0:26:58.420,0:27:03.940
What you are about receive today, you will need so dearly tomorrow.

0:27:03.940,0:27:07.140
Today you need healing - it is true, you need healing.

0:27:07.140,0:27:09.840
But you need a better one tomorrow.

0:27:09.840,0:27:16.560
If you now lose it at the time you need it most - what is the use of it?

0:27:16.560,0:27:19.200
That is why we are talking of maintenance.

0:27:19.200,0:27:20.540
Yes.

0:27:20.540,0:27:27.980
Meditation is a tool you can use to receive from God.

0:27:27.980,0:27:37.160
Meditation is a tool you can use to receive from Heavenly Father.

0:27:37.160,0:27:41.080
What are we meditating on?

0:27:41.080,0:27:42.340
The word of God.

0:27:42.340,0:27:47.640
If anyone tells you that you can meditate without heart, that is not meditation; it is thinking.

0:27:47.640,0:27:52.880
Thinking is in lower-house, meditation is upper-house – heart.

0:27:52.880,0:27:59.260
Thinking is a sitting room, meditation is a bed room.

0:27:59.260,0:28:04.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:04.500,0:28:09.100
If I were just a visitor, you would not allow me to enter your bed room.

0:28:09.100,0:28:16.020
You will receive me in your sitting room, entertain me and do whatever you want to do and discharge me.

0:28:16.020,0:28:20.480
But I must be a part of the house before I can enter your bed room.

0:28:20.480,0:28:26.080
Meditation is a bed room, thinking is a sitting room.

0:28:26.080,0:28:34.140
This is why we say the Word must be an integral part of you – live in you, dominate you, rule you.

0:28:34.140,0:28:36.640
When you are delivered, your heart will be free.

0:28:36.640,0:28:37.600
[Amen.]

0:28:37.600,0:28:42.320
Meditation can only work when you have a free spirit – free heart.

0:28:42.320,0:28:43.560
A free heart meditates.

0:28:43.560,0:28:44.440
Tell your neighbour.

0:28:44.440,0:28:45.960
[A free heart meditates.]

0:28:45.960,0:28:48.080
A free spirit meditates.

0:28:48.080,0:28:49.540
[A free spirit meditates.]

0:28:49.540,0:28:55.540
You think, "How will I solve my problem? I own a debt. I'm tired of this world.

0:28:55.540,0:28:58.120
All my family - we are poor."

0:28:58.120,0:29:03.640
All this thinking...

0:29:03.640,0:29:07.200
You need to leave all this for God.

0:29:07.200,0:29:14.680
When you leave it for God, He is able; you can meditate with your heart.

0:29:14.680,0:29:17.820
This is what I mean by self-will.

0:29:17.820,0:29:23.100
Self-will around your heart will never allow your heart to meditate.

0:29:23.100,0:29:28.340
We meditate in the power of God when our heart is free.

0:29:28.340,0:29:31.580
And one’s heart can be free when we are delivered.
