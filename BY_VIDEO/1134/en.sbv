Now, let’s look for peace – the little you have will be sufficient.

0:00:11.680,0:00:22.200
Tell your neighbour, “Look for peace – peace of heart – the little you have will be sufficient”.

0:00:22.200,0:00:30.960
Without peace, if you have the whole world, you are in trouble.

0:00:30.960,0:00:35.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:35.660,0:00:46.640
Tell your neighbour once again, “Look for peace – peace of heart – the little, the atom you have will be sufficient”.

0:00:46.640,0:00:57.640
Without the peace of heart, if you have the whole world, you will have trouble.

That will be the summary of my message.

0:01:03.520,0:01:10.220
When you wake up in the morning, you are looking, you want to be great, rich - you are looking for money,

0:01:10.220,0:01:15.140
business - you are ready to do anything to get it.

0:01:15.140,0:01:19.600
Anything to get it cannot give you a peace of heart.

0:01:19.600,0:01:29.220
The only thing that will give you peace of heart is to consider your neighbour

0:01:29.220,0:01:31.960
while looking for your own.

0:01:31.960,0:01:32.740
Tell your neighbour:

0:01:32.740,0:01:40.500
“The only thing that will give you peace of heart is to consider your neighbour

0:01:40.500,0:01:45.580
while looking for your way out”.

0:01:45.580,0:01:49.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:49.300,0:01:58.720
If you don’t consider your neighbour while looking for the way out of your problem,

0:01:58.720,0:02:05.500
you have not considered Jesus, your Creator.

0:02:05.500,0:02:12.660
Remember, your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.

0:02:12.660,0:02:14.080
Once again,

0:02:14.080,0:02:23.980
the only way you can have that peace of heart is to always consider your neighbour,

0:02:23.980,0:02:29.520
while searching for the way out.

0:02:29.520,0:02:33.680
Your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.

0:02:33.680,0:02:36.620
Your neighbour can be your enemy.

0:02:36.620,0:02:43.180
Your neighbour can be your friend.

0:02:43.180,0:02:51.140
While looking for the way out of your mess, difficulties, whatever situation you have;

0:02:51.140,0:02:58.160
when you are looking for a way, "How will I get this business done? I'm poor. I want to apply for a business.",

0:02:58.160,0:03:00.940
consider your neighbour.

0:03:00.940,0:03:02.840
What has happened to your neighbour?

0:03:02.840,0:03:11.320
If your neighbour is entitled to the same business, and you want to take it by any mean -

0:03:11.320,0:03:14.200
you want to do anything to take that business,

0:03:14.200,0:03:20.400
and you know your neighbour is the best for that business, but you have a way of taking it,

0:03:20.400,0:03:25.660
you continue to take it - no peace of heart.

0:03:25.660,0:03:27.520
Write it down.

0:03:27.520,0:03:34.020
While looking for a way out, always consider your neighbour.

0:03:34.020,0:03:40.040
Your neighbour can be your friend, your enemy, can be those who do not share the same faith with you -

0:03:40.040,0:03:45.960
consider them!

0:03:45.960,0:03:48.360
Do you know the reason why you have to consider your neighbour,

0:03:48.360,0:03:50.720
those who do not share the same faith with you?

0:03:50.720,0:03:56.580
Your enemy today may be your saviour tomorrow.

0:03:56.580,0:04:02.560
It may be the one to take you to the promised land - your greatest enemy today.

0:04:02.560,0:04:13.340
Your greatest enemy, that wants you to die, that is after your life, is the number one enemy today,

0:04:13.340,0:04:17.260
may be your saviour any moment from now,

0:04:17.260,0:04:24.000
and will be the one to take you to the promised land.

0:04:24.000,0:04:26.220
I take it back again.

0:04:26.220,0:04:33.600
While looking for a way out, consider your neighbour.

0:04:33.600,0:04:36.560
What does that mean?

0:04:36.560,0:04:41.940
Wish your neighbour as you wish yourself.

0:04:41.940,0:04:50.200
Stop that your prayer; you want to kill your enemy...

0:04:50.200,0:04:53.760
If you say you want to kill your enemy...

0:04:53.760,0:05:01.520
You know, you were once an enemy to someone else before, and you were not killed.

0:05:01.520,0:05:05.100
But today, you want to kill your enemy.

0:05:05.100,0:05:11.700
And that person who is your enemy - he wants to kill you in the same way you want to kill him.

0:05:11.700,0:05:15.560
You are wasting your time, killing your enemy, when the Lord said,

0:05:15.560,0:05:19.980
"I will set a table before you, in the presence of your enemy".

0:05:19.980,0:05:24.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:24.500,0:05:27.020
You are wasting your time.

0:05:27.020,0:05:31.720
Because the Lord said, "I will set a table before you, in the presence of your who"?

0:05:31.720,0:05:37.040
If you have killed them, who will be there to see your goodness?

0:05:37.040,0:05:39.360
Who will testify to your goodness?

0:05:39.360,0:05:44.740
Look at you - 99% of people today were once my enemies who wanted to kill me.

0:05:44.740,0:05:51.300
You were fasting, praying, binding me and loosing at the same time.

0:05:51.300,0:05:56.040
In the past, 90% of people sitting here today;

0:05:56.040,0:06:02.920
anytime they saw Emmanuel TV, "Please! Switch it off. Over my dead body, I will come to that church.",

0:06:02.920,0:06:08.400
but your real  body is here today, because you are not killed.

0:06:08.400,0:06:13.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:13.900,0:06:16.060
Because you are not killed...

0:06:16.060,0:06:23.260
Don't waste your time - I don't waste my time, because I know where I'm going.

0:06:23.260,0:06:25.720
Because we don't know where we are going.

0:06:25.720,0:06:31.260
If you knew where you are going, you will not waste your time over your enemy;

0:06:31.260,0:06:35.120
no enemy can stop you from where you are going.

0:06:35.120,0:06:41.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:41.780,0:06:48.780
Because you believe they can stop you, that is why you want to stop them - no!

0:06:48.780,0:06:55.480
Do and let me do - your life is just...

0:06:55.480,0:06:59.280
Please; there are many things we need to know that will guide us.

0:06:59.280,0:07:05.660
When you want to pray, ask for God's mercy and His favour, and thank Him,

0:07:05.660,0:07:10.820
and let Him know that here you are.

0:07:10.820,0:07:15.820
If you want someone, He should send you and leave that prayer.

0:07:15.820,0:07:20.760
Stop wasting your time over your enemy.

0:07:20.760,0:07:27.620
For how long?

0:07:27.620,0:07:34.140
I want to leave you - please, take this message.

0:07:34.140,0:07:34.640
