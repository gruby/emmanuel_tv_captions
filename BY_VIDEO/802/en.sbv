0:00:00.000,0:00:16.320
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

0:00:16.320,0:00:34.220
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

0:00:34.220,0:00:52.040
It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

0:00:52.040,0:01:08.300
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

0:01:08.300,0:01:26.600
My chains are gone I've been set free
My God my Saviour has ransomed me

0:01:26.600,0:01:50.400
And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

0:01:50.400,0:02:08.120
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

0:02:08.120,0:02:25.500
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

0:02:25.500,0:02:43.020
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

0:02:43.020,0:02:59.600
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

0:02:59.600,0:03:16.020
My chains are gone I've been set free
My God my Saviour has ransomed me

0:03:16.020,0:03:33.160
And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

0:03:33.160,0:03:49.860
My chains are gone I've been set free
My God my Saviour has ransomed me

0:03:49.860,0:04:06.500
And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

0:04:06.500,0:04:23.320
My chains are gone I've been set free
My God my Saviour has ransomed me

0:04:23.320,0:04:39.640
And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

0:04:39.640,0:04:57.400
My chains are gone I've been set free
My God my Saviour has ransomed me

0:04:57.400,0:05:27.920
And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

0:05:27.920,0:05:33.980
Put your hands together for the amazing Christ.

0:05:33.980,0:05:47.800
Today, let's usher ourselves; let's look at the book of Jeremiah.

0:05:47.800,0:05:55.320
Jeremiah 31, let me take verse 34.

0:05:55.320,0:06:04.300
"No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord',

0:06:04.300,0:06:13.180
because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord,

0:06:13.180,0:06:26.840
for I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

0:06:26.840,0:06:29.660
This is what the Lord says.

0:06:29.660,0:06:31.420
Are you there?

0:06:31.420,0:06:36.400
That verse 34; it is all about forgiveness.

0:06:36.400,0:06:38.480
FORGIVENESS AND UNFORGIVENESS

0:06:38.480,0:06:46.020
Forgiveness – you don’t give; you don't get.

0:06:46.020,0:06:49.240
That is all about forgiveness.

0:06:49.240,0:06:54.180
Forgiveness – you don’t give; you don't get.

0:06:54.180,0:06:57.140
You don’t give; you don't receive.

0:06:57.140,0:07:01.600
That is all about forgiveness.

0:07:01.600,0:07:03.160
Hallelujah!

0:07:03.160,0:07:04.980
Are you there?

0:07:04.980,0:07:11.940
Forgiveness – you don’t give; you don't get.

0:07:11.940,0:07:16.260
I mean, you don’t give; you don't receive.

0:07:16.260,0:07:22.540
You have a full detail about forgiveness in the Book of Mark 11 from verse 1 to the end.

0:07:22.540,0:07:24.120
Mark 11:1-end

0:07:24.120,0:07:28.200
About FORGIVENESS AND UNFORGIVENESS

0:07:28.200,0:07:34.920
What we have seen today is all about - you don't give; you don't receive.

0:07:34.920,0:07:36.060
Tell your neighbour.

0:07:36.060,0:07:38.880
[You don’t give; you don't receive.]

0:07:38.880,0:07:41.220
What you give is what you receive.

0:07:41.220,0:07:43.080
[What you give is what you receive.]

0:07:43.080,0:07:44.280
I cannot hear you.

0:07:44.280,0:07:46.380
[What you give is what you receive.]

0:07:46.380,0:07:54.360
If you give what you don’t need, you will receive what you don’t need.

0:07:54.360,0:07:58.860
If you give what your life depends on – what you cherish most,

0:07:58.860,0:08:04.280
you will receive what your life depends on – what you cherish most.

0:08:04.280,0:08:08.780
There are many material things we don't need.

0:08:08.780,0:08:11.720
You pretend to forgive...

0:08:11.720,0:08:20.500
There are things that you don't need, or you give your waste time, time you don't need.

0:08:20.500,0:08:23.960
Look at yourself here today.

0:08:23.960,0:08:27.720
It is not that this time is very important to you.

0:08:27.720,0:08:34.860
You are here because there is no other business out there, and nothing functions today.

0:08:34.860,0:08:38.460
You cannot cash money in the bank, there is nothing...

0:08:38.460,0:08:44.820
You are here as if you are giving God your best time.

0:08:44.820,0:08:47.400
What you give is what you receive.

0:08:47.400,0:08:55.540
If you give what you don't need; the material in your store, used tire...

0:08:55.540,0:09:01.960
Those tires that you know could lead to a death - and you are giving it to your neighbour.

0:09:01.960,0:09:07.020
Your neighbour needs a tire and you give him a tire - you are setting a trap for your neighbour.

0:09:07.020,0:09:08.840
You are about to kill your neighbour.

0:09:08.840,0:09:11.240
Many people died because of that.

0:09:11.240,0:09:15.400
You might have killed many people which you don't know - indirectly.

0:09:15.400,0:09:16.800
You say that you are not a murderer.

0:09:16.800,0:09:19.200
Who told that you are not a murderer?

0:09:19.200,0:09:23.120
What about those used tires you gave your friend in the past?

0:09:23.120,0:09:27.100
You heard that your friend had an accident...

0:09:27.100,0:09:30.900
It was the cause of the death.

0:09:30.900,0:09:52.320
Many Christians today are victims of the trap of unforgiveness.

0:09:52.320,0:09:59.980
Many of us have never felt the presence of God.

0:09:59.980,0:10:03.260
You just use an idea.

0:10:03.260,0:10:06.800
You don't know what it means to feel the presence of God.

0:10:06.800,0:10:09.120
How does He see people?

0:10:09.120,0:10:11.900
Does He shake people like this?

0:10:11.900,0:10:13.940
How?

0:10:13.940,0:10:33.640
Many have never felt the presence of God due to years of holding unforgiveness.

0:10:33.640,0:10:37.220
Due to what?

0:10:37.220,0:10:38.980
Years of what?

0:10:38.980,0:10:43.240
... of holding unforgiveness.

0:10:43.240,0:10:55.860
You are holding grief, grudges, pain of the past, bitterness, resentment in your heart

0:10:55.860,0:11:01.740
and you are expecting to feel the presence of God.

0:11:01.740,0:11:06.580
I am just telling you the reason why you don't know who God is.

0:11:06.580,0:11:13.180
You only read that God is good, nice, He is Saviour,  Healer, Deliverer...

0:11:13.180,0:11:20.420
But to have Him - it is a different thing.

0:11:20.420,0:11:35.260
Many have never felt the presence of God due to years of holding unforgiveness.

0:11:35.260,0:11:45.640
Pain of the past, strife, claiming you are right;

0:11:45.640,0:11:55.440
you don’t know that unforgiving spirit will put you in the dark, outside God.

0:11:55.440,0:12:05.520
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold pain.

0:12:05.520,0:12:25.160
Unforgiveness because of relations, friends, people that died, or that are alive...

0:12:25.160,0:12:37.440
Holding unforgiveness towards dead, alive, relatives, friends

0:12:37.440,0:12:43.900
and you are expecting to feel the presence of God...

0:12:43.900,0:12:47.980
God is looking for a free spirit.

0:12:47.980,0:12:52.620
You are not free.

0:12:52.620,0:12:53.760
You are not available.

0:12:53.760,0:12:58.660
Tell your neighbour, "You are not free.
You are not available".

0:12:58.660,0:12:59.860
I cannot hear you.

0:12:59.860,0:13:02.360
[You are not free.
You are not available.]

0:13:02.360,0:13:03.400
I cannot hear you.

0:13:03.400,0:13:05.860
[You are not free.
You are not available.]

0:13:05.860,0:13:06.640
Again.

0:13:06.640,0:13:09.260
[You are not free.
You are not available.]

0:13:09.260,0:13:11.860
You are not free.
You are not available.

0:13:11.860,0:13:27.420
If you should go into your heart, a lot is there - there is a conflict between faith and doubt,

0:13:27.420,0:13:32.940
love and hatred, good and bad.

0:13:32.940,0:13:37.980
Conflicts are going on.

0:13:37.980,0:13:40.260
You are not free.

0:13:40.260,0:13:42.300
You have to settle your account.

0:13:42.300,0:13:47.860
You must have a free spirit to attract the Spirit of God.

0:13:47.860,0:13:49.860
You are not free.

0:13:49.860,0:13:57.300
That is why you have never felt the presence of God.

0:13:57.300,0:14:02.380

0:14:02.380,0:14:09.400
Someone may have done a horrible thing to you.

0:14:09.400,0:14:14.920
For you to receive God, you must forgive.

0:14:14.920,0:14:17.520
You must forgive.

0:14:17.520,0:14:26.440
Someone may have done horrible things to offend you.

0:14:26.440,0:14:34.700
For you to receive God, you must forgive.

0:14:34.700,0:14:39.380
The question: How will I forgive?

0:14:39.380,0:14:51.980
You must first learn to forgive yourself.

0:14:51.980,0:14:57.820
Then, you can forgive others.

0:14:57.820,0:15:00.820
What you don’t have, you cannot give.

0:15:00.820,0:15:05.500
You can only give out what you have and you cannot give all you have.

0:15:05.500,0:15:10.980
Forgive yourself; then, forgive others.

0:15:10.980,0:15:21.880
Because everybody hurts somewhere.

0:15:21.880,0:15:30.680
Tell your neighbour, "Everybody hurts somewhere."

0:15:30.680,0:15:34.360
You must give them another chance.

0:15:34.360,0:15:37.800

Everybody hurts somewhere.

0:15:42.420,0:15:47.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:47.820,0:15:52.640
You must give them another chance.

0:15:52.640,0:15:58.360
Because you are given another chance, that is why you are here today.

0:15:58.360,0:16:05.840
You are given another chance; that is why you are able to sit, talk and laugh freely.

0:16:05.840,0:16:10.780
There are many people who, right now, cannot walk freely.

0:16:10.780,0:16:15.260
They want to be here but could not.

0:16:15.260,0:16:21.080
You walk, talk, sit and hear, freely.

0:16:21.080,0:16:24.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:24.600,0:16:35.580
Many who are better than you, who live right better than you, are in the graveyard.

0:16:35.580,0:16:37.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:37.920,0:16:46.520
In terms of "living right", when we compare them to you, and you say you live right and you are an obedient child,

0:16:46.520,0:16:52.040
they are more obedient than you - but yet they are at the graveyard.

0:16:52.040,0:16:56.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:56.940,0:17:03.120
Their dream hit the rock of disappointment.

0:17:03.120,0:17:10.680
Here you are

0:17:10.680,0:17:15.560
looking freely, sitting freely, talking freely.

0:17:15.560,0:17:19.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:19.640,0:17:21.440
Give them another chance.

0:17:21.440,0:17:22.180
Tell your neighbour.

0:17:22.180,0:17:24.400
[Give them another chance.]

0:17:24.400,0:17:29.060
Your accusers – give them another chance.

0:17:29.060,0:17:30.140
I cannot hear you.

0:17:30.140,0:17:32.160
Give them another chance.

0:17:32.160,0:17:40.720
Your offenders – give them another chance.

0:17:40.720,0:17:47.400
Your enemies – give them another chance.

0:17:47.400,0:17:58.480
Jesus never disconnected from those who had made mistakes with their lives.

0:17:58.480,0:18:03.120
Give them another chance.

0:18:03.120,0:18:07.820
Don’t forget where we are coming from.

0:18:07.820,0:18:11.820
You don’t give; you don’t get.

0:18:11.820,0:18:15.240
What you give is what you get.

0:18:15.240,0:18:25.480
If you give useless things – what you do not need, you will continue to receive what you don’t need.

0:18:25.480,0:18:32.580
You have been giving your waste time, time you don't need.

0:18:32.580,0:18:42.860
When you want to visit your friends, you make sure you have no other commitments before going there.

0:18:42.860,0:18:52.660
You only want to pray when you are in need of God.

0:18:52.660,0:18:55.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:55.100,0:19:04.040
Sunday service - your government made it possible for you to be free so that you can come.

0:19:04.040,0:19:09.580
It is like you have been encouraged to worship God.

0:19:09.580,0:19:14.020
You should stop to be encouraged to worship God, you should worship God.

0:19:14.020,0:19:19.360
Tell your neighbour, "Stop being encouraged - worship God".

0:19:19.360,0:19:26.380
You have been encouraged to worship God, that is why they have given you a day for worship - Sunday.

0:19:26.380,0:19:31.120
Your government, your authority is encouraging you to worship God,

0:19:31.120,0:19:36.660
that is why you are given a free day to come to church.

0:19:36.660,0:19:39.300
That should not be the salvation of your soul.

0:19:39.300,0:19:46.400
The salvation of your soul – you should worship God with all your heart, with all your soul.

0:19:46.400,0:19:49.540

0:19:49.540,0:19:59.580
After today you will not worship or read your Bible until next Sunday.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:02.320,0:20:10.340
The way you have been giving to God is the way you have been receiving from Him.

0:20:10.340,0:20:14.980
There are many areas in the Bible you have never read in your life.

0:20:14.980,0:20:21.160
You only look for a healing and blessing portion - psalm 35.

0:20:21.160,0:20:23.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:23.980,0:20:26.820
What you give is what you get.

0:20:26.820,0:20:31.180
So, forgiveness – what you give is what you get.

0:20:31.180,0:20:35.180
“I forgive you” – do you really mean it with all your heart?

0:20:35.180,0:20:37.140
"I forgive you."

0:20:37.140,0:20:44.620
Do you really mean it with all your heart or you say this for selfish, classic and material reasons?

0:20:44.620,0:20:48.820
What you give is what you get.

0:20:48.820,0:20:53.040
Look at your dress, how you look like.

0:20:53.040,0:21:04.340
You have a special dress somewhere, which you normally wear for festivals, special occasions,

0:21:04.340,0:21:06.420
weddings...

0:21:06.420,0:21:12.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:12.040,0:21:20.780
When it is time for thanksgiving, you bring change you received at the petrol station.

0:21:20.780,0:21:23.020
What you give is what you get.

0:21:23.020,0:21:26.180
You give change; you receive change.

0:21:26.180,0:21:29.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:29.980,0:21:32.380
Forgiveness.

0:21:32.380,0:21:38.120
You give change you received somewhere and you will receive change in return.

0:21:38.120,0:21:44.680
This is why what you have been receiving has not been satisfying you.

0:21:44.680,0:21:49.440
What you give to your friend is what you get from your friend.

0:21:49.440,0:21:52.360
What you give to your wife is what you get from your wife.

0:21:52.360,0:21:56.920
What you give to your husband is what you get from your husband.

0:21:56.920,0:22:02.920
What you give to your God is what you get from your God.

0:22:02.920,0:22:08.400
When we talk of giving, I am talking of forgiveness.

0:22:08.400,0:22:16.540
I’m talking of material and immaterial needs.

0:22:16.540,0:22:19.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:19.740,0:22:22.740
Your time

0:22:22.740,0:22:28.440
When you give time that you don't need for an occasion.

0:22:28.440,0:22:31.200
When you study, the reward of that occasion...
