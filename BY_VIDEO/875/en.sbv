Viewers all over the world, I want to say thank you for your time; God’s time is the best.

0:00:07.900,0:00:11.800
This is God’s time, thank you.

0:00:11.800,0:00:19.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:19.340,0:00:21.440
Hallelujah.

0:00:21.440,0:00:30.140
While I listen to some of the confessions... the Bible has said it already - this child is destined

0:00:30.140,0:00:41.980
to cause the rise and falling of many; to cause the rise of many who appreciate Him,

0:00:41.980,0:00:48.680
who know Him as a Prophet,

0:00:48.680,0:00:54.080
but the falling of those who what?

0:00:54.240,0:00:57.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:57.080,0:00:59.480
God has been fighting for me right from the beginning.

0:00:59.480,0:01:03.380
This is why you will not hear anything from me.

0:01:03.380,0:01:06.400
If you slap me I will just say "OK, thank you".

0:01:06.400,0:01:10.220
I know God will fight for me.

0:01:10.220,0:01:12.820
You don't fight for God.

0:01:12.820,0:01:14.760
Leave the battle for God.

0:01:14.760,0:01:18.160
What you say about me, about the ministry...

0:01:18.160,0:01:23.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:23.980,0:01:26.380
It is all about Jesus.

0:01:26.380,0:01:35.800
Since it is all about Jesus, it is not about me, my effort, my knowledge, my gifts - it is all about Jesus.

0:01:35.800,0:01:37.840
He had been fighting for me.

0:01:37.840,0:01:38.920
This is it.

0:01:38.920,0:01:42.980
It is a pity that a lot might have been deceived.

0:01:42.980,0:01:48.720
Many of us here cry when they see the healing going on.

0:01:48.720,0:01:53.380
You ask them, "Why are you crying? People are receiving healing and you are crying

0:01:53.380,0:01:55.960
instead of jumping and thanking God"

0:01:55.960,0:02:06.180
You hear from them that, "I wanted to bring my mammy here. I was deceived and this woman is late now".

0:02:06.180,0:02:10.300
You hear different stories just like that.

0:02:10.300,0:02:15.500
You just leave your battle for God but it may be very difficult.

0:02:15.500,0:02:22.280
You know - at the beginning of the ministry it was so bad - the image out there,

0:02:22.280,0:02:25.580
but we just leave the battle for God.

0:02:25.580,0:02:31.200
At the beginning, it will be very tough but as time goes on,

0:02:31.200,0:02:36.840
at the midway, you will begin to see fruit of your labour.

0:02:36.840,0:02:40.280
It’s sweet to leave your battle for God.

0:02:40.280,0:02:47.820
Tell your neighbour, "It’s very sweet to leave your battle for God."

0:02:47.820,0:02:56.300
You just pray as if all depends on God and begin to work as if all depends on you.

0:02:56.300,0:03:00.580
Tell your neighbour.

0:03:00.580,0:03:14.860
Pray as if all depends on God but work very hard, as if all depends on you.

0:03:14.860,0:03:19.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:19.600,0:03:25.520
At the beginning it will look as if you are surrounded with dark clouds:

0:03:25.520,0:03:31.940
you will be doing good and people will be giving other name to it, saying that you are doing bad.

0:03:31.940,0:03:34.760
You smile: people say, “You are sad”.

0:03:34.760,0:03:38.580
You are happy; people say, “No, there is sorrow!”

0:03:38.580,0:03:42.520
They are very good in propaganda.

0:03:42.520,0:03:52.800
They have numerous people out there that are very good in propaganda, blackmail, name calling...

0:03:52.800,0:03:55.260
and they are trillions.

0:03:55.260,0:04:05.020
It is a professional business now to spoil peoples name.

0:04:05.020,0:04:13.820
It is a professional job going out to spoil your name, pay people money to destroy your career,

0:04:13.820,0:04:19.740
to "paint you black".

0:04:19.740,0:04:21.560
It is a professional job now.

0:04:21.560,0:04:27.660
In the past, it was not a professional job - you had to hire somebody to do this

0:04:27.660,0:04:31.900
but now it is a professional job.

0:04:31.900,0:04:35.100
Just leave the battle for God.

0:04:35.100,0:04:40.160
Thank God for the blessing God gave us – Emmanuel TV.

0:04:40.160,0:04:45.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:45.320,0:04:50.740
At the beginning, there was nothing like Emmanuel TV.

0:04:50.740,0:04:55.600
As God worked here, people would give it a different name there.

0:04:55.600,0:05:01.300
But right now, people see it live and direct.

0:05:01.300,0:05:05.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:05.240,0:05:08.920
As I am talking now, people are watching.

0:05:08.920,0:05:11.900
They just want to know if it is live.

0:05:11.900,0:05:17.680
If somebody tells you, "He said this." you can say, "No, this is what I heard."

0:05:17.680,0:05:20.060
This is the battle going on out there now.

0:05:20.060,0:05:24.680
The battle now is quite different from the battle in the past.

0:05:24.680,0:05:29.640
The battle in the past was, "He said, 'No'" - and they would take it.

0:05:29.640,0:05:32.680
But the present battle is:
- "He said 'No'"

0:05:32.680,0:05:39.240
People would answer:
- "'No', he said 'Yes'. I was there "

0:05:39.240,0:05:44.420
- "He said 'No'"
- "I was there"

0:05:44.420,0:05:48.820
It is the fight of Pharisees and Sadducees.

0:05:48.820,0:05:53.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:53.080,0:05:54.660
That is the argument now.

0:05:54.660,0:06:03.220
- "I was watching. I recorded it. I heard him saying 'No'"
-"'No'. He said 'Yes'"

0:06:03.220,0:06:07.060
- "No, it was 'No'" 
- "No, it was 'Yes'"

0:06:07.060,0:06:14.900
This battle is very hot, but they overcome it because it was recorded.

0:06:14.900,0:06:16.380
It is just like that.

0:06:16.380,0:06:19.700
I know how many of us here were greatly destroyed by it.

0:06:19.700,0:06:22.840
Don't give up.

0:06:22.840,0:06:23.820
[Amen.]

0:06:23.820,0:06:25.040
Tell your neighbour, "Don't give up".

0:06:25.040,0:06:26.040
[Don't give up.]

0:06:26.040,0:06:27.040
I cannot hear you.

0:06:27.040,0:06:28.540
[Don't give up.]

0:06:28.540,0:06:32.020
Hold on and keep fighting.

0:06:32.020,0:06:38.980
Tell your neighbour, "Don't give up; hold on and keep fighting."

0:06:38.980,0:06:41.960
That is a good fight.

0:06:41.960,0:06:45.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:45.620,0:06:50.440
You say they lie against you, this is very bad...

0:06:50.440,0:06:53.300
This is what they want.

0:06:53.300,0:07:04.060
Hold on and keep fighting the good fight and that is the beauty of our journey.

0:07:04.060,0:07:16.500
When you are going and something is there to push you back – that is the beauty of the journey.

0:07:16.500,0:07:23.140
That will make you value the journey and also make you value the achievement.

0:07:23.140,0:07:27.200
By the time you go through and thing about what you have gone through,

0:07:27.200,0:07:33.480
what you have encountered – it will make you value whatever you achieve.

0:07:33.480,0:07:44.900
When you sit down and think about what you have gone through to achieve what you have achieved...

0:07:44.900,0:07:54.820
... escaped death, escaped accident, blackmail, name calling; a lot.

0:07:54.820,0:07:57.700
At the end you are there.

0:07:57.700,0:08:06.020
You will gorgeously hold that victory and cherish it so much.

0:08:06.020,0:08:14.100
There are many people who think they have victory - you see them living a reckless life; clubhouse, smoking,

0:08:14.100,0:08:19.520
drinking, going out, when they are very rich.

0:08:19.520,0:08:23.560
Doubt that achievement.

0:08:23.560,0:08:33.280
That achievement is not going through the right processing.

0:08:33.280,0:08:43.260
The right processing means "good, bad - today it is good tomorrow it is bad".

0:08:43.260,0:08:58.180
If you go through all this processing to achieve this you will gorgeously cherish the victory.

0:08:58.180,0:09:06.760
You can see many marriages today - people say they would quit the marriage, that they are tired...

0:09:06.760,0:09:14.200
You ask yourself - maybe they are together because of the outward appearance or qualities?

0:09:14.200,0:09:26.500
Probably the lady saw the handsome man, the beauty, the money, fame, popularity -

0:09:26.500,0:09:31.600
maybe that's why they came here together as husband and wife.

0:09:31.600,0:09:35.780
Anything can break such marriage.

0:09:35.780,0:09:45.920
If outward quality is base of coming here together as husband and wife - forget - they will soon what?

0:09:45.920,0:09:47.560
Tell me.

0:09:47.560,0:09:51.220
They will soon separate.

0:09:51.220,0:10:03.040
But if their coming together is a result of something beyond human comprehension - from the heart,

0:10:03.040,0:10:05.720
the love from the heart...

0:10:05.720,0:10:10.600
You have decided - nothing can break.

0:10:10.600,0:10:14.800
The Lord have brought you together - only Him that can what?

0:10:14.800,0:10:17.040
Separate you.

0:10:17.040,0:10:24.780
Not a situation, not name calling, not someone coming and saying, "Your husband is a criminal.

0:10:24.780,0:10:28.000
Don't you know? This is a picture. We caught him."

0:10:28.000,0:10:30.880
You say, "No, I'm not interested in the marriage."

0:10:30.880,0:10:36.120
Situation will never break a marriage that God brought together.

0:10:36.120,0:10:41.920
Challenges will never break a marriage that God brought together.

0:10:41.920,0:10:47.160
Trouble will never break a marriage the Lord brought together.

0:10:47.160,0:10:48.160
It is not possible.

0:10:48.160,0:10:51.640
Even death...

0:10:51.640,0:10:59.560
If death comes it cannot separate that marriage.

0:10:59.560,0:11:01.860
Can't you hear what Paul said?

0:11:01.860,0:11:05.380
What can separate me from the love of God?

0:11:05.380,0:11:11.480
Every love of a Christian is love of God.

0:11:11.480,0:11:23.680
Because our love sees beyond hatred, trouble, challenges, and condition – beyond.

0:11:23.680,0:11:30.640
If trouble comes and you have the love of Christ, that love will still stand.

0:11:30.640,0:11:35.660
Trouble will not cause to say, "No, I don't love you any more because you are a criminal."

0:11:35.660,0:11:37.680
No, that is not a love of God.

0:11:37.680,0:11:41.720
Only God, the Father of love...

0:11:41.720,0:11:42.720
This is it.

0:11:42.720,0:11:49.720
This is why you keep going around.

0:11:49.720,0:11:58.540
Someone from whom you separated some years ago is your friend today.

0:11:58.540,0:12:05.620
If you knew that this man would be your saviour, you would not want to separate from him.

0:12:05.620,0:12:12.700
But because you have selfish, material, classic love for people...

0:12:12.700,0:12:14.980
Look at politics today.

0:12:14.980,0:12:22.340
Everywhere, all over the world, Africa, western world, America - all over.

0:12:22.340,0:12:27.280
We have seen a man accusing the candidate of being a criminal,

0:12:27.280,0:12:34.860
but when the candidate wins the election, the accuser is the one who wants to be the minister of external affairs.

0:12:34.860,0:12:40.520
Love of God is the answer to your problem.

0:12:40.520,0:12:44.680
Just love and see whether or not you will be healed.

0:12:44.680,0:12:48.200
Just love and see whether or not you will be delivered.

0:12:48.200,0:12:55.740
You just need love of God; is sees beyond hatred.

0:12:55.740,0:12:59.480
If I express the love of God to you,

0:12:59.480,0:13:05.900
I will never separate from you because of trouble, unless God says separate.

0:13:05.900,0:13:11.120
No matter the trouble, trouble will not make me to quit from that love.

0:13:11.120,0:13:19.440
Because if you have a trouble with me and I quit; what about tomorrow - if you are there the one to help me?

0:13:19.440,0:13:20.300
What would I do?

0:13:20.300,0:13:22.200
I would still come back to you.

0:13:22.200,0:13:24.740
This is what is happening today.

0:13:24.740,0:13:30.080
People you see as enemies today seem to be your saviours tomorrow.

0:13:30.080,0:13:33.980
People keep going back to their former friends.

0:13:33.980,0:13:39.940
Your formal political or business friends...

0:13:39.940,0:13:49.840
Even in the marriage; people who quitted the marriage - they begin to go back and re-marry.

0:13:49.840,0:13:52.760
As for me - I don't know what you are talking about.

0:13:52.760,0:13:55.020
You say somebody is bad...

0:13:55.020,0:13:59.240
Unless God says the person is bad...

0:13:59.240,0:14:06.760
God can use any foolish thing to humble anyone.

0:14:06.760,0:14:09.600
What you say - very arrogant...

0:14:09.600,0:14:16.140
You just find yourself stealing a property.

0:14:16.140,0:14:19.660
By the time you finish stealing the property you ask yourself,

0:14:19.660,0:14:23.000
"What pushed me to do this? I have a lot of money. Why should I steal?"

0:14:23.000,0:14:27.720
But something has to humble you.

0:14:27.720,0:14:30.240
It may be sickness...

0:14:30.240,0:14:35.040
When you become so arrogant, that sickness will just come.

0:14:35.040,0:14:38.640
What you didn't notice before - you will start to see.

0:14:38.640,0:14:39.920
It is to humble you.

0:14:39.920,0:14:42.640
After you are humbled the sickness is gone.

0:14:42.640,0:14:46.920
Look at what happened to many of you to humble you.

0:14:46.920,0:14:51.700
You, who used to count money, you become a beggar now.

0:14:51.700,0:14:55.680
Somebody you would never greet is your saviour now.

0:14:55.680,0:15:00.800
A lot of things had humbled you.

0:15:00.800,0:15:06.280
Many of you say that you would never come to the Synagogue but you sit in the front now.

0:15:06.280,0:15:11.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:11.760,0:15:16.320
And you even ask to record your face.

0:15:16.320,0:15:21.300
When we start dancing, some people would be doing...

0:15:21.300,0:15:24.980
They want their people to see them at home, that they are here.

0:15:24.980,0:15:29.260
And those are people who used to say, "Over my dead body."

0:15:29.260,0:15:30.480
Can you see?

0:15:30.480,0:15:35.740
We keep eating what we have vomited, like a dog.

0:15:35.740,0:15:37.040
We know dog.

0:15:37.040,0:15:41.520
When dog vomits it will never eat that.

0:15:41.520,0:15:45.040
But we vomit and we eat what we vomit.

0:15:45.040,0:15:46.260
This is life.

0:15:46.260,0:15:52.800
In our business, you go to places to which you said you would never go.

0:15:52.800,0:15:58.140
A man you said you would never talk to - now he is in the position to help you - you go there.

0:15:58.140,0:16:02.540
You vomit and you eat your vomit.

0:16:02.540,0:16:07.460
This is just life - very embarrassing.

0:16:07.460,0:16:11.020
I know this right from the beginning of my life.

0:16:11.020,0:16:18.940
When you curse, abuse or lie against me - I will not talk.

0:16:18.940,0:16:29.720
I will be looking because I'm afraid that you that hate me now, you may be my saviour tomorrow.

0:16:29.720,0:16:35.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:35.320,0:16:38.780
When people start to say, "T.B. Joshua is a devil"...

0:16:38.780,0:16:43.240
All sorts of things, you lie against me, whatever you do - I will not talk.

0:16:43.240,0:16:45.480
I will be looking at tomorrow.

0:16:45.480,0:16:47.500
Not now.

0:16:47.500,0:17:03.620
The fear I have is; if you are very bad now, you may be the best man tomorrow.

0:17:03.620,0:17:12.500
If I now begin to wrestle and fight with you beyond repair and you are there to help me tomorrow -

0:17:12.500,0:17:15.740
how will I approach you?

0:17:15.740,0:17:19.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:19.760,0:17:29.660
You - you have done a lot fighting your enemy, those who fight you, trying to do all sort of things...

0:17:29.660,0:17:33.360
People insult you, you insult them.

0:17:33.360,0:17:37.040
You take them to the court, you sentence them to the prison.

0:17:37.040,0:17:41.220
Many husbands of those who are here are in the prison.

0:17:41.220,0:17:45.200
Many wives of those who are here are in the prison.

0:17:45.200,0:17:50.000
Many house mates of those who are here are imprisoned.

0:17:50.000,0:17:57.260
Many of those in here today have imprisoned their staff working with them.

0:17:57.260,0:18:02.060
If you look back at what you have done...

0:18:02.060,0:18:05.500
Many have imprisoned their saviours tomorrow.

0:18:05.500,0:18:11.500
Tell your neighbour, "Many have imprisoned their saviours tomorrow -

0:18:11.500,0:18:14.220
because of wrong."

0:18:14.220,0:18:20.900
Because of wrong the person has done now, they have imprisoned their saviour.

0:18:20.900,0:18:28.860
The person you imprisoned is your saviour tomorrow, and he is in the prison.

0:18:28.860,0:18:35.200
Check yourself, your staff - what they have done is bad - we agree.

0:18:35.200,0:18:45.560
They might have committed crimes; stealing, destruction in your company, but you sentenced them to death,

0:18:45.560,0:18:49.800
or prison - some even to death.

0:18:49.800,0:18:55.800
But these are the people God wants to use as the saviour for you tomorrow,

0:18:55.800,0:19:01.640
no matter how bad the person is now.

0:19:01.640,0:19:10.780
Tomorrow is something you don't understand, a mystery you don't understand.

0:19:10.780,0:19:19.580
But because you claim your right, "Oh no, this man insulted me, embarrassed me, stole my property" -

0:19:19.580,0:19:22.600
you sentence him to prison.

0:19:22.600,0:19:27.060
The same man is your saviour tomorrow.

0:19:27.060,0:19:30.300
You will miss a saviour tomorrow, but he is there.

0:19:30.300,0:19:34.420
It could be a saviour to your children tomorrow.

0:19:34.420,0:19:43.240
This is why the Bible says, “Forgive those who have trespassed against us…”

0:19:43.240,0:19:45.760
You want to say, "Father, forgive me".

0:19:45.760,0:19:50.920
Have you forgiven those who have wronged you?

0:19:50.920,0:19:53.400
You say, "Forgive us, as we forgive those who have what"?

0:19:53.400,0:19:54.620
[Wronged us.]

0:19:54.620,0:19:57.980
This is what is meant.

0:19:57.980,0:20:02.020
Father, forgive us, as we forgive those who have...

0:20:02.020,0:20:05.520
The condition is: you have to forgive them before He can forgive you.

0:20:05.520,0:20:10.220
The condition is: these people that are wrong today...

0:20:10.220,0:20:13.260
Even the Bible in the book of Galatians said it:

0:20:13.260,0:20:19.940
if you have caught someone in act of sin or mistake...

0:20:19.940,0:20:29.980
You caught somebody stealing - it says that you should restore that person gently.

0:20:29.980,0:20:38.880
To restore somebody back is to counsel the person, to talk to the person, not to judge the person.

0:20:38.880,0:20:44.080
Because if you judge, who will judge you on the last day?

0:20:44.080,0:20:47.940
If there is anything I fear most...

0:20:47.940,0:20:50.540
If they ask, "T.B. Joshua, what do you fear a lot?"

0:20:50.540,0:20:53.560
Tomorrow.

0:20:53.560,0:20:58.360
When I say tomorrow I mean "next".

0:20:58.360,0:21:02.220
While I am turning I am facing tomorrow.

0:21:02.220,0:21:04.280
This is what I mean.

0:21:04.280,0:21:05.240
I fear.

0:21:05.240,0:21:08.300
I do not fear of what I am looking at now.

0:21:08.300,0:21:12.120
I fear what I will see next.

0:21:12.120,0:21:18.900
You own now, but God owns our future.

0:21:18.900,0:21:24.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:24.520,0:21:32.400
You can say to God, "Please, leave me".

0:21:32.400,0:21:39.160
But "next" is there for you to judge the action you display now.

0:21:39.160,0:21:50.500
Now, if you see Jesus, you can slap Him, but "next" is there to judge you.

0:21:50.500,0:21:54.300
If there is anything I fear - it is "next".

0:21:54.300,0:21:57.740
I will not use the word "future", I will say "next".

0:21:57.740,0:22:01.440
If there is anything I fear – next.

0:22:01.440,0:22:02.640
Tell your neighbour.

0:22:02.640,0:22:06.820
[If there is anything I fear – next.]

0:22:06.820,0:22:09.740
I fear the "next".

0:22:09.740,0:22:14.680
OK, you - I know no fear, but next...

0:22:14.680,0:22:17.340
Because of this fear - if you hit me I will just be silent.

0:22:17.340,0:22:25.480
Because I don't know; if you are the worst now, maybe you will be there in the future for me.

0:22:25.480,0:22:26.480
I have sinned.

0:22:26.480,0:22:35.380
Look at Paul, look at Saul...

0:22:35.380,0:22:42.440
You have seen your servant in the office; later he becomes a leader.

0:22:42.440,0:22:55.180
You have seen someone coming from your village, you received him, housed him, clothed him, took care of him,

0:22:55.180,0:23:00.680
and then, before you know it, he becomes a MD of the company,

0:23:00.680,0:23:05.440
someone to whom your children run for help.

0:23:05.440,0:23:12.900
A little boy or girl who came from the village, and you were there as a father in the city - you receive him

0:23:12.900,0:23:14.700
because he is your family.

0:23:14.700,0:23:17.260
You ask him where he wants to live.

0:23:17.260,0:23:25.040
You begin to use him as your house-mate or house-boy, gardener or whatever...

0:23:25.040,0:23:29.120
Before you know it he enters school.

0:23:29.120,0:23:39.040
While the time passes, before you know it, he becomes a leader, governor, president...

0:23:39.040,0:23:43.480
Now, he is there to help you and your family.

0:23:43.480,0:23:52.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:52.000,0:24:01.680
Now, you begin to complain; "Go and meet him. I hosted him when he came to Lagos from the village.

0:24:01.680,0:24:06.020
I clothed him, I sent him to school. Go and meet him."

0:24:06.020,0:24:16.320
Now, you become a prayer warrior, you pray; "God, this boy - Peter, I hosted him, I received him, I clothed him,

0:24:16.320,0:24:24.900
I sent him to school. He is now a millionaire. God, I'm going to meet him now in his office. Whatever I say -

0:24:24.900,0:24:29.480
God, enter his heart."

0:24:29.480,0:24:35.840
God should enter his heart - when I speak he should listen. I need one million dollars.

0:24:35.840,0:24:40.960
He should just sign a cheque for me.

0:24:40.960,0:24:43.700
You fast before going there.

0:24:43.700,0:24:48.260
You move towards the office, you are about to enter the office...

0:24:48.260,0:24:55.080
You know, before meeting a MD or leader there is a protocol to follow.

0:24:55.080,0:25:00.340
First, the security will ask you to sit down.

0:25:00.340,0:25:03.920
While you sit you start talking to the security agent:
- "How are you?"

0:25:03.920,0:25:04.520
- "Fine"

0:25:04.520,0:25:12.620
- "It is my son. When he came from the village I was the one who...

0:25:12.620,0:25:18.780
... I was the one who hosted him in the 90s..."

0:25:18.780,0:25:22.440
And the security agent is surprised, "You hosted him?"

0:25:22.440,0:25:32.840
If you have some wonderful pictures when he was very small, you show them explaining,

0:25:32.840,0:25:38.620
"This is him, this is me."

0:25:38.620,0:25:39.900
It is true.

0:25:39.900,0:25:45.060
The agent would haste to inform others.

0:25:45.060,0:25:53.180
He informs senior security officers, "Close family member wants to see the governor".

0:25:53.180,0:26:00.880
They will inform the senior adviser to the governor - because they work by directives.

0:26:00.880,0:26:07.140
The adviser would react, "Please! What is your name? You are sacked. What family member?"

0:26:07.140,0:26:11.420
We are talking of protocol - do you imagine bringing somebody from the village?

0:26:11.420,0:26:14.840
Would this person be able to see the governor?

0:26:14.840,0:26:16.880
These are the stories.

0:26:16.880,0:26:19.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:19.720,0:26:21.200
Fear next.

0:26:21.200,0:26:22.260
Tell your neighbour.

0:26:22.260,0:26:23.360
[Fear next.]

0:26:23.360,0:26:24.500
I cannot hear you.

0:26:24.500,0:26:25.860
[Fear next.]

0:26:25.860,0:26:31.020
If you don't fear next you will finish telling stories.

0:26:31.020,0:26:38.900
Tell your neighbour, "If you don't fear next you will end up telling stories."

0:26:38.900,0:26:42.540
If some people, they are telling stories...

0:26:42.540,0:26:49.040
Many of us here have time to tell stories of the president, the secretary general,

0:26:49.040,0:26:57.560
how you started schooling and he was junior to you, how you used to help him, how you were the first student,

0:26:57.560,0:27:00.660
how you were senior...

0:27:00.660,0:27:02.440
People would be listening.

0:27:02.440,0:27:10.080
By the time you finish they would...

0:27:10.080,0:27:13.100
I don't want to tell stories.

0:27:13.100,0:27:17.160
I fear next.

0:27:17.160,0:27:22.620
When I see a little boy coming my way, I don't want to know his background.

0:27:22.620,0:27:29.940
Whether he is rich or poor... because God is always on the side of those poor.

0:27:29.940,0:27:36.720
God is always on the side of those who have nothing.

0:27:36.720,0:27:43.340
Those little children when I see them - I am always careful.

0:27:43.340,0:27:52.660
I need to tell you people why I am always careful about the next.

0:27:52.660,0:28:02.420
Do you know that Jesus can come as a person to test your faith, to see how strong you are?

0:28:02.420,0:28:05.140
It could happen even here in the church.

0:28:05.140,0:28:12.560
He would just come and put on the rug, the kind of thing you don't expect people to wear coming to the church.

0:28:12.560,0:28:15.740
He would start His test from the security.

0:28:15.740,0:28:20.560
"Please, help me. I want to worship."

0:28:20.560,0:28:34.240
If security agents are not in the Spirit, they would say, "Please! Before I open my eyes... Find your way!"

0:28:34.240,0:28:36.660
And we are here for Jesus.

0:28:36.660,0:28:41.900
The same Jesus we are here for, is the same we are chasing out.

0:28:41.900,0:28:45.800
What next to come?

0:28:45.800,0:28:49.360
If you chase away Jesus, what next?

0:28:49.360,0:28:51.440
Many of us...

0:28:51.440,0:28:56.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:56.200,0:28:59.460
You are in the posh car, driving...

0:28:59.460,0:29:06.780
Somebody would just come and said, "Please, I have not eaten since morning. Help me."

0:29:06.780,0:29:09.060
You look at the person...

0:29:09.060,0:29:15.320
You don't know that the Saviour you are calling is the one that is asking you for help.

0:29:15.320,0:29:20.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:20.080,0:29:22.600
You don't know.

0:29:22.600,0:29:30.780
You will say, "How the Saviour of the world could come just like that?" No!

0:29:30.780,0:29:33.020
He has no beginning, He has no end.

0:29:33.020,0:29:42.460
After the prayer and any other thing we are here for, there is a time to test your faith.

0:29:42.460,0:29:52.280
This test will make 90% of the mark, and what is here will make only 10% of the mark.

0:29:52.280,0:29:53.220
That is why...

0:29:53.220,0:29:59.140
Whatever we receive needs to be examined by tests.

0:29:59.140,0:30:02.020
Just after leaving here it is a time to test your faith.

0:30:02.020,0:30:04.460
Time of tests starts even here.

0:30:04.460,0:30:08.100
That is the beauty.

0:30:08.100,0:30:13.440
Nothing comes for nothing; nothing comes by chance.

0:30:13.440,0:30:18.700
You should be ready for tests that will test your faith.

0:30:18.700,0:30:21.120
Do you mean what you are saying?

0:30:21.120,0:30:23.940
Do you mean what you are doing?

0:30:23.940,0:30:26.040
Do you mean what you confess?

0:30:26.040,0:30:32.380
"Lord Jesus, I am a sinner, come in to my live, enter my soul, wash me with your precious blood..."

0:30:32.380,0:30:36.920
Do you actually mean it?

0:30:36.920,0:30:43.740
A test will confirm whether you mean what you are confessing.

0:30:43.740,0:30:49.960
Look at the gentleman here; he came with walking sticks for healing.

0:30:49.960,0:30:51.960
I don't know where he is coming from.

0:30:51.960,0:30:56.680
He has passed through many churches, but he is here.

0:30:56.680,0:31:00.100
The question I used to ask myself, "Why here?"

0:31:00.100,0:31:03.300
This is to test my faith.

0:31:03.300,0:31:09.740
Not that I'm superior or better than any other person but he came to test my faith.

0:31:09.740,0:31:14.880
For my faith to be tested - I need to be very just.

0:31:14.880,0:31:19.120
To be just is to do what Christ wants us to do.

0:31:19.120,0:31:25.140
Prayer - we are given this grace to pray freely and you are to pray for him freely.

0:31:25.140,0:31:30.500
And you have to thank him, greet him, and give him a kiss.

0:31:30.500,0:31:40.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:40.600,0:31:45.620
Pray for him, ask him if he is OK, call the evangelist to take care of him.

0:31:45.620,0:31:46.880
If you need money...

0:31:46.880,0:31:49.280
Maybe he has spent all his money.

0:31:49.280,0:31:50.760
Now, he is here.

0:31:50.760,0:31:58.140
If you don't help him financially he may return to the world and whatever you have done for him is a waste.

0:31:58.140,0:32:05.840
It is somebody who had spent all his money on this sickness and is here.

0:32:05.840,0:32:07.720
And now he is cured.

0:32:07.720,0:32:12.300
Now, he needs to eat, to go home, and he becomes a beggar again.

0:32:12.300,0:32:14.060
This is another temptation.

0:32:14.060,0:32:17.400
That could lead him to loosing his miracle.

0:32:17.400,0:32:21.000
So, please - ask him if he needs transport.

0:32:21.000,0:32:23.820
Let him come again tomorrow, let us intervene.

0:32:23.820,0:32:27.600
He has to keep fighting a good fight.

0:32:27.600,0:32:30.560
We need to do whatever he needs to support him.

0:32:30.560,0:32:32.100
He should not be giving us money.

0:32:32.100,0:32:35.800
Him giving his money being sick, he is giving us his own sickness.

0:32:35.800,0:32:38.920
And I don't want sickness.

0:32:38.920,0:32:44.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:44.480,0:33:00.560
If this man has money and you tell him to pay 100 000 Naira - he will give you immediately

0:33:00.560,0:33:03.560
but that money is not from his heart.

0:33:03.560,0:33:08.580
He is giving you on condition: "Heal me - receive money".

0:33:08.580,0:33:11.540
This is an exchange of the sickness.

0:33:11.540,0:33:17.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:17.840,0:33:23.320
He will bring it but it is not from his heart.

0:33:23.320,0:33:25.740
That is not an offering.

0:33:25.740,0:33:29.880
He would give me on condition that he would be healed.

0:33:29.880,0:33:34.120
It is like exchanging sickness with money.

0:33:34.120,0:33:38.240
He will give the money and the sickness.

0:33:38.240,0:33:47.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:47.360,0:33:53.160
You know the reason why I will not collect money directly from you - that is my principle.

0:33:53.160,0:33:55.520
I will not collect anything directly from you.

0:33:55.520,0:33:59.420
If you want to give just drop it in the box or anywhere.

0:33:59.420,0:34:04.300
And I don't want to hear what you gave.

0:34:04.300,0:34:07.020
You give to God.

0:34:07.020,0:34:15.280
These evil people - they like rewards, honor, to hear "thank you".

0:34:15.280,0:34:18.660
They want to be noticed and known.

0:34:18.660,0:34:30.720
If you don't give them that chance to be introduced to the general overseer, they will not give.

0:34:30.720,0:34:34.940
Their reward is to be noticed and known.

0:34:34.940,0:34:37.560
Their reward is not the Kingdom of God.

0:34:37.560,0:34:40.900
They don't know where they go.

0:34:40.900,0:34:49.480
Their reward is in this world - to be noticed, honoured, and respected.

0:34:49.480,0:34:53.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:53.900,0:35:02.860
There is a way we can eradicate corruption in the places of worship, in the church.

0:35:02.860,0:35:06.960
It is easy to eradicate this.

0:35:06.960,0:35:11.480
General overseer does not have any links with people that want to give money.

0:35:11.480,0:35:15.860
He doesn't even know them, or allow anyone to mention about it.

0:35:15.860,0:35:18.760
... they will not give you.

0:35:18.760,0:35:23.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:23.580,0:35:26.140
Yes, they will not give you.

0:35:26.140,0:35:34.880
If my money comes from corruption, killing, stealing or destruction - the person I will give it to must honor me.

0:35:34.880,0:35:37.600
This is my reward because God will not honor me.

0:35:37.600,0:35:43.360
If God will not honor me, you, whom I give to, should honor me and respect my position.

0:35:43.360,0:35:52.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:52.480,0:35:59.720
But you, whom God inspired to give...

0:35:59.720,0:36:07.440
... you will not even want man of God to know about it.

0:36:07.440,0:36:13.620
If God inspired you to give, you would not want man of God to know this.

0:36:13.620,0:36:17.020
Because you will not want to hear "thank you" from him.

0:36:17.020,0:36:21.400
That "thank you" from the man of God will affect the blessing of God.

0:36:21.400,0:36:23.300
[Amen]

0:36:23.300,0:36:27.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:27.360,0:36:31.400
God is the Rewarder.

0:36:31.400,0:36:35.700
He rewards man of God himself, He rewards you.

0:36:35.700,0:36:43.400
So, the reward of man of God is meaningless if truly God inspired you.

0:36:43.400,0:36:50.560
This is the reason why it is difficult for you to see me "one on one".

0:36:50.560,0:36:54.740
I always pray to know what a person wants to see me for.

0:36:54.740,0:36:59.760
Does this person want to give me money, or a gift?

0:36:59.760,0:37:06.880
I try to see what this person wants to give me.

0:37:06.880,0:37:10.900
If you give me and I reject it - you will not like it.

0:37:10.900,0:37:16.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:16.440,0:37:19.420
Where are we going?

0:37:19.420,0:37:25.780
The way out for you is so simple and you are destined to be great.

0:37:25.780,0:37:28.020
No, I'm telling you.

0:37:28.020,0:37:32.800
It is that greatness that is pushing you up and down, "Go this way".

0:37:32.800,0:37:36.300
If you were not destined to be great you would not come here.

0:37:36.300,0:37:38.540
But you have not achieved that greatness.

0:37:38.540,0:37:43.200
Something is telling you that you are a head and not tail.

0:37:43.200,0:37:50.540
If you are not a head yet - that is why you are here.

0:37:50.540,0:37:56.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:56.120,0:38:02.600
There are many of you – God just wants you to know what is to suffer

0:38:02.600,0:38:05.280
because He wants to take you high.

0:38:05.280,0:38:09.420
If you know what it means to suffer and you achieve that greatness,

0:38:09.420,0:38:12.060
you will take care of those who are suffering.

0:38:12.060,0:38:17.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:38:17.420,0:38:26.420
The greatest challenge in the world we are facing today is simple.

0:38:26.420,0:38:34.380
99% of those who occupy exalted positions, who are rich, famous all over the world -

0:38:34.380,0:38:37.320
they don't know what it means to suffer.

0:38:37.320,0:38:41.380
That is why they cannot take care of those who are suffering.

0:38:41.380,0:38:46.640
It is a disaster.

0:38:46.640,0:38:58.300
I think it is the reason why it is so difficult now to reach the position of honor, fame, exaltation...

0:38:58.300,0:39:07.360
The Lord knows that people need to know what does it mean to sleep in the dark,

0:39:07.360,0:39:27.180
to be sick, to be at the point of death, to face hardship, to be lonely, to be called names, to be in prison

0:39:27.180,0:39:34.120
to go through tribulation, before you achieve the position of honor.

0:39:34.120,0:39:42.020
If you are there and you experienced sickness, poverty, imprisonment, to be lied against -

0:39:42.020,0:39:46.600
and you are in the position of honor you want to take care, you want to help people, because you remember

0:39:46.600,0:39:57.360
being in the same position.

0:39:57.360,0:40:05.500
When you see somebody suffering, and you have so many, you are in the high position

0:40:05.500,0:40:07.980
and you have gone through it - you would say, "Oh my God".

0:40:07.980,0:40:11.940
You would be crying everyday, you would want to help.

0:40:11.940,0:40:19.020
Even the governor, minister, president - they should visit prisoners at least once in a month.

0:40:19.020,0:40:26.540
There are many people who are there being held innocent.

0:40:26.540,0:40:30.620
And they have been sentenced for a life in a prison.

0:40:30.620,0:40:43.900
People put stories together and they imprison the innocent for life.

0:40:43.900,0:40:45.940
They lie against them.

0:40:45.940,0:40:54.680
You, as a governor, visit the prison and ask them to give you a table there and you tell them that

0:40:54.680,0:40:58.640
you want to see the people that have been sentenced for life in prison.

0:40:58.640,0:41:02.860
Even if there are hundred of them you would see them "one on one".

0:41:02.860,0:41:10.020
You would ask, what happened, what were their case about, why they were sentenced for a life in a prison.

0:41:10.020,0:41:18.240
If you listen to some of their stories and follow it up, you would establish the truth and save them.

0:41:18.240,0:41:25.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:41:25.260,0:41:31.180
Many are being held innocent.

0:41:31.180,0:41:42.600
This is why many of us face failures in business despite your efforts.

0:41:42.600,0:41:45.760
Opportunities are given to others instead you.

0:41:45.760,0:41:46.760
It does not mean that God is not aware.

0:41:46.760,0:41:51.960
God wants you to go through disappointment that you may know what it means to be disappointed.

0:41:51.960,0:42:03.060
When you become rich, you can know what disappointed people feel.

0:42:03.060,0:42:04.940
It is not too late.

0:42:04.940,0:42:07.940
God wants you to be strong.

0:42:07.940,0:42:13.940
It is good to be strong before you become victorious.

0:42:13.940,0:42:22.160
I thank God that I passed through all this.

0:42:22.160,0:42:24.220
Yes.

0:42:24.220,0:42:31.160
Even without regard to my age, but it is good.

0:42:31.160,0:42:37.100
You will trust in authority not majority if you pass through all this.

0:42:37.100,0:42:42.140
You always trust in majority.

0:42:42.140,0:42:47.820
To trust a majority is to trust so much in people to help you,

0:42:47.820,0:42:51.960
instead of running to your prayer room, running to God.

0:42:51.960,0:42:57.600
God will be the one to tell you, "Go to this person, go to that person..."

0:42:57.600,0:42:59.880
God will choose those who will support you.

0:42:59.880,0:43:02.020
It is not you who will choose them.

0:43:02.020,0:43:07.460
He has his people and He knows His people, and He will show you His people.

0:43:07.460,0:43:14.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:14.020,0:43:21.680
You need a counsel, something you take home, something you meditate over.

0:43:21.680,0:43:26.840
You need it.

0:43:26.840,0:43:31.220
Look at our champions all over the world.

0:43:31.220,0:43:35.480
How many of them run the race to the end?

0:43:35.480,0:43:41.620
Our champions today - they end bad.

0:43:41.620,0:43:46.400
Many of the richest people all over the world end bad.

0:43:46.400,0:43:49.620
They often end as poor people, before they die.

0:43:49.620,0:43:54.120
Champions in all areas of life - they don't end well.

0:43:54.120,0:43:55.960
Why?

0:43:55.960,0:44:01.100
The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.

0:44:01.100,0:44:08.560
Champions don't end well.

0:44:08.560,0:44:13.960
God doesn't want your journey to go like that.

0:44:13.960,0:44:16.580
He wants you to end well.

0:44:16.580,0:44:28.320
To end well is to experience trials, disappointments, appointments, failures, successes -

0:44:28.320,0:44:30.100
you have to pass through all this.

0:44:30.100,0:44:32.900
Be strong!

0:44:32.900,0:44:33.940
You have to be strong.

0:44:33.940,0:44:35.680
Forget about your age.

0:44:35.680,0:44:39.920
If you are getting too old, God can add to your age.

0:44:39.920,0:44:44.580
You will achieve what He wants you to achieve.

0:44:44.580,0:44:50.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:44:50.200,0:44:55.240
You look at your age, "I'm getting old now. I have not achieved this or that.

0:44:55.240,0:44:58.160
Am I going to achieve it at the age of 70?"

0:44:58.160,0:45:00.540
Forget about that.

0:45:00.540,0:45:07.180
Which kind of age are you talking about?

0:45:07.180,0:45:10.400
There are two ages.

0:45:10.400,0:45:14.620
You know one age, the other age you don't know.

0:45:14.620,0:45:17.760
God knows.

0:45:17.760,0:45:21.420
The other age is the age at which you will leave this world.

0:45:21.420,0:45:26.960
The age you know cannot tell you when you will leave this world.

0:45:26.960,0:45:31.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:45:31.140,0:45:35.960
There are two ages; the one you know - the one that started when you were born,

0:45:35.960,0:45:42.800
the other age is with God - when you will leave this world.

0:45:42.800,0:45:47.320
Any time you sit down and think about your age, remember about the other age that you don't know.

0:45:47.320,0:45:49.720
That one is more important.

0:45:49.720,0:45:55.640
What you will leave behind, if today is your last day on earth...

0:45:55.640,0:46:02.740
What you will leave behind is more important than what you claim to achieve.

0:46:02.740,0:46:10.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:10.380,0:46:13.040
Think about that other age.

0:46:13.040,0:46:16.140
Two ages.

0:46:16.140,0:46:24.860
God owns age - and you are celebrating your own age, but the God's own age is there.

0:46:24.860,0:46:33.340
So, just be happy and give thanks to God.

0:46:33.340,0:46:42.720
No matter what happened, no matter what comes - Jesus is good all the time.

0:46:42.720,0:46:48.860
It is good for you.

0:46:48.860,0:46:51.680
You just have to start as a new baby.

0:46:51.680,0:46:56.420
There are many things you don't know - like this relationship I'm talking about.

0:46:56.420,0:47:07.800
Little thing, fight, disagreement, lie; hey, today I quit, it is no longer my friend - no.

0:47:07.800,0:47:11.140
Situation should not break your relationship.

0:47:11.140,0:47:16.040
Challenges should not break a relationship.

0:47:16.040,0:47:23.280
Conditions should not break a relationship - let God Himself quit.

0:47:23.280,0:47:28.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:47:28.040,0:47:34.260
God Himself is a Father of relationships - he should be the one to decide whether to quit.

0:47:34.260,0:47:42.900
Many of them are leaders all over the world.

0:47:42.900,0:47:45.380
You run to them saying that you knew them from the beginning.

0:47:45.380,0:47:51.240
They are leaders now.

0:47:51.240,0:47:53.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:47:53.960,0:47:59.620
You look at names of people managing the bank - you will be surprised that you know them.

0:47:59.620,0:48:02.980
Some of them own companies.

0:48:02.980,0:48:09.040
God's will does things in mysterious ways - you have to be very careful.

0:48:09.040,0:48:20.360
If at your work place they tell that they demote you - don't leave because of this reason.

0:48:20.360,0:48:23.700
You need to ask God for the direction.

0:48:23.700,0:48:33.060
They may demote you, they may put the junior one at the superior position, they can cut a half of your salary -

0:48:33.060,0:48:37.600
don't quit because of that.

0:48:37.600,0:48:42.040
You need to examine what has happened.

0:48:42.040,0:48:54.620
God can use any foolish thing - these are the bad things - to try to address you.

0:48:54.620,0:49:06.820
And when you are given a sack letter, although you did nothing wrong, just smile - God is still saying something.

0:49:06.820,0:49:12.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:49:12.840,0:49:16.160
What can God say through a sack letter?

0:49:16.160,0:49:24.560
Yes, remember about those who are still alive and those who already died.

0:49:24.560,0:49:29.660
If you ask the richest people in the world, owners of big companies,

0:49:29.660,0:49:39.080
what let them to establish their own companies - it was a sack letter given to them.

0:49:39.080,0:49:44.260
If they were not given the sack letter, they would have not discovered themselves.

0:49:44.260,0:49:45.800
I have a good example.

0:49:45.800,0:49:51.260
Emmanuel TV is the first "satellite" here...

0:49:51.260,0:49:53.620
I want to give you a story.

0:49:53.620,0:50:00.060
When I was airing my program on one of the national channels...

0:50:00.060,0:50:04.900
Because of me they did not allow showing miracles in Nigeria.

0:50:04.900,0:50:07.800
Just because of me alone.

0:50:07.800,0:50:12.740
And they told me that showing miracles was not allowed.

0:50:12.740,0:50:16.760
I asked them how should I arrange my program.

0:50:16.760,0:50:20.500
They said, "Just talk. Jesus is love."

0:50:20.500,0:50:26.820
I removed all my programs from that TV station and I went to the mountain to pray.

0:50:26.820,0:50:36.060
God said, "Yes, I am aware. I want you to discover yourself. I will give you a channel called Emmanuel TV."

0:50:36.060,0:50:44.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:50:44.580,0:50:46.260
Emmanuel TV.

0:50:46.260,0:50:51.000
The name Emmanuel is too long - that is what I said to myself.

0:50:51.000,0:50:55.300
I purposely changed it to SCOAN TV.

0:50:55.300,0:51:00.240
I said Emmanuel TV was too long - but I heard it clearly - Emmanuel TV.

0:51:00.240,0:51:02.820
I said that this Emmanuel TV name would be too long.

0:51:02.820,0:51:06.160
I would need to write the whole name - Emmanuel TV.

0:51:06.160,0:51:13.440
I see other names of stations - they are all 3 or 4 letters, and why mine would be so long?

0:51:13.440,0:51:15.220
Can you see?

0:51:15.220,0:51:18.640
That is human; and God said "Emmanuel TV".

0:51:18.640,0:51:24.400
I went to register the SCOAN TV.

0:51:24.400,0:51:30.160
First two months the TV was broadcast with the name "SCOAN TV".

0:51:30.160,0:51:37.140
One night, around 2 am I had a vision; the atmosphere changed in the room.

0:51:37.140,0:51:44.640
I was warned, "When you wake up change this name to Emmanuel TV".

0:51:44.640,0:51:47.200
This is an instruction from God.

0:51:47.200,0:51:51.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:51:51.780,0:51:54.580
We started to wrestle.

0:51:54.580,0:51:57.060
There was no way we could have done it in Nigeria.

0:51:57.060,0:52:01.520
There were no law, no relevant machines, no technologies to do it.

0:52:01.520,0:52:05.680
We had to travel to another country.

0:52:05.680,0:52:08.900
That is how Emmanuel TV started.

0:52:08.900,0:52:13.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:52:13.140,0:52:18.560
I if hadn't quit, would I have discovered myself?

0:52:18.560,0:52:20.560
[No.]

0:52:20.560,0:52:27.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:52:27.560,0:52:31.780
It is now the most popular Christian channel all over the world.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:52:39.620,0:52:47.760
When that disappointment comes, God is speaking through that to you.

We say, "Don't cry. Don't lament. Don't despair. Don't worry. Even in case of sickness."

0:52:57.460,0:53:06.660
I know we have made a lot of mistakes in the past; in marriages, businesses...

0:53:06.660,0:53:16.180
Even if you invested in business and the whole thing went bankrupt - it is not enough to quit.

0:53:16.180,0:53:18.600
Because bankruptcy is not God.

0:53:18.600,0:53:24.500
Only God has the right to say quit.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:53:31.340,0:53:35.520
Don't get frustrated at all.

0:53:35.520,0:53:38.740
This world is unstable.

0:53:38.740,0:53:40.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:53:40.080,0:53:41.820
[This world is unstable.]

0:53:41.820,0:53:42.900
I cannot hear you.

0:53:42.900,0:53:44.720
[This world is unstable.]

0:53:44.720,0:53:46.300
Yes.

0:53:46.300,0:53:54.840
You are walking on unstable ground.

0:53:54.840,0:53:56.200
It is unstable.

0:53:56.200,0:54:02.680
This is why the Bible says, "In this world there will be trouble. There will be tribulation."

0:54:02.680,0:54:08.040
And this is why He said to Peter, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:54:08.040,0:54:09.280
Please!

0:54:09.280,0:54:19.600
That shows there are some challenges, situations that will come to shake you because this world is unstable.

0:54:19.600,0:54:20.980
I know right.

0:54:20.980,0:54:23.320
But you are walking in this world which is unstable.

0:54:23.320,0:54:25.360
When something happens to you, you know it is unstable.

0:54:25.360,0:54:28.460
What do you expect from a place that is not stable?

0:54:28.460,0:54:30.980
You were about to fall.

0:54:30.980,0:54:34.660
And if you are not strong enough you will fall.

0:54:34.660,0:54:40.200
But if you are strong enough you will get back to balance.

0:54:46.780,0:54:54.880
You are not in heaven; you are in this world.

0:54:54.880,0:55:07.380
If things are going smoothly, without challenges - it is not good that all problems come in later days

0:55:07.380,0:55:10.780
because there will be no much strength in you.

0:55:10.780,0:55:13.080
This is what happens to many of you.

0:55:13.080,0:55:19.180
You have a brother, a rich man, an authority man that help you...

0:55:19.180,0:55:25.540
Your brother is a governor, president, senator, you are very strong, your brother is a rich man,

0:55:25.540,0:55:27.360
they keep helping you.

0:55:27.360,0:55:32.040
When you are about to fall they will help you.

0:55:32.040,0:55:42.080
You can just sit at home making a phone call and getting what you want...

0:55:42.080,0:55:45.220
I'm afraid.

0:55:45.220,0:55:52.760
I'm afraid the moment they will not be there for you.

0:55:52.760,0:55:55.600
I will continue to pray for you.

0:55:55.600,0:55:57.340
Take this counsel.

0:55:57.340,0:55:58.700
Take it home.

0:55:58.700,0:56:05.860
Pass on my greetings to your children, your junior ones, those who are not here.

0:56:05.860,0:56:08.160
Say to them, "T.B. Joshua greets them".

0:56:08.160,0:56:09.740
[Amen.]

0:56:09.740,0:56:11.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:56:11.640,0:56:19.540
Help me to greet them with this message.

0:56:19.540,0:56:21.580
Now, we find ourselves in the war.

0:56:21.580,0:56:33.040
We cannot tell our children, "Go this way" because you do not know which way leads to success.

0:56:33.040,0:56:37.640
You are not on the way to success either.

0:56:37.640,0:56:44.040
We don't have a road map, and we are showing the road.

0:56:44.040,0:56:45.640
Are you a road map?

0:56:45.640,0:56:47.120
No.

0:56:47.120,0:56:51.720
That is why it is so difficult for our children to follow our instructions.

0:56:51.720,0:56:57.740
They look at you, they pity you, they are the ones supporting the house.

0:56:57.740,0:57:02.640
They are the ones who counsel you.

0:57:02.640,0:57:08.140
Where is the instruction, where is the name momma, where is the name baba?

0:57:08.140,0:57:10.980
Father - what is the meaning of father?

0:57:10.980,0:57:14.500
The world has turned to that.

0:57:14.500,0:57:21.660
Pass my greetings to them and tell them, "Look, Jesus is our father".

0:57:21.660,0:57:24.060
[Amen.]

0:57:24.060,0:57:32.940
The only legacy you can give to your children is to show them the way to the Lord.

0:57:32.940,0:57:34.900
I'm telling you.

0:57:34.900,0:57:37.980
Your property is no longer your legacy.

0:57:37.980,0:57:41.680
Your wealth is no longer your legacy.

0:57:41.680,0:57:49.240
It is like your wealth, property, money, houses... you write a will to give it to them...

0:57:49.240,0:57:53.300
It is like you are willing trouble for them.

0:57:53.300,0:57:56.920
[Amen.]

0:57:56.920,0:58:04.060
I'm saying - those properties, money in the bank, you are very rich, you want to give it to your children -

0:58:04.060,0:58:07.180
it is like you are willing trouble for them.

0:58:07.180,0:58:11.100
Yes, they only will...

0:58:11.100,0:58:18.120
Show them the way of the Lord; let them achieve it themselves.

0:58:18.120,0:58:20.960
Way, where is the way?

0:58:20.960,0:58:25.200
Where is that way?

0:58:25.200,0:58:27.780
Thank you.
