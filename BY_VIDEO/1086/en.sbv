0:00:00.020,0:00:04.180
Hallelujah!

0:00:04.180,0:00:07.920
Good Morning!

0:00:07.920,0:00:10.980
When I was coming, I saw our children.

0:00:10.980,0:00:12.980
They were rejoicing.

0:00:12.980,0:00:16.400
I asked them, "What is happening here?"

0:00:16.400,0:00:18.720
They said, "Today is Children's Day!"

0:00:18.720,0:00:22.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:22.780,0:00:32.020
We want to salute you, children; we so much believe you are the leaders of tomorrow.

0:00:32.020,0:00:33.720
We salute you!

0:00:33.720,0:00:34.840
Thank you.

0:00:34.840,0:00:38.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:38.640,0:00:41.600
Hallelujah!

0:00:41.600,0:00:44.580
I was looking round when you people were dancing.

0:00:44.580,0:00:47.240
I saw many people (dancing), whilst others were not.

0:00:47.240,0:00:52.560
You have to rejoice with those who are rejoicing.

0:00:52.560,0:01:04.540
The Bible says, if you fail to rejoice with those who rejoice, your day of rejoicing may be delayed.

0:01:04.540,0:01:05.440
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:05.440,0:01:08.200
The Bible says, if you fail to rejoice with those who rejoice, your day of rejoicing may be delayed.

0:01:08.200,0:01:22.000
If you fail to rejoice with those who are rejoicing, your day of rejoicing may delay.

0:01:22.000,0:01:24.440
I will not say more than that.

0:01:24.440,0:01:29.980
So this is why you see me - when I just see people dancing, I actually join them.

0:01:29.980,0:01:32.120
I'm not pretending; I really mean it.

0:01:32.120,0:01:34.500
If you are dancing now, I will join you.

0:01:34.500,0:01:37.640
So please, you have to do so.

0:01:37.640,0:01:46.220
Sometimes when we allow our feelings to take over us, our senses to take over us,

0:01:46.220,0:01:53.720
we begin to say, "Until it happens to me, it has not happened!"

0:01:53.720,0:02:00.400
"Until I feel it, until it happens to me, it has not happened!"

0:02:00.400,0:02:04.040
Those who are giving testimony - "Oh yes, they are healed!

0:02:04.040,0:02:08.820
But I have my own here - until I am healed!"

0:02:08.820,0:02:14.540
That is the voice of senses, the voice of feelings.

0:02:14.540,0:02:18.840
"Until it happens to me, it has not happened!"

0:02:18.840,0:02:25.620
Don't allow that; you are a child of God and you know what faith is.

0:02:25.620,0:02:32.260
You need to know His faithfulness and trustworthiness.

0:02:32.260,0:02:37.060
Trust and obey
For there's no other way

0:02:37.060,0:02:45.400
To be happy in Jesus
Than to trust and obey

0:02:45.400,0:02:47.980
So you are the one singing this.

0:02:47.980,0:02:50.260
That is the song; it is a common song.

0:02:50.260,0:02:53.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:53.180,0:02:55.820
You have to.

0:02:55.820,0:02:58.340
Overflow Congregation

0:02:58.340,0:03:12.700
You have seen God is reliable and the moment you see this happen, it causes your faith to grow.

0:03:12.700,0:03:17.620
It will spontaneously, side-by-side, grow.

0:03:17.620,0:03:23.220
That is your faith - you know, faith is natural.

0:03:23.220,0:03:30.740
With what you have seen today, the testimonies of others are meant to build your faith.

0:03:30.740,0:03:35.040
It is not just to, "Eh, eh..."

0:03:35.040,0:03:36.780
It is to build your faith.

0:03:36.780,0:03:48.300
Don't let unnecessary anxiety - being anxious for now and the future - to take over you.

0:03:48.300,0:03:54.220
These are the tools satan uses to trap us.

0:03:54.220,0:03:58.820
If satan does not want you to be here and you are here, he has a way of doing it.

0:03:58.820,0:04:01.820
It will take over your thoughts, your heart.

0:04:01.820,0:04:05.020
You will begin to say, "Ah, when will this happen to me?

0:04:05.020,0:04:11.320
When will I get healed? When will T.B. Joshua touch me?

0:04:11.320,0:04:13.520
I don't know. I have been to many places".

0:04:13.520,0:04:17.900
Whilst you are sitting down watching, your thoughts will be taken over by all this.

0:04:17.900,0:04:19.700
Anxious!

0:04:19.700,0:04:21.520
"What time?"

0:04:21.520,0:04:23.900
"I'm still feeling it."

0:04:23.900,0:04:27.600
"How much does the man want to collect? Do you think this can be free?"

0:04:27.600,0:04:41.280
These are the tools satan uses to trap us, to torture us, to capture us.

0:04:41.280,0:04:53.140
You will be sitting down whilst all this will be going on in your heart.

0:04:53.140,0:04:56.620
Don't be anxious.

0:04:56.620,0:05:00.040
That is why we are here.

0:05:00.040,0:05:02.040
"When? How?"

0:05:02.040,0:05:07.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:07.160,0:05:20.260
When you are anxious of your now and future, God's time does not matter to you.

0:05:20.260,0:05:36.180
When you are anxious of your now and future, where the solution comes from does not matter

0:05:36.180,0:05:44.500
because of desperation.

0:05:44.500,0:05:48.220
Because of what? - Desperation.

0:05:48.220,0:05:52.820
You will not listen to what other people are saying, testimonies of others,

0:05:52.820,0:05:55.860
"No, until I give my testimony!"

0:05:55.860,0:05:58.320
That is the thought that will be going on in your heart.

0:05:58.320,0:06:05.420
"No!" - "Oh yes, it happened!" - "Until I give my testimony; until I see it!"

0:06:05.420,0:06:07.520
When people are saying, "Thank You, Jesus!",

0:06:07.520,0:06:12.720
you will be looking round, trying to see, "What happened?"

0:06:12.720,0:06:16.540
before you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:06:16.540,0:06:19.160
You see people standing up, "What happened?"

0:06:19.160,0:06:25.340
They want to see what happened before they can say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:06:25.340,0:06:27.340
Are you with me?

0:06:27.340,0:06:34.000
You have to work on your heart, the state of your heart.

0:06:34.000,0:06:40.880
If it is not at its best, you are just wasting your time

0:06:40.880,0:06:47.680
because our heart is the contact point.

0:06:47.680,0:06:54.180
What is going on in your heart now?

0:06:54.180,0:07:00.920
Are you looking at my size, my stature, the way I talk?

0:07:00.920,0:07:05.520
Are you examining my words - the content or the grammar?

0:07:05.520,0:07:11.560
A lot of things - people keep busy. Many are here; many are not here.

0:07:11.560,0:07:15.220
You can see the church - everyone on the seat.

0:07:15.220,0:07:23.560
You will be very surprised that the person you see sitting down is standing.

0:07:23.560,0:07:27.880
You can be sitting and also what? - Standing.

0:07:27.880,0:07:33.300
Because you have two natures in one person.

0:07:33.300,0:07:39.760
Yours can be sitting and your divine nature standing.

0:07:39.760,0:07:44.900
Who is sitting?

0:07:44.900,0:07:46.880
Who is looking at me?

0:07:46.880,0:07:48.880
Hallelujah.

0:07:48.880,0:07:56.480
Right now, begin to cast your burden on God. He will care for you.

0:07:56.480,0:08:00.260
With Him, all things are possible.

0:08:00.260,0:08:02.040
Hallelujah.

0:08:02.040,0:08:04.380
Do you know God loves you?

0:08:04.380,0:08:07.000
How do you know? Can somebody stand up and tell me,

0:08:07.000,0:08:12.880
How do you know Jesus loves you and how do you know you love Jesus?

0:08:12.880,0:08:15.580
Can somebody?

0:08:15.580,0:08:17.760
Yes?

0:08:17.760,0:08:23.780
Because I receive emails: People say that wherever I face, I usually ask questions from.

0:08:23.780,0:08:25.860
Yes?

0:08:25.860,0:08:27.160
Ok, yes?

0:08:27.160,0:08:34.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:34.120,0:08:36.520
Ok, let's hear from you.

0:08:36.520,0:08:39.440
Because we wake up every day with the breath of life.

0:08:39.440,0:08:42.140
The issue of miracles.

0:08:42.140,0:08:45.120
You like miracles too much.

0:08:45.120,0:08:48.440
Can you see now? You wake up every day.

0:08:48.440,0:08:52.920
If you do not wake up, it does not mean Jesus does not love you.

0:08:52.920,0:08:56.960
It has to do with grace; grace allows you to wake up.

0:08:56.960,0:08:59.640
You said, "Because you wake up every day".

0:08:59.640,0:09:05.340
I said, "If you do not wake up, it does not mean Jesus does not love you".

0:09:05.340,0:09:06.800
He still loves you.

0:09:06.800,0:09:10.900
How do you know?

0:09:10.900,0:09:13.460
How do you know? You must tell us.

0:09:13.460,0:09:19.440
You wake up or you do not wake up - which is the greater love from Jesus?

0:09:19.440,0:09:21.660
You wake up is the greater love from Jesus.

0:09:21.660,0:09:24.500
Ahhh!

0:09:24.500,0:09:26.260
Can you see now?

0:09:26.260,0:09:29.520
You wake up or you do not wake up - which is the greatest love?

0:09:29.520,0:09:35.340
She said to wake up is the greatest love so she can continue her sin.

0:09:35.340,0:09:45.800
If Jesus sees that you continue this wrong thing and He calls you home, is that not a blessing?

0:09:45.800,0:09:49.560
Can't you know that this death is also a miracle?

0:09:49.560,0:09:57.120
Not all - but it is a miracle.

0:09:57.120,0:10:02.980
Death is a miracle; it is a blessing.

0:10:02.980,0:10:06.480
If the Lord realises you are a candidate of Heaven

0:10:06.480,0:10:12.800
and in a minute you may lose that Heaven, He may call you home.

0:10:12.800,0:10:14.280
Are you with me?

0:10:14.280,0:10:15.200
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:15.200,0:10:21.380
If you are a candidate of Heaven and in a minute you may lose that Heaven,

0:10:21.380,0:10:26.560
He will call you before that minute.

0:10:26.560,0:10:31.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:31.580,0:10:32.820
What else again?

0:10:32.820,0:10:36.860
I know Jesus loves me because of what He did on the Cross for me.

0:10:36.860,0:10:41.560
You know that?

0:10:41.560,0:10:45.800
Did you read it or your heart told you this?

0:10:45.800,0:10:47.600
How do you know this?

0:10:47.600,0:10:54.320
First, I learned it before I started acting on it and then I got to know that the Word of God is true.

0:10:54.320,0:11:01.020
No one would die for you without knowing you but He did die on the Cross to save me.

0:11:01.020,0:11:04.540
Are you preaching?

0:11:04.540,0:11:05.800
Who are you?

0:11:05.800,0:11:10.640
I am Zelda; I am a child of God.

0:11:10.640,0:11:12.780
How do we know you are a child of God?

0:11:12.780,0:11:15.540
By my actions and by doing the Word of God.

0:11:15.540,0:11:21.620
We have not seen any action; how do we know this?

0:11:21.620,0:11:23.400
My heart.

0:11:23.400,0:11:28.640
Your heart - we can't see your heart.

0:11:28.640,0:11:30.420
Yes, we are listening.

0:11:30.420,0:11:32.260
Because God knows my heart.

0:11:32.260,0:11:37.640
How do we know what you are saying is from your heart and is not something you memorised?

0:11:37.640,0:11:39.620
Clap for her.

0:11:39.620,0:11:44.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:44.080,0:11:45.180
Yes?

0:11:45.180,0:11:46.960
Let's ask the old man.

0:11:46.960,0:11:54.340
The love of Jesus is evident in every activity we perform every day.

0:11:54.340,0:12:00.860
You cannot do anything without doing it in correspondence with His power and grace -

0:12:00.860,0:12:04.280
from breathing, seeing, walking and even talking.

0:12:04.280,0:12:06.520
We are not saying you should talk for us.

0:12:06.520,0:12:08.320
Who is Jesus to you?

0:12:08.320,0:12:14.340
How do you know Jesus loves you? How do we know that you love Jesus?

0:12:14.340,0:12:21.120
I know that I love Jesus because to a certain degree, I am living...

0:12:21.120,0:12:26.480
To a certain degree Jesus measured for you?

0:12:26.480,0:12:27.020
No.

0:12:27.020,0:12:32.640
That degree is the degree Jesus has measured that you should not go beyond that degree?

0:12:32.640,0:12:35.100
There is a certain limit...

0:12:35.100,0:12:36.280
...Jesus gave you?

0:12:36.280,0:12:37.240
No.

0:12:37.240,0:12:41.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:41.380,0:12:43.040
Ok.

0:12:43.040,0:12:46.280
Jesus is an everlasting Lover.

0:12:46.280,0:12:51.660
He loves you all through and gives you the chance to keep loving Him too.

0:12:51.660,0:12:59.800
But the measure of how I know how He knows is a spiritual factor; I am a human being.

0:12:59.800,0:13:01.040
Absolutely.

0:13:01.040,0:13:05.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:05.880,0:13:07.540
You are a human being?

0:13:07.540,0:13:11.060
Sure. I am not in the Spirit power with God.

0:13:11.060,0:13:15.640
But His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.

0:13:15.640,0:13:17.540
So, it means, you are not a Christian.

0:13:17.540,0:13:19.180
Yes, absolutely.

0:13:19.180,0:13:22.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:22.380,0:13:23.580
Clap for baba.

0:13:23.580,0:13:25.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:25.780,0:13:28.420
We thank God you are able to tell us this.

0:13:28.420,0:13:31.100
Thank you, sir.

0:13:31.100,0:13:38.600
You are going to start from where baba said he is a human being and not a spirit.

0:13:38.600,0:13:40.480
Is that true of you?

0:13:40.480,0:13:42.240
Yes, Man of God.

0:13:42.240,0:13:43.760
That you are a human being?

0:13:43.760,0:13:44.880
I am a human being.

0:13:44.880,0:13:47.160
You are not a spirit?

0:13:47.160,0:13:48.980
Sir, we are two beings.

0:13:48.980,0:13:50.840
I asked, "Are you not a spirit?"

0:13:50.840,0:13:52.900
I am a spirit, living in the flesh.

0:13:52.900,0:13:53.520
Eh hen.

0:13:53.520,0:13:54.060
Yes, sir.

0:13:54.060,0:13:57.000
How do you live in the flesh?

0:13:57.000,0:13:59.080
I have a soul and I have flesh.

0:13:59.080,0:14:04.160
We know you have a soul; that is why you have to eat rice and beans.

0:14:04.160,0:14:05.500
Yes, Man of God.

0:14:05.500,0:14:08.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:08.120,0:14:09.640
We know that.

0:14:09.640,0:14:10.300
Yes?

0:14:10.300,0:14:15.220
I know Jesus loves me because He died on the Cross of Calvary for my sake

0:14:15.220,0:14:17.780
and He still prays for me.

0:14:17.780,0:14:19.580
How do you realise this?

0:14:19.580,0:14:22.820
I realise that through Scriptures.

0:14:22.820,0:14:25.880
Through Scriptures. Yes?

0:14:25.880,0:14:28.920
I know I love Him; that is why I am here.

0:14:28.920,0:14:33.480
But there is no way we can know that what you are saying is true of you.

0:14:33.480,0:14:36.080
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:14:36.080,0:14:42.360
We know that.

0:14:42.360,0:14:49.740
I live my life for Him - reading the Scriptures day-by-day

0:14:49.740,0:14:53.660
and meditating on Him through the Word of God.

0:14:53.660,0:14:54.960
Ok. Thank you.

Jesus loves me because I have committed a lot of sins and a lot of things happened to me.

0:15:06.720,0:15:10.040
There were things that were supposed to have killed me but I'm still existing today.

0:15:10.040,0:15:12.900
If not for Jesus, I would be a dead man by now.

0:15:12.900,0:15:14.500
He loves me - that is why I'm still existing.

0:15:14.500,0:15:19.040
For you not to have died, what is the reward to Jesus?

0:15:19.040,0:15:21.860
I have to serve Him and love Him back.

0:15:21.860,0:15:25.020
I have to serve Jesus truthfully and love Him back.

0:15:25.020,0:15:26.420
You have not been doing that.

0:15:26.420,0:15:27.760
Of course, sir.

0:15:27.760,0:15:32.300
Can you see, your living seems to be in vain.

0:15:32.300,0:15:33.540
Yes, sir.

0:15:33.540,0:15:35.620
What next? Do you want to die?

0:15:35.620,0:15:37.280
No, I don't want to die now.

0:15:37.280,0:15:41.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:41.680,0:15:44.400
Thank you, my brother. Clap for him.

0:15:44.400,0:15:49.640
He says he doesn't want to die. He still promises Jesus to do better.

0:15:49.640,0:15:52.940
The Lord will give you the strength.

0:15:52.940,0:15:54.460
Ok, thank you.

0:15:54.460,0:16:02.240
I know Jesus loves me because we are told that God's love, Jesus' love, is unconditional.

0:16:02.240,0:16:07.220
So, I know that God loves me and I love Him too.

0:16:07.220,0:16:10.360
You love Him too - very frank.

0:16:10.360,0:16:12.360
Yes, Man of God.

0:16:12.360,0:16:13.400
You said?

0:16:13.400,0:16:21.980
I love Jesus because I know He loves me and His love is unconditional - for everybody.

0:16:21.980,0:16:26.820
I partake - I thank God I partake in God's love because I am His child.

0:16:26.820,0:16:30.160
You have to work on your forgiveness.

0:16:30.160,0:16:30.940
Yes, sir.

0:16:30.940,0:16:33.100
I said, you need to work on your forgiveness.

0:16:33.100,0:16:34.260
Yes, Man of God.

0:16:34.260,0:16:37.460
Because you have to forgive this man.

0:16:37.460,0:16:40.440
Okay - yes, Man of God.

0:16:40.440,0:16:41.540
I want to see you.

0:16:41.540,0:16:42.480
My husband.

0:16:42.480,0:16:43.240
I will see you.

0:16:43.240,0:16:44.320
Thank you, sir.

0:16:44.320,0:16:46.460
Thank you.

0:16:46.460,0:16:49.360
Let's go to the other side.

0:16:49.360,0:16:54.900
You will answer this question: By what authority are you here today?

0:16:54.900,0:16:59.560
We see you in The SCOAN; we don't know if you were led by the Spirit

0:16:59.560,0:17:07.840
or you are here to see your Chairman or loved one or your loved one carried you to church today.

0:17:07.840,0:17:08.840
You are welcome.

0:17:08.840,0:17:13.000
Can you be able to tell us, by what authority are you here today?

0:17:13.000,0:17:16.500
By the special grace of God, I am here to fulfill the purpose of God

0:17:16.500,0:17:20.300
because before God created me, He knew I would be here today.

0:17:20.300,0:17:24.960
Ok. So, you know if it is Jesus, we don't lie against Jesus.

0:17:24.960,0:17:27.500
What you are saying now, I cannot dispute it.

0:17:27.500,0:17:28.280
Ok?

0:17:28.280,0:17:33.380
I'm here by God's authority to come to the Arena of Liberty.

0:17:33.380,0:17:36.640
I'm seeking for God's intervention in my life.

0:17:36.640,0:17:41.500
So God led me to this place by His authority.

0:17:41.500,0:17:45.080
If God does not intervene, what will happen?

0:17:45.080,0:17:49.740
If God did not intervene, I wouldn't be here and my life would go astray.

0:17:49.740,0:17:53.360
And if nothing happens today, what will happen?

0:17:53.360,0:18:00.640
By the fact that I am here - it means God has done something in my life.

0:18:00.640,0:18:04.620
Tell us, what has God done in your life now?

0:18:04.620,0:18:07.880
God has increased my faith by my being here

0:18:07.880,0:18:14.860
and whatever that brought me here, I can see that God is taking care of it.

0:18:14.860,0:18:16.440
Thank you.

0:18:16.440,0:18:18.440
Did you listen to her?

0:18:18.440,0:18:23.920
This is confession. But the belief in her heart is over to God.

0:18:23.920,0:18:26.920
You don't know what you are confessing is what you believe.

0:18:26.920,0:18:30.420
How do we know that what you are confessing is what you believe?

0:18:30.420,0:18:35.760
It wouldn't be visible but if I say it in confidence because it is coming from my heart,

0:18:35.760,0:18:38.660
and my actions change according to what I say,

0:18:38.660,0:18:42.320
then people will know that what I was saying was truthful.

0:18:42.320,0:18:45.020
But people listen to your voice.

0:18:45.020,0:18:52.100
It is difficult for them to be able to know who is talking and by what authority.

0:18:52.100,0:18:55.540
The confidence in me - I am directed and led by God.

0:18:55.540,0:18:57.720
Thank you. Any other?

0:18:57.720,0:19:01.780
I think I am here because of God's plan.

0:19:01.780,0:19:09.000
I believe that each and every plan we have is not our plan; it is God's plan.

0:19:09.000,0:19:10.900
God knows best.

0:19:10.900,0:19:14.840
I tried before; I didn't manage to come.

0:19:14.840,0:19:17.400
I think because it wasn't God's time.

0:19:17.400,0:19:18.860
It wasn't God's time.

0:19:18.860,0:19:20.460
This is God's time now?

0:19:20.460,0:19:21.900
It is God's time.

0:19:21.900,0:19:22.800
Thank you.

0:19:22.800,0:19:31.220
Viewers, you are there and we are here. We just want to awaken your spirit.
