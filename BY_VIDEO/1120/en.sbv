Hallelujah!

0:00:02.880,0:00:04.060
I can't hear you.

0:00:04.060,0:00:05.620
[Amen!]

0:00:05.620,0:00:13.260
There is one strange thing that keeps disturbing us on the social media concerncing

0:00:13.260,0:00:22.640
the Thailand football team with thirteen players who are trapped in a cave.

0:00:22.640,0:00:26.380
Please, raise up your voice. They are little children.

0:00:26.380,0:00:32.520
It disturbs the whole world. It has become worldwide.

0:00:32.520,0:00:37.900
Please, open your lips. Ask God to intervene and rescue these children.

0:00:37.900,0:00:43.340
Because every minute, the news about them is so frightening -

0:00:43.340,0:00:47.340
that they cannot carry them because there is too much water.

0:00:47.340,0:00:51.380
These children are crying; they are lamenting.

0:00:51.380,0:00:56.680
They cannot spend more than...

0:00:56.680,0:01:02.360
Please, open your lips and pray for God's intervention.

0:01:02.360,0:01:05.540
The divers and the people that want to rescue them -

0:01:05.540,0:01:10.240
God should inspire them what to do and how to do it.

0:01:10.240,0:01:19.200
There is nothing on this earth... With God, all things are possible.

0:01:19.200,0:01:22.840
Yes, the Lord should rescue these children -

0:01:22.840,0:01:27.360
rescue them, help them, in Jesus Christ's name!

0:01:27.360,0:01:29.400
Amen!
