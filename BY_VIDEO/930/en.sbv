0:00:00.300,0:00:09.840
Prophet T.B. Joshua is led by the Holy Ghost to pray for visitors to The SCOAN from all over the globe in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:09.840,0:00:16.520
Whatever barrier, affliction or challenge they were facing melted like wax before the Lord of hosts

0:00:16.520,0:00:19.840
at the mention of the name Jesus Christ in prayer.

0:00:19.840,0:00:24.800
As the ministration continued, surprisingly, this woman sprang from her seat,

0:00:24.800,0:00:30.020
moments before the man of God got to her, and started running away across the auditorium.

0:00:30.020,0:00:31.940
Let's find out why.

0:00:31.940,0:00:33.720
We'll kill everyone here.

0:00:33.720,0:00:35.620
Who are you?

0:00:35.620,0:00:37.780
Ancestors.

0:00:37.780,0:00:39.280
What have you done to her ?

0:00:39.280,0:00:40.380
Ancestors.

0:00:40.380,0:00:43.900
I will kill that husband; I will kill her husband.

0:00:43.900,0:00:47.100
What have you done to her marriage?

0:00:47.100,0:00:55.160
Which marriage? There is no marriage.

0:00:55.160,0:00:57.360
What have you done to her career?

0:00:57.360,0:01:00.360
Which career?

0:01:00.360,0:01:04.260
I have destroyed this lady; I have destroyed her.

0:01:04.260,0:01:11.820
She will kill you. This lady - she will kill you. Just leave here; leave here right now.

0:01:11.820,0:01:16.380
Breaking whatever chain the devil had used to bind this woman to himself,

0:01:16.380,0:01:20.880
Prophet T.B. Joshua set her free by the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:01:20.880,0:01:24.060
As she was declared free, she was helped to her feet

0:01:24.060,0:01:28.760
and began to rejoice in the freedom that comes from deliverance.

0:01:29.180,0:01:33.380
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:33.380,0:01:36.780
People of God, Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:36.780,0:01:39.820
Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:39.820,0:01:47.120
Thank you. My name is Yvonne Rapati from Johannesburg, South Africa.

0:01:47.120,0:01:51.060
The man standing next to me is my lovely husband, Gideon Rapati.

0:01:51.060,0:01:55.280
He is also from South Africa. Thank you.

0:01:55.280,0:02:04.900
The problem that brought me here was setback and the need for financial breakthrough.

0:02:04.900,0:02:08.840
I didn't know that I had spirits in me.

0:02:08.840,0:02:13.880
But then I was born into a family that worships idols.

0:02:13.880,0:02:19.380
From both families - from my father's side and from my mother's side.

0:02:19.380,0:02:24.520
So, last week I was delivered from all those spirits.

0:02:24.520,0:02:30.660
When Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for the people in the church,

0:02:30.660,0:02:35.980
he came to the altar and prayed for me.

0:02:35.980,0:02:41.680
Oh my God. I didn't know that one day, I would be the one manifesting.

0:02:41.680,0:02:48.220
I used to tell my husband, "When I go to The SCOAN, I will never do such things".

0:02:48.220,0:02:55.660
I was surprised when I was seeing myself manifesting, fighting.

0:02:55.660,0:03:04.060
I thank God that the man of God delivered me from all the spirits.

0:03:04.060,0:03:10.760
The spirit of anger cost me a lot because every time my husband was trying to talk to me,

0:03:10.760,0:03:15.820
was trying to have a conversation with me, I was ready to fight all the time.

0:03:15.820,0:03:18.240
I was ready to defend all the time.

0:03:18.240,0:03:21.360
And I didn't know what I was defending myself for.

0:03:21.360,0:03:28.780
I remember one day, when I went to the hairdresser, my husband came late to fetch me.

0:03:28.780,0:03:31.480
Some other ladies were there.

0:03:31.480,0:03:38.280
They were telling me some issues about my husband, what he was doing there.

0:03:38.280,0:03:44.300
They said that my husband was dating someone in the saloon.

0:03:44.300,0:03:46.540
I just kept quiet.

0:03:46.540,0:03:50.880
When he came to fetch me, we went back to the house.

0:03:50.880,0:03:56.760
When we were driving home, I asked him about this issue. He refused to answer me.

0:03:56.760,0:04:04.320
My God, that spirit of anger came whilst he was driving.

0:04:04.320,0:04:08.800
I don't know what happened, but I jumped.

0:04:08.800,0:04:15.000
I grabbed the steering wheel, I turned the steering wheel while the car was moving.

0:04:15.000,0:04:23.160
He was driving 120 mph, and the car over turned.

0:04:23.160,0:04:30.360
Then, I went for the gun because my husband is a policeman in South Africa.

0:04:30.360,0:04:34.700
What I was trying to reach was a gun.

0:04:34.700,0:04:37.160
The spirit in me wanted me to kill him.

0:04:37.160,0:04:39.560
So I went for the gun.

0:04:39.560,0:04:45.560
When I tried to grab the gun, the gun fell down. So I opened the door.

0:04:45.560,0:04:53.040
My husband just opened the door and ran.

0:04:53.040,0:04:59.060
I grabbed that gun. I left the car there while the ignition was still on.

0:04:59.060,0:05:06.080
So, I just left the car there, in the middle of the road. I went back home

0:05:06.080,0:05:08.800
I was just trekking. I was walking.

0:05:08.800,0:05:13.800
My husband went straight to the police station.

0:05:13.800,0:05:18.320
He went there to report me that I wanted to shoot him.

0:05:18.320,0:05:23.200
Then, the policemen came - there were 4 of them.

0:05:23.200,0:05:27.280
By then I was in the house.

0:05:27.280,0:05:35.180
When they came, I quickly grabbed the gun and pointed the gun at them.

0:05:35.180,0:05:40.600
I said, "If any one of you comes near me, I will show you today. I will shoot you to death".

0:05:40.600,0:05:46.300
So three of them ran; they ran back.

0:05:46.300,0:05:48.380
My husband also ran back.

0:05:48.380,0:05:53.200
One of the policeman came to me. He said, "You know what, sister, please calm down!

0:05:53.200,0:05:56.180
I just want to speak to you. Calm down!"

0:05:56.180,0:06:00.500
So I managed, I don't know how I managed to calm down.

0:06:00.500,0:06:02.860
Then he said to me, "Give me the gun".

0:06:02.860,0:06:08.080
I said, "You know what? Talk whatever you want to talk, I'm not giving you this gun.

0:06:08.080,0:06:12.920
I want to shoot that husband of mine today. I want to kill him today".

0:06:12.920,0:06:19.360
The policeman said to me, "Please put the gun down. Let us speak.

0:06:19.360,0:06:22.760
We are here to speak to you, we are not here to arrest you".

0:06:22.760,0:06:27.600
I managed to give the policeman that gun.

0:06:27.600,0:06:29.560
Then my husband came in.

0:06:29.560,0:06:35.700
Then my husband said to them, "I don't want to talk to her nor to anyone.

0:06:35.700,0:06:39.580
What I'm here for is to take my clothes. I'm moving out of this house".

0:06:39.580,0:06:42.380
I was happy to hear that.

0:06:42.380,0:06:45.640
Then my husband went straight to the bedroom.

0:06:45.640,0:06:50.600
He took all his clothes. Then all of them went away.

0:06:50.600,0:06:56.420
I was just happy to own the house because I was the man of that house.

0:06:56.420,0:07:03.420
I was the one who gave instructions all the time. I was always screaming and fighting.

0:07:03.420,0:07:09.380
I never showed my husband and my children love.

0:07:09.380,0:07:18.740
Especially my ten-year-old daughter. She said that I was always beating her without skipping a day.

0:07:18.740,0:07:22.380
I've got three children.

0:07:22.380,0:07:26.380
The first one is the mother of the other two

0:07:26.380,0:07:31.140
because all the time, when they wanted something, they wouldn't come to me.

0:07:31.140,0:07:35.740
They would go straight to their father, "Father, please give us food. Give us this".

0:07:35.740,0:07:39.780
When they came to me, I would beat them - all of them.

0:07:39.780,0:07:43.860
I was always fighting in the house. I was always causing problems.

0:07:43.860,0:07:47.440
I was looking for problems all the time. I never had peace.

0:07:47.440,0:07:51.220
I never knew that this day, today, would come.

0:07:51.220,0:07:56.180
I never knew that one day I would sit with my husband and we would have a conversation.

0:07:56.180,0:08:00.280
Or sit with my husband and smile at him or talk to him.

0:08:00.280,0:08:05.460
I thank the prophet, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for this day.

0:08:05.460,0:08:09.900
Madam, you said that this spirit made you the man of the house.

0:08:09.900,0:08:13.900
Can you describe the things that you were instructing your husband to do,

0:08:13.900,0:08:16.640
that ordinarily a wife was supposed to do.

0:08:16.640,0:08:19.400
What were some of those things you were pushing him to do?

0:08:19.400,0:08:21.380
As husband and wife...

0:08:21.380,0:08:24.980
When you are staying together, you have to meet as husband and wife.

0:08:24.980,0:08:31.760
But in my house, there were instructions. I would only meet with him when I wanted.

0:08:31.760,0:08:39.040
At my workplace, I work 7 days in, 7 days out.

0:08:39.040,0:08:44.900
When I was working that week, the full seven days he was not allowed to touch me.

0:08:44.900,0:08:47.120
He was not allowed to come near me.

0:08:47.120,0:08:50.280
Every time he would be begging me, "Please come to sleep".

0:08:50.280,0:08:53.480
I would just say, "Okay. Go to sleep. I'm coming right now".

0:08:53.480,0:08:57.660
I would just leave my husband to go to sleep,

0:08:57.660,0:09:06.700
and then around 2:00 am, I would go to bed slowly so that he wouldn't touch me.

0:09:06.700,0:09:13.740
The minute he would wake up and say, "Why are you doing this?", fighting again. I was ready to attack.

0:09:13.740,0:09:17.600
I was always fighting him.

0:09:17.600,0:09:21.360
This spirit has affected my life a lot.

0:09:21.360,0:09:26.020
I didn't even cook in the house. He was the one who was doing the house chores.

0:09:26.020,0:09:30.120
He was the one who was cooking. He was the one who was bathing the children.

0:09:30.120,0:09:34.120
He was the one who was doing everything. I was always tired.

0:09:34.120,0:09:38.720
When he had cooked and I came home from work,

0:09:38.720,0:09:42.300
he would say, "I've already cooked. Just dish up".

0:09:42.300,0:09:48.000
I would say, "Okay. I'm coming right now". I would go straight to the bathroom, take my shower.

0:09:48.000,0:09:50.760
After that - gone!

0:09:50.760,0:09:55.420
I didn't dish up for him. I didn't dish up for my kids.

0:09:55.420,0:09:59.160
So these spirits have affected my life a lot.

0:09:59.160,0:10:04.440
Sister, can you tell us, last week as Prophet T.B. Joshua was moving around...

0:10:04.440,0:10:09.220
You had told your husband that when you come to The SCOAN, you are not going to manifest. Nothing would happen.

0:10:09.220,0:10:14.580
Describe to us what happened last week, as the prophet began to move around and pray for people.

0:10:14.580,0:10:20.780
Okay. When the prophet was touching everyone, I was just look around,

0:10:20.780,0:10:25.780
saying to myself, "These people, I wonder what they are doing - manifesting and doing all that".

0:10:25.780,0:10:29.140
I was just wondering, "What's going on?"

0:10:29.140,0:10:35.620
The minute the prophet came to the altar - I was sitting there at the back of the altar -

0:10:35.620,0:10:38.400
when he came near me, he never even touched me.

0:10:38.400,0:10:47.660
When he came closer, something just came into me, "Run away!". I was just shaking.

0:10:47.660,0:10:53.280
I ran away. I was surprised at seeing everybody around me.

0:10:53.280,0:10:59.020
Everybody was surrounding me. I was just surprised, "What's going on?"

0:10:59.020,0:11:02.560
That was how the evil spirit within our sister was exposed.

0:11:02.560,0:11:06.580
It tried to cause her to run away but the power of God took control as we can see.

0:11:06.580,0:11:10.120
That's how that spirit was confessing what it had caused in her life.

0:11:10.120,0:11:16.880
Tell us, sister, to the glory of God, ever since that touch, what are the changes that you've seen in your life?

0:11:16.880,0:11:22.980
Before that, when Prophet T.B. Joshua was touching everyone,

0:11:22.980,0:11:26.020
when he lifted up his hand - wham!

0:11:26.020,0:11:29.840
I saw something. The hand was very huge!

0:11:29.840,0:11:34.440
When he did 'wham', I said to myself, "I'm not here for this, I'm running away for my life.

0:11:34.440,0:11:38.120
He's going to kill me". That hand was very huge.

0:11:38.120,0:11:46.420
When I looked at him in his eyes, I saw flames. I saw fire in his eyes, so that's why I ran away.

0:11:46.420,0:11:49.500
Ever since that touch...

0:11:49.500,0:11:53.060
I never knew that one day, I would smile at my husband.

0:11:53.060,0:11:58.680
He had never in his life saw me smiling, talking to him nicely.

0:11:58.680,0:12:05.620
It wasn't easy for me to say 'sorry', but since we came to the SCOAN,

0:12:05.620,0:12:12.800
everything he says or every time I've wronged him, I would say, "I'm sorry".

0:12:12.800,0:12:15.620
I thank God for my life. I thank God for this.

0:12:15.620,0:12:19.740
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:19.740,0:12:25.170
This is the confirmation of our sister's deliverance and we all heard what she said earlier.

0:12:25.170,0:12:30.700
She said that even before coming to The SCOAN, she told her husband that if we get there, nothing will happen to me.

0:12:30.700,0:12:36.160
I'm not going to manifest like others. Even as Prophet T.B. Joshua was moving around, she was just observing,

0:12:36.160,0:12:39.300
thinking to herself that nothing would happen, she would never fall.

0:12:39.300,0:12:46.420
But we saw at that touch, everything changed, and that evil spirit was exposed and deliverance came.

0:12:46.420,0:12:49.560
So at this point, we want to listen to your husband - a few words.

0:12:49.560,0:12:54.060
We believe he's in a position to shed more light on the experiences in the past.

0:12:54.060,0:12:59.080
Sir, you're welcome. Please introduce yourself to us.

0:12:59.080,0:13:02.500
Children of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:13:02.500,0:13:05.520
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:13:05.520,0:13:08.780
Indeed, God is with us.

0:13:08.780,0:13:12.900
My name is Mr Gideon Rapati.

0:13:12.900,0:13:20.920
And the beauty standing beside me is my lovely wife, Mrs Yvonne Rapati.

0:13:20.920,0:13:27.560
I am a police officer in South Africa, in my country

0:13:27.560,0:13:33.420
and also a subject matter expert on issues of domestic violence.

0:13:33.420,0:13:38.060
Mr Gideon Rapati
Police Officer, South Africa

0:13:38.060,0:13:45.500
I have been taken away from doing operational duties at the police station in our state,

0:13:45.500,0:13:50.820
and I was taken straight to the training division of the South African police.

0:13:50.820,0:13:58.960
I facilitate exactly this type of intervention - domestic violence learning program -

0:13:58.960,0:14:06.300
to both my colleagues and all the people within my jurisdiction,

0:14:06.300,0:14:10.240
within the cluster that we are serving.

0:14:10.240,0:14:19.080
So, my life feels like a very long life.

0:14:19.080,0:14:30.880
The 12 years that I have spent with my wife feel like 50 years of my life.

0:14:30.880,0:14:35.000
But with the grace of God I endured.

0:14:35.000,0:14:42.200
Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
Deliverance Testimony

0:14:42.200,0:14:48.860
Children of God, I have experienced the life of long-suffering.

0:14:48.860,0:14:56.420
My wife has already said most of the things that I'm going to say.

0:14:56.420,0:15:03.580
When I met my wife, she was very down-to-earth.

0:15:03.580,0:15:10.420
You can see how beautiful she is; any man would want to settle with her.

0:15:10.420,0:15:18.100
We met and within a week's time of knowing each other...

0:15:18.100,0:15:25.340
I was staying in police barracks at a male dormitory,

0:15:25.340,0:15:30.840
where I was not even allowed to bring a woman in.

0:15:30.840,0:15:34.140
But I started sneaking her in.

0:15:34.140,0:15:41.400
Within a month, my wife had already moved in with me in that barracks.

0:15:41.400,0:15:46.200
I had to totally disregard all the visits from the officials

0:15:46.200,0:15:52.860
who frequently came to see if there was anything that we were doing that we were not supposed to do.

0:15:52.860,0:16:00.780
I fell in love with my wife, who was a very good woman then.

0:16:00.780,0:16:12.180
But from there, we started having a little argument there, and fights there.

0:16:12.180,0:16:19.000
We had already moved in together by then, when she said to me,

0:16:19.000,0:16:24.500
"Mr Rapati, I can't stay with you. Where I come from, they would never allow this.

0:16:24.500,0:16:32.600
You must go and introduce yourself. You must go and pay the bride price".

0:16:32.600,0:16:37.660
So everything between my wife and I happened quickly.

0:16:37.660,0:16:43.680
I'm saying the events were happening in a quick succession.

0:16:43.680,0:16:56.060
Personally, I have never really got to know her and her purpose in my life.

0:16:56.060,0:17:00.760
What happened between me and my wife...

0:17:00.760,0:17:06.200
We had our first child; our daughter is now 11 years old.

0:17:06.200,0:17:16.260
Immediately after we had a child together, my wife started calling all the shots.

0:17:16.260,0:17:23.580
I became a puppet. My wife became my puppet master.

0:17:23.580,0:17:35.500
So, she took over. To an extent that I sometimes saw myself as a prisoner but I endured!

0:17:35.500,0:17:39.600
I saw myself like I had self-imprisoned myself

0:17:39.600,0:17:46.980
because something would tell me, "Go! This woman is not the right woman for you".

0:17:46.980,0:17:49.800
Okay, my daughter was still very young then.

0:17:49.800,0:17:56.160
My wife had to go home, from where I was born, a place called Tahu, Northwest.

0:17:56.160,0:18:04.600
She had to go and wean the child there until the child was old enough.

0:18:04.600,0:18:13.400
While she was in town, she befriended with some forces that were against me.

0:18:13.400,0:18:19.340
She even got close to my biological mother.

0:18:19.340,0:18:30.640
Every nonsense that she was told about me precipitated the anger and hatred against me.

0:18:30.640,0:18:35.720
When she came back from home, she never told me the journey from my own hometown.

0:18:35.720,0:18:37.680
She never told me anything.

0:18:37.680,0:18:46.000
But she was living life, suggesting that something bad must have been told to her.

0:18:46.000,0:18:48.560
Like my wife said,

0:18:48.560,0:18:53.500
I would be driving a motor vehicle on a public road,

0:18:53.500,0:18:57.140
my wife would start an argument, a small thing,

0:18:57.140,0:19:01.640
a little thing to her was to become a worst case scenario.

0:19:01.640,0:19:09.720
It would be blown out of proportion, a little thing; even if I tried to calm her down.

0:19:09.720,0:19:13.640
Now, she would be using her physicality.

0:19:13.640,0:19:22.320
I would be driving a car. She would be fighting for the steering wheel while the car was moving.

0:19:22.320,0:19:30.520
She would be struggling to disarm me, to take the firearm from my harness. This is the service pistol!

0:19:30.520,0:19:34.420
I have two firearms. I have a service pistol. I have a private firearm.

0:19:34.420,0:19:40.940
So, I'm always scared - whether I'm at work or not around at home.

0:19:40.940,0:19:43.240
She would be struggling to get possession of my firearm.

0:19:43.240,0:19:46.880
She would say, "Today, I'm going to kill you, you are dead.

0:19:46.880,0:19:50.560
After killing you, I'm going to kill myself".

0:19:50.560,0:19:55.920
She would be opening the car door while the car was in motion,

0:19:55.920,0:19:59.220
trying to jump out of the moving vehicle to commit suicide.

0:19:59.220,0:20:03.680
I said, "Oh my God, now if she jumps out of the moving vehicle,

0:20:03.680,0:20:07.280
it means the family, my in-laws will be pinning her death on me.

0:20:07.280,0:20:09.880
They won't see it as a suicide".

0:20:09.880,0:20:15.140
But I thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua because I prayed when I left my country.

0:20:15.140,0:20:21.520
I said, "God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I know you will vindicate me in all this".

0:20:21.520,0:20:27.480
Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
Deliverance Testimony

0:20:27.480,0:20:31.980
Indeed, children of God, as I'm standing here right now,

0:20:31.980,0:20:38.420
I feel I have got my freedom. I'm a free man now.

0:20:38.420,0:20:45.620
But my wife, who was manifesting - I know that demons were the ones who put me through long suffering.

0:20:45.620,0:20:50.100
The beauty standing here was not responsible; it was a demon.

0:20:50.100,0:20:57.920
Because this coward called demon, he does not come in one form.

0:20:57.920,0:21:01.680
He has so many forms; because he's a coward, he can't show himself.

0:21:01.680,0:21:06.440
He can use any form to come and mesmerize somebody's life.

0:21:06.440,0:21:12.520
It is true. My wife was always in a mood of fighting.

0:21:12.520,0:21:14.200
Five minutes!

0:21:14.200,0:21:21.360
I could never sit down with my wife, discuss anything pertaining to the household or the children.

0:21:21.360,0:21:26.780
Five minutes was enough, then she would just snap out of the blue.

0:21:26.780,0:21:30.380
She would be pointing fingers. She would become aggressive.

0:21:30.380,0:21:34.440
Even if I was trying to reason with her, my wife would be telling me,

0:21:34.440,0:21:37.420
"I'm not going to sit down and listen to this shit".

0:21:37.420,0:21:40.200
Telling me this straight to my face.

0:21:40.200,0:21:45.740
Remember this was the woman who would even want to pull my manhood.

0:21:45.740,0:21:52.700
I would be driving the car. She would then grab me in the front.

0:21:52.700,0:21:57.040
She would be beating me, using the palm of the hand, hit me hard try to take the firearm.

0:21:57.040,0:22:03.080
I would try to tend to the vehicle so that the vehicle wouldn't just go awry, with no control.

0:22:03.080,0:22:10.920
This was a woman who always accused me of cheating on her.

0:22:10.920,0:22:16.940
It is very painful when somebody accuses you of cheating, and yet, you know you're not cheating.

0:22:16.940,0:22:25.400
My wife would tell me straight, "You can pack your bags and go back to your ex", calling her by name.

0:22:25.400,0:22:29.800
She would even go to the extent of describing my ex.

0:22:29.800,0:22:37.280
Even before she met her, she would be describing how nice and caring she is.

0:22:37.280,0:22:41.020
There is no word my wife hasn't said to me.

0:22:41.020,0:22:43.900
Ugly words that will never go back.

0:22:43.900,0:22:48.200
You know, it is good now. I'm in the arena of liberty!

0:22:48.200,0:22:53.940
During my stay here, I have learned a lot about the art of forgiving.

0:22:53.940,0:22:59.100
To speak forgiveness, you are doing it for God, all glory goes to God.

0:22:59.100,0:23:06.100
Now, there is a confession that I want to make in this church.

0:23:06.100,0:23:15.000
The confession will shock my sisters and my brother at home in South Africa.

0:23:15.000,0:23:20.980
I didn't grow up with them. My mother gave me away when I was three months old.

0:23:20.980,0:23:27.220
She gave me to my aunt to raise me, so I grew up knowing my aunt as my mother.

0:23:27.220,0:23:36.540
I was perplexed when I turned 16 or 17 and people told me, "No, your mother is actually that one".

0:23:36.540,0:23:44.260
My mother did not give me away for any other reason than that she was struggling in life.

0:23:44.260,0:23:46.600
It was not deliberate.

0:23:46.600,0:23:51.720
So, when I came back home to join my real family,

0:23:51.720,0:23:59.700
some of my relatives just wanted to make me feel unwelcomed.

0:23:59.700,0:24:02.140
My heart was where I grew up.

0:24:02.140,0:24:09.640
So, when my wife was weaning the child at home,

0:24:09.640,0:24:16.400
I didn't know if my mom wanted to become frank or friendly to my wife (or not).

0:24:16.400,0:24:22.220
My mom told my wife that I had a sexually transmitted disease.

0:24:22.220,0:24:24.700
They call it 'drop' at home.

0:24:24.700,0:24:32.320
My wife never told me anything (about that conversation).

0:24:32.320,0:24:39.500
But whenever we finished having bedroom fun, she would jump up and go to clean herself.

0:24:39.500,0:24:44.920
I didn't know why. She would lie and say it's her culture. It's a culture thing from where she comes from.

0:24:44.920,0:24:49.820
Not knowing that she was cleaning herself up, so I couldn't infect her.

0:24:49.820,0:24:52.260
I met her six years later.

0:24:52.260,0:24:54.480
South Africa has the best hospitals.

0:24:54.480,0:24:59.080
I was cured of everything; I was clean.

0:24:59.080,0:25:08.500
One day, she told me it's my mom and my other relatives, that I am not going to mention, who told her.

0:25:08.500,0:25:13.580
I went to the hardware store and bought an axe!

0:25:13.580,0:25:20.460
I took it to those who do welding works to sharpen it. It was sharpened.

0:25:20.460,0:25:25.660
What I intended to do with the axe was to go home to attack my mother,

0:25:25.660,0:25:29.940
take a rope and hang myself, and my life would be finished.

0:25:29.940,0:25:34.180
Because I couldn't keep any women because of their interference.

0:25:34.180,0:25:40.780
But I have since forgiven my mother. After this I said, "I cannot do this to my mother because of a woman.

0:25:40.780,0:25:47.560
I cannot go to the extreme of doing that to my own mother. I have to forgive my mother.

0:25:47.560,0:25:49.700
I have to be friends with my mother".

0:25:49.700,0:25:56.620
I started experiencing a lot of love from my own mother. That was what unsettled my wife.

0:25:56.620,0:26:00.760
That was what made my wife accusing me of one thing or another.

0:26:00.760,0:26:02.980
Those things that I was not doing.

0:26:02.980,0:26:10.520
I found myself in an environment where I was reduced to a mere wife at home.

0:26:10.520,0:26:15.600
My wife works a twelve hour shift. I work only an eight hour shift.

0:26:15.600,0:26:21.820
So I'm the one who gets home early. I would be the one doing all the chores.

0:26:21.820,0:26:30.260
I would bathe the younger one, and I would help the other two to take their own baths.

0:26:30.260,0:26:38.820
I played the part of a mom, to an extent that my children saw me as a mother.

0:26:38.820,0:26:45.380
When I went to fetch my wife from work, my children would pass my wife, even if she was right in front of me.

0:26:45.380,0:26:47.180
My children would pass her and come to embrace me.

0:26:47.180,0:26:49.480
My children have the culture of hugging me.

0:26:49.480,0:26:55.120
All three of them would advance to me, pass their mother and come to embrace me.

0:26:55.120,0:27:01.520
Their mother would be saying, "Ah, they love you more than me". It's like there is no issue then.

0:27:01.520,0:27:05.600
Since I met my wife, one thing needs to be mentioned,

0:27:05.600,0:27:11.040
I experienced a lot of motor vehicle accidents.

0:27:11.040,0:27:15.640
Two with her. We cheated death.

0:27:15.640,0:27:23.320
Hitting a cattle - the two of us seated in the front - but the cattle flew over and I thank God for that.

0:27:23.320,0:27:34.400
I told myself that selling my car to pay for the trip to come to The SCOAN is worth while.

0:27:34.400,0:27:42.280
I told myself that the day I go, my problems will be things of the past.

0:27:42.280,0:27:47.820
A week prior to our trip to The SCOAN.

0:27:47.820,0:27:51.720
I never slept in the same room with my wife.

0:27:51.720,0:27:58.840
She was sleeping in the main bedroom. I was sleeping in my son's bedroom.

0:27:58.840,0:28:05.920
Before we came, on the same day that we had to depart from South Africa, my wife packed her bags.

0:28:05.920,0:28:07.920
There was no big argument.

0:28:07.920,0:28:16.340
She said she's leaving to go and cool herself off at her sister's place in another province.

0:28:16.340,0:28:21.180
Now, what I'm saying to the people of God, in general,

0:28:21.180,0:28:26.800
if a demon is involved, you won't see it, it does not come face to face with you.

0:28:26.800,0:28:29.420
My life experienced a downslope.

0:28:29.420,0:28:37.480
Financially, before I met her, I was able to pay my accounts. I was able to run my life.

0:28:37.480,0:28:41.940
When she came into my life, everything went down slope.

0:28:41.940,0:28:49.260
I am now in the deepest financial quagmire with a lot of financial institutions in South Africa.

0:28:49.260,0:28:51.200
And she also.

0:28:51.200,0:28:55.320
Because we live our lives on borrowed money. We live on credit.

0:28:55.320,0:28:58.220
So, brother, we want to find out from you now about

0:28:58.220,0:29:02.680
when you came and the man of God prayed for your wife.

0:29:02.680,0:29:05.380
Just tell us, when he prayed for your wife, what happened?

0:29:05.380,0:29:11.560
And ever since that day, what are the changes that you've seen in her and your life?

0:29:11.560,0:29:17.740
When the man of God prayed for my wife - in me, there was a mixed reaction of feelings.

0:29:17.740,0:29:25.360
I was overwhelmed. Something said to me, I must advance to the altar and claim that she's my wife.

0:29:25.360,0:29:31.120
But because of the order and organization in this place, I had to stay on my seat.

0:29:31.120,0:29:39.180
I was very happy because the fullness of light was now approaching the darkness,

0:29:39.180,0:29:45.900
that is why you saw my wife running away, because of her darkness.

0:29:45.900,0:29:49.260
Ever since then, you have been together for one week now.

0:29:49.260,0:29:53.300
What are the changes that you've seen in your life and marriage?

0:29:53.300,0:30:00.100
I have seen this beauty next to me falling in love with me all over again.

0:30:00.100,0:30:06.600
Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
Deliverance Testimony

0:30:06.600,0:30:13.560
Now since my wife's deliverance, she's smiling back at me.

0:30:13.560,0:30:17.380
We are having civil, decent conversations.

0:30:17.380,0:30:21.260
We are even planning the life in Christ together.

0:30:21.260,0:30:31.440
That when we leave here, when we go back to our country, we are going to reflect Jesus Christ in us.

0:30:31.440,0:30:42.920
Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
Deliverance Testimony

0:30:42.920,0:30:47.800
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for this reconciliation!

0:30:47.800,0:30:53.100
You mean to say that now the affection is restored, you're now able to love your wife

0:30:53.100,0:30:58.980
and she's able to love you, something that has been missing from this marriage for 12 years?

0:30:58.980,0:31:03.600
All those things have come to bow down to the name Jesus.

0:31:03.600,0:31:06.380
Let me tell you something, children of God

0:31:06.380,0:31:09.760
This is my experience.

0:31:09.760,0:31:17.040
I would be enduring that long-suffering, not knowing that I only had to run to one man called Jesus Christ.

0:31:17.040,0:31:26.560
At work, my colleagues and my friends, I didn't know that when I approached them to seek advice,

0:31:26.560,0:31:33.780
immediately after I had left, they would make a meal out of it.

0:31:33.780,0:31:37.640
I would become breakfast, lunch and supper for them.

0:31:37.640,0:31:42.260
I would become a laughingstock, a joke and everything you can think of.

0:31:42.260,0:31:49.100
I didn't know that all my problems, all I had to do was to take them to Jesus Christ

0:31:49.100,0:31:52.680
because He said, all your burdens are My burdens.

0:31:52.680,0:31:55.800
Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:31:55.800,0:31:57.660
We give glory to God once again,

0:31:57.660,0:32:02.860
and finally, sir, what is your advice to our viewers around the world?

0:32:02.860,0:32:04.630
Alright.

0:32:04.630,0:32:11.360
Viewers, I stand in front of you to declare and to decree to you that

0:32:11.360,0:32:18.020
there is only one Man who can bring solutions to your life.

0:32:18.020,0:32:25.360
Like I have said, don't seek advice. Don't even narrate your own life to anybody.

0:32:25.360,0:32:29.700
Everything! Hardships, setbacks and everything!

0:32:29.700,0:32:35.160
Whether you are fighting with your wife. Whether your marital life is not a bed full of roses.

0:32:35.160,0:32:43.060
Run to God because God will never laugh at your problem.

0:32:43.060,0:32:45.400
Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!

0:32:45.400,0:32:52.920
Just finally from our sister, your final word of advice to our viewers around the world.

0:32:52.920,0:32:58.700
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:32:58.700,0:33:03.480
Thank You, Jesus.

0:33:03.480,0:33:10.140
The advice for people all over the world is that

0:33:10.140,0:33:16.660
when you are facing some challenges with your husband,

0:33:16.660,0:33:22.340
don't go to traditional healers, they don't have a solution.

0:33:22.340,0:33:24.160
I know it from my own experience

0:33:24.160,0:33:29.800
because I was going from one traditional healer to another.

0:33:29.800,0:33:35.900
You would pay. I didn't mind to pay 3000 or 5000.

0:33:35.900,0:33:39.060
What they would do to your body - hey!

0:33:39.060,0:33:45.580
They would cut your body all over; you would think that cutting your body was the solution.

0:33:45.580,0:33:52.740
I didn't know that they were putting a lot of spirits in my body to see myself as a man.

0:33:52.740,0:33:54.900
So what I am saying now is that

0:33:54.900,0:34:00.400
you know when you go from one traditional healer to another,

0:34:00.400,0:34:04.160
I was experiencing a lot of things, I was seeing things

0:34:04.160,0:34:07.680
without my husband telling me or anyone telling me.

0:34:07.680,0:34:12.140
I would tell him, "You are doing this, you are doing that".

0:34:12.140,0:34:17.360
I would find out that those things were true. And no one had to tell me about those things.

0:34:17.360,0:34:22.060
I was just dreaming it. It's because of devil, it's because of satan.

0:34:22.060,0:34:27.660
Satan was giving me all those dreams. So that I had to keep on fighting, keep on fighting.

0:34:27.660,0:34:36.400
Men all over the world, be supportive to your wife. Thank you!
