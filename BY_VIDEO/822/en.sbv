God is still saying something.

On Sunday May 7th 2017, during The SCOAN Live
Sunday Service, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a

0:00:13.930,0:00:21.130
prophecy concerning the outcome of the 2017
French Presidential Election, shortly before

0:00:21.130,0:00:25.020
the results were officially announced.

0:00:25.020,0:00:28.720
These were his words:

0:00:28.720,0:00:33.200
“In Jesus Christ’s name we pray.

0:00:33.200,0:00:38.340
Give thanks to God.

0:00:38.340,0:00:43.950
There is so much uproar in the French speaking
country.

0:00:43.950,0:00:46.910
We look at the two candidates.

0:00:46.910,0:00:56.920
For me, immigrants, refugees--- Because my
Father in Heaven was once a refugee too.

0:00:56.920,0:01:03.980
So, we pray for any one of them who supports
refugees – like Emmanuel Macron.

0:01:03.980,0:01:09.760
We are praying for him and our prayer will
answer!

0:01:09.760,0:01:12.000
I will leave it; I will not say more than that.

0:01:12.000,0:01:17.000
It is prayer that will put him there, not
anything –

0:01:17.000,0:01:21.040
because of his heart for refugees and immigrants.

0:01:21.040,0:01:24.480
Half of this world are immigrants and refugees.

0:01:24.480,0:01:27.840
Where will they go?

0:01:27.880,0:01:36.759
I pray every day for Emmanuel Macron -
 I am not a politician - because of what he believes.

0:01:36.759,0:01:40.579
What he believes is what my Father in Heaven
believes.

0:01:40.579,0:01:44.189
We will see what we can do to protect these
refugees and immigrants.

0:01:44.189,0:01:48.600
Many of them – it is not their will to leave
their country; it is war.

0:01:48.600,0:01:54.200
When there is war, you run helter-skelter
– anywhere you know you can run to.

0:01:54.200,0:01:57.640
We know there are some bad people among the
refugees.

0:01:57.640,0:02:06.240
But we cannot say because there are some bad
people that we reject all of them.

0:02:15.940,0:02:18.540
I am not saying you should pray for him.

0:02:18.540,0:02:27.240
Me – I am praying for him, Emmanuel Macron,
because of what he believes.

0:02:27.240,0:02:36.319
I listened to his profile – his belief about
refugees and immigrants.

0:02:36.319,0:02:37.519
Today is declaration.

0:02:37.520,0:02:43.140
I am praying, not you; I am not saying you because we are not playing politics in the Church.”

0:02:43.140,0:02:45.240
That is just what I believe; thank you.
