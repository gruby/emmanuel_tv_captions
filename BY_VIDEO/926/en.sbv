Emmanuel! God is with us! My name is salami D. And my name is Justin.

0:00:09.860,0:00:15.240
Viewers all over the world, we welcome you to today's episode of changing lives.

0:00:15.240,0:00:23.580
In this program we are going to take you beyond the testimony to the heart of how life was and how life is,

0:00:23.580,0:00:28.960
after an encounter with Jesus Christ through the Ministry of Prophet TB Joshua.

0:00:28.960,0:00:36.800
Yes, throughout human history we have seen that those who bless God in their trials will be blessed by God through their trials and

0:00:36.800,0:00:42.840
through this interview we will listen to people's real-life trials how they responded how they overcame through God

0:00:42.840,0:00:48.500
And why they are rejoicing in the Lord today, and why you too can. Yes and today,

0:00:48.500,0:00:53.140
we will have the pleasure of speaking with the Ipusu's.

0:00:53.140,0:01:00.400
Their experience of marriage had been a difficult one that would rub the faith of almost everyone.

0:01:00.400,0:01:06.600
Today, God's grace has united them with the unshakable peace and love.

0:01:06.600,0:01:12.560
Their incredible journey, along the highway of marriage, seemed to end even before it had begun.

0:01:12.560,0:01:16.820
Not knowing that the challenges and the trials they were going through in their

0:01:16.820,0:01:21.480
relationship were only the tip of the iceberg. Their story is an eye

0:01:21.480,0:01:26.760
opener to the real cause of why many marriages don't work out today;

0:01:26.760,0:01:34.880
ultimately leading to divorce and how the bitter taste of life's trouble can be replaced with the sweetness of God's grace.

0:01:34.880,0:01:39.840
So be blessed as you join us in Jesus name. So, here, with us on changing lives,

0:01:39.840,0:01:42.680
we have our special guests with us here today.

0:01:42.680,0:01:48.360
Mr.. And Mrs. Ipisu's. You're very welcome. How are you today?

0:01:48.360,0:01:56.220
Fantastic so we'll start off with Dosu Ipisu. Can you introduce yourself to us and share with us your wonderful  testimony.

0:01:56.220,0:02:02.140
Thank you very much. My name is Dosu Ipisuper

0:02:02.140,0:02:10.100
My testimony is about how I had lost affection for my husband and my experiences before and after my marriage

0:02:10.100,0:02:15.080
And then tracing back, before I got marriage: what you hear about marriage is

0:02:15.080,0:02:20.640
more like something smooths, the bed of roses,

0:02:20.640,0:02:24.960
fun fair, you know. How many stories you hear about people getting married.

0:02:24.960,0:02:29.320
How do they go for honeymoon and that was a dream for me as a young lady.

0:02:29.320,0:02:35.020
And then I met my husband, Mr Peter. He came along. We dated.

0:02:35.020,0:02:39.720
We had fun times up to the moment he said he wanted to marry me.

0:02:39.720,0:02:42.560
That was pic of hell in my life because

0:02:42.560,0:02:47.980
at that moment, he irritated me so much. I hated him more.

0:02:47.980,0:02:54.560
You know, he disgusted me. That's all I understood. At some point, I told him that why it must only be me.

0:02:54.560,0:03:00.140
What is so special about me. And I had a lot of psychological problems.

0:03:00.140,0:03:03.420
Thinking "why is this happening to me and all of that?''

0:03:03.420,0:03:09.420
And then I related to my parents and they told me that I should keep up with it. He's a good man.

0:03:09.420,0:03:16.800
Why not go a head and  I told them :  I don't have affection so how do I live with somebody that I don't love?

0:03:16.800,0:03:22.200
They keep telling me that love grows by the day. I told them let me back off from there now.

0:03:22.200,0:03:25.620
And hope that it comes on better.

0:03:25.620,0:03:28.480
But ,you know, it got more difficult.

0:03:28.480,0:03:33.680
Then just three days to my traditional marriage ,

0:03:33.680,0:03:36.240
I told him bluntly I'm not

0:03:36.240,0:03:41.400
going to marry him. Then my mom heard this she was like:'' oh my daughter, please,

0:03:41.400,0:03:44.880
you know, this is a dream for every mother to see her child get married.

0:03:44.880,0:03:50.300
And in my own case, I told her:'' for any reason whatsoever if you give him your consent;

0:03:50.300,0:03:52.720
then you're going in for the marriage".

0:03:52.720,0:03:57.540
So I related to him: you young man, I am not getting married to you.

0:03:57.540,0:04:03.700
I told him that bluntly and that's not easy  to digest, you know! Three days to your marriage. It goes well.

0:04:03.700,0:04:10.500
He's going for the traditional marriage so, whether or not I come there it should be it fine,

0:04:10.500,0:04:13.560
get married if not he will walk away.

0:04:13.560,0:04:17.440
And so I fought that through until the day of our traditional marriage.

0:04:17.440,0:04:23.240
I finally got married against my will, anyway, I just did that out of play, jokes...

0:04:23.240,0:04:26.820
to just please my parents and

0:04:26.820,0:04:28.520
let peace be.

0:04:28.520,0:04:31.600
And so I felt okay, after the marriage

0:04:31.600,0:04:37.820
I will experience some peace, maybe, just like my father promised that love will come and will grow by the day.

0:04:37.820,0:04:44.580
We will get to do things that would get me into... but that never happened.

0:04:44.580,0:04:49.080
It will shock you to know that it got worse my dear.

0:04:49.080,0:04:52.120
Just seeing him, it would irritate me.

0:04:52.120,0:04:58.540
His sight's structure, I hated it.  You with this pot-bellied where are you going too.

0:04:58.540,0:05:02.900
With stuff like that, and then he added it up with drinking.

0:05:02.900,0:05:08.000
He made it worse because I couldn't stand the odour.

0:05:08.000,0:05:15.940
He always stinks when he comes around. And in that kind of mood, he wants to crab jokes with me.

0:05:15.940,0:05:21.640
I never found anything funny. Even though he did his best. He would buy gifts when coming back home.

0:05:21.640,0:05:27.820
I didn't give into that kind, whether he gave me diamond, it didn't count. You know, I just wanted him to stay away.

0:05:27.820,0:05:33.860
Like this is a new marriage, you would like your husband around. He's not around you will miss him, you're

0:05:33.860,0:05:38.820
calling him. " Where are you? I didn't . In fact, it was fun for me when he was out. I had a great time  when he

0:05:38.820,0:05:42.000
wasn't at home. So that went on

0:05:42.000,0:05:46.200
until, we start moving around, looking for solutions.

0:05:46.200,0:05:51.500
We felt everything wasn't just normal. We went to prayer houses,

0:05:51.500,0:05:55.620
we went,  at his own side, he went to herbalists houses.

0:05:55.620,0:05:59.120
And then he came back telling me. Oh you are possessed.

0:05:59.120,0:06:06.220
They told me that" you're possessed with a spirit husband, and it's because you are possessed".

0:06:06.220,0:06:12.860
that's why, even at my workplace things are not moving or well for me. It's because you are possessed

0:06:12.860,0:06:17.100
that is why my car broke down, my business is not moving well.

0:06:17.100,0:06:20.540
And for your information, you will not have children.

0:06:20.540,0:06:27.540
More, so, reality will soon dawn on you.  I'm quoting him now. "You know, he told me reality will soon dawn on you".

0:06:27.540,0:06:33.420
And then I taught myself, what  am I doing in this place? Of what use am I in this place?

0:06:33.420,0:06:38.700
I am a woman who is not going to have kids. Your certificate  will not get you anything.

0:06:38.700,0:06:45.180
I mean, I'm causing more trouble than good in this place, so I better excuse myself.

0:06:45.180,0:06:49.420
Being who he is I knew that I couldn't live that marriage,

0:06:49.420,0:06:53.860
when he was around.  I mean any time he was at home with me.

0:06:53.860,0:06:58.940
I could not live and so I took my time.

0:06:58.940,0:07:02.640
I was monitoring properly, and I knew exactly

0:07:02.640,0:07:05.580
when I was going to hit this.

0:07:05.580,0:07:10.300
You know. I just knew exactly when he was going to go out. How many hours he would have to spent?

0:07:10.300,0:07:19.360
wherever he went and it was on a Sunday. I had arranged with people out there, to come and pack my things.

0:07:19.360,0:07:25.860
When he went out I brought a vehicle. I packed each and everything. I mean

0:07:25.860,0:07:32.240
to the very last pin, I brought in to do my part, and that was my attention never to return.

0:07:32.240,0:07:35.740
What the am I coming back to do in this house?

0:07:35.740,0:07:40.520
When I'm not bringing any joy, I was not a fulfilled woman, not a satisfied woman.

0:07:40.520,0:07:43.840
So what was the reason for staying in the house?

0:07:43.840,0:07:50.940
So I packed with the intention of never  coming back to the house.

0:07:50.940,0:07:57.560
I didn't give any room whatsoever for conversation. I mean that no chance for him to call me.

0:07:57.560,0:08:03.740
Just not occur to me cope I didn't give in at me if you called me if I when I left the house of

0:08:03.740,0:08:08.660
Up to two months, I didn't pick his calls.

0:08:08.660,0:08:10.860
You know I have that capacity.

0:08:11.000,0:08:16.840
Just when I want to do it, I do it properly. He  would call me,  I saw those calls.

0:08:16.840,0:08:23.800
At times, I blocked him from calling m, some times, I  doing some favor by letting the phone ring why don't peek?

0:08:24.400,0:08:27.060
You sent text messages that day my phone

0:08:27.090,0:08:31.590
I never replied to one you know there were there wasn't any form of

0:08:32.020,0:08:35.759
Communication was ever that was because I didn't want any resolution

0:08:36.450,0:08:41.150
And then my parents want to donate. Chip in I told them hey

0:08:41.940,0:08:48.200
Enough is enough. I had this before getting into the marriage and it cost me this pain so

0:08:49.140,0:08:53.629
What what do you think whatever advice you're giving me now do me any good

0:08:54.630,0:08:57.590
And so it it looked like I was

0:08:58.320,0:09:00.320
Getting too stubborn

0:09:00.660,0:09:02.660
Nobody could approach me

0:09:02.730,0:09:06.439
but then again, I felt I should take my time and

0:09:07.440,0:09:09.440
sick for God's face and

0:09:09.990,0:09:13.280
Then I'll know the will of God for my own marriage

0:09:14.310,0:09:20.929
I've gone to many churches of course. It's not like didn't pray for me of course. It did the best I could

0:09:21.570,0:09:25.160
But then I didn't get the expected results

0:09:25.800,0:09:30.679
Didn't I didn't get good years. I and for so I said I

0:09:31.200,0:09:35.540
Will give one last Trier and that place is the single God Church of All Nations?

0:09:38.550,0:09:40.550
Not because I was coming to look

0:09:40.740,0:09:44.690
Was sick for Prophet TB Joshua. No he's ma'am what I like myself

0:09:45.240,0:09:47.570
But I was coming too sick for that God

0:09:48.090,0:09:49.950
he dies using

0:09:49.950,0:09:51.950
multi I

0:09:52.020,0:09:58.579
Said this to my husband. Oh well finally I picked up my call. I told him for any reason whatsoever

0:09:59.430,0:10:04.460
If we are to combat together inking then we have one last mission together

0:10:05.370,0:10:11.150
Which is to travel down to Singapore Church of All Nations and by any chance we get there?

0:10:11.790,0:10:12.990
and

0:10:12.990,0:10:18.470
I don't get delivered to the points where our experience changes myself

0:10:19.290,0:10:21.290
I'll make my marriage better

0:10:22.320,0:10:25.040
Then issue count ourselves

0:10:25.770,0:10:28.460
divorced and then again, I said

0:10:29.280,0:10:33.619
If I'm up what shown to me the man of God I would like to find out from him what?

0:10:34.140,0:10:39.590
Is the will of God about this marriage because I remember he says

0:10:40.440,0:10:42.710
always that in whatever situation

0:10:43.350,0:10:46.129
You are going through God is still saying so

0:10:46.810,0:10:48.640
And as a good Christian

0:10:48.640,0:10:54.150
Surely seek to know what is God's opinion about the situation that was only reason

0:10:54.310,0:10:57.750
Why we had to come together and travel together talk together

0:10:58.870,0:11:02.039
Just do all of those were cared to us

0:11:02.590,0:11:07.229
Just commit to synagogue. It wasn't because I love you. No it wasn't any of those

0:11:07.230,0:11:11.400
I knew what I wanted and all of that of those

0:11:12.040,0:11:14.700
You might look at it. Did the wedges you know?

0:11:15.460,0:11:22.979
plastic makeup kind of things just to come to Synagogue Church of All Nations and to God be the glory I

0:11:24.010,0:11:26.700
Think I would simply sing cause time is the best

0:11:27.640,0:11:34.830
You know even Aquinas, and I'll go we'll see cost time is the best time at time doesn't matter so I'll simply see

0:11:35.560,0:11:37.890
God met me this time I came

0:11:38.590,0:11:45.989
And finally I was privileged to be prayed for by the man of course so yeah after you were married

0:11:46.750,0:11:53.130
It got to a point in your marriage where you decided to separate for how long were you separated

0:11:54.100,0:12:00.750
Before you decided that synagogue was the last bus stop that you seek the face of God at the synagogue Church of All Nations for

0:12:00.880,0:12:02.860
pray

0:12:02.860,0:12:09.270
By the we were married by December with three years in a marriage, and I left the marriage

0:12:10.570,0:12:12.340
empress extent

0:12:12.340,0:12:16.439
the came here this month, so it's it's about five months I

0:12:17.200,0:12:19.000
separated from the marriage

0:12:19.000,0:12:23.489
and then when I came here, I was privileged to be touched by the man of God like I said and

0:12:24.130,0:12:25.570
that

0:12:25.570,0:12:26.710
touch

0:12:26.710,0:12:30.689
Is that the actually while - I did manifest it?

0:12:31.360,0:12:34.500
You know I just knew that something was speaking through me

0:12:35.260,0:12:41.369
But I couldn't control it you know. I I really didn't want to act out we you know, but I couldn't control it and it

0:12:42.370,0:12:43.480
manifested

0:12:43.480,0:12:50.400
Eventually I go deliver, and I went back my husband who was prayed for and after then you know

0:12:51.010,0:12:52.750
unlike before

0:12:52.750,0:12:55.890
That I don't want him around completely

0:12:57.040,0:13:03.359
Right now me seemed like just when he steps out like hey boy. Where are you you know him to come back?

0:13:03.750,0:13:09.000
What's he doing? I want to be involved. You know every step of the way like I now care

0:13:09.000,0:13:14.309
I now have something to discuss with him. It wasn't like that before

0:13:14.820,0:13:19.890
Like he brings up sis gist and I'm like work out right don't you have something better to say?

0:13:20.800,0:13:23.280
You know I would be like

0:13:23.980,0:13:25.980
What's that?

0:13:26.230,0:13:33.540
How do I relate to these things you were saying, so I I never I never enjoyed his conversations his jokes

0:13:33.820,0:13:36.239
His gifts, you know he's and I was who

0:13:36.760,0:13:37.840
was

0:13:37.840,0:13:42.929
Boy with so much of those kids so him is there's so much by never valued it

0:13:43.270,0:13:48.629
after the prayer and it need to think if those I appreciated his efforts I

0:13:49.180,0:13:53.190
Acknowledged that she loved me. You know I felt somebody cared for me

0:13:53.190,0:13:58.080
I felt loved I was I felt some satisfaction in me you know even though

0:13:58.690,0:14:03.030
They see some hitches there of course. It's not a bed of roses

0:14:03.640,0:14:09.059
It's life generally and that goes for everybody every relationship. It's not always smooth

0:14:09.060,0:14:14.429
you always have those patches along the way, but then you know after that prayer I

0:14:15.250,0:14:21.239
Saw those problems in a different light and then my approach to them was also different

0:14:21.760,0:14:24.210
Unlike before you know it brought us

0:14:25.210,0:14:30.629
Troubles give me headaches, give me cause to worry what am I doing? It is well now?

0:14:30.630,0:14:36.570
I now realize that it's not him who is a problem. I'm sure this is happening order homes, too

0:14:36.820,0:14:42.510
You have those problems of quarantine you don't evoke really always arguing

0:14:42.940,0:14:49.260
You always irritated. You don't know if your husband may hear, and maybe the feel is normal. I'm

0:14:49.780,0:14:53.970
Here to tell them to the eats is not normal. It's not a normal about it

0:14:53.970,0:14:59.910
There's something wrong somewhere and your husband or your wife is not the problem no deeper

0:15:00.700,0:15:02.700
You would find

0:15:02.710,0:15:10.259
who is engineering all of this and fights that element else you'll be fighting the wrong battle and

0:15:10.870,0:15:12.490
you will never

0:15:12.490,0:15:17.400
Be victorious, I did today and because it almost happened to me

0:15:17.400,0:15:20.309
You know it ought not to almost wrecked my marriage

0:15:20.800,0:15:26.099
But now you know I now know how to approach it better in the light of God

0:15:26.740,0:15:33.930
To see that it is the enemy who is putting up these ads through him. You know just don't want Mitch

0:15:33.960,0:15:36.749
he has just simply come to steal my joy and

0:15:38.620,0:15:44.310
Make him make me feel like he's not what's it? What the hell am I doing with him? It's not him

0:15:44.550,0:15:50.640
It's the enemy who does not want my happiness who does not want us to enjoy it in marriage who does not want us to?

0:15:50.640,0:15:57.960
Leave a Christ Ward life because he knows that when he disables you where your mind is not at rest

0:15:58.780,0:15:59.710
We are no more

0:15:59.710,0:16:03.780
Happy within you because your heart is your prayer room

0:16:04.000,0:16:09.450
As soon as it disturb Eliza's your heart it gets you thinking it gets you

0:16:09.490,0:16:13.229
You know doing some some weird things that you know supposed to do

0:16:13.780,0:16:15.899
He knows that as soon as it does that

0:16:17.350,0:16:19.200
He has distorted your prayer life

0:16:19.200,0:16:24.419
And so you can be able to fight back rather you see the man or the woman as the problem

0:16:25.210,0:16:27.599
so now after that touch I

0:16:29.470,0:16:31.300
Deliverable thoughts how

0:16:31.300,0:16:36.479
how to handle my problems in the light of God yeah, okay, so

0:16:37.330,0:16:39.330
Looking back now. Can you now say?

0:16:39.970,0:16:43.830
Maybe you've now regretted do things your own way then

0:16:44.620,0:16:46.620
Remember you did so many things

0:16:47.050,0:16:49.050
Hot that'll be home, yeah

0:16:49.240,0:16:52.979
But later on you now, thought okay? Yes, you need to see the face of God

0:16:53.800,0:16:55.800
Looking back now. I

0:16:56.440,0:17:03.210
Wouldn't see I regret exactly not because I'm a Christian I would no have challenges

0:17:03.210,0:17:05.670
Or I will not have time petitions in fact

0:17:06.250,0:17:09.989
When those temptations come rather that just renting me

0:17:10.780,0:17:12.780
because one of God sees our

0:17:13.420,0:17:14.750
feet

0:17:14.750,0:17:16.880
Is tested upon the soil of?

0:17:17.280,0:17:24.649
Troubles trials and it flourishes upon that soil and so for a Christian that I taught I used to be

0:17:26.459,0:17:28.549
God won't count that as a mystic

0:17:29.160,0:17:34.939
Because I've come back to him to seek his face if I'd remain in

0:17:35.340,0:17:37.699
Diverse was suppression like I did

0:17:38.370,0:17:40.290
Then I'll be condemned

0:17:40.290,0:17:45.259
But I thank God for the Holy Spirit that also reminded me that that is not my place

0:17:45.510,0:17:49.369
The devil is all is trying to shift me away from my son ship

0:17:49.370,0:17:56.870
He's trying to shift maybe from my city and God's presence, and so I I simply bless God for bringing me back home

0:17:56.930,0:17:59.509
I call it back home because I

0:18:00.030,0:18:04.879
Wonder. What would have happened if I didn't come back and then again

0:18:04.880,0:18:11.180
I wonder how I would have known if this trials don't go because with this

0:18:11.730,0:18:12.410
like I said

0:18:12.410,0:18:20.389
I've learned how to approach the problems better because because I'm delivered now does not mean they will not come again

0:18:20.820,0:18:27.620
So God has simply told me on time that I should expect more, but then this is how best to

0:18:28.290,0:18:31.579
Handle them. It's right thing got some wonderful

0:18:32.670,0:18:34.590
wisdom

0:18:34.590,0:18:37.130
You've shared with us as well. We just want to take you back

0:18:37.850,0:18:41.990
what was your experience when Prophet TB Joshua prayed for you and

0:18:42.510,0:18:48.319
Had you ever received that kind of touch before in the past as soon as a prophet prayed for me

0:18:49.380,0:18:51.380
There was something different

0:18:51.480,0:18:56.209
In fact the first experience was that I had a very wonderful sleep

0:18:56.910,0:19:03.949
You know I had I felt coming my spirit. I felt some peace my spirit first. That was the first

0:19:04.890,0:19:06.690
experience that night

0:19:06.690,0:19:10.040
And then I woke up the next morning you know

0:19:10.860,0:19:14.060
Like me before. That's too diverse I

0:19:15.210,0:19:21.319
Wake up in the morning as soon as I turn to see them just beside this my oh hell. No what is this again?

0:19:21.780,0:19:26.389

0:19:45.800,0:19:48.849
I was just sentence to myself I

0:19:49.640,0:19:51.640
Like me the past

0:19:52.280,0:19:56.229
I'm possibly move out of slap him like his we copies

0:19:57.170,0:20:03.399

0:20:10.880,0:20:17.349
I was a very much like oh you really come mine. You know recent you could keep up with all of this

0:20:17.350,0:20:19.839
You know I start pre shooting from dominance

0:20:20.540,0:20:25.839
That actually he's my husband, and I meant to love him and appreciating for whatever

0:20:25.840,0:20:32.410
It's doing for me, so I felt that difference immediately. I can't see as instant as possible that night

0:20:33.140,0:20:35.170
No, we thank God Almighty for this

0:20:36.200,0:20:42.250
Incredible deliverance and the changes that have taken place in your life. You can really see that it was that evil spirit

0:20:42.350,0:20:44.350
that was behind the

0:20:44.840,0:20:50.199
The destruction of that marriage and so what want to do now, I want to hear from mr.

0:20:50.200,0:20:53.200

0:20:53.840,0:21:00.699
Thank you very much. My name is Pete. I pursue and I'm from Denver states. I'm a happy man today

0:21:01.550,0:21:03.759
because I've been through a lot I

0:21:05.330,0:21:07.330
Knew my wife

0:21:07.880,0:21:09.880
We stayed together

0:21:10.400,0:21:12.400
lived in one room

0:21:13.429,0:21:16.839
Slept on one bed for two years I

0:21:19.460,0:21:21.460
Had to change my

0:21:22.190,0:21:26.860
Z to be I wanted our to served she agreed hard time

0:21:27.740,0:21:30.069
Played together had a lot of romance

0:21:30.770,0:21:36.709
One thing we never did was she told me young my aunt marry me as yeah, so she said

0:21:37.470,0:21:41.329
If truly I'm serious. I don't marry her I should become

0:21:42.450,0:21:45.200
the nursing my sometimes who fight

0:21:46.290,0:21:48.290
Namah namah were best of friends

0:21:49.170,0:21:54.709
So when I decided to be serious with the relationship after two years. I met I'm a

0:21:55.590,0:21:57.120
2012

0:21:57.120,0:22:01.429
20 2012 or together 2013 by the end of it

0:22:02.250,0:22:06.739
2010 when I decided to marry that was the beginning of my troubles with my wife

0:22:08.040,0:22:15.769
When I'm not there I could talk was my low for a comparators kind of 1/5. Talk to her the card is finished

0:22:16.650,0:22:20.359
As soon as she set her eyes on me

0:22:20.790,0:22:24.829
They'll be trouble I was drinking that I was lying to my sinking

0:22:25.530,0:22:32.389
So one of those days a Saturday friend. Oh, we're discussing boy aunt Marion. This is the trouble and

0:22:34.620,0:22:36.000
For

0:22:36.000,0:22:42.979
About those years that I've lived on earth. I've never ever in my life. This is that a width:auto

0:22:44.010,0:22:46.010
Because I grow up from a Catholic home

0:22:47.460,0:22:49.460
Eventually when I got there I

0:22:49.860,0:22:57.349
Discovered that it was a spiritualist. I so I'm yeah. I can't go back. Let me get to know I sat down

0:22:58.020,0:23:04.429
And they told me the trope was not behind my marriage my wife was not meant to marry

0:23:05.460,0:23:10.970
Past relationship is what are you going after? I know that I know that so I should bring a folk reason

0:23:12.000,0:23:15.739
They'll do some concourse and give us who take and then every to be over

0:23:16.830,0:23:18.830
So I came back to LA she was

0:23:19.320,0:23:22.100
Discourses haha she said over her dead body

0:23:23.370,0:23:26.179
She will never visit any witch doctor for any reason

0:23:26.820,0:23:32.990
The herself I suspected that something is wrong with her. How kind of beautiful my

0:23:34.890,0:23:37.129
Youngest to get married to somebody who loves you

0:23:37.679,0:23:41.689
Here might show her love and nice type of marriage and phase one

0:23:41.690,0:23:46.610
All right sure sir found the place. We are suppose we for prayers

0:23:47.409,0:23:54.329
So she say instead of going to the house craft witch doctor we should visit her man of God or reach in there

0:23:54.880,0:23:56.999
now man of God said

0:23:58.480,0:24:00.009
They say

0:24:00.009,0:24:05.099
75 to 80% of the teens I was toward so I believed her I

0:24:05.860,0:24:07.860
Believe that so we're going dia

0:24:08.289,0:24:10.289
best changes were no economy

0:24:11.500,0:24:15.419
Changes were not coming my wife could look at me in the face

0:24:18.519,0:24:24.869
When I decided husband tomorrow she told me that I have no affection for you it was cool

0:24:26.590,0:24:34.500
But because I hadn't knowledge or what the problem was and this woman of God have told us what the problem was inevitable

0:24:35.620,0:24:37.620
Okay, just tell us

0:24:37.929,0:24:44.369
When you first met yeah for how long was the relationship going really well for two years for two years

0:24:44.409,0:24:47.189
And then at what point did you realize that?

0:24:47.889,0:24:53.128
this was a spiritual problem, and it was not normal at what point two years and then

0:24:53.919,0:25:00.599
What I decided to marry her when I proposed to her. I took out somewhere to propose to her but

0:25:01.899,0:25:07.799
She said God is difficult for her to get Israel she loves me, but she has no affection for me

0:25:09.429,0:25:15.239
She loves me she knew cause me goodness and me that she has no affection for me

0:25:16.600,0:25:23.339
And that I one of God told us a lot of things and that's one very fundamental in Douma said I can be moving

0:25:24.220,0:25:27.059
What's your complexion or fecha Lamar said?

0:25:27.820,0:25:29.820
family affection

0:25:31.090,0:25:33.090
Mera kaam

0:25:33.190,0:25:38.519
So if I live we live a prayer place and go, but we were running around

0:25:39.549,0:25:41.259
She will agree

0:25:41.259,0:25:43.259
Few days after she said no

0:25:43.720,0:25:51.449
So a few days after she said no and that the events now happening cross. I just knew that it was an omen

0:25:52.570,0:25:58.500
Of let me let me just quickly chip in there at the point where he says I agreed and a nice

0:25:58.640,0:26:00.620
No, you know what we got to this woman

0:26:00.620,0:26:07.310
She's a prophetess their fellowship with so when he said she gets to have her beliefs. I said we should go to the woman

0:26:08.010,0:26:10.010
Do something she said to me she said

0:26:10.920,0:26:15.739
If I don't get married to my husband then I'll never get married in my life

0:26:16.710,0:26:22.370
And so you know I had all of this going through my mind, so if I don't get married to this man

0:26:22.790,0:26:24.570
I'm not going to get married

0:26:24.570,0:26:31.579
Because when I went to high I was confused and I told her that please I want you know if this - my husband knows

0:26:31.830,0:26:33.830
Exactly what took me in there

0:26:34.080,0:26:36.650
So when when we finally got there?

0:26:36.650,0:26:38.240
She told me that any man

0:26:38.240,0:26:45.109
I'll bring to the church that is my husband and eventually I was taking my husband did not

0:26:45.870,0:26:51.770
- see he's my husband, but because of the problems we had and he discovered it at happiness

0:26:52.130,0:26:53.840
And then so I told him that ok

0:26:53.840,0:26:57.650
Let's seek the face of God which I had our talents in also getting there

0:26:57.650,0:27:02.359
And then she telling me that if I don't get married to this man. I was never going to get married

0:27:02.910,0:27:07.040
That's also compounded my problem. You know to think of idiots

0:27:07.590,0:27:10.490
my flesh is saying no to this my the same times the

0:27:10.740,0:27:14.180
Prophetess who sees better than I do is telling me that if I don't get married to this man

0:27:14.180,0:27:20.299
I will never get married so it compounded my problem and made me act the way I did off

0:27:20.340,0:27:23.000
You know I would say yesterday say no tomorrow

0:27:23.550,0:27:28.430
Like that so three days to our traditional marriage. I was in a house

0:27:30.210,0:27:36.290
About some time it was such me the father the modern high myself

0:27:37.890,0:27:40.640
We are ready how the next three days would be

0:27:42.750,0:27:45.109
She told her mother in my presence

0:27:45.600,0:27:51.410
now if the mother agrees the mother's got to marry me and she walked out on me the father and mother I

0:27:53.010,0:27:54.300
Really

0:27:54.300,0:27:58.909
Took my car what to town had seven bottles of beer that

0:27:59.550,0:28:03.680

Told she was no longer interested in married three days to the wedding. Yes, actually. What's your reaction then I wanted to make history

0:29:26.610,0:29:33.589

0:30:50.010,0:30:52.010
praying for us

0:30:52.440,0:30:54.440
But a lot of things happened

0:30:55.320,0:31:00.049
Within this time were dogs on work that were hard money somewhere

0:31:00.990,0:31:03.650
The work that she was doing an hour's dream

0:31:04.350,0:31:08.060
She had some good money somewhere and my owners refused opium

0:31:09.240,0:31:14.030
So we started looking for me at the border, and then you know God have a way of doing things

0:31:15.240,0:31:19.880
It will closed we're off a then go to Joe's open always small noise

0:31:20.010,0:31:26.060
Okay, so you finally got married after your marriage? What were the challenges and issues you are facing?

0:31:27.300,0:31:28.590
Yeah

0:31:28.590,0:31:32.270
If I began to say or just cause the challenges I faced

0:31:33.090,0:31:34.980
Yet

0:31:34.980,0:31:36.980
but the remarkables a

0:31:38.370,0:31:40.370
Married this beautiful me

0:31:42.060,0:31:49.399
For three to four months I have not met her husband our lives. What was leaving the room like toys

0:31:50.700,0:31:54.770
To appoint her to console me my office to talk to her

0:31:56.430,0:31:58.350
That's

0:31:58.350,0:32:01.219
There was no changes to a point

0:32:03.060,0:32:07.609
This is very intelligent that own or Dysport she started

0:32:08.310,0:32:10.429
Living a plastic life with me

0:32:11.580,0:32:14.030
She wanted it, but you know

0:32:14.760,0:32:16.760
What you're not being from your heart?

0:32:17.190,0:32:19.429
At a point where oh do it?

0:32:20.250,0:32:23.599
Angle cone angle setting and that will disappear

0:32:25.020,0:32:29.270
That led me into massive massive intake of alcohol

0:32:33.760,0:32:35.760
I've married I sat down

0:32:36.400,0:32:40.440
I've paid a bride price. I've told Gordon the church. You are my wife

0:32:41.530,0:32:43.530
Why can't I meet your old man? How I?

0:32:44.440,0:32:52.320
So I want it massive drinking my office walls are supposed to start by 8:00 8:30. I'll leave the house 7 o clock

0:32:53.770,0:32:58.259
The first place obviously to be by Apollo sometimes I end up not going to the office

0:33:00.070,0:33:06.449
How's tea I'll drink some days, I'll come back some days sometimes

0:33:06.940,0:33:10.739
I'll come back two days after three days after

0:33:12.130,0:33:14.130
same clothes

0:33:14.140,0:33:20.280
After can record this part of the town to Murom drive it rather a part of the town sim clue so dark

0:33:20.800,0:33:26.249
Those people saw me yesterday. Oh those clothes are not seen in design. They today. I'm another part

0:33:27.160,0:33:29.369
and then when I get home a

0:33:33.850,0:33:37.050
Cretan environment, yes, you could ask me am I coming from

0:33:38.080,0:33:43.770
Because I told her you're sending me away from the house, so you have no right to ask me. I'm coming for a

0:33:44.350,0:33:46.350
common path I

0:33:46.390,0:33:54.089
Develop a techniques of moving up a project with a body my car so that I won't have a problem of changing my clothes

0:33:55.780,0:33:57.520
How drink

0:33:57.520,0:34:04.259
Sometimes I will sit sleepy Apollo. I will not be drinking that our local. I had the capacity to

0:34:05.980,0:34:09.959
Drink from money tonight on a two-day break

0:34:11.380,0:34:14.519
And no joints that starts by 10:00 p.m.

0:34:15.220,0:34:20.880
So when I finish the joints are closes by 9:00 or 10:00. I moved to the one that starts by 10:00 p.m.

0:34:20.950,0:34:22.950
To 6:00 a.m.. I

0:34:24.399,0:34:26.489
Invested my money into alcohol and

0:34:27.580,0:34:33.029
The devil ever worked many things it's the person who said the devil who of the things

0:34:33.850,0:34:36.179
He will lead you to those friends that

0:34:36.790,0:34:43.199
Will add to your predicaments that you take your foolish with that you'll do yourself good

0:34:45.580,0:34:47.939
Because it harder, we'll celebrate

0:34:48.520,0:34:55.919
However, they knew that if they call me. They will give me one, but two bottles and our deaf I cut off

0:34:56.770,0:35:00.179
Because they knew that I am never tired and I said I want to go home

0:35:01.690,0:35:06.659
So those are the kind of friends that the devil brought into my life at a time I

0:35:08.140,0:35:14.580
Was into drinking even after my investing in 2006 and so I was still very slim like you are

0:35:16.090,0:35:18.090
When I got married I

0:35:18.550,0:35:20.850
didn't even give out opportunity of

0:35:21.610,0:35:23.610
Telling me there's no joy

0:35:24.550,0:35:27.689
So and that's why you find out a lot of young people

0:35:28.780,0:35:33.719
Today you see their Envy Apollo's find out a body a home something is wrong

0:35:34.360,0:35:41.309
gossiping to me has happened to me and so that's actually give us trouble I

0:35:42.790,0:35:47.969
Knew that's it does that the test of alcohol that was my best friend I

0:35:48.609,0:35:53.819
Can't pick my best friend when I called her to ask me

0:35:56.170,0:36:02.010
It were to a point if I get home axilla, what are you even doing in this house?

0:36:04.900,0:36:10.080
What are you doing in this house pack your things I'll leave by Quixote's I give me space

0:36:13.680,0:36:15.800

Was said I bless go together. I please go today so wonderful a

0:36:24.150,0:36:27.229
Woman was married in mind you have no affection always for

0:36:27.810,0:36:32.239
Then you're leaving the room with a person for three years. It's not three days. We're talking about

0:36:34.020,0:36:36.020
Who did this three years

0:36:36.060,0:36:37.740
ago comes

0:36:37.740,0:36:40.640
As well sit in yanaka tell her how many times of smite?

0:36:41.310,0:36:43.400
To smile with each other I can tell you

0:36:44.700,0:36:46.700
three years

0:36:46.860,0:36:48.380
Okay, mr. Pizza

0:36:48.380,0:36:50.749
Can I just actually a quick one it's about all the?

0:36:50.970,0:36:54.560
Difficulties you were passing through you are facing what called veins

0:36:54.560,0:37:01.580
Do you not give up on the marriage because evening those in who is Kraft told me that if my wife is fully delivered

0:37:01.580,0:37:03.580
I'm going to enjoy my own

0:37:04.740,0:37:06.770
But the devil actually

0:37:07.320,0:37:13.789
Blindfolded me not to seek God in the right way not to seek to redeem my marriage in the right way

0:37:13.790,0:37:18.499
I will visit one little doctor to the order to attend maternity

0:37:19.500,0:37:26.179
Obviously the man of God who can give professes that any dissenting, but the problem was still there, so

0:37:29.760,0:37:33.229
The perfect we work and moving is God

0:37:34.140,0:37:38.599
God wanted to do annuity in our lives God wanted to use meaning

0:37:39.960,0:37:44.660
As yoga pose to teach the world like what gender now?

0:37:46.050,0:37:49.459
To let them know that it is better and best in Christ

0:37:50.280,0:37:51.600
but

0:37:51.600,0:37:53.900
Which were a lot to a point I?

0:37:54.540,0:37:58.939
Look at again. I also have a word less privilege

0:37:59.910,0:38:02.119
Not less privilege because were from a poor

0:38:03.090,0:38:04.290
but

0:38:04.290,0:38:09.229
You not be able to stand out of my OMA, and I'll get to see I know I appreciate me

0:38:10.320,0:38:15.259
I'll look at the one that is more than her a good clue so her to appreciate me

0:38:15.600,0:38:18.589
And then I knew that something was actually wrong in my own

0:38:20.070,0:38:25.279
Today and celebrity her as a mother of my children a raccoon

0:38:26.950,0:38:28.950
This hat has

0:38:29.440,0:38:36.089
My daughter is going to have part of it because it is not easy for a woman was not affection for you

0:38:36.940,0:38:38.940
2004 three years

0:38:39.310,0:38:40.900
three years

0:38:40.900,0:38:46.469
Whatever, I will tell you that go home manage. Ah at the end of the days of the tour for now I

0:38:47.410,0:38:50.099
Didn't come but in these three years so not to divert attention

0:38:50.800,0:38:53.070
For me, okay, can you tell us?

0:38:55.330,0:38:59.729
Mentioned earlier that you separated for five months, what led you to

0:39:00.580,0:39:03.930
Finally seeking the face of God at the synagogue Church of All Nations

0:39:05.050,0:39:08.459
Between you and your wife our God is a merciful God

0:39:09.490,0:39:11.490
their message of God

0:39:12.100,0:39:18.630
Would leave in Makati yeah, hi long way down, and I would leave the house for three days

0:39:18.630,0:39:20.819
Oh, no come back. She was there docile

0:39:21.730,0:39:23.730
so when she left I

0:39:23.890,0:39:31.709
Decided to stay indoors, and I regretted every minute of what I did was he down on me

0:39:33.370,0:39:36.959
This more gear inside this house all alone

0:39:39.160,0:39:43.410
I'll come back or not I get she will humbly come

0:39:45.310,0:39:50.670
And I was caught harder at the turn of the road she saw wasn't no the son of my car

0:39:51.580,0:39:57.539
But in this time I sent a text messages that we're covering rates. She didn't respond and of them

0:39:58.360,0:40:02.729
What did you speak to each other for 37 days? I was counting I

0:40:03.850,0:40:11.459
Know the circumstances that led to certain things actually told Nina something was wrong on my wedding day hard accident

0:40:11.530,0:40:13.420
On my wedding day

0:40:13.420,0:40:17.670
Nobody was driving the car. I parked the car was talking to somebody at it cost at a movie

0:40:17.670,0:40:21.269
I dusted it was he parked. I told my house

0:40:22.240,0:40:26.219
And I wanted to find out where she was yeah housing book. I heard resident

0:40:27.310,0:40:30.269
So a lot of things happened that I fed one on nama

0:40:30.940,0:40:33.750
as I said let us seek the face of God I

0:40:35.230,0:40:38.669
Appreciated pathos that prayed for us. They did a wonderful job

0:40:39.760,0:40:45.179
But I think God was preparing us to give us a testimony. We are we are today?

0:40:46.000,0:40:48.959
And so I have even received hours

0:40:48.960,0:40:55.139
I have seen snow prophet to be just a humble man. They coincide Holmes

0:40:56.950,0:40:59.069
Wonder forms now Sam

0:40:59.069,0:41:03.269
I was a pretty wife on that test when I watch I think for 30 years 35 years

0:41:03.369,0:41:05.729
Because idea God was able to look at that

0:41:06.789,0:41:10.229
So it was when she left the audience that I committed me

0:41:11.109,0:41:13.000
Ecstatic on me to me

0:41:13.000,0:41:20.639
And so she has watching. Anywhere is God. She will go a new you the name of God is national shoulder

0:41:22.089,0:41:26.339
So wait this cousin, and she told me that she's tired of go to prayer houses

0:41:29.440,0:41:35.190
The only place she go now if it is synagogue she's ready

0:41:37.059,0:41:40.109
That was where our finances

0:41:42.190,0:41:46.559
Brenda did ever knew that food gets here will be set free

0:41:48.520,0:41:53.639
Every other person I discusses I why do you need to go to synagogue, not I have synagogue in Makati

0:41:54.640,0:41:59.700
Those pastors and pray for us that my wife. Don't want to be unreasonable. I never give up

0:42:01.450,0:42:04.260
So I did all I could I

0:42:05.920,0:42:08.789
Left pleasure to seek God and

0:42:09.460,0:42:11.639
eventually who Katya I

0:42:12.700,0:42:15.119
Will cut his sentence significant happen

0:42:15.910,0:42:19.139

0:42:36.049,0:42:39.369
When I came I came with it, what would this thorn in my heart

0:42:40.309,0:42:47.288
If you look at me, you will know that house more happy to a point. I I was a civil a man time I

0:42:47.930,0:42:49.960
could be a bedroom slippers and

0:42:51.680,0:42:54.609
Go outside your house something I never did before

0:42:55.789,0:43:00.518
If you're always not settled a gone you're gone. You can never find peace

0:43:03.589,0:43:09.999
How did you feel when you saw that your wife was receiving deliver oh my goodness

troubles room and

0:43:25.940,0:43:27.079

0:43:27.079,0:43:32.229
The man of course you know I was lucky that I got it was when a man of God before her

0:43:33.049,0:43:37.629
So when I got a touch I felt relief instantly it's not magic

0:43:38.539,0:43:40.539
It's not magic

0:43:40.940,0:43:45.159
It's not magic. I feel relief so I was walking happily out

0:43:46.130,0:43:50.769
And then I had a sound and when I talked to the television dollar close to me

0:43:50.769,0:43:53.529
I saw my wife manifest and say thank you Jesus

0:43:55.309,0:44:00.069
Immediately I saw that I said, thank you Jesus. I knew that the end has come

0:44:01.849,0:44:03.849
The end of our troubles are

0:49:04.430,0:49:07.690
You know I and I understand why people

Wanna go I'm not saying that those who pray for us before they didn't it didn't do work

0:49:13.850,0:49:18.189
You did your part well God want us to want that also get out deliverance

0:49:19.970,0:49:25.300
We thank God Almighty for this radical transformation that has come in your marriage

0:49:25.300,0:49:31.090
And we know our viewers are watching and we know they have been blessed by all

0:49:31.430,0:49:36.880
They are shared with them, and they also have questions. They want to ask you which I?

0:49:38.810,0:49:45.489
Like to ask you and then maybe we would answer them and share more lighter than what you're saying okay?

0:49:46.310,0:49:50.289
so we have a question from one of our viewers and

0:49:51.080,0:49:52.580
It says

0:49:52.580,0:49:59.319
My name is Calista from New Zealand and the question goes to you mr.. Peter it says

0:49:59.990,0:50:03.790
When crisis hits your marriage you run - how cool

0:50:04.220,0:50:10.750
So like many do so what did you learn from that and what advice can you give to others about that?

0:50:12.020,0:50:15.459
Yeah, some days. That's a

0:50:16.820,0:50:18.820
Crisis hits you

0:50:19.940,0:50:26.710
Okay, well you're not Rocco or you know these abilities you rather destroy yourself on your soul I?

0:50:27.350,0:50:29.350
Wouldn't read I destroyed myself

0:50:29.930,0:50:36.790
But finishes my peace at home and all that so, but we're on to Christ today

0:50:36.790,0:50:40.239
I'm celebrating because I'm fully God Christ

0:50:41.090,0:50:43.090
so nobody

0:50:43.340,0:50:48.399
Don't body should receive you that when you have crisis rock or you can forget it

0:50:49.340,0:50:55.749
For one minute you forget it the next minute. It will come more. It's rather increase your crisis

0:50:57.440,0:51:00.310
Today I have not our life, but our crisis crisis

0:51:01.310,0:51:03.999
Life with Christ you have absolute peace

0:51:04.790,0:51:06.790
absolute necessity

0:51:07.920,0:51:10.010
Okay, so we have

0:51:11.430,0:51:16.490
Another question and it's for the both of you. It's from Steve from Canada and

0:51:17.400,0:51:18.990
he says

0:51:18.990,0:51:22.400
Me and my partner have been dating for more than a year now

0:51:22.790,0:51:27.110
And we are looking to tie the knot what advice do you have for us?

0:51:30.390,0:51:32.390
First DLC

0:51:33.300,0:51:37.999
Yet to tie the knots you should avail yourself for deliverance

0:51:39.060,0:51:41.060
But that's I mean

0:51:41.280,0:51:47.120
Probably you feel you're alright even physically. There's nothing wrong with you, and of course the bottle fee

0:51:47.120,0:51:52.249
I enjoy yourself, but I'm just telling you this even gue passes through fire

0:51:52.950,0:51:54.950
should be what it is and

0:51:55.140,0:52:00.109
So you shouldn't think all this rosin all is okay? He's just

0:52:00.810,0:52:08.689
By the side there isn't so I've been yourself the both of them for deliverance first before going into the marriage

0:52:11.040,0:52:17.330
Yeah, and for those who are married already all of us need deliverance

0:52:18.630,0:52:25.999
No force need deliverance you may be fully yourself thinking that mr.. A is the problem mr.. B is the problem

0:52:26.610,0:52:28.610
There's a spirit behind

0:52:29.040,0:52:31.040
every circumstances that happens

0:52:31.770,0:52:35.120
In our lives today. I can't testify to that

0:52:36.300,0:52:38.300
so to say your husband-to-be

0:52:38.790,0:52:44.090
Is a problem already it's a problem or your wife? I wrongly accused my wife

0:52:45.930,0:52:47.930
Even don't know fortunately they deliver us

0:52:48.540,0:52:51.229
But that should not happen physical, huh?

0:52:51.960,0:52:54.050
Should I read a sect God for deliverance?

0:52:54.630,0:53:00.199
Was it wasn't getting live at every other Court in comes your way today. I'm enjoying it I

0:53:01.140,0:53:03.319
Wish I had taken disturb years back

0:53:04.470,0:53:07.490
The cost time is said to be the best so this is his time

0:53:08.190,0:53:10.190
so I appreciate and

0:53:11.520,0:53:13.520
We are going for deliverance

0:53:14.820,0:53:17.989
Go to deliverance in a life spirit church

0:53:19.140,0:53:21.470
If your pot you come to synagogue

0:53:22.020,0:53:28.699
Nobody should deceive you no, but this man is a man of God. I'm a practical example to that I

Around the world as well. Thank you very much. Thank you for

0:54:53.349,0:55:00.058
Here about my reach. It's more like your physician test smoothes the better fools is

0:55:00.940,0:55:08.190
Fair you come in stories you hear about people getting married before honeymoon and all the dream for me to escape in

0:55:09.069,0:55:10.630
2010 when I decide that my

0:55:10.630,0:55:17.369
That was the beginning of my troubles of my wife we had fun times up to the moments when he said you intend to marry

0:55:17.369,0:55:20.488
me at that point in time when your wife to be the

0:55:20.739,0:55:24.869
Holding. She was no longer interested in marry you three days to the wedding. Yes actually

0:55:24.910,0:55:30.599
What's your reaction, then I wanted to make history just three days to my traditional marriage. I

0:55:31.809,0:55:37.319
Told him bluntly I'm not playing tomorrow. Let's see him, and he cheated me

0:55:37.989,0:55:43.739
He sighs structurally I hated him and like who unity spot very very good

0:55:44.069,0:55:50.459
What was your experience when Prophet TB Joshua prayed for you as soon as a prophet treat for me

0:55:50.460,0:55:55.710
It was something different right now me seemed like just when he steps out like a boy

0:55:55.710,0:56:00.359
Why do you have this problems of quarantine don't about the enormous?

0:56:01.029,0:56:06.959
Adhering you've always irritated all of us by God me and maybe the famous Sonoma

0:56:06.960,0:56:11.489
I'm here to tell them to be it sees motional at the Saltaire, Oksana

0:56:14.940,0:56:16.440
Well what a wonderful

0:56:16.440,0:56:18.800
testimony and the life of mr. And mrs

0:56:18.869,0:56:22.819
Apostle and we believe that there are many lessons that you learn from it

0:56:22.820,0:56:30.049
You know that unfavorable situations the great arguments that Satan uses to make children of God to question their sonship

0:56:30.330,0:56:36.619
Question their marriage and other areas of their life and even question if what they are doing is the will of God for their lives

0:56:36.619,0:56:39.829
The fact that you are a child of God does not eliminate

0:56:40.500,0:56:46.850
Adversity such as the circumstances that happened in their marriage, but rather being a child of God

0:56:47.369,0:56:49.549
Turns that adversity into an opportunity

0:56:50.070,0:56:54.799
For God to manifest his glory in that situation yes viewers

0:56:54.800,0:56:59.300
We believe you are seen in their experience that God can use any situation

0:56:59.300,0:57:07.159
I mean any foolish thing for his purpose and bring good out of evil what seem like evil in the face of the painful

0:57:07.410,0:57:09.680
experience of chronic disagreements

0:57:10.320,0:57:17.570
Disgust and hatred was eventually used by God to strengthen their determination and desire for him

0:57:18.119,0:57:26.059
yes, what Satan meant for bad God made it work for good and this testimony has taught us that we need to rest in a

0:57:26.060,0:57:33.259
place that God has for us, so that his grace can cover us, so if you find yourself in a situation that is contrary to

0:57:33.810,0:57:35.989
Expectations in Christ don't budge

0:57:36.390,0:57:44.150
don't pull out stay put and get used to that situation so that you can gain the necessary experience a maturity to handle the

0:57:44.640,0:57:47.180
responsibilities in Christ so viewers

0:57:47.700,0:57:51.379
Whatever situation you are facing in your marriage should not break it

0:57:51.630,0:57:59.540
But rather strengthen it and your marriage can only be strengthened by you've run into Jesus Christ for he is the great

0:57:59.910,0:58:06.619
