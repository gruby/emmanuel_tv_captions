0:00:03.780,0:00:09.860
Emmanuel! God is with us! My name is Salami D. And my name is Justin.

0:00:09.860,0:00:15.240
Viewers all over the world, we welcome you to today's episode of changing lives.

0:00:15.240,0:00:23.580
In this program, we are going to take you beyond the testimony, to the heart of how life was and how life is,

0:00:23.580,0:00:28.960
after an encounter with Jesus Christ through the Ministry of Prophet TB Joshua.

0:00:28.960,0:00:36.800
Yes, throughout human history we have seen that those who bless God in their trials will be blessed by God through their trials and

0:00:36.800,0:00:42.840
through this interview we will listen to people's real-life trials how they responded how they overcame through God

0:00:42.840,0:00:48.500
And why they are rejoicing in the Lord today, and why you too can. Yes and today,

0:00:48.500,0:00:53.140
we will have the pleasure of speaking with the Ipusu's.

0:00:53.140,0:01:00.400
Their experience of marriage had been a difficult one that would rub the faith of almost everyone.

0:01:00.400,0:01:06.600
Today, God's grace has united them with the unshakable peace and love.

0:01:06.600,0:01:12.560
Their incredible journey, along the highway of marriage, seemed to end even before it had begun.

0:01:12.560,0:01:16.820
Not knowing that the challenges and the trials they were going through in their

0:01:16.820,0:01:21.480
relationship were only the tip of the iceberg. Their story is an eye

0:01:21.480,0:01:26.760
opener to the real cause of why many marriages don't work out today;

0:01:26.760,0:01:34.880
ultimately leading to divorce and how the bitter taste of life's trouble can be replaced with the sweetness of God's grace.

0:01:34.880,0:01:39.840
So be blessed as you join us in Jesus name. So, here, with us on Changing Lives,

0:01:39.840,0:01:42.680
we have our special guests with us here, today:

0:01:42.680,0:01:48.360
Mr. And Mrs. Ipisu's. You're very welcome. How are you today?

0:01:48.360,0:01:56.220
Fantastic so we'll start off with Dosu Ipisu. Can you introduce yourself to us and share with us your wonderful  testimony.

0:01:56.220,0:02:02.140
Thank you very much. My name is Dosu Ipisu.

0:02:02.140,0:02:10.100
My testimony is about, how I had lost affection for my husband and my experiences before and after my marriage.

0:02:10.100,0:02:15.080
And then tracing back, before I got marriage: what you hear about marriage is

0:02:15.080,0:02:20.640
more like something smooth, the bed of roses,

0:02:20.640,0:02:24.960
fun fair, you know. How many stories you hear about people getting married,

0:02:24.960,0:02:29.320
how they go for honeymoon and that was a dream for me as a young lady.

0:02:29.320,0:02:35.020
And then I met my husband, Mr Peter. He came along. We dated.

0:02:35.020,0:02:39.720
We had fun times up to the moment he said he wanted to marry me.

0:02:39.720,0:02:42.560
That was pic of hell in my life because

0:02:42.560,0:02:47.980
at that moment, he irritated me so much. I hated him more.

0:02:47.980,0:02:54.560
You know, he disgusted me. That's all I understood. At some point, I told him that why it must only be me.

0:02:54.560,0:03:00.140
What is so special about me. And I had a lot of psychological problems.

0:03:00.140,0:03:03.420
Thinking "why is this happening to me and all of that?''

0:03:03.420,0:03:09.420
And then I related to my parents and they told me that I should keep up with it. He's a good man.

0:03:09.420,0:03:16.800
Why not go a head and  I told them :  I don't have affection so how do I live with somebody that I don't love?

0:03:16.800,0:03:22.200
They keep telling me that love grows by the day. I told them let me back off from there now.

0:03:22.200,0:03:25.620
And hope that it comes on better.

0:03:25.620,0:03:28.480
But ,you know, it got more difficult.

0:03:28.480,0:03:33.680
Then just three days to my traditional marriage ,

0:03:33.680,0:03:36.240
I told him bluntly I'm not

0:03:36.240,0:03:41.400
going to marry him. Then my mom heard this she was like:'' oh my daughter, please,

0:03:41.400,0:03:44.880
you know, this is a dream for every mother to see her child get married.

0:03:44.880,0:03:50.300
And in my own case, I told her:'' for any reason whatsoever if you give him your consent;

0:03:50.300,0:03:52.720
then you're going in for the marriage".

0:03:52.720,0:03:57.540
So I related to him: you young man, I am not getting married to you.

0:03:57.540,0:04:03.700
I told him that bluntly and that's not easy  to digest, you know! Three days to your marriage. It goes well.

0:04:03.700,0:04:10.500
He's going for the traditional marriage so, whether or not I come there it should be it fine,

0:04:10.500,0:04:13.560
get married if not he will walk away.

0:04:13.560,0:04:17.440
And so I fought that through until the day of our traditional marriage.

0:04:17.440,0:04:23.240
I finally got married against my will, anyway, I just did that out of play, jokes...

0:04:23.240,0:04:26.820
to just please my parents and

0:04:26.820,0:04:28.520
let peace be.

0:04:28.520,0:04:31.600
And so I felt okay, after the marriage

0:04:31.600,0:04:37.820
I will experience some peace, maybe, just like my father promised that love will come and will grow by the day.

0:04:37.820,0:04:44.580
We will get to do things that would get me into... but that never happened.

0:04:44.580,0:04:49.080
It will shock you to know that it got worse my dear.

0:04:49.080,0:04:52.120
Just seeing him, it would irritate me.

0:04:52.120,0:04:58.540
His sight's structure, I hated it.  You with this pot-bellied where are you going too.

0:04:58.540,0:05:02.900
With stuff like that, and then he added it up with drinking.

0:05:02.900,0:05:08.000
He made it worse because I couldn't stand the odour.

0:05:08.000,0:05:15.940
He always stinks when he comes around. And in that kind of mood, he wants to crab jokes with me.

0:05:15.940,0:05:21.640
I never found anything funny. Even though he did his best. He would buy gifts when coming back home.

0:05:21.640,0:05:27.820
I didn't give into that kind, whether he gave me diamond, it didn't count. You know, I just wanted him to stay away.

0:05:27.820,0:05:33.860
Like this is a new marriage, you would like your husband around. He's not around you will miss him, you're

0:05:33.860,0:05:38.820
calling him. " Where are you? I didn't . In fact, it was fun for me when he was out. I had a great time  when he

0:05:38.820,0:05:42.000
wasn't at home. So that went on

0:05:42.000,0:05:46.200
until, we start moving around, looking for solutions.

0:05:46.200,0:05:51.500
We felt everything wasn't just normal. We went to prayer houses,

0:05:51.500,0:05:55.620
we went,  at his own side, he went to herbalists houses.

0:05:55.620,0:05:59.120
And then he came back telling me. Oh you are possessed.

0:05:59.120,0:06:06.220
They told me that" you're possessed with a spirit husband, and it's because you are possessed".

0:06:06.220,0:06:12.860
that's why, even at my workplace things are not moving or well for me. It's because you are possessed

0:06:12.860,0:06:17.100
that is why my car broke down, my business is not moving well.

0:06:17.100,0:06:20.540
And for your information, you will not have children.

0:06:20.540,0:06:27.540
More, so, reality will soon dawn on you.  I'm quoting him now. "You know, he told me reality will soon dawn on you".

0:06:27.540,0:06:33.420
And then I taught myself, what  am I doing in this place? Of what use am I in this place?

0:06:33.420,0:06:38.700
I am a woman who is not going to have kids. Your certificate  will not get you anything.

0:06:38.700,0:06:45.180
I mean, I'm causing more trouble than good in this place, so I better excuse myself.

0:06:45.180,0:06:49.420
Being who he is, I knew that I couldn't live that marriage,

0:06:49.420,0:06:53.860
when he was around.  I mean any time he was at home with me.

0:06:53.860,0:06:58.940
I could not live and so I took my time.

0:06:58.940,0:07:02.640
I was monitoring properly, and I knew exactly

0:07:02.640,0:07:05.580
when I was going to hit this.

0:07:05.580,0:07:10.300
You know. I just knew exactly when he was going to go out. How many hours he would have to spent?

0:07:10.300,0:07:19.360
wherever he went and it was on a Sunday. I had arranged with people out there, to come and pack my things.

0:07:19.360,0:07:25.860
When he went out I brought a vehicle. I packed each and everything. I mean

0:07:25.860,0:07:32.240
to the very last pin, I brought in to do my part, and that was my attention never to return.

0:07:32.240,0:07:35.740
What the am I coming back to do in this house?

0:07:35.740,0:07:40.520
When I'm not bringing any joy, I was not a fulfilled woman, not a satisfied woman.

0:07:40.520,0:07:43.840
So what was the reason for staying in the house?

0:07:43.840,0:07:50.940
So I packed with the intention of never  coming back to the house.

0:07:50.940,0:07:57.560
I didn't give any room whatsoever for conversation. I mean that no chance for him to call me.

0:07:57.560,0:08:03.740
Just not occur to me cope I didn't give in at me if you called me if I when I left the house of

0:08:03.740,0:08:08.660
Up to two months, I didn't pick his calls.

0:08:08.660,0:08:10.840
You know, I have that capacity.

0:08:10.840,0:08:18.360
Just when I want to do it, I do it properly. He  would call me,  I saw those calls. Some times, I blocked him

0:08:18.360,0:08:24.640
from calling me, some times, I was just doing some favour by letting the phone ringing while I would pick.

0:08:24.640,0:08:28.760
He would send text messages. They are there in my phone. I never replied to one.

0:08:28.760,0:08:37.020
There wasn't any form of communication. That is because I didn't want any resolution.

0:08:37.020,0:08:46.360
And then my parents want to ship in. I told them enough is enough. I heard this before getting into the marriage,

0:08:46.360,0:08:54.800
and it cost me this pain. What do you think? Whatever advise you will give me what good will it do to me?

0:08:54.800,0:09:07.580
And so it looked like, I was getting to stubborn. No one could approach me. But I felt that, I should take my time

0:09:07.580,0:09:14.380
to seek for God's face. Then I would know the will of God for my own marriage.

0:09:14.380,0:09:21.920
I've gone to many churches of course. It's not like they didn't pray for me, of course they did the best they could.

0:09:21.920,0:09:25.860
But then I didn't get the expected results.

0:09:25.860,0:09:30.240
I didn't get the good  goals, I yearned for.

0:09:30.240,0:09:39.000
I said; I will give one last try and that place is the Synagogue Church of All Nations.

0:09:39.000,0:09:45.360
Not because I was coming to look or to seek for prophet TB Joshua, is a mortal man like myself.

0:09:45.360,0:09:52.040
But I was coming to seek for that God in him, that sees in him mightily.

0:09:52.040,0:10:00.000
I said this to my husband. When finally I picked up my call. I told him for any reason whatsoever,

0:10:00.000,0:10:05.220
If we have to come back  together again, then we have one last mission together,

0:10:05.220,0:10:12.920
which is to travel down to Synagogue Church of All Nations and by any chance we get there and I don't  get

0:10:12.920,0:10:20.920
and I don't get delivered to the point where I will not experience changes myself, what will make my marriage

0:10:20.920,0:10:33.040
better. Then we should count ourselves divorced. I said if I am opportune to meet the man of God I would like

0:10:33.040,0:10:41.180
to find out from him: what is the will of God about this marriage? Because I remember, he said  always

0:10:41.180,0:10:47.400
that in whatever situation, you are going through: God is still saying something and as a good

0:10:47.400,0:10:53.400
a Christian, we should always seek to know what is God's opinion about that situation. That was the only

0:10:53.400,0:10:58.960
reason why we had to come together, and travel together, and talk together.

0:10:58.960,0:11:07.880
We were doing all of that just for us to come to Synagogue. It wasn't because I love you. No, it wasn't

0:11:07.880,0:11:21.780
none of that. I knew what I wanted.  All of that: hey , my love. There was just plastic makeup for us to come to SCOAN.

0:11:21.780,0:11:28.700
To God be the Glory.I think, I will simply say God's time is the best.

0:11:28.700,0:11:35.960
The choir, in Synagogue, sings: God's time is the best time, our time doesn't matter. I will simply say:

0:11:35.960,0:11:44.340
God met me this time that I came. Finally I was privileged to be prayed for by the man of God.

0:11:44.340,0:11:54.180
So, after you were married, it got to a point that you decided to separate. For how long were you separated,

0:11:54.180,0:11:59.960
before you decided that synagogue was the last bus stop. And you will seek the face of God at the

0:11:59.960,0:12:02.860
Synagogue Church of All Nations for pray.

0:12:02.860,0:12:15.340
In December, it will do three years in the marriage, and I left my husband on April 16. We came here.

0:12:15.340,0:12:19.660
It is about five months, I separated from the marriage.

0:12:19.660,0:12:27.140
and then when I came here, I was privileged to be touched by the man of God like I said and that touch!

0:12:27.140,0:12:34.260
Since that day! Actually, what I remembered, I manifested. I knew that something was speaking

0:12:34.260,0:12:43.560
through me. But I couldn't control it. I  really didn't want to act out that way, but I couldn't control. It manifested.

0:12:43.560,0:12:52.300
Eventually, I got delivered, and we went back. My husband, too, was prayed for and after then , it was not

0:12:52.300,0:12:53.480
like before.

0:12:53.480,0:12:57.200
I didn't want him around completely.

0:12:57.200,0:13:03.680
I, now, miss him. When he just steps out like that, I will call him: hey boy, where are you? I will ask him to come.

0:13:03.680,0:13:08.420
back. What's he doing? I want to be involved in every step of the way. You know every step of the way .

0:13:08.420,0:13:14.880
Now, I care. Now, I have something to discuss with him. It wasn't like that before.

0:13:14.880,0:13:20.840
If he brought up a joke. I will tell him don't you have something better to say?

0:13:20.840,0:13:24.060
You know, I would be like

0:13:24.060,0:13:26.320
What's that?

0:13:26.320,0:13:35.760
How do I relate to these things you were saying? I never enjoyed his conversations and his jokes, his gifts.

0:13:35.760,0:13:43.360
How he wanted to buy me so many gifts. They were so much but , I never valued them.

0:13:43.360,0:13:48.880
But after the prayer, I needed to think at  those things. I appreciated his efforts.

0:13:48.880,0:13:53.180
I acknowledged that he loved me. I felt that somebody cared for me.

0:13:53.180,0:13:58.700
I felt loved. I felt some satisfaction in me,  even though,

0:13:58.700,0:14:03.620
there are still some hitches there of course. It's not a bed of roses.

0:14:03.620,0:14:09.060
It's life generally and that goes for everybody, every relationship. It's not always smooth.

0:14:09.060,0:14:15.300
You, always, have those patches along the way, but then ,you know after that prayer,

0:14:15.300,0:14:21.940
I saw those problems in a different light and then my approach to them was also different.

0:14:21.940,0:14:25.280
Not like before. It brought us

0:14:25.280,0:14:30.620
troubles, gave me headaches, caused me to worry:" what am I doing in this?".

0:14:30.620,0:14:36.820
I, now, realize that it's not him who is a problem. I'm sure this is happening in order homes, too.

0:14:36.820,0:14:43.080
You have those problems of quarreling, you don't ever agree . You are always arguing.

0:14:43.080,0:14:49.840
You always irritated. You don't love your husband. You don't admire him and maybe the feeling is normal. I am

0:14:49.840,0:14:53.970
here to tell them that it is not normal. There is nothing normal about it.

0:14:53.970,0:15:00.720
There's something wrong somewhere and your husband or your wife is not the problem, look deeper.

0:15:00.720,0:15:02.700
You would find

0:15:02.700,0:15:10.860
who is engineering all of this and fight that element, else, you'll be fighting the wrong battle and

0:15:10.860,0:15:12.480
you will never

0:15:12.490,0:15:17.400
be victorious until the end. It is almost happened to me.

0:15:17.400,0:15:20.860
It almost wrecked my marriage.

0:15:20.860,0:15:26.840
But now, I know how to approach it better in the light of God:

0:15:26.840,0:15:34.000
to see that it is the enemy who is putting up these acts in him.

0:15:34.000,0:15:38.760
He has just simply came to steal my joy and

0:15:38.760,0:15:45.860
make make me feel like he's not worth it? What  am I doing with him? It's not him, it is the enemy who

0:15:45.860,0:15:50.640
does not want my happiness, who does not want us to enjoy our marriage, who does not want us to

0:15:50.640,0:15:58.800
live a Christ worthy life, because he knows that when he disturbs you and when your mind is not at rest,

0:15:58.800,0:15:59.710
when you are no more

0:15:59.710,0:16:04.100
happy within you because your heart is your prayer room,

0:16:04.100,0:16:09.540
as soon as he disturbs your heart, he gets your thinking, he gets your

0:16:09.540,0:16:13.900
You are ,now, doing some weird things that you know you supposed not be doing,

0:16:13.900,0:16:17.380
He knows that as soon as he does that

0:16:17.380,0:16:19.200
He has distorted your prayer life.

0:16:19.200,0:16:27.080
And so you can be able to fight back, rather you will see the man or the woman as the problem.

0:16:27.080,0:16:29.560
Now after that touch, I am

0:16:29.560,0:16:31.300
delivered and I have been taught how

0:16:31.300,0:16:37.360
to handle my problems in the light of God. Okay, so

0:16:37.360,0:16:39.980
looking back now, can you now say:

0:16:39.980,0:16:44.640
Maybe you've now regretted of doing things, your own way then?

0:16:44.640,0:16:47.160
Remember you did so many things. Sure, of course, I did.

0:16:47.160,0:16:49.400
You thought that you'll be home,yeah

0:16:49.400,0:16:53.820
But later on, you, now, thought  you need to seek the face of God.

0:16:53.820,0:16:56.820
Looking back now.

0:16:56.820,0:17:03.210
I wouldn't say, I regret exactly, not because I'm a Christian, I would not have challenges

0:17:03.210,0:17:06.280
Or I will not have temptation, in fact

0:17:06.280,0:17:10.880
when those temptations come rather than to strengthening me

0:17:10.880,0:17:14.760
because Man of God says our faith

0:17:14.760,0:17:17.400
is tested upon the soil of

0:17:17.400,0:17:26.560
troubles trials and are flourished upon that soil and so far. A Christian that I thought I used to be,

0:17:26.560,0:17:29.200
God won't count that as a mistake

0:17:29.200,0:17:35.400
because I've come back to him to seek His face. If I had remain in

0:17:35.400,0:17:38.420
diverse or separation  like I did

0:17:38.420,0:17:40.280
then I'll be condemned.

0:17:40.280,0:17:45.500
But I thank God for the Holy Spirit that also reminded me that it was not my place.

0:17:45.500,0:17:49.360
The devil is always trying to shift me away from my son-ship.

0:17:49.360,0:17:56.760
He's trying to shift me from my seat in God's presence, and so I will simply bless God for bringing me back

0:17:56.760,0:18:00.040
home. I call it back home because I

0:18:00.040,0:18:04.900
wonder what would have happened if I didn't come back and then again

0:18:04.900,0:18:11.640
I wonder how I would have grown if these trials did come because with this

0:18:11.640,0:18:12.400
like I said:

0:18:12.400,0:18:19.760
I've learned how to approach the problems better. Because I'm delivered now doesn't mean they will not

0:18:19.760,0:18:28.380
come again. God has simply told me on time that I should expect more, but then this is how best to

0:18:28.380,0:18:32.660
handle them. So that is wonderful

0:18:32.660,0:18:34.580
wisdom,

0:18:34.580,0:18:37.900
you've shared with us as well. We just want to take you back

0:18:37.900,0:18:42.540
what was your experience when Prophet TB. Joshua prayed for you and

0:18:42.540,0:18:49.400
had you ever received that kind of touch before in the past? As soon as prophet prayed for me

0:18:49.400,0:18:51.520
there was something different.

0:18:51.520,0:18:58.620
In fact, the first experience was that I had a very wonderful sleep.

0:18:58.620,0:19:04.920
I felt calm in my spirit. I felt some peace my spirit first. That was the first

0:19:04.920,0:19:06.680
experience that night.

0:19:06.680,0:19:10.880
And then I woke up the next morning, you know,

0:19:10.880,0:19:15.200
I mean before that deliverance.

0:19:15.200,0:19:21.680
I wake up in the morning, as soon as, I turn to see that I am still beside this man again. Oh, my God, what is this.

0:19:21.680,0:19:27.240
It's not happening again. I just hate his sight, just sighting alone.

0:19:27.240,0:19:30.780
It is just spoiled my day.

0:19:30.780,0:19:37.060
While I woke up before him that day. He was still sleeping and I sat back and I was looking at him.

0:19:37.060,0:19:45.860
How is it? Is this really me? It's you lying here. You didn't give up? Look at this man. There's more than this.

0:19:45.860,0:19:49.680
I was just sentenced to myself.

0:19:49.680,0:19:52.260
All I meant in the past,

0:19:52.260,0:19:57.180
I would possibly just slap him like this: hey wake  up is

0:19:57.180,0:20:03.940
day break already,  just take a bath and have your day at peace. series, so that I would have the house to myself.

0:20:03.940,0:20:05.480
Let me just have my space.

0:20:05.480,0:20:10.900
But that day when I woke up it was not like that. You know. I didn't want to disturb his sleep.

0:20:10.900,0:20:17.480
I was admiring him. Like: how are you? You are really a calmed man. You know, you could keep up with all

0:20:17.480,0:20:20.620
of this! I started appreciating from that moment.

0:20:20.620,0:20:25.840
That actually he's my husband, and I meant to love him and appreciate for whatever

0:20:25.840,0:20:33.160
is doing for me. so I felt that difference immediately. I can say that instant as possible that night

0:20:33.160,0:20:36.280
Now, we thank God Almighty for this

0:20:36.280,0:20:42.360
incredible deliverance and the changes that have taken place in your life. You can really see that it was that evil spirit

0:20:42.360,0:20:44.900
that was behind the

0:20:44.900,0:20:50.200
destruction of that marriage and so what I want to do now, I want to hear from Mr.

0:20:50.200,0:20:53.840
Peter now and hear your side of your testimony as well.

0:20:53.840,0:21:01.560
Thank you very much. My name is Peter  Ipusu and I'm from Ebenue states. I'm a happy man today

0:21:01.560,0:21:05.340
because I've been through a lot.

0:21:05.340,0:21:07.960
I Knew my wife.

0:21:07.960,0:21:10.480
We stayed together,

0:21:10.480,0:21:13.520
lived in one room,

0:21:13.520,0:21:19.500
slept on one bed for two years I

0:21:19.500,0:21:22.320
I had to change her A,

0:21:22.320,0:21:27.780
Y,Z to what I wanted to served her, she agreed. At time, we

0:21:27.780,0:21:30.780
played together, and had a lot of romance.

0:21:30.780,0:21:37.500
One thing, we never did was, she told me young man, you want to marry me? I said: yes. So, she said

0:21:37.500,0:21:42.480
If truly I'm serious, I want to marry her, I should be calm.

0:21:42.480,0:21:46.300
But sometimes we could fight.

0:21:46.300,0:21:49.200
Normally we  were best friends.

0:21:49.200,0:21:57.764
So when I decided to be serious with the relationship after two years. I met her in May 2012.

0:21:57.764,0:22:02.300
2012 we were together and 2013 by the end of it,

0:22:02.300,0:22:08.120
when I decided to marry her, that was the beginning of my troubles with my wife.

0:22:08.120,0:22:15.240
When I was not there, we could talk, we could smile on the phone. I could buy each other a card of 1,5 .

0:22:15.240,0:22:20.880
I would talk to her till the card are finished. As soon as she set her eyes on me,

0:22:20.880,0:22:25.760
there would be trouble. I was drinking but I was not in massive drinking.

0:22:25.760,0:22:35.040
So one of those days, I sat with a friend, we were discussing about marrying my wife but there is trouble.

0:22:35.040,0:22:44.060
For about those years that I've lived on earth, I've never ever in my life, visited a witch doctor.

0:22:44.060,0:22:47.480
Because I grow up from a Catholic home.

0:22:47.480,0:22:49.900
Eventually when I got there I

0:22:49.900,0:22:58.100
discovered that it was a spiritualist. I so I'm here. I can't go back. Let me get to know. I sat down

0:22:58.100,0:23:05.500
and they told me the troubles that were behind my marriage. That my wife was not meant to marry,

0:23:05.500,0:23:12.080
her past relationship is still going after her. And all sort of things. I should bring her for cleansing .

0:23:12.080,0:23:16.980
They would do some concoction and give her to take and then everything would be over.

0:23:16.980,0:23:19.400
So I came back to her

0:23:19.400,0:23:23.380
I discussed with her. She said over her dead body,

0:23:23.380,0:23:26.840
She will never visit any witch doctor for any reason.

0:23:26.840,0:23:34.960
But herself has suspected that something was wrong with her. How can a beautiful woman ,

0:23:34.960,0:23:37.720
every dream of a young girl is get married to somebody who loves her,

0:23:37.720,0:23:42.760
Here, I was showing her my love,  it was time for marriage and things were not going right.

0:23:42.760,0:23:47.480
She had found a place where she was  she was going for prayers.

0:23:47.480,0:23:54.980
So she said instead of going to the witch doctor we should visit the woman of God. We reached there

0:23:54.980,0:23:58.580
that woman of God said

0:23:58.580,0:24:00.000
let say

0:24:00.000,0:24:05.920
75 to 80% of the things I was told, so, I believed her.

0:24:05.920,0:24:08.320
I believed her so we're going there.

0:24:08.320,0:24:11.540
Best changes were not coming.

0:24:11.540,0:24:18.620
Changes were not coming. My wife could look at me in the face

0:24:18.620,0:24:26.640
When I decided I was going  to marry her, she told me that I have no affection for you, you must go.

0:24:26.640,0:24:35.640
Because I had the knowledge of what the problem was and what this woman of God had told us, I never gave up.

0:24:35.640,0:24:37.980
Okay, just tell us

0:24:37.980,0:24:44.640
When you first met yeah for how long was the relationship going really well. For two years. For two years.

0:24:44.640,0:24:49.240
And then at what point, did you realize that it was a spiritual problem.

0:24:49.240,0:24:54.040
and it was not normal at what point. Two years and then

0:24:54.040,0:25:01.920
when I decided to marry her, when I proposed to her. I took out somewhere to propose to her, I brought a ring.

0:25:01.920,0:25:09.440
She said, guy, it is difficult for her to get this ring. She loves me, but she has no affection for me.

0:25:09.440,0:25:16.700
She loved me, she called me good names but she has no affection for me.

0:25:16.700,0:25:24.400
That woman of God told us a lot of things. There is one fundamental thing the woman said that kept me moving.

0:25:24.400,0:25:28.380
When she complained of no affection, the woman said if I

0:25:28.380,0:25:33.220
marry her affection will come.

0:25:33.220,0:25:39.600
So if we leave the prayer place and go to where we were running around,

0:25:39.600,0:25:41.259
She would agree.

0:25:41.260,0:25:45.720
Few days after she would say no.

0:25:45.720,0:25:53.860
All the events that were happening between us, I just new that it was not normal.

0:25:53.860,0:25:59.235
Let me just quickly shift in, there, at the point where he says, I agreed and and than I said no.

0:25:59.240,0:26:01.380
When we got to this woman, she is a prophetess

0:26:01.380,0:26:08.080
that I fellowship with. So when he said we should go to the herbalist, I said we should go to the woman

0:26:08.080,0:26:10.960
there was something she said to me. She said

0:26:10.960,0:26:16.700
if I don't get married to my husband then I'll never get married in my life.

0:26:16.700,0:26:22.820
And so I had all of this going through my mind: so if I don't get married to this man

0:26:22.820,0:26:24.560
I'm not going to get married.

0:26:24.560,0:26:31.880
Because when I went to her I was confused and I told her that please I want to know if this man is my husband,

0:26:31.880,0:26:34.100
that is exactly what took me in there

0:26:34.100,0:26:36.650
So when when we finally got there?

0:26:36.650,0:26:38.240
She told me that any man

0:26:38.240,0:26:45.940
I would bring to the church that was my husband and eventually I was taking my husband then not

0:26:45.940,0:26:52.200
as my husband, but because of the problems we had and he discovered it at the herbalist,

0:26:52.200,0:26:53.840
And  I told him that

0:26:53.840,0:26:57.650
let seek the face of God which I had as an alternative,  getting there,

0:26:57.650,0:27:02.940
and then she telling me that if I don't get married to this man. I was never going to get married.

0:27:02.940,0:27:07.600
That's also compounded my problem. You know to think  of it

0:27:07.600,0:27:10.780
my flesh is saying no to this man, the same times the

0:27:10.780,0:27:14.180
Prophetess who sees better than I do, is telling me that if I don't get married to this man

0:27:14.180,0:27:20.420
I will never get married, so it compounded my problem, and made me act the way I did off

0:27:20.420,0:27:23.560
You know, I would say yesterday, say no tomorrow.

0:27:23.560,0:27:30.340
Like that. So three days to our traditional marriage, I was at her house.

0:27:30.340,0:27:37.960
About some time, we were her father, her mother, myself and her.

0:27:37.960,0:27:42.800
We were arranging how the next three days would be.

0:27:42.800,0:27:45.620
She told her mother in my presence,

0:27:45.620,0:27:53.040
if the mother agreed, the mother would go, to marry me and she walked out on me the father and mother.

0:27:53.040,0:27:54.300
Angrily

0:27:54.300,0:27:59.700
I took my car,  went to town, had seven bottles of beer that

0:27:59.700,0:28:05.060
was about 11:00 p.m.. From Bokodos who have been to Makadi

0:28:05.060,0:28:12.620
that from bokodo to  Makadi, I almost killed myself. I ran into a

0:28:12.620,0:28:18.220
ditch. I was drunk.

0:28:18.220,0:28:26.800
I tried to dodge a trailer, I ran into that pit and I stayed there up to 2 a.m.. I drove to Makadi.

0:28:26.800,0:28:29.840
6:30 in the morning ,a friend of mine

0:28:29.840,0:28:32.700
was very much close to us

0:28:32.700,0:28:36.140
knew that I have gone to arrange  for the next three days, came to the house

0:28:36.140,0:28:41.480
And I told him the story. He told me there was  a pastor we supposed to go see.

0:28:41.480,0:28:43.900
6:37  I was in  that pastor's church.

0:28:43.900,0:28:48.240
The next thing, another friend of mine was calling me,

0:28:48.240,0:28:54.400
And then eventually, the guy drove to Makodi  and I showed him where I was, in the church.

0:28:54.400,0:29:02.460
When he came and I saw my wife with him. This is not the woman who said that she will not come. What is she

0:29:02.460,0:29:08.700
doing here? I abandoned that pastor and came back home because my wife has said that we couldn't

0:29:08.700,0:29:13.820
get married. When we reach home, she said: boy, I won't do it again.

0:29:13.820,0:29:19.360
Ok! Tell us, Mr Peter, at that point in time, when your wife to be,

0:29:19.360,0:29:23.120
told you, she was no longer interested in marring you, three days to the wedding.

0:29:23.120,0:29:26.700
Actually, what was your reaction then. I wanted to make history.

0:29:26.700,0:29:34.280
Hmm, I wanted to make history. I wanted to make a history that a beautiful girl, a queen

0:29:34.280,0:29:35.420
you know,

0:29:35.430,0:29:36.930
queen like this,

0:29:36.930,0:29:40.760
a young man had come to marry her,

0:29:40.760,0:29:44.380
she refused to come out. I wanted to give her name.

0:29:44.380,0:29:49.960
So that other people would say off her: if you go to her she will run away. I also wanted to give him a name too.

0:29:49.960,0:29:55.280
So, I kept faith.

0:29:55.280,0:29:58.560
In fact it was

0:29:58.560,0:30:02.480
two days to our traditional marriage that

0:30:02.480,0:30:08.060
She agreed and came. We snapped pictures to give to people for souvenir, all that in only two days.

0:30:08.060,0:30:10.300
If you look at those pictures, they are very funny.

0:30:10.300,0:30:11.620
HELLISH MARRIAGE TURNED HEAVENLY

0:30:11.620,0:30:16.700
I am convinced, she has a tremendous respect for her father.

0:30:16.700,0:30:20.760
She has tremendous respect for her and she said he would

0:30:20.760,0:30:26.240
be disappointed in her because the parents, the younger ones, every body have accepted me in the house.

0:30:26.240,0:30:32.280
I didn't use charm on them. When I go there , they will hold me" good Peter".

0:30:32.280,0:30:38.080
The woman that I wanted to marry said now. Some how

0:30:38.080,0:30:40.900
we got married.

0:30:40.900,0:30:43.400
During our traditional marriage,

0:30:43.400,0:30:50.020
the whole, more than half of the church where we were going for prayers were at the back,

0:30:50.020,0:30:52.500
praying for us.

0:30:52.500,0:30:55.440
But a lot of things happened.

0:30:55.440,0:31:01.200
Within this time, we did some work and we had money somewhere.

0:31:01.200,0:31:04.380
The work that she was doing and I was doing,

0:31:04.380,0:31:09.560
she had some good money somewhere and the man who was owning us  refused to pay that money.

0:31:09.560,0:31:15.380
So we started looking for where to borrow, and then, you know, God has a way of doing things.

0:31:15.380,0:31:20.100
It will be closed to where we would fail then  God would open up a small way.

0:31:20.100,0:31:27.360
Okay, so you finally got married after your marriage? What were the challenges and issues you were facing?

0:31:27.360,0:31:28.590
Yeah!

0:31:28.590,0:31:33.000
If I began to say or discuss the challenges I faced

0:31:33.000,0:31:34.980
we will not leave here.

0:31:34.980,0:31:42.140
But the remarkable, I married this beautiful queen.

0:31:42.140,0:31:50.760
For three to four months, I had not met her as husband and wises. We were living in the room like toys.

0:31:50.760,0:31:56.520
To a point, I had to call  a woman in my office to talk to her.

0:31:56.520,0:31:58.340
But,

0:31:58.340,0:32:03.060
there was no change.

0:32:03.060,0:32:08.480
She is very intelligent that I will no dispute she started

0:32:08.480,0:32:11.700
living a plastic life with me.

0:32:11.700,0:32:14.760
She wanted it, but you know

0:32:14.760,0:32:17.200
What you're not being from your heart

0:32:17.200,0:32:20.260
at a point where you are about to do it,

0:32:20.260,0:32:25.140
anger would come. Anger would set in and the feeling would disappear.

0:32:25.140,0:32:33.840
That led me into massive, massive intake of alcohol

0:32:33.840,0:32:36.500
I've married. I sat her down.

0:32:36.500,0:32:41.580
I had paid a bride price. I had told God at  church that you, are my wife,

0:32:41.580,0:32:44.520
why can't I meet you as husband and wife ?

0:32:44.520,0:32:53.800
So I went into massive drinking. My office was supposed to start by 8:00 8:30. I would leave the house 7 o' clock.

0:32:53.800,0:33:00.120
The first place I would visit would be a beer parlor sometimes I ended up not going to the office.

0:33:00.120,0:33:07.040
I would stay, I would drink. Some days, I would come back, some days sometimes,

0:33:07.040,0:33:12.180
I would come back two days after, three days after

0:33:12.180,0:33:15.280
same clothes. I had taken

0:33:15.280,0:33:21.140
alcohol this part of the town, to morrow, I will drive  the other part of the town, same clothes so those

0:33:21.140,0:33:27.180
people who saw me yesterday in those clothes would see me in this side. i they get there I'm in another part.

0:33:27.180,0:33:33.980
and then when I get home I

0:33:33.980,0:33:38.140
created an environment Where she could not ask me Where I was coming from.

0:33:38.140,0:33:44.180
Because I told her:" you had sent me away from the house, so you have no right to ask me where I'm coming

0:33:44.180,0:33:46.420
from". I come home and bath. I

0:33:46.420,0:33:53.680
developed a technique of moving up with a bag in my car so that I would have  a problem of changing

0:33:53.680,0:33:57.520
my clothes. I would drink.

0:33:57.520,0:34:05.960
Sometimes I would sit in the beer parlor but  I would not be drinking but I would not go home. I had that capacity

0:34:05.960,0:34:11.400
to drink from morning to night. Morning till the other day break.

0:34:11.400,0:34:15.280
I know joints that start by 10:00 p.m.

0:34:15.280,0:34:20.960
So when I finish the joints are close by 9:00 or 10:00. I moved to the one that start by 10:00 p.m.

0:34:20.960,0:34:22.430
to 6:00 a.m..

0:34:22.430,0:34:27.620
I invested my money into alcohol and

0:34:27.620,0:34:33.880
the devil has a way of doing things. It's the past I will say it.  The devil has a way of doing things.

0:34:33.880,0:34:36.880
He will lead you to those friends that

0:34:36.880,0:34:45.660
will add to your predicaments. But you will thing in your own foolish way that you are doing good to yourself.

0:34:45.660,0:34:48.620
Because they will celebrate you.

0:34:48.620,0:34:56.880
However, they knew that if they called me, they would give me one, two bottles and I would offer a carton.

0:34:56.880,0:35:01.680
Because they knew that I was never tired and I said I wanted to go home.

0:35:01.680,0:35:08.160
So those are the kind of friends that the devil brought into my life at that time I

0:35:08.160,0:35:16.160
was into drinking. Even after my University in 2006-2007, I was very slim like you are.

0:35:16.160,0:35:18.620
When I got married I

0:35:18.620,0:35:21.640
didn't even give her the opportunity of

0:35:21.640,0:35:24.620
telling me something. There was no joy.

0:35:24.620,0:35:28.840
And that's why you find out a lot of young people,

0:35:28.840,0:35:34.360
today, you see them in beer parlors. Find out about their home, something is wrong.

0:35:34.360,0:35:42.880
It has happened to me. I has happened to me, and that had actually gave us troubles

0:35:42.880,0:35:48.660
I knew that she hated the test of alcohol, that was my best friend.

0:35:48.660,0:35:56.400
Alcohol became my best friend. When I came I want to hurt her. She would not ask me.

0:35:56.400,0:36:04.940
It came to a point if I got home, I would ask her:"what are you even doing in this house?

0:36:04.940,0:36:13.800
What are you doing in this house, pack your things and leave and I give me space.

0:36:13.800,0:36:17.360
You know and

0:36:17.360,0:36:24.220
I would said that I bless God today. I bless God today. She is a wonderful woman.

0:36:24.220,0:36:27.860
A woman who had married a man who you had no affection for,

0:36:27.860,0:36:34.040
then you lived in the room with that person for three years. It's not three days we're talking about.

0:36:34.040,0:36:36.100
We did these three years,

0:36:36.100,0:36:37.740
I could count

0:36:37.740,0:36:41.380
while I am sitting here, I can tell you  how many times we smiled.

0:36:41.380,0:36:44.740
True smile with each other. I can tell you.

0:36:44.740,0:36:46.860
Three years.

0:36:46.860,0:36:48.380
Okay, Mr. Peter,

0:36:48.380,0:36:51.020
can I just ask you a quick question. Despite all the

0:36:51.020,0:36:54.560
difficulties you were passing through, you were facing what convinced

0:36:54.560,0:37:01.580
you not to give up on the marriage? Because even those in the witch craft told me that if my wife is fully delivered

0:37:01.580,0:37:04.780
I'm going to enjoy my home.

0:37:04.780,0:37:07.440
But the devil, actually,

0:37:07.440,0:37:13.780
blindfolded me not to seek God in the right way, not to seek to redeem my marriage in the right way.

0:37:13.780,0:37:19.580
I will visit one native doctor to the other, they would tell me the same thing.

0:37:19.580,0:37:29.820
I would visit the man of God who can give professes, they would tell me the same thing but the problem will remain.

0:37:29.820,0:37:34.200
The perfect way, made me moving was moving is God.

0:37:34.200,0:37:39.980
God wanted to do a new thing in our lives. God wanted to use me

0:37:39.980,0:37:46.080
as young couple to teach the world like we are teaching them now.

0:37:46.080,0:37:50.300
To let them know that it is better and best in Christ,

0:37:50.300,0:37:51.600
no matter the challenges.

0:37:51.600,0:37:54.560
We went through a lot to a point

0:37:54.560,0:38:00.060
I look at the girl. I also had a word" less privilege"

0:38:00.060,0:38:03.080
Not less privilege because you were from a poor home,

0:38:03.080,0:38:04.280
but

0:38:04.280,0:38:10.380
you are not to the standard of my own woman and I would get close to you and you would appreciate me.

0:38:10.380,0:38:15.660
I would look at the one that was more than her, I get close a good to her and she would appreciate me.

0:38:15.660,0:38:20.160
And then I knew that something was actually wrong in my home.

0:38:20.160,0:38:26.980
Today, I am celebrating her as a mother of my children that are coming.

0:38:26.980,0:38:29.460
This hat that she has,

0:38:29.460,0:38:36.960
my daughter is going to have part of it because it is not easy for a woman who had no affection for you

0:38:36.960,0:38:39.340
to endure for three years,

0:38:39.340,0:38:40.900
three years.

0:38:40.900,0:38:47.460
Whoever will tell you that go home manage. Ah !at the end of the day, it was  two of us.

0:38:47.460,0:38:50.820
A child didn't come in these three years so nothing to divert the attention

0:38:50.820,0:38:55.360
from me. Can you tell us,

0:38:55.360,0:39:00.600
You mentioned, earlier, that you separated for five months, what led you to

0:39:00.600,0:39:05.180
finally seeking the face of God at the synagogue Church of All Nations

0:39:05.180,0:39:09.560
between you and your wife. Our God is a merciful God,

0:39:09.560,0:39:12.160
very merciful God.

0:39:12.160,0:39:18.630
We lived in Makodi, me and her alone in that house. When I would leave the house for three days I would

0:39:18.630,0:39:21.740
no come back. She would stay in the house  alone.

0:39:21.740,0:39:23.940
So when she left I

0:39:23.940,0:39:33.380
decided to stay indoors, and I regretted every minute of what I did to her.

0:39:33.380,0:39:39.280
This small girl inside this house, all alone.

0:39:39.280,0:39:45.400
I remember some instance where I would come back, hoot at the gate. She would humbly come, 2: am.

0:39:45.400,0:39:51.660
and I would scold that at the turn of the road she supposed to know the sound of my car.

0:39:51.660,0:39:58.380
Within this time I sent her text messages that I regretted. She didn't respond to any of them.

0:39:58.380,0:40:03.880
We did speak to each other for 37 days. I was counting

0:40:03.880,0:40:09.920
I knew the circumstances that led to certain things, actually, told me that something was wrong.

0:40:09.920,0:40:13.420
On my wedding day I had accident. On my wedding day.

0:40:13.420,0:40:17.670
Nobody was driving the car. I parked the car, was talking to somebody and the car started moving.

0:40:17.670,0:40:22.300
I had an accident. When she parked out of  my house.

0:40:22.300,0:40:27.440
And I wanted to find out where she was at her house. I had an accident.

0:40:27.440,0:40:31.948
So a lot of things happened that affected us were not normal.

0:40:31.948,0:40:35.260
That how I said let us seek the face of God

0:40:35.260,0:40:39.800
I appreciated the pastors that prayed for us. They did a wonderful job.

0:40:39.800,0:40:46.080
But I think God was preparing us to give us a testimony. Here we are today.

0:40:46.080,0:40:48.960
And so I have Emmanuetv in the house.

0:40:48.960,0:40:56.960
I have seen senior prophet TB Joshua, a humble man, reconciles homes.

0:40:56.960,0:40:59.060
Wonderful homes. There was a man

0:40:59.060,0:41:03.500
who was separated from his wife for 30 years or 35 years

0:41:03.500,0:41:06.860
He reconciled them. God was able to locate them.

0:41:06.860,0:41:11.140
It was when she left that all this start coming to me,

0:41:11.140,0:41:13.000
started coming to me.

0:41:13.000,0:41:20.500
And so she has one thing, anywhere is God, she would go. Any way the name of God is mentioned she would

0:41:20.500,0:41:29.460
go. We were discussing and she told me that she's tired of going into prayer houses.

0:41:29.460,0:41:37.140
The only place she would go, if it is synagogue she was ready.

0:41:37.140,0:41:42.360
That was when our finances

0:41:42.360,0:41:48.900
grounded. The devil knew that if we got here would be set free.

0:41:48.900,0:41:54.720
Every other person I discusses with: why do you need to go to synagogue,  don't we have synagogue in Makadi.

0:41:54.720,0:42:01.460
Those pastors have been praying for us. My wife used to be unreasonable. I never give up.

0:42:01.460,0:42:05.940
So I did all I could .

0:42:05.940,0:42:09.580
I left pleasure to seek God and

0:42:09.580,0:42:12.840
eventually we got here.

0:42:12.840,0:42:16.020
When we got here something significant  happened.

0:42:16.020,0:42:19.800
Something that, Oh God,I can't buy it .

0:42:19.800,0:42:26.340
I want to dance every minute. You won't understand the peace I have in my heart today.

0:42:26.340,0:42:36.340
I'm like, I'm already feeling like a billionaire because peace in my heart

0:42:36.340,0:42:40.600
When I came, I came with a stone in my heart

0:42:40.600,0:42:48.080
If you looked at me, you would know that I was not happy. To a point I was like I was going made.

0:42:48.080,0:42:51.760
I could wear  bedroom slippers and

0:42:51.760,0:42:55.860
go outside the house something I never did before.

0:42:55.860,0:43:03.880
If your home is not settled , you are gone. You can never find peace.

0:43:03.880,0:43:12.460
How did you feel when you saw that your wife was receiving deliverance. Oh! my greatness!

0:43:12.460,0:43:17.440
You know, something happened,

0:43:17.440,0:43:23.980
all the people who prayed for my wife. She said amen. I said amen.

0:43:23.980,0:43:25.980
Troubles remained.

0:43:25.980,0:43:27.079
Immediately,

0:43:27.080,0:43:33.160
the man God, you know, I was lucky that I got the touch from the man of God before her.

0:43:33.160,0:43:38.580
So when I got that touch, I felt relief instantly. It's not magic.

0:43:38.580,0:43:41.040
It's not magic

0:43:41.040,0:43:46.200
It's not magic. I felt relief .so I was walking happily out

0:43:46.200,0:43:50.760
and then I heard a sound and when I turned to the television that was very close to me,

0:43:50.760,0:43:55.400
I saw my wife manifesting and I said thank you Jesus.

0:43:55.400,0:44:01.940
Immediately I saw that I said, thank you Jesus. I knew that the end had come.

0:44:01.940,0:44:05.160
The end of our troubles had come

0:44:05.160,0:44:10.320
So when she came out I pretended, I

0:44:10.320,0:44:12.840
pretended, she could not hold it

0:44:12.840,0:44:15.700
You know from

0:44:15.700,0:44:19.800
the deliverance point to the hotel where we were staying

0:44:19.800,0:44:26.160
She held my hand. I said Jesus. What is happening. Is this is real?

0:44:26.160,0:44:33.020
So we went home,  she wanted us to pray, and she asked me to lead the prayer

0:44:33.020,0:44:35.400
I said: I'm so tired, she should pray.

0:44:35.400,0:44:46.540
She said a very short prayer. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you Jesus, and I said amen.

0:44:46.540,0:44:50.560
We all slept like babies.

0:44:50.560,0:44:54.700
She woke up. I didn't know that she woke up before me.

0:44:54.700,0:45:00.200
When I woke up, I saw her seating on the bed, she was looking at me.

0:45:00.200,0:45:12.460
Those eyes that I turned and I looked at her, that first day in bed, after the deliverance, touched my heart.

0:45:12.460,0:45:16.220
She said one thing that finished.

0:45:16.220,0:45:22.780
She said thank you for not giving up, and I said, thank you for enduring too.

0:45:22.780,0:45:29.920
That was the beginning. That was the day I wedded my wife.

0:45:29.920,0:45:36.440
Would ask yourselves that if it was before, she would, say smelly mouth, without approaching me.

0:45:36.440,0:45:42.740
She kissed me that morning. I said:" Jesus. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow."

0:45:42.740,0:45:45.440
That how it was.  if it was before

0:45:45.440,0:45:48.140
smelly mouth, please excuse me.

0:45:48.140,0:45:54.300
She had kissed me that early morning kiss without brushing.

0:45:54.300,0:46:00.420
And I knew that God has finally visited my home.

0:46:00.420,0:46:04.680
God has finally visited my home.

0:46:04.680,0:46:10.760
It has been wonderful, and, I thank God that I never gave up. If I had missed this woman,

0:46:10.760,0:46:15.120
I don't think I would found another woman in this world better than who she is.

0:46:15.120,0:46:18.880
Thank you so much. You are welcome sir.

0:46:18.880,0:46:25.320
To God be the Glory. So now tell us, how is the marriage now after the deliverance?

0:46:25.320,0:46:31.620
If I start telling you, now, the  experiences of  one or two weeks, we will not live here.

0:46:31.620,0:46:37.940
Do you know, we're now praying together, we eat together. While walking on the road together.

0:46:37.940,0:46:43.200
When we were coming here, I didn't know that she was carrying a Roman soldier hair.

0:46:43.200,0:46:51.800
Only after the deliverance I admired her. I wanted to be sure of what has happened.

0:46:51.800,0:46:57.280
I would pretend and I leave the hotel go behind and stay there.

0:46:57.280,0:47:02.500
Five minutes, ten minutes, she would call me I want to go buy something. Please where are you? Come back!

0:47:02.500,0:47:10.140
But this come back now was more realistic than that of when it was plastic.

0:47:10.140,0:47:14.600
When it was plastic. Now, I am enjoying my home.

0:47:14.600,0:47:20.900
She is no longer abusing me that I have a potbelly. She will walk at my side and tell me that our stomach.

0:47:20.900,0:47:24.660
Before my ,now, it's our.

0:47:24.660,0:47:27.320
You know, it is so good.

0:47:27.320,0:47:34.380
If we didn't have any discussions at all, now, we can bring a topic from the Bible and discuss.

0:47:34.380,0:47:41.380
It is not like there are no challenges at all. They are there those that are not important.

0:47:41.380,0:47:50.680
If it was before, consciously now,I am trying to offend her to see her reaction. She's a wonderful a woman.

0:47:50.680,0:47:57.490
Thank God for this deliverance, we can really say that, it's a new marriage now. Yeah! But yourself, as well,

0:47:57.490,0:48:03.760
you had that problem of drinking alcohol. You said you could drink from morning to night after the prayer,

0:48:03.760,0:48:10.300
do you still have the urge to drink alcohol?After the prayers, the next day,

0:48:10.300,0:48:15.440
we were living our hotel to get something on the road, I saw people drinking and I said; see, look at those fools.

0:48:15.440,0:48:17.720
They're fooling themselves.

0:48:17.720,0:48:21.940
On top of that, one pulled his shirt. I said God! Jesus!

0:48:21.940,0:48:25.100
So this is what I was doing?

0:48:25.100,0:48:27.420
I hate the smell of alcohol now.

0:48:27.420,0:48:31.840
Those who are watching EmmanuelTV in my state and are watching me,

0:48:31.840,0:48:34.220
they will celebrate

0:48:34.220,0:48:36.380
because they know that

0:48:36.380,0:48:38.320
if me I can

0:48:38.320,0:48:44.860
come and tell the world that I am no longer drinking alcohol. Thousands of people will stop drinking alcohol.

0:48:44.860,0:48:48.000
I'm telling you.

0:48:48.000,0:48:55.920
Because, I know what the devil did. He spoiled my home completely. He spoiled my home completely.

0:48:55.920,0:48:59.660
So now, absolutely there is peace.

0:48:59.660,0:49:01.980
You know, you can't fake peace.

0:49:01.980,0:49:04.540
I can't fake it. There is peace.

0:49:04.540,0:49:08.940
You know, I, now, understand why people in Synagogue...

0:49:08.940,0:49:13.880
I'm not saying that those who prayed for us before  didn't do well.

0:49:13.880,0:49:20.040
They did their part. God wanted us to get our deliverance to be where we are today.

0:49:20.040,0:49:25.300
We thank God Almighty for this radical transformation that has come in your marriage.

0:49:25.300,0:49:31.580
And we know our viewers are watching and we know they have been blessed by all

0:49:31.580,0:49:38.940
you have shared with them, and they also have question, they would like to ask you .

0:49:38.940,0:49:46.380
You will may be answer them and share more light on what you're saying.

0:49:46.380,0:49:51.080
We have a question from one of our viewers and

0:49:51.080,0:49:52.580
It says

0:49:52.580,0:50:00.060
My name is Calista from New Zealand and the question goes to you mr.. Peter it says

0:50:00.060,0:50:04.280
When crisis hits your marriage you ran to alcohol,

0:50:04.280,0:50:12.080
So like many do, so what did you learn from that and what advice can you give to others about that?

0:50:12.080,0:50:16.780
Yeah, what I learnt from there is that

0:50:16.780,0:50:20.040
when crisis hits you, run to God.

0:50:20.040,0:50:27.400
Okay. When you run to alcohol or to any of these earthly things you will destroy yourself and your soul.

0:50:27.400,0:50:29.980
I went through it, I destroyed myself,

0:50:29.980,0:50:36.780
my finances, my peace at home and all that. Finally, we ran to Christ, today, we are celebrating to Christ, today,

0:50:36.780,0:50:41.240
I'm celebrating because I have fully got Christ.

0:50:41.240,0:50:43.400
Nobody,

0:50:43.400,0:50:49.340
nobody should deceive you that when you have crisis run to alcohol, you will forget it.

0:50:49.340,0:50:57.560
For one minute you forget it, the next minute, it will come more. It rather increases your crisis.

0:50:57.560,0:51:01.360
Today, I have known that life without Christ is crisis.

0:51:01.360,0:51:04.800
Life with Christ is absolute peace,

0:51:04.800,0:51:07.980
absolute  peace.

0:51:07.980,0:51:11.600
Okay, so we have

0:51:11.600,0:51:17.520
another question and it's for both of you. It's from Steve from Canada and

0:51:17.520,0:51:18.990
he says:

0:51:18.990,0:51:22.800
me and my partner have been dating for more than a year now.

0:51:22.800,0:51:30.380
And we are looking to tie the knot, what advice do you have for us?

0:51:30.380,0:51:33.420
Firstly, I will say:

0:51:33.420,0:51:39.160
Yet you tie the knots you should avail yourself for deliverance.

0:51:39.160,0:51:41.320
Buy that I mean,

0:51:41.320,0:51:47.120
probably you feel, you're alright,physically. there's nothing wrong with you, and of course the both of you

0:51:47.120,0:51:53.040
are enjoying yourself, but I'm just telling you this even gold passes through fire

0:51:53.040,0:51:55.180
to be what it is.

0:51:55.180,0:52:00.920
So you shouldn't think all is rose, all is okay. He's just

0:52:00.920,0:52:11.120
by the side of everything. Avail both of you for deliverance, first, before going into the marriage.

0:52:11.120,0:52:18.640
Yeah, and for those who are married, already, all of us, need deliverance,

0:52:18.640,0:52:26.640
all of us need deliverance. You may be fooling yourself thinking that mr. A is the problem mr. B is the problem

0:52:26.640,0:52:29.100
There's a spirit behind

0:52:29.100,0:52:31.780
every circumstances that happens

0:52:31.780,0:52:36.420
in our lives. Today, I can testify to that,

0:52:36.420,0:52:38.860
just to say your husband to be

0:52:38.860,0:52:45.940
is a problem, it's a problem or your wife. I wrongly accused my wife.

0:52:45.940,0:52:48.680
Even though all of us needed deliverance.

0:52:48.680,0:52:51.980
But that should not happen physically with them,

0:52:51.980,0:52:54.640
they rather seek God for deliverance.

0:52:54.640,0:53:01.320
Once you get delivered every other things  come your way. Today, I'm enjoying it. I

0:53:01.320,0:53:03.921
I wish had taken this time years back.

0:53:03.921,0:53:08.220
But God's time said to be the best, so this is His time.

0:53:08.220,0:53:11.540
so I appreciate  it. And

0:53:11.540,0:53:14.860
we were going for deliverance,

0:53:14.860,0:53:19.220
go for the deliverance in a life Spirit fit church.

0:53:19.220,0:53:22.100
If you are opportune come to synagogue.

0:53:22.100,0:53:29.460
Nobody should deceive you, nobody, this man is a man of God. I'm a practical example to that.

0:53:29.460,0:53:35.680
I can testify before the whole world today. He is a man who has never met me in his life before. He doesn't know

0:53:35.680,0:53:38.560
anything about us. I don't know anybody in synagogue.

0:53:38.560,0:53:40.400
But that touch

0:53:40.400,0:53:47.900
relieved my problem. I was coming to synagogue with my wife as a separated couple. Today, we kiss on the road.

0:53:47.900,0:53:49.800
She had said it from the beginning

0:53:49.800,0:53:57.000
that she never wanted to come back.  But today, we are sharing our experiences as

0:53:57.000,0:53:59.120
joyful moments.

0:53:59.120,0:54:06.480
Find a Spirit fit church, if you can't come to synagogue. We went to so many places and they had prayed for us,

0:54:06.480,0:54:11.120
Some became very angry with us that we refused to hear the word of God.

0:54:11.120,0:54:16.120
The fact that they had delivered us that we didn't want to do the work we needed to do.

0:54:16.120,0:54:18.900
That touch ,from TB.Joshua,

0:54:18.900,0:54:25.180
is the Spirit fit church. We are living testimony. We go back and testify

0:54:25.180,0:54:27.640
Thank you very much for

0:54:27.640,0:54:30.460
sharing your time with us, here, on changing lives,

0:54:30.460,0:54:36.800
absolute, incredible advice and this is a new marriage, now, in Christ Jesus and

0:54:36.800,0:54:40.000
wonderful advice. We believe this testimony is going to touch

0:54:40.000,0:54:44.060
millions of marriages and people that are about to be married

0:54:44.060,0:54:48.880
around the world as well. Thank you very much. Thank you for having us. We bless God.

0:54:48.880,0:54:53.260
Hellish Marriage Turned Heavenly

0:54:53.260,0:55:01.040
When you hear about marriage, it is more like something smooth, the bed of roses , fun

0:55:01.040,0:55:05.740
fair. There are so many things in stories you hear about people getting married how they go for honeymoon

0:55:05.740,0:55:09.200
and that was the dream for me like a young lady.

0:55:09.200,0:55:10.620
In 2013 when I decided to married her

0:55:10.620,0:55:16.400
that was the beginning of my troubles with my wife. We had fun times up to the moments

0:55:16.400,0:55:20.780
when he wanted to marry me. At that point, in time, when your wife to be the

0:55:20.780,0:55:24.540
told you she was no longer interested in marrying you, three days to the wedding.

0:55:24.540,0:55:31.840
what actually was your reaction, then? I wanted to make history. Just three days to my traditional marriage,

0:55:31.840,0:55:38.160
I told him bluntly, I'm not going to marry you. Just seeing him irritated me,

0:55:38.160,0:55:44.080
his size structure, I hated it. I was like you with this belly pot where are you going too.

0:55:44.080,0:55:50.460
What was your experience when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you? As soon as prophet pray for me

0:55:50.460,0:55:55.710
there was something different. I'am now missing him. Just like when he steps outside, I will be like; hey, boy,

0:55:55.710,0:56:01.120
where are you? We had this problem  of quarreling, we didn't agree , we were always

0:56:01.120,0:56:05.860
arguing. You are always irritated, you don't love your husband, you don't admire him. You thing may be the

0:56:05.860,0:56:14.960
feeling is normal. I'm here to tell them that it is not normal. There is something wrong somewhere.

0:56:14.960,0:56:16.440
Well, what a wonderful

0:56:16.440,0:56:18.900
testimony in the life of mr. And mrs

0:56:18.900,0:56:22.820
IPUSU and we believe that there are many lessons that you learned from it.

0:56:22.820,0:56:29.100
You know that unfavorable situations are the great arguments that Satan uses to make children of God

0:56:29.100,0:56:34.180
to question their sonship, question their marriage and other areas of their life, and even question if what they

0:56:34.180,0:56:40.540
are doing is the will of God in their lives. The fact that you are a child of God does not eliminate

0:56:40.540,0:56:47.560
adversity such as the circumstances that happened in their marriage, but rather being a child of God

0:56:47.560,0:56:50.200
turns that adversity into an opportunity

0:56:50.200,0:56:54.940
for God to manifest His glory in that situation. Yes viewers,

0:56:54.940,0:56:59.300
we believe, you had seen in their experience that God can use any situation,

0:56:59.300,0:57:07.500
I mean, any foolish thing for his purpose and bring good out of evil. What seems like evil in the face of the painful

0:57:07.500,0:57:10.400
experience of chronic disagreements

0:57:10.400,0:57:18.160
disgust and hatred were eventually used by God to strengthen their determination and desire for Him.

0:57:18.160,0:57:26.060
Yes, what Satan meant for bad, God made it work for good. This testimony taught us that we need to rest in a

0:57:26.060,0:57:33.900
place that God has for us, so that His Grace can cover us. So if you find yourself in a situation that is contrary

0:57:33.900,0:57:36.580
to your expectations in Christ don't budge,

0:57:36.580,0:57:41.920
don't pull out, stay put and get used to that situation so that you can gain the necessary experience,

0:57:41.920,0:57:47.800
and maturity to handle the responsibilities in Christ. So viewers

0:57:47.800,0:57:51.720
whatever situation you are facing in your marriage should not break it,

0:57:51.720,0:57:59.940
rather strengthen it and your marriage can only be strengthened by you running to Jesus Christ for He is the Great

0:57:59.940,0:58:05.520
deliverer. Thank you very much for joining us on Changing Lives. My name is Justin and my name is

0:58:05.520,0:58:13.620

0:58:13.620,0:58:16.420

and also viewers,

0:58:17.720,0:58:24.840
We know you also have a testimony to share, you can send us your testimony through I.emmanuel.TV

0:58:24.840,0:58:32.000
We want to listen to your testimonies, because we believe your own testimony can also bless others.
