The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:09.020,0:00:11.600
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:11.600,0:00:14.780
Hallelujah!

0:00:14.780,0:00:22.540
I will not look at your appearance, the way you dance

0:00:22.540,0:00:28.140
or the testimony you have given to judge you.

0:00:28.140,0:00:30.460
We need to examine all these.

0:00:30.460,0:00:42.020
Do you want me to judge you by your dancing, appearance, which is very admirable.

0:00:42.020,0:00:43.900
Let's look beyond that.

0:00:43.900,0:00:45.500
Hallelujah!

0:00:45.500,0:00:47.780
That is why we are here today.

0:00:47.780,0:00:56.700
We cannot just say, "Oh my God, what a wonderful man" by mere looking at their appearance.

0:00:56.700,0:00:59.300
That is why we are here today.

0:00:59.300,0:01:03.580
You cannot just say, "Hey", because you smile.

0:01:03.580,0:01:06.260
Are you such in heart?

0:01:06.260,0:01:08.020
Hallelujah!

0:01:08.020,0:01:13.800
Viewers all over the world, thank you for your time.

0:01:13.800,0:01:16.000
We salute your faith.

0:01:16.000,0:01:24.860
Putting everything behind and saying, "Yes, you believe - something is about to happen,

0:01:24.860,0:01:32.860
something that will change your steps, your direction, your focus".

0:01:32.860,0:01:36.040
Wow! It is going to happen.

0:01:36.040,0:01:37.560
Hallelujah!

0:01:41.080,0:01:43.940
Our message today:

0:01:43.940,0:01:48.060
COMMITMENT ENHANCES FAITH

0:01:48.060,0:01:53.320
You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a total commitment.

0:01:53.320,0:02:00.100
Everywhere; what has happened in this nation, has happened in another nation.

0:02:00.100,0:02:08.560
Economic oppression, religious oppression, political oppression - everywhere.

0:02:08.560,0:02:10.480
We are still on it.

0:02:10.480,0:02:17.940
Today we will take our reading from John 15; that will be the proof text.

0:02:17.940,0:02:23.620
After reading John 15, we have some other Books that will help you;

0:02:23.620,0:02:37.260
the Book of Luke 14:26-27 - this is also very important to this message we are about to deliver today.

0:02:37.260,0:02:44.240
And the Book of Matthew 16:24.

0:02:44.240,0:02:53.820
And the Book of John 3:18 - it is also very vital, important for you.

0:02:53.820,0:02:57.180
I'm reading the Book of John as a proof text today.

0:02:57.180,0:03:05.820
If I may take the title of this text, "The World Hates The Disciples".

0:03:05.820,0:03:07.260
Are you there?

0:03:07.260,0:03:11.140
'The World Hates The Disciples'

0:03:11.140,0:03:17.640
And you are one of the disciples of Jesus, the follower of Jesus.

0:03:17.640,0:03:21.660
It means you are one of the followers.

0:03:21.660,0:03:26.740
That is just the summary of what we are about to talk about today.

0:03:26.740,0:03:30.220
So, now, I'm taking reading from verse 18.

0:03:30.220,0:03:46.300
“If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.”

0:03:46.300,0:03:52.600
Like what is happening to many of us today, "This is so much trouble".

0:03:52.600,0:04:04.020
Your Father too had similar challenges - our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:04:04.020,0:04:12.320
“If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own."

0:04:12.320,0:04:19.080
If you are one of the people, they will love you because you are one of them.

0:04:19.080,0:04:23.480
“As it is, you do not belong to the world."

0:04:23.480,0:04:27.380
Are you sure you are not one of them?
That is the question.

0:04:27.380,0:04:35.600
“As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.”

0:04:35.600,0:04:45.440
We are in the world but we are not part of it.

0:04:45.440,0:04:52.860
If you are a follower, though you are in the world but you are not part.

0:04:52.860,0:04:55.020
That is what the Bible says here.

0:04:55.020,0:04:58.760
That is why the world hates you.

0:04:58.760,0:05:04.260
That is why they will hate you – because you are not part of it.

0:05:04.260,0:05:07.500
Everything that stands for the world...

0:05:07.500,0:05:19.100
There is a barrier between us and everything here in the world, if you are a disciple.

0:05:19.100,0:05:27.980
There is a barrier between us and everything here in the world.

0:05:27.980,0:05:30.500
We are now in verse 20.

0:05:30.500,0:05:32.960
“Remember what I told you…”

0:05:32.960,0:05:36.380
Come on - this is our Lord Jesus Christ:

0:05:36.380,0:05:43.540
“Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master’.”

0:05:43.540,0:05:47.260
Who is our master? Jesus.

0:05:47.260,0:05:51.860
Take your reading from 18 to the end.

0:05:51.860,0:05:57.520
John 3, verse 18 - very very important for you,

0:05:57.520,0:06:06.520
and Matthew 16 - that will really help you; from verse 24, you take your reading to verse 27.

0:06:06.520,0:06:18.760
Basically, with what we have read, we need to give up our life here on earth

0:06:18.760,0:06:25.920
and gain eternal life in Heaven.

0:06:25.920,0:06:34.880
There are two key words Jesus is explaining in that text.

0:06:34.880,0:06:51.720
The moment we become identified or accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour genuinely,

0:06:51.720,0:06:57.260
take note of the word 'genuinely',

0:06:57.260,0:07:06.740
then the world will hate us.

0:07:06.740,0:07:16.360
But if you have not received it genuinely; there is a counterfeit, fake -  everybody claims to be born again...

0:07:16.360,0:07:29.020
The evidence that you received Him genuinely – the world will hate you.

0:07:29.020,0:07:34.540
That you received Jesus genuinely, truly...

0:07:34.540,0:07:37.960
You know, when they hate you - you know what it means.

0:07:37.960,0:07:42.300
The world will hate you.

0:07:42.300,0:07:57.000
The world, which is currently under satanic control, will hate you.

0:07:57.000,0:08:05.800
It will hate you in the exact, same manner it hates Jesus.

0:08:05.800,0:08:15.340
Secondly, some of us would say, why should we suffer or die, after all

0:08:15.340,0:08:21.140
Jesus won the victory on the Cross and suffered for us.

0:08:21.140,0:08:29.240
Yes, He won the victory and suffered for me and you.

0:08:29.240,0:08:43.420
But the question we need to ask ourselves: What did Jesus say in John 15:20?

0:08:43.420,0:08:51.480
Jesus said, ‘The servant is not greater than his master’.

0:08:51.480,0:09:00.960
If they had persecuted Him, they will also persecute you.

0:09:00.960,0:09:09.720
Anyone who claims he is not to suffer because Jesus did it for him,

0:09:09.720,0:09:24.120
is actually contradicting what Jesus said – opposite to what Jesus said.

0:09:24.120,0:09:41.780
Like I have said, basically, we must give up our life here on earth and gain eternal life in Heaven.

0:09:41.780,0:09:43.000
In other words:

0:09:43.000,0:09:55.360
When you receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, you are accepting citizenship in Heaven

0:09:55.360,0:09:58.960
and death here on earth.

0:09:58.960,0:10:09.940
Total commitment is what Jesus demands throughout the Gospel.

0:10:09.940,0:10:22.900
This doctrine that says, “No suffering, no health challenges, no hardship”,

0:10:22.900,0:10:26.160
is evidence that you are not really saved.

0:10:26.160,0:10:32.000
By saying, "No hardship, no health challenges..."

0:10:32.000,0:10:45.280
A man can be sick in body and yet, be a candidate of Heaven, a friend of Jesus.

0:10:45.280,0:10:53.100
Allowing your situation to rule you – when you are sick, you begin to see Jesus in a bad light.

0:10:53.100,0:10:58.480
Our walking with the Lord is both good and hard times.

0:10:58.480,0:11:03.820
Yes - when the goings are good, and when the goings go the other way.

0:11:03.820,0:11:08.200
There is a lesson for good,

0:11:08.200,0:11:11.780
but the best lesson is when things are going the other way.

0:11:11.780,0:11:21.220
We learn best when things are going the other way than when things are going our way.

0:11:21.220,0:11:22.080
Tell your neighbour:

0:11:22.080,0:11:30.980
We learn best when things are going the other way than when things are going our way.

0:11:30.980,0:11:33.200
Why are you here today?

0:11:33.200,0:11:39.840
You are here because things don't seem to go your way.

0:11:39.840,0:11:43.740
If things were going your way, you would likely not know T.B. Joshua today,

0:11:43.740,0:11:46.240
you would likely not be here today.

0:11:46.240,0:11:51.960
"T.B. Joshua, I need an appointment to see you. Please, give me an appointment."

0:11:51.960,0:11:57.840
It means there is no association - just an appointment.

0:11:57.840,0:12:05.780
"T.B. Joshua, hello. I would like to have an appointment to see Mr T.B. Joshua - bishop" -

0:12:05.780,0:12:09.760
this is the name they call me outside there.

0:12:09.760,0:12:17.960
"I would like to have an appointment to see Bishop T.B. Joshua"

0:12:17.960,0:12:23.540
We cannot separate warfare from salvation.

0:12:23.540,0:12:26.440
That is the problem we are facing today.

0:12:26.440,0:12:30.300
We cannot what?

0:12:30.300,0:12:44.800
True salvation will put us into direct conflict with satan.

0:12:44.800,0:12:49.620
Because there is no true salvation...

0:12:49.620,0:12:53.700
Any moment from now, when we start, they fight both physical and spiritual.

0:12:53.700,0:13:04.140
They cannot stand me spiritually, but their leg goes here - sometimes I will be like this.

0:13:04.140,0:13:08.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:08.400,0:13:10.660
What are you saying?

0:13:10.660,0:13:14.720
Because I don't tell you what I'm facing - this flesh...

0:13:14.720,0:13:20.340
By the time I start now, I will do like this.

0:13:20.340,0:13:26.160
By the time they are manifesting, you will see them.

0:13:26.160,0:13:30.780
What do you think is the reason I don't put on a tie?

0:13:30.780,0:13:35.840
If they grabbed my tie, you would likely have...

0:13:35.840,0:13:38.980
I will call you to come and rescue the situation.

0:13:38.980,0:13:43.720
Not that they intentionally do that, but they have to fight back.

0:13:43.720,0:13:46.100
It is not intentional.

0:13:46.100,0:13:51.460
By the time they realize themselves, they say, "Oh, I'm very sorry, sir".

0:13:51.460,0:14:03.280
The day you make a total commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against satan.

0:14:03.280,0:14:06.960
I said total - not that kind we declare.

0:14:06.960,0:14:11.240
You are still wining and dining with these people.

0:14:11.240,0:14:25.280
The day you make a total commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against satan.

0:14:25.280,0:14:41.980
By identifying yourself with Jesus of Nazareth, you have made yourself a bitter enemy.

0:14:41.980,0:14:45.340
Oh my God.

0:14:45.340,0:15:16.620
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He went for me

0:15:16.620,0:15:29.280
Once Jesus purchases you, you become aliens here on earth – strangers.

0:15:29.280,0:15:32.780
You know a stranger?

0:15:32.780,0:15:39.360
Those who are staying in a country with no stay-permit, no working permit, nothing...

0:15:39.360,0:15:44.700
Even their professor in that country - they can do any job to live.

0:15:44.700,0:15:47.300
No right to leave the country.

0:15:47.300,0:15:58.600
No matter the grade, no matter your position in your country - you are ready to do any job just to cover up.

0:15:58.600,0:16:03.760
Once Jesus purchases you, you become aliens here on earth.

0:16:03.760,0:16:04.960
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:04.960,0:16:09.720
Once Jesus purchases you, you become aliens here on earth.

0:16:09.720,0:16:19.360
There is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.

0:16:19.360,0:16:21.420
What is the barrier?

0:16:21.420,0:16:24.800
You cannot go where Jesus will not be welcome.

0:16:24.800,0:16:30.680
There are many places the world goes you cannot go.

0:16:30.680,0:16:35.080
You must go where Jesus would be welcome.

0:16:35.080,0:16:40.660
In the world today, pretentious calm. In every circle.

0:16:40.660,0:16:47.560
A staff would enter the office to greet the chairman of the company, "Good morning, sir" -

0:16:47.560,0:16:51.640
but this is not such in heart.

0:16:51.640,0:17:01.340
After closing the door, they would do like this.

0:17:01.340,0:17:06.820
When they are doing this to the chairman of the company, "Good morning, sir",

0:17:06.820,0:17:12.260
the chairman would say, "Good morning".

0:17:12.260,0:17:16.500
He doesn't know they are deceiving him.

0:17:16.500,0:17:23.640
Many of you are working in a place where your superior, direct boss,

0:17:23.640,0:17:31.520
is someone who you know is below you - academically, in every area of life.

0:17:31.520,0:17:33.900
But what will you do?

0:17:33.900,0:17:40.260
You have to eat, and you keep greeting,

0:17:40.260,0:17:46.060
acting pretentiously as if you love him, but inside you, you are not happy.

0:17:46.060,0:17:53.040
But you need money, and you are a Christian - what kind of Christian is that?

0:17:53.040,0:18:03.560
There is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.

0:18:03.560,0:18:11.820
Once Jesus purchases us, we become aliens.

0:18:11.820,0:18:20.640
This world is not my home
I’m just passing through

0:18:20.640,0:18:29.260
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue

0:18:29.260,0:18:37.160
The angels beckon me 
From Heaven’s open door

0:18:37.160,0:18:46.260
And I can’t feel at home
In this world anymore

0:18:46.260,0:18:54.460
This world is not my home
I’m just passing through

0:18:54.460,0:19:02.800
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue

0:19:02.800,0:19:10.100
The angels beckon me 
From Heaven’s open door

0:19:10.100,0:19:22.160
And I can’t feel at home
In this world anymore

0:19:22.160,0:19:34.640
The reason why your confession and what you believe you have said in the past, have not been reflected:

0:19:34.640,0:19:41.900
you say, "Jesus. I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour",

0:19:41.900,0:19:46.140
but one thing we must know about acceptance -

0:19:46.140,0:19:55.500
before you can be accepted, commitment asks Jesus to accept you.

0:19:55.500,0:20:04.840
You say, "Lord Jesus, here I am. I'm a sinner. Wash me with your precious blood. Save my soul" -

0:20:04.840,0:20:19.040
you drop cigarettes, you stop going to night clubs, you stop to fight, you stop envy, jealousy.

0:20:19.040,0:20:29.700
It could be at that moment; not such in heart, but at that moment you drop everything.

0:20:29.700,0:20:40.760
Until your heart accepts what you are saying - you are such in heart then.

0:20:40.760,0:20:47.880
Commitment asks Jesus to accept you.

0:20:47.880,0:20:54.640
There are many things you have done and you claim you have done and are still doing

0:20:54.640,0:20:58.360
but you are not such in heart.

0:20:58.360,0:21:08.960
That is why if you drop cigarettes, "Lord Jesus, accept me. I will follow Jesus." - you stop cigarettes

0:21:08.960,0:21:12.780
but in your dream, you keep smoking cigarettes.

0:21:12.780,0:21:17.980
When you dream, they will give you cigarettes.

0:21:17.980,0:21:29.880
By the time you wake up, you will feel the odour in your mouth - you will know you smoked cigarettes.

0:21:29.880,0:21:34.480
"That is not for me" - but this keeps happening to you in the dream.

0:21:34.480,0:21:41.200
You stop drinking but you find yourself drinking in your dream.

0:21:41.200,0:21:44.760
You are a type that womanises; you have stopped it,

0:21:44.760,0:21:47.560
because you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Saviour

0:21:47.560,0:21:55.480
but in your dream - 20 women, 20 men, because you are not such in heart.

0:21:55.480,0:21:59.360
That is why these things will continue to reflect.

0:21:59.360,0:22:02.540
That is the word "commitment" we are talking about.

0:22:02.540,0:22:07.000
Commitment asks Jesus to accept you.

0:22:07.000,0:22:18.820
Commitment now stands as a bridge, a link, a go-between,

0:22:18.820,0:22:23.880
as an intermediary between us and Jesus.

0:22:23.880,0:22:34.280
Commitment means, mean it with all your heart.

0:22:34.280,0:22:43.140
The moment you make a commitment, you are going to be tested and tried on it,

0:22:43.140,0:22:46.580
to be sure that you really mean what you are saying.

0:22:46.580,0:22:56.280
Yes, faithfulness, "I'm faithful" - test will come to show if you are real, or you are faking yourself.

0:22:56.280,0:23:06.400
The moment you make a commitment, you are going to be tested and tried on it.

0:23:06.400,0:23:12.520
When you stand on your commitment throughout testing,

0:23:12.520,0:23:22.220
Jesus will give you more and more faith as you go along.

0:23:22.220,0:23:27.560
You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a commitment.

0:23:27.560,0:23:29.160
Tell your neighbour.

0:23:29.160,0:23:33.020
You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a commitment.

0:23:33.020,0:23:41.940
Faith is a pure gift from God.

0:23:41.940,0:23:50.480
You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a commitment.

0:23:50.480,0:23:56.760
Only faith pleases God.

0:23:56.760,0:23:58.400
Where are we going now?

0:23:58.400,0:24:06.760
At this point you should be able to know if you are a Christian, or you are about to be.

0:24:06.760,0:24:15.060
As a Christian, a believer, a pastor, a bishop, a prophet,

0:24:15.060,0:24:29.560
in every step, in every move, intimation must come -

0:24:29.560,0:24:41.540
a suggestion must come to us from the Spirit that the action be performed.

0:24:41.540,0:24:50.160
I'm facing you; you see me facing you - I must hear intimation,

0:24:50.160,0:25:02.200
"Move. Leave the place. Turn back."

0:25:02.200,0:25:08.840
There must be a corresponding power.

0:25:08.840,0:25:17.800
A suggestion must come to us from the Spirit.

0:25:17.800,0:25:22.060
That is why sometimes, when I behave here, you say, "What is wrong with this man?"

0:25:22.060,0:25:24.160
There is nothing wrong with me.

0:25:24.160,0:25:27.220
I am a servant.

0:25:27.220,0:25:40.180
I cannot dictate the kind of direction, the kind of position or what to say.

0:25:40.180,0:25:51.540
I cannot decide what suffering to bear.

0:25:51.540,0:25:58.580
I am a servant, an alien – a stranger here on earth.

0:25:58.580,0:26:02.940
You have to listen to your Master – Someone who is controlling you.

0:26:02.940,0:26:07.660
But today, you see the way you behave, the way you talk,

0:26:07.660,0:26:15.580
"Please, if you don't leave that place, I will show you".

0:26:15.580,0:26:19.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:19.820,0:26:25.480
You draw a time-table for the week - from now till next Friday;

0:26:25.480,0:26:31.600
what you want to do tomorrow, after tomorrow; you iron your different attire now -

0:26:31.600,0:26:38.340
I will wear this on Monday, I will wear this on Tuesday, Friday.

0:26:38.340,0:26:43.520
How do you know that you will live to see those days,

0:26:43.520,0:26:47.840
when you are an alien, a stranger, a servant?

0:26:47.840,0:26:51.020
How do you know you will live to wear all these dresses?

0:26:51.020,0:26:55.060
That is one of the big insults we often give to God.

0:26:55.060,0:27:03.140
Embarrassment - it is one of the biggest embarrassments to decide what you will do tomorrow,

0:27:03.140,0:27:05.080
after tomorrow.

0:27:05.080,0:27:07.180
What is the position of God?

0:27:07.180,0:27:10.160
We own now; God owns our future.

0:27:10.160,0:27:14.720
You take over today, He takes over our future.

0:27:14.720,0:27:20.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:20.400,0:27:29.920
Our lives have been like that because of knowledge of senses,

0:27:29.920,0:27:34.380
which is not creative.

0:27:34.380,0:27:39.480
The day you wake up and say, "Oh God; next - I don't know - over to you God" -

0:27:39.480,0:27:42.000
then you are a follower of Jesus.

0:27:42.000,0:27:44.840
The fear of God will be there.

0:27:44.840,0:27:47.580
Just wake up and say, "Ah!"

0:27:47.580,0:27:50.120
They call you.
- "Hello. Will you come and see me tomorrow?"

0:27:50.120,0:27:54.540
- "I don't know. I'm a servant of God."

0:27:54.540,0:28:01.920
- "Hello. The meeting is next Tuesday. What time are you leaving home?"

0:28:01.920,0:28:11.280
- "I'm sorry, I'm an alien, a stranger. I need to hear from above to know whether I will see tomorrow."

0:28:11.280,0:28:18.780
Then, you are a child of God, you begin to live great to represent God.

0:28:18.780,0:28:24.380
There are some lives we are supposed to prepare, to begin to live, to reset your future.

0:28:24.380,0:28:31.800
The whole thing is upside down.

0:28:31.800,0:28:41.020
You can start it now; leave your next for God - when I say next, I mean second.

0:28:41.020,0:28:47.420
Now, you can do whatever you want to do - it is over to you, because you give account to God.

0:28:47.420,0:28:51.960
You can do whatever you want to do; you can beat your brother - remember you will give account,

0:28:51.960,0:28:55.180
but next - next means future...

0:28:55.180,0:28:59.580
God owns our future; now is ours.

0:28:59.580,0:29:05.600
Now, the Lord can say to mamma here, "Please, come along with me".

0:29:05.600,0:29:09.300
You may say, "No", because He gives us discretion.

0:29:09.300,0:29:18.340
That is why He asked that man at the pool of Bethesda, "What can I do for you?"

0:29:18.340,0:29:20.060
"What can I do for you?"

0:29:20.060,0:29:22.140
He is supposed to say, "Please, rise and walk".

0:29:22.140,0:29:25.980
He said, "What can I do for you?", because He knows there is discretion.

0:29:25.980,0:29:30.780
The man could say, "Leave me. I don't need anything from you".

0:29:30.780,0:29:35.280
In the same way, as you are on the seat, the Lord can ask you, "Leave there",

0:29:35.280,0:29:36.620
you say, "No, I will not leave".

0:29:36.620,0:29:43.440
He is not going to do anything to you, He knows you will give account for your disobedience.

0:29:43.440,0:29:48.420
You will give account for your disobedience in the future.

0:29:48.420,0:29:54.680
Account is future; you will give account in the future, but now is yours.

0:29:54.680,0:30:00.260
You can start your life by leaving that future, next to God.

0:30:00.260,0:30:09.160
All those plans that you have already - it is an embarrassment.

0:30:09.160,0:30:11.620
Start that practice today.

0:30:11.620,0:30:14.680
Tell your neighbour, "I want to see you tomorrow".

0:30:14.680,0:30:23.260
And your neighbour should say, "Look, I'm a stranger, a servant - I need to consult my Boss".

0:30:23.260,0:30:25.980
And who is your Boss?

0:30:25.980,0:30:29.280
Tell your neighbour now.

0:30:29.280,0:30:36.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:36.800,0:30:48.240
- "I want to see you tomorrow."
- "I'm an alien, a servant."

0:30:48.240,0:30:52.180
Thank You, Jesus.
