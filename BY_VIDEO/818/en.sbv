0:00:00.000,0:00:02.520
Hallelujah!

0:00:02.520,0:00:05.920
Are you there?

0:00:05.920,0:00:11.680
I want to believe you have settled your account.

0:00:11.680,0:00:19.260
The principle in The SCOAN is what we believe in the Bible.

0:00:19.260,0:00:24.300
If you have not settled your account let us settle it now, it's not too late.

0:00:24.300,0:00:31.100
How many of you are still holding grudges, holding offence?

0:00:31.100,0:00:36.140
Whether right or wrong, you have no right to hold offence.

0:00:36.140,0:00:45.940
One thing we must know: an offence opens the door to satan.

0:00:45.940,0:00:47.240
Tell your neighbour.

0:00:47.240,0:00:50.860
[Offence opens the door to satan.]

0:00:50.860,0:00:56.240
Satan is looking for a way of getting you.

0:00:56.240,0:01:10.560
We Christians believe that, ... "I have stopped smoking, lying, going to night-clubs. Now I live a righteous life."

0:01:10.560,0:01:19.780
But you are still claiming your right, when someone accused you - you hold an offence against that person.

0:01:19.780,0:01:28.340
An offence opens the door to satan.

0:01:28.340,0:01:34.200
You keep saying, "What is the cause of my problem? I have not been smoking, and doing other things.

0:01:34.200,0:01:41.620
I have been living a righteous life. Why this setback? Why this trouble? Why nightmare? Why sickness?"

0:01:41.620,0:01:47.760
An offence opens the door to demons.

0:01:47.760,0:01:50.920
You know what satan brings when he comes to your life;

0:01:50.920,0:02:08.380
he brings affliction, depression, poverty, hardship, crisis, all what you are facing now - the situation you are in.

0:02:08.380,0:02:15.240
An offence opens the door to satan.

0:02:15.240,0:02:16.280
Tell your neighbour again.

0:02:16.280,0:02:19.040
[An offence opens the door to satan.]

0:02:19.040,0:02:20.060
Again.

0:02:20.060,0:02:23.160
[An offence opens the door to satan.]

0:02:23.160,0:02:30.880
When you hold offence, whether you are right or wrong;

0:02:30.880,0:02:41.620
when you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit

0:02:41.620,0:02:49.460
because you are not allowed to hold an offence, whether you are wrong or right.

0:02:49.460,0:02:53.500
You know, we Christians are always right - that is our principle.

0:02:53.500,0:02:57.260
We are right while others are wrong.

0:02:57.260,0:03:09.020
You lie against me, and you hold an offence against him; you are grieving the Holy Spirit.

0:03:09.020,0:03:13.540
Then, you allow satan.

0:03:13.540,0:03:15.360
Are you with me?

0:03:15.360,0:03:23.380
Viewers all over the world, wherever you are; whatever position you are in – listen to me.

0:03:23.380,0:03:32.940
An offence opens the door to satan and you know what satan brings when he comes -

0:03:32.940,0:03:38.280
disease, situation, depression – just name all those foolish  things

0:03:38.280,0:03:41.660
that is the work of satan; he is synonymous with these.

0:03:41.660,0:03:49.080
When you talk of sickness, satan is synonymous – he gives birth to them.

0:03:49.080,0:03:55.160
An offence opens the door.

0:03:55.160,0:04:02.680
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence.

0:04:02.680,0:04:12.660
When you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved God Himself.

0:04:12.660,0:04:21.400
You have to be free; when your spirit is free, it can contact the Spirit of God.

0:04:21.400,0:04:27.120
A free spirit contacts the Spirit of God – is sensitive to the Spirit of God.

0:04:27.120,0:04:33.100
It is time now, before we begin to pray, it is time for you and me...

0:04:33.100,0:04:36.900
This is why I'm asking you, "Have you settled your account?"

0:04:36.900,0:04:43.520
This is what the Bible means by forgive me as I have forgiven those who what?

0:04:43.520,0:04:47.340
Forgive me as I have what?

0:04:47.340,0:04:50.360
This is what the Bible is talking about.

0:04:50.360,0:04:53.900
Forgive me as I have forgiven those who sin against me.

0:04:53.900,0:04:55.260
Have you?

0:04:55.260,0:05:02.820
You have to forgive; if you forgive, you hold no offence – you let offence go.

0:05:02.820,0:05:07.020
Right now, open your lips and begin to "fire-on".

0:05:07.020,0:05:10.420
Remember, you need restitution.

0:05:10.420,0:05:13.180
When you leave here just make a call.

0:05:13.180,0:05:16.160
A phone call can settle many of your cases.

0:05:16.160,0:05:18.280
Right now, prayer.

0:05:18.280,0:05:20.560
Ask God to give you the grace.

0:05:20.560,0:05:24.540
Give me enablement Lord, to forgive those who have wronged me.

0:05:24.540,0:05:29.120
Lord Jesus, give me enablement.

0:05:29.120,0:05:35.500
Real love forgets wrongs so that there will be hope for the future.

0:05:35.500,0:05:44.500
The reason why you have to forget and love is that a servant today can be a leader tomorrow.

0:05:44.500,0:05:50.400
Someone you call a murderer today, your enemy today, can be your saviour tomorrow.

0:05:50.400,0:05:58.820
Your greatest enemy can be your saviour tomorrow or the saviour of your children.

0:05:58.820,0:06:04.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:04.420,0:06:10.040
Tomorrow is a mystery.

0:06:10.040,0:06:13.920
Since tomorrow is a mystery, we don't know what will happen next,

0:06:13.920,0:06:20.920
we have to be very careful today so that we will not annoy, offend tomorrow.

0:06:20.920,0:06:23.820
Tell your neighbour, "Tomorrow is a mystery."

0:06:23.820,0:06:25.100
[Tomorrow is a mystery.]

0:06:25.100,0:06:27.540
Since I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,

0:06:27.540,0:06:29.200
[Since I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,]

0:06:29.200,0:06:31.580
I don’t want to offend tomorrow.

0:06:31.580,0:06:33.620
[I don’t want to offend tomorrow.]

0:06:33.620,0:06:36.640
You can offend tomorrow by today.

0:06:36.640,0:06:44.340
What you are doing today can offend tomorrow; what you are doing today can give favour tomorrow.

0:06:44.340,0:06:49.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:49.180,0:06:58.340
Yes, you cannot just explain tomorrow because God is tomorrow and the future.

0:06:58.340,0:07:05.440
Since you don’t know tomorrow, today you have to be very careful.

0:07:05.440,0:07:08.540
Be very very careful.

0:07:08.540,0:07:12.320
God does as He wills.

0:07:12.320,0:07:22.720
He can take what is unlikely to the palace and undeserved one would be there.

0:07:22.720,0:07:24.940
He does as He wills.

0:07:24.940,0:07:27.180
Let us be very very careful.

0:07:27.180,0:07:34.240
This is why you shouldn't judge your children by their character now.

0:07:34.240,0:07:43.380
The worst of your children can be the king tomorrow, the saviour of the family tomorrow.

0:07:43.380,0:07:50.400
Don't judge them be their attitude or character; continue to press on to changed them.

0:07:50.400,0:07:56.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:56.400,0:08:04.000
I want to speak to every challenge.

0:08:04.000,0:08:09.240
We know satan is behind your challenges.

0:08:09.240,0:08:13.260
Satan is the cause of challenges.

0:08:13.260,0:08:23.940
Satan is responsible for whatever challenges you have because satan is synonymous with challenges.

0:08:23.940,0:08:33.080
I speak to every challenge in your life and I command them to leave, in Jesus' name.

0:08:33.080,0:08:43.280
You demon, I speak to you wherever you are in their lives -

0:08:43.280,0:08:46.340
be it their career,

0:08:46.340,0:08:49.040
be it their destiny,

0:08:49.040,0:08:51.540
be it their finances,

0:08:51.540,0:08:54.920
be it their business – out, in Jesus' name.

0:08:54.920,0:09:02.220
I speak to you demon, I command you to leave them, in the name of Jesus.

0:09:02.220,0:09:08.260
Say, "Demon, leave me, in the name of Jesus."

0:09:08.260,0:09:16.540
Remember, every knee shall bow.

0:09:16.540,0:09:20.940
"Knees" means, demons must bow.

0:09:20.940,0:09:26.220
Every tongue shall confess Jesus.

0:09:26.220,0:09:29.680
Demons must listen to the voice of God.

0:09:29.680,0:09:37.540
I say to you, you demon – out, in Jesus' name!

0:09:37.540,0:09:41.080
You satan – out, in Jesus' name!

0:09:41.080,0:09:44.360
Command them out, in Jesus' name.

You demon, come out, in Jesus' name!

0:11:03.620,0:11:13.880
I command that devil, that will that is not of God, the will that is not of Jesus - I say to that will:

0:11:13.880,0:11:16.360
let the will of God be done!

0:11:16.360,0:11:22.780
