1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Good Morning, Church!

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,060
I am Doctor Sunday Simon.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,520
I am an orthopaedic technologist specialising in fabricating prosthetics and orthoses

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,100
that is known as artificial legs and artificial hands.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,620
I formerly worked with Leprosy Mission International, based in Niger State (Nigeria).

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,440
I am originally from Benue State (Nigeria).

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,740
The people standing behind me are my family.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:40,380
This is my wife, my first daughter, my son, my daughter, my daughter and the other one.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,760
They are seven; the two kids are my grandchildren.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:54,800
My first training was in Tanzania; that was vocational training with a vocational job.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,420
I went to school in Ethiopia also.

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,000
The one I did in Tanzania was a diploma course.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,680
The NGO employed me as an orthopaedic technologist.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,720
I was the one making artificial limbs for people who had undergone amputations,

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,500
hands, upper limbs and lower limbs – that is hands and legs.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,900
In 2013, the NGO said they could not continue any longer and we were retrenched.

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:35,580
After I was retrenched, I started going around looking for clients

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,300
so I could make artificial limbs for them to make money and take care of my family.

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,420
I travelled all the way to Abuja to the National Orthopaedic Hospital and did operations there.

20
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,660
I travelled to other local governments in Niger State (Nigeria) and other states.

21
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,980
There were three clients I collected money from -

22
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:06,960
one was below the knee amputation and two were ‘ak’; with ‘ak’, I charged N300,000.

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Below the knee is N250,000.

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,300
I used to collect advances to enable me to buy the chemicals

25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,320
and other materials needed to make the artificial limb for them.

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,960
I collected and on my way to Jos to buy there and in Kano,

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,700
because I used to get my materials in Jos and Kano,

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,040
on my way, after the rain, we were going down.

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,500
I was involved in an accident in my own car.

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,400
The only thing I knew is that I found myself in hospital.

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:50,280
I was told by the nurse behind me that I was in the General Hospital in Jos.

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,360
When I asked what happened, she said I had been in an accident and my leg had been amputated.

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,140
I started crying and she said I should not cry, that they had saved my life.

34
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,860
I, who used to fabricate for other people had now become a victim.

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,280
I don’t know what was really wrong with me.

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,360
The chief medical officer in charge of that hospital said I should not worry.

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,580
I said, "OK".

38
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,300
I spent 21 days in the hospital.

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,840
After they calculated everything, the surgery and the drugs,

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,440
it amounted to N250,000 because the medical officer in charge of that hospital knew me.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,100
He said he was aware of my situation, that I should go without paying anything.

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,680
He said he would take care of everything with the hospital authorities.

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,740
I said, "OK".

44
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,460
Upon getting home on the third day,

45
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:47,520
the people I had collected the money from came back and said they needed the artificial leg,

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,620
either the artificial leg or the money.

47
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,520
I said, “I’m just coming from the hospital.

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,800
How can I use these crutches and make an artificial leg for you? Give me time.”

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,400
They said there was no more time they could give me, that I should pay.

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,460
I said, “OK, let me think over it”.

51
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,460
A week later, I was about to eat.

52
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,980
They put food for me on my table and I was about to eat.

53
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,080
I saw the man with a policeman.

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,540
They said they wanted to see me at the police station.

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,680
I asked, "Now?"

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,740
They said, "Yes".

57
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,200
I asked if they could wait so I could eat.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,040
They said no, that it was a long journey and they couldn’t wait for me to eat

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,980
because at that time, armed robbers used to terrorize people on the road.

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,960
I said, “OK,” and asked them to get one of my shirts.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,300
I put on my shirt and started carrying my crutches.

62
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,400
I started following them.

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,320
When we got there, they said, “You are a crook!”

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
“You collected money from somebody and you cannot pay them.”

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,300
The police started saying things to me.

66
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,940
I said, “OK, because I didn’t fabricate the leg for the man, there is nothing I can say.

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,040
You will say whatever you want”.

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,280
Then they locked me inside.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,160
My wife started crying at home and contacted my friends.

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,320
They gave me one month to either pay them the money or make the artificial limb for them.

71
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,660
I told them that it was not easy for me.

72
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,960
Secondly, the landlord gave me a quit notice, he gave me one month to pack out from the house.

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,520
I said, "OK".

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
So, my children had to stop school.

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,120
The one who is playing football is supposed to be outside the country by now;

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,960
the friends he was playing with have gone.

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,000
He cannot meet up with the financial demand.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,020
One of my daughters there who is pregnant – it was when the trouble was too much for my wife

79
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,280
and she brought her here that I realised she was pregnant.

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,700
When the pressure became too much for me, I decided I would not stay any longer,

81
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,540
receiving this embarrassment, that I would come to Lagos where people didn’t know me.

82
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,280
However, in northern states, I am well known.

83
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,860
When I came to Lagos, I walked inside the town

84
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,580
and saw all these Hausa people sitting down, begging.

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,860
I considered what I would be able to do with just one leg and crutches.

86
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,100
I didn’t know what to do.
I just sat down with them.

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,500
I understood the Hausa people very well.
I can speak Hausa.

88
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,340
I spent almost 15 years in Hausa land.
I would stay there with them.

89
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,880
Whenever they brought money or gifts, they would share them, one by one.

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,680
I would stay among them and collect money.

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,360
Sometimes, they would bring food.
The clothes I am wearing was a gift from them.

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,300
If you saw the way I dressed, you would think that I was a worker.

93
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:49,800
There were only two items of clothing – jeans and trousers that I came with from Niger

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,920
but I have different types of shirts that were given to me.

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,200
You mean to say, sir, that you actually had to run away from where you were living in Niger State

96
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,460
to run down to Lagos, because everyone knew you as a medical doctor in Niger State,

97
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,420
and because of the embarrassment of what you were facing people were running after you,

98
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,240
trying to collect the money, that you had taken from them to produce artificial legs.

99
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,460
You actually escaped to Lagos and started to beg, is that right?

100
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,580
Yes; that is what I said.

101
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,660
Around Niger State, people know me but in Lagos State, I can say nobody knows me here.

102
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,420
I can do any type of job here.
That’s why I ran to Lagos.

103
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,980
I wanted to look for a way to help my family.

104
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,520
I could not sit down and watch the way my children would be crying for food.

105
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,120
People would drive us away and call police on us.

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,700
That is why I came down here.

107
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,920
When I get this little money, it just helps me to pay for accommodation

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,400
because since last year May that I came here, I’ve been staying in a lodging.

109
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,740
If I don’t pay, they will drive me out.

110
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,300
All the money I am collecting, I will pay for the lodging.

111
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,200
I will eat from it.
Sometimes, I will not eat anything.

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,900
Things continued like that.

113
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:12,740
Then, one day, a woman came and asked me the problem I had.

114
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,320
I shared my problem briefly with her and she asked me if I had heard about The SCOAN.

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:28,140
I told her yes and that Hausa people know of it, that they used to bring gifts for them.

116
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,440
I didn’t know that the woman was video recording me.

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:43,960
An hour later, she showed me the video of how I sat in the midst of those people.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,480
I saw all these Hausa people running.
I asked what was happening.

119
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,680
Before I could look, all these government agencies called Kick Against Indiscipline came

120
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,260
and started beating me on my back.

121
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,520
Before I could put the stump of my leg into the prosthesis, they had started beating me.

122
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,880
I nearly fell onto the main road and escaped a motor crushing me.

123
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:18,480
After I was flogged by those people, I made up my mind that if God be on my side, I would come here.

124
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,860
OK.

125
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,480
So, we've heard it from our father here; this is the situation that brought him to The SCOAN.

126
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,120
We want to hear a quick word from his wife.

127
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,700
Madam, you are very welcome.

128
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Can you also introduce yourself to us and tell us what you can say concerning

129
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,260
what your husband has been saying right now?

130
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,620
People of God; Good Morning, everybody.

131
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,840
My name is Faith Simon.

132
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,900
This man by me is my husband.

133
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,560
It happened as my husband has said.

134
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,180
My husband left us.

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,160
The police started disturbing us.

136
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,460
Our house rent has expired.

137
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,660
The landlord is disturbing us.

138
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,520
People of God, help me!
Man of God, help me! I have suffered!

139
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:21,940
When I leave here, I don’t have anywhere to go.

140
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,140
I have suffered.

141
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,440
No food, nothing – no help from anywhere.

142
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,700
I think we have heard from our mother; we can see the emotions because of what she has passed through.

143
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,540
We can understand that she was left alone with her children, when her husband was forced to leave.

144
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,520
My name is Janet Simon.

145
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,200
I am 11 years old.

146
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,100
The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was that of poverty.

147
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,680
We have suffered a lot.

148
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,420
Right now, I am not even going to school anymore.

149
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,960
My dad is no longer working.

150
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,940
He has been begging in Lagos for long.

151
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,660
My mum – it was just a little business that we have been doing.

152
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,420
It is only garri (cassava product) that we drink.

153
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,800
Man of God, please, help us.

154
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
My family and I have suffered.

155
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,400
I am not even going to school anymore. My mates are going to school; I would be seeing them.

156
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,180
Man of God, please, help my family!

157
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,160
We have suffered a lot!

158
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,120
We have suffered.

159
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,340
Please, Man of God, help us!

160
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,600
OK. So, we have listened to the little girl; she is only 11 years old

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,080
but because of the situation she is out of school and she is actually forced to join her mother on the streets,

162
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,020
selling small items just to try to fend for herself.

163
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,760
At this point, we want to ask our father.

164
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,920
Here, we can see a few documents on the board beside him.

165
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,520
Can you just explain to us what we are seeing on these documents here,

166
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,360
to back up the experience you are sharing.

167
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,960
This is my certificate from Tanzania.

168
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,640
As an Orthopaedic Technologist, I have a diploma in orthopaedic technology.

169
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,060
This is my certificate as an Orthopaedic Technologist,

170
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,160
specialising in orthoses and prostheses – both upper and lower limbs.

171
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:24,480
This is my work, this is my certificate that I finished my school in Tanzania.

172
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,660
This is me, the time I was in school.

173
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,520
This one is from Sudan.

174
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,480
This is me - Nigeria.

175
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,980
This one is from Sudan also.

176
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,020
All of them are my friends, my colleagues.

177
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,840
This is me, here.

178
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,380
This is my profession.

179
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,600
This is the type of prosthesis.

180
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,300
You can see it.

181
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,060
This is the type of prosthesis.

182
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,500
This is a sample I made for a lady coming from Akwa Ibom.

183
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,940
So, once again, people of God; we have heard it from this family.

184
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,800
As we mentioned earlier, as people of God, we can't afford to look the other way,

185
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,080
when we see our brothers in trouble.

186
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,880
Prophet T.B. Joshua says that your rewards in life are determined

187
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,520
by the problems you solve for someone else.

188
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,200
We have listened to the experience of this family.

189
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,620
We are here today to give a message from our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

190
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:41,720
He said that right now, for your immediate needs, to establish yourself -

191
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,540
we are here right now, on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide

192
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,160
to give this family the sum of N500,000.

193
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,740
T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation

194
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:03,220
In addition to this, Prophet T.B. Joshua said that the children who are out of school will be given scholarships

195
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,980
to return to their education.

196
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,200
T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation

197
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,640
In addition to that, the accommodation problem that they talked about will also be sorted out

198
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,180
and accommodation will be provided for this family,

199
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,080
so that all the family can be together as one

200
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,560
and the different children that are scattered to different places because of this problem

201
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,660
can come together as one.

202
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,200
This is a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua for this family, to let them know

203
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,480
that there is hope in Christ Jesus.

204
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,520
This is the sum of N500,000 for their immediate needs,

205
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,500
a scholarship for the children who had been taken out of school,

206
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,800
and in addition to that, accommodation will be provided for this family,

207
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,260
by the ministry and Emmanuel TV partners worldwide.

208

T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation

209
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,480
The children that have been mentioned - here we can see them overcome by emotions.

210
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,060
The children who were out of school will be taken in under the scholarship program,

211
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,080
here at The SCOAN, to the glory of God Almighty.

212

T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation

213
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,260
Man of God, I thank you very much.

214
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:27,840
People of God, Emmanuel TV, The SCOAN team, everybody, all the members - I thank you.

215
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,100
God will double it for you people.

216
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,680
And this church will be the "highest" church in the whole world.

217
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,500
Yes, because this is where anybody can run to and be saved, both spiritually and financially.

218
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,900
I thank God for what the man of God has done for my family.

219
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,780
I thank God.

220
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,460
God bless you - you and your family.

221
00:15:52,460 --> 00:16:06,160
T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation

222
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,380
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

223
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,240
Thank You, Jesus!

224
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,660
I thank you very much.

225
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,940
Words cannot express my joy.

226
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,060
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

227
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:35,600
As our brother said earlier, the joy is so much that this family did not even have natural words to express it,

228
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,520
except to say, "Thank You, Jesus Christ."

229
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,980
We wouldn't want to go much farther.

230
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,420
We know that they are still overcome by the emotions and joy of what has just happened to them.

231
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,500
But we want to remind and stress to our viewers all over the world that we are showing you this,

232
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,340
and presenting this publicly as an encouragement to people all over the world.

233
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,360
There are many people who have similar challenges, similar conditions to this family,

234
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,300
who are in your neighbourhood, in your environment, your locality

235
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,280
and we believe that God has given to you something that is capable of changing their lives.

236
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Let this be an inspiration to you.

237
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,860
How many people are you capable of changing, and how many people have you changed?

238
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,980
This is actually what matters to Jesus Christ, more than church attendance, giving offerings in the church,

239
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,780
more than just praising or worshipping God on Sundays and fasting and praying;

240
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,220
"How many people's lives have you changed?"

241
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,840
Let this inspire you to build your life around your contributions to others

242
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,980
and definitely your own success and happiness depend on your willingness to help others solve their problems.

243
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,660
We thank God for what God has done in the life of this family.

244
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,440
We know that the best is yet to come and they're going to come back with more wonderful testimonies,

245
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,700
as a result of this blessing that they received here.

246
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,300
This is just a seed, that will be planted to produce a multiple harvest in their lives,

247
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,060
and we know that the best is yet to come.

248
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,600
One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

249
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,360
STANDARD FOR LIFE

250
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,220
After sharing his pathetic experience with the people of God,

251
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,080
Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners promised to help Doctor Sunday and his family.

252
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,880
The promise given to me by Prophet T.B. Joshua:

253
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:35,440
When I came here last week, he blessed me with some money – N500,000 – that I should use it

254
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,080
to  help settle some of my problems and he also promised me accommodation.

255
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,800
He said I should go round, find accommodation and he would pay for me

256
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,880
so that I could settle down with my family in peace.

257
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,020
I have gone round and found an accommodation.

258
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,680
That is why I came here this evening.

259
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,600
How much does your accommodation cost?

260
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,300
My accommodation for two years is N450,000.

261
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:12,320
We are here to present to you the total sum of N450,000 cash, so you can take care of your accommodation.

262
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,160
Thank You, Jesus!

263
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,660
You have saved us!

264
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,540
All our problems are over.

265
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,700
Our past is over!

266
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,420
Thank You, Jesus!

267
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,680
Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners give Doctor Sunday and his family

268
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:38,020
a sum of N450,000 for his accommodation and also for the upkeep of himself and his family.

269
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:54,500
Dr Sunday Simon & Family Sing Songs Of Praise And Thanksgiving To God

270
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,000
Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners promised to give Doctor Sunday's children

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,420
scholarship to further their education.

272
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,580
Tell us your name.

273
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,440
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

274
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,260
My name is Alexander Simon.

275
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,220
I am from Niger State, Nigeria.

276
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:20,160
We are the ones whom the man of God provided accommodation for.

277
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,280
He blessed my father with N500,000 to start his business.

278
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,040
Now, he has started the business – to God be the glory!

279
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,520
He also promised us scholarships and that is why we are here today.

280
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,920
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

281
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,000
My name is Janet Simon.

282
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,260
I came here with my dad, Mr Sunday Simon, with my mother, and my siblings.

283
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,240
We came here, my dad was sacked from his work.

284
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,540
It was very difficult for us.

285
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,600
We came here hoping for help from the man of God and he helped us,

286
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,840
gave us accommodation and the sum of N500,000 to start our business.

287
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,300
Right now, we are here to thank God for the man of God who has made it possible for us

288
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,640
to continue our schooling, in Jesus’ name.

289
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,480
I had stopped going to school.

290
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,480
What my friends were learning, I was not with them and they left me behind.

291
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,100
I missed some classes – some subjects; I was not there.

292
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,980
I missed a lot.

293
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,340
My knowledge was going down because I was not in school.

294
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,560
Right now, I want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners

295
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,940
for what they have done for my life and for the promise he has made for me and my family.

296
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,460
I pray God will bless him, in Jesus’ name.

297
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,180
Amen.

298
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,860
I stopped school in SS3 and I was not able to complete my secondary school education.

299
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,900
My mates paid for the WAEC and NECO exams.

300
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,560
What even baffled me the most was that it was a government school

301
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,720
but I was not able to raise the amount for the WAEC; so, I stopped secondary school

302
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,640
but now, I want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners

303
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
for the promise he made to us for a scholarship.

304
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,740
Not only did Prophet T.B. Joshua provide accommodation for the family,

305
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,660
he also promised to give Doctor Sunday's children scholarship to go back to school again,

306
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,920
in order to achieve their dreams and aspirations in life.

307
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:26,780
Here is the sum of N140,000 presented to Doctor Sunday and his children.

308
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,300
Glory be to God and I thank the man of God.

309
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:38,500
I want to thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and Emmanuel TV partners

310
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,240
for the money that my children requested for their schooling has been given to them.

311
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,860
They requested for a total sum of N126,500

312
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,200
and the man of God increased the money to N140,000 which I am having now.

313
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:01,860
God will bless him, The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV partners

314
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,880
and the staff of The SCOAN.

315
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,480
Now, I am happy and all my family, including my children, are happy.

316
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,080
They can go back to school now.

317
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,700
I pray that everything will be a success, that they will not disappoint the man of God,

318
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,160
in Jesus' name.

319
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,440
Amen. Thank you very much.

320
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,780
We would like to hear from our brother and sister.

321
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,220
I want to thank the man of God for what he has done for us.

322
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,960
I am very exited that I am going back to school.

323
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,780
I want to thank the Emmanuel TV partners for what they have done

324
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,540
because they have done a lot for us.

325
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,760
I want to thank them.

326
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,500
May God bless them, in Jesus’ name.

327
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,400
I promise the man of God that I will not fail him; I will face my studies

328
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,940
and make it throughout secondary school.

329
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,820
Thank you.

330
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,940
So, let's hear from our sister. 

331
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,180
I want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners

332
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,380
for what they have done in my life and that of my family.

333
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,660
I want to appreciate him.

334
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,820
I pray that God will multiply him, in Jesus name.

335
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,080
I promise to do well in my education and come out with flying colours, in Jesus’ name.

336
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,020
I pray that he prays for me and strengthens me in His way, in Jesus’ name.

337
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,180
Thank you very much.

338
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,940
We also thank God for your life, for this wonderful grace you have received.

339
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,480
We want to encourage you to stay true to our Lord, Jesus Christ.

340
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,680
Remember, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners are doing this for your future,

341
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,000
so that you may come out as a good and successful citizen,

342
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,900
to be useful to yourself, your family and your society.

343
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,140
This is because the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners see their contribution to your life

344
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,680
as an assignment from God. 

345
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,840
Just like you have promised, make sure you face your studies and be serious in school.

346
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,520
We believe that your coming out will indeed be in flying colours, in Jesus' name.

347
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,020
Amen!

348
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,400
Thank You, Jesus!

349
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,900
