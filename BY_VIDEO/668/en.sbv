0:00:00.000,0:00:01.960
You are homeless.

0:00:01.960,0:00:03.220
That is, there is no house.

0:00:03.220,0:00:03.820
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:03.820,0:00:06.880
You paid money somewhere and
 they refused to give you receipt.

0:00:06.880,0:00:07.840
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:07.840,0:00:10.020
Okay, don't worry. What happened to your former house?

0:00:10.020,0:00:11.780
It was burned by neighbours.

0:00:11.780,0:00:17.440
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:17.440,0:00:22.620
My name is Josephine Iweke.

0:00:22.620,0:00:32.060
I am from Imo State, residing in Abuja.

0:00:32.060,0:00:37.280
I am a teacher, teaching at a junior 
secondary school.

0:00:37.280,0:00:41.320
I was in the first service when the man
of God came to me and said,

0:00:41.320,0:00:46.660
"Sister, you are homeless. What 
happened to your former house?"

0:00:46.660,0:00:51.120
I got up and said, "It's true, Man of 
God. It was burnt by neighbours".

0:00:51.120,0:00:56.480
After they burned it, the people that I am working with in the educational department

0:00:56.480,0:01:00.120
said that my life was not safe in that village.

0:01:00.120,0:01:07.080
So they transferred me to a town where I began to work in the school there.

0:01:07.080,0:01:13.200
The cost of living inside town was very difficult for me, with what I was passing through.

0:01:13.200,0:01:17.600
I asked my principal if she could get me a place to sleep at.

0:01:17.600,0:01:23.080
She said she did not have but asked if I could manage to sleep in the classroom after school.

0:01:23.080,0:01:25.500
I told her that I could manage.

0:01:25.500,0:01:31.080
After school, I would bring out my things where I had hidden them,

0:01:31.080,0:01:36.780
sweep the floor and sleep on a mat somebody had given me.

0:01:36.780,0:01:40.100
I would sleep on a mat next to the security man.

0:01:40.100,0:01:45.760
First thing in the morning, I would fetch water from the borehole, bathe and dress up.

0:01:45.760,0:01:50.360
Other teachers thought that I used to come to school very early.

0:01:50.360,0:01:52.360
I used to be punctual.

0:01:52.360,0:01:55.100
They were seeing me but didn't even know what had happened.

0:01:55.100,0:01:59.360
My principal was shedding tears. She said that she didn't want anybody to know

0:01:59.360,0:02:02.980
that I was staying there as a female teacher, for my safety.

0:02:02.980,0:02:10.260
That is how I became homeless in Abuja, up till now.

0:02:10.260,0:02:16.840
When we closed for this vacation, I went home to see my parents.

0:02:16.840,0:02:21.800
My mother then started crying because the case was in court.

0:02:21.800,0:02:27.700
The commissioner of police took the case to court against the person they had caught.

0:02:27.700,0:02:30.780
Then I came here with my parents.

0:02:30.780,0:02:35.580
The man of God prophesied to me that I was homeless. Up till now, I am homeless.

0:02:35.580,0:02:41.480
Everything in my bedroom got burnt. I had two rooms.

0:02:41.480,0:02:45.880
The other room had a plastic chair and a small television.

0:02:45.880,0:02:48.520
So, everything I had was burnt down.

0:02:48.520,0:02:54.220
When we resumed, I would go home and continue sleeping in the school.

0:02:54.220,0:02:57.700
Just tell us, for how long have you been in this condition?

0:02:57.700,0:03:04.840
Since January 30th when this thing happened, I have been sleeping in the classroom

0:03:04.840,0:03:09.940
because immediately the Education Department that I am working with

0:03:09.940,0:03:14.960
transferred me and intervened with the help of human rights activists

0:03:14.960,0:03:18.900
to whom the case was reported to.

0:03:18.900,0:03:22.120
I have been homeless. People have been assisting me.

0:03:22.120,0:03:25.740
We have heard from Mrs Josephine Iweke explain

0:03:25.740,0:03:29.800
how her house and possessions were burnt and as a result of this,

0:03:29.800,0:03:36.780
she had no other option but to sleep on the floor of the school in which she teaches.

0:03:36.780,0:03:45.320
Prophet T. B. Joshua gives Mrs Josephine Iweke a cash sum of 1 million naira to rebuild herself.

0:03:45.320,0:03:52.560
In addition to the 1 million naira, she is also presented with three bags of rice.

0:03:52.560,0:03:56.920
Thank You, Lord. Thank You, my God.

0:03:56.920,0:04:00.240
The Lord of Synagogue, the Lord of Prophet T. B. Joshua,

0:04:00.240,0:04:03.040
the Lord that created all of us, thank You!

0:04:03.060,0:04:08.280
Actually, teachers are the step that brought everybody to where you are.

0:04:08.280,0:04:10.300
Thank You, Lord, for seeing me through.

0:04:10.300,0:04:16.440
We have many good samaritans in our midst who feel what others are feeling

0:04:16.440,0:04:19.820
We have listened to the plight of this woman.

0:04:19.820,0:04:27.080
In addition to this cash gift of 1 million naira from the anointed man of God and three bag of rice,

0:04:27.080,0:04:30.080
we want to call on the good samaritans in our midst

0:04:30.080,0:04:35.120
as the Spirit of God has touched your heart, to also make a contribution to this woman.

0:04:35.120,0:04:40.200
Please, can you step forward and also give your contribution to this woman.

0:04:40.200,0:04:43.040
She deserves our help.

0:04:43.040,0:04:47.540
Deeply touched by what Prophet T. B. Joshua had done for this woman,

0:04:47.540,0:04:53.460
many people from the congregation came out to help in their own way.

0:04:53.460,0:05:00.760
Remember, a time to give is not a time to show off but a time to reshape our destiny.

0:05:00.760,0:05:06.560
I am adding the sum of N100,000 to 
what the man of God has given her.

0:05:06.560,0:05:10.560
My name is Bodis from Bayelsa State.

0:05:10.560,0:05:14.960
On behalf of my wife, my son and my daughter, I am giving her N500,000.

0:05:14.960,0:05:18.500
Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!

0:05:18.500,0:05:22.100
My name is Mr Emmanuel Nmankwo from Abuja, Nigeria.

0:05:22.100,0:05:25.740
I am supporting the man of God with N100,000.

0:05:25.740,0:05:27.680
Thank you very much.

0:05:27.680,0:05:30.360
My name is Mr Pascal Odiegwu.

0:05:30.360,0:05:37.820
On behalf of my family, I am supporting the man of God with N200,000.

0:05:37.820,0:05:43.420
When we give, we create for ourselves a purse that does not grow old.

0:05:43.420,0:05:46.160
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:05:46.160,0:05:49.940
My name is Josephine Iweke.

0:05:49.940,0:05:54.840
I am from Imo State, residing in Abuja.

0:05:54.840,0:06:01.540
I am very happy and grateful for what 
God has used Prophet T. B. Joshua

0:06:01.540,0:06:05.940
and Emmanuel TV partners all 
over the world to do in my life.

0:06:05.940,0:06:10.600
Honestly, they have reformed my 
life, they have changed my life

0:06:10.600,0:06:16.500
to another level because I 
was homeless before.

0:06:16.500,0:06:19.840
I had nowhere to sleep, nowhere to lay my head.

0:06:19.840,0:06:28.380
I came to The SCOAN hoping to be prayed for and be delivered, out of this problem.

0:06:28.380,0:06:32.420
On Sunday, the first week of September, I was here.

0:06:32.420,0:06:36.500
The man of God came to me and prophesied that I was homeless.

0:06:36.500,0:06:40.180
He asked me what had happened to my former house.

0:06:40.180,0:06:45.040
I was shocked because the prophecy was very correct.

0:06:45.040,0:06:46.660
100% correct.

0:06:46.660,0:06:48.660
You are homeless.

0:06:48.660,0:06:49.820
That is, there is no house.

0:06:49.820,0:06:50.560
Yes, Man of God.

0:06:50.560,0:06:53.520
And you paid money somewhere and they refused to give you a receipt.

0:06:53.520,0:06:54.760
Yes, Man of God.

0:06:54.760,0:06:56.760
Okay, don't worry. What happened to your former house?

0:06:56.760,0:06:59.080
It was burned by neighbours.

0:06:59.080,0:07:01.840
It was as if he had entered my mind to because that was what brought me here.

0:07:01.840,0:07:05.720
I was homeless because they burnt my house.

0:07:05.720,0:07:09.540
I had been roaming about with nowhere to stay, sleeping in a classroom

0:07:09.540,0:07:12.660
where I was reposted as a teacher.

0:07:12.660,0:07:15.800
The prophecy is very correct.

0:07:15.800,0:07:19.600
I was afraid but the day that I received the prophecy,

0:07:19.600,0:07:22.660
I was relieved that my problem was solved.

0:07:22.660,0:07:27.420
I was happy, jumping that my problem had been solved.

0:07:27.420,0:07:43.720
To my greatest surprise, the man of God gave me the sum of 1 million naira, three bags of rice

0:07:43.720,0:07:46.600
and a copy of 'The Mirror'.

0:07:46.600,0:07:50.960
I was shocked because I never expected this.

0:07:50.960,0:07:55.180
I was glorifying God for my prophecy, that my problem was solved.

0:07:55.180,0:07:58.320
I didn't know he would follow it up to this extent.

0:07:58.320,0:08:01.040
The follow-up was a surprise to me.

0:08:01.040,0:08:06.320
I was shocked and happy.
I didn't expect that.

0:08:06.320,0:08:09.500
My mind is like that of a new-born baby.

0:08:09.500,0:08:13.200
After that, he also told the
Emmanuel TV Partners to assist.

0:08:13.200,0:08:19.480
and a lot of them came out and contributed.

0:08:19.480,0:08:26.320
The man of God also presented it
 to me - an additional two million naira,

0:08:26.320,0:08:30.780
apart from the one million naira he had given me.

0:08:30.780,0:08:35.840
I am now the owner of 3,000,000 naira from my daddy,

0:08:35.840,0:08:40.120
Prophet T. B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:08:40.120,0:08:45.720
I am so happy; the follow-up he did is too much for me.

0:08:45.720,0:08:47.480
I never expected this.

0:08:47.480,0:08:52.640
I want to use this opportunity to thank Prophet T. B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

0:08:52.640,0:08:57.400
for all their hospitality and kind gestures towards me.

0:08:57.400,0:09:02.200
They have changed my life not only materially but also spiritually,

0:09:02.200,0:09:08.940
because since being here, I have been receiving prayer, attending Bible class.

0:09:08.940,0:09:13.000
and praying all the time. I am now really 
born again.

0:09:13.000,0:09:17.520
I am now closer to God and I will
 never go back again in my life.

0:09:17.520,0:09:20.320
Nothing will make me go back again because I have seen that

0:09:20.320,0:09:22.680
a person who is in the Lord has everything

0:09:22.680,0:09:27.540
and in the Lord, everything will come, even in a way you did not expect.

0:09:27.540,0:09:29.960
More blessings are coming from God.

0:09:29.960,0:09:33.240
God is my beginning and end.

0:09:33.240,0:09:38.680
I have given my life wholeheartedly to God from today henceforth.

0:09:38.680,0:09:40.060
Thank You, Lord.

0:09:40.060,0:09:45.120
We are advising you to live your 
life to please God.

0:09:45.120,0:09:49.780
You are healed, delivered and
blessed to stay and follow Christ.

0:09:49.780,0:09:55.380
God Almighty will strengthen you to follow Him in truth and in His way in Jesus Christ's name.

0:09:55.380,0:09:59.420
Amen. I am a child of God.

0:09:59.420,0:10:05.160
Thank You, Jesus, for blessing me,
for using Prophet T. B. Joshua

0:10:05.160,0:10:10.860
and Emmanuel TV Partners for 
blessing me spiritually and materially.

0:10:10.860,0:10:13.060
Thank You, Jesus!

0:10:13.060,0:10:19.140
My advice to the world is that you should hold on to God anyhwere you are

0:10:19.140,0:10:24.220
and in every situation because you with God are majority.

0:10:24.220,0:10:26.660
Don't give up because you say that you don't have anybody.

0:10:26.660,0:10:29.160
You with God are majority.

0:10:29.160,0:10:34.940
As Christians, remember that in the 
world that cares less, we should care more

0:10:34.940,0:10:38.080
because whatever you give to the relief of the poor

0:10:38.080,0:10:41.800
and for God's support, that you give unto God.

0:10:41.800,0:10:45.820
This is a remarkable day in the life of Mrs Josephine Iweke

0:10:45.820,0:10:49.180
as she says, Thank You, Jesus, for everything.

0:10:49.180,0:10:54.940
