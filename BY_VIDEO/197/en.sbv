God is still saying something.

0:00:05.600,0:00:08.900
During a live service at The SCOAN,

0:00:08.900,0:00:15.620
Prophet T.B Joshua gave a prophecy concerning Abuja, the capital of Nigeria.

0:00:15.620,0:00:17.760
These were his words:

0:00:17.760,0:00:20.880
Listen to me, my people in Nigeria.

0:00:20.880,0:00:25.260
Once again, take note of this:

0:00:25.260,0:00:29.960
Our security should be vigilant.

0:00:29.960,0:00:36.000
I am seeing a very big strike - explosion.

0:00:36.000,0:00:43.080
They should take care of Abuja - capital.

0:00:43.080,0:00:48.780
When I talk, you see me in a bad light, but I will keep talking.

0:00:48.780,0:00:51.400
I don't need to say the state, but I am saying it.

0:00:51.400,0:00:54.020
This is what I am seeing happen in Abuja.

0:00:54.020,0:00:55.800
They should pray!

0:00:55.800,0:00:58.560
What can they do to capture this?

0:00:58.560,0:01:04.460
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
