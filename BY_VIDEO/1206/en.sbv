Viewers all over the world, begin to reason with yourself right now.

0:00:08.880,0:00:15.720
Reason with yourself - you will see what satan might have used.

0:00:15.720,0:00:21.280
You will see what satan is using to connect you to himself.

0:00:21.280,0:00:26.660
He wants you to be unhappy, he wants you to be sad.

0:00:26.660,0:00:32.440
He wants you to look at Jesus in a bad light.

0:00:32.440,0:00:42.380
Reason with yourself - you will see what satan is using to connect you to himself.

0:00:42.380,0:00:54.440
It can be sickness, infirmity, stagnation, nightmares, loneliness or depression.

0:00:54.440,0:00:57.700
These are the tools of satan.

0:00:57.700,0:01:04.560
Whatever satan might have been using to connect you to himself -

0:01:04.560,0:01:14.460
be broken, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:14.460,0:01:25.020
You want to be happy, but when this pain, affliction and whatever challenging situation comes,

0:01:25.020,0:01:27.560
it changes your joy.

0:01:27.560,0:01:35.160
Be broken, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:35.160,0:01:38.660
When Jesus says, "Yes", no one can say, "No".

0:01:38.660,0:01:42.880
I can hear chains falling!

0:01:42.880,0:01:49.980
Chains of setback - I can hear chains falling!

0:01:49.980,0:01:56.660
Chains of stagnation - I can hear chains falling!

0:01:56.660,0:02:03.720
Chains of failure - I can hear chains falling!

0:02:03.720,0:02:08.540
Chains!

0:02:08.540,0:02:11.620
