0:00:00.080,0:00:08.020
Come on, give the Lord a shout in here!

0:00:08.020,0:00:11.680
Hallelujah - as we continue to lift up the name of Jesus!

0:00:11.680,0:00:25.060
Hallelujah You have won the victory

0:00:25.060,0:00:27.840
Lift up your voice and say:

0:00:27.840,0:00:41.280
Hallelujah You have won it all for me

0:00:41.280,0:00:49.120
Death could not hold You down

0:00:49.120,0:00:56.480
You are the risen King

0:00:56.480,0:01:04.580
Seated in Majesty

0:01:04.580,0:01:10.560
You are the risen King

0:01:10.560,0:01:16.740
Death could not hold You down

0:01:16.740,0:01:24.620
You are the risen King

0:01:24.620,0:01:31.200
Seated in Majesty

0:01:31.200,0:01:39.960
You are the risen King

0:01:39.960,0:01:41.600
Let me say it like this:

0:01:41.600,0:01:45.080
Death could not hold You down

0:01:45.080,0:01:48.820
The grave could not contain You

0:01:48.820,0:01:52.480
Because You have risen

0:01:52.480,0:01:56.200
Now I have a reason

0:01:56.200,0:01:59.680
A reason to praise You

0:01:59.680,0:02:03.800
And live my life for You

0:02:03.800,0:02:07.440
Precious Redeemer

0:02:07.440,0:02:11.160
You reign forever

0:02:11.160,0:02:14.580
Death could not hold You down

0:02:14.580,0:02:18.280
The grave could not contain You

0:02:18.280,0:02:21.920
Because You have risen

0:02:21.920,0:02:25.580
We all have a reason

0:02:25.580,0:02:29.240
A reason to praise Your name

0:02:29.240,0:02:33.120
And live my life for You

0:02:33.120,0:02:36.820
Precious Redeemer

0:02:36.820,0:02:40.460
You reign forever

0:02:40.460,0:02:47.800
Death could not hold You down

0:02:47.800,0:02:51.660
You are the risen King

0:02:51.660,0:02:58.720
Seated in majesty

0:02:58.720,0:03:00.480
We love You

0:03:00.480,0:03:13.640
You are the risen King

0:03:13.640,0:03:18.840
Good Morning, Church!

0:03:18.840,0:03:20.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:20.820,0:03:23.600
Thank you.

0:03:23.600,0:03:28.880
Happy New Year!

0:03:28.880,0:03:35.180
I know you are feeling the atmosphere by faith.

0:03:35.180,0:03:37.460
Thank you. Hallelujah.

0:03:37.460,0:03:43.500
Viewers all over the world, Happy New Year!

0:03:43.500,0:03:48.940
By faith, you have been ushered to the New Year!

0:03:48.940,0:03:50.320
Hallelujah.

0:03:50.320,0:03:56.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:56.380,0:04:02.020
Hallelujah!

0:04:02.020,0:04:11.120
I know the thinking of every Christian is how to remain focused.

0:04:11.120,0:04:14.900
Our Christian life demands for that.

0:04:14.900,0:04:18.980
I say, "Remain focused".

0:04:18.980,0:04:26.660
No matter what happens, no matter what comes, your focus should not be broken.

0:04:26.660,0:04:28.340
Your focus should not be what?

0:04:28.340,0:04:29.460
Broken.

0:04:29.460,0:04:31.460
Hallelujah!

0:04:31.460,0:04:42.800
Let us just reflect about the year we are waiting for, the outgoing and incoming year.

0:04:42.800,0:04:53.000
To many others, the New Year is one with a new possession -

0:04:53.000,0:05:04.360
a new house, cars, friends, children, a new job, relations.

0:05:04.360,0:05:05.500
Just think about that.

0:05:05.500,0:05:18.160
To many others, they think they are fulfilled when they have all these.

0:05:18.160,0:05:23.860
To them, it is a New Year indeed.

0:05:23.860,0:05:37.220
A New Year is a gift from God - a part of divine nature of God.

0:05:37.220,0:05:41.040
If the New Year is a part of the divine nature of God,

0:05:41.040,0:05:52.540
in the New Year, therefore, you are called to God's kind of lifestyle - His divine essence,

0:05:52.540,0:06:02.440
not in terms of unfaithfulness, injustice and corruption

0:06:02.440,0:06:10.480
but of steadfastness, faithfulness and love.

0:06:10.480,0:06:20.820
I want to remind you the promise of God, the New Morning Water is out for the year.

0:06:20.820,0:06:36.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:36.280,0:06:46.020
Now, it is time for the work of faith. It takes faith to receive it.

0:06:46.020,0:07:00.680
It's out to fight the hardship and demon that cause you to lose control and commit shameful acts.

0:07:00.680,0:07:02.960
It's out to fight it!

0:07:02.960,0:07:04.220
That is it.

0:07:04.220,0:07:08.780
I will have a great relief this new year because of this.

0:07:08.780,0:07:10.720
A great relief.

0:07:10.720,0:07:15.440
Because when you have it, you only come and gives thanks to God.

0:07:15.440,0:07:18.020
Ok. This is it.

0:07:18.020,0:07:19.440
Thank you.

0:07:19.440,0:07:24.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:24.580,0:07:26.200
Thank you.

0:07:26.200,0:07:32.500
Remember, God is the reason for the year.

0:07:32.500,0:07:33.940
Tell your neighbour.

0:07:33.940,0:07:43.940
Remember, God is the reason for the year.

0:07:43.940,0:07:52.180
Nothing of God can be possible without our heart being pure.

0:07:52.180,0:08:00.120
That is why you keep trying and trying by error; it is not possible.

0:08:00.120,0:08:03.380
God is the reason for the year.

0:08:03.380,0:08:14.080
Nothing of God can be possible unless our heart is pure.

0:08:14.080,0:08:28.820
Christ tells us in Matthew 5:8, 'Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall see God in the year'.

0:08:28.820,0:08:36.340
That is why you keep trying and trying, writing application, doing this and that, praying

0:08:36.340,0:08:46.320
because your heart is not pure - grudges, pain of the past, holding offence.

0:08:46.320,0:08:56.460
Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us - this is our confession but we fail to follow this.

0:08:56.460,0:09:07.580
Nothing of God can be possible unless our heart is pure.

0:09:07.580,0:09:17.200
You have to dedicate your heart to the Word of God.

0:09:17.200,0:09:25.820
The Word of God is not to memorise but mediate on it day and night.

0:09:25.820,0:09:31.460
I mean, you have to abide in the Word.

0:09:31.460,0:09:42.180
Let the Word of God abide in you and you abide in it.

0:09:42.180,0:09:44.440
Look at my Faith Bracelet.

0:09:44.440,0:09:46.860
This is why we came out with this.

0:09:46.860,0:09:48.220
My own is here.

0:09:48.220,0:09:52.220
That is why we came out with this - to help you.

0:09:52.220,0:09:56.740
As you are sitting now, you are supposed to fire on.

0:09:56.740,0:10:03.180
Take more of me, give me more of You, oh Lord Jesus.

0:10:03.180,0:10:07.980
This is what we mean by meditating on it day and night.

0:10:07.980,0:10:13.420
All those days in the house, you sit watching your television,

0:10:13.420,0:10:15.420
watching all sorts of programmes.

0:10:15.420,0:10:19.580
As you are watching your programme, fire on.

0:10:19.580,0:10:25.460
It is not every time you can go to your altar on your knees and pray before going to sleep.

0:10:25.460,0:10:27.600
Sometimes, you get so tired.

0:10:27.600,0:10:31.820
You just go on your bed, let it be in your hand, 'Take more of me, give me more of You'

0:10:31.820,0:10:35.580
and you sleep off.

0:10:35.580,0:10:40.400
Inside the plane, inside the vehicle.

0:10:40.400,0:10:45.120
But people seem to turn it to fashion now.

0:10:45.120,0:10:46.800
When they are going, they ask, "Which colour?"

0:10:46.800,0:10:50.920
"Blue, red, yellow..."

0:10:50.920,0:10:53.040
Well done.

0:10:53.040,0:11:04.460
Nothing of God can be possible unless your heart is pure.

0:11:04.460,0:11:08.380
Pure means free spirit.

0:11:08.380,0:11:12.920
But your heart is not free.

0:11:12.920,0:11:17.920
You think of affliction, your problem, this and that,

0:11:17.920,0:11:21.980
how to get this, how to celebrate the new year.

0:11:21.980,0:11:24.720
What is that?

0:11:24.720,0:11:30.280
You need a free spirit to contact the Spirit of God.

0:11:30.280,0:11:37.400
Nothing of God can be possible unless your heart is free.

0:11:37.400,0:11:43.400
Dedicate your heart to the Word of God.

0:11:43.400,0:11:46.580
This will help you to dedicate it.

0:11:46.580,0:11:58.940
By the time you continue to meditate on it, it will become an integral part of your being.

0:11:58.940,0:12:04.340
'Take more of me, give me more of You.'

0:12:04.340,0:12:09.860
You have to dedicate your heart to the Word of God.

0:12:09.860,0:12:17.360
Meditate on it day and night.

0:12:17.360,0:12:23.260
Let the Word abide in you and you in it.

0:12:23.260,0:12:33.960
To have a new beginning which we call New Year, the Word of God must dominate your heart.

0:12:33.960,0:12:40.740
It's not just by reading but by meditation. 
Meditation brings revelation.

0:12:40.740,0:12:51.200
Then, you can stop looking and thinking about where you are coming from.

0:12:51.200,0:12:57.860
We are coming from unrighteousness which boasts in itself.

0:12:57.860,0:13:01.840
When we have breakthrough, we say, "Hey, it's by our hard work!"

0:13:01.840,0:13:08.040
But when failure comes, you begin to look for a scapegoat.

0:13:08.040,0:13:13.000
"Why does God not answer me? I attend church regularly."

0:13:13.000,0:13:17.600
But when you are okay, you never...

0:13:17.600,0:13:23.260
This coming year - I'm supposed to bring the revelation, what you should expect next year.

0:13:23.260,0:13:25.520
I compiled everything.

0:13:25.520,0:13:31.160
I was just looking at it. Many of those things are things you already know about

0:13:31.160,0:13:40.860
because the signs we are seeing now cannot be overcome in just one year.

0:13:40.860,0:13:54.600
This coming year is a year you must be ready to fight the battle to survive.

0:13:54.600,0:13:58.240
Think of your survival.

0:13:58.240,0:14:09.380
It's a year your children need to sit at your feet and learn from you.

0:14:09.380,0:14:16.380
Share your experience with them - it's a parable.

0:14:16.380,0:14:19.860
I will bring the prophecies to you.

0:14:19.860,0:14:25.320
But I don't know...

0:14:25.320,0:14:34.540
Before I give them to you, take your time to go through what I said last year.

0:14:34.540,0:14:39.420
Go and read more about what I said last year.

0:14:39.420,0:14:43.000
Just look at what I said last year

0:14:43.000,0:14:48.380
so that when you receive this, you will not be ignorant.

0:14:48.380,0:15:01.900
We are in a warfare where the serious-minded will be victorious.

0:15:01.900,0:15:06.580
When you dedicate your heart to the Word of God,

0:15:06.580,0:15:16.400
you have that ability from God to stop looking or thinking about where you are coming from

0:15:16.400,0:15:18.980
and start looking at where you are going.

0:15:18.980,0:15:21.060
That is the ability from God.

0:15:21.060,0:15:29.080
It's not possible for anyone to say, "No, I forget about the past", without God

0:15:29.080,0:15:35.360
because it's only that information satan has about you - your past.

0:15:35.360,0:15:42.960
It appears that it is the only information satan has - your past.

0:15:42.960,0:15:47.600
