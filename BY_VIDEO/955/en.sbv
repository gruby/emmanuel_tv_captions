On 19th of September 2017 a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the nation of Mexico

0:00:09.780,0:00:19.020
causing the collapse of many buildings and resulting in 370 fatalities and 6,000 injuries.

0:00:19.020,0:00:27.540
The devastating earthquake left thousands homeless and desperate without water, food or electricity

0:00:27.540,0:00:35.400
and grieving the loss of loved ones that did not survive.

0:00:35.400,0:00:41.420
Moved by compassion, Prophet TB Joshua sent the Emmanuel TV team and partners

0:00:41.420,0:00:48.380
to the affected areas in Mexico to bring help to the helpless and hope to the hopeless.

0:00:48.380,0:00:54.840
Join us in this love work as we reach out to the people of Mexico, knowing that as Christians

0:00:54.840,0:00:58.960
we are called to respond to all human needs.

A magnitude-7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico on September the 19th, 2017

0:01:19.180,0:01:24.400
striking suddenly and leaving nothing, but destruction in its wake.

0:01:24.400,0:01:30.720
The Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief Team sent by TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners worldwide

0:01:30.720,0:01:37.040
to assist with the survivors and search and rescue teams who are racing against time to save lives

0:01:37.040,0:01:41.620
had arrived in Mexico city the day after the central earthquake.

0:01:41.620,0:01:47.540
The officers in the green uniforms explained that the first need was to transport some food and water

0:01:47.540,0:01:53.660
which had been donated to a local reception center to one of the emergency medical centers in the city.

0:01:53.660,0:02:00.160
The Emmanuel TV vehicles pull up and are quickly loaded with the fresh food, bread and water

0:02:00.160,0:02:04.460
for the emergency medical center on the other side of the city and as fast as possible

0:02:04.460,0:02:09.460
the team were off to deliver their precious cargo at the Medical Center.

0:02:09.460,0:02:16.640
Volunteers spring into action alongside the team to get them much-needed water and food to those who need it,

0:02:16.640,0:02:21.033
both those working in the search an -rescue mission and those being rescued

0:02:21.040,0:02:24.280
from the rubble of crushed buildings.

Emmanuel TV Team Transports Food And Water For The Emergency Rescue Center

0:02:56.460,0:03:02.300
While delivering supplies to the emergency medical center, the doctors there explained an urgent need

0:03:02.300,0:03:06.079
to send some medical supplies to one particular search and rescue zone

0:03:06.079,0:03:09.740
and they asked the Emmanuel TV team's help.

0:03:09.740,0:03:13.900
These are some of the supplies to be delivered to the wanting search and rescue zone -

0:03:13.900,0:03:19.440
medical fluids, medications, pain killers, neck collars, first aid essentials

0:03:19.440,0:03:23.080
and equipment for treating and dressing wounds.

Led by one of the doctors the Emmanuel TV team arrives in the search and rescue zone.

0:03:41.520,0:03:46.720
Getting as close as they can by car, they take the supplies and continue on foot

0:03:46.720,0:03:51.700
making their way through the  streets to the temporary store.

Emmanuel TV Assists Doctors To Carry Emergency Medical Supplies For Search And Rescue Teams

0:03:59.620,0:04:05.180
Everywhere you can see volunteers wearing masks and hard hats as safety precautions,

0:04:05.180,0:04:13.260
as they are organized into groups to help with the rescue work.

0:04:13.260,0:04:18.800
On arrival at the scene, the rescue workers were making arrangements to have light and generators

0:04:18.800,0:04:26.560
to enable them to work into the night, as the time is short for those trapped in the wreckage.

0:04:26.560,0:04:34.380
Several 20 litre kegs are purchased by the Emmanuel TV team and here they fill them with the necessary fuel

0:04:34.380,0:04:37.100
and return to the search and rescue zone.

0:04:37.100,0:04:45.740
The Emmanuel TV Team Buys And Delivers Fuel For Search And Rescue Lighting Generators

0:04:45.740,0:04:51.220
The work was still going on strong as they carry the fuel into the building sites

0:04:51.220,0:04:54.700
where the generators were being set up.

0:05:09.440,0:05:18.620
Meanwhile, the industrial crane hoists a huge slab of concrete rubble away from the rescue zone.

0:05:18.620,0:05:25.100
But while the world's attention is on the capital city, many in poor villages in the south of Mexico

0:05:25.100,0:05:32.080
which were devastated by the even stronger 8.2 magnitude earthquake on the 7th of September

0:05:32.080,0:05:33.940
are still struggling.

0:05:33.940,0:05:42.720
So the Emmanuel TV team decides to make the long journey by road to Oaxaca state to lend a helping hand.

0:05:42.720,0:05:46.980
So having seen the plight of our brothers and sisters in Oaxaca state,

0:05:46.980,0:05:52.720
an Emmanuel TV team here in Mexico city is now preparing for the very long journey

0:05:52.720,0:06:01.320
carrying with us more than 500 boxes ready to be packed full of food and hygiene supplies

0:06:01.320,0:06:05.520
for the affected families down in Oaxaca state.

0:06:05.520,0:06:07.600
As TB Joshua has taught us:

0:06:07.600,0:06:14.720
"God blesses us not only that we may earn a living, but so that we are able to give".

0:06:14.720,0:06:45.660
The Journey From Mexico City To Oaxaca State

0:06:45.660,0:06:50.580
The Emmanual TV team has arrived here in southern Oaxaca state in Mexico,

0:06:50.580,0:06:57.440
the area which was devastated by the massive earthquake on the 7th of September.

0:06:57.440,0:07:07.880
The team is here going to collect and pack the food and the hygiene items into the over 500 multi-purpose boxes.

0:07:07.880,0:07:14.660
The families in this area in 3 different villages are waiting for help.

0:07:14.660,0:07:21.620
As TB Joshua has taught us: "Someone is waiting for you for a lifetime".

0:07:21.620,0:07:24.860
"Failing them is failing God."

0:07:24.860,0:07:29.740
Purchasing The Bulk Food And Hygiene Supplies From A Wholesale Warehouse

0:07:29.740,0:07:36.000
The Emmanuel TV team moves straight to a wholesale warehouse in the nearest large town in Oaxaca state

0:07:36.000,0:07:43.040
to pay for and collect the pre-ordered food and hygiene supplies for the earthquake survivors and rescue teams.

0:07:43.040,0:07:49.280
The warehouse crew used trolleys and forklift trucks to load the large pallets of pre-ordered goods

0:07:49.280,0:07:53.700
for the Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief into the delivery lorry.

0:07:53.700,0:07:57.100
Purchasing The Bulk Food And Hygiene Supplies From A Wholesale Warehouse

0:07:57.100,0:08:03.520
This truck was provided by a local businessman to the Emmanuel TV team to help in the transportation

0:08:03.520,0:08:07.260
of the supplies from the warehouse to the affected areas.

0:08:07.260,0:08:14.180
The loading process begins - first with the large weighty pallets and plastic wrapped cartons,

0:08:14.180,0:08:17.860
then with individual boxes and cartons of supplies,

0:08:17.860,0:08:21.860
to make sure as much as possible can be contained in the trucks.

0:08:21.860,0:08:26.680
The process repeats for the second truck, stacking the items as high as they can go,

0:08:26.680,0:08:29.000
until there is no more space left.

0:08:29.000,0:08:35.040
Now loaded full of essential food and hygiene supplies, the Emmanuel TV team sets off on their journey

0:08:35.040,0:08:42.400
to Juchitán, where the aid will be distributed to over 500 families that have been affected by the earthquake.

0:08:42.400,0:09:00.060
The Emmanuel TV Trucks Transport Food And Hygiene Supplies To The Temporary Logistics Centre

0:09:00.060,0:09:06.220
Arriving in Juchitan the vehicles enter the compound that will be used as a logistic center

0:09:06.220,0:09:11.680
to sort, pack and store the supplies for distribution to the needy villages.

0:09:11.680,0:09:17.120
Inside the base, Mexican volunteers assist the Emmanuel TV team to set out

0:09:17.120,0:09:22.160
the multi-purpose plastic boxes which will be given out one per family,

0:09:22.160,0:09:26.900
filled with the food and essential hygiene ítems brought from the warehouse.

0:09:26.900,0:09:33.420
While the colorful boxes were being set out, another group brings down the products from the trucks.

0:09:33.420,0:09:39.900
A last step before the boxes are filled is to decorate them with in an 'Emmanuel TV Disaster Relief' sticker.

0:09:39.900,0:09:45.540
These are the 500 boxes that will be given to families in the state of Oaxaca,

0:09:45.540,0:09:49.180
affected by the magnitude-8.2 earthquake.

0:09:49.180,0:09:54.260
Hello and good morning. We are here in Juchitan, in the State of Oaxaca,

0:09:54.260,0:10:00.160
in one of the municipalities affected by the earthquake of 7th September 2017.

0:10:00.160,0:10:05.780
As you can see behind me, we have here the food which will shortly be distributed

0:10:05.780,0:10:13.340
and packed into plastic boxes to take directly to those families with so much need.

0:10:13.340,0:10:18.680
Now the job of sorting out the different products and sharing them into the boxes begins.

0:10:18.680,0:10:25.940
Forming a chain the team swiftly sends the items along from the tables and places them into the waiting boxes.

0:10:25.940,0:10:33.140
The Food And Hygiene Supplies Are Packed Into The Over 500 Multi-Purpose Plastic Boxes

0:10:33.140,0:10:38.940
They start with some of the bulky items like storage boxes, paper towels and detergent

0:10:38.940,0:10:46.240
before adding tin foods cooking oil and other hygiene products. The momento note of encouragement reads:

0:10:46.240,0:10:52.720
"Remember that there is always Someone praying for you. You are not alone."

0:10:52.720,0:11:00.820
As we can see, the team is continuing to work to fill these boxes with basic food

0:11:00.820,0:11:09.060
and hygiene products that will be delivered to those families who are waiting for us.

0:11:09.060,0:11:13.540
Also Emmanuel TV has thought to reach these hearts and homes

0:11:13.540,0:11:20.540
with a small memento translated in the Huave language saying,

0:11:20.540,0:11:28.280
"Remember that there is always Someone praying for you. You are not alone".

0:11:28.280,0:11:33.520
After a good effort, the five hundred boxes have been filled with love and enough supplies

0:11:33.520,0:11:37.287
to make a big difference in the lives of those who will receive them.

0:11:37.287,0:11:43.580
The difficulties imposed by the powerful earthquake just over a week ago are still very much being felt

0:11:43.580,0:11:50.600
in the disadvantaged villages and areas of southern Oaxaca.

0:11:50.600,0:11:56.140
The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes Prepared For Earthquake Victims

0:11:56.140,0:12:02.980
With everything ready at last the Emmanuel TV team sets off early the next day to two different villages -

0:12:02.980,0:12:07.800
first San Mateo del Mar, an indigenous seaside fishing community

0:12:07.800,0:12:12.460
and Chi Kappa de Castro, an inland farming community a little further north.

0:12:12.460,0:12:16.680
The level of devastation on the lower quality structures from the quake,

0:12:16.680,0:12:23.000
which was over five hundred times more powerful than the one which hit Mexico city cannot be hidden.

My name is Jason nd my whole house fell down in the earthquake -

0:12:30.780,0:12:35.220
all our clothes are under the rubbles of the walls.

0:12:35.220,0:12:40.800
Material things do not matter; what matters is life and we are fine.

0:12:40.800,0:12:48.560
While many families lost their homes, their possessions and their livelihoods, some even lost their lives,

0:12:48.560,0:12:54.820
a bold sentiment from one so young but a sentiment that seemed shared among the villagers

0:12:54.820,0:13:01.360
who have already started doing what they can to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess the earthquake left behind

0:13:01.360,0:13:03.980
and get back to normal life again.

0:13:12.940,0:13:18.820
Here the Emmanuel TV team is led into the homes of some of the villagers to see the extent

0:13:18.820,0:13:24.540
of what the earthquake did - heavy furniture lies where the quake had thrown them down

0:13:24.540,0:13:28.340
and large cracks may be seen even in the concrete floor.

Families Gather To Receive The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief

0:13:45.060,0:13:51.320
Families from the villages gather to meet the Emmanuel TV team and receive from them the much-needed food,

0:13:51.320,0:13:59.400
hygiene supplies provided as an expression of love and solidarity by TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners.

0:13:59.400,0:14:04.960
Everybody from grandparents to grandchildren happily form a line as the preparations are made

0:14:04.960,0:14:10.820
for the distribution to begin. From the chairs scattered around you can tell they have been expecting

0:14:10.820,0:14:15.720
the arrival of the team with some excitement and are glad of the good news

0:14:15.720,0:14:21.600
that someone has been thinking about them, and that some relief has finally come.

0:14:21.600,0:14:26.120
The Emmanuel TV team sees it as a privilege to be in a position to help,

0:14:26.120,0:14:33.800
guided by the words of TB Joshua that giving is a real privilege, if it is done in a proper attitude.

0:14:33.800,0:14:39.000
Those who are strong enough, take the boxes themselves with a heat and a smile,

0:14:39.000,0:14:43.700
while the elderly or weaker members of the community are assisted by the volunteers.

The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief Boxes Are Presented To Needy Family

0:15:17.900,0:15:24.860
The grateful families express their thanks for the provisions, which will go a long way to meet their needs

0:15:24.860,0:15:27.120
in these trying times.

0:15:27.120,0:15:32.360
The team takes a moment to explain to this elderly woman the contents of the box she's receiving

0:15:32.360,0:15:34.480
and she nods with satisfaction.

0:15:34.480,0:15:40.260
The expression of their faces encourages those waiting on the line that it is well worth the wait.

0:15:40.260,0:15:47.440
More and more families receive the food and hygiene gift boxes and express both their surprise and thanks

0:15:47.440,0:15:50.720
for both the gift freely given and the hearts behind it.

Thanks for the support. The earthquake damaged our house

0:16:58.720,0:17:02.760
and many people have nowhere to live, nowhere to stay.

0:17:22.680,0:17:28.720
My experience in the earthquake is something horrible.

0:17:28.720,0:17:37.720
I could not go out with my children, I had to stay there locked up with my two little ones.

0:17:37.720,0:17:43.900
I believed that at that moment the house was going to fall down.

0:17:43.900,0:17:52.780
Everything began to fall down and all I could do was to hold my children

0:17:52.780,0:17:55.700
and give them refuge in my arms.

0:17:55.700,0:18:01.860
We just prayed and thanked God that He would cover and protect us.

0:18:01.860,0:18:08.980
Many thanks Emmanuel TV for this opportunity and for this support that you have sent us

0:18:08.980,0:18:14.520
here in the village of "Ikoots" people. Many thanks from my heart.

0:18:14.520,0:18:21.060
I receive this on behalf of my mother and I thank God for remembering us

0:18:21.060,0:18:23.620
and may God give you more.

0:18:23.620,0:18:28.660
It is hard for me to speak about it because I lost my father.

0:18:28.660,0:18:36.460
I thank God that you are here supporting us; many thanks and may God give you all long life.

We give thanks to Emmanuel TV for this support, which for us is very significant

0:19:07.080,0:19:12.340
since in these times we are going through many difficult things.

0:19:37.260,0:19:41.660
Some families traveled quite a distance from the surrounding areas

0:19:41.660,0:19:45.760
and hearing that the Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief team was coming.

0:19:45.760,0:19:51.280
Happily, they bought different vehicles able to return home with a degree of satisfaction

0:19:51.280,0:19:53.640
for their successful journey.

0:19:53.640,0:20:00.460
Others who live nearby take the stroll home proudly holding their gift boxes for all to see

0:20:00.460,0:20:03.040
and others wait in the shade for their transportation.

0:20:03.040,0:20:11.420
It is amazing to see the impact a simple gift can bring.  For love is a language that transcends all boundaries,

0:20:11.420,0:20:14.340
understood by both young and old alike.

0:21:29.700,0:21:33.660

Villager From Chicapa de Castro Explains Her Loss Of Livelihood

Leticia Lopez Orozco
Chicapa de Castro

0:21:59.100,0:22:05.340
I lost my pot and part of my house in the earthquake.

0:22:05.340,0:22:12.300
I was making tortillas for a living to support my children

0:22:12.300,0:22:16.840
because my husband is a farmer and he has almost no work,

0:22:16.840,0:22:22.520
so we were living from that with my five children.

The Emmanuel TV Team At The Earthquake Damaged Areas In Oaxaca State, Mexico

0:22:36.620,0:22:41.420
Emanuel Santiago
Chicapa de Castro

0:22:41.420,0:22:48.020
This project idea was born after the severe earthquake here in Chicapa de Castro.

0:22:48.020,0:22:53.840
Many families were left without a livelihood following damage to the ovens they used

0:22:53.840,0:22:57.520
for hand-made tortillas which are a local speciality product

0:22:57.520,0:23:02.120
that generates employment here in the village.

0:23:02.120,0:23:10.080
The oven basically consists of a large pot in which the tortillas are made,

0:23:10.080,0:23:15.000
first kneading them and then sticking them to the edges of the pot

0:23:15.000,0:23:20.120
at a high temperature until the tortillas are cooked.

0:23:20.120,0:23:25.480
We need one hundred new ovens to reactivate the economy of Chicapa de Castro

0:23:25.480,0:23:29.160
and one hundred families will benefit from this.

0:23:29.160,0:23:34.020
So the Emmanuel TV team has heard about the wonderful project which you're doing

0:23:34.020,0:23:44.260
to restart the economy here in the village of Chicapa de Castro by providing the pot oven liners,

0:23:44.260,0:23:49.040
so that people can start to make the tortillas and earn a living again.

0:23:49.040,0:24:01.560
On behalf of T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners we'd like to sponsor 100 of these pottery oven liners

0:24:01.560,0:24:09.280
and it would give us great pleasure therefore to present you with thirty-five thousand pesos

0:24:09.280,0:24:14.800
for the manufacture of the oven liners and for the transport.

0:24:14.800,0:24:21.260
Many thanks for this assistance because it is going to benefit many families here in Chicapa de Castro.

0:24:21.260,0:24:23.860
With all my heart, many thanks Emmanuel TV.

0:24:23.860,0:24:28.400
Thank you for your help with all my heart, Emmanuel TV.

The Location Of Santa Maria Del Mar Accessible Only By Sea

0:24:39.400,0:24:42.040
The next port of call was Santa Maria Del Mar,

0:24:42.040,0:24:49.020
a secluded village community accessible only by water. On the way to Santa Maria Del Mar

0:24:49.020,0:24:55.380
the team traverse a rough track to the shoreline where the boats have been arranged to take the team across

0:24:55.380,0:25:01.440
to another area affected by the earthquake that has received little or no assistance at all.

0:25:01.440,0:25:05.480
The Departure Point For Boats To Santa Maria Del Mar

0:25:05.480,0:25:10.240
Just as Jesus Christ himself is the solution to the problems of all mankind,

0:25:10.240,0:25:16.120
so He expects us to be a solution to someone in trouble.

0:25:16.120,0:25:23.380
This is a coastal area of Oaxaca state known as El Faro,

0:25:23.380,0:25:33.340
where the boats come to take people to a very remote and isolated village called Santa Maria Del Mar

0:25:33.340,0:25:40.660
and the Emmanuel TV team right now is preparing to take boxes with food and hygiene provisions

0:25:40.660,0:25:43.640
to this isolated community.

0:25:43.640,0:25:51.940
The Loading Of Boats For Santa Maria Del Mar With The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes

0:25:51.940,0:25:57.640
The Emmanuel TV team's vehicle reverses into a good position to allow the team to load

0:25:57.640,0:26:04.240
the precious cargo of food and hygiene supplies into the boat for transportation across the sea.

0:26:04.240,0:26:07.760
Everybody lends a hand to get the scores of colourful boxes

0:26:07.760,0:26:12.220
of much-needed supplies properly stowed in the boats.

0:26:12.220,0:26:18.240
The well-worn wooden slats make a good platform for wedging the boxes squarely into the boat,

0:26:18.240,0:26:21.060
so that they won't topple over during the voyage.

0:26:21.060,0:26:27.320
The Emmanuel TV team forms a chain with the local fishermen to quickly pass the boxes into the boats

0:26:27.320,0:26:32.200
and as the saying goes: "Many hands make light work."

The Loading Of Boats For Santa Maria Del Mar With The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes

0:26:42.460,0:26:47.740
With the boats loaded up, they are covered in a thick green tarpaulin to protect the relief boxes

0:26:47.740,0:26:54.540
and their precious contents from the elements. Finally, fastening the whole thing securely with strong ropes

0:26:54.540,0:26:58.200
the boats were ready to depart for Santa Maria Del Mar.

0:26:58.200,0:27:03.200
A light rain began to fall as the team pushes off from the shore.

The fishermen navigate the beautiful, clear waters of the Pacific Ocean, as we head to the remote village.

0:27:21.320,0:27:26.920
In different circumstances the surroundings could make for a perfect holiday getaway

0:27:26.920,0:27:32.060
but after the violence of the earthquake, the isolation from the rest of the world

0:27:32.060,0:27:36.960
just makes help all the harder to come by.

0:27:36.960,0:27:57.340
The Emmanuel TV Team And Relief Boxes On The Boat Journey To Santa Maria Del Mar

0:27:57.340,0:28:03.440
Traveling in tandem, the boats move as fast as the heavy load of cargo and passengers can permit.

0:28:03.440,0:28:09.780
To clear the vast expanse of water the shore leading to the village comes into view on the horizon

0:28:09.780,0:28:13.660
and the boats reduce their speed as they near the land.

0:28:19.840,0:28:25.840
The expert fishermen maneuver the boats close to the shore to make a good approach for a safe landing.

0:28:25.840,0:28:32.800
Largely untouched the rustic setting boasts of only a few boats moored nearby.

0:28:32.800,0:28:40.300
As the first boat pulls gently onto the shore, the rain which had been their companion over the sea softens.

As the rain gradually dies down, the team once again form a chain

0:29:42.340,0:29:48.620
and pass the earthquake relief boxes quickly ashore stacking them high in the waiting vehicles.

0:29:48.620,0:29:52.040
Amazed at the effort of the team to reach the community

0:29:52.040,0:29:58.480
villagers are glad to assist in bringing the boxes out of the boats and loading them up.

Ciro Gonzalez Martinez
Santa Maria Del Mar

0:30:31.860,0:30:40.680
On September 7th, at about 10:30 pm we felt like a roar from this Pacific Ocean.

0:30:40.680,0:30:55.540
It felt very strong; my family were going to sleep when the sea suddenly gave a great long roar!

0:30:55.540,0:31:05.220
Everyone panicked and at that time, we were looking for how to get out of the house.

0:31:05.220,0:31:12.420
We heard noise and children crying and many fences and houses had collapsed

0:31:12.420,0:31:19.060
but I thank God that nothing serious happened to us, even though we live in an isolated village.

0:31:19.060,0:31:25.860
At this time, we thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners for collaborating

0:31:25.860,0:31:31.460
and donating, for giving their heart to Santa Maria Del Mar; we are very grateful.

The Emmanuel TV Team Journeys To The Village In Santa Maria Del Mar

0:31:34.040,0:31:39.480
A beautiful blue hue has returned to the skies, as the Emmanuel TV team

0:31:39.480,0:31:43.240
are driven along the winding path to the village community.

0:31:43.240,0:31:48.660
On arrival, help is at hand to unload the relief boxes as quickly as possible.

0:31:56.720,0:32:02.580
For outside, word of the Emmanuel TV team's arrival, has traveled fast

0:32:02.580,0:32:07.500
and already a line of people has formed to meet them and see what is going on.

0:32:07.500,0:32:12.440
More and more large families come on foot from the corners of the region.

0:32:12.440,0:32:17.440
Despite the recent disaster, the arrival of the Emmanuel TV team brings with it

0:32:17.440,0:32:21.740
an atmosphere of joy and happiness.

0:32:21.740,0:32:29.180
Families Gather To Receive The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief

0:32:29.180,0:32:35.500
And the residents smile and wave for the camera, as they await the proceedings to get underway.

0:32:35.500,0:32:40.260
Even the children are happy at all the excitement in their rural home.

0:32:40.260,0:32:46.800
Just as in the other communities: one big box of food and hygiene items is given per family

0:32:46.800,0:32:52.340
with some assistance on hand to help the weaker or more aged members of the community

0:32:52.340,0:32:59.280
to carry theirs home with them. Grateful receiving like gracious giving comes from the heart

0:32:59.280,0:33:02.900
and the expression on their faces says it all:

0:33:02.900,0:33:08.260
Thank you, Jesus Christ for remembering us in our time of need.

0:33:08.260,0:33:37.420

0:33:42.500,0:33:49.420
to hear what had happened to them and their beloved village during the quake. Let's listen to a few of them.

The day of the earthquake tragedy, was the day we thought would be our last day on earth

but thanks to God we are alive.

0:34:18.220,0:34:23.260

0:34:29.240,0:34:39.640
My experience with the earthquake was a very frightening night for me and my family.

0:34:39.640,0:34:44.840
I have two children - one is 10 years old, the other is 4 years old and my wife is pregnant.

0:34:44.840,0:34:49.700
On that day we were sleeping when the earthquake began.

0:34:49.700,0:34:53.700
The door got stuck and we could not leave the house.

0:34:53.700,0:34:58.960
I couldn´t leave my house and I couldn't do anything except have faith in God!

0:34:58.960,0:35:06.840
I thank Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua for visiting us,

0:35:06.840,0:35:16.760
traveling a very long distance to reach this village, which as you can see is in the middle of the sea.

0:35:16.760,0:35:25.060
Thank you Emmanuel TV for the relief boxes and for coming to give a moment of happiness

0:35:25.060,0:35:31.160
to the children, women and especially to the village of Santa Maria Del Mar.

The Emmanuel TV team also provided ingredients for the community to have a big meal together

0:35:43.200,0:35:47.940
following the distribution of the food and hygiene relief boxes.

0:35:47.940,0:35:53.240
Women of the region joyfully prepare the feast together, some making the special tortilla bread

0:35:53.240,0:35:58.120
in the traditional way sticking the dough to the round oven like pots,

0:35:58.120,0:36:02.120
while on the other side of the kitchen a large vat of rice

0:36:02.120,0:36:06.720
dotted with colorful slices of vegetables is simmering away nicely.

0:36:06.720,0:36:10.960
This woman keeps an experiencd eye on some beautifully seasoned shrimp

0:36:10.960,0:36:17.220
stirring it gently, just a little while longer, and the celebration will begin.

with a generous helping of the chicken sauce.

0:36:33.400,0:36:36.760
