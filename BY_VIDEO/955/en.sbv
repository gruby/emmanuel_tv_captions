On 19th of September 2017

0:00:04.960,0:00:08.760
a 7.1. Magnitude earthquake shook the nation of Mexico

0:00:09.700,0:00:12.820

0:00:13.060,0:00:16.620
and resulting in 370 fatalities

0:00:16.800,0:00:19.020
and 6,000 injuries

0:00:19.020,0:00:24.050
The devastating earthquake left thousands homeless and desperate

0:00:24.050,0:00:27.540
without wáter, food or electricity

0:00:27.540,0:00:29.560
and grieving the loss of loved ones

0:00:30.310,0:00:32.310
that did not survive

0:00:35.290,0:00:37.210
Moved by compassion

0:00:37.210,0:00:43.169
Prophet TB Joshua sent the Emmanual TV team and partners to the affected areas in Mexico

The emmanual TV Earthquake Relief, Mexico

0:01:12.020,0:01:18.760
A magnitude  7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico on September 19th 2017

0:01:19.120,0:01:23.960
Striking suddenly and leaving nothing, but destruction in its wake

0:01:24.340,0:01:30.420
The Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief Team sent by TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners worldwide

0:01:30.680,0:01:36.860
to assist with the survivors and search and rescue teams who are racing against time to save lives

0:01:37.000,0:01:41.140
had arrived in Mexico City the day after the central earthquake

0:01:41.560,0:01:47.380
The officers in the green uniforms explained that the first need was to transport some food and water

0:01:47.500,0:01:53.460
which had been donated to a local reception center to one of the emergency medical centers in the city

0:01:53.620,0:02:00.120
the Emmanuel TV vehicles pull up and are quickly loaded with the fresh food, bread and water for the

0:02:00.259,0:02:03.879
emergency medical center on the other side of the city and as fast as

0:02:04.040,0:02:08.770
possible the team were off to deliver their precious cargo at the Medical Center

0:02:09.410,0:02:16.359
volunteers spring into action alongside the team to get them much-needed water and food to those who need it

0:02:16.580,0:02:23.199
Both those working in the search and rescue mission and those rescued from the rubble of crushed buildings.

0:02:56.020,0:03:00.420
While delivering supplies to the emergency medical center the doctors there

0:03:00.660,0:03:05.960
Explained an urgent need to send some medical supplies to one particular search-and-rescue zone

0:03:05.960,0:03:09.580
and they asked the emanuel TV team's help.

0:03:09.720,0:03:12.340
These are some of the supplies to be delivered to the wanting

0:03:12.500,0:03:19.340
search-and-rescue zone Medical fluids medications pain killers neck collars first aid essentials

0:03:19.620,0:03:23.080
and equipment for treating and dressing wounds

0:03:36.260,0:03:41.120
Led by one of the doctors the Emmanuel TV team arrives in the search-and-rescue zone

0:03:41.440,0:03:48.120
getting as close as they can by car, they take the supplies and continue on foot making their way

0:03:48.200,0:03:51.700
through the  streets to the temporary store

0:03:59.540,0:04:01.280
Everywhere you can see

0:04:01.280,0:04:07.200
volunteers wearing masks and hard hats as safety precautions as they are organized into groups

0:04:07.360,0:04:10.540
to help with the rescue work.

0:04:13.220,0:04:17.860
On arrival at the scene, the rescue workers were making arrangements to have light and

0:04:18.120,0:04:24.700
generators to enable them to work into the night as the time is short for those trapped in the wreckage

0:04:26.600,0:04:30.900
Several 20 litre kegs are purchased by the emmanuel TV team and

0:04:31.260,0:04:37.100
here they fill them with the necessary fuel and return to the search-and-rescue zone

0:04:45.680,0:04:50.920
The work was still going on  strong as they carry the fuel into the building sites

0:04:51.140,0:04:54.700
where the generators were being set up

0:05:09.400,0:05:16.560
Meanwhile the industrial crane hoists a huge slab of concrete rubble away from the rescue zone

0:05:18.610,0:05:25.110
But while the world's attention is on the capital city many in poor villages in the south of Mexico

0:05:25.110,0:05:31.900
which were devastated by the even stronger 8.2 magnitude earthquake on the 7th of September

0:05:31.900,0:05:39.500
are still struggling.  So the Emmanuel TV team decides to make the long journey by road to Oaxaca state

0:05:40.000,0:05:44.609
to lend a helping hand...So having seen the plight of our brothers and sisters

0:05:44.769,0:05:52.229
in Oaxaca state.  An emmanuel TV team here in Mexico City is now preparing for the very long journey

0:05:52.680,0:05:55.840
carrying with us more than 500 boxes

0:05:56.320,0:06:04.180
ready to be packed full of food and hygiene supplies for the affected families down in Oaxaca State

0:06:04.720,0:06:07.300
as TB Joshua has taught us

0:06:07.480,0:06:14.160
"God blesses us not only that we may earn a living, but so that we are able to give"

0:06:45.429,0:06:51.749
The Emmanual TV team has arrived here in southern Oaxaca State in Mexico,  the area, which was

0:06:52.300,0:06:54.300
devastated by the massive earthquake

0:06:54.369,0:06:56.518
on the 7th of September

0:06:57.160,0:07:02.680
The team is here going to collect and pack the food and the hygiene items

0:07:03.360,0:07:07.400
into the over 500 multi-purpose boxes

0:07:07.840,0:07:13.120
The families in this área are  in 3 different villages are waiting for help

0:07:14.469,0:07:20.129
As TB Joshua has taught us: "Someone is waiting for you for a lifetime"

0:07:21.579,0:07:24.179
"Failing them is failing God."

0:07:29.460,0:07:36.000
The Emmanuel TV team moves straight to a wholesale warehouse in the nearest large town in Oaxaca State

0:07:36.000,0:07:42.920
to pay for and collect the pre-ordered food and hygiene supplies for the earthquake survivors and rescue teams

0:07:43.020,0:07:49.280
The warehouse crew used trolleys and forklift trucks to load the large pallets of pre-ordered goods

0:07:49.280,0:07:53.240
for the Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief into the delivery lorry

0:07:57.100,0:08:03.240
This truck was provided by a local businessman to the Emmanuel TV team to help in the transportation

0:08:03.480,0:08:08.640
of the supplies from the warehouse to the affected áreas.  The loading process begins.

0:08:09.309,0:08:13.379
First with the large weighty pallets and plastic wrapped cartons

0:08:13.779,0:08:15.928
then with individual boxes

0:08:16.240,0:08:21.700
and cartons of supplies, to make sure as much as possible can be contained in the trucks

0:08:21.820,0:08:26.680
the process repeats for the second truck, stacking the items as high as they can go

0:08:26.680,0:08:29.340
until there is no more space left

0:08:29.340,0:08:35.340
Now loaded full of essential food and hygiene supplies the Emmanuel TV teams set off on their journey

0:08:35.340,0:08:42.400
to Juchitán where the aid will be distributed to over 500 families that have been affected by the earthquake.

0:09:00.040,0:09:05.660
Arriving in Juchitan the vehicles enter the compound that will be used as a logistic Center

0:09:06.160,0:09:11.680
to sort, pack and store the supplies for distribution to the needy villages

0:09:11.680,0:09:17.320
inside the base Mexican volunteers assist the Emmanuel TV team to set out their

0:09:17.600,0:09:24.360
multi-purpose plastic boxes which will be given out,, one per family, filled with the food and essential

0:09:24.480,0:09:26.540
hygiene ítems brought from the warehouse

0:09:26.880,0:09:29.300
while the colorful boxes were being set out

0:09:29.750,0:09:33.100
another group brings down the products from the trucks a

0:09:33.380,0:09:39.670
A last step before the boxes are filled is to decorate them with in a emmanual TV disaster relief sticker

0:09:39.890,0:09:44.650
These are the 500 boxes that will be given to families in the state of, Oaxaca?

0:09:45.470,0:09:48.399
affected by the magnitude 8.2 earthquake

0:09:50.150,0:09:56.439
 

0:09:56.440,0:10:00.580
 

0:10:00.580,0:10:02.580
 

0:10:02.880,0:10:10.720
 

0:10:13.300,0:10:17.920
Now the job of sorting out the different products and sharing them into the boxes begins.

0:10:18.650,0:10:25.959
Forming a chain the team swiftly sends the items along from the tables and places them into the waiting boxes

0:10:33.100,0:10:38.699
They start with some of the bulky items like storage boxes paper towels and detergent

0:10:38.860,0:10:45.690
before adding tin foods cooking oil and other hygiene products the momento note of encouragement reads

0:10:46.180,0:10:50.669
Remember:  "That there is always someone praying for you. You are not alone."

0:10:52.660,0:10:56.189
 

0:10:56.530,0:11:01.290
 

0:11:02.260,0:11:07.859
 

0:11:08.530,0:11:15.660
 

0:11:16.060,0:11:19.590
 

0:11:20.140,0:11:25.229
 

0:11:28.240,0:11:33.520
After a good effort the 500 boxes have been filled with love and enough supplies

0:11:33.520,0:11:38.780
to make a big difference in the lives of those who will receive them.  The difficulties imposed by the

0:11:38.920,0:11:45.260
powerful earthquake just over a week ago are still very much being felt in the disadvantaged villages

0:11:45.260,0:11:48.100
and areas of southern, Oaxaca

0:11:50.540,0:12:03.060
With everything ready at last the Emmanuel TV team sets off early the next day to two different villages first

0:12:03.200,0:12:07.800
San Mateo del mar  an indigenous seaside fishing community and Chi

0:12:07.810,0:12:11.919
Kappa de Castro an inland farming community a little further north

0:12:12.440,0:12:17.799
The level of devastation on the lower quality structures from the quake, which was over five hundred

0:12:18.050,0:12:22.780
times more powerful than the one which hit Mexico City cannot be hidden

0:12:40.760,0:12:45.010
While many families lost their homes their possessions and their livelihoods

0:12:45.740,0:12:48.040
some even lost their lives a

0:12:48.440,0:12:51.520
bold sentiment from one so young but a

0:12:51.680,0:12:57.200
sentiment that seemed shared among the villagers who have already started doing what they can

0:12:57.200,0:13:03.980
to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess the earthquake left behind and get back to normal life again

0:13:12.840,0:13:19.260
Here the Emmanuel TV team is led into the homes of some of the villagers to see the extent of what

0:13:19.340,0:13:25.660
the earthquake did. Heavy furniture lies where the quake had thrown them down and large cracks

0:13:25.700,0:13:28.240
may be seen even in the concrete floor

0:13:45.420,0:13:51.320
Families from the villages gather to meet the Emmanuel TV team and receive from them the much-needed food

0:13:51.320,0:13:58.140
and hygiene supplies provided as an expression of love and solidarity by TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV

0:13:58.140,0:14:03.600
partnerse.  Everybody from grandparents to grandchildren happily form a line as the

0:14:03.800,0:14:09.680
preparations are made for the distribution to begin from the chairs scattered around You can tell  they have been

0:14:10.040,0:14:15.560
expecting the arrival of the team with some excitement and are glad of the good news that

0:14:15.649,0:14:20.708
someone has been thinking about them, and that some relief has finally come .

0:14:21.529,0:14:25.599
The Emmanuel TV team sees it as a privilege to be in a position to help

0:14:26.060,0:14:33.360
Guided by the words of TB Joshua that "Giving is a real privilege if it is done in a proper attitude."

0:14:33.700,0:14:38.580
Those who are strong enough, take the boxes themselves with a heat and a smile

0:14:38.930,0:14:43.719
While the elderly or weaker members of the community are assisted by the volunteers

0:14:53.019,0:14:55.019
My son

0:15:03.780,0:15:05.780
Yes

0:15:12.429,0:15:14.429
 

0:15:17.860,0:15:24.860
The Grateful families express their thanks for the provisions, which will go a long way to meet their needs

0:15:24.860,0:15:27.120
in these trying times

0:15:27.120,0:15:32.360
The team takes a moment to explain to this elderly woman the contents of the box she's receiving

0:15:32.360,0:15:34.320
and she nods with satisfaction

0:15:34.420,0:15:40.020
The expression of their faces encourages those waiting on the line that it is well worth the wait

0:15:40.180,0:15:44.520
more and more families receive the food and hygiene gift boxes and

0:15:44.709,0:15:50.729
express both their surprise and thanks for both the gift freely given and the hearts behind it

0:16:44.420,0:16:49.479
 

0:16:49.940,0:16:57.580
 

0:16:58.580,0:17:04.869
 

0:17:06.350,0:17:11.320
 

0:17:11.990,0:17:16.599
 

0:17:17.150,0:17:20.200
 

0:17:20.720,0:17:22.370
 

0:17:22.370,0:17:26.140
 

0:17:27.320,0:17:32.259
 

0:17:34.490,0:17:36.880
 

0:17:38.330,0:17:40.330
 

0:17:41.420,0:17:46.659
 

0:19:37.180,0:19:43.360
Some families traveled quite a distance from the surrounding areas and hearing that the Emmanuel TV

0:19:43.360,0:19:45.760
earthquake relief team was coming,

0:19:45.760,0:19:51.080
Happily, they bought different vehicles able to return home with a degree of satisfaction

0:19:51.220,0:19:53.640
for their successful journey.

0:19:53.640,0:20:00.000
Others who live nearby take the stroll home proudly holding their gift boxes for all to see

0:20:00.380,0:20:03.040
and others wait in the shade for their transportation

0:20:03.040,0:20:11.040
It is amazing to see the impact a simple gift can bring.  For love is a language that transcends all boundaries

0:20:11.340,0:20:14.340
understood, by both young and old  alike

0:23:29.100,0:23:34.020
So the emmanual TV team has heard about the wonderful project which you're doing

0:23:34.020,0:23:43.920
to restart the economy here in the village of Chicapa de Castro by providing the port  oven liners

0:23:44.200,0:23:48.640
So that people can start to make the tortillas and earn a living again

0:23:48.640,0:23:59.760
so on behalf of TV Joshua and the emmanuel TV partners We'd like to sponsor 100 of these pottery oven

0:24:00.220,0:24:01.780
liners and It would it gives us great pleasure therefore to present you with thirty-five thousand pesos

0:24:05.120,0:24:12.140
it gives us great pleasure therefore to present you with thirty-five thousand pesos for the manufacture of the

0:24:12.200,0:24:14.800
oven liners and for the transport a

0:24:23.800,0:24:28.840
thank you for your help with all my heart. Emmanuel TV

0:24:39.320,0:24:41.920
The next port of call was Santa Maria del Mar

0:24:41.920,0:24:48.130
a secluded village community accessible only by wáter.  On the way to Santa Maria del Mar

0:24:48.130,0:24:54.999
the team traverse a rough track to the shoreline where the boats have been arranged to take the team across

0:24:55.220,0:25:01.449
to another area affected by the earthquake that have received little or no assistance at all

0:25:05.480,0:25:10.240
Just as Jesus Christ himself is the solution to the problems of all mankind,

0:25:10.240,0:25:14.880
so he expects us  to be a solution to someone in trouble

0:25:16.039,0:25:22.479
This is a coastal area of Oaxaca State known as El Faro

0:25:23.240,0:25:28.689
Where the boats come to take people to a very remote and isolated?

0:25:29.210,0:25:36.939
Village called Santa Maria. Del Mar and the Emmanuel TV team right now is preparing to take

0:25:37.760,0:25:43.539
boxes with food and hygiene provisions to this isolated community

0:25:51.849,0:25:53.968
The Emmanuel TV teams vehicle

0:25:54.360,0:26:01.220
reverses into a good position to allow the team to load the precious cargo of food and hygiene supplies

0:26:01.220,0:26:04.240
into the boat for transportation across the sea

0:26:04.240,0:26:10.440
Everybody lends a hand to get the scores of colourful boxes of much-needed supplies properly stowed

0:26:10.440,0:26:17.900
in the boats  The well-worn wooden slats make a good platform for wedging the boxes squarely into the boat

0:26:18.120,0:26:20.580
So that they won't topple over during the voyage

0:26:21.000,0:26:27.160
The Emmanuel TV team form a chain with the local fisherman to quickly pass the boxes into the boats

0:26:27.260,0:26:32.200
and as the saying goes "Many hands make light work."

0:26:42.440,0:26:48.220
When the boats loaded up they are covered in a thick green tarpaulin to protect the relief boxes

0:26:48.220,0:26:54.540
in their precious contents from the elements.  Finally fastening the whole thing securely with  strong ropes

0:26:54.540,0:26:58.200
The boats were ready to depart for Santa Maria del Mar.

0:26:58.200,0:27:03.200
A light rain began to fall as the team pushes off from the shore.

0:27:03.200,0:27:12.200
 

0:27:13.200,0:27:20.320
The fisherman navigate the beautiful, clear waters of the Pacific Ocean as we head to the remote village.

0:27:21.220,0:27:26.260
In different circumstances the surroundings could make for a perfect holiday getaway

0:27:26.800,0:27:32.060
But after the violence of the earthquake, the Isolation from the rest of the world

0:27:32.060,0:27:36.960
just makes help all the harder to come by

0:27:57.280,0:28:03.100
Traveling in tándem, the boats move as fast as the heavy load of cargo and passengers can permit.

0:28:03.380,0:28:09.420
To clear the vast expanse of water, the shore leading to the village comes into view on the horizon

0:28:09.720,0:28:13.660
and the boats reduce their speed as they near the land.

0:28:19.780,0:28:24.500
The expert fisherman maneuver the boats close to the shore to make a good approach

0:28:24.500,0:28:32.520
for a safe landing.  Largely untouched the rustic setting boasts of only a few boats moored nearby.

0:28:32.800,0:28:40.300
As the first boat pulls gently onto the shore the rain, which had been their companion over the sea softens

0:29:37.300,0:29:42.340
