0:00:00.000,0:00:05.500
Man of God, please help me! I was shot by an armed robber.

0:00:05.500,0:00:09.520
Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this man in the power of the Holy Ghost

0:00:09.520,0:00:13.160
and uproots whatever that is not of Jesus Christ in his life.

0:00:13.160,0:00:15.460
Glory be to God! He is free.

0:00:15.460,0:00:19.800
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:00:19.800,0:00:21.900
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:21.900,0:00:24.580
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:24.580,0:00:28.260
My name is Olufemi Daniel Olaegbe.

0:00:28.260,0:00:31.840
This woman by my side is my lovely wife.

0:00:31.840,0:00:39.000
I am here this morning to give thanks to the Almighty God, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:39.000,0:00:44.420
that delivered and rescued me from the valley of the shadow of death.

0:00:44.420,0:00:53.720
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a face injury due to gunshot by armed robbers.

0:00:53.720,0:01:00.080
When I was travelling, I ran into an armed robbers' ambush, unknowingly.

0:01:00.080,0:01:04.060
There was no way for me to escape.

0:01:04.060,0:01:07.820
I don't know how God managed to take me through them.

0:01:07.820,0:01:12.460
Before I knew it, after I had driven a little distance,

0:01:12.460,0:01:18.680
I saw blood coming out - something was just pouring on my body.

0:01:18.680,0:01:24.140
When I touched my face, I realised it was shattered.

0:01:24.140,0:01:31.440
I was touching my bone - pieces of my bone - the teeth and everything.

0:01:31.440,0:01:37.860
I just kept driving until I got to a checkpoint where I met police men.

0:01:37.860,0:01:44.700
When they saw me, they were so shocked by the nature of it.

0:01:44.700,0:01:49.040
They were the ones that rushed me to the hospital.

0:01:49.040,0:01:56.020
At the hospital, I underwent many treatments and surgeries.

0:01:56.020,0:02:01.080
But after everything, the pain was still there.

0:02:01.080,0:02:03.920
Nothing could enter my mouth.

0:02:03.920,0:02:06.260
My mouth could not even hold water.

0:02:06.260,0:02:10.260
If I put water in my mouth, everything would drain out from here.

0:02:10.260,0:02:14.880
I was so worried, "Is this how I will continue to live my life?"

0:02:14.880,0:02:19.120
But I remembered that I used to watch Emmanuel TV.

0:02:19.120,0:02:24.700
I have seen a lot of things being done by Prophet T.B. Joshua in the life of people.

0:02:24.700,0:02:30.900
I summoned courage and decided to come to The SCOAN.

0:02:30.900,0:02:38.340
When I came to The SCOAN, I was opportune to be at the prayer line.

0:02:38.340,0:02:41.340
The man of God laid his hand on me.

0:02:41.340,0:02:43.235
You see that hand?

0:02:43.240,0:02:56.720
When he tapped me, I felt like my shattered jaw bone was being arranged.

0:02:56.720,0:03:02.720
Healed Of Face Injury
Due To Gunshot

0:03:02.720,0:03:08.820
I felt as if nothing had happened to me before.

0:03:08.820,0:03:11.220
I instantly felt alright.

0:03:11.220,0:03:18.120
When I got home after the healing, I felt hungry.

0:03:18.120,0:03:24.300
Whereas, I could not take anything apart from water during the time I had the problem.

0:03:24.300,0:03:27.040
But when I got home on that day, I ate.

0:03:27.040,0:03:32.460
I was surprised that I could use the jaw; the teeth could come together again.

0:03:32.460,0:03:35.440
I could eat, bite, and do everything.

0:03:35.440,0:03:40.780
Healed Of Face Injury
Due To Gunshot

0:03:40.780,0:03:47.860
Since then, up 'till this present time, I feel stronger and stronger every day.

0:03:47.860,0:03:51.460
As you see me now standing, I am 50 years old now

0:03:51.460,0:03:55.380
but I have the strength of a 25 years old boy within me.

0:03:55.380,0:03:57.960
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:03:57.960,0:04:03.160
I said, put your hands together louder for the miracle-working God!

0:04:03.160,0:04:05.780
We give glory to God Almighty. Our brother said it all.

0:04:05.780,0:04:13.740
He said his jaw bones were shattered because of the gunshot he received at the armed robbers' attack.

0:04:13.740,0:04:16.780
But today, we just want to have a look at that same jaw.

0:04:16.780,0:04:18.760
Can we have a look?

0:04:18.760,0:04:21.755
Tell us how you are feeling as you are touching it. Do you feel any pain?

0:04:21.760,0:04:22.880
I am free.

0:04:22.880,0:04:25.580
You can see, I can touch it.

0:04:25.580,0:04:29.500
Everything is okay, there is no pain.

0:04:29.500,0:04:31.240
I feel fine.

0:04:31.240,0:04:36.120
Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together once again for Jesus!

0:04:36.120,0:04:40.360
Explain to us the pictures we are seeing on the board next to you.

0:04:40.360,0:04:43.560
Who exactly is on the pictures we are seeing?

0:04:43.560,0:04:47.000
This is me when I was at the hospital.

0:04:47.000,0:04:52.740
It was the doctors on duty that took these pictures to send to the surgeon

0:04:52.740,0:04:56.540
that they have a very severe case at hand.

0:04:56.540,0:05:01.100
Those are the pictures taken by the doctors in the first night at the hospital.

0:05:01.100,0:05:03.320
But after the prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:05:03.320,0:05:07.040
what happened to that wound we are seeing on that picture?

0:05:07.040,0:05:11.160
After the prayer from the man of God, the wound healed.

0:05:11.160,0:05:21.380
The doctors told me that the vein that comes from here and connects to the brain cut

0:05:21.380,0:05:25.240
and they could not join it together.

0:05:25.240,0:05:28.080
The doctors then said that even if everything gets better,

0:05:28.080,0:05:31.820
there will be a drain where water will be coming out from this place.

0:05:31.820,0:05:36.840
And that I should bear in mind that that is how I am going to be living.

0:05:36.840,0:05:41.700
But after the prayer of the man of God, everything miraculously covered up.

0:05:41.700,0:05:45.000
When they saw me back at the hospital, they were asking me about it.

0:05:45.000,0:05:47.540
They said that I am a very lucky man.

0:05:47.540,0:05:50.120
As you can see now, I am fine. Everything is okay now.

0:05:50.120,0:05:52.620
We thank God Almighty because our God is a God of possibilities.

0:05:52.620,0:05:55.700
What is impossible to man is very very possible to God.

0:05:55.700,0:05:59.240
God Almighty has proven to us once again that the age of miracles has not passed.

0:05:59.240,0:06:02.620
The Miracle Worker is still alive and His name is Jesus.

0:06:02.620,0:06:05.960
If you know that, put your hands together once again for Jesus!

0:06:05.960,0:06:07.340
We give glory to God Almighty.

0:06:07.340,0:06:09.540
Good Morning, Church!

0:06:09.540,0:06:12.920
My name is Mrs Olaegbe.

0:06:12.920,0:06:14.740
My husband has said it all.

0:06:14.740,0:06:21.360
But I just want to give glory to God for saving him from death.

0:06:21.360,0:06:22.840
I couldn't believe it.

0:06:22.840,0:06:25.840
When I saw him in the hospital, it was terrible.

0:06:25.840,0:06:28.340
But I give all glory to God. Hallelujah!

0:06:28.340,0:06:31.300
Hallelujah! We give glory to God Almighty.

0:06:31.300,0:06:35.900
Viewers listening and watching me all over the world,

0:06:35.900,0:06:37.980
I want you to have faith.

0:06:37.980,0:06:40.940
Just as the man of God used to say.

0:06:40.940,0:06:48.280
Have faith in God, depend on God alone, and He will see you through.

0:06:48.280,0:06:50.740
Hallelujah! We know that with faith, all things are possible.

0:06:50.740,0:06:53.540
We give glory to God and we thank you for that wonderful word of advice.

0:06:53.540,0:06:55.220
We equally want to advise you as well

0:06:55.220,0:06:58.860
that God Almighty has healed you completely for the salvation of your soul.

0:06:58.860,0:07:03.060
So make sure you continue to follow Him along the way, making His Word the standard for your life

0:07:03.060,0:07:06.740
and His Word will continue to set you on the good road to the good life.

0:07:06.740,0:07:09.400
Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:07:09.400,0:07:09.900
