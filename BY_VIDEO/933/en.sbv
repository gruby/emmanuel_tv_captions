During one of the Sunday services at The SCOAN,

0:00:04.280,0:00:09.820
the evangelists are sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to move in the midst of the congregation

0:00:09.820,0:00:14.320
and minister the Morning Water in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:14.320,0:00:20.660
Remember, the Bible says in the book of Acts 19, that anything that had come into contact

0:00:20.660,0:00:24.980
with Apostle Paul was taken to the afflicted and the oppressed

0:00:24.980,0:00:28.280
and they received healing and deliverance.

0:00:28.280,0:00:31.460
As it was, so it is.

0:00:31.460,0:00:35.180
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:00:35.180,0:00:41.095
And He can use any medium to express Himself and His mission to others.

0:00:41.100,0:00:45.380
As this instrument of God's power descends upon the people,

0:00:45.380,0:00:49.320
the reaction is as instant as it is awesome.

0:00:49.320,0:00:50.920
Darkness flees.

0:00:50.920,0:00:58.260
Unclean spirits are exposed and people are restored to the original position in which God created them.

0:00:58.260,0:01:02.800
Total liberty of spirit, soul and body.

0:01:02.800,0:01:09.340
Among the congregants is this lady who immediately looses control of her faculties

0:01:09.340,0:01:11.800
as the Morning Water is ministered.

0:01:11.800,0:01:15.240
Let's watch the spiritual battle that follows.

0:01:15.240,0:01:18.320
Now speak! Who are you in this body?

0:01:18.320,0:01:20.840
Speak! Who are you in this body, you demon?

0:01:20.840,0:01:22.360
Who are you in this body?

0:01:22.360,0:01:29.800
Leave me alone!

0:01:29.800,0:01:31.620
Speak out! Who are you in this body?

0:01:31.620,0:01:34.020
Leave me alone!

0:01:34.020,0:01:37.140
In the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ, you have no choice.

0:01:37.140,0:01:39.720
And you can't resist this - this is the power of God.

0:01:39.720,0:01:43.080
Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ! Who are you in this body?

0:01:43.080,0:01:47.920
I am a queen.

0:01:47.920,0:01:50.380
As a queen, what have you done to her?

0:01:50.380,0:01:56.360
I am the queen of this body.

0:01:56.360,0:02:05.980
I destroyed everything around and inside her.

0:02:05.980,0:02:10.060
Speak in the name of Jesus Christ! What have you destroyed?

0:02:10.060,0:02:15.440
Name what you have destroyed, you demon.

0:02:15.440,0:02:30.680
I destroyed her health.

0:02:30.680,0:02:33.460
You have destroyed her health. Mention the sickness you have given her.

0:02:33.460,0:02:37.520
She has no faith in your God.

0:02:37.520,0:02:39.060
Speak, in the name of Jesus' Christ.

0:02:39.060,0:02:44.960
She has no faith in your God.

0:02:44.960,0:02:49.400
She is unhappy; I destroyed everything in her life.

0:02:49.400,0:03:08.920
I destroyed her marriage and will make her divorce.

0:03:08.920,0:03:20.880
She will be unhappy until the end of her life.

0:03:20.880,0:03:22.240
Now, listen to this!

0:03:22.240,0:03:25.500
You demon, speak! Mention what you have done to her marriage.

0:03:25.500,0:03:27.600
Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:03:27.600,0:03:30.100
What have you done to her marriage?

0:03:30.100,0:03:40.400
I irritate him all the time.

0:03:40.400,0:03:43.260
Who is this man standing beside you? Who is he? Speak!

0:03:43.260,0:03:47.080
This is her husband.

0:03:47.080,0:03:48.700
Ok, this is her husband.

0:03:48.700,0:03:54.140
Mention what you have done to her marriage.

0:03:54.140,0:03:58.800
I want them to divorce.

0:03:58.800,0:04:04.000
You want them to divorce. Now explain - what are the things you have made her to do?

0:04:04.000,0:04:06.900
What have you caused this woman to do in her marriage? Explain.

0:04:06.900,0:04:19.000
I have many powers; I can make people worship me.

0:04:19.000,0:04:24.280
What else have you done to her family?

0:04:24.280,0:04:27.000
What else have you done to her?

0:04:27.000,0:04:29.300
Apart from her marital life, what else have you done to her?

0:04:29.300,0:04:45.500
I told you she is unhappy. Her mother and sister are unhappy; she will be unhappy all her life.

0:04:45.500,0:04:57.120
He irritates me because he prays all the time.

0:04:57.120,0:04:59.000
Who made her to be depressed?

0:04:59.000,0:05:04.300
And what do you want her to do because of her unhappiness?

0:05:04.300,0:05:14.000
She only thinks about her illnesses.

0:05:14.000,0:05:17.060
What do you want her to do due to her unhappiness and depression?

0:05:17.060,0:05:21.580
What do you want her to do, you demon? Speak!

0:05:21.580,0:05:30.600
I want to separate them so that she can do whatever I want.

0:05:30.600,0:05:32.740
It is painful for me.

0:05:32.740,0:05:35.180
You are welcome, sir. Who is she to you?

0:05:35.180,0:05:37.980
She is my wife.

0:05:37.980,0:05:40.540
Can you tell us what you can say about your wife?

0:05:40.540,0:05:43.820
She has mentioned that the demon wants both of you to be separated.

0:05:43.820,0:05:45.480
What can you say about that?

0:05:45.480,0:05:51.480
Yes, the demon always makes her irritate me.

0:05:51.480,0:05:59.360
It tries to make us always unhappy and have a confrontation.

0:05:59.360,0:06:08.600
Tell us about her character, how she behaves at home, and how she causes trouble.

0:06:08.600,0:06:18.160
She can't pray or read anything spiritual. Her spiritual life is zero.

0:06:18.160,0:06:24.200
She can't do anything in terms of praying and believing.

0:06:24.200,0:06:27.320
She mentioned that this demon caused her to be unhappy

0:06:27.320,0:06:31.040
and caused everybody in the house to be sad. What can you say about that?

0:06:31.040,0:06:43.320
The demon tries to make her aggressive and depressed.

0:06:43.320,0:06:47.440
Who caused her depression? Who made her to be depressed?

0:06:47.440,0:06:54.280
Speak, in the name of Jesus' Christ! Who made her to be depressed?

0:06:54.280,0:06:58.820
I caused it. I can cause it to anyone here.

0:06:58.820,0:07:02.660
What else have you done to her?

0:07:02.660,0:07:12.000
She will be alone and she will never have children.

0:07:12.000,0:07:15.880
How did you enter her?

0:07:15.880,0:07:24.740
When she was born, I was there. I'm from generations.

0:07:24.740,0:07:30.780
By the special grace of God, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent this Morning Water

0:07:30.780,0:07:35.540
to deliver you and today is the end.

0:07:35.540,0:07:38.380
Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:38.380,0:07:42.820
Your time has expired in this body and today is the last day.

0:07:42.820,0:07:44.220
You have to leave.

0:07:44.220,0:07:47.080
Come here!

0:07:47.080,0:07:49.360
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:07:49.360,0:07:51.300
Out of this body, in the name of Jesus!

0:07:51.300,0:07:52.540
Out of this body!

0:07:52.540,0:07:58.960
Out!

0:07:58.960,0:08:09.340
Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:09.340,0:08:10.460
Out of this body!

0:08:10.460,0:08:15.140
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:15.140,0:08:17.820
I hate you!

0:08:17.820,0:08:19.580
You have no choice.

0:08:19.580,0:08:25.220
The power of God is more than you. Jesus owns all authority.

0:08:25.220,0:08:27.780
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:27.780,0:08:32.700
Out!

0:08:32.700,0:08:34.500
Out of her!

0:08:34.500,0:08:37.500
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:37.500,0:08:39.920
Come here!

0:08:39.920,0:08:47.440
I have lived here for centuries. Do you want me to come out?

0:08:47.440,0:08:52.940
No matter how long you have been in this body, you demon, today is your end.

0:08:52.940,0:08:56.880
You have to leave this body and go to the pit of hell.

0:08:56.880,0:08:59.900
Now, Jesus wants you to leave. Out of this body!

0:08:59.900,0:09:04.920
Out!

0:09:04.920,0:09:06.920
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:09:06.920,0:09:10.100
In Jesus' mighty name we pray.

0:09:10.100,0:09:12.600
Thank You, Jesus, for her deliverance.

0:09:12.600,0:09:15.020
In Jesus' name. You are free.

0:09:15.020,0:09:25.180
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:09:25.180,0:09:28.920
Stand up, Madam, you are free in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:09:28.920,0:09:33.960
through the medium of the Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:09:33.960,0:09:36.480
You are free in Jesus' name.

0:09:36.480,0:09:47.860
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:09:47.860,0:09:50.720
Thank You, Jesus, we are free. Thank You, Jesus.

0:09:50.720,0:09:54.340
So who is this man standing beside you?

0:09:54.340,0:09:57.800
He is my husband.

0:09:57.800,0:10:05.280
Now Jesus Christ has set you free through the medium of the Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:10:05.280,0:10:10.620
and today Jesus Christ has declared you free. Continue to walk in the light of your testimony.

0:10:10.620,0:10:15.700
Sir, whatever she has said today, please do not remind her of her past.

0:10:15.700,0:10:21.360
Her past is over and you continue to live for Christ Jesus from now henceforth, in Jesus' name.

0:10:21.360,0:10:23.060
Thank You, Jesus.

0:10:23.060,0:10:35.020
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:10:35.020,0:10:38.500
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:10:43.240,0:10:50.320
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Kazakhstan

0:10:50.320,0:10:59.340
Good morning, Church. Her name is Elmira, we came from Kazakhstan and I am her husband.

0:10:59.340,0:11:03.500
Tell us your testimony.

0:11:03.500,0:11:27.760
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Deliverance Testimony

0:11:27.760,0:11:33.500
When we got married, we noticed that she had the spirit of anger

0:11:33.500,0:11:37.460
and we understood that we needed to do something about it.

0:11:37.460,0:11:45.920
So we went to different churches to get this deliverance but there was no help.

0:11:45.920,0:11:50.120
We have heard it from the woman that the problem that brought her to The SCOAN

0:11:50.120,0:11:54.460
was that she was possessed with a demon that caused her a terrible spirit of anger.

0:11:54.460,0:11:57.900
She has been to several places and churches for deliverance all to no avail.

0:11:57.900,0:12:02.540
They both deemed it necessary to visit The SCOAN for her deliverance.

0:12:02.540,0:12:08.420
Tell us how this spirit of anger affected your life, your marriage and everything that has to do with you,

0:12:08.420,0:12:10.540
before you came for deliverance.

0:12:10.540,0:12:54.260
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Deliverance Testimony

0:12:54.260,0:13:03.480
She said that we had a normal family, no problems with money, shelter, job,

0:13:03.480,0:13:09.960
but she felt very disturbed, caring a lot about different things.

0:13:09.960,0:13:16.420
She would become angry because of small things that were happening not the way she wanted them to.

0:13:16.420,0:13:20.340
She wanted everything to be her way.

0:13:20.340,0:13:21.820
We have heard it from the husband.

0:13:21.820,0:13:27.340
He explained that the spirit of anger affected the marriage in the sense that

0:13:27.340,0:13:32.920
she got angry at every little thing and she always wanted her own will to supersede his,

0:13:32.920,0:13:36.060
until they finally came to The SCOAN for deliverance.

0:13:36.060,0:13:40.620
Tell us how you come to know about The SCOAN.

0:13:40.620,0:14:00.920
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Deliverance Testimony

0:14:00.920,0:14:06.060
She said that after we recognised the problem, we started to search for help

0:14:06.060,0:14:15.460
and we saw a video on YouTube where there was deliverance in The SCOAN

0:14:15.460,0:14:22.900
and I as her husband started to pray and to prepare, since the beginning of the year to come here.

0:14:22.900,0:14:27.800
Because of the terrible problem of this spirit of anger, they started looking for a solution.

0:14:27.800,0:14:30.960
That was how they went on the internet and as God would have it,

0:14:30.960,0:14:32.880
they came across Emmanuel TV.

0:14:32.880,0:14:38.500
That's how both of them came together and decided to visit The SCOAN for her deliverance.

0:14:38.500,0:14:43.420
Tell us what happened last Sunday when the evangelist ministered the Morning Water on you.

0:14:43.420,0:15:14.740
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Deliverance Testimony

0:15:14.740,0:15:21.380
When the Morning Water ministration started, she looked around and saw many people

0:15:21.380,0:15:27.360
who were to minister the Morning Water and she began to worry.

0:15:27.360,0:15:32.420
After the evangelist started ministering the Morning Water on her,

0:15:32.420,0:15:42.520
she doesn't remember from that moment what was happening. She couldn't understand it.

0:15:42.520,0:15:48.540
She could understand everything in her mind but she could not control her speech and actions.

0:15:48.540,0:15:51.580
You have heard the husband interpret what she rightly said.

0:15:51.580,0:15:54.080
While the evangelist was ministering the Morning Water,

0:15:54.080,0:15:59.020
before the evangelist got to where she was, she started feeling worried and uncomfortable.

0:15:59.020,0:16:04.420
The moment the evangelist ministered  the Morning Water on her, she lost consciousness of herself.

0:16:04.420,0:16:07.700
At the end of the day, she found herself being delivered.

0:16:07.700,0:16:10.480
Tell us, ever since you have been delivered,

0:16:10.480,0:16:13.120
what are the changes you have seen in your life, to really confirm

0:16:13.120,0:16:15.780
that the spirit of anger has left you completely.

0:16:15.780,0:17:03.100
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Deliverance Testimony

0:17:03.100,0:17:14.900
She said that since the deliverance, she feels calm and peaceful. She has peace inside her.

0:17:14.900,0:17:23.040
She trusts God, she trusts me as her husband and she has no urge to be in control.

0:17:23.040,0:17:33.980
Before, she had a problem with belief because the spirit always tried to make her focus on her problems.

0:17:33.980,0:17:37.580
She could not read and grow in her faith.

0:17:37.580,0:17:43.800
But now, she feels stronger spiritually.

0:17:43.800,0:17:45.340
To God be the glory.

0:17:45.340,0:17:46.880
You have heard the husband.

0:17:46.880,0:17:52.540
She said that ever since the deliverance took place,

0:17:52.540,0:17:56.720
she has seen tremendous changes in her life and also in her marriage.

0:17:56.720,0:18:00.940
She is no longer authoritative in her marriage, she no longer wants her will to supersede that of her husband,

0:18:00.940,0:18:05.320
she is very calm now and does not see herself getting angry at every little thing.

0:18:05.320,0:18:09.760
She said the area that baffled her most was that before her deliverance,

0:18:09.760,0:18:14.800
each time she wanted to read the Word of God, she would find herself thinking about her past.

0:18:14.800,0:18:16.880
For that reason, she would lose concentration.

0:18:16.880,0:18:20.100
But after the deliverance, she developed love for the Word of God,

0:18:20.100,0:18:22.280
she can read and fully concentrate.

0:18:22.280,0:18:26.040
She is giving thanks to God Almighty for restoring her concentration to the will of God.

0:18:26.040,0:18:32.200
Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:18:32.200,0:18:37.160
Finally, what word of advice do you have for those who are listening to you around the world?

0:18:37.160,0:19:11.020
Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
Deliverance Testimony

0:19:11.020,0:19:18.860
She said that if you feel disappointed or have some doubts about God's power,

0:19:18.860,0:19:22.180
just belief in God, stay faithful to Him.

0:19:22.180,0:19:28.580
Wherever you are does not matter. Just belief in God and you will see His glory.

0:19:28.580,0:19:30.600
To God be the glory. You have heard it all.

0:19:30.600,0:19:34.960
That if you feel disappointed and belief that the power of God does not exist,

0:19:34.960,0:19:37.860
all you need to do is to belief and trust in Him

0:19:37.860,0:19:42.220
because God is powerful and faithful to those who are faithful to Him as well.

0:19:42.220,0:19:48.400
Let's put our hands together beautifully for that!

0:19:48.400,0:19:51.860
Sir, could you introduce yourself to us? Who are you to her?

0:19:51.860,0:19:56.020
My name is Igor Pak. I am her husband.

0:19:56.020,0:20:02.220
What do you have to say about her testimony?

0:20:02.220,0:20:09.140
Actually it is true because sometimes I would notice that her faith was weak.

0:20:09.140,0:20:12.580
She could not read the Word, she could not pray,

0:20:12.580,0:20:17.760
she was always disturbed about some other things beside God.

0:20:17.760,0:20:20.700
Now I see that her character has changed.

0:20:20.700,0:20:22.500
You mean after her deliverance?

0:20:22.500,0:20:29.140
After the deliverance, I can see that she has changed, she has peace,

0:20:29.140,0:20:33.220
and she is not disturbed all the time.

0:20:33.220,0:20:38.160
You have heard the husband testifying to the goodness of the Lord in the life of his wife after her deliverance.

0:20:38.160,0:20:43.880
Prior to her deliverance, he could see that the wife had lost total concentration concerning the things of God,

0:20:43.880,0:20:46.480
she didn't read her Bible and she didn't talk about God

0:20:46.480,0:20:49.420
because of that terrible spirit of anger that almost destroyed her life.

0:20:49.420,0:20:52.740
But he is giving glory to God Almighty that after the wife has been delivered,

0:20:52.740,0:20:55.860
he has witnessed numerous changes in her life.

0:20:55.860,0:20:58.820
Right now, she can read the Word of God with full concentration.

0:20:58.820,0:21:02.280
She has peace in her heart and the family is united once again.

0:21:02.280,0:21:07.660
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ for that!

0:21:07.660,0:21:10.960
As the husband, what word of advice do you have?

0:21:10.980,0:21:20.240
My advice to husbands is that you should not panic.

0:21:20.240,0:21:22.880
Trust in God. He is faithful.

0:21:22.880,0:21:29.620
Prayers are always heard by God and He is prepare the answer for you. Glory be to God.

0:21:29.620,0:21:34.055
Amen! In other words, prayers for many years are not lost,

0:21:34.060,0:21:38.360
they are issuing themselves out in glory, slowly but surely.

0:21:38.360,0:21:42.320
Don't lose your faith in God, put your faith in God and trust in Him alone.

0:21:42.320,0:21:45.320
For He alone can surprise you in every situation.

0:21:45.320,0:21:47.380
To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for your lives

0:21:47.380,0:21:49.955
and we also rejoice with you for this wonderful transformation.

0:21:49.960,0:21:53.440
We want to advise you by saying that you should make the Word of God the standard for your lives

0:21:53.440,0:21:56.160
so that your deliverance will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:21:56.160,0:21:58.280
Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
