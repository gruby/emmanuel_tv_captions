0:00:00.000,0:00:07.240
Viewers all over the world, whatever medium you are using to watch this service, I say, stay blessed.

0:00:07.240,0:00:08.740
[Amen.]

0:00:08.740,0:00:16.000
I am taking you to the book of Ephesians 3:17.

0:00:16.000,0:00:25.420
"Then Christ will make his home in your hearts."

0:00:25.420,0:00:28.580
Christ will make his home in your what?

0:00:28.580,0:00:29.480
[Heart.]

0:00:29.480,0:00:31.180
In your heart.

0:00:31.180,0:00:36.820
This means, that is the place Christ dwells.

0:00:36.820,0:00:38.800
That is the residence.

0:00:38.800,0:00:50.360
Many times we hear the song, "Inner my heart, Lord, I want to be like Jesus, inner my heart."

0:00:50.360,0:00:57.800
In our hearts, we want to be like Jesus, not in our face.

0:00:57.800,0:01:04.920
Here it says, "Christ will make his home in your hearts".

0:01:04.920,0:01:13.340
Our heart is the communication point – a dwelling place for Christ.

0:01:13.340,0:01:15.620
A contact.

0:01:15.620,0:01:21.400
If you are to hear from Christ, it is through your heart, not your ears.

0:01:21.400,0:01:26.700
Many would say, "Jesus, what are You saying?"

0:01:26.700,0:01:32.400
You can't hear Christ through your ears but your heart.

0:01:32.400,0:01:39.420
This makes it possible for us to talk to you and at the same time, to Christ

0:01:39.420,0:01:43.100
because we are not using the same medium.

0:01:43.100,0:01:47.760
I will use my mouth to talk to you and I will use my heart to talk to Jesus.

0:01:47.760,0:01:54.020
Jesus also will talk to me and at the same time, a man can talk to me

0:01:54.020,0:01:57.900
because it’s not the same medium.

0:01:57.900,0:02:04.480
If someone is telling you, "Look, I'm praying, don't disturb me" - I question his spirituality.

0:02:04.480,0:02:09.780
You can be talking to me and at the same time, I pray to Jesus.

0:02:09.780,0:02:13.720
We are not using the same medium.

0:02:13.720,0:02:16.940
As I am talking to you now, I am talking to Jesus.

0:02:16.940,0:02:21.460
Jesus is talking to me and I am talking to you at the same time.

0:02:21.460,0:02:28.280
I am praying and at the same time, I am talking to you because I'm not using the same medium.

0:02:28.280,0:02:30.020
Hallelujah.

0:02:30.020,0:02:41.720
OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION

0:02:41.720,0:02:46.080
That is the topic this message.

0:02:46.080,0:02:47.700
Hallelujah.

0:02:47.700,0:02:57.180
“… as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong."

0:02:57.180,0:02:58.660
Wow.

0:02:58.660,0:03:05.820
Christ will make your heart a dwelling place.

0:03:05.820,0:03:12.580
A dwelling place – a place of living – your heart.

0:03:12.580,0:03:16.980
Faith is of man’s heart.

0:03:16.980,0:03:23.580
Anywhere in the Bible that refers to heart, refers to the spirit.

0:03:23.580,0:03:27.840
Man’s heart and man’s spirit are the same.

0:03:27.840,0:03:31.460
Don't get confused.

0:03:31.460,0:03:38.760
Faith is of man’s heart, not of man’s body, flesh.

0:03:38.760,0:03:43.280
Only faith pleases God.

0:03:43.280,0:03:51.660
The Word of God builds Christ’s nature into us.

0:03:51.660,0:03:54.520
What builds Christ's nature?

0:03:54.520,0:04:03.120
The Word of God builds Christ’s nature into us, that is building Christ's nature into individuals.

0:04:03.120,0:04:06.960
When you want to end your letter as a Christian, you say, "In Him".

0:04:06.960,0:04:13.760
When your are writing a letter to a friend or... in the end you say, "In Him".

0:04:13.760,0:04:20.700
That is; in Him I live, move, talk – do all.

0:04:20.700,0:04:27.260
The Word builds Christ’s nature into us.

0:04:27.260,0:04:43.660
In other words, God is building Himself into us, making Himself a part of us

0:04:43.660,0:04:52.620
as the Word dominates, take note of that; building Himself into us

0:04:52.620,0:05:02.420
as the Word dominates, rules and satisfies our spirit nature.

0:05:02.420,0:05:14.020
This means faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.

0:05:14.020,0:05:17.040
Faith is perfected by our what?

0:05:17.040,0:05:18.240
[Acting on the Word.]

0:05:18.240,0:05:20.480
That is?

0:05:20.480,0:05:25.460
The Word must dominate us.

0:05:25.460,0:05:28.900
The Word must live in us.

0:05:28.900,0:05:31.940
This is the secret of faith.

0:05:31.940,0:05:47.600
We say; faith is perfected by our acting - it means; Word must dominate us, live in us...

0:05:47.600,0:05:50.080
This is the secret of faith.

0:05:50.080,0:05:58.840
If the Word has not dominated you, you cannot act faith.

0:05:58.840,0:06:11.720
The Word must dominate you, live in you – this is the secret of faith.

0:06:11.720,0:06:22.220
You can easily know a man of faith by a mere looking at his attitude.

0:06:22.220,0:06:28.240
Faith is not imitation – it cannot me imitated.

0:06:28.240,0:06:34.600
When you see a man "copying" people, imitating...

0:06:34.600,0:06:38.720
Faith is not imitation – it cannot me imitated.

0:06:38.720,0:06:46.660
When you look around you say, "I like that style of a haircut. When I leave here, I am going to do the same.

0:06:46.660,0:06:51.960
Look at the suit this man wears - I am going to buy the same."

0:06:51.960,0:07:00.720
You keep comparing yourself to others; you are not content.

0:07:00.720,0:07:05.580
Faith is not imitation – it cannot by imitated.

0:07:05.580,0:07:17.040
It must arise in each person’s heart based on the Word of God because faith is of man's heart.

0:07:17.040,0:07:27.020
It must arise in each person’s heart according to the Word of God.

0:07:27.020,0:07:30.920
Because faith is of man’s heart.

0:07:30.920,0:07:32.800
That is faith.

0:07:32.800,0:07:38.300
When you see a man of faith, he doesn’t copy.

0:07:38.300,0:07:42.840
Follow the majority - no.

0:07:42.840,0:07:45.840
He does according to his heart.

0:07:45.840,0:07:48.140
He speaks according to his heart.

0:07:48.140,0:07:54.820
He doesn't look at the people's appearance; "this man is light in complexion - I'm going to bleach my body.

0:07:54.820,0:08:01.120
This man is slim - I'm going to do exercises to get slim.

0:08:01.120,0:08:09.340
This man has a very long hair - I'm going to tie something to my hair to get it long."

0:08:09.340,0:08:11.280
Faith does not neglect.

0:08:11.280,0:08:16.640
It does not neglect responsibilities.

0:08:16.640,0:08:18.280
Are your with me?

0:08:18.280,0:08:24.400
Faith does not neglect.

0:08:24.400,0:08:30.480
It does not neglect responsibilities.

0:08:30.480,0:08:44.580
You see a man of faith - this is a man who recognized his responsibilities.

0:08:44.580,0:08:50.440
It is easy to know the man of faith - it is simple, regardless of what they say

0:08:50.440,0:08:58.600
by mere looking at this formula you will able to know; "hey, it is not a man of faith".

0:08:58.600,0:09:11.480
Faith is not a panic button to push.

0:09:11.480,0:09:19.420
Oh, sorry, sorry, I have not fastened that button, please camera...

0:09:19.420,0:09:26.540
It is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.

0:09:26.540,0:09:31.700
Today, you see Christians coming to God when they are in trouble; running to church for healing, praying,

0:09:31.700,0:09:40.280
reading the Bible - Psalm 35, putting it under the pillow, on the stomach...

0:09:40.280,0:09:43.060
They have nightmares - they run from place to place.

0:09:43.060,0:09:49.920
But when the going is smooth - you would not see them.

0:09:49.920,0:10:04.320
Faith is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.

0:10:04.320,0:10:10.860
It is a lifestyle of trusting in God.

0:10:10.860,0:10:20.240
Faith is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.

0:10:20.240,0:10:23.300
In the time of trouble they will say, "I rebuke in the name of..."

0:10:23.300,0:10:28.720
When you see people in trouble they will go for fasting of 3-4 days because they are in trouble.

0:10:28.720,0:10:31.620
That is not a man of faith.

0:10:31.620,0:10:41.460
Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.

0:10:41.460,0:10:52.040
When the going is good you see them praying, fasting - they do the same when the going is hard.

0:10:52.040,0:10:59.800
Faith is not a denial – it does not deny the existence of a problem.

0:10:59.800,0:11:08.240
When you are sick, you say, "I am sick" because they know that a man can be sick and yet be a friend of God.

0:11:08.240,0:11:14.340
Today, you learn that many ministers of God died suddenly - they have been sick for a long time

0:11:14.340,0:11:17.180
but they didn't want people to know that they were sick.

0:11:17.180,0:11:22.700
They were afraid that people would think the the sickness is a result of their sin.

0:11:22.700,0:11:26.240
So, they die suddenly.

0:11:26.240,0:11:30.780
Some of them commit suicide - ministers of God...

0:11:30.780,0:11:40.320
Faith is not a denial – it does not deny the existence of a problem.

0:11:40.320,0:11:42.480
We are still talking about faith.

0:11:42.480,0:11:44.840
The question - how come about faith?

0:11:44.840,0:11:46.700
Where can I get faith?

0:11:46.700,0:11:48.380
Where is the faith?

0:11:48.380,0:11:51.600
It does not originate from us.

0:11:51.600,0:12:00.340
If faith originates from saints, it would be fragile, weak.

0:12:00.340,0:12:04.160
I am talking of saints - s a i n t.

0:12:04.160,0:12:06.000
If faith originates from saints...

0:12:06.000,0:12:07.900
Not even you - you are not a saint.

0:12:07.900,0:12:15.340
Saint Apostles; if faith originates from them - it would be fragile, weak.

0:12:15.340,0:12:17.960
Faith originates from God.

0:12:17.960,0:12:23.360
This is why you must pay attention to God.

0:12:23.360,0:12:25.720
This is why you must pay attention to whom?

0:12:25.720,0:12:27.860
[God.]

0:12:27.860,0:12:32.200
What do I mean by 'pay attention to God'?

0:12:32.200,0:12:43.100
Look to God, look at God, meditate on God – you will have faith.

0:12:43.100,0:12:50.360
The more you look to God, look at God, meditate on God, the more you will have faith.

0:12:50.360,0:12:55.060
It comes spontaneously, naturally.

0:12:55.060,0:12:59.700
This is why you see many great ministers today who never attended any theology school.

0:12:59.700,0:13:04.380
This is why you see the rustic boy being raised as a great apostle today.

0:13:04.380,0:13:08.400
This is why you see a farmer or a fisherman becoming a great apostle -

0:13:08.400,0:13:11.340
without education, not being able to read a letter.

0:13:11.340,0:13:15.020
You will be surprised that he is not educated. 
How come?

0:13:15.020,0:13:21.340
How somebody not educated can manage to be a great apostle and to preach the Word? - No

0:13:21.340,0:13:28.960
If faith originates in you; no illiterate would be raised, no rustic boy or fisherman

0:13:28.960,0:13:31.400
would become a great apostle.

0:13:31.400,0:13:34.620
If faith originates in you.

0:13:34.620,0:13:39.000
You would begin to look for a professor to anoint you.

0:13:39.000,0:13:46.920
You would begin to look for personalities, rich, great famous people to anoint you.

0:13:46.920,0:13:48.980
If faith originates in you.

0:13:48.980,0:13:52.900
This is why faith does not originate in you, it originates in God.

0:13:52.900,0:13:57.360
This is the area we Christians neglect today.

0:13:57.360,0:14:04.760
As a result of this our conversion becomes questionable.

0:14:04.760,0:14:07.620
You can know if your conversion is questionable.

0:14:07.620,0:14:12.200
When you cannot act with God and know God's opinion about yourself and others,

0:14:12.200,0:14:14.960
it means your conversion is questionable.

0:14:14.960,0:14:22.040
You may know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation - yet; something is missing.

0:14:22.040,0:14:23.680
What is missing?

0:14:23.680,0:14:25.300
No.

0:14:25.300,0:14:30.020
You may have faith but not enough.

0:14:30.020,0:14:35.460
The father of the demon-possessed boy came to Jesus saying, "I have brought my son to Your disciples,

0:14:35.460,0:14:38.880
they could not have delivered him because they had no power".

0:14:38.880,0:14:49.160
Jesus said, "No. They had power. Their faith was not adequate to release that power they needed."

0:14:49.160,0:14:52.740
Faith is a Heavenly currency.

0:14:52.740,0:14:59.800
The little currency you have is the little Heavenly material you can buy -

0:14:59.800,0:15:03.800
the little resources you can obtain.

0:15:03.800,0:15:06.480
Tell your neighbour, "Faith is a Heavenly currency."

0:15:06.480,0:15:08.340
[Faith is a Heavenly currency.]

0:15:08.340,0:15:14.080
You go to a market, you cannot purchase more than your money.

0:15:14.080,0:15:18.160
Your responsibility should not be greater than your spiritual life.

0:15:18.160,0:15:25.400
Today, our responsibility seems to be much more than our spiritual life.

0:15:25.400,0:15:33.520
Therefore, whatever blessing you receive, is like dropping a stone in the ocean.

0:15:33.520,0:15:36.700
If I'm talking to you.

0:15:36.700,0:15:43.000
Your responsibility seems to be much greater than your spiritual life.

0:15:43.000,0:15:50.420
Whatever blessing you now receive is like dropping a needle in the ocean.

0:15:50.420,0:15:57.940
When you receive a big blessing; by the time you get home you realize that it is not enough.

0:15:57.940,0:16:04.520
OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION

0:16:04.520,0:16:16.600
My success depends on my meditation and confession.

0:16:16.600,0:16:20.480
Yes.

0:16:20.480,0:16:26.260
If you have been mediating before prayer, you will get to God.

0:16:26.260,0:16:41.040
You know I said it from the beginning, faith is not a panic button to push – only in time of trouble, you pray.

0:16:41.040,0:16:44.100
Only in times of trouble, you seek the face of God.

0:16:44.100,0:16:46.420
Only in times of trouble, you fast and pray.

0:16:46.420,0:16:50.040
Only in times of trouble, you begin to run helter skelter.

0:16:50.040,0:16:52.460
That is not faith.

0:16:52.460,0:17:01.160
Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.

0:17:01.160,0:17:06.420
How can you trust in God without mediation?

0:17:06.420,0:17:10.860
This is why I gave you faith-bracelets.

0:17:10.860,0:17:21.380
If you want to get it as a Christian - now meditation starts.

0:17:21.380,0:17:27.700
In your office, "Take more of me, oh God; give me more of You."

0:17:27.700,0:17:31.920
If you use it for one month - you don't need it.

0:17:31.920,0:17:37.340
It will become a habit to your heart to say, "Take more of me, give me more of You".

0:17:37.340,0:17:41.840
While you are talking to your boss, your heart would be saying, "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:17:41.840,0:17:45.340
While you are inside the bus, "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:17:45.340,0:17:50.280
While you are sitting down, your heart is supposed to be saying that, "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:17:50.280,0:17:54.780
If you are not saying it, and you are only looking at me; this means that this message will not get you

0:17:54.780,0:17:56.160
anywhere in your life.

0:17:56.160,0:17:59.380
You only hear it and you get it out of your head.

0:17:59.380,0:18:01.980
This is why you cannot make use of the message.

0:18:01.980,0:18:07.760
As you are looking at me now, your heart should be busy saying, "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:18:07.760,0:18:10.680
Oh Lord - give me more of You...

0:18:10.680,0:18:14.720
As you listen to me, continue to meditate on that.

0:18:14.720,0:18:16.860
Let that become your habit.

0:18:16.860,0:18:22.980
That is what you mean by a lifestyle of trusting in God.

0:18:22.980,0:18:24.520
It is not a prayer.

0:18:24.520,0:18:30.040
You pray only in time of trouble.

0:18:30.040,0:18:36.700
As you are looking at me, begin to engage your heart, "take more of me, give me more of You".

0:18:36.700,0:18:39.920
That is the best language to use for now.

0:18:39.920,0:18:41.260
Don't go too far.

0:18:41.260,0:18:49.580
I said to you at the beginning; the Word builds Christ's nature in us.

0:18:49.580,0:18:51.020
The Word builds what?

0:18:51.020,0:18:52.620
[Christ nature.]

0:18:52.620,0:18:58.060
Christ possesses a nature that makes it easy for me and you to trust in Him.

0:18:58.060,0:18:59.620
What is His nature?

0:18:59.620,0:19:04.500
His nature – faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, humility, purity -

0:19:04.500,0:19:08.420
the fruits of the Spirit are the nature of Christ.

0:19:08.420,0:19:11.140
Take more of me; give me more of You.

0:19:11.140,0:19:13.960
That is the nature of Christ is what you demand for.

0:19:13.960,0:19:21.680
More of Your faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, purity - because you are more of yourself.

0:19:21.680,0:19:34.660
More of yourself is unfaithfulness, disobedience, impurity.

0:19:34.660,0:19:38.340
More of yourself is disobedience.

0:19:38.340,0:19:43.540
More of yourself is opposite of the fruits of the Spirit.

0:19:43.540,0:19:49.540
You want Him to take more of you and give you more of Him.

0:19:49.540,0:19:52.840
Right now, I hope your heart is engaging in that.

0:19:52.840,0:19:55.280
Let me see if your heart is engaging that.

0:19:55.280,0:19:57.540
Right now it is a task.

0:19:57.540,0:20:03.780
When you leave here, when you will be eating, you will be in the restroom, nothing should stop your heart

0:20:03.780,0:20:05.000
from meditating on this.

0:20:05.000,0:20:08.400
While you are talking... - and I told you we are not using the same medium.

0:20:08.400,0:20:12.720
When you are talking, you are talking with your mouth to a man, and with your heart to God.

0:20:12.720,0:20:13.960
It is not the same medium.

0:20:13.960,0:20:15.780
You can do both at the same time.

0:20:15.780,0:20:17.160
Please, let me see your hand.

0:20:17.160,0:20:20.240
Your heart, right now, is engaging that.

0:20:20.240,0:20:22.700
Take more of me, give me more of You.

0:20:22.700,0:20:25.860
When you say, "Take more of me, give me more of You" that is -

0:20:25.860,0:20:31.200
more of God is faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, purity,

0:20:31.200,0:20:36.820
obedience, humility – these are the nature of God.

0:20:36.820,0:20:40.680
This makes it possible for you to have faith.

0:20:40.680,0:20:44.520
This makes it possible for you to increase your faith.

0:20:44.520,0:20:48.900
You can increase your faith; you can have faith.

0:20:48.900,0:20:56.460
We have faith when we have more of the fruits of the Spirit – more of God.

0:20:56.460,0:21:01.600
The more your meditation, the more you have faith.

0:21:01.600,0:21:04.100
Please, let me see your hand.

0:21:04.100,0:21:10.720
So, you think that if you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation that you have faith - no.

0:21:10.720,0:21:14.920
There is nothing bad about it - it is good to read the Bible.

0:21:14.920,0:21:18.620
Faith originates from God.

0:21:18.620,0:21:25.420
If faith originates from God, you must acknowledge His faithfulness and trustworthiness.

0:21:25.420,0:21:29.600
Acknowledging is by meditation in your heart.

0:21:29.600,0:21:35.400
Right now, let me see your hand if your heart is engaged in this now.

0:21:35.400,0:21:39.720
We want to stand up and promise that nothing will stop me,

0:21:39.720,0:21:46.120
nothing will break my heart, nothing will stop my heart from meditating.

0:21:46.120,0:21:51.140
Nothing; when I'm in the bedroom, when I'm eating, when I'm talking to my colleague...

0:21:51.140,0:21:53.820
Even you pastors, when you minister...

0:21:53.820,0:22:02.360
As I minister to you, my heart is yearning for this, my heart is communicating this, my heart is talking this.

0:22:02.360,0:22:04.600
My heart is saying something.

0:22:04.600,0:22:06.320
Take more of me...

0:22:06.320,0:22:11.760
Let me see your hand if your heart is meditating now.

0:22:11.760,0:22:14.220
Let's rise up and make a promise.

0:22:14.220,0:22:16.220
Everyday I talk about this.

0:22:16.220,0:22:18.420
You don't know how serious it is.

0:22:18.420,0:22:23.700
I don't know how you can grow; you can never, it is not possible.

0:22:23.700,0:22:29.660
Reading the Bible from Genesis to Revelation every week - that cannot make you grow.

0:22:29.660,0:22:31.340
You need God.

0:22:31.340,0:22:38.300
Viewers, anywhere you are, whatever medium you are using to view us right now,

0:22:38.300,0:22:41.520
I want you to join us in this promise before God.

0:22:41.520,0:22:48.840
The Lord says, "I will make your heart a dwelling place. I will make your heart My home".

0:22:48.840,0:22:54.680
How can God make our heart home when we are not inviting God into our heart?

0:22:54.680,0:22:56.840
This is an invitation to God.

0:22:56.840,0:23:00.320
Out of abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

0:23:00.320,0:23:01.720
Out of abundance of what?

0:23:01.720,0:23:04.160
[Heart.]

0:23:04.160,0:23:08.280
Some of you will say, "Out of abundance of the stomach".

0:23:08.280,0:23:15.920
What is in your stomach?
Rice.

0:23:15.920,0:23:21.100
Out of abundance of your stomach the restroom takes.

0:23:21.100,0:23:23.680
Out of abundance of what?

0:23:23.680,0:23:24.900
Say "Heart!"

0:23:24.900,0:23:26.200
[Heart.]

0:23:26.200,0:23:29.720
This is the language for Christians.

0:23:29.720,0:23:33.560
Not for others; others will say, "Out of abundance of the stomach."

0:23:33.560,0:23:35.440
It is not from our stomach.

0:23:35.440,0:23:39.980
Out of abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

0:23:39.980,0:23:44.060
When you are pregnant of God, you speak of God.

0:23:44.060,0:23:51.820
Viewers at home, nothing should stop you or break you from meditation.

0:23:51.820,0:23:57.780
OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION

0:23:57.780,0:24:00.220
That is the topic of this message.

0:24:00.220,0:24:08.480
OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION

0:24:08.480,0:24:09.440
Say it again.

0:24:09.440,0:24:13.980
[OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION]

0:24:13.980,0:24:19.380
But you believe our success depends on our prayer - the number of prayers you pray.

0:24:19.380,0:24:24.200
Which kind of prayer is that when you are not living the life of God and you are praying?

0:24:24.200,0:24:26.940
A break in faith is a break in God.

0:24:26.940,0:24:29.880
When you break in faith, you break in God.

0:24:29.880,0:24:36.260
Already, you have broken that relationship and you are now calling and inviting God to rescue you.

0:24:36.260,0:24:39.280
No - you must flow with God before you can pray.

0:24:39.280,0:24:41.480
Meditation makes you to flow with God.

0:24:41.480,0:24:45.680
A break in faith is a break in God.

0:24:45.680,0:24:51.140
In order not to break in faith, we must invite the nature of God.

0:24:51.140,0:24:53.780
Now - there should be no break.

0:24:53.780,0:25:01.400
Rise up your hand and make this promise - "Take more of me..." - speak it loud, before we register in our heart.

0:25:01.400,0:25:08.480
Oh Lord, take more of me; give me more of You.

0:25:08.480,0:25:24.420
More of Your faithfulness, honesty, obedience, purity, kindness, goodness, and self-control.

0:25:24.420,0:25:30.520
Oh Lord, take more of me; give me more of You.

0:25:30.520,0:25:33.900
More of You...

0:25:33.900,0:25:39.300
This is what your heart should be yearning for all the time, should be speaking all the time.

0:25:39.300,0:25:41.440
Take more of me, give me more of You.

0:25:41.440,0:25:44.400
Because you are more of yourself, that is why you misbehave.

0:25:44.400,0:25:47.840
That is why we cannot control ourselves.

0:25:47.840,0:25:50.420
What we are not willing to do is what we find ourselves doing.

0:25:50.420,0:25:56.980
"I will not do this again" but you still go back and do it.

0:25:56.980,0:26:00.300
You have made a promise – "Take more of me; give me more of You".

0:26:00.300,0:26:01.660
Your lips should not move.

0:26:01.660,0:26:04.300
When your heart is talking, nobody would know it.

0:26:04.300,0:26:07.180
When your lips are moving, it shows that you are talking.

0:26:07.180,0:26:09.960
It is your heart that is talking this time.

0:26:09.960,0:26:12.140
There should be no break.

0:26:12.140,0:26:20.540
When you are about to sleep... yes - you are going on the wonderful journey.

0:26:20.540,0:26:25.040
You say this before going sleep - what a wonderful dream.

0:26:25.040,0:26:30.880
This is why you don't understand your dream; you have broken the relationship before you pray.

0:26:30.880,0:26:36.760
Tell your neighbour, "You have broken the relationship before you pray".

0:26:36.760,0:26:38.320
Whom are you praying with?

0:26:38.320,0:26:42.740
You have broken the relationship before you sleep.

0:26:42.740,0:26:46.720
Who will guide you?

0:26:46.720,0:26:49.120
Which is true of you?

0:26:49.120,0:26:54.880
Before now, you were just coming to the altar wanting to pray.

0:26:54.880,0:27:01.060
You have broken the relationship; now you are starting to pray...

0:27:01.060,0:27:05.820
You want to sleep; you have broken the relationship before sleeping.

0:27:05.820,0:27:07.420
This relationship should not be what?

0:27:07.420,0:27:08.460
[Broken.]

0:27:08.460,0:27:10.060
Should not be broken.

0:27:10.060,0:27:13.520
This is when you can carry God along.

0:27:13.520,0:27:16.960
This is like you have asked me to leave you and I left you.

0:27:16.960,0:27:21.420
Later, when you have a problem and you start to call me.

0:27:21.420,0:27:24.580
You start to call, "T.B. Joshua, please help".

0:27:24.580,0:27:28.400
You know that you have asked me to leave you.

0:27:28.400,0:27:29.940
That is the case of God.

0:27:29.940,0:27:34.280
A break in faith is a break in God.

0:27:34.280,0:27:39.560
Now, in order not to have that break again – meditation.

0:27:39.560,0:27:42.200
Meditation brings revelation.

0:27:42.200,0:27:47.900
Meditation in the Word of God is a visit with God.

0:27:47.900,0:27:52.340
When you continue to meditate, "Take more of me; give me more of You", you have visited God.

0:27:52.340,0:27:55.500
Before you know it, you begin to see revelation.

0:27:55.500,0:27:57.440
Before you know it, you dream a dream.

0:27:57.440,0:27:59.920
The promise of God will now come to your life.

0:27:59.920,0:28:02.140
You don’t need money to have peace.

0:28:02.140,0:28:05.420
You just need a revelation and relationship with God.

0:28:05.420,0:28:11.340
When God asks you, "Go to this place and get your money, contract, go and rest.

0:28:11.340,0:28:12.760
Today you are not going out".

0:28:12.760,0:28:14.020
OK - relax.

0:28:14.020,0:28:19.480
"Don't worry, go to this country; they will get you money. You need to rest .

0:28:19.480,0:28:22.340
You need to meet Me - go and fast for 3 days."

0:28:22.340,0:28:24.900
These are the things you need.

0:28:24.900,0:28:28.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:28.660,0:28:31.540
Tell your neighbour, "You need an appointment with God".

0:28:31.540,0:28:33.100
[You need an appointment with God.]

0:28:33.100,0:28:36.140
You know; it is possible to have an appointment with God.

0:28:36.140,0:28:41.940
When you are eating, you are about to finish - God would say, "Stop. Meet Me."

0:28:41.940,0:28:43.340
That is fasting.

0:28:43.340,0:28:47.500
And you have eaten the half of the food - right now meet Me.

0:28:47.500,0:28:51.160
You wash your hands, you go straight to your bedroom, you lie down and start praying.

0:28:51.160,0:28:53.260
God says I should meet Him.

0:28:53.260,0:28:56.500
Appointment with God will change the course of your life.

0:28:56.500,0:29:01.420
You don't have an appointment with God.

0:29:01.420,0:29:07.560
Tell me, how long you hear God saying, "Go and meet this man - he will give you a business".

0:29:07.560,0:29:11.380
I want to stand here as a Prophet telling you today:

0:29:11.380,0:29:18.760
"The key I have given you today is the key of success."

0:29:18.760,0:29:21.600
Don’t be too excited and forget your meditation.

0:29:21.600,0:29:30.840
Tell your neighbour, "Don’t be too excited with whatever happens on the outside and forget your mediation."

0:29:30.840,0:29:33.260
Tell your neighbour again.

0:29:33.260,0:29:37.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:37.920,0:29:39.600
Yes, this is what has happened.

0:29:39.600,0:29:47.700
Suddenly you see somebody saying, "I have a contract of 3 billion dollar".

0:29:47.700,0:29:52.220
You would be overwhelmed, "How much?"

0:29:52.220,0:29:57.460
You would forget your mediation because of money.

0:29:57.460,0:30:01.840
Just because you heard of such money you forgot about the meditation.

0:30:01.840,0:30:06.360
But when this man disappoints you, you will remember your mediation.

0:30:06.360,0:30:08.800
If I'm talking to you.

0:30:08.800,0:30:12.600
When you are disappointed you will do what?

0:30:12.600,0:30:13.820
You will remember your meditation.

0:30:13.820,0:30:16.440
That man says now, "I am sorry. I will not be able to do it".

0:30:16.440,0:30:19.180
Oh, take more of me; give me more of You.

0:30:19.180,0:30:25.000
If you see people rushing to pray - they have a problem.

0:30:25.000,0:30:26.380
That is not faith.

0:30:26.380,0:30:35.400
Faith is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.

0:30:35.400,0:30:41.220
Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.

0:30:41.220,0:30:55.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:55.060,0:30:58.720
Trust and obey

0:30:58.720,0:31:03.280
For there is no other way

0:31:03.280,0:31:09.000
To be happy in Jesus

0:31:09.000,0:31:14.880
But to trust and obey

0:31:14.880,0:31:17.840
This would not allow you to talk too much.

0:31:17.840,0:31:23.100
You would not talk too much, when you know that you are not like others.

0:31:23.100,0:31:27.040
You think you are like others when you are not here.

0:31:27.040,0:31:31.640
Here you are not like others, outside you are not like others, in the market you are not like others,

0:31:31.640,0:31:41.840
in the political party; when you are there negotiating - don't forget you are not like others.

0:31:41.840,0:31:44.460
Tell your neighbour, "Here, you are not like others."

0:31:44.460,0:31:45.920
[Here, you are not like others.]

0:31:45.920,0:31:47.720
Outside there, you are not like others.

0:31:47.720,0:31:49.140
[Outside there, you are not like others.]

0:31:49.140,0:31:51.340
At the bus stop, you are not like others.

0:31:51.340,0:31:52.420
[At the bus stop, you are not like others.]

0:31:52.420,0:31:55.260
In your political circle, you are not like others.

0:31:55.260,0:31:56.600
[In your political circle, you are not like others.]

0:31:56.600,0:31:58.580
In the market, you are not like others.

0:31:58.580,0:31:59.780
[In the market, you are not like others.]

0:31:59.780,0:32:02.860
In the business circle, you are not like others.

0:32:02.860,0:32:05.120
Don't forget, you are not like others!

0:32:05.120,0:32:07.980
[Don't forget, you are not like others.]

0:32:07.980,0:32:11.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:11.740,0:32:13.800
You are not like others, you have forgotten yourself.

0:32:13.800,0:32:18.180
Only when you are in church, you believe you are not like others.

0:32:18.180,0:32:23.180
Immediately you leave here, you forget what you stand for.

0:32:23.180,0:32:24.140
You have forgotten.

0:32:24.140,0:32:27.180
This is why you return to your past life.

0:32:27.180,0:32:29.460
This is why you return to your past glory.

0:32:29.460,0:32:31.880
You always return to your past glory.

0:32:31.880,0:32:37.940
If I have been returned to the past glory you would not come here today.

0:32:37.940,0:32:42.020
When you leave here, you forget yourself.

0:32:42.020,0:32:43.060
You are not like others.

0:32:43.060,0:32:47.840
Even inside the plane... at the airport, when you are sitting down, remember - you are not like others.

0:32:47.840,0:32:54.080
Your meditation - tell your neighbour, "You are not like others - your meditation".

0:32:54.080,0:32:57.380
It is your meditation that makes you different.

0:32:57.380,0:33:02.860
When you meditate with your heart, you will not have time to talk anyhow.

0:33:02.860,0:33:07.600
You will not give yourself to anything out there.

0:33:07.600,0:33:13.780
When you are at the airport to connect your flight, and it is delayed, you say, "Thank You, Jesus -

0:33:13.780,0:33:16.020
an opportunity to meditate".

0:33:16.020,0:33:21.260
But you - you say, "Oh my God. God will punish them."

0:33:21.260,0:33:23.600
Whom God will punish?

0:33:23.600,0:33:28.920
When your flight is delayed, it is an opportunity to meditate.

0:33:28.920,0:33:37.820
When you are inside the aircraft - "Wow, an opportunity to meditate".

0:33:37.820,0:33:40.400
You are not like others.

0:33:40.400,0:33:48.400
You only believe in prayer because the Bible says, "Prayer is the key".

0:33:48.400,0:33:50.760
Sing down there.

0:33:50.760,0:33:58.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:58.440,0:34:01.200
Why can't you open that door?

0:34:01.200,0:34:03.600
Prayer is the key.

0:34:03.600,0:34:09.860
You fail to do what you need to do before the prayer.

0:34:09.860,0:34:14.620
The processing - there is a processing before the prayer.

0:34:14.620,0:34:20.360
You want to make a soup; you need so many ingredients to put together.

0:34:20.360,0:34:24.780
You need water, you need salt...

0:34:24.780,0:34:28.460
If any of these things misses it will give a different taste.

0:34:28.460,0:34:31.100
The soup will have a different taste.

0:34:31.100,0:34:37.380
The processing you need to pass through before prayer - you fail to pass through it.

0:34:37.380,0:34:38.580
Come brother.

0:34:38.580,0:34:43.220
This is God.

0:34:43.220,0:34:47.180
You have to get to God before you can call Him.

0:34:47.180,0:34:50.940
You can't stand here and say, "God!"

0:34:50.940,0:34:54.200
That is not a nature of God.

0:34:54.200,0:34:57.680
You need to meditate to get to God.

0:34:57.680,0:35:04.920
It is the meditation that will get you to God.

0:35:04.920,0:35:07.480
Now, it is time to pray.

0:35:07.480,0:35:15.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:15.300,0:35:17.800
Wait there.

0:35:17.800,0:35:28.760
The nature of God does not permit us to shout from here, "God! I need a biscuit, I need food!" - No.

0:35:28.760,0:35:29.360
It is wrong.

0:35:29.360,0:35:30.840
This is what you are doing.

0:35:30.840,0:35:38.800
Because from here to God there are so many obstacles, that will stop your voice from reaching God.

0:35:38.800,0:35:41.280
If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.

0:35:41.280,0:35:44.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:44.540,0:35:56.920
From here to God there is so many obstacles; your unfaithfulness, unkindness, disobedience,

0:35:56.920,0:35:59.720
demon in your house, all sorts of things.

0:35:59.720,0:36:05.380
They are there to block your voice from reaching God.

0:36:05.380,0:36:08.660
Now, you have a role to play.

0:36:08.660,0:36:13.080
It is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to you.

0:36:13.080,0:36:15.500
You have a role to play and God has a role to play.

0:36:15.500,0:36:18.300
God is to hear you when you get to Him.

0:36:18.300,0:36:22.620
To get to Him, it is by meditation.

0:36:22.620,0:36:27.580
Meditation in the Word is a visit to God.

0:36:27.580,0:36:30.960
I'm going to visit God now.

0:36:30.960,0:36:32.980
Take more of me; give me more of You.

0:36:32.980,0:36:36.200
It will help me to overcome these obstacles.

0:36:36.200,0:36:40.100
Take more of me; give me more of You.

0:36:40.100,0:36:42.400
If you get to God, you will know.

0:36:42.400,0:36:45.680
Your spirit will tell you that you are getting to God.

0:36:45.680,0:36:49.040
You'll hear voices in your heart.

0:36:49.040,0:36:54.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:54.040,0:37:01.020
The closer you get to God the more you begin to sense the presence of holiness.

0:37:01.020,0:37:07.380
You will sense it immediately as you get closer to Him.

0:37:07.380,0:37:14.920
Now I'm here - I sense it: a visit with God.

0:37:14.920,0:37:16.720
Now, what do I need to do?

0:37:16.720,0:37:21.740
Lord, thank You for your grace, mercy...

0:37:21.740,0:37:23.460
He will tell you what to pray for.

0:37:23.460,0:37:27.580
Not you, dictating Him, but He will tell you what to ask for.

0:37:27.580,0:37:30.940
You should not ask; He will tell you what to demand for.

0:37:30.940,0:37:34.220
You should not demand.

0:37:34.220,0:37:37.220
Here.

0:37:37.220,0:37:40.700
This is the meaning of mediation.

0:37:40.700,0:37:44.140
When you get here, revelation will come.

0:37:44.140,0:37:48.800
Who gives revelation?
God!

0:37:48.800,0:37:57.280
Revelation does not come from us, human origin or senses but from God, just like faith we are talking about.

0:37:57.280,0:38:01.600
Now, you sense that revelation.

0:38:01.600,0:38:02.940
What is a revelation?

0:38:02.940,0:38:12.060
Revelation means He will tell you what to ask for, what to demand for, how to pray, when to pray -

0:38:12.060,0:38:14.400
that is revelation.

0:38:14.400,0:38:17.540
You may not be able to maintain this all days.

0:38:17.540,0:38:22.260
You are here already and you are supposed to stay here, and continue to be with God.

0:38:22.260,0:38:24.560
Because of the wall you find yourself against...

0:38:24.560,0:38:34.940
You go to work, you are working under, ... environment is not conducive - you go back.

0:38:34.940,0:38:38.400
That is why you should meditate all the time.

0:38:38.400,0:38:43.220
A break in meditation - you cannot get to God.

0:38:43.220,0:38:52.320
Please, don't be too excited and overwhelmed with what is on the outside and forget you meditation.

0:38:52.320,0:38:55.800
If you don't meditate, you cannot get revelation.

0:38:55.800,0:38:59.460
If you don’t have revelation, what are you praying for?

0:38:59.460,0:39:04.880
We don't know how to pray; the Holy Spirit teaches us.

0:39:04.880,0:39:09.160
Do you know that prayer has its own language?

0:39:09.160,0:39:10.880
Thank you.

0:39:10.880,0:39:16.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:16.660,0:39:23.180
Right now, you have to bow down your head and say, "I will not break this relationship".

0:39:23.180,0:39:24.880
I will not break my meditation.

0:39:24.880,0:39:31.400
Nothing will be too exciting on the outside to make me break my meditation.

0:39:31.400,0:39:35.340
You have been given the anointed word: "Take more of me; give me more of You."

0:39:35.340,0:39:36.980
This is the anointed word given to you.

0:39:36.980,0:39:39.700
Right now, make this promise.

0:39:39.700,0:39:48.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:48.300,0:39:50.880
This makes you different from others.

0:39:50.880,0:39:53.220
When you are out there, you are not like others.

0:39:53.220,0:39:59.540
Others live life of the outside - what they see on the outside dictates their direction;

0:39:59.540,0:40:02.760
what you see on the inside dictates your direction.

0:40:02.760,0:40:05.740
What they see on the outside dictates their direction.

0:40:05.740,0:40:08.120
But you – you are not like others.

0:40:08.120,0:40:11.900
This is why you have to invite God into your heart.

0:40:11.900,0:40:19.060
God says, "I want to make your heart My home".

0:40:19.060,0:40:24.760
Right now begin to speak the word: Take more of me; give me more of You in your heart.

0:40:24.760,0:40:27.680
Believe it and He will bring it to pass.

0:40:27.680,0:40:29.900
Right now.

0:40:29.900,0:40:33.100
Begin to meditate this word in your heart.

0:40:33.100,0:40:37.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:37.600,0:40:45.420
Meditate this word and believe it; He will bring it to pass.

0:40:45.420,0:40:55.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:55.740,0:40:57.640
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:40:57.640,0:40:58.440
[Amen.]

0:40:58.440,0:40:59.980
Thank You, Lord.

0:40:59.980,0:41:02.760
Hallelujah.
You may be seated.

0:41:02.760,0:41:07.300
Don't be too excited and forget your meditation.

0:41:07.300,0:41:14.580
Continue and this will become a lifestyle of trusting God.

0:41:14.580,0:41:19.200
Tell your neighbour, "A lifestyle of trusting God".

0:41:19.200,0:41:25.300
A lifestyle of trusting in God - I cannot hear you.

0:41:25.300,0:41:27.640
[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]

0:41:27.640,0:41:29.040
I cannot hear you.

0:41:29.040,0:41:30.840
[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]

0:41:30.840,0:41:31.840
I cannot hear you.

0:41:31.840,0:41:33.780
[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]

0:41:33.780,0:41:35.140
Again and again.

0:41:35.140,0:41:36.380
[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]

0:41:36.380,0:41:39.880
Don't be afraid that you don't meditate while you are talking - no.

0:41:39.880,0:41:43.320
You can be saying it and at the same time the meditation continues.

0:41:43.320,0:41:49.340
The message you have received will come in your meditation.

0:41:49.340,0:41:56.080
Meditation will allow you to remember all you have seen and happened around you.

0:41:56.080,0:41:58.680
By meditation, you will have revelation about your friends -

0:41:58.680,0:42:03.860
there are many friends you have but they are not friends.

0:42:03.860,0:42:07.560
There are many companions you have but they are not.

0:42:07.560,0:42:13.680
People around you are so many – you need to know whom they are, what they stand for.

0:42:13.680,0:42:15.220
Thank You, Lord.

0:42:15.220,0:42:16.540
Hallelujah.
