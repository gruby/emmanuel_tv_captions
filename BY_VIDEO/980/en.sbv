Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:05.560,0:00:09.980
My name is Tendani Nematandani.

0:00:09.980,0:00:14.500
I'm from South Africa.

0:00:14.500,0:00:25.080
The reason that made me come to The SCOAN was barrenness for 15 years.

0:00:25.080,0:00:33.740
In 2013, I came to The SCOAN because of barrenness due to my husband's low sperm count.

0:00:33.740,0:00:41.720
The doctors had told us that our chances were very slim for me to fall pregnant.

0:00:41.720,0:00:48.340
There was no way medically that I could fall pregnant.

0:00:48.340,0:00:57.840
They even suggested that I could either do artificial insemination or IVF.

0:00:57.840,0:01:13.060
They gave me the prices of doing IVF and indicated that you can do it up to five times

0:01:13.060,0:01:16.100
and not have a baby.

0:01:16.100,0:01:24.000
When they gave me the prices, it was around 50,000 Rands each.

0:01:24.000,0:01:33.480
If it failed, it meant I was going to pay another 50,000 Rands to do another artifical insemination.

0:01:33.480,0:01:41.240
I went back home with my husband, we sat down and decided,

0:01:41.240,0:01:47.900
"Let's seek the face of God; let's go to The SCOAN".

0:01:47.900,0:01:55.620
Even when we came here, some family friends asked if it could be true that I would fall pregnant.

0:01:55.620,0:02:01.600
Before coming here, tell us what you experienced and how your husband felt,

0:02:01.600,0:02:07.920
knowing that it was because he had low sperm count that you couldn't conceive a child.

0:02:07.920,0:02:12.060
That was a very difficult situation.

0:02:12.060,0:02:18.240
The pain that I endured was so much in such a way that every month,

0:02:18.240,0:02:24.800
instead of, as a woman, being happy when I saw my menstruation,

0:02:24.800,0:02:30.080
for me it was pain because when I saw menstruation, it meant I was not pregnant.

0:02:30.080,0:02:36.460
When people invited me for baby showers and birthdays for the kids,

0:02:36.460,0:02:41.680
I would sit down and think about whether I should go or not.

0:02:41.680,0:02:48.700
When I saw other women talking about children, sometimes I felt that they were talking about me.

0:02:48.700,0:02:55.260
Some people used to confront me to ask how many children I had.

0:02:55.260,0:03:00.020
That is painful if you know you don't have a child and the person is asking you

0:03:00.020,0:03:05.640
how many children you have and how many years you have been married.

0:03:05.640,0:03:07.720
That was so painful.

0:03:07.720,0:03:15.140
I didn't want anyone to ask me about a child or when I was married

0:03:15.140,0:03:19.000
because to me that was a pain in my life.

0:03:19.000,0:03:27.840
I went to different avenues to find a solution but I couldn't find a solution.

0:03:27.840,0:03:37.680
I would sit down and cry alone because I could not take the pain.

0:03:37.680,0:03:43.720
The way it was, there were some times that I felt it was better to leave my marriage.

0:03:43.720,0:03:50.520
Just go without saying anything because I felt like I was an embarrassment.

0:03:50.520,0:03:55.860
My family members would even talk behind my back.

0:03:55.860,0:04:02.120
The experience of not having a child as a woman was so painful.

0:04:02.120,0:04:07.220
So how did you finally hear about The SCOAN and decided to come?

0:04:07.220,0:04:12.860
The other day, I decided to scroll the public channels.

0:04:12.860,0:04:18.060
As I was scrolling, I found Emmanuel TV.

0:04:18.060,0:04:24.120
There was a lady in a passage giving birth within five minutes

0:04:24.120,0:04:29.480
because she was overdue - ten months and when I saw that, I was so surprised.

0:04:29.480,0:04:33.800
I said to myself, "Wow! Is this really happening? Where is this place?"

0:04:33.800,0:04:38.040
I started watching and when my husband came back,

0:04:38.040,0:04:42.520
I told him, "I saw a miracle today! I saw a woman giving birth".

0:04:42.520,0:04:56.100
Then, from there, I started following Emmanuel TV until I found out how to come to The SCOAN.

0:04:56.100,0:04:58.120
I came with my husband.

0:04:58.120,0:05:01.320
The man of God prayed for us.

0:05:01.320,0:05:06.660
After praying, he said, "It is well".

0:05:06.660,0:05:11.160
We were also opportune to be given the Morning Water.

0:05:11.160,0:05:17.060
When we went back home to South Africa, as I kept on ministering the Morning Water.

0:05:17.060,0:05:24.160
From there, my menstruation started to be very heavy with lots of big fluids.

0:05:24.160,0:05:34.040
I couldn't understand what was going on but I kept on holding to the Word of God - "It is well".

0:05:34.040,0:05:39.520
For five months, my system was being cleaned because as time went on,

0:05:39.520,0:05:43.220
my menstruation became normal again.

0:05:43.220,0:05:52.480
After ministering Morning Water, we met as husband and wife and after meeting,

0:05:52.480,0:05:54.480
I went to work the next day.

0:05:54.480,0:05:56.260
I started vomiting.

0:05:56.260,0:05:59.760
When I started vomiting, my mind was not yet there.

0:05:59.760,0:06:04.820
When a colleague said, "You are pregnant", I said, "That is impossible; I am not pregnant".

0:06:04.820,0:06:06.640
I couldn't believe it myself.

0:06:06.640,0:06:11.480
I went to the chemist and bought a home pregnancy test.

0:06:11.480,0:06:13.740
Then, I did the pregnancy test.

0:06:13.740,0:06:20.680
I was so shocked when I saw the two red colours.

0:06:20.680,0:06:25.440
I started jumping, saying, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:06:25.440,0:06:28.300
Hallelujah!

0:06:28.300,0:06:31.440
That meant that I was pregnant.

0:06:31.440,0:06:34.900
I was so excited that I didn't know what to do.

0:06:34.900,0:06:41.740
I thanked God, sang, praised God and said, "God, You are a wonderful God!

0:06:41.740,0:06:47.280
You never fail us and even me, You remembered me at Your time".

0:06:47.280,0:06:50.340
While Mrs Nemantandani was several months pregnant,

0:06:50.340,0:06:54.920
the Emmanuel TV Team caught up with her and her husband in South Africa.

0:06:54.920,0:07:00.420
Mr & Mrs Nematandani
Pregnancy Testimony

0:07:00.420,0:07:05.540
As you heard my wife saying, I think she said it all.

0:07:05.540,0:07:13.240
What I am happy about is that God's time is the best.

0:07:13.240,0:07:18.760
We waited so long for this time to happen and here it is.

0:07:18.760,0:07:21.280
I only praise God for what has happened.

0:07:21.280,0:07:27.080
A few weeks later, the Emmanuel TV Team visited Mrs Nemantandani and her husband at the hospital after her delivery.

0:07:27.080,0:07:32.380
The Emmanuel TV Team Visit Mr & Mrs
Nematandani In Hospital After Her Delivery

0:07:32.380,0:07:40.060
A few weeks later, the Emmanuel TV Team visited Mrs Nemantandani in hospital after her delivery.

0:07:40.060,0:07:52.140
After nine months of pregnancy, I gave birth to a baby girl on the third of May.

0:07:52.140,0:08:02.720
Her name means 'Light' as in Isaiah 61, "Arise and shine as the light has come upon you".

0:08:02.720,0:08:04.940
She will be three years old tomorrow.

0:08:04.940,0:08:08.940
Let's clap for Jesus.

0:08:08.940,0:08:18.860
This was the joy that I didn't want to miss out in my life.

0:08:18.860,0:08:23.620
I want to be with her in each every step of the way.

0:08:23.620,0:08:28.860
Even if she cries, that is the joy of being a mother; I enjoy it.

0:08:28.860,0:08:34.200
This is the blessing - God has trusted me with this baby.

0:08:34.200,0:08:39.160
What I do is to ask God to give me wisdom to take care of this baby.

0:08:39.160,0:08:47.120
By myself, I can't. He trusted me after 15 years.

0:08:47.120,0:08:54.220
What I can say is do not concentrate on your situation.

0:08:54.220,0:09:04.600
Leave it for God; then, He will take care of your situation as He did for me.

0:09:04.600,0:09:09.160
Amen. And we know there are many of us here that have been listening to your testimony.

0:09:09.160,0:09:14.580
And we know that we have few questions - one or two questions from the audience here.

0:09:14.580,0:09:19.680
Emmanuel! My name is Xolewa Meche from South Africa.

0:09:19.680,0:09:27.240
My question to madam at the front is for two categories of people.

0:09:27.240,0:09:37.280
I want to know the reaction from the people like your in-laws and the doctors

0:09:37.280,0:09:40.560
when they discovered that you were pregnant

0:09:40.560,0:09:46.260
What was their reaction and what was your response to them?

0:09:46.260,0:09:52.120
My family members couldn't believe it that I was pregnant.

0:09:52.120,0:09:59.280
Everyone was shocked and were busy phoning me to ask if it was real. I said, "Yes".

0:09:59.280,0:10:05.000
The doctor was so shocked, "How can you be pregnant

0:10:05.000,0:10:09.520
whereas we told you, you cannot be pregnant?"

0:10:09.520,0:10:15.420
The doctor was so shocked, also considering my age but I said, "It didn't matter.

0:10:15.420,0:10:21.040
The God who trusted me with this gift will take care of her".

0:10:21.040,0:10:23.780
Amen. Thank you.

0:10:23.780,0:10:27.780
My name is Kaba Mamba from Zambia.

0:10:27.780,0:10:35.000
I just wanted to find out - the years, they were too much, 15 years, and you were in such pain.

0:10:35.000,0:10:41.960
But I heard, if I got you correctly, you talked of after you had come with your husband

0:10:41.960,0:10:46.580
from here SCOAN, you stayed for almost six to seven months.

0:10:46.580,0:10:52.120
I wanted to find out: What was the reaction of your husband during that period?

0:10:52.120,0:10:58.960
My husband was still believing in God because he used to encourage me, saying,

0:10:58.960,0:11:01.640
"Tendani, let's focus on God.

0:11:01.640,0:11:07.320
We went to The SCOAN where things are happening; do not lose hope".

0:11:07.320,0:11:13.420
He kept on encouraging me even when he sensed that I was losing hope,

0:11:13.420,0:11:20.100
he kept on saying, "Let's focus on God and see what God can do for us".

0:11:20.100,0:11:22.320
Thank you.

0:11:22.320,0:11:26.980
So finally, if there is anything you would like to say. Over to you.

0:11:26.980,0:11:28.980
Thank you.

0:11:28.980,0:11:35.660
What I can say is hold on to God and hold on to the promises of God.

0:11:35.660,0:11:41.760
In the Word of God , it is written that His Word will never change;

0:11:41.760,0:11:43.920
it will stay as it is.

0:11:43.920,0:11:50.540
If He said He will heal us, bless us, indeed He will. Amen.

0:11:50.540,0:11:52.180
Amen.

0:11:52.180,0:11:55.900
Mrs Tendani Nematandani
Morning Water Testimony

0:11:55.900,0:12:00.620
So the Bible itself asked the question, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?"

0:12:00.620,0:12:01.680
[No!]

0:12:01.680,0:12:04.460
So put your trust in Him.

0:12:04.460,0:12:07.640
Amen. It is well, in Jesus' name.

0:12:07.640,0:12:10.820
Amen. It is well.

0:12:10.820,0:12:14.940
Now knowing that it is the Lord who has rescued and delivered you

0:12:14.940,0:12:19.220
and brought about you having this lovely girl in your hands today,

0:12:19.220,0:12:21.820
how are you going to raise and train her?

0:12:21.820,0:12:27.300
I am going to train her towards the way of God.

0:12:27.300,0:12:36.060
That was the reason I said to myself that I should take the baby back and give thanks to God

0:12:36.060,0:12:40.020
as I promised even before I fell pregnant.

0:12:40.020,0:12:45.360
I remember the day that I left The SCOAN, I was telling everyone

0:12:45.360,0:12:53.700
that I was coming back with a testimony and indeed, I have come back with a testimony.

0:12:53.700,0:12:59.100
It is well in the name of Jesus
It is well with my soul today

0:12:59.100,0:13:03.280
The listeners join Mrs Nematandani to praise the Lord Jesus.

0:13:03.280,0:13:09.060
A fitting conclusion to her wonderful testimony of how God has been with her all the way long

0:13:09.060,0:13:15.060
- through challenges and difficulties until she finally received the promise of God.

0:13:15.060,0:13:20.700
Visitors from around the world at The SCOAN, touched by her life experience,

0:13:20.700,0:13:25.760
came forward to see her baby girl and congratulate the joyful mother.

0:13:25.760,0:13:32.140
A few even posed to take a picture together as a reminder of the goodness of God.

0:13:32.140,0:13:34.200
To God be the glory!
