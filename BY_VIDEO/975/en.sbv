GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING

On the 3rd of April 2014, while ministering at The South Korea Pastors' Conference,

0:00:10.960,0:00:18.740
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy concerning a vision God had given him about North and South Korea.

0:00:18.740,0:00:20.800
Here are his words...

0:00:20.800,0:00:26.260
In your country here, whatever threat you are having now is not a threat.

0:00:26.260,0:00:32.880
You people will still come to the table to talk reconciliation between you people and North.

0:00:32.880,0:00:37.000
There is no fight between South and North.

0:00:37.000,0:00:40.820
Whatever threat now, they will still come together and discuss.

0:00:40.820,0:00:48.300
They will not fight but there will be threat, threat, threat.

0:00:48.300,0:00:54.900
There will be threat, threat, threat - gunshot threat - but you people will still discuss.

0:00:54.900,0:00:56.400
There will be reconciliation.

0:00:56.400,0:01:00.060
I am seeing reconciliation coming. Discussion will come.
