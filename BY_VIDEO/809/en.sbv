This woman has come 
to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations

0:00:03.740,0:00:08.420
with the problem of difficulty 
in walking due to rheumatoid arthritis

0:00:08.420,0:00:12.520
and she's using a wheelchair for the past 7 years.

0:00:12.520,0:00:17.420
You can see the bandage tied around her 
knees which she uses to reduce the pain

0:00:17.420,0:00:20.380
she encounters on a daily basis.

0:00:20.380,0:00:25.680
This is the wheelchair she uses every day 
to move from one place to another

0:00:25.680,0:00:28.480
because she cannot walk with her legs.

0:00:28.480,0:00:33.500
Her family members demonstrate the difficult task of carrying her into the wheelchair

0:00:33.500,0:00:36.600
in order to move her around.

0:00:36.600,0:00:41.660
Jesus Christ healed and still heals all manner of sicknesses and diseases.

0:00:41.660,0:00:44.080
Never a sickness, He cannot heal.

0:00:44.080,0:00:46.340
Never a disease, He cannot cure.

0:00:46.340,0:00:48.900
Never a healer like Jesus Christ.

0:00:48.900,0:00:52.120
My name is Diane Ebele Okeke.

0:00:52.120,0:00:55.440
I am from Abuja.

0:00:55.440,0:00:57.600
I'm 30 years old.

0:00:57.600,0:01:01.780
I cannot walk due to rheumatoid arthritis,

0:01:01.780,0:01:04.800
which has affected all of my body

0:01:04.800,0:01:08.120
and I am now confined to a wheelchair.

0:01:08.120,0:01:13.620
I have been having this sickness - rheumatoid arthritis - for the past seven years.

0:01:13.620,0:01:18.400
I have been confined to a wheelchair for the past four years because I cannot walk.

0:01:18.400,0:01:20.980
I have tried all solutions to no avail.

0:01:20.980,0:01:27.560
I have gone to different hospitals, prayer houses, churches, herbalists

0:01:27.560,0:01:29.160
but there was no solution.

0:01:29.160,0:01:33.640
It has affected me to the extent that I cannot do my house chores.

0:01:33.640,0:01:37.520
I have a small baby. I am supposed to nurse my baby ordinarily

0:01:37.520,0:01:40.740
but it is my husband who is helping me to bathe her

0:01:40.740,0:01:44.080
and my sister helps me to feed and take care of her.

0:01:44.080,0:01:48.260
I can't do anything on my own. I can't bathe. I can't even feed.

0:01:48.260,0:01:51.880
I am a graduate and this problem started after my youth service.

0:01:51.880,0:01:54.440
Since that time, I'm not happy

0:01:54.440,0:01:57.080
because I can't do anything on my own.

0:01:57.080,0:01:59.300
I can't even finish my career.

0:01:59.300,0:02:04.240
It started when I was 23 years old - seven years ago. Now, I am 30.

0:02:04.240,0:02:07.000
For the past seven years, I have been at a standstill.

0:02:07.000,0:02:08.640
Nothing - I can't do anything.

0:02:08.640,0:02:16.940
I'm not happy because when I see my age mates and see where they have reached,

0:02:16.940,0:02:19.040
I feel so sad.

0:02:19.040,0:02:21.800
She has come to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations

0:02:21.800,0:02:26.000
with the belief in her heart that with just a touch from Jesus Christ

0:02:26.000,0:02:28.440
through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:02:28.440,0:02:30.720
she will get made holy in Jesus' name.

0:02:30.720,0:02:35.020
Her sister demonstrates how she pushes her from one place to another in the wheelchair

0:02:35.020,0:02:38.620
due to this problem of rheumatoid arthritis.

0:02:38.620,0:02:44.760
I believe that by stepping into this place, the arena of liberty,

0:02:44.760,0:02:47.780
she will be healed. She will not go back the same.

0:02:57.740,0:03:01.960
HEALING TIME

0:03:02.240,0:03:04.740
You're my last hope, Man of God! I am dying!

0:03:04.740,0:03:09.280
For the past seven years, I cannot walk. I have been using a wheelchair for the past four years.

0:03:09.280,0:03:12.280
I'm from Abuja. Man of God, help me! I'm dying!

0:03:12.280,0:03:15.760
I'm too young for this sickness. Man of God, I can't carry my baby.

0:03:15.760,0:03:39.960
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer 
At The SCOAN Saturday Prayer Line In Jesus' Name

0:03:39.960,0:03:45.020
Healing in Jesus' Name

0:03:45.020,0:03:49.040
Healed in Jesus' Name

0:03:49.040,0:03:53.300
Thank You, Jesus!

0:03:53.300,0:04:01.520
Thank You, Jesus, I can walk!

0:04:01.520,0:04:05.240
Healed in Jesus' Name

0:04:05.240,0:04:06.680
My sister can walk now.

0:04:06.680,0:04:09.360
For the past four years, she had been on a wheelchair.

0:04:09.360,0:04:13.920
Thank You, Jesus! She can walk now!

0:04:13.920,0:04:15.800
Thank You, Jesus!

0:04:15.800,0:04:18.420
My name is Diane Ebele Okeke.

0:04:18.420,0:04:21.060
I'm from Abuja.

0:04:21.060,0:04:27.260
I could not walk due to rheutmatoid arthritis for the past seven years.

0:04:27.260,0:04:36.140
I had been to different places - hospitals, native doctors, different churches

0:04:36.140,0:04:40.720
but I could not get a solution until I came to The SCOAN.

0:04:40.720,0:04:44.840
I could not hold anything with my hands or carry my baby.

0:04:44.840,0:04:49.380
I could not to my house chores. My husband had been doing everything for me.

0:04:49.380,0:04:58.100
I could not cook, wash clothes or eat because it affected my gums and teeth.

0:04:58.100,0:05:00.860
Thank You, Jesus, for healing me today!

0:05:00.860,0:05:08.340
I came all the way from Abuja with my sister to The SCOAN.

0:05:08.340,0:05:11.780
I had been using the wheelchair for the past four years.

0:05:11.780,0:05:16.780
My sister introduced me to Emmanuel TV and I have been watching it.

0:05:16.780,0:05:23.500
She told me that we should come to The SCOAN because it was Prophet T.B. Joshua's birthday.

0:05:23.500,0:05:28.280
I had the opportunity to be registered and right now, I can walk.

0:05:28.280,0:05:34.940
I could move, after the man of God touched me.

0:05:34.940,0:05:38.380
I am healed; thank You, Jesus!

0:05:38.380,0:05:40.480
Thank You for healing me today!

0:05:40.480,0:05:46.420
Thank You for using the man of God, T.B. Joshua, to wipe away my tears of seven years.

0:05:46.420,0:05:48.320
Thank You, Jesus!

0:05:48.320,0:05:53.380
For the past four years, I had been on a wheelchair.

0:05:53.380,0:05:57.860
I could not move or do anything.

0:05:57.860,0:06:03.620
After my service, this problem of rheumatoid arthritis started, seven years ago.

0:06:03.620,0:06:07.860
I started having pain all over my body and joints.

0:06:07.860,0:06:10.720
I could not move my hands or fingers.

0:06:10.720,0:06:14.040
Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!

0:06:14.040,0:06:17.220
Thank You, Jesus! My sister has been healed!

0:06:17.220,0:06:19.580
My name is Madu Veronica.

0:06:19.580,0:06:21.720
She is healed now and she can walk.

0:06:21.720,0:06:24.960
She had not been walking for four years.

0:06:24.960,0:06:29.120
This sickness had been holding her down for the past seven years.

0:06:29.120,0:06:33.420
She could not do anything in the house except with the help of her husband.

0:06:33.420,0:06:36.960
Sometimes, when I visited her, I would help out.

0:06:36.960,0:06:42.220
She has a small baby in Abuja that she could not do anything for.

0:06:42.220,0:06:43.980
She could not even breastfeed her.

0:06:43.980,0:06:48.900
We came all the way from Abuja and thank God we came to the arena of liberty

0:06:48.900,0:06:55.180
and she is healed by the prophet of our time.

0:06:55.180,0:06:58.640
She is healed, in the name of Jesus.

0:06:58.920,0:07:02.880
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:07:02.880,0:07:05.760
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:05.760,0:07:08.840
My name is Diane Ebele Okeke.

0:07:08.840,0:07:11.160
I come from Abuja (Nigeria).

0:07:11.160,0:07:17.440
What brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of rheumatoid arthritis,

0:07:17.440,0:07:23.640
which affected my whole body - my joints, neck, legs and knees.

0:07:23.640,0:07:27.160
I could not walk for the past seven years

0:07:27.160,0:07:32.680
and I was confined to a wheelchair for four years.

0:07:32.680,0:07:41.380
I had been to different hospitals from 2009, when I finished my NYSC

0:07:41.380,0:07:43.340
but there was no solution.

0:07:43.340,0:07:48.560
They gave me all kinds of medications and the pain became worse.

0:07:48.560,0:07:53.400
This affected me that I could not conceive anymore.

0:07:53.400,0:08:02.160
All the drugs they gave me did not work; they caused me stomach pain.

0:08:02.160,0:08:06.560
They told me that I would not be able to conceive again.

0:08:06.560,0:08:11.340
I had been praying to God to show me the solution.

0:08:11.340,0:08:15.600
I had been to different hospitals but there was no solution.

0:08:15.600,0:08:22.420
The pain affected me so much that I could not do my house chores or carry my baby;

0:08:22.420,0:08:29.860
even when I gave birth to my baby, it was by the grace of God that I managed to give birth to her.

0:08:29.860,0:08:35.340
After delivering her, I could not breastfeed or carry her.

0:08:35.340,0:08:41.380
My husband helped me to do all the house chores with my sister beside me.

0:08:41.380,0:08:50.620
I could not dress myself or cook; I could not do anything by myself.

0:08:50.620,0:08:54.200
Then, I decided to go to church.

0:08:54.200,0:09:01.740
I went to different churches and prayer houses, all to no avail - no solution.

0:09:01.740,0:09:11.220
My sister called me to say that I should go to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty,

0:09:11.220,0:09:13.620
to finally get my solution.

0:09:13.620,0:09:23.460
We came to The SCOAN from Abuja and the man of God prayed for me.

0:09:23.460,0:09:28.440
Immediately the man of God prayed for me, I felt an electric shock

0:09:28.440,0:09:31.140
and all my whole body began to vibrate.

0:09:31.140,0:09:33.520
I didn't know what was happening

0:09:33.520,0:09:37.380
until he said, "Stand up and walk!"

0:09:37.380,0:09:40.480
I stood up and started walking.

0:09:40.480,0:09:44.380
I don't know how to thank God.

0:09:44.380,0:09:49.540
Come on - you can do better than that! Put your hands together!

0:09:49.540,0:09:51.220
Hallelujah!

0:09:51.220,0:09:53.560
Mrs Diane Ebele Okeke - Healing Testimony

0:09:53.560,0:09:56.840
What a God of miracles!

0:09:56.840,0:09:59.660
Tell your neighbour: What a God of miracles!

0:09:59.660,0:10:01.720
What a God of miracles!

0:10:01.720,0:10:08.000
As a young lady, for the past seven years, since I was 23, I had not been happy.

0:10:08.000,0:10:12.120
But today, I thank God that I can do what I could not do before.

0:10:12.120,0:10:17.060
I am so happy that I can use both of my hands to dress myself again.

0:10:17.060,0:10:21.380
I can eat, unlike before when it affected my teeth and jaw.

0:10:21.380,0:10:24.800
I am so happy that I am healed.

0:10:24.800,0:10:29.300
Amen. Well, indeed, we want to rejoice with you. Can you walk to the glory of God,

0:10:29.300,0:10:31.400
in the midst of the children of God?

0:10:31.400,0:10:34.540
Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus!

0:10:34.540,0:10:36.780
Mrs Diane Ebele Okeke - Healing Testimony

0:10:36.780,0:10:42.260
That is the very lady who received her healing in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:42.260,0:10:46.780
Walking freely to the glory of God!

0:10:46.780,0:10:51.940
My name is Madu Veronica.

0:10:51.940,0:10:55.120
The lady beside me is my sister.

0:10:55.120,0:10:58.760
The man at the other side is our uncle.

0:10:58.760,0:11:02.740
The problem started seven years ago.

0:11:02.740,0:11:11.620
She called me on the phone and said that both knees were hurting her.

0:11:11.620,0:11:19.420
It thought it was a normal pain until, as time went on, the pain got worse.

0:11:19.420,0:11:24.460
It affected all her joints and her whole body.

0:11:24.460,0:11:31.660
She could not do anything by herself, except with the help of her husband, house help

0:11:31.660,0:11:35.320
or me, whenever I had the chance.

0:11:35.320,0:11:40.980
It affected her so seriously that she could not even bathe herself.

0:11:40.980,0:11:48.000
I knew that immediately she would step on this land, she would not go back the same.

0:11:48.000,0:11:53.160
Mrs Madu Veronica (Diane's Sister) - Healing Testimony

0:11:53.160,0:12:05.440
We had gone to various churches, hospitals and herbalists but no solution was found.

0:12:05.440,0:12:11.620
In fact, people of God, I used to watch these things on Emmanuel TV.

0:12:11.620,0:12:15.440
This is our first time of coming here.

0:12:15.440,0:12:19.360
Yesterday, I was right behind her, looking at her.

0:12:19.360,0:12:23.560
The man of God prayed for her and touched her.

0:12:23.560,0:12:26.940
The next thing I saw was that she started vibrating.

0:12:26.940,0:12:30.760
I was so joyous and happy.

0:12:30.760,0:12:37.600
I want to tell you that yesterday, when we got home, she started sleeping.

0:12:37.600,0:12:44.680
She slept like a baby from 7pm, when we got to our hotel, till 9am.

0:12:44.680,0:12:48.320
This is something she could not do before.

0:12:48.320,0:12:51.380
This morning, I was expecting her to call me

0:12:51.380,0:12:58.280
but I had told myself that if she called me to help her put on her clothes, I would not.

0:12:58.280,0:13:04.860
Fortunately, she did not call me because she dressed herself. I thank God!

0:13:04.860,0:13:06.880
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:13:06.880,0:13:11.320
Testimony Time

0:13:11.320,0:13:14.140
Madam, what can you say concerning this miracle?

0:13:14.140,0:13:19.200
How can you describe the miracle that took place in the life of your sister?

0:13:19.200,0:13:21.700
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:13:21.700,0:13:27.740
I told my sister, "Let's go to the arena of liberty".

0:13:27.740,0:13:39.000
I want to tell you that Prophet T.B. Joshua is the prophet of our time.

0:13:39.000,0:13:44.460
With what I saw yesterday, I am so happy.

0:13:44.460,0:13:54.720
It's real; it's not magic, it's not rocket science - it happened live.

0:13:54.720,0:13:58.000
You experienced it live and direct.

0:13:58.000,0:14:03.220
It happened in the life of your family; indeed, it happened in the life of your sister

0:14:03.220,0:14:07.520
and you witnessed first-hand that Jesus Christ is real.

0:14:07.520,0:14:12.580
He is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:14:12.580,0:14:17.440
Right now, we want to hear from your sister once more.

0:14:17.440,0:14:20.980
How is your body now? Are you still experiencing those pains that you had before?

0:14:20.980,0:14:24.460
No, I'm free; I can do what I could not do before.

0:14:24.460,0:14:30.700
I can raise my leg, I can shake my body and neck; I can do everything I could not do before.

0:14:30.700,0:14:34.580
Oh, hallelujah! Clap for Jesus!

0:14:34.580,0:14:37.540
Testimony Time

0:14:37.540,0:14:43.560
Indeed, whom the Son of God sets free is free indeed!

0:14:43.560,0:14:48.940
I want to advise the whole world, especially young people,

0:14:48.940,0:14:57.680
suffering with this kind of pain or sickness that has confined them to a wheelchair.

0:14:57.680,0:15:01.100
They should be patient and wait for God's time.

0:15:01.100,0:15:07.280
I never knew I would walk again as medical people had told me I would not walk again.

0:15:07.280,0:15:11.480
I want to advise them to be patient and trust in God.

0:15:11.480,0:15:14.900
One day, He will surely answer them.

0:15:14.900,0:15:16.880
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:15:16.880,0:15:21.980
Indeed, God is with us. Let's clap for Jesus!

0:15:21.980,0:15:26.960
Wonderful advice: Be patient and wait for God's time.

0:15:26.960,0:15:30.860
