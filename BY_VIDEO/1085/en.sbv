It's alright.

0:00:03.280,0:00:07.740
During a Sunday service, there is a seeming distraction in the congregation.

0:00:07.740,0:00:11.140
We can see here, a young man creating a scene.

0:00:11.140,0:00:13.900
Brother!

0:00:13.900,0:00:16.220
Please take it easy.

0:00:16.220,0:00:21.120
Come. What's wrong? Come.

0:00:21.120,0:00:25.960
I want to get married, I am not yet married.

0:00:25.960,0:00:27.080
You want to get married?

0:00:27.080,0:00:27.820
Yes, sir.

0:00:27.820,0:00:29.200
And you are not yet married?

0:00:29.200,0:00:30.400
Yes, sir.

0:00:30.400,0:00:33.360
What a handsome man! Come.

0:00:33.360,0:00:43.400
He says, he wants to get married and he is not yet married - very handsome man. Don't worry.

0:00:43.400,0:00:47.400
Take one.

Go and wait for me. Okay? You will come back and give testimony here.

0:00:59.660,0:01:08.140
Somebody says he wants to get married and you are blocking him.

TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:12.540,0:01:19.440

Testimony Time

0:01:24.640,0:01:36.680
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:36.680,0:01:40.200
Good Morning!

0:01:40.200,0:01:52.240
My name is Deacon Prince Uche Anazodo, and this is my wife. My beautiful Pina pina.

0:01:52.240,0:02:02.180
Her name is Princess Kenechi Vivian Anazodo. Praise the Lord!

0:02:02.180,0:02:10.480
You have already seen the clips. It was a terrible situation.

0:02:10.480,0:02:22.820
Before I came  to the SCOAN, I had this challenge of not being able to get married.

0:02:22.820,0:02:34.400
It was not ordinary. It was a challenge. It was a demonic conception.

0:02:34.400,0:02:41.460
I am a deacon, I had a challenge, inspite of my church commitment and what have you.

0:02:41.460,0:02:47.220
The time I intended to get married, I discovered that I couldn't get married.

0:02:47.220,0:02:58.160
It's either, I like the woman, she doesn't like me; or she likes me and I would not be able to like her.

0:02:58.160,0:03:02.660
And even if she likes me and I like her, it will not work.

0:03:02.660,0:03:09.560
And a scenario, the lady in question died. It was so terrible! In fact, as a matter of fact,

0:03:09.560,0:03:15.620
it came to a point, my father - though he is late now - took it as a point of duty

0:03:15.620,0:03:23.600
to make me get married. In fact, he took me to a lady. At a point he said "My son, you have to get married."

0:03:23.600,0:03:29.340
It was like an embarrassment. And you know, at a point I was downcased.

0:03:29.340,0:03:35.580
I had a lot of thoughts in me - suicidal and what have you.

0:03:35.580,0:03:44.100
But I remembered, there was a man, a man of God in the person of Prophet T.B. Joshua, the Senior Prophet.

0:03:44.100,0:03:50.760
Prince Uche and Princess Kenechi Anazodo - Prophesy Testimony

0:03:50.760,0:03:59.280
I took a decision to go to the pilgrimage. You know, here is a pilgrimage, here it's not just a church setting.

0:03:59.280,0:04:03.040
To have an encounter with the Man of God.

0:04:03.040,0:04:15.920
And when I came - the church was actually winding up, and the Man of God in the Synagogue

0:04:15.920,0:04:23.320
was not looking at my direction. I said: "Wow". I said: "No, I can't go here empty handed."

0:04:23.320,0:04:31.840
I said: "God, You have to help me because I know what it takes

0:04:31.840,0:04:36.340
to see the Man of God without him inviting you."

0:04:36.340,0:04:41.460
So I prayed a simple prayer. I said: "Lord, have Your way."

0:04:41.460,0:04:50.800
And from what you saw in the clips; I stood up, the ushers came running around me,

0:04:50.800,0:04:57.000
but God had to intervene because my case was desperate.

0:04:57.000,0:05:02.820
My case was different. Emmanuel!

0:05:02.820,0:05:12.420
So, when he beckoned on me, and he asked me: "Young man, what's the problem?"

0:05:12.420,0:05:22.300
I told him: "I want to get married. But I discovered that it was not ordinary. My own case is not an ordinary case."

0:05:22.300,0:05:27.660
He now said, very simple. He said I will come back and give my testimony.

0:05:27.660,0:05:36.880
I said: "So simple!" So when I went back, God is a good Arrenger.

0:05:36.880,0:05:48.620
So He had to arrange me. And gave me the favour.

0:05:48.620,0:05:56.440
Actually, I am an engineer, I install, supply dishes and what have you, CCTV camera and what have you.

0:05:56.440,0:06:04.620
So I got an arrangement and I started working in the palace,

0:06:04.620,0:06:16.320
of the King of my town. So when I started working there it now happened that... It was on a certain day,

0:06:16.320,0:06:21.900
one wonderful day.

0:06:21.900,0:06:30.760
Her Majesty called me, she said they have a challenge. I should come and know what is happening,

0:06:30.760,0:06:40.180
what was the problem. So I went there, and before you could say...

0:06:40.180,0:06:52.440
I saw my wife now passing by. I said: "Who is this person?"

0:06:52.440,0:06:58.320
They said,  it is the daughter of the King, the daughter of Igwe. I said: "Ah!"

0:06:58.320,0:07:04.920
Prince Uche & Princess Kenechi Anazodo - Prophecy Testimony

0:07:04.920,0:07:09.260
So, I now went to her, I approached her. I introduced myself.

0:07:09.260,0:07:14.600
And she now introduced herself. She just graduated, she came back trying to prepare

0:07:14.600,0:07:22.660
for her Youth Service. So we now started talking and we exchanged our phone numbers.

0:07:22.660,0:07:27.500
She said that since I'm into installation of satellite dishes and what have you,

0:07:27.500,0:07:41.960
when she gets where she is posted, she would want me to come and install a satellite dish for her.

0:07:41.960,0:07:47.720
That was how it begun, and before we knew it, it now came from installing of satellite dish

0:07:47.720,0:07:56.180
to installation for marriage.

0:07:56.180,0:08:07.860
And before you know it, it was an installation of pregnancy.

0:08:07.860,0:08:23.380
The God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua is the authentic, autocratic, authoritative, automatical.

0:08:23.380,0:08:31.860
God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is the God, that is beyond human comprehension.

0:08:31.860,0:08:36.120
The impossibility Specialist.

0:08:36.120,0:08:40.240
The God that knows the ending from the beginning.

0:08:40.240,0:08:45.420
I want to give Him all the Glory! He is worthy. Hallelujah!

0:08:45.420,0:08:51.540
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:08:51.540,0:08:56.520
And brother, we want to ask you; when you came to the SCOAN and had this encounter

0:08:56.520,0:09:01.400
with Prophet T.B. Joshua, when you returned home, what was the reaction of people who saw you

0:09:01.400,0:09:06.340
on Emmanuel TV crying out? What did they tell you when you went home?

0:09:06.340,0:09:12.940
Actually when I went home, they were laughing at me. My friends, they were saying

0:09:12.940,0:09:20.780
I went to the Synagogue to eat apple. Where is the woman?

0:09:20.780,0:09:29.060
It was not an easy, it was not an easy encounter. I was like: "Wow".

0:09:29.060,0:09:35.960
But today this is my woman. You can see her live and direct. Hallelujah!

0:09:35.960,0:09:40.960
Amen! Lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:09:40.960,0:09:45.940
And brother, we can see some pictures on the board there. Could  you describe to us what we are seeing here.

0:09:45.940,0:09:51.340
This is my court wedding certificate.

0:09:51.340,0:09:55.940
This is my white wedding certificate.

0:09:55.940,0:10:05.240
This is my court wedding. You can see me here. This is my pina pina, my wife.

0:10:05.240,0:10:09.160
This is the court wedding.

0:10:09.160,0:10:15.020
This is the church wedding. You can see me here. This is my pina pina, my princess.

0:10:15.020,0:10:22.500
This is the church event.

0:10:22.500,0:10:32.800
Let me introduce my father in law to you. This is Igwe Doctor K.O.N. Orizu.

0:10:32.800,0:10:38.380
The Igwe Nnewi and this is the daughter.

0:10:38.380,0:10:44.580
This is the Igwe Orizo III,

0:10:44.580,0:10:52.780
Igwe Doctor K.N.O Orizo III. Igwe Nnewi Traditional ruler of Nnewi Kingdom.

0:10:52.780,0:10:58.080
Ordinarily there was no way I could have gotten married to the daughter of Igwe,

0:10:58.080,0:11:07.760
if not of God's intervention through the Prophet himself, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:11:07.760,0:11:10.480
Amen! Lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:11:10.480,0:11:17.100
This is the traditional wedding. In fact, I am overwhelmed. I am overgusted, I am overwhelmed.

0:11:17.100,0:11:18.500
Glory to God Almighty.

0:11:18.500,0:11:24.000
And since you got married you have enjoyed peace and love in this marriage and the curse that didn't want

0:11:24.000,0:11:26.960
you to get married has truly been broken.

0:11:26.960,0:11:37.260
Actually, my wife here, my wonderful, beautiful, joyful princess,

0:11:37.260,0:11:43.760
since I got married to her, I have been enjoying peace. Very humble, as you see her,

0:11:43.760,0:11:47.380
she is very humble to the core. Very down to earth.

0:11:47.380,0:11:56.420
You know, just like my father in the Lord Prophet T.B. Joshua, humble.

0:11:56.420,0:12:00.720
So I want to give God the Glory. She is wonderful woman, very peaceful.

0:12:00.720,0:12:02.980
She doesn't want trouble, she doesn't like trouble.

0:12:02.980,0:12:08.200
And the family is a wonderful family. It is wonderful family. It was through divine arrangement;

0:12:08.200,0:12:14.640
because everything was divinely arranged.

0:12:14.640,0:12:19.380
You can't imagine me getting married to the daughter of Igwe. It's not possible.

0:12:19.380,0:12:29.060
It's not. Naturally, there is no way. "Who dash Monkey Banana."

0:12:29.060,0:12:34.620
Indeed, this is divine arrangement, and we give all the Glory to God Almighty,

0:12:34.620,0:12:38.120
for what He has done in the life of our brother here.

0:12:38.120,0:12:43.780
And do you mean to say, sir, that in your family you have been facing this problem of not being able to get married?

0:12:43.780,0:12:48.800
This has been a curse in the family but that curse has been broken, through your coming here?

0:12:48.800,0:12:53.520
Yes, it was actually a curse. I am the only son. You know what that means.

0:12:53.520,0:12:59.200
If you have an only son, and your only son is not able to get married - you know what that means.

0:12:59.200,0:13:05.480
That means the lineage is going. And when I knew it,

0:13:05.480,0:13:17.420
I knew it was not a church thing. You have to go to seek the face of the field marshal.

0:13:17.420,0:13:21.780
You need to seek the face of the faith marshal. We have generals actually, 

0:13:21.780,0:13:27.100
but we have a field martial. And I had to go and seek the face of the field marshal

0:13:27.100,0:13:32.820
in the person of senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:13:32.820,0:13:36.240
Amen! And today we can see the results in the life of our brother.

0:13:36.240,0:13:41.160
Right now we want hear a quick word from your wife as well before coming back to hear you advice.

0:13:41.160,0:13:48.920
Emmanuel! My name is Princess Kenechi Vivian Anazodo.

0:13:48.920,0:13:52.840
When we were about to get married, it was a surprise to everybody.

0:13:52.840,0:13:59.680
People were like: "Are you sure this daughter of Igwe and all that?" In fact, they said many things,

0:13:59.680,0:14:06.240
But thank God. One thing I know that with God everything is possible.

0:14:06.240,0:14:09.140
Glory be to God, and today you are happily married to your husband.

0:14:09.140,0:14:12.900
And you have listened to this wonderful testimony. What can you say about what God has done?

0:14:12.900,0:14:17.280
God is a marvelous God. He is indeed wonderful. Thank you, Jesus.

0:14:17.280,0:14:21.960
Finally, brother, we would like to hear your word of advice to our viewers all over the world

0:14:21.960,0:14:24.220
in the light of this wonderful testimony.

0:14:24.220,0:14:33.980
Praise the Lord. I would like to use this opportunity to advice my Christian brothers.

0:14:33.980,0:14:42.460
Praise the Lord. It's good to be in a denomination but when you now discover that your case

0:14:42.460,0:14:53.040
has now become a chronic case, please my brothers, my sisters - run down to the SCOAN.

0:14:53.040,0:14:58.940
Run down to the SCOAN to have an encounter. This is not a church thing.

0:14:58.940,0:15:04.780
God is not interested in you being a church member. Praise the Lord!

0:15:04.780,0:15:11.240
God is interested in you having an encounter with destiny and this is the place of destiny.

0:15:11.240,0:15:18.260
Praise the Lord! This is pilgrimage ground. People go to Israel for pilgrimage.

0:15:18.260,0:15:24.640
Please run down here, this is pilgrimage ground. When you come here, you have an encounter with your destiny.

0:15:24.640,0:15:30.320
If you are not able to get married, just as I was, you are going to come back

0:15:30.320,0:15:35.660
with your wife to share the testimony in this place, in the name of Jesus.

0:15:35.660,0:15:40.700
Amen. Lets put our hands for Jesus Christ!

0:15:40.700,0:15:44.960
Thank you, Jesus Christ! And we heard it all from our brother. We know that our membership

0:15:44.960,0:15:51.380
at our local church is merely symbolic. What counts is Christ in us, the Hope of Glory.

0:15:51.380,0:15:55.180
And we believe that as Christians we are all one in the body of Christ.

0:15:55.180,0:15:58.640
On the last day when we stand before Jesus, the question will not be:

0:15:58.640,0:16:01.600
"Did you worship in this church or worship in this denomination?"

0:16:01.600,0:16:07.160
But the question will be: "Did you worship in Spirit and in Truth?"

0:16:07.160,0:16:10.740
And we thank God for what he has done in the life of this couple and we believe more and more

0:16:10.740,0:16:14.060
testimonies are on the way. As Prophet T.B Joshua says - better is not good enough

0:16:14.060,0:16:22.200
the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name. Lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:16:22.200,0:16:24.200
