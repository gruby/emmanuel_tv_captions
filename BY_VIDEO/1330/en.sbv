0:00:00.000,0:00:03.720
Thank you. Good Morning!

0:00:03.720,0:00:06.340
You may be seated, thank you!

0:00:06.340,0:00:09.760
Hallelujah!

0:00:09.760,0:00:13.720
Glory be to God.

0:00:13.720,0:00:20.640
I'm here to give you just a short word of exhortation.

0:00:20.640,0:00:26.360
You know God is working out the answer.

0:00:26.360,0:00:33.400
You remember the message given to you concerning reporting which is very important

0:00:33.400,0:00:39.580
and I know you are doing what the Word says.

0:00:39.580,0:00:45.260
It's an issue that will really help you in your domestic affairs, your company

0:00:45.260,0:00:47.580
and everywhere you find yourself.

0:00:47.580,0:00:53.880
The Bible says salvation is of confession and believing

0:00:53.880,0:01:00.980
so you must know that reporting should be an expression of believing.

0:01:00.980,0:01:06.960
Reporting should be an expression of believing.

0:01:06.960,0:01:14.800
Wherever you find yourself as a Christian, you are to report what you see.

0:01:14.800,0:01:28.360
As a Christian, wherever you find yourself, you are to report what you see and hear.

0:01:28.360,0:01:37.460
When you report what you see and what you hear, it settles issues, it answers questions,

0:01:37.460,0:01:45.520
it clarifies doubts and provides a way forward.

0:01:45.520,0:01:52.840
Work alone cannot help any establishment grow.

0:01:52.840,0:02:01.360
Every establishment expects two things from you: working and reporting.

0:02:01.360,0:02:02.500
I can't hear you.

0:02:02.500,0:02:04.940
[Working and reporting.]

0:02:04.940,0:02:07.820
Today you are here in the church.

0:02:07.820,0:02:18.060
You are to report whatever you see that is wrong among the workers and the members.

0:02:18.060,0:02:19.820
Don't just leave.

0:02:19.820,0:02:23.280
"No, no. Look at the way the woman behaved."

0:02:23.280,0:02:26.760
You know when we were in the church, the woman was disturbing.

0:02:26.760,0:02:29.820
Discussing this at home is a sin.

0:02:29.820,0:02:34.040
You have to report it in church; you have to write it down and give it to the usher,

0:02:34.040,0:02:38.520
"Please, I'm giving you this. Make sure you submit it to the authority".

0:02:38.520,0:02:42.880
You have to be vigilant of what is going on.

0:02:42.880,0:02:47.000
"Look at that woman. From this group to another group.

0:02:47.000,0:02:51.300
Look at her moving around. Why is she talking like that? See the way she moves!"

0:02:51.300,0:02:55.660
"See the way he passes a note! A worker!"

0:02:55.660,0:03:01.800
You have to report.

0:03:01.800,0:03:03.540
Hallelujah.

0:03:03.540,0:03:06.540
That is very important.

0:03:06.540,0:03:16.640
Reporting should be an expression of believing.

0:03:16.640,0:03:19.880
Unruly behaviours.

0:03:19.880,0:03:28.400
Not only that: the visions you have about your establishment, dreams.

0:03:28.400,0:03:31.900
There are many visions and dreams you often have.

0:03:31.900,0:03:34.260
God will show you.

0:03:34.260,0:03:37.200
You have to send a letter or a mail.

0:03:37.200,0:03:40.840
You can even because of that travel from your country to another country -

0:03:40.840,0:03:46.180
just because of that vision because you are a believer.

0:03:46.180,0:03:49.280
Hallelujah!

0:03:49.280,0:03:59.500
I'm thanking you for your prayer because God has spoken, regardless of our situations.

0:03:59.500,0:04:01.580
Hallelujah!

0:04:01.580,0:04:03.380
Rise up for prayer.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:08.220,0:04:16.360
If you honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word,

0:04:16.360,0:04:26.920
you will discover that there is a spirit of unforgiveness, a spirit of anger,

0:04:26.920,0:04:39.080
a spirit of bitterness, a spirit of jealousy, a spirit of envy

0:04:39.080,0:04:47.360
and such a spirit break our communion with God, our relationship with God.

0:04:47.360,0:04:53.360
It opens the door to whatever situation you are in now.

0:04:53.360,0:04:56.220
You say, "I have sickness".

0:04:56.220,0:05:01.020
What is the route of sickness? Unforgiveness.

0:05:01.020,0:05:07.300
Hardship - what is the route of hardship? Envy, jealousy and anger.

0:05:07.300,0:05:12.060
That is the route, the road to get to you.

0:05:12.060,0:05:22.140
Nightmare, barrenness, anger, jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness - these are routes.

0:05:22.140,0:05:28.940
You will see many people you have put in the prison yard and you are still walking everywhere.

0:05:28.940,0:05:34.240
You will see people that are in bondage just because of you.

0:05:34.240,0:05:36.380
Are you talking of divorce?

0:05:36.380,0:05:39.860
Many men you have divorced; many women you have divorced.

0:05:39.860,0:05:44.720
You say, "Over your life, the woman will not see the children!"

0:05:44.720,0:05:48.220
What is your problem?

0:05:48.220,0:05:51.780
Why will the woman not see her children; why will the man not see his children?

0:05:51.780,0:05:56.600
You have divorced him or her.

0:05:56.600,0:06:00.480
And you are calling, "God, God!" - for what?

0:06:00.480,0:06:03.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:03.900,0:06:05.760
You people have divorced.

0:06:05.760,0:06:09.180
You say, "The man will not see the children again!"

0:06:09.180,0:06:13.760
and you are trying to keep these children away from the man or the woman.

0:06:13.760,0:06:18.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:18.760,0:06:28.160
"Father, forgive them" - both accused and accuser.

0:06:28.160,0:06:33.240
"Father, forgive them" - both wrong and right.

0:06:33.240,0:06:37.660
You say it is witchcraft, they bewitched you, they attacked you.

0:06:37.660,0:06:39.460
Who attacked you?

0:06:39.460,0:06:45.260
When you are carrying an unforgiving spirit, envy and jealousy, you say they attacked you.

0:06:45.260,0:06:49.180
You don't need to be attacked; once you have that spirit, you have attacked yourself.

0:06:49.180,0:06:52.060
Are you there?

0:06:52.060,0:06:54.600
Listen to me again.

0:06:54.600,0:07:05.360
It opens the door to whatever challenges you are in.

0:07:05.360,0:07:13.600
Are you sick, facing hardship, poverty, loneliness, rejection?

0:07:13.600,0:07:23.300
Whatever you are facing, the route of those things is unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, bitterness.

0:07:23.300,0:07:25.160
These are the routes.

0:07:25.160,0:07:31.040
You don't need the enemy to attack you; once you have these, you have attacked yourself.

0:07:31.040,0:07:34.240
Once the relationship is broken, what else again?

0:07:34.240,0:07:36.900
You are accessible to satan.

0:07:36.900,0:07:40.800
It breaks the communion; it breaks the relationship.

0:07:40.800,0:07:43.140
These are the things that break the relationship.

0:07:43.140,0:07:47.920
Once your relationship breaks with God, what else again? You are on your own.

0:07:47.920,0:07:58.160
Unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, bitterness, strife and hatred

0:07:58.160,0:08:07.240
open the door to whatever you are in.

0:08:07.240,0:08:10.100
When you leave here now, it is not too late.

0:08:10.100,0:08:14.400
Just from your heart, you can say, "Yes, what this man says, I am ready".

0:08:14.400,0:08:20.740
Once you say you are ready and you concur in your heart, the job is done.

0:08:20.740,0:08:26.240
When you leave here, you can continue to reconcile, send a test message,

0:08:26.240,0:08:31.060
a phone call and try to settle yourself.

0:08:31.060,0:08:37.800
I release you from the pain of the past.

0:08:37.800,0:08:45.620
I release you from the unforgiving spirit, that bitterness, envy, jealousy.

0:08:45.620,0:08:51.520
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:08:51.520,0:08:53.520
You know you can be released.

0:08:53.520,0:08:56.580
You know that?

0:08:56.580,0:09:05.580
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:05.580,0:09:15.520
Such spirits break the communion, relationship with God.

0:09:15.520,0:09:20.380
Once it breaks, you are on your own.

0:09:20.380,0:09:26.040
Once you are on your own, here is poverty; here is affliction.

0:09:26.040,0:09:30.340
Once you are on your own, here is hardship.

0:09:30.340,0:09:33.420
Once you are on your own, here is rejection.

0:09:33.420,0:09:40.800
Once you are on your own, here is nightmare.

0:09:40.800,0:09:50.500
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves.

0:09:50.500,0:10:05.300
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves, heals, blesses and delivers.

0:10:05.300,0:10:10.040
You say, "I am healed!" You are about to lose that healing with that unforgiving spirit.

0:10:10.040,0:10:14.120
You are about to lose that deliverance with that unforgiving spirit,

0:10:14.120,0:10:19.800
with bitterness, envy and jealousy in your heart.

0:10:19.800,0:10:27.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:27.140,0:10:35.940
You can receive deliverance but with an unforgiving spirit, you will lose it.

0:10:35.940,0:10:43.800
With that unforgiving spirit, envy and jealousy in your heart, that cannot be permanent.

0:10:43.800,0:10:46.860
This is why our life is epileptic.

0:10:46.860,0:10:51.280
It goes this way; later down.

0:10:51.280,0:10:55.220
This way - down.

0:10:55.220,0:10:59.520
And you keep asking yourself why all this is not with you forever.

0:10:59.520,0:11:01.340
It can be forever.

0:11:01.340,0:11:04.340
You are healed forever; you are blessed forever.

0:11:04.340,0:11:08.680
It is a paste-tense victory but because of an unforgiving spirit,

0:11:08.680,0:11:19.000
envy, jealousy, bitterness and hatred in you, that cannot be permanent.

0:11:19.000,0:11:23.060
As you are standing, begin to examine yourself, "What is wrong?

0:11:23.060,0:11:25.900
What is the next thing now?"

0:11:25.900,0:11:31.460
It is better not to receive than to receive and lose it.

0:11:31.460,0:11:38.060
Ask yourself, "What is wrong with me?

0:11:38.060,0:11:42.900
Why is my life not constant?

0:11:42.900,0:11:45.920
I'm happy now - another time...

0:11:45.920,0:11:48.220
I'm blessed - another time...

0:11:48.220,0:11:52.240
Why?"

0:11:52.240,0:11:55.400
Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:11:55.400,0:11:58.160
His blessing is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:11:58.160,0:12:00.820
His healing is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:12:00.820,0:12:02.820
"Why all this?"

0:12:02.820,0:12:07.120
"Why?"

0:12:07.120,0:12:13.600
How can you labour, sweat and suddenly you are back to square one again?

MESSAGE TITLE: BELIEVE AND CONFESS | PART 3

0:12:19.660,0:12:28.280
You are here today because you see the strength of God - from strength to strength.

0:12:28.280,0:12:35.840
That is why you are here - irrespective of tribulation, persecution, hatred.

0:12:35.840,0:12:50.920
Strength to strength - that is why you are here, irrespective of name-calling.

0:12:50.920,0:12:55.460
When you expect something to spoil and it is not spoiled, you will join them.

0:12:55.460,0:13:00.620
When you expect something to destroy and it refuses to destroy, you will join them.

0:13:00.620,0:13:05.360
When you expect something to disappear and it refuses to disappear, you will join them.

0:13:05.360,0:13:07.220
That is why you are here today.

0:13:07.220,0:13:17.840
Honestly examine your heart; Christianity lies in the heart.

0:13:17.840,0:13:21.780
Tell your neighbour, "Christianity lies in the heart".

0:13:21.780,0:13:25.540
You see this appearance - it is a camouflage.

0:13:25.540,0:13:28.620
Your make-up, your hair, your beauty, you are handsome -

0:13:28.620,0:13:36.880
this appearance is a camouflage; the real man is your heart.

0:13:36.880,0:13:43.020
This is why the Bible says faith is of man's heart.

0:13:43.020,0:13:52.420
The one that worships God is your heart, not your body.

0:13:52.420,0:13:53.920
Listen again!

0:13:53.920,0:14:02.620
Honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word, without prejudice.

0:14:02.620,0:14:12.260
Honestly examine your heart and you will find that your heart is full of an unforgiving spirit,

0:14:12.260,0:14:20.440
bitterness, envy and jealousy.

0:14:20.440,0:14:25.840
"Forgive us as we forgive others" - is that not the promise?

0:14:25.840,0:14:29.700
"Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us."

0:14:29.700,0:14:31.700
So, why have an unforgiving spirit?

0:14:31.700,0:14:34.920
Why bitterness? Why envy? Why jealousy?

0:14:34.920,0:14:39.940
You are what God says you are. Why compare yourself to others?

0:14:39.940,0:14:42.220
Why measuring yourself with others?

0:14:42.220,0:14:43.380
Why?

0:14:43.380,0:14:52.200
"No, look, I'm too fat. I need to be slim. Look at that one - he is very slim."

0:14:52.200,0:14:55.380
You have gone to the car park; you have examined many cars there.

0:14:55.380,0:14:58.300
You say, "Ah, I see this car - I must get my own."

0:14:58.300,0:15:01.860
You would do anything to get your own.

0:15:01.860,0:15:07.000
Honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word;

0:15:07.000,0:15:13.820
you will see a heart holding grudges, envy and jealousy.

0:15:13.820,0:15:17.520

Someone was asking me four days ago,

0:16:51.200,0:16:58.860
"Sir, am I a real person God wants me to be?"

0:16:58.860,0:17:02.060
I asked, "What is the meaning of this grammar?

0:17:02.060,0:17:06.600
What do you mean by 'Am I a real person God wants me to be'?"

0:17:06.600,0:17:12.340
He said, "Because..." - he realised that he doesn't know how to go forward again.

0:17:12.340,0:17:13.740
He is a Christian.

0:17:13.740,0:17:23.260
"You said you are a Christian and you are saying this. This is blaspheming."

If you want to be the person God wants you to be, if you want to know your destiny,

0:17:40.520,0:17:47.960
you need to know God better.

0:17:47.960,0:17:51.140
Get to know God better.

0:17:51.140,0:17:59.360
The way you know God - you know God by the senses, by your eyes.

0:17:59.360,0:18:02.720
"Yes, this is true."

0:18:02.720,0:18:05.020
"This is this; this is that."

0:18:05.020,0:18:10.420
By what you see, you know God; by what you hear, you know God;

0:18:10.420,0:18:17.400
by what you touch, you know God; feeling - you know God.

0:18:17.400,0:18:20.360
He was asking me, "What do I mean by knowing God better?"

0:18:20.360,0:18:25.240
I said, "You know God better - you know God by your senses".

0:18:25.240,0:18:27.620
He said, "Yes, yes".

0:18:27.620,0:18:30.720
"Ok, if you say you know God beyond your senses,

0:18:30.720,0:18:35.820
can you tell me - I'm here now - what are you looking at?"

0:18:35.820,0:18:38.340
He said, he sees T.B. Joshua, he sees my hand, my nose.

0:18:38.340,0:18:39.840
"No, no, no.

0:18:39.840,0:18:48.180
If you know people around me here, you know I'm a camouflage.

0:18:48.180,0:18:52.080
The face you are seeing is a camouflage."

0:18:52.080,0:19:03.000
To know the person God wants you to be, to know your destiny, you need to know God better.

0:19:03.000,0:19:04.100
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:04.100,0:19:07.960
[To know the person God wants you to be, to know your destiny, you need to know God better.]

0:19:07.960,0:19:09.040
I can't hear you.

0:19:09.040,0:19:12.660
[To know the person God wants you to be, to know your destiny, you need to know God better.]

0:19:12.660,0:19:14.220
You know God - no doubt.

0:19:14.220,0:19:16.140
But you need to know God better.

0:19:16.140,0:19:18.140
You say, you know God.

0:19:18.140,0:19:23.600
By senses - what you see, hear - that is how you know God.

0:19:23.600,0:19:29.220
This is carrot, this is fruit, this is this, this is that.

0:19:29.220,0:19:32.260
Beyond this carrot - you cannot see beyond.

0:19:32.260,0:19:34.260
Beyond T.B. Joshua - you cannot see.

0:19:34.260,0:19:39.820
All you see is T.B. Joshua, he is holding a mic - that's all.

0:19:39.820,0:19:54.880
You need to know God better by discovering your spiritual gifts.

0:19:54.880,0:20:02.360
The Bible says no one can say "Jesus is Lord," except by the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:20:02.360,0:20:07.300
God is Spirit and His worshippers worship Him in Spirit and truth.

0:20:07.300,0:20:11.520
How can you worship God without the Spirit of God?

0:20:11.520,0:20:16.040
How can you know your destiny without the Spirit of God?

0:20:16.040,0:20:20.240
No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:20:20.240,0:20:25.000
Without your spiritual gift, you are zero.

0:20:25.000,0:20:29.200
Without your spiritual gift, you will continue to worship God by the senses -

0:20:29.200,0:20:39.880
what you see, what you hear, what you feel, what your emotions say, what your feelings say.

0:20:39.880,0:20:49.480
You cannot become God's person on the history and theory about the Word of God.

0:20:49.480,0:20:50.500
Tell your neighbour.

0:20:50.500,0:21:00.880
You cannot become God's person on the history and theory about the Word of God.

0:21:00.880,0:21:04.500
This is what makes you a child of God, a born again.

0:21:04.500,0:21:08.540
History and theory about the Word of God, that makes you - no!

0:21:08.540,0:21:15.580
You cannot become God’s person on the history and theory about the Word of God alone.

0:21:15.580,0:21:22.080
Indeed, it is valuable but alone - history and theory of the Bible -

0:21:22.080,0:21:25.660
you cannot just call your spiritual gift.

0:21:25.660,0:21:42.680
I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!

0:21:42.680,0:21:47.100
Be healed, in the name of Jesus!

0:21:47.100,0:21:49.520
Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:21:49.520,0:21:52.180
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:21:52.180,0:21:58.260
God has spoken, in Jesus' name!

0:21:58.260,0:21:59.260
I can't hear you!

0:21:59.260,0:22:01.260
[Amen!]

0:22:01.260,0:22:05.600
I can sense God's healing touching you.

0:22:05.600,0:22:15.200
I can sense God's deliverance touching you, in Jesus' name!

0:22:15.200,0:22:19.000
Hear this: God has spoken!

0:22:19.000,0:22:20.760
Rejoice!

0:22:20.760,0:22:27.060
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:22:27.060,0:22:30.660
Don't forget the message for you.

0:22:30.660,0:22:40.020
The spirit of unforgiveness, anger, bitterness breaks the communion with God,

0:22:40.020,0:22:42.780
breaks relationship with God

0:22:42.780,0:22:48.440
and once that relationship is broken, you are on your own.

0:22:48.440,0:22:57.520
Those spirits - malice, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred, unforgiveness -

0:22:57.520,0:23:00.120
you have this in your heart within you,

0:23:00.120,0:23:08.060
it opens the door to whatever you are facing, to whatever situation you are in.

0:23:08.060,0:23:14.180
Are you facing sickness, disease, whatever - it opens the door.

0:23:14.180,0:23:20.360
You don't need enemy to attack you; you have attacked yourself.

0:23:20.360,0:23:27.460
You know what it means when Jesus says, "Forgive them as you forgive those who trespassed against you".

0:23:27.460,0:23:38.440
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves, heals and delivers.

0:23:38.440,0:23:40.760
Please, with pure heart!

0:23:40.760,0:23:43.960
This is why we gave you faith bracelets.

0:23:43.960,0:23:48.360
We have prayed over this; we put it on our altar before giving it to you

0:23:48.360,0:23:52.240
- just to take you from kindergarten, baby.

0:23:52.240,0:23:57.740
Things of the Spirit, you have to start from the foundation.

0:23:57.740,0:24:09.420
You start it on the outside, to remind you on the outside that you need to reset your belief.

0:24:09.420,0:24:18.880
Each time you sit down watching football on the television or whatever, it would be in your hand.

0:24:18.880,0:24:23.620
"Take more of me and give me more of You."

0:24:23.620,0:24:29.020
You would not know when you voice out, "Jesus!", instead of "Hey!"

0:24:29.020,0:24:34.460
Because "Hey!" is much of your language.

0:24:34.460,0:24:42.240
So you have to be pregnant of Jesus to shout "Jesus!"

0:24:42.240,0:24:50.720
We manifest what we possess.

0:24:50.720,0:24:56.220
Sometimes in the dream, when your wife, husband or children sleep,

0:24:56.220,0:25:00.520
side-by-side with you, in the night she would say, "My honey!"

0:25:00.520,0:25:02.660
- "What happened?"
- "It was a nightmare."

0:25:02.660,0:25:13.680
Because she is manifesting what she possesses; she possesses honey.

0:25:13.680,0:25:18.460
Even inside the vehicle when the vehicle is about to have an accident,

0:25:18.460,0:25:23.780
you say, "Hey!" - she/he is manifesting what she/he possesses.

0:25:23.780,0:25:36.060
You have to possess Jesus to manifest Jesus.

0:25:36.060,0:25:36.940
That is all.

0:25:36.940,0:25:38.740
This will help you:

0:25:38.740,0:25:43.700
"In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus..." - on the outside.

0:25:43.700,0:25:49.520
You need something to help you on the outside.

0:25:49.520,0:25:54.040
When you are alone, when you are about to sleep, you lie on the bed,

0:25:54.040,0:25:56.140
that is the last thing you would do before you sleep.

0:25:56.140,0:26:00.820
Just lie on the bed - "Jesus Christ, take more of me and give me more of You."

0:26:00.820,0:26:06.640
To flush out all this... - that is it.

0:26:06.640,0:26:09.160
You need that.

0:26:09.160,0:26:11.400
Let's pray for our nation.

0:26:11.400,0:26:19.460
Whatever you have with you as a contact, contact point.

0:26:19.460,0:26:25.180
Bless our nation, Lord.
Redeem our nation, Lord.

0:26:25.180,0:26:33.060
God's intervention!

0:26:33.060,0:26:34.740
I can't hear you.

0:26:34.740,0:26:36.740
[Amen!]

0:26:36.740,0:26:40.020
Yes, God's intervention.

0:26:40.020,0:26:46.040
It's like every nation, every country today is facing challenges.

0:26:46.040,0:27:00.800
On the last day
Only true believers shall be raptured

0:27:00.800,0:27:02.100
I can't hear you.

0:27:02.100,0:27:24.940
On the last day
Only true believers shall be raptured

0:27:24.940,0:27:38.840
God's intervention!

0:27:38.840,0:27:48.220
Open your lips and begin to rebuke challenges, corruption, misjudge, misrule.

0:27:48.220,0:27:52.480
Right now, open your lips and pray.

0:27:52.480,0:27:58.300
Misjudge, misrule, killing, stealing, destruction.

0:28:05.640,0:28:08.500
God's intervention!

0:28:08.500,0:28:12.780
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:28:12.780,0:28:24.400
Right now, pray for your leaders; ask God to redeem your leaders and put them on track.

0:28:24.400,0:28:30.280
Strengthen them with wisdom and understanding;

0:28:30.280,0:28:35.740
cover them with the blood of Jesus.

0:28:44.300,0:28:49.100
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:28:49.100,0:28:50.660
I can't hear you.

0:28:50.660,0:28:51.660
[Amen!]

0:28:51.660,0:28:53.000
I can't hear you.

0:28:53.000,0:28:54.040
[Amen!]

0:28:54.040,0:28:55.360
I can't hear you.

0:28:55.360,0:28:56.180
[Amen!]

0:28:56.180,0:28:57.400
I can't hear you.

0:28:57.400,0:28:58.320
[Amen!]

0:28:58.320,0:28:59.860
I can't hear you.

0:28:59.860,0:29:01.440
[Amen!]

0:29:01.440,0:29:04.600
Prayer For The Nations
With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:29:04.600,0:29:08.420
Listen once again: God has spoken.

0:29:08.420,0:29:10.420
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:29:10.420,0:29:14.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:14.820,0:29:18.720
Hallelujah!

0:29:18.720,0:29:25.860
The issue about your heart is a fundamental issue.

0:29:25.860,0:29:35.200
You have received all the deliverance here today, all the blessing here today,

0:29:35.200,0:29:39.880
breakthrough without a pure heart.

0:29:39.880,0:29:42.300
You will lose them.

0:29:42.300,0:29:47.100
It is a pure heart that maintains the blessing of God.

0:29:47.100,0:29:54.280
It is a pure heart that maintains God's blessing.

0:29:54.280,0:29:57.040
Maintenance is very important.

0:29:57.040,0:30:04.740
I know you have been delivered but don't forget your heart.

0:30:04.740,0:30:19.580
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves, man knows that Jesus heals,

0:30:19.580,0:30:22.540
man knows that Jesus blesses.

0:30:22.540,0:30:30.320
There is no way you can maintain God's blessing without a pure heart.

0:30:30.320,0:30:32.840
So, we have to be serious.

0:30:32.840,0:30:37.700
Heart - the hearts I'm seeing are full of unforgiveness,

0:30:37.700,0:30:40.020
bitterness, envy, jealousy.

0:30:40.020,0:30:45.980
How can I continue to tell you this and yet, the hurt is still there.

0:30:45.980,0:30:51.420
Envy, jealousy, bitterness, hatred, unforgiving spirit.

0:30:51.420,0:30:58.560
A lot of people I'm seeing among the crowd, sitting down

0:30:58.560,0:31:01.920
still have that unforgiving spirit.

0:31:01.920,0:31:08.340
That shows that what is not permanent is not of God.

0:31:08.340,0:31:11.760
What is not done well is not done at all.

0:31:11.760,0:31:16.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:16.620,0:31:23.900
So in this case, will you be ready when the Lord comes?

0:31:23.900,0:31:28.480
It could be tomorrow when you are not even here; you are home.

0:31:28.480,0:31:32.400
Will the Lord meet you?

0:31:32.400,0:31:36.340
Now, I'm leaving you in faith; will I meet you tomorrow in faith?

0:31:36.340,0:31:39.480
With unforgiving spirit?

0:31:39.480,0:31:47.100
I'm leaving you now in faith; will I meet you next Sunday with unforgiving spirit?

0:31:47.100,0:31:49.100
It is not possible.

0:31:49.100,0:31:55.320
I'm leaving you now in faith, will I meet you next Sunday with bitterness in your heart?

0:31:55.320,0:31:57.240
It is not possible.

0:31:57.240,0:31:59.240
So it is a waste.

0:31:59.240,0:32:01.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:01.520,0:32:13.160
Forget about miracle, deliverance - we are talking of soul.

0:32:13.160,0:32:18.040
You keep talking of your knowledge of the Scripture.

0:32:18.040,0:32:24.960
I know you have the knowledge but on the history, theory, about the Word of God.

0:32:24.960,0:32:29.680
That cannot save you alone.

0:32:29.680,0:32:35.480
On the history, theories, the Word of God - that cannot save you.

0:32:35.480,0:32:40.160
You can read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, quoting from verses to verses.

0:32:40.160,0:32:47.660
But yet, on the last day, you are in hell - hell fire.

0:32:47.660,0:32:54.020
We are doing this, having the history and theory about the Word of God

0:32:54.020,0:32:58.180
for the purpose of preaching and teaching.

0:32:58.180,0:33:01.020
To preach it - "Jesus is Lord!"

0:33:01.020,0:33:05.120
And teach it as a lecturer or whatever we call it.

0:33:05.120,0:33:12.460
This is the reason why we just have the history and theory of it.

0:33:12.460,0:33:21.380
We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.

0:33:21.380,0:33:22.260
Tell your neighbour.

0:33:22.260,0:33:30.560
We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.

0:33:30.560,0:33:31.760
That's all.

0:33:31.760,0:33:34.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:34.920,0:33:40.060
Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.

0:33:40.060,0:33:41.360
You say, "What is my calling?"

0:33:41.360,0:33:46.200
Somebody says, "T.B. Joshua, what is my calling as a Christian?"

0:33:46.200,0:33:49.920
You ask me about your callling; what about your spiritual gift?

0:33:49.920,0:34:02.800
Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.

0:34:02.800,0:34:07.860
Your calling - you say, "What is my calling?"

0:34:07.860,0:34:10.200
"You are talking of your spiritual gift."

0:34:10.200,0:34:11.500
"What is my spiritual gift?"

0:34:11.500,0:34:13.500
"You are talking of your calling."

0:34:13.500,0:34:17.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:17.220,0:34:21.780
So the whole thing is mixed up.

0:34:21.780,0:34:24.540
So, please, I want to leave you. Thank you very much.
