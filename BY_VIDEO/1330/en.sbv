0:00:00.000,0:00:00.500
Thank you, good morning!

0:00:03.490,0:00:05.400
You may be seated, thank you!

0:00:06.640,0:00:08.640
Hallelujah!

0:00:09.460,0:00:11.460
Glory be to God.

0:00:13.299,0:00:18.749
I'm here to give you just a short word of exhortation.

0:00:20.350,0:00:23.699
You know God is working out the answer.

0:00:26.109,0:00:33.689
You remember the message given to you concerning reporting which is very important and I know

0:00:35.950,0:00:38.279
you are doing what the word says.

0:00:39.280,0:00:45.989
It's an issue that will really help you in your domestic affairs, your company and everywhere

0:00:45.989,0:00:48.959
You find yourself.  The Bible says salvation is

0:00:50.320,0:00:52.649
of confession and believing

0:00:53.590,0:00:55.590
so you must know that

0:00:55.750,0:00:59.489
reporting should be an expression of believing.

0:01:01.180,0:01:03.180
Reporting should be what?

0:01:03.430,0:01:05.849
Should be an expression of believing.

0:01:06.970,0:01:11.729
Wherever you find yourself as a Christian, you are to report what you see.

0:01:14.500,0:01:19.229
As a Christian wherever you find yourself, you are to what?

0:01:20.290,0:01:22.830
You are to report what you what?

0:01:23.890,0:01:26.009
What you see and what you what?

0:01:28.150,0:01:32.129
Because when you report what you see and what you hear, it settles issues,

0:01:33.729,0:01:35.729
It answers questions,

0:01:37.659,0:01:39.719
It Clarifies doubts, and

0:01:41.200,0:01:43.200
provides a way forward.

0:01:45.369,0:01:47.369
Work alone

0:01:48.220,0:01:51.839
cannot help any establishment grow.

0:01:52.899,0:01:54.700
Every establishment

0:01:54.700,0:01:56.729
expects two things from you;

0:01:58.180,0:02:02.099
working and reporting

0:02:04.830,0:02:08.779
Today you are here in the church; you are to report whatever you see that is wrong among the workers and the members.

0:02:17.820,0:02:19.820
Don't just leave. If you say to someone at home 'no, no look at the way the woman behaved'.

0:02:19.820,0:02:21.820
You know when we were in the church, the woman was disturbing'.

0:02:26.940,0:02:31.520
Discussing this at home is a sin. You have to report it in church; you have to write it down

0:02:32.340,0:02:37.610
and give it to the  OSHA to kindly submit it to the church authority.

0:02:38.400,0:02:40.400
You have to be vigilant. Be vigilant about what is going on around you.

0:02:41.640,0:02:43.760
Note the woman or man who is moving from one

0:02:45.000,0:02:51.589
group to another,  moving around and talking.

0:02:51.590,0:02:53.590
Note the way he passes a note around the church!

0:02:53.790,0:02:55.770
You have to report all these behaviors

0:03:02.010,0:03:05.629
Hallelujah, that is very important.

0:03:06.989,0:03:11.959
Reporting should be an expression of believing.

0:03:16.680,0:03:18.680
You are to report unruly behaviors,

0:03:19.680,0:03:23.630
the visions you have about your establishments, dreams,

0:03:28.140,0:03:30.230
many dreams and visions you often have.

0:03:31.560,0:03:33.560
God will show you.

0:03:34.110,0:03:36.110
You can send a letter or a mail.

0:03:37.050,0:03:42.200
You can even  travel from your country to another country just to report that vision you have because you are a believer.

0:03:46.350,0:03:48.350
Hallelujah!

0:03:48.600,0:03:50.600
I'm thanking you for your prayers because God has spoken regardless of our situations.

0:03:59.720,0:04:02.679
Hallelujah! so rise up for a prayer

0:04:07.880,0:04:13.359
If you honestly examine your heart in the light of God's word,

0:04:16.160,0:04:18.160
you will discover that there is a spirit of unforgiveness,

0:04:18.160,0:04:20.160
a spirit of anger, a spirit of bitterness, a spirit of jealousy, and a spirit of envy.

0:04:38.389,0:04:40.389
And such spirits, break our communion  and relationship with God.

0:04:46.850,0:04:50.049
They open the door to whatever Situation you are in now.

0:04:53.960,0:04:58.930
You say 'I have sickness'. What is the root  of the sickness? -Unforgiveness.

0:05:01.100,0:05:03.579
You say 'I have Hardship'. What is the root of your hardship? -

0:05:04.370,0:05:09.010
Envy, jealousy and anger. Those are the root causes.

0:05:09.860,0:05:11.860
The routes to get to you are;

0:05:16.880,0:05:18.880
Nightmare, barrenness, anger, jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness-these are the routes.

0:05:23.150,0:05:30.459
Righteousness is the route to blessing and healing if you are honest to yourself and examine yourself in the light of God's Word.

0:05:35.120,0:05:38.340
Think about it. You will see many people you refused to forgive because of this or that,  or because they cheated you ...

0:05:43.880,0:05:47.800
You will see  people you have put in the prison yard and you are still working freely

0:05:48.410,0:05:50.180
everywhere.

0:05:50.180,0:05:53.769
You will see people that are in bondage just because of you.

0:05:55.460,0:05:57.460
Are you talking of divorce?

0:05:57.680,0:06:02.530
You have divorced many men and women and you said over your dead body will they see their children.

0:06:03.380,0:06:08.770
What is your problem?

0:06:09.470,0:06:15.369
Why will the man or woman not see their children? You people are already divorced

0:06:18.530,0:06:21.309
And you call God's name. For what?

0:06:26.300,0:06:29.919
You people are already divorced and you are still trying to keep the children away from your spouse.

0:06:39.860,0:06:43.900
Father forgives both the  accused and the accuser,

0:06:49.790,0:06:52.150
forgives both the person who is wrong and the person who is right.

0:06:54.350,0:06:59.980
You say ‘this is witchcraft on you, they attack you’.  who attack you?

0:07:00.680,0:07:03.070
It because you are caring unforgiving spirit;

0:07:04.280,0:07:09.790
Envy, jealousy.... and you say you are attacked. No one has attacked you.Once you have these spirits,

0:07:09.790,0:07:10.400
you have attacked yourself.

0:07:10.400,0:07:12.400
Are you there?

0:07:13.400,0:07:20.379
Listen to me again; they open the door to whatever

0:07:21.800,0:07:23.800
challenges you

0:07:25.130,0:07:27.730
are in. Are you sick, facing hardship

0:07:29.780,0:07:31.869
poverty,

0:07:33.170,0:07:35.830
loneliness, rejection? whatever you are facing,

0:07:37.190,0:07:39.190
the roots of those things are;

0:07:39.530,0:07:40.820
unforgiveness

0:07:40.820,0:07:42.410
envy

0:07:42.410,0:07:43.670
jealousy

0:07:43.670,0:07:50.650
bitterness. These are the roots. You don't need the enemy to attack you once you   have attacked yourself

0:07:52.460,0:07:56.949
Once your relationship with God breaks, what else again? you are accessible to Satan.

0:07:58.190,0:08:03.910
It is easy now for  Satan to finally break the communion and  your relationship with God.

0:08:04.340,0:08:08.319
Once your relationship with God breaks, you are on your own.

0:08:09.650,0:08:16.569
Unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, bitterness, strife, hatred, just name it

0:08:19.710,0:08:21.710
open the door to whatever you are in

0:08:28.470,0:08:35.150
When you leave here now, it is not too late. From your heart you can say ‘what this man said, I am ready for it’.

0:08:35.700,0:08:40.460
Once you say you are ready. Are you in concord with your heart that the job is done?

0:08:41.969,0:08:48.319
When you leave here, you can continue to reconcile either with text messages, phone calls, whatever way you can.

0:08:49.260,0:08:51.260
Just try to settle yourself.

0:08:52.680,0:08:54.979
I release you from the pain of the past.

0:08:56.220,0:08:58.580
I release you from the pain of the past.

0:08:59.460,0:09:01.819
I release you from that unforgiving spirit.

0:09:03.150,0:09:08.959
That bitterness, envy, and jealousy. Be releasing in the name of Jesus!

0:09:12.750,0:09:19.820
You know, you can be released, you know that, you know that, be released in the name of Jesus!

0:09:22.680,0:09:24.680
Be release in the name of Jesus!

0:09:26.910,0:09:29.689
Such spirits break

0:09:32.340,0:09:34.340
The communion, and

0:09:35.460,0:09:38.929
relationship with God. Once broken, you’re on your own.

0:09:38.929,0:09:40.929
You're on your own.

0:09:43.530,0:09:48.499
And once you are on you're on your own,

0:09:49.170,0:09:51.170
here come poverty,

0:09:51.660,0:09:57.499
affliction, hardship, rejection,

0:09:58.350,0:10:00.350
and nightmare.

0:10:02.100,0:10:08.900
With pure heart man knows that Jesus saves.

0:10:11.730,0:10:19.070
With a pure heart man knows that Jesus Saves, heals, blesses and delivers.

0:10:19.800,0:10:21.800
With a Pure heart!

0:10:26.540,0:10:27.812
You keep saying

0:10:27.812,0:10:30.610
'I am healed, I am delivered”  but

0:10:31.190,0:10:33.820
you are about to lose the healing, deliverance,

0:10:34.339,0:10:37.119
with that unforgiving spirit, bitterness,

0:10:38.240,0:10:40.240
envy and jealousy in your heart.

0:10:54.260,0:10:56.260
You can receive deliverance but because of unforgiving spirit, you will lose it.

0:10:57.620,0:11:00.940
With that unforgiving spirit, envy, and jealousy in your heart, healing and deliverance cannot be permanent.

0:11:02.750,0:11:04.750
That cannot be permanent.

0:11:04.940,0:11:11.169
This is why our life is epileptic. it goes up and down.

0:11:12.589,0:11:14.589
Up and down!

0:11:14.839,0:11:20.648
And you keep asking yourself why your deliverance and healing are not permanent

0:11:21.040,0:11:24.849
It can be forever. You are here forever. You are blessed forever.

0:11:25.640,0:11:31.149
It is a past victory but because of unforgiving spirit, envy,

0:11:31.910,0:11:35.800
hatred and  bitterness in you,  that cannot be permanent.

0:11:40.100,0:11:45.850
As you're standing,  begin to examine yourself. Ask yourself;

0:11:45.850,0:11:47.060
What is wrong? what is wrong ?what is wrong with me? what is the Next step now?

0:11:47.060,0:11:49.869
It's better not to receive than to receive and lose it.

0:11:52.670,0:11:54.670
Ask yourself; What is wrong with me?

0:11:59.300,0:12:01.450
Why is my life not constant?

0:12:03.950,0:12:05.950
I'm happy and blessed now and another time, I am not

0:12:09.470,0:12:12.459
Why?

0:12:13.700,0:12:15.789
Jesus is the same yesterday, today and for  forever

0:12:16.520,0:12:23.259
His blessings are the same yesterday, today. and  forever. His healing is the same yesterday,  today, and  forever. Why all these?

0:12:24.140,0:12:26.120
Why?

0:12:26.120,0:12:28.120
Why?

0:12:28.520,0:12:30.520
How can you labor,

0:12:31.070,0:12:34.659
Sweat, and  suddenly you are back to square one again.

0:12:40.930,0:12:43.139
You are here today because you

0:12:44.680,0:12:50.639
See the strength of God from strength to strength. That is why you are here.

0:12:52.060,0:12:55.829
Irrespective of tribulation, persecution, and hatred-

0:12:57.130,0:13:00.089
Strength to strength. That is why you are here

0:13:02.050,0:13:04.050
Irrespective of name-calling-

0:13:05.440,0:13:07.440
Strength to strength

0:13:08.529,0:13:10.529
That is why you are here.

0:13:12.190,0:13:15.690
When you expect something to spoil and it's not spoiled, you join them.

0:13:16.660,0:13:21.089
When you expect something to destroy and it refuses to destroy, you join them.

0:13:21.910,0:13:25.889
When you expect something to disappear  and it refuses to disappear, you join them.

0:13:25.889,0:13:27.889
That is why you are here today.

0:13:28.750,0:13:31.500
Honestly examine your hearts

0:13:34.329,0:13:40.769
Christianity lies in the heart. Tell your neighbor; Christianity lies in the heart.

0:13:43.060,0:13:45.959
Your appearance is a camouflage.

0:13:46.750,0:13:51.659
Your makeup, your hair, your beauty, your handsomeness are camouflage.

0:13:53.560,0:13:56.219
The real man is  your heart.

0:13:58.060,0:14:01.859
This is why the Bible says faith is of man's heart.

0:14:04.240,0:14:08.310
The one that worship God is your heart not  your body.

0:14:13.750,0:14:15.579
Listen again!

0:14:15.579,0:14:21.869
Honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word without prejudice.

0:14:24.220,0:14:26.220
Honestly examine your heart and

0:14:27.010,0:14:32.249
you will find out that your heart is full of unforgiving spirit,

0:14:33.940,0:14:37.979
bitterness, envy and jealousy.

0:14:41.880,0:14:49.009
Forgive us as we do what?  Is that not the promise?

0:14:49.009,0:14:51.009
Forgive us as we for give those who what?

0:14:51.009,0:14:53.009
Why unforgiving spirit, bitterness, envy, hatred, and jealousy?

0:14:53.009,0:14:55.009
You are what God  says you are. Why comparing yourself to others?

0:14:56.069,0:14:58.069
Why measuring yourself to others? Why?

0:14:58.069,0:15:00.069
You say 'I am too fat, I need to be slim. Look at that one, he is very slim.

0:15:25.829,0:15:27.829
When you see a beautiful car in the car park, you say ‘I must get mine”

0:16:13.589,0:16:19.279
You do anything to get yours

0:16:19.279,0:16:20.670
Honestly examine your heart in the light of God’s word ; you will see that your heart is holding grudges, envy and jealousy.

0:16:20.670,0:16:21.170
Father, release your children in the name of Jesus!  Every unclean spirit in your career.

0:16:21.170,0:16:22.670
Father, release your children in the name of Jesus!  Every unclean spirit in your life.

0:16:22.670,0:16:23.310
Every unclean spirit –leave my people in the name of Jesus!

0:16:23.310,0:16:25.310
God has spoken, rejoice!

0:16:25.310,0:16:27.310
Rejoice!

0:16:30.630,0:16:37.339
I cover you with the blood of Jesus!
I seal you with the blood of Jesus!

0:16:37.339,0:16:39.339
Be covered with the blood of Jesus!
Begin a new life, a new beginning.

0:16:40.970,0:16:42.970
A new beginning!, A new beginning!  A new beginning!

0:16:43.110,0:16:50.089
A new beginning is a new life, a new direction and a new way.

0:16:51.600,0:16:53.689
A new beginning! A new beginning!  A new beginning!

0:16:54.990,0:17:01.549
A new beginning! A new beginning!  A new beginning!  In the name of Jesus!

0:17:09.659,0:17:15.499
Four days ago, someone asked me a question;

0:17:17.130,0:17:21.919
Sir, am I the real person God wants me to be?

0:17:23.189,0:17:26.329
I said “What do you mean by that?”

0:17:27.839,0:17:29.490
He said because he does not know how to go forward again.

0:17:29.490,0:17:32.299
He said he is a Christian.

0:17:33.510,0:17:38.209
I said ‘so you are a Christian then you are saying this? This is blasphemy.

0:17:42.809,0:17:44.809
This is blasphemy.

0:17:48.720,0:17:51.980
If you want to be the person God

0:17:53.580,0:17:55.580
Wants you to be,

0:17:57.150,0:18:03.109
If you want to know your destiny,

0:18:04.770,0:18:06.770
then you need to know God better.

0:18:09.240,0:18:11.240
Get to know God better.

0:18:12.299,0:18:15.499
The way you know God now is by senses,

0:18:17.940,0:18:19.940
By your eyes,

0:18:20.610,0:18:22.610
Yes, this is true.

0:18:22.740,0:18:25.819
This is true. This is this. This is that.

0:18:25.820,0:18:30.980
You know God by what you see,  hear and touch.

0:18:38.549,0:18:41.689
He asked me what I meant by knowing God better.

0:18:47.070,0:18:51.860
I told him; "you know God by your senses and if you think you know God beyond your senses,

0:18:52.930,0:18:55.839
I'm here now. What are you looking at?

0:18:56.960,0:19:01.719
He said  'I see your body, hands, nose,...' and I said 'No, no, no, no,

0:19:03.620,0:19:05.620
Our appearance is a camouflage.

0:19:13.280,0:19:17.560
To know the person God wants you to be,

0:19:19.670,0:19:25.479
to know your destiny,  you need to know God better. Tell your neighbor!

0:19:29.360,0:19:31.360
I can't hear you.

0:19:33.830,0:19:38.469
You know God no doubt, but you need to know God better. You say, you know God,

0:19:38.470,0:19:45.550
you know God, but just by senses, what you see, what you hear and touch.

0:19:49.790,0:19:52.839
You cannot see beyond that.

0:19:53.690,0:20:00.489
Beyond this carrot, and TB Joshua you cannot see.  All you see is the appearance.

0:20:01.010,0:20:03.010
You need to know God better

0:20:03.410,0:20:06.969
by discovering your spiritual gifts.

0:20:10.640,0:20:13.719
By discovering your spiritual gifts.

0:20:16.160,0:20:20.440
Because the Bible says no one can say 'Jesus is lord,' except by the help of the Holy spirit.

0:20:21.560,0:20:28.179
And God is spirit so you have to warship him in spirit and in truth.

0:20:28.460,0:20:30.460
How can you worship God without the Holy Spirit,

0:20:30.560,0:20:32.560
without the Spirit of God?

0:20:32.840,0:20:36.160
How can you know your destiny without the Spirit of God?

0:20:37.190,0:20:39.190
No, one can say 'Jesus is Lord,'

0:20:39.500,0:20:43.570
except by the help of the Holy Spirit. Without your spiritual gift, you are zero.

0:20:46.130,0:20:52.989
Without your spiritually gift, you continue to warship God by senses; what you see, hear and feel.

0:21:02.760,0:21:04.760
You cannot become God’s person on the history and theory about the word of God.

0:21:15.300,0:21:16.660
Tell your neighbor!

0:21:16.660,0:21:17.300
You cannot become God’s person on the history and theory about the word of God.

0:21:17.300,0:21:19.300
This is what makes you a child of God, a born again; History and theory about the word of God.

0:21:31.530,0:21:33.530
No, you cannot become God’s person on the history and theory about the word of God alone

0:21:33.530,0:21:35.530
The history and theory about the word of God are valuable but cannot work without the Holy Spirit

0:22:13.410,0:22:13.910
I command healing on you in the name of Jesus!

0:22:13.910,0:22:14.410
I command healing on you in the name of Jesus!

0:22:14.410,0:22:14.910
I command healing on you in the name of Jesus!

0:22:14.910,0:22:15.410
I command healing on you in the name of Jesus!

0:22:16.680,0:22:18.680
God has spoken! In the name of Jesus!

0:22:19.350,0:22:21.350
I can't hear you.

0:22:21.480,0:22:25.969
I can sense God's healing touching you.

0:22:28.500,0:22:31.000
I can sense God's deliverance touching you. In Jesus' name!

0:22:36.420,0:22:43.940
Hear this, God has spoken! Rejoice!

0:22:48.510,0:22:50.510
Don't forget the message for you.

0:22:51.810,0:22:53.810
The spirit of unforgiveness,

0:22:55.470,0:22:57.470
anger, and bitterness

0:22:58.410,0:22:59.700
break

0:22:59.700,0:23:03.530
the communion and  relationship with God and

0:23:04.230,0:23:08.030
Once that relationship is broken. What else again? You are your own.

0:23:09.720,0:23:13.490
Those spirit; malice,  bitterness,

0:23:15.010,0:23:17.309
Jealousy, hatred and unforgiveness.

0:23:18.370,0:23:22.829
If you have them in you, They open the door

0:23:23.710,0:23:25.179
to whatever

0:23:25.179,0:23:26.710
You are facing

0:23:26.710,0:23:32.069
and  whatever situation you are in. Be it sicknesses, diseases, or whatever.

0:23:32.860,0:23:34.860
They Open the door.

0:23:35.409,0:23:38.759
You don't need the enemy to attack you. You attack yourself with these spirits.

0:23:41.380,0:23:45.089
You know what it means when Jesus says "forgive them as we forgive those who..." what?

0:23:48.730,0:23:50.730
With a pure heart,

0:23:51.850,0:23:59.250
man knows that Jesus heals, saves and delivers.

0:23:59.830,0:24:01.830
Please with pure heart!

0:24:01.990,0:24:03.990
This is why we give you bracelets

0:24:05.200,0:24:11.819
We have prayed over them, put them in the altar before giving you just  to help you start growing like a

0:24:12.100,0:24:13.510
baby

0:24:13.510,0:24:18.150
Things of the Spirit, you have to start from the foundation

0:24:18.549,0:24:24.869
So you need to start it on the outside to reset your belief.

0:24:25.600,0:24:29.219
To reset your belief, to reset your believe!

0:24:30.669,0:24:38.038
Each time you sit down watching football on the television or whatever, It should be in your hand.

0:24:38.039,0:24:43.259
You should be saying 'Take more of me and give me more of you'.

0:24:44.049,0:24:47.459
you will not know when you shout out 'Jesus' instead of

0:24:48.190,0:24:50.190
'Hey'

0:24:50.200,0:24:52.919
Because 'hey' is more of your language.

0:24:55.630,0:25:01.199
So you have to be pregnant of Jesus to shout 'Jesus.'

0:25:03.549,0:25:05.819
We manifest what we possess.

0:25:07.270,0:25:09.270
We manifest what?

0:25:09.970,0:25:14.760
You manifest what you possess. Sometimes in the dream you see when

0:25:15.100,0:25:18.809
Your child, wife or husband sleeps side by side with you and suddenly he/she shouts; Honey, Honey!

0:25:20.289,0:25:27.749
And when you ask what happen, he or she says "it is a nightmare" because she is manifesting what she possesses.

0:25:28.420,0:25:30.420
She possesses 'Honey'

0:25:34.930,0:25:39.209
Even inside a vehicle when the vehicle is about to have an accident, you shout 'Hey'

0:25:41.440,0:25:46.859
You manifest what you possess.

0:25:48.310,0:25:50.310
So you have to possess who?

0:25:50.500,0:25:52.500
To manifest?  Speak to me! Speak to me!

0:25:53.470,0:25:56.520
possess who?  To manifest?

0:25:58.060,0:26:02.429
Meditating will help you; In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus .....

0:26:03.100,0:26:08.370
Even on the outside, you need something to help you too.

0:26:10.660,0:26:15.209
Meditate when you are alone and when you are about to sleep.  It  should be the last thing on your mind before falling asleep.

0:26:15.250,0:26:20.400
Just lie on the bed and continue saying "Jesus take more of me and give me more of you".

0:26:22.090,0:26:24.090
To flush out all the bad spirits in you.

0:26:27.820,0:26:29.820
You need that.

0:26:30.430,0:26:32.430
Let's pray for our nation.

0:26:32.890,0:26:36.780
Raise whatever you have with you as a contact point

0:26:40.840,0:26:41.340
Bless our nation, Lord.                        Redeem our nation, Lord.

0:26:41.340,0:26:41.840
God's intervention!

0:26:41.840,0:26:42.340
God's intervention!

0:26:42.340,0:26:42.840
God's intervention!

0:26:42.840,0:26:44.340
I can't hear you.

0:26:58.150,0:27:06.089
Yes, God's intervention! it's like every nation every country today faces challenges

0:27:20.020,0:27:22.900
I can't hear you

0:27:46.280,0:27:50.829
God's intervention !

0:27:53.390,0:27:55.390
God's intervention !

0:27:55.390,0:27:58.809
God's intervention !

0:28:00.290,0:28:03.459
Open your lips and begin to rebuke challenges,

0:28:04.580,0:28:06.050
corruption,

0:28:06.050,0:28:07.640
misjudge,

0:28:07.640,0:28:11.319
misrule, right now open your Lips and pray.

0:28:13.730,0:28:15.730
Misjudge, misrule,

0:28:17.600,0:28:19.600
Killing,  stilling and destruction.

0:28:23.780,0:28:26.170
God's intervention,

0:28:28.309,0:28:32.529
in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:28:34.070,0:28:37.900
Right now,  pray for your leaders. Ask God to redeem your leaders and

0:28:41.750,0:28:43.750
Put them on track,

0:28:46.040,0:28:49.359
Strengthen them with wisdom and understanding,

0:28:51.620,0:28:54.069
Cover them with the blood of Jesus.

0:29:05.420,0:29:12.249
In Jesus Christ name, we pray! I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

0:29:15.170,0:29:20.779
I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

0:29:26.010,0:29:31.159
Listen once again, God has spoken. You may be seated. Thank you

0:29:36.540,0:29:41.779
Hallelujah! hallelujah! Issue about your heart

0:29:44.400,0:29:46.459
Is a fundamental issue.

0:29:47.040,0:29:52.279
You have received all the deliverance and blessings here today.

0:29:52.830,0:29:57.350
All the deliverance,blessing and break through,

0:29:58.410,0:30:00.410
without a pure heart,

0:30:01.080,0:30:03.080
You will  lose them

0:30:03.390,0:30:06.979
It is a pure heart that maintains the blessing of God.

0:30:08.220,0:30:12.140
It is a pure heart that maintains God's blessing.

0:30:15.540,0:30:22.370
So maintenance is very important. I know you have been delivered, but don't forget your heart.

0:30:25.950,0:30:32.419
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus

0:30:35.580,0:30:37.560
Saves, heals and blesses

0:30:40.920,0:30:47.029
There's no way you can maintain God's blessings

0:30:48.510,0:30:50.510
without a pure heart.

0:30:51.480,0:30:57.890
So we have to be serious. The hearts I'm seeing  are full of unforgiveness,

0:30:59.280,0:31:05.780
bitterness, envy, jealousy. I cannot continue preaching to you and yet you hearts are still full of those bad spirits;

0:31:07.050,0:31:12.050
jealousy, bitterness; hatred and unforgiving spirit.

0:31:12.630,0:31:16.099
I am still seeing lot of people seating here with unclean heart.

0:31:17.070,0:31:24.529
Yeah, many are seated down here. So this shows that

0:31:26.160,0:31:31.670
what is not permanent, is not of God, what isn't done well, isn't done at all.

0:31:37.799,0:31:39.799
So in this case,

0:31:40.920,0:31:42.660
Will you be ready

0:31:42.660,0:31:44.660
when the lord comes?

0:31:44.940,0:31:48.530
It could be  tomorrow or when you are home.

0:31:49.380,0:31:51.530
Will the lord meet you?

0:31:53.580,0:31:59.000
Now I'm leaving you in faith, will I meet you tomorrow in faith or with unforgiving spirit?

0:32:00.630,0:32:04.189
I'm leaving you now in faith, will I meet you next Sunday with unforgiving spirit?

0:32:06.929,0:32:09.499
It's not possible

0:32:10.169,0:32:13.669
I'm leaving you now in faith, will I meet you next Sunday with bitterness in your heart?

0:32:14.700,0:32:19.640
It's not possible

0:32:22.740,0:32:27.109
Forget about miracle, deliverance, We are talking about your soul.

0:32:35.460,0:32:38.900
You talk about your knowledge in the scripture.

0:32:38.900,0:32:44.599
I know you have the knowledge, but only the history and the theory of the word of God

0:32:45.150,0:32:47.869
cannot save you .

0:32:50.700,0:32:54.290
Only the history and the theory of the word of God cannot save you .

0:32:54.870,0:32:58.790
You can preach the Bible from Genesis to Revelation,

0:32:59.250,0:33:04.520
quoting from verses to verses and yet on the last day, you still go to hell  fire.

0:33:08.910,0:33:14.629
We are using the history and the theory of the word of God for the purpose of preaching and teaching.

0:33:24.570,0:33:30.950
This is the reason why we have the history and the theory of the word of God.

0:33:33.809,0:33:40.879
We are only made spiritual by living in the word and by the word living in us. That's all!

0:33:42.690,0:33:45.260
Tell your neighbor;

0:33:46.990,0:33:52.380
We are only made spiritual by living in the word and by the word living in us.

0:33:56.200,0:34:00.029
Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.

0:34:01.299,0:34:03.389
You talk about your calling. What about your spiritual gift?

0:34:11.169,0:34:14.638
Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.

0:34:26.379,0:34:34.019
When you talk about your calling, you are also talking about your spiritual gift and vice versa

0:34:34.019,0:34:34.519
So the whole thing is mixed up.

0:34:34.519,0:34:36.019
I want to leave you, thank you very much!
