0:00:00.000,0:00:03.580
As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua descended from the altar

0:00:03.580,0:00:09.420
to minister prayer to the congregation, the fire of the Holy Spirit erupted on the scene.

0:00:09.420,0:00:14.860
There was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run from  the light of God which searched out

0:00:14.860,0:00:21.640
every shade of darkness and affliction, dispelling them with just a touch from God's anointed servant.

0:00:21.640,0:00:25.860
Arrested by the power of God, the evil spirits confess their wicked deeds

0:00:25.860,0:00:29.960
before being cast out of people's lives across the arena of liberty.

0:00:29.960,0:00:33.960
As the ministration continued, this crippled man began to cry out.

0:00:33.960,0:00:38.440
Please, Man of God, help me. I can't walk; I am having difficulty in walking.

0:00:38.440,0:00:42.840
I use a walking aid to walk.

0:00:42.840,0:00:45.420
Please, Man of God, help me - I'm booked for two more surgeries.

0:00:45.420,0:00:53.040
I had surgery on my back and I am booked for two more on my cervical and thoracic.

0:00:53.040,0:00:56.840
And from my waist downwards is dead. I don't have any feelings at all.

0:00:56.840,0:01:03.800
I am wearing a knee brace to help me to walk and a lumbar corset to help me sit up straight.

0:01:03.800,0:01:05.060
Man of God, help me.

0:01:05.060,0:01:08.260
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
Prayer and Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:01:08.260,0:01:10.500
Man of God, please help me.

0:01:10.500,0:01:16.780
Guided by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the man in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:01:16.780,0:01:20.400
I have no feelings from my waist downward.

0:01:20.400,0:01:25.440
The lightning of God pours through the man of God as he prays into the man's injured leg

0:01:25.440,0:01:30.680
which begins to lift off the ground and shake uncontrollably as the Spirit of God

0:01:30.680,0:01:35.560
strikes the root of the pain and brings instant healing in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:01:35.560,0:01:37.800
Stand up!

0:01:37.800,0:01:39.480
Walk!

0:01:39.480,0:01:42.680
Thank God! Thank You, Lord! Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:42.680,0:01:47.360
Thank You, Jesus! I am so happy!

0:01:47.360,0:01:50.700
Oh my God! Lord, thank You! I can walk!

0:01:50.700,0:02:00.020
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:00.020,0:02:03.840
My name is Charles Ude. I am a Nigerian living in the United States.

0:02:03.840,0:02:06.700
Thank you, sir. Who is the gentleman standing next to you?

0:02:06.700,0:02:11.360
The next person that is standing next to me is my brother Bernet Ude Eze.

0:02:11.360,0:02:16.660
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of difficulty in walking.

0:02:16.660,0:02:20.820
I had numbness of my leg and that is where it started.

0:02:20.820,0:02:24.280
It came from my waist down. It was numb.

0:02:24.280,0:02:28.360
I had surgery on my back because of trying to alleviate the problem

0:02:28.360,0:02:34.020
but it didn't work so I tried everything; it was not working.

0:02:34.020,0:02:42.960
I was using a lumbar corset to sit up straight and a knee brace to help me.

0:02:42.960,0:02:50.020
Ok, sir, tell us - how has this problem of numbness and difficulty in walking affected your life in all areas?

0:02:50.020,0:02:52.760
It affected my life in everything I do in life.

0:02:52.760,0:02:57.580
As a human being, I just couldn't do anything for myself because of that.

0:02:57.580,0:03:00.660
It's just like from here alive and this part dead.

0:03:00.660,0:03:03.200
So it was very bad and difficult for me.

0:03:03.200,0:03:06.720
So truly this problem had crippled you in a very real sense.

0:03:06.720,0:03:07.920
Yes, it did.

0:03:07.920,0:03:11.900
Ok, so tell us about your career - how was that impacted?

0:03:11.900,0:03:19.220
I had stopped working because I couldn't do anything. I was working in the nursing field.

0:03:19.220,0:03:23.120
But because of that, I stopped working; for two and a half years, I couldn't do anything.

0:03:23.120,0:03:28.440
Just to get better, I was using my vacation hours to get paid till it got depleted.

0:03:28.440,0:03:33.100
Then I stopped working completely; then, I went for surgery.

0:03:33.100,0:03:37.180
During that time, how would you move around if you needed to go out,

0:03:37.180,0:03:40.340
go to a hospital or go to different places?

0:03:40.340,0:03:47.140
With the help of my wife and some friends sometimes too and a walking aid to move around.

0:03:47.140,0:03:51.980
They even gave me a sticker.

0:03:51.980,0:03:54.220
They gave me a sticker to be moving around.

0:03:54.220,0:03:58.380
But before that time, I was using the Anointing Water my brother sent to me.

0:03:58.380,0:04:01.200
Before that time, before the Anointing Water came...

0:04:01.200,0:04:05.260
The first one was sent to me, the pastor where I was worshipping told me,

0:04:05.260,0:04:09.020
"It is not good; don't use it".

0:04:09.020,0:04:12.300
He kept on telling me to bring it so that we could destroy it.

0:04:12.300,0:04:15.120
After a long time, I brought it.

0:04:15.120,0:04:19.400
When I brought it out, he then lit it up to burn it.

0:04:19.400,0:04:21.940
It was burning.

0:04:21.940,0:04:26.080
The water was not putting out the fire as supposed to

0:04:26.080,0:04:29.940
but rather it was burning like a spirit with the fire.

0:04:29.940,0:04:34.500
And I got scared, and I saw the power of what was being destroyed.

0:04:34.500,0:04:37.460
I prayed to God, "Please, God, forgive me for what I have done.

0:04:37.460,0:04:42.560
I don't know what I did. Forgive me" and then it burnt completely.

0:04:42.560,0:04:46.080
Wow. So I hope we have all understood what our brother is explaining

0:04:46.080,0:04:49.720
of how during the course of this problem where he was unable to walk

0:04:49.720,0:04:54.140
without the assistance of a walker and without people carrying him at home,

0:04:54.140,0:04:58.580
our brother standing next to him, the pastor send the Morning Water

0:04:58.580,0:05:04.160
which he had received here at The SCOAN to our brother to be using for his situation.

0:05:04.160,0:05:08.760
However, he was discouraged from using the Morning Water by his pastor

0:05:08.760,0:05:13.780
back in his country, in the United States that it was not a good thing to use

0:05:13.780,0:05:18.460
and when he was eventually deceived into bringing the Morning Water to be destroyed,

0:05:18.460,0:05:23.500
instead of when you put fire on the water for it to be quenched, it started burning

0:05:23.500,0:05:30.140
as if it was not water inside but instead he saw the power of the Holy Spirit as it was going.

0:05:30.140,0:05:35.120
And that convinced him, and that touched his heart to say, "Oh my goodness, I made a big mistake.

0:05:35.120,0:05:38.340
I have destroyed a gift of God that God had given to me".

0:05:38.340,0:05:40.660
So what happened after then?

0:05:40.660,0:05:43.840
So then he send me another one that I was using.

0:05:43.840,0:05:48.440
When I started using it, that's when I was able to move around better than I was doing before

0:05:48.440,0:05:52.140
and was able to come down here to seek for the face of the Lord.

0:05:52.140,0:05:56.560
So just that we can really understand, sir: Describe how you were that time

0:05:56.560,0:06:01.360
when your brother send the Morning Water to you before you were able to come to the SCOAN.

0:06:01.360,0:06:04.020
How would you move around? How was daily life?

0:06:04.020,0:06:06.580
I couldn't move, I couldn't do anything.

0:06:06.580,0:06:16.880
I couldn't move without any help unless with my walking aid, knee brace and lumbar corset.

0:06:16.880,0:06:20.680
That helped me to move - my walking aid.

0:06:20.680,0:06:25.760
Ok. When your brother send the Morning Water and you were able to start using it,

0:06:25.760,0:06:27.720
what were the changes you started seeing?

0:06:27.720,0:06:31.180
I started having some feelings - a little bit, to move around.

0:06:31.180,0:06:35.460
I could get up after I started ministering the Morning Water.

0:06:35.460,0:06:40.940
And then I could feel my legs sometimes - trembling a little bit so feelings started coming.

0:06:40.940,0:06:46.580
Then, my feet used to burn when I put them on the ground; they used to burn like fire.

0:06:46.580,0:06:49.180
And then there was none, it got better.

0:06:49.180,0:06:51.800
So it helped me a little bit to come down here.

0:06:51.800,0:06:54.820
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:54.820,0:06:57.700
Charles Ude & Brother
Healing Testimony

0:06:57.700,0:07:02.380
Before we get further, sir, we can see some items on the board there.

0:07:02.380,0:07:08.760
Can you tell us what these items are and what they were for.

0:07:08.760,0:07:13.800
This on the board here was a handicap sticker that was given to me by the doctors

0:07:13.800,0:07:19.160
because they tested my nerves and everything and said I was severely damaged.

0:07:19.160,0:07:23.060
Then they gave me this to help me to get closer to the buildings to where I was going.

0:07:23.060,0:07:28.640
So when I parked on handicap places, I wouldn't have to walk very far to the buildings.

0:07:28.640,0:07:34.660
So this is a sticker only given to people who are diagnosed as handicapped by hospitals.

0:07:34.660,0:07:35.280
Exactly.

0:07:35.280,0:07:43.140
In order to assist them around the city, to park their car or to be able to move in preference areas.

0:07:43.140,0:07:44.460
Exactly; it is true.

0:07:44.460,0:07:46.280
Alright and what is the other document?

0:07:46.280,0:07:54.660
Now this one here: They booked me for tumor abrasions, for my cervical and thoracic for surgery.

0:07:54.660,0:07:55.840
Then I said no.

0:07:55.840,0:07:58.120
Then my brother said, "No, don't do anymore surgeries".

0:07:58.120,0:08:02.320
Before anymore surgeries, I should come back here and seek the face of the Lord.

0:08:02.320,0:08:06.680
Hallelujah! And indeed, we did see you come to The SCOAN last week.

0:08:06.680,0:08:10.240
So tell us: What was your experience when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:08:10.240,0:08:12.020
was moving through the congregation?

0:08:12.020,0:08:16.200
Please take time and describe to us when he prayed for you, what was your experience?

0:08:16.200,0:08:19.660
He was moving around and I was calling on him to come.

0:08:19.660,0:08:23.640
When he finally came to me, he tapped me on the head.

0:08:23.640,0:08:28.400
I felt like a shock all over my body and then my body felt light.

0:08:28.400,0:08:30.840
And then from my leg - I started having feelings.

0:08:30.840,0:08:34.220
Then he started praying for my leg, for the healing.

0:08:34.220,0:08:38.760
My leg was kind of moving and then he told me to get up.

0:08:38.760,0:08:42.320
When I got up, he then tapped me on the back and he said, "Walk".

0:08:42.320,0:08:44.580
I couldn't believe it.

0:08:44.580,0:08:47.880
But when I took my first step, second one, I said, "Wow"; I was doing it.

0:08:47.880,0:08:52.100
Then I said, "Thank You, Jesus, I am healed". I have been walking ever since then.

0:08:52.100,0:08:54.980
I have not taken any medication since that day up till now.

0:08:54.980,0:08:59.260
Then, I took medications three times a day. I have not touched them at all.

0:08:59.260,0:09:02.860
Come on, put your hands together for Jesus!

0:09:02.860,0:09:07.080
If you know that Jesus Christ is going to touch your case just like he touched our brother's life,

0:09:07.080,0:09:12.980
let's see your excitement!

0:09:12.980,0:09:16.400
So in just that moment, as we are seeing on the screen right now,

0:09:16.400,0:09:20.180
we can see the very encounter when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for our brother

0:09:20.180,0:09:22.680
told him to stand up, tapped him and said, "Walk".

0:09:22.680,0:09:25.500
And there he is walking to the glory of God.

0:09:25.500,0:09:30.160
So tell us, at that exact moment, when the man of God touched you and loosed the lumbar corset,

0:09:30.160,0:09:34.140
and loosed the knee brace, what were you feeling in your leg, feeling in your body?

0:09:34.140,0:09:36.660
I started having some feelings going down my legs.

0:09:36.660,0:09:42.200
When I touched my legs, I could feel it. Before, I couldn't feel anything.

0:09:42.200,0:09:45.380
My children used to stamp on my feet to put life in them.

0:09:45.380,0:09:49.080
I didn't feel anything then, no feeling but now, I can feel stuff.

0:09:49.080,0:09:54.820
Wow! And then when the man of God now prayed for your leg and it started shaking and moving,

0:09:54.820,0:09:56.940
Were you able to move your leg like that before?

0:09:56.940,0:10:04.420
No, never. I couldn't even lift my leg one inch off the ground but I can do this now.

0:10:04.420,0:10:09.480
Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:09.480,0:10:13.240
So you mean it was impossible for you to be moving your legs like this, sir, before the prayer?

0:10:13.240,0:10:16.540
I couldn't do it. One inch off the ground, I could not lift.

0:10:16.540,0:10:19.980
It would be like I was lifting 10 bags of cement.

0:10:19.980,0:10:22.760
Wow! And now here you are exercising.

0:10:22.760,0:10:27.460
We want to also ask you, sir, to do some exercises right now, to stand up and walk

0:10:27.460,0:10:32.260
and show the people of God what you can do after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:10:32.260,0:10:37.480
Charles Ude & Brother
Healing Testimony

0:10:37.480,0:10:42.100
There he goes marching like a soldier; you can see him walking easily now.

0:10:42.100,0:10:45.460
This is what was impossible for him to do for the past several years

0:10:45.460,0:10:48.620
because of this problem of numbness, and pain from the waist

0:10:48.620,0:10:53.600
that had caused him to be bed ridden, giving him severe difficulty in walking.

0:10:53.600,0:10:56.000
Sir, as you are moving around, as you are walking,

0:10:56.000,0:10:58.580
how are you feeling? Is there any pain or problem?

0:10:58.580,0:11:02.700
Not really, no. It feels great walking around.

0:11:02.700,0:11:03.680
You are healed.

0:11:03.680,0:11:05.300
Yes, I am healed, in Jesus' name.

0:11:05.300,0:11:10.840
Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:11:10.840,0:11:15.260
Hallelujah! We want to hear a word of advice from you in a moment but before then,

0:11:15.260,0:11:18.120
we would like to hear from the gentleman that came with you.

0:11:18.120,0:11:20.060
Si,r you are welcome, in Jesus' name.

0:11:20.060,0:11:22.960
Please introduce yourself to us and the congregation.

0:11:22.960,0:11:35.220
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:11:35.220,0:11:44.060
Brethren, my name is Pastor Ben Eze Udeze.

0:11:44.060,0:11:48.920
I'm from Enungu, Nigeria.

0:11:48.920,0:11:52.960
The Founder of Calvary Love Ministry.

0:11:52.960,0:11:54.200
Praise the Lord.

0:11:54.200,0:11:55.300
Hallelujah!

0:11:55.300,0:12:03.100
Charlie is my brother; he called me and told me that he wasn't feeling fine.

0:12:03.100,0:12:07.020
I said, "Wow, what's the problem?"

0:12:07.020,0:12:17.280
He said his leg could not raise up and he would undergo surgery.

0:12:17.280,0:12:20.980
I asked, "Surgery?" and he said, "Yes".

0:12:20.980,0:12:22.980
I said, "Okay".

0:12:22.980,0:12:26.960
The US is far different from Nigeria.

0:12:26.960,0:12:37.360
I told him I would go and talk to my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:12:37.360,0:12:45.960
and truly, I came here and received the Morning Water.

0:12:45.960,0:12:53.100
I sent it to him; praise the Lord!

0:12:53.100,0:13:07.620
When I sent the first one to him, he said that the pastor of the church he was attending

0:13:07.620,0:13:13.620
told him to bring the Morning Water to him, that it is not of God.

0:13:13.620,0:13:19.720
Then, he gave it to him and he set it on fire.

0:13:19.720,0:13:22.080
And the thing could not burn.

0:13:22.080,0:13:34.740
They thought that the water would quench the fire but it failed.

0:13:34.740,0:13:44.420
What he saw there was that the water was working as if there was something on it - Spirit.

0:13:44.420,0:13:48.660
Praise the Lord!

0:13:48.660,0:13:55.840
Then, that one was gone just like that.

0:13:55.840,0:14:00.240
Then after that, I sent him another one.

0:14:00.240,0:14:05.760
That one enabled him to come out of pain.

0:14:05.760,0:14:11.560
Then I told him that it was high time he came back to Nigeria,

0:14:11.560,0:14:21.520
that he wouldn't need surgery anymore because we have a fire house in Nigeria.

0:14:21.520,0:14:23.180
Praise the Lord!

0:14:23.180,0:14:27.800
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:14:27.800,0:14:32.060
So this was what convinced your brother that "Oh, this was a mistake!

0:14:32.060,0:14:36.060
What I actually needed is what I have now destroyed". Is that right?

0:14:36.060,0:14:40.380
Yes, that propelled me to give him another one.

0:14:40.380,0:14:41.400
Praise the Lord!

0:14:41.400,0:14:42.620
Hallelujah.

0:14:42.620,0:14:43.820
Amen.

Pastor Ben Eze Udeze & Brother
Healing Testimony

0:14:47.600,0:14:53.700
I told him to come down and he came.

0:14:53.700,0:15:02.160
I told him, "Let's go to the House of God", and he followed me just like that.

0:15:02.160,0:15:09.240
We came here and the man of God touched him.

0:15:09.240,0:15:15.960
Death left him; life entered automatically.

0:15:15.960,0:15:18.220
Praise the Lord!

0:15:18.220,0:15:23.780
Life entered automatically.

0:15:23.780,0:15:29.780
There is God here.

0:15:29.780,0:15:30.840
Praise the Lord!

0:15:30.840,0:15:35.180
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:35.180,0:15:37.480
You are seeing on the screen right now the very moment

0:15:37.480,0:15:41.000
where Prophet T.B. Joshua touched our brother in the name of Jesus Christ

0:15:41.000,0:15:44.840
and the life of God began to enter every part of his system

0:15:44.840,0:15:49.800
that had been dead, damaged and dormant and there he is walking for the glory of God.

0:15:49.800,0:15:55.580
Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!

0:15:55.580,0:15:56.680
Yes.

0:15:56.680,0:16:00.340
So since then, sir, what have been the changes you have noticed in our brother.

0:16:00.340,0:16:03.540
My brother has been walking with me.

0:16:03.540,0:16:16.100
When we entered the plane to come here, I was not happy, seeing him with a crutch

0:16:16.100,0:16:20.500
but now, I am smiling; I am feeling free.

0:16:20.500,0:16:25.880
I have confidence because I came to the mountain of God, not mountain of man.

0:16:25.880,0:16:30.800
The mountain of man faileth but the mountain of God stands sure.

0:16:30.800,0:16:32.100
Praise the Lord!

0:16:32.100,0:16:36.500
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:16:36.500,0:16:40.120
So, sir, now seeing what God Almighty has done in the life of your brother,

0:16:40.120,0:16:42.900
what is your word of advice to people watching all over the world?

0:16:42.900,0:16:51.080
Wow! People of God, the whole world watching me right now,

0:16:51.080,0:16:55.540
I say, let us go to the House of God.

0:16:55.540,0:17:01.980
Let us go; forget about the protocols you have or problem you may have.

0:17:01.980,0:17:06.760
The solution is here in the arena of liberty; let's go!

0:17:06.760,0:17:08.000
Praise the Lord!

0:17:08.000,0:17:12.680
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:17:12.680,0:17:16.060
A wonderful word of advice that no matter what problem you have,

0:17:16.060,0:17:19.400
the solution is only with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ

0:17:19.400,0:17:23.200
who works in every one of his living churches all over the world.

0:17:23.200,0:17:27.220
So make sure you find a living church and run to God whenever you have a problem,

0:17:27.220,0:17:33.300
instead of running from Him. Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!

0:17:33.300,0:17:38.020
Lastly, we want to hear a word of advice from our brother who received his wonderful healing today.

0:17:38.020,0:17:41.660
Sir, tell us your advice to people watching all over the world.

0:17:41.660,0:17:45.280
People of God, whatever problem you have, my advice is:

0:17:45.280,0:17:49.620
Whatever problem you are having in this world, no matter what it is,

0:17:49.620,0:17:53.520
don't run from God, run to Him; there is solution there.

0:17:53.520,0:17:56.680
Regardless of what it is, whatever you are going through,

0:17:56.680,0:17:58.800
run to God, don't run away from Him.

0:17:58.800,0:18:02.600
Running away from Him is the biggest mistake you make in your life.

0:18:02.600,0:18:04.320
That's what I have to say.

0:18:04.320,0:18:09.040
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:18:09.040,0:18:14.180
A sound word of advice and, sir, we thank God Almighty for this wonderful healing you have received

0:18:14.180,0:18:17.360
and we encourage you: You have been healed through the Word of God.

0:18:17.360,0:18:20.120
So continue to make God's Word the standard for your life

0:18:20.120,0:18:23.580
and this healing shall remain permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:18:23.580,0:18:24.900
Amen!

0:18:24.900,0:18:31.940
Two weeks after his healing, Mr Ude is not only strong physically but spiritually as well.

0:18:31.940,0:18:34.900
Before going back to the US, to his surprise,

0:18:34.900,0:18:39.600
Prophet T.B. Joshua supports Mr Ude with a financial gift as well.

0:18:39.600,0:18:40.640
Let's watch.

0:18:40.640,0:18:46.000
My name is Charles Ude. I am a Nigerian living in USA.

0:18:46.000,0:18:48.420
Thank you, sir, and who is the gentleman standing next to you?

0:18:48.420,0:18:50.300
That is my brother Bennett Eze.

0:18:50.300,0:18:56.740
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of difficulty in walking.

0:18:56.740,0:19:02.880
Then, I had a lumbar corset I was using that helped me sit up straight, stand up straight

0:19:02.880,0:19:05.620
and do a lot of stuff that I couldn't do well.

0:19:05.620,0:19:08.140
Even though I was wearing it, it was not helping me.

0:19:08.140,0:19:10.600
I was wearing a knee brace.

0:19:10.600,0:19:14.520
I used to have a walking aid to help me move around a little bit.

0:19:14.520,0:19:19.060
The problem affected my daily life so much that I could not do anything.

0:19:19.060,0:19:23.080
I had two little children - 5 and 3.

0:19:23.080,0:19:26.200
I couldn't even play with them. I couldn't even teach them how to ride bikes.

0:19:26.200,0:19:27.900
I could not do anything for them

0:19:27.900,0:19:30.900
and the children didn't understand what was going on with daddy.

0:19:30.900,0:19:35.580
When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me and prayed for me,

0:19:35.580,0:19:38.000
I was able to get up and started walking.

0:19:38.000,0:19:40.540
Ever since then, I have been walking and walking around.

0:19:40.540,0:19:45.240
I never want to stop walking around because it is something that I never thought I could...

0:19:45.240,0:19:47.460
The devil would deny me walking.

0:19:47.460,0:19:52.860
But now through the help of the man of God, I have been healed and walking around.

0:19:52.860,0:19:58.540
Glory be to God. I thank God for using the man of God to help me.

0:19:58.540,0:20:01.980
Amen! To God be the glory. So since the man of God has prayed for you,

0:20:01.980,0:20:05.120
how many days has it been and what are the changes you have seen?

0:20:05.120,0:20:07.620
It's going to two weeks now.

0:20:07.620,0:20:10.360
The changes have been tremendous.

0:20:10.360,0:20:13.600
I just can't explain; there are no words to explain the entire changes,

0:20:13.600,0:20:17.100
that I have been getting from this - the happiness, everything about it.

0:20:17.100,0:20:22.300
Even people that know me, when they see me, they say, "Oh your face is glowing right now..

0:20:22.300,0:20:26.780
It's just too much. It's unimaginable.

0:20:26.780,0:20:29.400
I'm so happy about it.

0:20:29.400,0:20:30.880
Wow! To God be the glory!

0:20:30.880,0:20:35.860
Well, that's it. The Bible promises us that the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed

0:20:35.860,0:20:39.200
and you are telling us your life has changed to the glory of God.

0:20:39.200,0:20:41.040
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:20:41.040,0:20:43.740
I am Pastor Ben Eze.

0:20:43.740,0:20:54.640
Before, he could not walk but since he came here, after the man of God touched him,

0:20:54.640,0:20:59.820
healing entered, life entered and now, he has started walking.

0:20:59.820,0:21:06.160
He can walk with me; we have stayed here almost two weeks and he has been walking.

0:21:06.160,0:21:10.520
I feel happy; I feel joy. Glory be to God!

0:21:10.520,0:21:14.820
Amen! And as a minister of the Gospel, how has this impacted on your faith,

0:21:14.820,0:21:18.520
seeing what God has done to someone close to you?

0:21:18.520,0:21:25.580
Beautiful! It has encouraged me that walking in the way of God is the most important thing.

0:21:25.580,0:21:33.580
God called me but it is not like this; I am seeing this, it has propelled me high

0:21:33.580,0:21:37.500
with the hope that God has something to do with me tomorrow.

0:21:37.500,0:21:38.900
Praise the Lord!

0:21:38.900,0:21:40.680
Hallelujah! Thank you very much, sir.

0:21:40.680,0:21:43.760
And lastly, what is your word of advice to people watching all over the world

0:21:43.760,0:21:48.940
who are in a position you were in, to be of help and assistance to someone in need?

0:21:48.940,0:21:57.920
I have friends outside and inside - I have been calling them, telling them that they should come.

0:21:57.920,0:22:03.260
There is power in the house.

0:22:03.260,0:22:09.080
I told a lot of them, "Let us go to Emmanuel TV - there is something happening,

0:22:09.080,0:22:14.300
miracles are happening and you can see God in His nature here".

0:22:14.300,0:22:18.220
Praise the Lord! Let us go; it is good. Amen.

0:22:18.220,0:22:20.700
Amen! Thank you very much. What a wonderful comment, sir.

0:22:20.700,0:22:23.320
So let's hear from our brother once again. Mr Charles.

0:22:23.320,0:22:26.140
His word of advice to people all over the world

0:22:26.140,0:22:28.940
who has seen what the power of God has done in his life.

0:22:28.940,0:22:34.220
My advice is: No matter what you are going through, look for the face of God.

0:22:34.220,0:22:37.440
Disregard what people are saying about the face of God,

0:22:37.440,0:22:41.020
especially Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:41.020,0:22:43.000
That man is a lion.

0:22:43.000,0:22:48.560
That man - God uses him in so many ways;

0:22:48.560,0:22:51.460
in so many ways that you can't even imagine.

0:22:51.460,0:22:54.240
He is in everything, helping everybody.

0:22:54.240,0:22:57.180
He doesn't care how big you are or how small you are.

0:22:57.180,0:22:59.060
He sees everybody equal.

0:22:59.060,0:23:00.740
The man is great.

0:23:00.740,0:23:05.460
I thank God and my advice is: Whatever you are going through, look for the face of God.

0:23:05.460,0:23:08.560
What is your plan for the future? What is the next step for you?

0:23:08.560,0:23:14.120
My plan is to go back to the USA where I came down from and continue from where I left off.

0:23:14.120,0:23:18.180
And with the prayers the man of God has given me,

0:23:18.180,0:23:21.460
I believe he has opened all the doors of greatness for me.

0:23:21.460,0:23:23.740
So I know the sky is my limit right now.

0:23:23.740,0:23:26.300
I know that progress won't stop coming.

0:23:26.300,0:23:29.920
It's going to be coming from everywhere, from all angles, in Jesus' name.

0:23:29.920,0:23:34.600
It is our pleasure to present you on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

0:23:34.600,0:23:39.940
the sum of N150 000 as financial support and a copy of The Mirror.

0:23:39.940,0:23:44.860
Wow! Thank God and I thank God for Emmanuel TV.

0:23:44.860,0:23:46.980
I came to get healing, I got healing.

0:23:46.980,0:23:52.800
Not only did I get healing, I also got financial support to support me.

0:23:52.800,0:23:58.580
God is great and I pray to God to continue to use Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:23:58.580,0:24:03.140
to help so many people and touch so many lives and change so many lives all over the world.

0:24:03.140,0:24:07.540
And Emmanuel TV Partners to continue to do the good work they do.

0:24:07.540,0:24:10.980
God uses them in so many ways regardless of who you are.

0:24:10.980,0:24:14.520
I thank God and I thank Emmanuel TV for everything they have done for me.

0:24:14.520,0:24:18.180
He healed me and then he also gave me financial support.

0:24:18.180,0:24:20.300
To God be the glory. Amen!

0:24:20.300,0:24:22.620
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:24:22.620,0:24:25.400
Thank You, Jesus!
