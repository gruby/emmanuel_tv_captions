express our deepest condolences to the government of Nigeria,

the government of South Africa, and the governments of other affected nations,

0:06:02.100,0:06:08.780
most especially the families, friends, and loved ones of the precious souls

0:06:08.780,0:06:20.200
who lost their lives in the tragic incident which occurred on Friday, September 12, 2014.

0:06:20.200,0:06:30.880
May Almighty God console all and give courage and strength to bear the grievous losses.

Death to a believer is his release from the imprisonment of this world

0:06:45.160,0:06:51.220
and his departure to the enjoyment of another world.

0:06:51.220,0:06:56.100
Those who are born from above long to be there.

0:06:56.100,0:07:05.500
Those who lost their lives in the incident died not in vain but as martyrs of the Kingdom of God.

0:07:05.500,0:07:16.220
As the Psalmist reflects, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints" (Psalm 116:15).

0:07:16.220,0:07:24.020
God's everlasting promise is to comfort all who mourn, provide for those who grieve,

0:07:24.020,0:07:30.980
to bestow on them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning

0:07:30.980,0:07:36.940
and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair (Isaiah 61:3).

0:07:36.940,0:07:43.880
Trouble may endure for the night but joy comes in the morning!

0:07:43.880,0:07:48.640
