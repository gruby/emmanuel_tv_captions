0:00:00.100,0:00:01.880
There is a woman there.

0:00:01.880,0:00:09.000
In those days, in your past, you used to wear some beads.

0:00:09.000,0:00:15.600
You have done away with these beads. You no longer wear beads but now,

0:00:15.600,0:00:19.540
the challenge you are facing now is you have no settled home.

0:00:19.540,0:00:23.500
No single man can please you.

0:00:23.500,0:00:29.180
No one can give you the kind of affection you want.

0:00:29.180,0:00:32.840
This has bastardised your career.

0:00:32.840,0:00:36.280
You are just from one place to another. But right now, you are tired.

0:00:36.280,0:00:38.360
You don't know what is wrong with you.

0:00:38.360,0:00:41.220
Please come out, Jesus loves you.

0:00:41.220,0:00:44.100
You are there, you are getting old.

0:00:44.100,0:00:48.860
And this will tell on your children. You are there.

0:00:48.860,0:00:51.520
You were wearing beads in the past.

0:00:51.520,0:00:55.060
Right now, you have stopped using them for a long time.

0:00:55.060,0:01:00.080
There is a problem you have. You have no settled home. You move from one place to another.

0:01:00.080,0:01:04.340
No one can give you what you want. Please come, come out. Jesus loves you.

0:01:04.340,0:01:06.260
You`ve put on a native. Thank you.

0:01:06.260,0:01:11.800
Prophecy time.

0:01:11.800,0:01:16.380
My name is Sylvia Ogbebor. I'm from Nigeria.

0:01:16.380,0:01:23.020
What the Man of God said, that a lady was wearing beads before.

0:01:23.020,0:01:25.800
In my school days, I was always putting on those beads.

0:01:25.800,0:01:36.400
I got married in 2012. A one year old marriage and we broke up after one year with a child.

0:01:36.400,0:01:38.180
The child is with me.

0:01:38.180,0:01:48.140
Now, I can`t stay with any man who can satisfy me. I don`t see anything good in any man.

0:01:48.140,0:01:56.560
Then I travelled from one country to another, looking for men.

0:01:56.560,0:02:03.600
I have been to Dubai like five times and Turkey doing prostitution.

0:02:03.600,0:02:05.660
Man of God, please help me.

0:02:05.660,0:02:07.620
That is why I called you out.

0:02:07.620,0:02:17.260
No one can get you out of this mess. Unless the person sees the need of destroying those beads.

0:02:17.260,0:02:19.100
Simple.

0:02:19.100,0:02:28.160
It takes the grace of God to see those beads.

0:02:28.160,0:02:34.440
If ten men queue, they cannot satisfy you. It's a curse.

0:02:34.440,0:02:39.620
So you believed nobody can satisfy you in Nigeria - "let me go to Dubai" .

0:02:39.620,0:02:44.480
"Okay let me live my life and let them be enjoying me" - yet you cannot be satisfied;

0:02:44.480,0:02:46.620
it's a curse.

0:02:46.620,0:02:52.460
So, don't worry. You will give testimony. That is why I called you. It will be over.

0:02:52.460,0:02:56.920
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:56.920,0:02:58.080
It is over.

0:02:58.080,0:03:02.200
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:03:02.200,0:03:06.340
That was the message of prophecy from the anointed Man of God.

0:03:06.340,0:03:09.720
And the last word was, "it is over".

0:03:09.720,0:03:14.900
This prophecy brought about deliverance in the life of this sister.

0:03:14.900,0:03:20.500
And she is back here today, to testify to the goodness of God in her life.

0:03:20.500,0:03:25.900
The importance of prophecy in the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot be over-emphasised.

0:03:25.900,0:03:28.720
Remember all the words the Man of God said in his prophecy

0:03:28.720,0:03:34.400
are things that are very difficult for anyone to come out and talk about, to share with people.

0:03:34.400,0:03:40.480
And today, whatever you are going to hear from our sister is not meant to deride her

0:03:40.480,0:03:46.460
but to give glory to God Almighty because confession is also part of deliverance.

0:03:46.460,0:03:51.720
So right now, she wants to share her experience and also share her testimony to the glory of God.

0:03:51.720,0:03:52.940
So let us listen to her.

0:03:52.940,0:03:57.980
Sister, once again we welcome you to The SCOAN. Can you please introduce yourself

0:03:57.980,0:04:00.880
and let us hear your experience and your testimony.

0:04:00.880,0:04:03.660
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:03.660,0:04:06.820
My name is Ogbebor Sylvia.

0:04:06.820,0:04:13.780
This is my mother, Mrs Veronica Ogbebor, and my son.

0:04:13.780,0:04:19.360
Last Sunday, I was here with a lot of expectation.

0:04:19.360,0:04:26.660
While I was sitting, the Man of God came very close to me and then he left.

0:04:26.660,0:04:35.640
My courage was almost gone, but when he came again, he said if you have a grudge,

0:04:35.640,0:04:39.560
against anyone, we should forgive them.

0:04:39.560,0:04:43.300
Ask the Holy Spirit to come to you, and then you should forgive.

0:04:43.300,0:04:48.940
Immediately, I sat down and said this prayer is not for me.

0:04:48.940,0:04:51.800
It's too painful, that I can't even forgive him.

0:04:51.800,0:04:56.340
Then, he walked down again and said, "I say you should forgive".

0:04:56.340,0:05:03.180
Then, I stood up and said, "I have forgiven him" and at that moment he mentioned my case.

0:05:03.180,0:05:07.820
He prophesied and said there is a lady who wore beads before

0:05:07.820,0:05:09.980
but has done away with them.

0:05:09.980,0:05:16.540
He said because of those beads, I could not make a home and they had spoiled my career

0:05:16.540,0:05:20.040
and that I could not stay with a man.

0:05:20.040,0:05:24.140
He said it will affect my children and that I was getting old.

0:05:24.140,0:05:29.000
These are the things that I had been sitting and thinking about alone for the past three weeks,

0:05:29.000,0:05:32.560
wondering where this problem is coming from.

0:05:32.560,0:05:35.180
When he mentioned it, I came out.

0:05:35.180,0:05:40.320
He said that my case would be settled and that I would share my testimony.

0:05:40.320,0:05:43.940
Really, what the Man of God said is true.

0:05:43.940,0:05:49.860
In those days when I was 22 years old, my neighbour called me

0:05:49.860,0:05:52.740
and said that I should follow her somewhere.

0:05:52.740,0:05:57.980
On getting to that place, there was a spiritualist who told her that they would perform

0:05:57.980,0:06:04.520
some rituals on me, like giving me a mark on my private parts and giving me beads

0:06:04.520,0:06:07.000
as an object of seduction on my waist.

0:06:07.000,0:06:10.900
All that while, it was uncontrollable.

0:06:10.900,0:06:16.240
Then I got an admission. While I was in school, I was moving from one place to another.

0:06:16.240,0:06:21.700
I went to Abuja, Port Harcourt and Ghana, doing prostitution.

0:06:21.700,0:06:27.840
At the end of the day, during my 300 level, I had an encounter with a ritualist,

0:06:27.840,0:06:33.000
which made me say, "I have to quit this before I die".

0:06:33.000,0:06:38.660
Then after my graduation in 2010, I went back to my mother's house in Lagos.

0:06:38.660,0:06:44.140
That was when I met the man that I had a baby for.

0:06:44.140,0:06:48.900
I also had a group of friends that were into prostitution too.

0:06:48.900,0:06:56.980
One of them asked me, "Why are you like this? You are no longer pretty, you are looking so unkempt".

0:06:56.980,0:06:59.500
I told them that I was not doing prostitution anymore,

0:06:59.500,0:07:02.360
that I had changed and was serving God.

0:07:02.360,0:07:05.940
They said, "This is not how to serve God. They have brainwashed you".

0:07:05.940,0:07:09.600
They said that I should take them to Abuja since I had been there before.

0:07:09.600,0:07:11.840
I should show them the way and where they should go.

0:07:11.840,0:07:17.560
I told them that I don't have money to do all of that. They then transported me down to Abuja.

0:07:17.560,0:07:24.180
We were in a hotel there. I met with an honourable in the National Assembly whom I knew before.

0:07:24.180,0:07:26.920
He gave me some money; then we came back to Lagos.

0:07:26.920,0:07:30.460
By the time we got to Lagos, they asked me what I wanted to do with the money.

0:07:30.460,0:07:35.480
I told them that I wanted to rent a house where I could stay with my mom and rent a shop for business.

0:07:35.480,0:07:41.420
They said  that I should rather travel to Turkey as they had already applied for their visas.

0:07:41.420,0:07:44.680
I agreed with them and applied for my Turkish visa.

0:07:44.680,0:07:49.400
Then, I met with my baby's farther and got pregnant for him.

0:07:49.400,0:07:55.240
Throughout the one year period that I was married to him, it was hell.

0:07:55.240,0:07:58.160
He beat me up so much, even when I was nine months pregnant.

0:07:58.160,0:08:02.880
The doctors examined me and confirmed I would deliver on a Sunday.

0:08:02.880,0:08:05.780
It was on a Friday when they confirmed the Sunday delivery.

0:08:05.780,0:08:08.340
It was on that same Friday when he beat me up.

0:08:08.340,0:08:11.380
My child almost died in the womb; I had to be rushed to the hospital

0:08:11.380,0:08:13.360
where a caesarean section was carried out on me.

0:08:13.360,0:08:16.420
After three months, he threw me out of the house.

0:08:16.420,0:08:17.880
I was serving as a National Youth Service Corps member

0:08:17.880,0:08:19.840
and my mom was in the same house with us.

0:08:19.840,0:08:23.460
He threw me and our child out, so I went back to my mom.

0:08:23.460,0:08:27.240
I was there; after the service, I went back to Abuja.

0:08:27.240,0:08:32.880
Upon getting to Abuja, I met a girl from the same group of girls who were doing prostitution.

0:08:32.880,0:08:38.000
I didn't get the job that I was going there for; she then suggested that we travel to Dubai.

0:08:38.000,0:08:42.180
I said "No", as I had not travelled before and I didn't have money for a visa.

0:08:42.180,0:08:46.960
She said that she would provide the visa for me and that I should just get a flight ticket.

0:08:46.960,0:08:49.520
That was when I started the prostitution again.

0:08:49.520,0:08:55.320
I looked for money for a ticket to go to Dubai and eventually the visa was out.

0:08:55.320,0:09:00.180
I couldn't get the money for the ticket to Dubai. She then said that she would pay for everything.

0:09:00.180,0:09:03.100
and once I got to Dubai, I would pay her back.

0:09:03.100,0:09:07.080
I agreed and we went to Dubai.

0:09:07.080,0:09:11.780
She said that when we get to Dubai, there would be a queue and within two weeks

0:09:11.780,0:09:14.320
I would be able to make the money to pay her back.

0:09:14.320,0:09:19.380
Then, I'd start making my own money to rent a house to stay in, with my mom and child.

0:09:19.380,0:09:21.080
What is the queue all about?

0:09:21.080,0:09:28.400
The queue of men that would be coming into the house where the ladies are staying.

0:09:28.400,0:09:30.900
Upon getting to Dubai,

0:09:30.900,0:09:34.820
I used to see Dubai on the TV. Dubai is a very beautiful place.

0:09:34.820,0:09:40.620
But the particular place she took me to was a market area;

0:09:40.620,0:09:43.600
African people dominated that place.

0:09:43.600,0:09:49.240
I asked her how I was going to start getting money so that I could pay her back immediately.

0:09:49.240,0:09:51.200
She said that that was where I was going to work.

0:09:51.200,0:09:59.740
She took me to a room with four beds; they were divided by curtains.

0:09:59.740,0:10:04.360
Men would come in there.

0:10:04.360,0:10:07.960
I told her that I could not do it. Then, she took my passport.

0:10:07.960,0:10:12.160
They said that I could not leave the country without a passport.

0:10:12.160,0:10:15.340
I had to start doing what she asked me to do, despite the fact that I had stiches

0:10:15.340,0:10:24.300
because after the operation, the wound re-opened; I was still going for treatment to dress the wound.

0:10:24.300,0:10:30.520
Like the Man of God said, even if 10 men queued, I would not get tired, which was true.

0:10:30.520,0:10:33.360
The men were always trooping in.

0:10:33.360,0:10:36.080
So how many men would come to you in a day?

0:10:36.080,0:10:39.160
Between 30 to 40 a day.

0:10:39.160,0:10:45.280
At that point in time, you were still nursing the wound of the operation?

0:10:45.280,0:10:49.580
Yes, I still had the wound which had not yet healed.

0:10:49.580,0:10:56.460
I came back to Nigeria and met my mom with my child in the same condition. They were looking so unkempt.

0:10:56.460,0:11:02.520
I said, "This will not continue" so I went to Abuja and Port Harcourt again to raise some money.

0:11:02.520,0:11:04.000
Then I went back to the same place.

0:11:04.000,0:11:07.320
When you went to Abuja and Port Harcourt, how did you raise money?

0:11:07.320,0:11:08.740
Through prostitution.

0:11:08.740,0:11:13.460
Then I raised money and went back to the same place in Dubai.

0:11:13.460,0:11:20.040
That was how I was able to raise money, I came back and rented a house to put my mom and child there.

0:11:20.040,0:11:24.480
All the time, I was going to and fro Lagos and Dubai.

0:11:24.480,0:11:30.860
I eventually came back in March from Dubai because the last time I went to Dubai,

0:11:30.860,0:11:40.620
whenever I saw a group of people, I could count 5-6 of them who had used and paid me.

0:11:40.620,0:11:46.240
So, all the time I was very shy and scared.

0:11:46.240,0:11:51.600
Then, I moved to the hotel where I used social networks.

0:11:51.600,0:11:56.400
I would always ask my mom to look after my child as I was going to do business.

0:11:56.400,0:11:58.740
Ok, you always told your mom that you were doing business?

0:11:58.740,0:11:59.380
Yes.

0:11:59.380,0:12:03.420
So you mean your mother was not even aware that you were into prostitution?

0:12:03.420,0:12:04.100
Yes.

0:12:04.100,0:12:11.980
By the time I came back, I was sick. I had depression and too many dreams

0:12:11.980,0:12:17.840
that made me feel like I couldn't even close my eyes; if I closed my eyes, I would die.

0:12:17.840,0:12:23.740
At night, I didn't sleep and during the day time, I was always indoors.

0:12:23.740,0:12:29.160
Whenever I was indoors, I would always be busy on my phone, using socal networks to look for men.

0:12:29.160,0:12:34.160
When I came back, my son was really sick. I had to rush him to hospital.

0:12:34.160,0:12:42.000
I was asking myself how was I going to continue with this, it was too much for me.

0:12:42.000,0:12:47.320
I was depressed, I was not sleeping and that urge of sex was always there.

0:12:47.320,0:12:49.560
I wanted to sleep with men.

0:12:49.560,0:12:54.420
With the group of friends that I had, whenever I didn't see a man,

0:12:54.420,0:13:00.380
we would practice lesbianism, smoke marijuana, cigarettes and all that.

0:13:00.380,0:13:02.500
The whole thing became just too much for me

0:13:02.500,0:13:06.920
I asked myself, "My child is growing, how will I be able to continue with this?"

0:13:06.920,0:13:12.120
I told a friend what I was going through. That I couldn't sleep and so,

0:13:12.120,0:13:18.200
I asked her to prescribe drugs for me. There was a drug I used to take that always calmed my nerves.

0:13:18.200,0:13:24.240
I told her that it wasn't working. I asked her to prescribe another drug. She told me all that I needed was sex.

0:13:24.240,0:13:27.620
That was the same lesbian friend who said what I needed was sex.

0:13:27.620,0:13:35.700
That I should meet with a man to sleep with me and that would take away the anxiety.

0:13:35.700,0:13:41.300
Most of the men who gave me money, I didn't enjoy it with them.

0:13:41.300,0:13:48.100
The ones I smoked marijuana and lodged in a hotel with and at the end of the day,

0:13:48.100,0:13:52.200
I would give them money, those were the ones that I called.

0:13:52.200,0:13:58.020
This time, I needed help. So, I told my mom what I was going through. That I couldn't sleep.

0:13:58.020,0:14:04.380
My mom confided in someone who told her that there is a place where she should take me to.

0:14:04.380,0:14:09.540
We went there and the woman said that she would bathe me in the river,

0:14:09.540,0:14:15.540
I bought a lot of things and sew a white garment and we would go to the river.

0:14:15.540,0:14:19.440
The woman said I should bring N80,000 but I did not have that amount.

0:14:19.440,0:14:23.240
We then agreed on N20,000 on Friday.

0:14:23.240,0:14:28.940
On Saturday, a brother called me and said I should try and go to church on that Sunday.

0:14:28.940,0:14:33.640
I agreed and on that Sunday I came to church.

0:14:33.640,0:14:37.520
When I came on that Sunday, the Man of God gave the prophecy.

0:14:37.520,0:14:43.260
I was scared to come out but then, I thought that that was what was happening to me.

0:14:43.260,0:14:45.320
I quickly ran out.

0:14:45.320,0:14:49.680
I needed help so I cried out, "Man of God, please help me! I am depressed".

0:14:49.680,0:14:53.020
He said that I was free and I would share my testimony.

0:14:53.020,0:15:01.600
After my deliverance, I noticed that the whole trouble that was on me like a load,

0:15:01.600,0:15:04.760
I had been relieved of it.

0:15:04.760,0:15:17.020
When I got home, I decided to confirm my deliverance, by seeing if I could sleep.

0:15:17.020,0:15:24.000
When I lied on my bed, I started meditating with my Faith Bracelet.

0:15:24.000,0:15:30.720
I noticed that all of the messages the Man of God preached about, were coming back to me,

0:15:30.720,0:15:36.940
including the one the evangelist preached titled, 'No Shortcut'.

0:15:36.940,0:15:42.660
I kept thinking that all the times I had been moving around were simply shortcuts

0:15:42.660,0:15:46.120
and there are so many sins that go with shortcuts.

0:15:46.120,0:15:48.400
So that is not the right way to go.

0:15:48.400,0:15:53.620
Then I brought out my credentials, thinking they might be useful.

0:15:53.620,0:16:02.700
Then, I noticed that whenever I was meditating with my Faith Bracelet, I could sleep.

0:16:02.700,0:16:08.220
I could just sleep off only to find out later that I was still holding the bracelet in my hand.

0:16:08.220,0:16:10.380
Then I would wear it on my wrist again.

0:16:10.380,0:16:13.280
The bad dreams that I used to have are gone.

0:16:13.280,0:16:20.340
I used to have an urge for sex and could not resist it any time it came.

0:16:20.340,0:16:27.160
So, I tried to lie on my bed to see if that urge would come but it was not coming.

0:16:27.160,0:16:34.120
Rather, the messages I had heard and the books I had read were the things that I was meditating on.

0:16:34.120,0:16:39.680
So, I believe that I have been delivered. Since then I have been sleeping well.

0:16:39.680,0:16:45.080
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:16:45.080,0:16:50.340
In the course of your testimony, you said that you are a university graduate, right?

0:16:50.340,0:16:52.900
Yes.

0:16:52.900,0:16:59.720
And because of this spirit and the urge that had been tormenting you,

0:16:59.720,0:17:04.340
you forgot all about your credentials and your career.

0:17:04.340,0:17:08.660
So it was after your deliverance that you remembered your credentials?

0:17:08.660,0:17:12.840
Yes. The Man of God said it was killing my career.

0:17:12.840,0:17:19.720
Before now, if you asked me what I wanted to do or become, I would have nothing to say.

0:17:19.720,0:17:23.960
Sometimes I was scared, wondering if that was how the world was.

0:17:23.960,0:17:33.020
But later, the things which I had studied, started coming back; ideas were coming.

0:17:33.020,0:17:36.760
I carried my credentials and thought, "Wow! This is actually for me".

0:17:36.760,0:17:40.420
A lot of people I meet out there don't even have this.

0:17:40.420,0:17:43.280
"So, why would I have this and still be doing that?"

0:17:43.280,0:17:45.420
So, I felt happy within myself.

0:17:45.420,0:17:48.220
So now that you're delivered, tell us -

0:17:48.220,0:17:56.180
do you still communicate with those friends that you did this job of prostitution with?

0:17:56.180,0:18:02.980
That Tuesday, when I got home, for two days, I had kept my phone switched off.

0:18:02.980,0:18:09.600
By the time I switched it back on, messages and calls were coming in asking me where I was.

0:18:09.600,0:18:15.440
Previously, I would sit down and say, "Don't worry, we will have food; God will do wonders and miracles".

0:18:15.440,0:18:20.000
And the miracle I was expecting was for a call to come in and I would quickly go,

0:18:20.000,0:18:21.580
and make money and come back.

0:18:21.580,0:18:28.580
These calls and messages came in, asking what had happened, as they hadn't heard from me.

0:18:28.580,0:18:37.100
I deleted and blocked others - the ones I used to send nude pictures to.

0:18:37.100,0:18:40.900
These were the things I was always scared of losing before.

0:18:40.900,0:18:45.140
But I was able to delete those things from my phone.

0:18:45.140,0:18:50.220
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:18:50.220,0:18:54.020
So tell us once again, since you have been delivered last week till now,

0:18:54.020,0:18:59.420
the depression, the urge to smoke or drink - do you still have them?

0:18:59.420,0:19:00.740
No, I don't have them.

0:19:00.740,0:19:05.640
The urge to smoke was always constant before.

0:19:05.640,0:19:11.800
Whenever I would think about things like my baby's father.

0:19:11.800,0:19:13.640
The Man of God said I should forgive.

0:19:13.640,0:19:16.880
Whenever I thought of those things that put me in the condition I was in,

0:19:16.880,0:19:18.200
I wanted to smoke.

0:19:18.200,0:19:23.100
So, I would put on my dress and go to any place where I knew it was convenient for me to smoke.

0:19:23.100,0:19:30.880
But since then, I have not been smoking and that urge is no longer there.

0:19:30.880,0:19:38.120
I have noticed that I am now frequently at home. My child is around me; my children are happy.

0:19:38.120,0:19:41.720
With this mood I am in, I am very happy.

0:19:41.720,0:19:47.000
Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:19:47.000,0:19:51.880
Thank you very much. We will get back to you. In the meantime, let us listen to your mother.

0:19:51.880,0:19:55.160
We believe she also has some experiences to share.

0:19:55.160,0:19:56.980
Mama, you're welcome, in Jesus' name.

0:19:56.980,0:20:03.960
Can you  please tell us your name and share with us the testimony of your daughter's deliverance.

0:20:03.960,0:20:07.440
My name is Veronica Ogbe.

0:20:07.440,0:20:09.220
And the lady beside you?

0:20:09.220,0:20:13.440
She's my last born daughter.

0:20:13.440,0:20:14.580
Kindly go ahead.

0:20:14.580,0:20:22.460
On Sunday, a call came in; she told me she wanted to go to church.

0:20:22.460,0:20:27.860
At around 5 am, she woke up, did her chores and bathed.

0:20:27.860,0:20:36.040
I asked her where she wanted to go to; she replied to church. I asked her which church.

0:20:36.040,0:20:38.860
She said The SCOAN.

0:20:38.860,0:20:42.600
I asked her who will be taking her there. She said one of her friends.

0:20:42.600,0:20:47.780
I thanked God that my child was going to church on that day.

0:20:47.780,0:20:51.400
She then went to church. We went to our own church.

0:20:51.400,0:20:55.600
When we came back, she had not returned yet.

0:20:55.600,0:21:01.520
So I decided to call her to find out if it was really church she went to or elsewhere.

0:21:01.520,0:21:07.800
When I called her, she told me that she was still in church. I thanked God.

0:21:07.800,0:21:14.520
Since God delivered her on Sunday, she has changed!

0:21:14.520,0:21:16.060
Please tell us about those changes.

0:21:16.060,0:21:23.120
She has changed because before, she would not help with anything in the house.

0:21:23.120,0:21:37.480
She would spend a lot of time on her phone.

0:21:37.480,0:21:42.400
I would ask her if she wasn't going to put her phone down and get a job so that we could eat.

0:21:42.400,0:21:44.400
Later, she would go to bed.

0:21:44.400,0:21:49.300
When she woke up, she would shower and then go out in the evening.

0:21:49.300,0:21:56.720
Since Sunday, she has been to the market, she has cleaned the house and worked.

0:21:56.720,0:22:01.380
This baby, she bathes him and washes his clothes and mine also.

0:22:01.380,0:22:05.040
She will go to the market, buy food then come home and cook. We will eat.

0:22:05.040,0:22:06.720
So she never used to do all of those things before?

0:22:06.720,0:22:07.940
Not at all.

0:22:07.940,0:22:12.360
So when she used to go out and travel to Dubai, where did she say she was going to?

0:22:12.360,0:22:19.880
Previously, she told me she was going for business. She never told me what she was really into.

0:22:19.880,0:22:28.540
That Sunday when the Man of God delivered her, I said, "God, I thank You! Man of God, I thank you!"

0:22:28.540,0:22:31.300
Prophecy Testimony

0:22:31.300,0:22:37.020
You have heard from the mother, testifying to the deliverance of the daughter.

0:22:37.020,0:22:42.120
She said she is so happy that God Almighty finally delivered her daughter.

0:22:42.120,0:22:48.000
She never knew that the daughter was into these acts of prostitution for so many years.

0:22:48.000,0:22:52.720
That each time the daughter was travelling out of the country or going out,

0:22:52.720,0:22:56.380
she would ask her where she was going and she would say that she was going for business.

0:22:56.380,0:23:01.920
According to her, she was 24/7 browsing on her phone

0:23:01.920,0:23:04.780
and she wouldn't know what she was exactly looking for,

0:23:04.780,0:23:09.140
not knowing that she was always getting contacts with men on the phone.

0:23:09.140,0:23:13.220
But ever since her daughter has been delivered, she said her attitude has changed.

0:23:13.220,0:23:16.060
Before now, she would not sweep or wash anything.

0:23:16.060,0:23:18.820
She would not even take care of the baby or even take care of the home.

0:23:18.820,0:23:22.560
But now she has started doing all of those things. Her countenance has changed.

0:23:22.560,0:23:25.680
She is now happy. She doesn't go out anymore.

0:23:25.680,0:23:28.200
She stays indoors except when she is coming to church.

0:23:28.200,0:23:30.840
And she said "To God be the glory!"

0:23:30.840,0:23:37.240
Once again let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:23:37.240,0:23:42.160
First, I have something to say about Jesus who delivered me.

0:23:42.160,0:23:51.320
Jesus is faithful and always ready to accept you, no matter the kind of sins you have committed.

0:23:51.320,0:23:54.820
He is always there to tell you, "I love you".

0:23:54.820,0:24:02.860
To everyone listening to my testimony out there, I will tell them that if you are believing God

0:24:02.860,0:24:06.120
for one thing or another, you should always have faith.

0:24:06.120,0:24:09.780
believing that some day, God will answer your prayer.

0:24:09.780,0:24:13.000
And to other people I had met out there.

0:24:13.000,0:24:17.840
There are a lot of ladies I have met out there; some have two children, others have three

0:24:17.840,0:24:22.360
and they always have one excuse or the other for what lured them into doing what they are doing.

0:24:22.360,0:24:31.420
I want to tell you that that way is a shortcut and there is always sin that goes along with that way.

0:24:31.420,0:24:37.320
Since you are graduating from one level to another, because that was how I was graduating,

0:24:37.320,0:24:43.460
I want to tell you that the way which is very easy, step-by-step,

0:24:43.460,0:24:47.940
is where you find meekness, happiness and peace of mind.

0:24:47.940,0:24:51.460
I want to tell you that Jesus loves you; come back home.

0:24:51.460,0:24:55.740
Come back home. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:24:55.740,0:25:02.900
Yes, come back home. Because the Bible says homelessness is man's condition without Christ.

0:25:02.900,0:25:06.860
And homelessness is a life that is devoid of Christ.

0:25:06.860,0:25:10.600
When Christ is not in our lives, we are homeless.

0:25:10.600,0:25:15.680
So come back home, those who are still in the wilderness of prostitution,

0:25:15.680,0:25:19.940
and all other crimes and vices that do not please God.

0:25:19.940,0:25:24.480
To God be the glory. Now that God Almighty has set you free, we also want to encourage you

0:25:24.480,0:25:29.840
to follow the way that you have discovered, the new life that you have found

0:25:29.840,0:25:32.780
and the love of Jesus that He has shown you.

0:25:32.780,0:25:38.420
Walk in the way of Christ by making His word the standard for your life.

0:25:38.420,0:25:43.080
We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make His word the standard for your life

0:25:43.080,0:25:47.100
and the deliverance you have received will be permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:25:47.100,0:25:48.100
Amen.

0:25:48.100,0:25:50.280
Once again let us clap for Jesus Christ!
