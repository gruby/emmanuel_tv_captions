0:00:00.000,0:00:11.440
Let me first honour the great men of God and servants of God here today.

0:00:11.440,0:00:23.440
I thank God for their lives and for giving their lives to be used.

0:00:23.440,0:00:34.180
I also want to honour all the professionals.

0:00:34.180,0:00:46.200
We know that everything big starts little.

0:00:46.200,0:00:48.640
Hallelujah.

0:00:48.640,0:00:51.920
Thank you.

0:00:51.920,0:00:57.180
South Korea Crusade

0:00:57.180,0:01:04.000
I want you to pray for me; just stretch your hand and pray for me.

0:01:04.000,0:01:08.480
I need your prayer.

0:01:08.480,0:01:14.620
South Korea Crusade

0:01:14.620,0:01:15.560
Thank you.

0:01:15.560,0:01:17.500
Amen.

0:01:17.500,0:01:23.100
South Korea Crusade

0:01:23.100,0:01:25.880
Thank you.

0:01:25.880,0:01:26.780
Hallelujah.

0:01:26.780,0:01:29.520
In Jesus' name.

0:01:29.520,0:01:33.920
Yes, I'm strong!

0:01:33.920,0:01:38.620
Thank you.

0:01:38.620,0:01:57.680
Whatever situations you are going through..they are the soil on which faith grows.

0:01:57.680,0:02:03.700
I don’t know what you are going through.

0:02:03.700,0:02:13.100
Has your faith been tested now

0:02:13.100,0:02:20.980
or have you been tested in the past?

0:02:20.980,0:02:29.640
Cool down and relax.

0:02:29.640,0:02:36.440
South Korea Crusade

0:02:36.440,0:02:46.580
The answer to your test is in the Word of God.

0:02:46.580,0:02:52.440
Here is the Word of God – the Bible.

0:02:52.440,0:03:01.620
The answer to your test is in the Word of God.

0:03:01.620,0:03:17.160
The Bible is the food for your soul – your spiritual weapon.

0:03:17.160,0:03:20.320
It has healing power.

0:03:20.320,0:03:26.500
South Korea Crusade

0:03:26.520,0:03:33.800
It has a purifying power.

0:03:33.800,0:03:39.600
It is enduring.

0:03:39.600,0:03:45.540
It rejoices the heart.

0:03:45.540,0:03:56.680
It keeps us from error and sin.

0:03:56.680,0:04:02.160
It is profitable.

0:04:02.160,0:04:08.360
This is the Bible.

0:04:08.360,0:04:24.140
This will lead us to our title today
"Situation strengthen one's faith".

0:04:24.140,0:04:29.040
The situation I went through today -

0:04:29.040,0:04:33.780
we missed our way when we were coming.

0:04:33.780,0:04:37.780
We were looking for the road.

0:04:37.780,0:04:41.140
That strengthened my faith the more.

0:04:41.140,0:04:45.940
South Korea Crusade

0:04:45.940,0:04:54.540
Situations strengthen one's faith.

0:04:54.540,0:05:06.220
Whatever you do now that is not in line with God's agenda,

0:05:06.220,0:05:11.980
that seems to prosper,

0:05:11.980,0:05:27.100
will probably disappoint you in your greatest time of need.

0:05:27.100,0:05:35.480
What I am doing is God's agenda for me;

0:05:35.480,0:05:47.480
that is why we could reach here and at the same time, my faith strengthened.

0:05:47.480,0:05:51.220
Because what you are doing is God's agenda for you,

0:05:51.220,0:06:05.860
that is why your situation has not destroyed you before coming here.

0:06:05.860,0:06:15.800
The ups and downs we see in the world today

0:06:15.800,0:06:29.400
are practical examples of not following up on God's agenda.

0:06:29.400,0:06:40.420
You are worried and upset about many things.

0:06:40.420,0:06:56.200
Your business is not doing well, your family is not doing well; in your health, there are challenges.

0:06:56.200,0:07:07.260
Let me take you to the book of John, chapter 16.

0:07:07.260,0:07:12.980
Let me just read the last verse there.

0:07:12.980,0:07:22.280
"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.

0:07:22.280,0:07:27.880
In this world you will have tribulation. But take heart! I have overcome the world."

0:07:27.880,0:07:47.280
South Korea Crusade

0:07:47.280,0:08:03.180
That you are on God's agenda, you depend on God – total dependence upon God,

0:08:03.180,0:08:09.460
does not mean you will not be touched.

0:08:09.460,0:08:15.080
South Korea Crusade

0:08:15.080,0:08:35.920
Sickness will test you, hardship will test you, tribulation will test you but they cannot destroy you.

0:08:35.920,0:08:40.960
They cannot destroy you.

0:08:40.960,0:08:57.960
According to John 16:33, 'In this world, there will be tribulation. Cheer up'.

0:08:57.960,0:09:09.700
'Cheer up' means to have confidence, hope.

0:09:09.700,0:09:16.040
'Cheer up, I have overcome the world.'

0:09:16.040,0:09:31.740
This means tribulation, sickness, disease, whatever you call it, will test you

0:09:31.740,0:09:38.980
but cannot destroy you.

0:09:38.980,0:09:50.380
Whatever brought you here today...

0:09:50.380,0:10:00.500
I'm right by saying "whatever brought you here", whatever brought us here, including me...

0:10:00.500,0:10:07.960
Because everyone has limitation.

0:10:07.960,0:10:16.380
You are because I am; I am because you are.

0:10:16.380,0:10:27.460
That is, there is something I cannot do that you do for me – you translate for me.

0:10:27.460,0:10:34.760
I cannot stand here, talking and translating for myself.

0:10:34.760,0:10:38.520
That is my weakness.

0:10:38.520,0:10:44.140
You are sitting down, listening to me.

0:10:44.140,0:10:51.240
As I am talking to you, I cannot sit down at the same time.

0:10:51.240,0:10:55.680
You too cannot stand here, talking.

0:10:55.680,0:11:09.780
My weakness is – I cannot stand here and at the same time sit down. That is my weakness.

0:11:09.780,0:11:15.100
Everyone has limitation.

0:11:15.100,0:11:22.080
This is why I say, "Whatever brought you here today".

0:11:22.080,0:11:26.760
Whatever brought us here today.

0:11:26.760,0:11:34.640
I came here because I want to talk to someone.

0:11:34.640,0:11:40.600
I want to talk to someone in Korea.

0:11:40.600,0:11:45.480
Yes – that is what brought me here.

0:11:45.480,0:12:06.440
Whatever brought you here is only a weapon God uses to preserve you.

0:12:06.440,0:12:18.520
If I was not here today, who knows what would have happened to me in Nigeria?

0:12:18.520,0:12:25.160
So, I am here to be preserved.

0:12:25.160,0:12:37.380
Your sickness is meant to preserve you, to reform you.

0:12:37.380,0:12:52.620
It may equally be to keep you for a new level in life.

0:12:52.620,0:13:09.620
As a Christian, whatever level we find ourselves, we always believe the best is yet to come.

0:13:09.620,0:13:19.980
Situations strengthen our faith.

0:13:19.980,0:13:28.480
As a Christian, don’t despair at all.

0:13:28.480,0:13:33.780
Unfavourable circumstances,

0:13:33.780,0:13:47.500
I mean, unfavourable situations are the arguments satan uses

0:13:47.500,0:14:04.200
to make people of God question their sonship.

0:14:04.200,0:14:09.740
Thank you, I'm happy. I discover you.

0:14:09.740,0:14:12.420
I want to join you now.

0:14:12.420,0:14:22.060
Unfavourable circumstances are the arguments satan uses

0:14:22.060,0:14:31.220
to make people of God question their sonship.

0:14:31.220,0:14:48.800
The devil wants us to curse God while under pain, trouble, temptation,

0:14:48.800,0:15:02.040
to look at God in a bad light.

0:15:02.040,0:15:13.600
Those who bless God in trouble, tribulation, prove their sonship.

0:15:13.600,0:15:19.380
South Korea  Crusade

0:15:19.380,0:15:26.100
Oh my God, I need to take my water too.

0:15:26.100,0:15:32.180
Excuse me.

0:15:32.180,0:15:36.100
Thank you.

0:15:36.100,0:15:51.040
Those who bless God in trouble, tribulation, prove their sonship.

0:15:51.040,0:15:57.280
Prove their sonship.

0:15:57.280,0:16:07.840
Don’t allow your situation to rule you.

0:16:07.840,0:16:19.140
The rich must not concentrate on their wealth

0:16:19.140,0:16:37.280
because a man can be poor and yet be a friend of God, a candidate of Heaven.

0:16:37.280,0:16:42.940
Stop thinking about your situation; don’t allow your situation to rule you

0:16:42.940,0:17:00.140
because a man can be sick in body and yet, be a friend of Jesus.

0:17:00.140,0:17:12.720
You see people lamenting, complaining, whining

0:17:12.720,0:17:24.720
and questioning their faith in the presence of others because of their situation

0:17:24.720,0:17:33.680
instead of honouring God with their problems before men.

0:17:33.700,0:17:38.400
Honouring God.

0:17:38.400,0:17:42.620
Thank You, Jesus.

0:17:42.620,0:17:43.940
That is a Christian.

0:17:43.940,0:17:46.300
But others...

0:17:46.300,0:17:58.000
Oh...oh....oh...oh...oh!

0:17:58.000,0:18:01.960
OK, you teach me this language.

0:18:01.960,0:18:12.240
Instead of honouring God with their situation before men

0:18:12.240,0:18:18.500
as Daniel did…

0:18:18.520,0:18:22.300
Ask Daniel.

0:18:22.300,0:18:29.140
Let me take you to the lion's den and ask Daniel.

0:18:29.140,0:18:41.080
Ask Daniel and he would tell you what happened in the lion's den.

0:18:41.080,0:18:48.780
Ask Paul and Silas and they would tell you what happened in the prison.

0:18:48.780,0:19:04.280
They were singing and their hands and legs were chained.

0:19:04.280,0:19:07.000
Thank you.

0:19:07.000,0:19:11.360
They were singing, creating a wonderful atmosphere

0:19:11.360,0:19:23.820
while their legs and hands were chained

0:19:23.820,0:19:37.600
because they knew there was something better beyond their situation.

0:19:37.600,0:19:45.140
Even if God allows it as a trial,

0:19:45.140,0:19:53.160
that is, if God allows your situation as a trial,

0:19:53.160,0:20:05.440
we must not think it strange and doubt our Guide.

0:20:05.440,0:20:08.900
Because of your situation,

0:20:08.900,0:20:16.580
don't cut off your dependence on God,

0:20:16.580,0:20:21.480
your duty to God,

0:20:21.480,0:20:28.420
your communion with God.

0:20:28.420,0:20:31.020
Yes.

0:20:31.020,0:20:36.760
We are here with different situations.

0:20:36.760,0:20:46.180
You are saying because of that sickness, you are not a child of God. No!

0:20:46.180,0:20:56.760
Because you are poor, you say you are not a child of God; your prayer is not answered. No!

0:20:56.760,0:21:01.540
These are the things satan uses

0:21:01.540,0:21:08.340
to take you out of your position.

0:21:08.340,0:21:13.060
Your enemies think they are hurting you

0:21:13.060,0:21:20.540
not knowing that their hatred, evil plans, envy and jealousy

0:21:20.540,0:21:29.540
are weapons God uses to preserve you.

0:21:29.540,0:21:40.340
South Korea Crusade

0:21:40.340,0:21:53.000
There is one person who can get you out of God's will;

0:21:53.000,0:21:57.000
that is yourself.

0:21:57.000,0:22:02.440
Sickness cannot get you out of God's will.

0:22:02.440,0:22:12.320
Your enemy, satan, demon cannot get you out of God's will.

0:22:12.320,0:22:20.380
There is one person who can get you out of God's will;

0:22:20.380,0:22:26.220
that is yourself.

0:22:26.220,0:22:42.560
Let me take you to the book of Luke 22:32.

0:22:42.560,0:22:55.980
Here we end our message for today, and we can move around to attend to the sick.

0:22:55.980,0:22:59.340
We believe God will give us the grace to continue.

0:22:59.340,0:23:06.920
I should not talk as if I knew that we would continue.

0:23:06.920,0:23:09.640
Oh yes.

0:23:09.640,0:23:16.040
Let's go to the book of Luke 22:32.

0:23:16.040,0:23:31.160
"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail."

0:23:31.160,0:23:52.900
What is good for Simon in the Bible is equally good for all.

0:23:52.900,0:24:01.720
He says, "I pray you, Simon, that your faith will not fail".

0:24:01.720,0:24:13.760
This means there is something that will challenge our faith -

0:24:13.760,0:24:18.920
something that will test our faith.

0:24:18.920,0:24:22.580
This is what we are going through now.

0:24:22.580,0:24:43.680
This is a prophetic word that a time like this – a time for sickness, affliction, poverty to test…

0:24:43.680,0:24:53.340
So, why are we lamenting when sickness comes to test?

0:24:53.340,0:24:58.100
Why are we murmuring

0:24:58.100,0:25:03.480
when hardship comes, as a Christian, to test,

0:25:03.480,0:25:20.160
when the Bible says, I pray your faith will not fail?

0:25:20.160,0:25:29.580
He never promised to keep us away from trouble.

0:25:29.580,0:25:36.520
He never promised to keep us away from tribulation.

0:25:36.520,0:25:44.900
What you are going through, He never promised to keep you away from it.

0:25:44.900,0:25:49.640
He never promised to keep us away from all these – hardship, trouble

0:25:49.640,0:26:00.400
but He promised to see us through, if you are with Him.

0:26:00.400,0:26:09.320
South Korea Crusade

0:26:09.320,0:26:12.720
I'm hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit.

0:26:12.720,0:26:14.840
He says I should go and attend to the sick ones.

0:26:14.840,0:26:16.440
Thank you.

0:26:16.440,0:26:31.580

0:26:31.580,0:26:42.700
I think I need to "chip in" a word before we go for healing.

0:26:42.700,0:26:48.920
Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings

0:26:48.920,0:26:58.640
are hindered by the way and manner we go about the issue of money.

0:26:58.640,0:27:10.120
South Korea Crusade

0:27:10.120,0:27:14.200
I repeat.

0:27:14.200,0:27:22.760
Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings

0:27:22.760,0:27:28.040
are hindered today

0:27:28.040,0:27:40.360
by the way and manner we go about the issue of money, money, money.

0:27:40.360,0:27:46.620
South Korea Crusade

0:27:46.620,0:28:13.660
No one can give money from his heart before healing.

0:28:13.660,0:28:22.260
Anybody that gives money before healing is giving that money on a condition -

0:28:22.260,0:28:35.200
heal me, have money.

0:28:35.200,0:28:47.720
Healing and God's blessings should not be exchanged with money.

0:28:47.720,0:28:52.120
When we give freely

0:28:52.120,0:28:56.300
as we have been given freely,

0:28:56.300,0:29:05.500
God will raise His people to bless us abundantly.

0:29:05.500,0:29:14.860
Anything that does not come from the heart is a sin.

0:29:14.860,0:29:21.320
If someone gives money before healing, he is not giving it from his heart;

0:29:21.320,0:29:26.760
he is giving it to receive healing.

0:29:26.760,0:29:33.960
South Korea Crusade

0:29:33.980,0:29:42.420
Anything that is not from the heart is a sin.

0:29:42.420,0:29:53.220
This is why it's so difficult to receive healing and deliverance today.

0:29:53.220,0:30:12.460
All this - God's blessings, are hindered by the manner and way we go about money.

0:30:12.460,0:30:21.600
Thank you.
