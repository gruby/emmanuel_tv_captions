My name is Hugh Mtshali. I am from South Africa.

0:00:04.300,0:00:11.700
I am the CEO and a businessman and by profession I am an analitical chemist.

0:00:11.700,0:00:17.380
And next to me is my business partner.

0:00:17.380,0:00:24.160
One of my businesses is in the manufacturing of healthcare products.

0:00:24.160,0:00:35.520
It's one of the most important products in South Africa, where we supply the government of South Africa.

0:00:35.520,0:00:40.620
The business has been around for more than twenty years.

0:00:40.620,0:00:48.880
At some stage, about ten years ago we started experiencing some issues in the business.

0:00:48.880,0:00:55.860
The business had financial challenges, we then had some attacks.

0:00:55.860,0:01:01.000
Through those attacks, we thought: "What is going wrong?"

0:01:01.000,0:01:12.820
We called upon other third party agencies to come over and test our product to see if anything was wrong.

0:01:12.820,0:01:15.160
or if there was anything we could improve.

0:01:15.160,0:01:19.660
But then we found out that there was nothing wrong with our product.

0:01:19.660,0:01:28.280
I tried to speak to some influential people to see what kind of intervention they could bring

0:01:28.280,0:01:31.660
in this whole challenge that we were facing.

0:01:31.660,0:01:36.140
Our business appointed more than two hundred people

0:01:36.140,0:01:41.120
and most of them were black women, unemployed people.

0:01:41.120,0:01:49.980
So we thought: "Let's take them from poverty and unemployment and give decent jobs."

0:01:49.980,0:01:57.560
But then, when we started getting those challenges because we weren't able to sell the product

0:01:57.560,0:02:04.080
because it could not be approved, to be tested.

0:02:04.080,0:02:11.500
We went to get some funding debt from a bank in South Africa.

0:02:11.500,0:02:17.960
And then, at some stage, this attack led us to the fact that we couldn't service the debt.

0:02:17.960,0:02:24.780
So then we started getting into problems and it just went on and on.

0:02:24.780,0:02:27.200
And it really affected me, big time.

0:02:27.200,0:02:33.600
At some stage, we were coming from a place in Pumalanga

0:02:33.600,0:02:39.700
and I found out that my blood pressure was very high.

0:02:39.700,0:02:46.020
So that was the stress that the business had on me, personally.

0:02:46.020,0:02:58.960
So I was hospitalized for about a week and my BP was at about 220, that could cause a stroke.

0:02:58.980,0:03:08.280
After we received help from the bank, we were unable to service the debt.

0:03:08.280,0:03:16.580
We tried everything. We tried everything humanly possible.

0:03:16.580,0:03:31.560
My colleague kept on telling me about Emmanuel TV: "Try Emmanuel TV, pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua."

0:03:31.560,0:03:35.000
And then I said: "Ok, I will give it a try at some time."

0:03:35.000,0:03:41.260
And then the bank sent us these papers, letters of demand,

0:03:41.260,0:03:46.220
meaning that they wanted their money, otherwise we were going to get into trouble.

0:03:46.220,0:03:50.140
It stressed my wife, Naomi, big time.

0:03:50.140,0:03:56.640
And then we were about to undertake this trip to New York where my daughter was studying.

0:03:56.640,0:04:00.360
At some stage she wanted to cancel the trip saying,

0:04:00.360,0:04:04.200
"How are we going to travel whilst we are in pain".

0:04:04.200,0:04:10.440
She was like, "We don't want our houses, our properties to be repossessed".

0:04:10.440,0:04:15.100
So I said, "Ok, we'll make a plan".

0:04:15.100,0:04:19.940
Then I took up the advice from my business partner

0:04:19.940,0:04:28.460
and said: "We'll just pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua, when he prompts you to touch the screen."

0:04:28.460,0:04:36.940
So what I did was that I took those papers from the bank and as he was prompting us to pray along,

0:04:36.940,0:04:39.940
I took those papers and put them onto the screen.

0:04:39.940,0:04:46.540
And the debt was millions and millions of Rand, big millions.

0:04:46.540,0:04:50.380
So I put those papers on the screen.

0:04:50.380,0:04:51.820
The papers from the bank?

0:04:51.820,0:04:56.160
From the bank. Those are letters of demand and this was no game.

0:04:56.160,0:04:58.440
I put them along and I prayed along.

0:04:58.440,0:05:07.900
As I put my papers on the screen, I felt some energy.

0:05:07.900,0:05:09.700
You felt...?

0:05:09.700,0:05:16.580
Energy. I will put it in the human language: "Zzz!" Alright?

0:05:16.580,0:05:23.500
So that was obviously the power of God. It happened, I put the papers away.

0:05:23.500,0:05:28.400
My wife kept on saying, "Why are we going?"

0:05:28.400,0:05:39.460
We left and I would say to her, "You know, things will be alright. Don't be afraid".

0:05:39.460,0:05:52.240
And nine days later, while we were overseas, I saw this email letter from the bank.

0:05:52.240,0:05:58.440
I read it once, twice, thrice.

0:05:58.440,0:06:02.220
It kept on saying the same thing, "The debt has been cancelled".

0:06:02.220,0:06:03.580
I said: "No, it can't be."

0:06:03.580,0:06:09.700
Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!

0:06:09.700,0:06:15.600
After that, because I wouldn't show my wife something I wasn't sure about

0:06:15.600,0:06:18.920
because then I would get a smack.

0:06:18.920,0:06:24.980
I then was strong enough in my resolve to show it to my wife.

0:06:24.980,0:06:28.600
I didn't even want to talk or say anything.

0:06:28.600,0:06:33.860
I just showed her the letter. She read it. She cried.

0:06:33.860,0:06:40.080
She said, "Is it real?" I said, "Well, that's what it says".

0:06:40.080,0:06:47.780
So she read it again. I then thought: "Ok, let me phone our business partners back in South Africa

0:06:47.780,0:06:52.720
to say, "Are we on the same page?  Are you reading what I'm reading?""

0:06:52.720,0:06:57.420
Then they said, "Hugh, we've been looking for you because of this".

0:06:57.420,0:07:02.000
Basically, what that letter said was: "The debt has been cancelled.

0:07:02.000,0:07:08.320
You have one day to sign to agree, whether you want your debt to be cancelled or not."

0:07:08.320,0:07:18.400
Number one. Number two, it said: "You have been selected to qualify for a certain program."

0:07:18.400,0:07:21.720
Which I never applied for.

0:07:21.720,0:07:23.180
So...

0:07:23.180,0:07:29.080
Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:07:29.080,0:07:34.440
So, I was hit with two miracles at the same time.

0:07:34.440,0:07:41.320
Of course, I signed it off immediately and I sent it back to South Africa.

0:07:41.320,0:07:46.500
We checked if that letter was authentic and yes, it was authentic.

0:07:46.500,0:07:50.980
We spoke to the bank, the bank said, "We've been waiting for your signature".

0:07:50.980,0:07:57.120
So I thought it was highly imperative for me -

0:07:57.120,0:08:05.000
this is my first time here at The SCOAN to share this wonderful testimony.

0:08:05.000,0:08:13.000
I wouldn't have hidden it because you don't hide things from God. It would be a travesty.

0:08:13.000,0:08:22.100
I won those blessings from God.  So, I tested Him and He intervened at the right time.

0:08:22.100,0:08:29.140
So, it shows that God's timing was perfect because during that trip it was traumatic.

0:08:29.140,0:08:39.480
I kept a brave face to my wife to say, "It's going to be fine", although, I felt worried.

0:08:39.480,0:08:46.040
But I had that belief to give God a chance.

0:08:46.040,0:08:55.780
So the debt is zero. I'm here to give this testimony to the wonderful people.

0:08:55.780,0:09:00.600
Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:09:00.600,0:09:05.000
Give God a chance at all times. Trust in Him.

0:09:05.000,0:09:13.020
He is the biggest intervention, strategy, plan - whatever you may call it.

0:09:13.020,0:09:21.380
Whether you are a CEO, a chairman, whether you are experienced in business for hundred years,

0:09:21.380,0:09:27.960
whatever you are - trust in the living God, give Him a chance and He will come through for you.

0:09:27.960,0:09:32.120
Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.

0:09:32.120,0:09:38.540
Yes, indeed, it is obvious that after our brother had exhausted all his emotional and mental resources,

0:09:38.540,0:09:44.680
he definitely had to trust in Someone who is smarter, stronger and wiser which is our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

0:09:44.680,0:09:49.640
And today we can see the evidence of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who had indeed transformed

0:09:49.640,0:09:52.400
not only your life and your business at large.

0:09:52.400,0:09:54.940
We thank God for your life and we just want to tell you

0:09:54.940,0:09:59.680
that now that God Almighty has done this wonderful thing for you, continue to honour Him,

0:09:59.680,0:10:02.140
follow Him and receive instruction from Him

0:10:02.140,0:10:06.020
and we pray that God Almighty will give you grace to be a good leader

0:10:06.020,0:10:07.280
in Jesus' Name.

0:10:07.280,0:10:10.000
Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
