0:00:04.100,0:00:06.360
Thank you.

0:00:06.360,0:00:08.220
Good morning, Church.

0:00:08.220,0:00:11.020
(Good morning.)

0:00:11.020,0:00:16.760
Viewers, good morning to you all.

0:00:16.760,0:00:19.500
Thank you, you may be seated.

0:00:19.500,0:00:22.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:22.780,0:00:30.740
I see the need of coming out to wish you Merry Christmas in advance.

0:00:30.740,0:00:38.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:38.020,0:00:44.840
The year is coming to an end.

0:00:44.840,0:00:55.240
The sooner the better - we begin to remind ourselves what we need to do, preparing for the new year.

0:00:55.240,0:01:00.240
Once again - Happy New Year in advance.

0:01:00.240,0:01:09.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:09.080,0:01:21.460
Let's quickly go to our Holy Bible and see one of the messages the Lord prepared for us for the coming year.

0:01:21.460,0:01:23.000
(Amen.)

0:01:23.000,0:01:27.680
Take your reading: 1 Corinthians 13.

0:01:27.680,0:01:32.420
Thank you - let's take our reading about love here.

0:01:32.420,0:01:43.580
1 Corinthians 12:31: "Love is Indispensable
...And yet I will show you the most excellent way."

0:01:43.580,0:01:51.080
The most excellent way to enjoy your life.

0:01:51.080,0:01:56.260
THE BEAUTY OF LIFE

0:01:56.260,0:02:06.080
If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love,

0:02:06.080,0:02:10.080
I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

0:02:10.080,0:02:18.000
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,

0:02:18.000,0:02:27.040
and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.

0:02:27.040,0:02:39.280
If I give all I possess to the poor and give my body to hardship...

0:02:39.280,0:02:48.020
Many of us fast and pray in hardship - you say, "In the name of Jesus" - listen what the Bible says here:

0:02:48.020,0:02:55.080
... that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.

0:02:55.080,0:03:05.860
We fast, we pray but it seems that nothing comes.

0:03:05.860,0:03:21.920
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast - that is love.

0:03:21.920,0:03:28.560
It is not proud, arrogant.

0:03:28.560,0:03:36.600
It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking - that is love.

0:03:36.600,0:03:46.380
It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

0:03:46.380,0:03:48.220
Past is past.

0:03:48.220,0:03:56.700
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

0:03:56.700,0:04:01.700
It puts everything behind - that is love.

0:04:01.700,0:04:05.000
‘Let love lead’, that is our motto.

0:04:05.000,0:04:08.840
I know many of you have the sticker.
You have it, don't you?

0:04:08.840,0:04:10.920
Let love lead.

0:04:10.920,0:04:15.300
Let's quickly have a look at 1 Corinthians 13:13:

0:04:15.300,0:04:24.440
"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

0:04:24.440,0:04:26.940
Let someone say, "Let love lead".

0:04:26.940,0:04:29.000
(Let love lead.)

0:04:29.000,0:04:30.240
Yes.

0:04:30.240,0:04:45.200
If love is the greatest, you should let it lead you everywhere, day by day – love.

0:04:45.200,0:05:02.320
Most of us here, we always wait until people are crying for help before we can help.

0:05:02.320,0:05:09.900
What the Bible was saying about our attitude towards love, the way and manner we show love?

0:05:09.900,0:05:15.040
People crying for help before you can help.

0:05:15.040,0:05:22.440
We remain indifferent until people say, “Please, help me!”

0:05:22.440,0:05:28.000
We see them lamenting and crying before we say, “Come”.

0:05:28.000,0:05:29.920
That is not love.

0:05:29.920,0:05:33.580
Such love cannot attract God’s attention.

0:05:33.580,0:05:37.840
"Uncle, please help me..."

0:05:37.840,0:05:45.560
Where were you looking, before someone came asking, "Help me, uncle"?

0:05:45.560,0:05:50.440
You must have seen him in one way or another.

0:05:50.440,0:05:58.740
That is not love that attracts God's attention.

0:05:58.740,0:06:11.280
What we give or what we do is not as important as the manner and way in which we do it.

0:06:11.280,0:06:21.040
What you give me is not as important as the manner and way you give me.

0:06:21.040,0:06:25.200
The manner and way you give me attracts God’s attention.

0:06:25.200,0:06:28.920
It is not what you give that attracts God’s attention.

0:06:28.920,0:06:34.580
It is not the millions you are giving; it is not all your possessions you give

0:06:34.580,0:06:44.940
but the manner and way you give them that attracts God’s attention.

0:06:44.940,0:07:01.940
When you give to someone in a way that pleases God, someone is waiting to give you too.

0:07:01.940,0:07:12.060
When you give to someone in a way that pleases God, someone will be waiting also to give you too.

0:07:12.060,0:07:16.400
You have been giving all this...

0:07:16.400,0:07:25.920
If you do not give in a way and manner that pleases God, you are just wasting your effort and time.

0:07:25.920,0:07:31.900
It is not what we give that matters but the manner and way we give them.

0:07:31.900,0:07:34.860
Look at you: you are sitting in the church today.

0:07:34.860,0:07:43.000
If there was an issue of big importance to address, who knows if you would be here.

0:07:43.000,0:07:50.880
The way you do things attracts God’s attention; it is not what you do.

0:07:50.880,0:07:58.980
Who knows – if you received a phone call now:
“Hello” – oh this is my excellency, my president,

0:07:58.980,0:08:08.200
this is a million dollar opportunity - who knows if you wouldn't escape the church?

0:08:08.200,0:08:17.260
The manner and the way we do things and give things matters.

0:08:17.260,0:08:21.900
God is not one of those things – He is the only thing.

0:08:21.900,0:08:30.740
The beauty of life does not depend on how happy you are

0:08:30.740,0:08:37.800
but on how happy others can be because of you.

0:08:37.800,0:08:45.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:45.680,0:08:54.700
How many people are happy because of you today?

0:08:54.700,0:08:59.740
How many lives have you touched?

0:08:59.740,0:09:04.180
Somebody needs something you possess.

0:09:04.180,0:09:11.580
It may be your love, smile – a genuine one,

0:09:11.580,0:09:20.600
it may be your money, strength, time.

0:09:20.600,0:09:25.980
You talk of salvation?
Look at the whole world.

0:09:25.980,0:09:40.460
80% of the world is crying - hardship in your place, poverty, orphans which were supposed to go to school -

0:09:40.460,0:09:46.500
and you are telling me that you are saved.

0:09:46.500,0:09:52.140
Someone is in need of you.

0:09:52.140,0:10:01.500
No matter how little you have.

0:10:01.500,0:10:08.280
You say you are saved, born again - but see the people on the streets, at your place.

0:10:08.280,0:10:19.040
Your children are in the school, but the children of your neighbor are on the street and you turn your head away.

0:10:19.040,0:10:24.280
And you say you are saved - salvation.

0:10:24.280,0:10:29.640
How do we define salvation?

0:10:29.640,0:10:42.180
You may say you are poor; you may be surprised to see someone who is poorer than you are.

0:10:42.180,0:10:52.660
In life, there are always greater and lesser people than you.

0:10:52.660,0:11:11.460
Let us see the help of the widow, needy, poor, refugee as a priority over any other help.

0:11:11.460,0:11:14.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:14.580,0:11:21.180
When you help them, you sow to the Spirit.

0:11:21.180,0:11:23.980
You are a spirit being.

0:11:23.980,0:11:35.520
The real thing about you is not your body.

0:11:35.520,0:11:49.260
In John 8:36, Jesus said, ‘If the Son sets you free, you are free indeed’.

0:11:49.260,0:11:53.640
He meant the liberation of the spirit man.

0:11:53.640,0:11:57.360
He meant the liberation of what?

0:11:57.360,0:12:02.060
Spirit man.

0:12:02.060,0:12:04.700
A man is a spirit being.

0:12:04.700,0:12:07.080
Tell your neighbour, ‘You are a spirit being’.

0:12:07.080,0:12:08.220
(You are a spirit being.)

0:12:08.220,0:12:09.180
I can't hear you.

0:12:09.180,0:12:10.700
(You are a spirit being.)

0:12:10.700,0:12:11.800
I can't hear you.

0:12:11.800,0:12:13.060
(You are a spirit being.)

0:12:13.060,0:12:14.140
I can't hear you.

0:12:14.140,0:12:15.480
(You are a spirit being.)

0:12:15.480,0:12:17.620
Yes.

0:12:17.620,0:12:19.700
Let's sow to the Spirit.

0:12:19.700,0:12:24.940
For those of us who are saying, ‘I am poor. I have little’,

0:12:24.940,0:12:33.380
if you cannot part with little, you will not be able to part with much.

0:12:33.380,0:12:41.460
Our idea of "if only" keeps robbing us of our blessings.

0:12:41.460,0:12:54.740
If only I had money I would help the poor, 
if only I had enough money I would build an orphanage.

0:12:54.740,0:12:58.940
The danger here is:

0:12:58.940,0:13:13.960
if you fail to help with the little God has blessed you with, more may never come.

0:13:13.960,0:13:32.080
The danger here is, if you fail to bless, help people with the little God blessed you with,

0:13:32.080,0:13:35.760
more may never come.

0:13:35.760,0:13:39.780
That is the measure.

0:13:39.780,0:13:48.400
The way and manner you manage little possessions or money,

0:13:48.400,0:13:57.800
will make God decide whether to promote you or not.

0:13:57.800,0:14:02.140
How do you manage your little possessions?

0:14:02.140,0:14:07.700
Everyone claims to have little.

0:14:07.700,0:14:11.800
THE BEAUTY OF LIFE

0:14:11.800,0:14:19.460
Don’t forget, your possessions alone cannot give you contentment -

0:14:19.460,0:14:27.300
that is why we are running helter-skelter -

0:14:27.300,0:14:35.680
but giving help to the needy, to the poor can.

0:14:35.680,0:14:40.780
Happy New Year in advance.

0:14:40.780,0:14:48.940
This is the way, the road to the New Year.

0:14:48.940,0:14:55.760
Ask Zacchaeus in Luke 19:9

0:14:55.760,0:15:05.120
and he would tell you that when he decided to give cheerfully and genuinely to the poor,

0:15:05.120,0:15:19.200
Jesus recommended him and said to him that salvation had come to his household.

0:15:19.200,0:15:29.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:29.100,0:15:34.300
The word salvation means contentment.

0:15:34.300,0:15:38.860
Are you content?

0:15:38.860,0:15:41.840
Salvation means what?

0:15:41.840,0:15:44.380
Are you content?

0:15:44.380,0:15:47.760
It means you are not saved.

0:15:47.760,0:15:53.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:53.640,0:16:03.680
I define again: salvation means contentment - to be content.

0:16:03.680,0:16:06.160
What others are doing -

0:16:06.160,0:16:12.500
I am what God says I am, I have what God says I have and I can do what God says I can do.

0:16:12.500,0:16:19.320
That is the meaning of contentment.

0:16:19.320,0:16:23.240
Are you content?

0:16:23.240,0:16:28.520
You always measure, compare yourself to others.

0:16:28.520,0:16:30.720
That is not contentment.

0:16:30.720,0:16:33.860
Envy, jealousy...

0:16:33.860,0:16:37.200
A road to the new year.

0:16:37.200,0:16:41.980
I want to take you back again in summary.

0:16:41.980,0:16:57.060
Love is the greatest weapon – let love lead.

0:16:57.060,0:17:14.140
What you are giving is not as important as the way and manner in which you give them.

0:17:14.140,0:17:24.680
Tell me - when you have given something to a neighbour and said, "Thank you for receiving my gift"...

0:17:24.680,0:17:30.100
When somebody receives your gift, it is reshaping your destiny.

0:17:30.100,0:17:31.480
It's helping you.

0:17:31.480,0:17:39.260
You are not helping the person you give but the person that receives your gift is helping you.

0:17:39.260,0:17:44.760
Today, you believe the person you are giving is the one you are helping and he should thank you.

0:17:44.760,0:17:49.220
Rather, you should thank him for receiving your gift.

0:17:49.220,0:17:53.340
When you give, you are reshaping your destiny.

0:17:53.340,0:17:58.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:58.020,0:18:16.060
With all your heart, give what is pure, what is good, what is just, what is admirable.

0:18:16.060,0:18:21.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:21.500,0:18:27.080
This is why your millions don't give you peace.

0:18:27.080,0:18:32.260
You are supposed to realise peace and comfort but yet, no peace, no comfort

0:18:32.260,0:18:41.540
upon your possessions and money because you have not been giving

0:18:41.540,0:18:59.860
to the poor, needy, refugees, widows and orphans in a manner and way that pleases God.

0:18:59.860,0:19:12.440
When you give with all your heart, someone is waiting to give to you.

0:19:12.440,0:19:16.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:16.200,0:19:23.800
If I remind you about tithes, offerings - I am not supposed to say it.

0:19:23.800,0:19:31.980
If I say and you give me, it will not bless me, because you are not giving this from your heart.

0:19:31.980,0:19:35.460
It is not something they should inform or remind me about.

0:19:35.460,0:19:38.300
It should come from your heart.

0:19:38.300,0:19:40.680
There is no forcing in it.

0:19:40.680,0:19:42.160
It is a blessing.

0:19:42.160,0:19:50.240
We don’t force people to bless; blessing comes naturally.

0:19:50.240,0:19:53.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:53.960,0:20:04.940
If you are not giving to the needy with all your heart, you are just wasting your time.

0:20:04.940,0:20:09.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:09.460,0:20:11.260
Yes.

0:20:11.260,0:20:17.140
Let the Spirit convince you.

0:20:17.140,0:20:25.700
Happy New Year in advance.

0:20:25.700,0:20:35.680
If you have two shirts, give one to the poor.

0:20:35.680,0:20:48.320
If you have food, share with those who are hungry.

0:20:48.320,0:20:54.000
Go into your wardrobe, go into your cupboard, go into your store

0:20:54.000,0:20:58.600
and see the need to give to the needy and the poor.

0:20:58.600,0:21:00.480
Your life will not remain the same.

0:21:00.480,0:21:02.040
(Amen.)

0:21:02.040,0:21:08.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:08.220,0:21:16.740
I want to see you going to the bank, withdrawing the money and giving it to the poor.

0:21:16.740,0:21:22.960
THE BEAUTY OF LIFE

0:21:22.960,0:21:28.760
Don't wait for the reward after giving.

0:21:28.760,0:21:31.860
It is better they don't know you.

0:21:31.860,0:21:41.280
If they know you, don’t pose yourself as a giver. Jesus is the Giver.

0:21:41.280,0:21:42.740
(Amen.)

0:21:42.740,0:21:51.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:51.380,0:21:55.560

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:59.900,0:22:10.360
Your labour of love without cheerful and sincere giving cannot help you.

0:22:10.360,0:22:20.340
Let us be sincere to ourselves; stop giving only what you do not need.

0:22:20.340,0:22:24.560
Give also what you need.

0:22:24.560,0:22:30.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:30.900,0:22:36.880
If God had been giving you what you do not need, would you be blessed?

0:22:36.880,0:22:40.040
You give what you do not need.

0:22:40.040,0:22:47.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:47.640,0:22:51.340
Tell your neighbour, "Stop giving only what you do not need".

(Stop giving only what you do not need.)

0:22:53.980,0:22:57.440
Giving is a sacrifice.

0:22:57.440,0:23:00.340
If you give what you do not need, that is not sacrifice.

0:23:00.340,0:23:03.460
Sacrifice means pain in one way or the other.

0:23:03.460,0:23:10.740
You feel it, you must feel it...

0:23:10.740,0:23:13.940
Look at the time you come here.

0:23:13.940,0:23:17.360
It seems to apply to many of us here.

0:23:17.360,0:23:26.740
Time you don't actually need - there is nothing to do out there: no job, no game, nothing -

0:23:26.740,0:23:30.640
"What would I do at home? Let me go to church."

0:23:30.640,0:23:33.480
You should commit not only the time you don't need.

0:23:33.480,0:23:40.420
You should be part of your church - not only attending the Sunday service.

0:23:40.420,0:23:48.520
You should ask, "What can I do? Look at the church - it is very clean. Who cleaned it?

0:23:48.520,0:23:56.240
Will I just come and sit? No! I must join the department".

0:23:56.240,0:24:05.260
Once a week - find a day to help the department in what they do.

0:24:05.260,0:24:12.200
Join an evangelical department - it is your home.

0:24:12.200,0:24:14.200
Money, money, money - no!

0:24:14.200,0:24:23.860
Money cannot bring contentment but giving it to help the poor can.

So, New Year is coming.

0:24:37.680,0:24:43.320
There is no other way to prepare for the New Year.

0:24:43.320,0:24:48.600
The best way is to allow love to lead.

0:24:48.600,0:24:55.080
If love must lead you, you must consider the way and manner you do things,

0:24:55.080,0:24:57.440
the way and manner you give things,

0:24:57.440,0:24:59.540
the way and manner you sleep,

0:24:59.540,0:25:01.660
the way and manner you sit,

0:25:01.660,0:25:03.520
the way and manner you look,

0:25:03.520,0:25:08.220
the way and manner you dress,

0:25:08.220,0:25:11.520
the way and manner you walk,

0:25:11.520,0:25:16.100
the way and manner you greet,

0:25:16.100,0:25:24.780
the way and manner you do things you must consider – that is love.

0:25:24.780,0:25:30.780
In a manner that pleases God, that is what we call love.

0:25:30.780,0:25:41.500
Not to just give, help - but the manner you help, give or greet.

0:25:48.460,0:26:00.240
Rise up, let’s lift up our voice to God, to help us serve Him with all our talent

0:26:00.240,0:26:04.340
because we have not been serving God with all our talent.

0:26:04.340,0:26:15.700
The manner and way we serve God with our talent, our love is not pleasing to Him.

0:26:15.700,0:26:23.960
Open your lips, ask God, “Help me to serve You with all my talent – my labour of love”.

0:26:23.960,0:26:28.980
Prayer!

0:26:28.980,0:26:36.780
I want to serve You Lord with all my talent!

0:26:50.600,0:26:51.580
(Amen.)

0:26:51.580,0:26:52.840
Yes.

0:26:52.840,0:26:56.840
You are here today - this is not your quality time that you give to God.

0:26:56.840,0:27:00.160
Many of you will come here next Sunday again.

0:27:00.160,0:27:01.580
That's all.

0:27:01.580,0:27:04.040
That is the way you serve God.

0:27:04.040,0:27:08.380
Ask Him, "Lord, Your grace in this coming year."

0:27:08.380,0:27:11.380
You have to prepare now for the New Year.

0:27:11.380,0:27:12.540
This is the way to prepare.

0:27:12.540,0:27:20.640
You have to realise your mistakes - this is what you need to do right, now.

0:27:20.640,0:27:26.560
My talent, my gift - about people, about God.

0:27:26.560,0:27:38.560
Ask Him, "Lord Jesus, give me the grace to serve You with all my talent, my love, my time.”

0:27:38.560,0:27:40.440
Prayer!

0:27:40.440,0:27:44.140
You need grace.
