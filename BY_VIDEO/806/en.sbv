Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:03.340,0:00:06.380
Good morning Church.

0:00:06.380,0:00:09.980
My name is Oksana Ojeba.

0:00:09.980,0:00:11.880
I am from Ukraine.

0:00:11.880,0:00:15.700
My husband is from Kogi State in Nigeria.

0:00:15.700,0:00:19.660
I have been here for 15 years.

0:00:19.660,0:00:24.420
When I was in Ukraine and I was 16 years old,

0:00:24.420,0:00:29.120
I met my husband in my country, and I saw him as a very handsome man.

0:00:29.120,0:00:32.800
Something inside me told me that he was my husband.

0:00:32.800,0:00:37.180
I was with him for five years as a friend.

0:00:37.180,0:00:43.720
When my husband finished university, he wanted to go back to Nigeria

0:00:43.720,0:00:45.460
and I was pregnant.

0:00:45.460,0:00:52.140
I begged him to marry me because the child would not be my colour

0:00:52.140,0:00:54.980
and if I was not married, no one would like my child.

0:00:54.980,0:00:59.040
After my husband married me, I said, 'Thank God'.

0:00:59.040,0:01:02.700
When my husband was in my country, he suffered.

0:01:02.700,0:01:09.400
No one gave him work; my husband was buying and selling clothes.

0:01:09.400,0:01:11.500
He was really suffering.

0:01:11.500,0:01:21.400
After I saw that my child was not happy and my husband was suffering because of colour,

0:01:21.400,0:01:28.240
I started praying to God that I would be able to bring my husband to Nigeria.

0:01:28.240,0:01:36.560
Before we came to Nigeria, my husband was very sick spiritually.

0:01:36.560,0:01:44.080
He had another woman who got pregnant for him.

0:01:44.080,0:01:55.060
The woman started disturbing him to come to her but I said no, that we should go to Nigeria.

0:01:55.060,0:02:03.780
When I got to Nigeria, I was very happy when people welcomed me.

0:02:03.780,0:02:09.360
When I got to Nigeria, I was very happy when I, my children and my husband were welcomed.

0:02:09.360,0:02:17.440
When I came, I saw that everybody wanted to play with my children.

0:02:17.440,0:02:22.640
I saw my husband's eyes became clear and he was very happy.

0:02:22.640,0:02:31.920
He was speaking a better language. I was very happy because I saw that he was free.

0:02:31.920,0:02:39.700
But later, my husband did not get work again in Nigeria.

0:02:39.700,0:02:53.140
After I gave birth to two children here, my husband started going from one woman to another.

0:02:53.140,0:03:02.960
When I saw that my husband was not happy and no one was helping him, I looked for help.

0:03:02.960,0:03:12.480
I saw a canteen woman who helped me with a job and paid me 7,000 naira.

0:03:12.480,0:03:15.040
I was washing plates and serving people.

0:03:15.040,0:03:21.780
I prayed to God to give me another job and then someone asked me to help train chicken.

0:03:21.780,0:03:27.580
I got paid 2,000 or 3,000 naira.

0:03:27.580,0:03:34.700
Nobody helped me. My daughter was hungry to the extent that she would

0:03:34.700,0:03:42.380
use a razor blade, cut herself and write on her body, 'I hate you'.

0:03:42.380,0:03:51.520
Sometimes, I would peel cassava and somebody would help me to fry gari.

0:03:51.520,0:03:57.220
I would cook and eat Nigerian food.

0:03:57.220,0:04:05.580
I want to get help from someone for my husband.

0:04:05.580,0:04:11.000
I want my husband to be happy and smile.

0:04:11.000,0:04:14.220
Please, Man of God, help my husband!

0:04:14.220,0:04:23.860
I want to thank God because when I came to The SCOAN, I had only 20,000 naira.

0:04:23.860,0:04:31.180
I did not think about where I would stay in a hotel; I only wanted to come to the church.

0:04:31.180,0:04:34.680
I asked the ushers to help me.

0:04:34.680,0:04:42.520
T.B. Joshua paid for my hotel and feeding.

0:04:42.520,0:04:45.780
I want to thank T.B. Joshua so much

0:04:45.780,0:04:49.340
because I did not sleep on the streets but in a hotel.

0:04:49.340,0:04:51.760
Mrs Oksana Ojeba - Shares Life Experience

0:04:51.760,0:04:57.780
This is my husband - my darling, my angel.

0:04:57.780,0:05:02.160
If it was not for my husband, I would not understand who God is.

0:05:02.160,0:05:06.280
He was the one who brought me to God.

0:05:06.280,0:05:08.600
This is me.

0:05:08.600,0:05:12.520
This is my son who is 26 years old.

0:05:12.520,0:05:17.240
This is me during our wedding.

0:05:17.240,0:05:20.560
So we can see in the photograph - she said this was her wedding day

0:05:20.560,0:05:23.740
and we can see her husband standing behind her.

0:05:23.740,0:05:26.800
She said that her husband is her darling husband, her angel

0:05:26.800,0:05:30.700
and she thanks God that despite the condition they are in,

0:05:30.700,0:05:35.580
he has stayed with her; they have been together and he is a loving husband to her.

0:05:35.580,0:05:39.920
These are my daughters.

0:05:39.920,0:05:42.260
This is my son.

0:05:42.260,0:05:47.260
We can see there her son - her first son on the screen there.

0:05:47.260,0:05:50.640
All of them have been living in this suffering condition for many years.

0:05:50.640,0:05:53.940
But as she has come here today to The SCOAN,

0:05:53.940,0:05:58.360
we truly believe, Madam, that your needs will be met in Christ Jesus.

0:06:00.140,0:06:04.600
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:06:04.940,0:06:07.440
My name is Oksana Ojeba.

0:06:07.460,0:06:09.320
I am from Ukraine.

0:06:09.320,0:06:13.700
The problem that brought me here was poverty.

0:06:13.700,0:06:23.220
I got married in my country, Ukraine, to my husband who is a Nigerian.

0:06:23.220,0:06:26.260
My husband was at University in Ukraine.

0:06:26.260,0:06:32.480
When he finished university, he did not find a job.

0:06:32.480,0:06:36.880
He was selling clothes, and it was not easy for him.

0:06:36.880,0:06:41.520
I came to Nigeria and gave birth to two more children.

0:06:41.520,0:06:45.380
I could not get a job and was suffering.

0:06:45.380,0:06:53.960
I was moving up and down, begging for my children and my husband but nobody helped.

0:06:53.960,0:06:59.940
I came to The SCOAN for God to help me.

0:06:59.940,0:07:04.140

0:07:30.340,0:07:33.320
Thank you so much, T.B. Joshua.

0:07:33.320,0:07:40.980
I thank the God of T.B. Joshua for not forgetting me and for hearing my prayers.

0:07:40.980,0:07:46.540

so make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:08:06.000,0:08:11.580
Jesus Christ does not promise to keep us away from trials, tests or poverty,

0:08:11.580,0:08:14.140
but He promised to be with us and to see us through.

0:08:14.140,0:08:19.200
As God Almighty has shown you that at last, the end to your poverty has come,

0:08:19.200,0:08:20.880
the end to your problem has come,

0:08:20.880,0:08:24.720
it is time for you to live in the light of your testimony in Jesus' name.

0:08:24.720,0:08:25.540
Amen.

0:08:25.540,0:08:27.380
Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:27.380,0:08:29.800
Thank you, Emmanuel TV.
