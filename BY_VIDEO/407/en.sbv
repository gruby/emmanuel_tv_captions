(Who are you?

0:00:42.540,0:00:43.040
Huh?)

0:00:43.040,0:00:44.000
Why do you want to know.

0:00:44.000,0:00:45.220
(What have you done to him?)

0:00:45.220,0:00:46.480
I have destroyed his education.

0:00:46.760,0:00:47.840
(Who are you inside of him?)

0:00:47.840,0:00:48.880
I am an Idol.

0:00:49.320,0:00:50.200
(You are an Idol.

0:00:50.620,0:00:52.620
What have you done to his family?)

0:00:53.640,0:00:54.860
There is no prosperity in his family.

0:00:55.380,0:00:56.560
{Who remove the prosperity?}

0:00:57.880,0:00:59.080
I am the one.

0:00:59.080,0:01:00.160
{You are the one,

0:01:00.160,0:01:02.160
Why did you destroy his education?}

0:01:02.620,0:01:05.060
He is at the university,
I made him drink alcohol.

0:01:06.160,0:01:09.120
I make him drink, he can take a
 packet of cigarettes in 30 minutes

0:01:09.900,0:01:10.920
{within 30 minutes?}

0:01:10.920,0:01:11.420
Yes

0:01:11.700,0:01:12.300
{Three packets?}

0:01:12.560,0:01:13.060
Yes!

0:01:13.340,0:01:15.060
{Why did you make that to him?}

0:01:17.200,0:01:18.280
That makes me happy.

0:01:18.540,0:01:19.200
{That makes you happy?}

0:01:19.200,0:01:19.700
Yes!

0:01:20.400,0:01:22.600
{Okay, how do you normally operate in his life?}

0:01:23.880,0:01:24.860
I operate through dreams.

0:01:25.000,0:01:25.700
{Through dreams?}

0:01:25.780,0:01:26.280
Yes

0:01:26.400,0:01:27.060
{How?}

0:01:27.500,0:01:29.960
I sleep with him in dreams

0:01:30.640,0:01:32.640
{Out! in the name of Jesus.

0:01:44.450,0:01:46.450

{In Jesus name, thank you lord!

0:01:53.540,0:01:55.400
You are free in the name of Jesus,

0:01:58.120,0:01:58.940
How are you?}

0:01:59.280,0:02:00.240
I am good.

0:02:00.920,0:02:02.520
So Jesus Christ has delivered you,}

0:02:02.520,0:02:03.412
Thank you Jesus I'm free.

0:02:03.420,0:02:03.920
{You are free!}

0:02:08.260,0:02:10.380
I am Mr Jesse Delali 
I'm from Ghana

0:02:11.320,0:02:16.560
My testimony goes like this, 
I've lived 21 years of my life for the devil.

0:02:16.880,0:02:20.900
This whole thing started when I was
 8 years old,

0:02:21.380,0:02:24.600
I was taken to my Grandmothers
 hometown for a funeral.

0:02:25.240,0:02:29.120
After which I saw the way my 
people were worshiping Idols,

0:02:29.120,0:02:31.915
so I was kind of enticed and got interested in it.

0:02:31.915,0:02:34.040
So I go closer to that place and then

0:02:34.970,0:02:38.050
looked at the way they were 
kind of performing the rituals.

0:02:38.600,0:02:42.500
After that, that day I went home, 
and then I just developed

0:02:42.500,0:02:43.870
a habit of stealing.

0:02:44.260,0:02:45.640
{Okay before you go ahead

0:02:45.640,0:02:47.979
can you just tell us the home you brought up in

0:02:47.980,0:02:49.820
and the type of background you were from?}

0:02:50.160,0:02:54.160
I was brought up from a very strict and Christian home.

0:02:54.920,0:02:57.060
My dad was very strict and academician

0:02:57.060,0:02:59.420
and then my mum was also very prayerful.

0:03:00.420,0:03:01.400
Yeah, that was the kind of home I was brought up in.

0:03:01.700,0:03:03.440
{So you're brought up in a strict Christian home

0:03:03.440,0:03:05.019
but when you were eight years old

0:03:05.020,0:03:07.220
you went to the village for a funeral.

0:03:07.960,0:03:09.700
And tell us exactly what happened,

0:03:09.800,0:03:11.760
when you went to that funeral, 
what did you see there?}

0:03:12.100,0:03:17.860
Yeah, When I went for the funeral, I 
realized my dad home, his grandparents

0:03:18.480,0:03:19.800
They were Idol worshipers.

0:03:20.680,0:03:25.180
So they would use their mouth to 
bite the head oft a live chicken,

0:03:25.680,0:03:27.380
so I got interested in it;

0:03:27.380,0:03:30.240
and I got closer to see how 
they were performing their rituals.

0:03:30.760,0:03:33.980
{So as a small boy, you were just 
watching closely as they were performing

0:03:33.980,0:03:36.540
this ritual and then what happened to you?}

0:03:37.040,0:03:40.874
From that day, I came home and
 then I just developed

0:03:40.874,0:03:43.750
the habit of picking stuffs from the house.

0:03:44.440,0:03:45.040
Yeah

0:03:46.060,0:03:49.740
{So from that age of eight as
you returned from this funeral

0:03:49.740,0:03:50.920
You began to steal?}

0:03:51.280,0:03:51.780
Yeah.

0:03:52.100,0:03:54.580
{Okay, can you just tell us more
 about how this developed

0:03:54.580,0:03:57.200
and how serious this spirit 
of stealing became?}

0:03:59.380,0:04:03.940
This thing developed from 
stage to stage as a young guy.

0:04:04.400,0:04:06.760
I could go into my parents
 room and steal their money.

0:04:07.600,0:04:10.820
It got to a time, because of
 this stealing habits,

0:04:10.820,0:04:12.620
I took it from home to outside.

0:04:12.620,0:04:14.980
I started taking things from my friends.

0:04:14.980,0:04:18.320
I easily made friends, when I 
got to a place I would make friends.

0:04:18.840,0:04:20.360
I ended up taking stuff from them.

0:04:21.000,0:04:27.420
Because of this thing, I was expelled
 from about two junior high schools

0:04:27.420,0:04:28.600
before I went to senior high school.

0:04:29.100,0:04:31.840
And when I went to senior high school,
 I was still in this mess.

0:04:32.360,0:04:38.000
I went to the university and I met friends
 who were spending money.

0:04:38.580,0:04:41.280
So I asked them how they 
made their money?

0:04:42.100,0:04:45.180
{So before you go to that level, tell us for example

0:04:45.180,0:04:47.360
the type of things you would steal and how

0:04:47.360,0:04:49.060
you would go about stealing those items.

0:04:49.060,0:04:51.980
Anytime that spirit of stealing came into you?}

0:04:53.000,0:04:56.480
I would steal money, money was the thing

0:04:56.480,0:04:57.680
I would steal most of the time.

0:04:58.040,0:05:02.620
I would enter room; I wont be
 their when they hide the money.

0:05:03.040,0:05:08.580
But I can enter the room, sit down
 and I could smell the money in that room.

0:05:09.720,0:05:11.800
I needed the money, I would close my eyes

0:05:12.120,0:05:13.615
for two minutes and open my eyes;

0:05:13.615,0:05:15.880
I would just move straight to
 where the money was kept.

0:05:16.080,0:05:18.080
And l would just pick it.

0:05:18.740,0:05:22.520
{So even if that money is hidden in a very secret place,

0:05:22.520,0:05:24.880
once you entered the room and 
close your eyes

0:05:25.320,0:05:28.520
a spirit would push you to 
know where that money is located?}

0:05:29.080,0:05:29.580
Yeah

0:05:30.220,0:05:34.100
{How much money were you 
stealing on a regular basis?}

0:05:34.700,0:05:37.380
I was stealing thousands of dollars.

0:05:37.760,0:05:40.280
I was stealing money, I was into 
stealing money from my home.

0:05:40.960,0:05:42.440
{And what were you using this 
money to do.

0:05:42.440,0:05:43.940
what were you using this money for?}

0:05:44.660,0:05:46.660
I would go and buy good stuff for my self,

0:05:46.660,0:05:49.280
I would buy shoes and shirts.

0:05:51.780,0:05:53.520
{Okay, so we are hearing from our brother

0:05:53.520,0:05:55.660
he is explaining how from the age of 8,

0:05:55.660,0:05:58.880
he began to develop a habit of stealing after

0:05:58.880,0:06:01.140
he went to funeral where he witnessed

0:06:01.140,0:06:05.260
idol worship and a specific ritual being performed.

0:06:05.260,0:06:09.260
And he said anytime he used to go
 into a room to steal

0:06:09.550,0:06:11.748
a spirit would communicate to him where

0:06:11.748,0:06:14.960
that money was located and he would be able to steal.

0:06:15.100,0:06:17.383
He has stolen thousands of Dollars,

0:06:17.383,0:06:20.320
and he would just use this money to live a very lavish

0:06:20.320,0:06:22.120
lifestyle - flamboyant lifestyle.

0:06:22.640,0:06:25.919
So tell us, as you got older how did this develop

0:06:25.920,0:06:27.860
become even more serious?}

0:06:28.460,0:06:30.740
This became serious when I got to university;

0:06:31.120,0:06:35.100
when I got to university, I met friends who were spending money,

0:06:35.100,0:06:37.980
they were living kind of big life.

0:06:37.980,0:06:40.660
So with the kind of money that I was 
getting from home was not enough,

0:06:40.660,0:06:42.960
since my dad was very strict;
he started restricting me.

0:06:43.440,0:06:47.220
So I asked them how they made their money,

0:06:47.800,0:06:51.420
and then I was introduced to how they got their money.

0:06:51.980,0:06:55.480
Initially they did not want to tell me,
 but upon several pressurization

0:06:55.480,0:06:57.600
I was introduced to how they made their money;

0:06:57.600,0:07:01.020
which I also got enticed into it,
and I started getting my money.

0:07:01.840,0:07:05.100
It involved spiritualist.

0:07:06.220,0:07:09.520
Firstly, and I was given a spiritualist number

0:07:09.520,0:07:12.420
that I called on phone, and I told
 him I need money.

0:07:12.780,0:07:16.400
So he gave me some options which I chose one

0:07:16.400,0:07:18.720
out of the numerous options 
he gave me.

0:07:19.240,0:07:20.380
Which I went in for.

0:07:20.860,0:07:25.080
He gave me several options,
 some of the options were like

0:07:26.200,0:07:35.800
'wallet money', 'instant money', 'gods money', 'banks money' and 'do as I say'

0:07:38.320,0:07:43.500
Wallet money for instance, 
way back in my country ,

0:07:44.520,0:07:47.200
The biggest currency we use  is 50 Ghana Cedis,

0:07:48.020,0:07:54.220
now you would send an empty
 wallet to the spiritualists.

0:07:55.520,0:07:57.520
When you send the wallet to him,

0:07:57.520,0:08:00.300
He will command the 50 Cedis into your wallet.

0:08:00.300,0:08:02.360
With that 50 Cedis you can use to buy a car,

0:08:02.560,0:08:05.400
You can use to buy a house, 
you can use to buy anything you want to.

0:08:06.040,0:08:07.060
It works this way,

0:08:08.200,0:08:12.400
you go out there and use the 50 cedis
 to purchase something from a store.

0:08:12.900,0:08:14.910
Now when you use that money to 
buy something from the store,

0:08:14.910,0:08:16.910
let's say you buy something like 5 Cedis out of it,

0:08:17.140,0:08:18.300
and change will be given to you.

0:08:18.940,0:08:20.660
When that change is given to you,

0:08:20.660,0:08:23.280
you keep that change separate from where the wallet is.

0:08:23.280,0:08:25.240
You put your wallets back into your pocket,

0:08:25.600,0:08:28.240
30 seconds after the money you 
used to purchase

0:08:28.240,0:08:29.638
something from the store,

0:08:29.640,0:08:31.780
the man you come back into your wallet.

0:08:32.520,0:08:34.740
So depending  on the number 
of stores you go within a day,

0:08:35.060,0:08:38.300
that will determined the amount 
of money you get within day.

0:08:40.000,0:08:43.260
Brethren, if you are not a good Christian 
or someone who prays,

0:08:43.260,0:08:44.766
and that money mixes with your money.

0:08:44.766,0:08:46.760
Lets say you are a trader and
 that money mixes with your money,

0:08:47.280,0:08:49.280
Within six months your money goes to the drain,

0:08:49.280,0:08:51.720
and you cant account for anything.

0:08:52.520,0:08:53.960
That was the first option.

0:08:54.480,0:08:57.600
{Okay, now before going ahead 
when you went to

0:08:57.600,0:09:00.820
this spiritualist to involve yourself 
and these money rituals.

0:09:01.240,0:09:05.177
What were the conditions laid down,
 what were the things he asked you to bring

0:09:05.177,0:09:07.120
And the conditions that were laid down

0:09:07.120,0:09:10.600
before he went ahead to do 
these specific money rituals?}

0:09:12.220,0:09:13.400
When you call them on phone

0:09:13.760,0:09:16.960
Initially, they would tell you 'no blood' 
they don't need blood from you.

0:09:17.529,0:09:20.273
So when you go to them, they would ask you

0:09:20.280,0:09:21.920
to bring an amount of money.

0:09:22.280,0:09:26.380
Which you will use to go buy 
some stuff from the market.

0:09:27.080,0:09:29.060
And he would tell you that
 was going to call your star.

0:09:29.800,0:09:34.260
If your star responds, that will determine
 the amount of money are going to get.

0:09:35.900,0:09:38.940
First, I was asked to bring an
 amount of money which I sent.

0:09:39.720,0:09:43.460
and they used to buy certain 
things from the market.

0:09:43.960,0:09:47.000
And then he called my star,
 my star came,

0:09:47.000,0:09:49.800
and then he asked me the
 amount of money that I wanted.

0:09:51.180,0:09:57.560
My amount options was actually instant money.

0:09:58.100,0:10:02.020
So he poured powder in my hand and
 asked me how much money I needed.

0:10:02.260,0:10:03.820
And I mentioned the amount that I needed.

0:10:04.240,0:10:07.280
Then he did some things for about 20 minutes

0:10:07.920,0:10:10.760
and he opened a box and the
 money was in the box.

0:10:10.760,0:10:13.200
The exact amount I was looking 
for was in the box.

0:10:14.140,0:10:18.600
So, I took it to campus and started spending it.

0:10:19.400,0:10:22.324
It got to a time I flattered the whole office,

0:10:22.324,0:10:25.120
and then he asked me to bring human blood.

0:10:26.200,0:10:29.400
I told him that I  wasn't doing  it, 
in fact I called him on phone and insulted him.

0:10:30.680,0:10:32.680
And then I moved to a different spiritualist.

0:10:33.620,0:10:36.267
{So you said that initially they told you that

0:10:36.267,0:10:37.960
you would not require blood.

0:10:38.560,0:10:42.960
But once you had used this ritual
 and obtained instant money

0:10:42.960,0:10:47.140
When you now return to that spiritualist 
to get more he demanded for blood?}

0:10:48.420,0:10:49.100
Yeah

0:10:49.900,0:10:53.340
{Okay, now tell us what was the amount that you

0:10:53.440,0:10:54.793
collected through this instant money?

0:10:54.793,0:10:56.730
And once again what were the conditions attached?

0:10:56.770,0:10:58.192
How you would use this money,

0:10:58.200,0:11:00.504
and the things you could not use this money to do?}

0:11:01.000,0:11:02.420
You know for the first person,

0:11:02.420,0:11:05.340
when the money comes; you would
 go and deposit the money in a bank.

0:11:06.100,0:11:07.735
After which you will go and withdraw part of

0:11:07.735,0:11:08.850
the money and come give to him.

0:11:09.520,0:11:13.580
So for the second person, I went to him

0:11:13.580,0:11:15.360
and he also gave me his options.

0:11:15.780,0:11:17.040
And then I chose what I wanted

0:11:17.460,0:11:18.920
He said that  when the money comes,

0:11:18.920,0:11:22.660
I have to give 30 Cedis out of it
 to  three virgins.

0:11:23.280,0:11:27.980
The kids who are growing up, 
before spending your money.

0:11:29.980,0:11:33.220
For them, virtually  they will never
 give birth in their entire life again.

0:11:34.160,0:11:36.600
{I hope we understand what our brother just said

0:11:36.600,0:11:38.702
so the condition attached was that you

0:11:38.702,0:11:42.020
had to give some of this money to three virgins.

0:11:42.320,0:11:45.660
And what would happen to those 
girls once you gave them the money?}

0:11:46.720,0:11:48.240
When I give them the money,
 and they spend their money

0:11:48.970,0:11:52.199
they will never give birth in the entire life.

0:11:53.080,0:11:56.000
Yes, I know most of my friends
 were also engaged in all this,

0:11:56.780,0:11:59.200
He told me that it was my star that wanted

0:11:59.200,0:12:00.880
to give the money for the virgins.

0:12:01.460,0:12:03.734
Most of my friends that were also in this,

0:12:03.740,0:12:05.900
had their rules and what they had to do.

0:12:06.680,0:12:09.380
My friend for instance his rule was,

0:12:09.380,0:12:14.460
when women have the menstruation 
and then they throw their pads outside,

0:12:15.400,0:12:18.480
He pays people to go pick them
 and bring it to him

0:12:18.480,0:12:21.560
and then he will take you to the 
ritualist for his star cleansing.

0:12:21.560,0:12:24.960
When a woman pad gets in there, 
she will never give birth again

0:12:25.900,0:12:28.180
There was no way she was going
 to give birth in her entire life again.

0:12:29.720,0:12:32.760
{Okay, so what our brother is 
saying is that the spiritualist

0:12:32.760,0:12:36.540
would give different conditions 
according to the person that came to

0:12:36.540,0:12:38.140
him before doing the money rituals.

0:12:38.140,0:12:41.360
in the case of our brother, when he
 was given this instant money,

0:12:41.360,0:12:43.960
the condition was he had to give a certain amount of

0:12:43.960,0:12:46.520
this money to three virgin girls.

0:12:47.200,0:12:49.973
And whoever collected that 
money, once they spent it

0:12:49.973,0:12:53.280
they would never be able to
 give birth again in their life.

0:12:53.389,0:12:56.289
And other friends of his had conditions whereby

0:12:56.480,0:12:59.400
If a woman dropped her menstruation pads somewhere

0:12:59.400,0:13:01.100
in a public place or on the floor,

0:13:01.100,0:13:04.120
he would pay someone to collect 
those menstruation pads;

0:13:04.120,0:13:07.320
bring it to the ritualist and from that point forward

0:13:07.620,0:13:09.736
the person who dropped their menstruation pad

0:13:09.736,0:13:12.040
would never be able to have a child in their life.

0:13:12.410,0:13:14.574
So continued brother tell us more about

0:13:14.580,0:13:16.300
your activities with these ritualists?}

0:13:16.680,0:13:20.400
When I went to this with ritualists they gave me options,

0:13:20.960,0:13:26.240
In Ghana we have people who run micro finances; savings and loan companies.

0:13:26.900,0:13:29.700
Most of the serving and loan companies that I knew

0:13:30.100,0:13:31.220
were also into this.

0:13:31.600,0:13:33.620
They also had their option, now they would go

0:13:33.620,0:13:36.560
for money from this people then come to give as loan.

0:13:36.760,0:13:41.260
If you have a company or an asset and
 you use it as a collateral to take loan

0:13:41.260,0:13:43.280
and you are not prayerful, forget it!

0:13:43.660,0:13:46.320
That asset that you used as
 a collateral become a liability.

0:13:46.690,0:13:48.980
There was no way you could pay
 that money back.

0:13:48.980,0:13:51.400
So then eventually your assets become theirs.

0:13:55.360,0:13:57.720
{So just to explain more about how you

0:13:57.720,0:14:00.320
would do this spiritual transaction with the bank

0:14:00.560,0:14:01.980
to deceive people to do a loan.

0:14:02.200,0:14:04.980
Just explained very clearly to 
people how you would go about it?}

0:14:05.900,0:14:09.240
Okay with a bank issue, they would charm

0:14:09.240,0:14:10.200
the money for you

0:14:10.660,0:14:14.080
Let me talk about the savings and loan aspect.

0:14:14.480,0:14:16.200
Now you go to him for a loan

0:14:16.320,0:14:20.460
he would take your assets;
 something valuable that would be

0:14:20.460,0:14:23.140
more than the money you are taking as a collateral

0:14:23.420,0:14:25.800
And then he will give you the money you want

0:14:25.800,0:14:28.320
now if you are a good Christian someone who prays,

0:14:28.320,0:14:30.280
forget! there was no way you could pay the money back.

0:14:31.040,0:14:35.080
So then what you used as a 
collateral will eventually becomes his.

0:14:35.080,0:14:36.399
because you can't pay the money back.

0:14:37.190,0:14:42.069
When this money comes, you 
will be asked to deposit it in a bank.

0:14:42.709,0:14:44.890
When you deposit the money into the bank,

0:14:44.890,0:14:47.018
the bank will mix it with your money,

0:14:47.600,0:14:51.670
and then you go for a fresh money, 
and if let's say the owner of the bank

0:14:52.230,0:14:54.239
the managerial part of the bank are not prayerful,

0:14:54.760,0:14:58.020
they would  face crisis in their banking business

0:14:58.020,0:15:00.299
because their money is going to go in a drain.

0:15:00.850,0:15:02.850
Because what I was made to know

0:15:03.400,0:15:09.360
was the spirit that gave the money, was from the sea.

0:15:10.180,0:15:14.140
So when they come out there,
 mix their money with our money;

0:15:14.140,0:15:16.351
then they drain the money back 
to the sea

0:15:16.351,0:15:19.640
so they keep it there so when 
someone goes to them for money

0:15:19.650,0:15:21.650
They can get the money and 
give to the person.

0:15:21.760,0:15:24.035
So when these money started coming up,

0:15:24.035,0:15:26.429
I started drinking, smoking, I was on drugs,

0:15:27.600,0:15:31.620
womanizing, clubbing, all sort of ungodly things.

0:15:31.980,0:15:37.480
First academically l was good, but when
 I started involving myself in this situation

0:15:37.480,0:15:39.160
I came down, I felt totally

0:15:39.520,0:15:43.710
My dad was someone who was so
 strict  when it comes to academics.

0:15:43.710,0:15:46.000
Before you go ahead you talked 
about the lifestyle

0:15:46.000,0:15:47.760
you were living can you just explain 
more about

0:15:48.010,0:15:49.926
all this money you were receiving from

0:15:49.926,0:15:51.540
the ritualist -  ritual money.

0:15:51.640,0:15:53.680
What were you using it for if you can't explain more.

0:15:53.680,0:15:56.520
Like you said you drink, smoke
 - how much were you smoking?

0:15:56.530,0:15:58.580
What were you drinking?
 How much drugs were you?

0:15:58.580,0:16:01.889
taking for people to understand 
how you were wasting this money?}

0:16:02.500,0:16:06.340
I could take about 22 - 23  packet
 of cigarettes within a day

0:16:07.100,0:16:08.760
I drank bottles of vodka.

0:16:09.300,0:16:13.000
I was on drugs; high drugs, cocaine, weed
I was also on pills.

0:16:13.700,0:16:17.574
I would go out there in club,
 I would blow money, throw money on air.

0:16:17.580,0:16:19.420
People would see that I was around.

0:16:20.040,0:16:24.040
Anywhere I found myself, I wanted
 my present to be felt by people.

0:16:24.940,0:16:28.200
Because I was getting money, I could
 command money anytime I wanted.

0:16:29.040,0:16:31.540
So that was the kind of lifestyle was living.

0:16:31.540,0:16:33.860
{So the money you received from this ritualists,

0:16:34.020,0:16:37.360
you could only use it for devilish purposes.

0:16:37.620,0:16:39.644
You could never use it for anything that would help you;

0:16:39.644,0:16:42.020
benefit you or glorify God?}

0:16:42.900,0:16:44.100
When you start using this money,

0:16:44.100,0:16:48.300
the mindsets won't come, that you
 should use it to do something good.

0:16:48.760,0:16:50.660
I was the type, any place I found myself

0:16:50.660,0:16:52.540
as I said earlier on I easily made friends.

0:16:53.020,0:16:56.160
yet when someone told me he's problem,

0:16:56.320,0:17:00.000
I feel pity for the person, but knowing
 where the money is coming from,

0:17:00.520,0:17:02.440
I just don't want to give that money to the person.

0:17:03.160,0:17:05.560
So I used to earn monthly income from my dad,

0:17:05.900,0:17:07.520
So when that money comes,  I would give that

0:17:07.520,0:17:08.840
money to the people who need 
money form me.

0:17:08.840,0:17:10.720
and then I would be spending the 
money that I commanding.

0:17:11.170,0:17:12.840
Yeah, that was what I was doing.

0:17:12.840,0:17:15.460
There was a times in school, 
I started giving loans to people.

0:17:15.740,0:17:17.440
When a person comes to me and tell me his problem,

0:17:17.900,0:17:19.700
I would ask you why you need the money

0:17:20.100,0:17:23.140
If let's say your problem is kind of family problem

0:17:23.140,0:17:24.200
and you need money and stuff.

0:17:24.700,0:17:27.660
Willingly I will give you the loan,
 from the money my dad gave me

0:17:27.980,0:17:29.160
and you wont pay back.

0:17:29.470,0:17:32.640
But when you say you want let's 
say to use it for clubbing,

0:17:32.640,0:17:34.169
and I know you, you have been clubbing.
 then you are in trouble.

0:17:34.560,0:17:37.100
I would take your laptop, something bigger than

0:17:37.100,0:17:38.160
the amount I want to give you.

0:17:38.160,0:17:41.240
I would sell that day because I knew
 you cant pay the money back.

0:17:41.950,0:17:43.410
There was no you can pay the money back.

0:17:43.410,0:17:46.340
So I would give it to you a loan and sell that day.

0:17:46.620,0:17:49.160
Even if I give you three years to 
pay the money, you can't pay back.

0:17:50.620,0:17:53.100
{So I hope we are listening to our brothers saying

0:17:53.100,0:17:55.500
that because the source of the money he was receiving

0:17:55.680,0:17:58.260
was demonic and devilish he never had the

0:17:58.274,0:18:00.479
mindset to use it for anything good.

0:18:00.480,0:18:02.540
He couldn't use it to help people.

0:18:02.540,0:18:04.260
He couldn't use it to give to people.

0:18:04.260,0:18:08.400
He could only use it for things such as clubbing, drinking

0:18:08.460,0:18:10.500
womanizing and taking drugs.

0:18:10.760,0:18:15.100
He said he was smoking up to 20
 packets of cigarettes in a single day

0:18:15.360,0:18:19.020
As a result of all of this money he was using.

0:18:19.020,0:18:21.000
And tell us, how did this affect you in terms of your

0:18:21.160,0:18:23.369
education and your life generally?}

0:18:23.880,0:18:26.540
From onset I was good academically;

0:18:26.540,0:18:28.920
my dad was someone who so
 strict when it came to academics

0:18:29.520,0:18:33.200
So I was so good, but I when I started entangling

0:18:33.200,0:18:36.780
myself with this kind of ungodly act,

0:18:37.510,0:18:39.510
my academics fell.

0:18:39.760,0:18:46.960
I went back to the spiritualist and told
 him that my academics has gone down

0:18:47.260,0:18:52.060
So he gave me a concoction which
 I used to bath with it at midnight.

0:18:52.060,0:18:54.900
And take some each time I wanted to study.

0:18:55.460,0:19:01.760
When I took that stuff I realized that
 everything I studied it stuck in my head.

0:19:02.280,0:19:07.440
{Brother you mentioned earlier 
that the first ritualist you went to

0:19:08.140,0:19:10.769
Initially they did not demand for blood but later

0:19:10.769,0:19:13.290
on they started demanding for blood now tell us

0:19:13.420,0:19:15.480
when this witch doctor demanded for blood,

0:19:15.480,0:19:18.000
what was your reaction? 
What did you do thereafter?}

0:19:18.760,0:19:21.580
Personally, I've been to about five witch doctors,

0:19:22.180,0:19:24.660
each time they demanded for blood, I would insult them.

0:19:24.760,0:19:27.360
I would tell them that from the onset, 
they told me that there was no blood.

0:19:27.520,0:19:31.540
There was a time I was attacked, 
physically, I would see them in my dreams.

0:19:31.820,0:19:35.320
There was a time I saw one physically
 threatening that I have spent his money

0:19:35.420,0:19:37.684
and it was time for me to give him something,

0:19:37.684,0:19:39.420
and I was refusing so he was going
 to kill me.

0:19:39.640,0:19:42.560
The next day I took a phone I 
called him and I insulted him,

0:19:43.040,0:19:44.640
then I moved to a different spiritualist.

0:19:45.104,0:19:48.700
So each time, they try to doing
 something, I would just insult them.

0:19:51.140,0:19:53.798
{You mentioned is well, we're just
 asking these questions

0:19:53.800,0:19:55.580
for us to learn so we too can identify

0:19:55.620,0:19:59.480
what's been happening in society
 in our lives

0:19:59.480,0:20:01.920
so we can be careful and conscious of it.

0:20:02.100,0:20:04.380
You mentioned that there were
 different types of money

0:20:04.380,0:20:06.840
that the ritual is offered you, 
that your own in your own case

0:20:06.920,0:20:08.770
you demanded for instant money.

0:20:08.770,0:20:13.680
What were the other options that he gave you,
 and tell us more about what they involved.

0:20:14.100,0:20:19.100
As I said from the onset, there was
 the wallet money.

0:20:19.100,0:20:21.078
In the wallets money,  they 
will command money for you.

0:20:21.080,0:20:23.780
for example if you are in Nigeria they
 will command 1000 Naira for you.

0:20:23.780,0:20:25.760
That is the highest denomination, they 
will command it for you.

0:20:26.160,0:20:27.880
They you go outside there and buy something,

0:20:27.880,0:20:29.840
for example or 100 Naira out of 1000 Naira,

0:20:30.120,0:20:32.820
the Storekeeper give exchange of 900 Naira.

0:20:33.140,0:20:35.686
Now you will put the 900 naira somewhere separately

0:20:35.686,0:20:39.300
and you put the wallets that you sent 
to the spiritualist  back into your pocket.

0:20:39.780,0:20:44.560
Thirty seconds later, the thousand naira that you used in purchasing

0:20:45.040,0:20:48.960
the stuff from the shop would 
come back into your wallet.

0:20:49.220,0:20:52.080
So depending on number of shops 
you go within a day,

0:20:52.080,0:20:54.865
that will determine the amount
 of money you get within a day.

0:20:54.865,0:21:00.220
The storekeepers who trade,
 If that money mix with your money,

0:21:00.220,0:21:02.180
And you're not someone who so prayerful ,

0:21:02.180,0:21:04.660
forget it!  the maximum you can go is six month,

0:21:04.668,0:21:06.220
you can't account for your money.

0:21:07.820,0:21:11.889
The second one was the bank money.

0:21:12.050,0:21:15.190
that one, will come; you just send it to your bank.

0:21:15.920,0:21:19.280
To store it in a bank, now the bank 
will mix that money

0:21:19.280,0:21:21.400
with their money and then when you
 are going to withdraw

0:21:21.600,0:21:24.280
normally you have to wait for like three weeks

0:21:24.520,0:21:26.260
that is the kind of condition.

0:21:26.720,0:21:30.140
When you deposit the money in the bank, 
you wait for three weeks.

0:21:30.380,0:21:33.220
After three weeks you can go 
to the bank and withdraw the money.

0:21:34.100,0:21:35.940
When you go and withdraw the money,

0:21:35.940,0:21:38.420
you know banks give loans and stuff.

0:21:38.420,0:21:41.560
So they might have used your money
 to give a loan to someone

0:21:41.740,0:21:43.440
or they might have mixed it with your money.

0:21:43.440,0:21:45.320
Now you go for fresh money.

0:21:46.140,0:21:49.720
One thing I realized after I was delivered

0:21:49.870,0:21:53.741
was that these spiritualists when
 they charm the money for you,

0:21:53.741,0:21:55.989
they would never use a dime of that money

0:21:56.990,0:21:59.337
They would tell you to go and send it to bank

0:21:59.337,0:22:01.840
or go and use it after which you come and thank them.

0:22:02.260,0:22:04.300
They would never spend that money, So we have to take

0:22:04.300,0:22:06.820
the money outside and bring a fresh money to them,

0:22:07.640,0:22:09.640
before they will spend it.

0:22:11.600,0:22:16.269
So the bank will mix with your money, and then you
 also go and withdraw money from the bank.

0:22:16.269,0:22:20.540
So that different money would
 come which you can send to the ritualist to spend.

0:22:21.160,0:22:26.520
If the managerial board of the bank are not God fearing, 
people who know God,

0:22:27.980,0:22:31.299
they are going to face crisis in their business.

0:22:31.550,0:22:33.680
{So you mean to say that there are many people

0:22:33.680,0:22:35.800
right now who because they are not prayerful;

0:22:35.900,0:22:39.400
God-fearing, they're facing collapses in their business

0:22:39.400,0:22:43.100
in their in their entire lives as a result of this ritual money

0:22:43.100,0:22:46.980
that people like yourself were involving
 yourselves in before your deliverance?}

0:22:47.870,0:22:51.430
Yes, so after the first ritualist,

0:22:52.760,0:22:57.680
I was compelled to go for a different one.

0:22:57.960,0:22:59.680
But I didn't know how to get the money,

0:23:00.060,0:23:04.960
so I came home, picked my mum fridge - 
my mum stuffs

0:23:04.960,0:23:08.560
I went out there and sold them, just to get money.

0:23:08.940,0:23:13.600
So I wanted some money from my dad, 
and he told me that unless I come here

0:23:13.700,0:23:15.700
there was no way he was going
 to give me that money.

0:23:16.370,0:23:20.230
I agreed, I had an aunt who was having a leg problem

0:23:20.230,0:23:23.220
and she was also coming here, 
and I agreed to come with her.

0:23:23.620,0:23:26.180
{Now before you get to the point of coming here,

0:23:26.180,0:23:29.680
what was your impression about 
this ministry before you came here?

0:23:29.680,0:23:31.475
Did you used to watch Emmanuel TV,

0:23:31.475,0:23:34.749
or what was your reaction to 
Emmanuel TV before you came here?}

0:23:35.600,0:23:37.795
My Uncle, I have an uncle who is in Ghana,

0:23:37.800,0:23:39.640
he used to watch Emmanuel TV a lot.

0:23:40.020,0:23:41.220
So he was the I was staying with.

0:23:41.760,0:23:43.469
Each time I was on vacation and I go home,

0:23:43.469,0:23:45.340
I would make sure I create a problem.

0:23:45.920,0:23:47.900
I would create a confusion between my uncle and I

0:23:48.180,0:23:50.160
then I would be asked to move and 
go to stay with my  aunt.

0:23:50.400,0:23:53.180
When I move to my aunts place, 
she doesn't watch Emmanuel TV

0:23:53.180,0:23:54.123
so am always free there.

0:23:54.123,0:23:55.859
There were times I could cause problem

0:23:55.859,0:23:58.080
and I would be asked to go and
 stay with my grand mother.

0:23:58.080,0:24:02.189
At her place, my uncle has bought
 her satellite for her - a decoder

0:24:02.229,0:24:05.003
So she always watches Emmanuel TV; 
She's old.

0:24:05.003,0:24:07.460
So I would say okay, when she is not there

0:24:07.980,0:24:10.480
You know, when you change the channel she would be angry.

0:24:10.480,0:24:12.100
So I would go to the back of the decoder

0:24:12.100,0:24:15.060
and I would remove the cables of the decoder,

0:24:15.500,0:24:17.820
and then I would tell her the station has gone off.

0:24:18.400,0:24:20.800
And she would ask, "really?".
and I would confirm,"Yes."

0:24:20.900,0:24:22.240
And she would go and sleep.

0:24:22.740,0:24:24.500
When she goes to her room, I would fix the cable back,

0:24:24.960,0:24:26.820
and watch the channel i want to watch.

0:24:27.300,0:24:30.580
{So you hated Emanuel TV before coming here?}

0:24:31.000,0:24:35.460
Yes! I really didn't like it, Yeah.

0:24:35.940,0:24:42.060
You know, each time I watched it,
 I just felt tormented.

0:24:45.400,0:24:47.880
{Our brother is saying that he went
 to the extent that he would actually

0:24:48.620,0:24:52.620
physically go and unplug the decoder in his grandmother's

0:24:52.620,0:24:55.880
house to stop her from watching Emmanuel  TV.

0:24:55.899,0:24:57.470
So he could watch what he wanted,

0:24:57.470,0:24:59.279
because anytime he watched Emmanuel TV

0:24:59.280,0:25:01.720
he didn't feel comfortable,
 he felt something tormenting him.

0:25:02.000,0:25:06.280
So tell us what led to your actually being here in the 
Synagogue Church of all Nations?}

0:25:06.620,0:25:09.626
Before I move  to that, you know 
most of these spiritualists

0:25:09.626,0:25:13.580
I was talking about they used to 
advertise on television.

0:25:13.740,0:25:16.540
So there was a particular station that they used to advertised that was

0:25:16.540,0:25:18.180
the station that I liked watching.

0:25:18.180,0:25:19.720
So I would make my grand mother 
to go and sleep

0:25:19.860,0:25:21.700
and then I would put the channel
 so i would watch.

0:25:22.160,0:25:25.120
Then I would pick my numbers 
and my things from there.

0:25:25.500,0:25:28.940
As I was saying, I wanted some money from my dad.

0:25:29.320,0:25:31.960
It got to a time I began to extort money from people.

0:25:32.500,0:25:35.700
I would take money from people, I was into fraud,

0:25:35.900,0:25:37.080
I would fraud people and take their money.

0:25:37.389,0:25:39.988
So I wanted to take money for my
 dad to add to my money

0:25:39.988,0:25:43.240
so that I would go to a different spiritualist.

0:25:43.240,0:25:46.560
because the previous one had 
asked for blood and I blasted him

0:25:47.240,0:25:48.280
So I wanted to go for a different one.

0:25:48.400,0:25:50.940
So my dad told me that if I didn't come
 to the Synagogue Church of all Nations.

0:25:51.000,0:25:52.360
There was no way he was going to get that money.

0:25:52.400,0:25:54.460
I had an aunt who was also having a leg injury

0:25:55.040,0:25:56.960
So I decided to come with them

0:25:57.240,0:25:59.980
and when we come we would end up 
in the overflow congregation,

0:26:00.480,0:26:03.880
and the wise men would come
 around and touch her and go home.

0:26:04.260,0:26:07.300
And I would go and tell my dad that I was 
here because my aunt will testify that I was here.

0:26:07.300,0:26:09.300
So that the money I wanted would be given to me.

0:26:10.100,0:26:12.560
We went there and the foreigners were
 asked to go to go to a different room.

0:26:12.560,0:26:14.560
So that they would start sharing 
the pass to enter the auditorium.

0:26:14.980,0:26:17.840
When we went there, I swapped the pass three times

0:26:19.000,0:26:22.300
First, I saw it sharing to my raw, I left my raw

0:26:22.700,0:26:23.720
and I went to sit in a different place.

0:26:24.180,0:26:26.640
They started coming again, I left 
there and I went to sit outside.

0:26:27.600,0:26:30.020
I was sitting outside, and then
 they came there again.

0:26:30.180,0:26:34.240
I was running away and the 
guy place the pass into my hand.

0:26:34.800,0:26:38.680
Because my aunties were watching
 me; they were suspecting something.

0:26:38.680,0:26:40.000
so I just followed them.

0:26:40.360,0:26:43.200
We came and sat among the 
congregation at the back there.

0:26:43.840,0:26:48.560
I thought that my aunt will be touched and she would go

0:26:48.560,0:26:49.980
and I would go and get my money

0:26:50.240,0:26:52.580
When I was sitting there I wasn't 
concentrating with what was happening here.

0:26:53.000,0:26:55.880
I was just thinking how I was going to get the money

0:26:55.880,0:26:57.420
and do my stuff at home.

0:26:57.740,0:26:59.740
So I was sitting there and it was testimony time.

0:27:00.020,0:27:05.060
And I saw a friend of mine here giving
 testimony about this same problem.

0:27:05.620,0:27:08.340
I was sited there and I thought,
 "Jesus Christ, this guy has been caught,

0:27:08.950,0:27:10.367
I will be the next victim."

0:27:10.367,0:27:12.929
So I had to run away because I was not safe.

0:27:14.139,0:27:16.139
{So you mean the brother that gave his testimony

0:27:16.240,0:27:18.920
last week about being delivered 
from the spirit of stealing

0:27:18.920,0:27:21.500
you knew him personally that 
you were both involved act.}

0:27:21.660,0:27:23.900
Yes, I knew you personally.

0:27:24.440,0:27:26.580
I tried going out,

0:27:27.440,0:27:29.740
but then the ushers at the entrance
 couldn't allow me to go out.

0:27:30.480,0:27:32.800
I told them that I want to go and
 urinate but they refused.

0:27:33.740,0:27:36.680
So I came back and sat down,
 I was sitting down when the man of God

0:27:36.680,0:27:37.560
entered the auditorium.

0:27:37.800,0:27:40.200
Immediately he entered the auditorium
 I started sweating,

0:27:40.860,0:27:42.360
I was feeling headache,

0:27:42.640,0:27:44.613
I said I was going out, the usher told me

0:27:44.613,0:27:46.153
since the man of God was inside there was no way

0:27:46.160,0:27:47.500
they were going to allow me to go out.

0:27:47.780,0:27:49.300
I asked, "What kind of nonsense was that?

0:27:49.580,0:27:51.700
I came in myself and I want to go out
 and you are telling me not to go out?"

0:27:52.260,0:27:54.740
I really pushed but they didn't allow me to go out.

0:27:55.160,0:27:59.040
So I came and sit down, Each time the man of God

0:27:59.040,0:28:01.080
came that way, I bend down my face.

0:28:01.760,0:28:03.940
When the man of God was on stage, 
there was a man of war was on stage

0:28:03.940,0:28:05.559
It was a man who stood up.

0:28:05.559,0:28:07.265
And then the man of God delivered him,

0:28:07.265,0:28:08.640
he was from my lane.

0:28:09.020,0:28:11.540
When he stood up, I thought, "what 
kind of nonsense is this?"

0:28:11.540,0:28:13.760
Wont you see you made this man 
to come to this area and I will be caught.

0:28:14.260,0:28:16.940
In fact when I was sitting down,
 I knew mine has some.

0:28:17.460,0:28:18.900
So I needed way to run away.

0:28:19.160,0:28:22.840
So I said, what nonsense is
 this wont you sit down, I will be caught.

0:28:22.840,0:28:28.140
I was praying saying, "I pray this 
man of God wont come here."

0:28:29.240,0:28:32.100
Fortunately or unfortunately for me, 
he didn't come to the other lane.

0:28:32.520,0:28:37.240
He was at the other lane 
and he left, I said, "Thank God."

0:28:39.100,0:28:42.920
The wise men started going round it was prayer time.

0:28:43.420,0:28:45.720
They touched my aunt, she was not close to me

0:28:45.720,0:28:48.540
She was at the far end and I was in a different place.

0:28:48.940,0:28:51.800
They touched her, I thanked
 God they have touched her.

0:28:52.300,0:28:54.000
So I was coming to move from 
where I was sitting

0:28:54.000,0:28:56.460
and go and mix with the people
 they have already touched.

0:28:56.980,0:28:59.060
So that they wont touch me, since my aunt has

0:28:59.060,0:29:00.280
been touched, you would think I 
wont be touched.

0:29:01.900,0:29:07.439
There were three lanes to the
 place that I was sitting, I felt slaps.

0:29:09.010,0:29:12.420
I felt three strong slaps.

0:29:13.120,0:29:18.900
There were three guys before me  at the far end.

0:29:18.900,0:29:20.420
I was seeing him as a human being

0:29:20.890,0:29:23.699
but then when he got closer to 
me, I was seeing fire

0:29:25.420,0:29:30.719
I wanted to run away, but the guys had hold 
me so stiff that I couldn't run away.

0:29:31.450,0:29:35.380
I realized that I was on the floor, 
and I was asked to rise up.

0:29:37.290,0:29:39.290
{Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ

0:29:42.340,0:29:44.916
So brother just just describe again as the wise man

0:29:44.916,0:29:47.189
approached you were trying to leave the place.

0:29:47.190,0:29:48.991
You said you felt something slap you.

0:29:48.991,0:29:51.570
Just describe exactly what happened at that moment.}

0:29:52.180,0:29:54.329
I felt a slap from behind.

0:29:55.210,0:29:57.630
I turned like this and another one came.

0:30:00.100,0:30:03.390
I was wondering because I have been through prayers.

0:30:03.900,0:30:06.200
My parent have taken me through pastors.

0:30:07.040,0:30:08.838
I would go there with a problem, the next thing they

0:30:08.838,0:30:10.360
would tell me I was coming to travel abroad.

0:30:10.680,0:30:13.820
I should go and bring money.

0:30:14.640,0:30:18.060
I would feel happy that I was traveling abroad, 
so I would go and bring the money.

0:30:18.300,0:30:23.040
But I realized since I came, sitting 
down there and I started feeling slaps.

0:30:23.660,0:30:26.320
I thought, "This place wasn't safe for me, 
I thought it was, so I had to go."

0:30:28.540,0:30:33.740
All the ways that I was trying to escape was not helping.

0:30:34.320,0:30:36.960
The ushers were on my neck.

0:30:37.680,0:30:39.680
They just didn't want me to go out.

0:30:40.300,0:30:45.340
So when the wise man came 
closer another slap came.

0:30:46.100,0:30:48.420
I thought, "whoa, today I have been caught."

0:30:48.700,0:30:50.700
I told myself, the end has come!

0:30:50.840,0:30:55.880
Because If my friend was standing here
 testifying, my end has come.

0:30:56.380,0:30:58.840
I just saw fire.

0:30:59.920,0:31:03.700
The fire was so intense.

0:31:04.640,0:31:08.200
that I tried running away ,
 but the ushers held me so tight.

0:31:09.300,0:31:10.640
I couldn't do anything.

0:31:10.960,0:31:13.520
Then I realized I was on the floor, 
and I was asked to rise up.

0:31:14.440,0:31:17.549
{One more time people of God, 
let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:31:20.680,0:31:22.980
So brother it has been one week now since

0:31:23.080,0:31:25.351
Your deliverance by the grace of God you've been here in

0:31:25.351,0:31:28.230
the Synagogue Church of all Nations
 and spending time in God's presence.

0:31:28.330,0:31:31.124
Just tell us what is the transformation in your life

0:31:31.124,0:31:32.789
ever since your deliverance?}

0:31:33.730,0:31:36.971
Last week since I have been here, 
I've not been on any alcohol.

0:31:36.971,0:31:38.309
I've not been on any drug.

0:31:38.309,0:31:43.900
I feel revealed, all the thoughts I was
 having in my head; they are all gone.

0:31:45.180,0:31:48.280
{let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ

0:31:50.880,0:31:52.880
So right now as you're standing here

0:31:53.320,0:31:56.220
What can you say about going to ritualist

0:31:56.220,0:31:59.840
getting money - quick money;
 instant money through demonic means?

0:31:59.840,0:32:01.140
I mean now you're standing here,

0:32:01.140,0:32:03.680
you've been delivered what do
 you want to say about such issues?}

0:32:04.200,0:32:06.340
You know in life,

0:32:06.680,0:32:08.540
we all have different track race,

0:32:08.540,0:32:10.180
we didn't start at the same time.

0:32:10.180,0:32:13.620
Let's say, someone probably may 
have committed series of abortion,

0:32:13.920,0:32:17.420
but immediately she gets married
 she gets pregnant instantly.

0:32:17.920,0:32:21.620
But a virgin also waits centuries
 after she would give birth.

0:32:23.540,0:32:27.440
Someone who completes university at the age of 20

0:32:27.440,0:32:30.860
and she has to wait home for like five
 years before he gets employment.

0:32:31.420,0:32:34.600
Someone who also completes at age
 25 immediately get employment.

0:32:35.220,0:32:38.820
I've realized that we all don't have the same track

0:32:39.100,0:32:41.240
and our finish like are not the same.

0:32:41.720,0:32:45.260
Now with this devilish thing the 
devil will never give you something

0:32:45.260,0:32:46.820
without taking something back from you.

0:32:46.990,0:32:50.579
If he doesn't take it in kind, he is
 going to take it physically.

0:32:51.460,0:32:56.740
Its either your  your money 
your child or something that you cherish.

0:32:56.740,0:32:58.710
And mostly when they are coming, they come for something you cherish most.

0:32:59.140,0:33:00.680
That is what I realized.

0:33:01.160,0:33:06.160
because they realized let's say.
 I like kids; I was playing with kids,

0:33:06.180,0:33:09.380
I like helping people, they would ask me to give money

0:33:09.380,0:33:11.940
out of the money they would
 charm for me to virgins - which are kids

0:33:12.060,0:33:13.920
So eventually like playing with kids,

0:33:13.920,0:33:19.980
they will use those kids that I like playing 
with as a source to kind of to satisfy their gods.

0:33:21.120,0:33:24.640
I realized also in life although you might

0:33:24.640,0:33:26.940
be going through challenge, the ups and downs in life,

0:33:27.340,0:33:29.060
It is not the end.

0:33:29.060,0:33:32.920
The devil will give you something to sustain you,

0:33:32.920,0:33:35.260
but he would never give you a solution.

0:33:35.700,0:33:38.220
It's only the Lord Jesus Christ that 
can give you the final solution

0:33:38.460,0:33:43.360
that can release you from all your entangles,
 that can release you from your case.

0:33:46.620,0:33:49.060
Its only the Lord Jesus Christ 
that can help you.

0:33:49.280,0:33:52.160
With this Emmanuel TV and the anointing water and the anointed sticker,

0:33:52.168,0:33:53.069
It is real.

0:33:53.620,0:33:59.700
First, I was a critic, my people would be using it and I would tell them not to use it.

0:34:00.560,0:34:04.160
There were times I could go to 
church and intentionally fall

0:34:04.260,0:34:06.080
for the people around me to think that I am delivered

0:34:06.200,0:34:08.260
so that when I go to ask for money they would give me.

0:34:08.680,0:34:11.540
So when they touch me, I would pretend and fall

0:34:11.580,0:34:12.900
but here I wasn't touched,

0:34:13.600,0:34:16.799
In fact I wasn't touched, I just fall
 I don't know what happened.

0:34:17.040,0:34:19.900
So there is God here, so if you
 come here,

0:34:19.900,0:34:21.440
believing there is God here,

0:34:21.440,0:34:23.480
trust me  you are going to be
 delivered in Jesus name.

0:34:24.040,0:34:26.580
{Amen,  let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ

0:34:26.580,0:34:28.320
for our brothers wonderful deliverance.

0:34:28.810,0:34:31.200
So just a final question for our brother
 now

0:34:31.200,0:34:33.239
that Jesus Christ has delivered you.

0:34:33.280,0:34:35.687
What do you want to say to people outside

0:34:35.687,0:34:39.269
there who are still involving themselves
 in money rituals,

0:34:39.730,0:34:43.650
and visiting spiritualists, witch doctors, herbalist,
 what do you want to say to them?}

0:34:44.160,0:34:46.180
My advice to this people is,

0:34:46.180,0:34:47.360
now that I have been delivered,

0:34:47.360,0:34:49.640
I hope the Lord Jesus Christ has delivered

0:34:49.820,0:34:52.760
all those girls that I used to give money to

0:34:52.760,0:34:55.040
out of the hands of the devil.

0:34:55.660,0:35:01.980
My advice first  goes to parent out there,  
if someone start giving your kid money,

0:35:02.900,0:35:08.710
you should question where the 
person is getting the money from.

0:35:09.440,0:35:11.440
Secondly goes through women out there

0:35:11.780,0:35:14.560
Please when you have your menstruation

0:35:15.140,0:35:19.780
please dig a hole or find a way
 of disposing your menstrual pads.

0:35:20.180,0:35:23.060
And then also to my friends out there

0:35:23.200,0:35:27.200
To the big men and the big guys that  I met,

0:35:27.380,0:35:28.660
I know some of them might be watching me

0:35:29.160,0:35:32.340
I met them when I was going to

0:35:32.600,0:35:36.820
the spiritualist for my help,
 they should all come to Jesus Christ.

0:35:37.220,0:35:41.180
Because there is no final solution
 than in the house of the Lord.

0:35:41.180,0:35:44.460
Because yes we've tried it and I have moved steps

0:35:45.000,0:35:48.680
but then I've realized that with all this spiritualists,

0:35:48.680,0:35:49.700
they all have their rules.

0:35:50.360,0:35:52.240
There rules are never the same.

0:35:52.240,0:35:55.540
But I have realized with our Jesus Christ His rule is one.

0:35:55.540,0:35:57.260
The bible is only one.

0:35:58.060,0:35:59.500
There is no bible that is going to come after

0:35:59.580,0:36:01.480
and there is no bible that came before.

0:36:02.260,0:36:04.800
But then with all these spiritualist, they all  use

0:36:04.800,0:36:06.940
different books and they all have their rules.

0:36:07.130,0:36:10.960
So we should all stick to one rule. 
Which is the rule of our Lord Jesus Christ

0:36:11.030,0:36:15.580
They should all come for deliverance, 
and I hope that the Lord Jesus Christ

0:36:15.580,0:36:19.569
who delivered me out of this bondage
 would take them all out in Jesus name.

0:36:20.300,0:36:22.359
{Amen, lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ

0:36:23.600,0:36:27.399
So I hope we understood what our 
brother said there, now that he is delivered

0:36:27.400,0:36:31.200
he knows that all of those virgin 
girls that was giving money to.

0:36:31.200,0:36:34.360
And as a result of that would lose 
their menstruation

0:36:34.550,0:36:36.840
And would never be able to have a child,

0:36:36.840,0:36:41.019
he says that they too are delivered and 
all the people who have touched this

0:36:41.600,0:36:44.679
ritual money that he was involved in through his deliverance

0:36:44.680,0:36:47.520
God has touched them and delivered them as well.

0:36:47.880,0:36:50.420
And finally brother you said that 
you've been involved in this from

0:36:50.420,0:36:52.240
the age of eight. How old are you right now?

0:36:52.550,0:36:54.939
I'm 20 years old.

0:36:55.180,0:36:57.880
So you can just imagine how at
 this young age of our brother,

0:36:57.880,0:37:01.680
satan has really been using him, 
but we thank Jesus Christ that today.

0:37:01.850,0:37:06.029
He is delivered and we give all the
 glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:37:06.030,0:37:08.609
We pray that God will give you the 
grace to maintain this deliverance

0:37:08.770,0:37:13.109
so that what you've received will stand
 the test of time in Jesus name.

0:37:13.990,0:37:18.389
