This is wiseman Harry

0:00:01.880,0:00:06.260
moving in the midst of those who have come to the Synagogue Church of all Nations

0:00:06.260,0:00:09.620
in search of Divine intervention to bring solution,

0:00:09.620,0:00:12.860
deliverance and all of God's 
blessings to their life.

0:00:12.860,0:00:16.600
The power of God works in 
the Spirit setting captives free.

0:00:16.600,0:00:19.480
What you are watching is the reality

0:00:19.480,0:00:22.600
that Jesus Christ lives, He never said goodbye.

0:00:22.600,0:00:26.480
And He has made a way for us to be separated

0:00:26.480,0:00:30.600
from the darkness behind every 
adversity in life.

0:00:30.600,0:00:33.820
Let's watch as all the shades of darkness are dispelled

0:00:33.820,0:00:35.720
from this young man's life in the 
mighty

0:00:35.720,0:00:40.340
name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

0:00:40.340,0:00:42.540
Who are you?

0:00:42.540,0:00:43.040
Huh?

0:00:43.040,0:00:44.000
Why do you want to know?

0:00:44.000,0:00:45.220
What have you done to him?

0:00:45.220,0:00:46.820
I have destroyed his education.

0:00:46.820,0:00:47.840
Who are you inside of him?

0:00:47.840,0:00:49.360
I am an idol.

0:00:49.360,0:00:50.680
You are an idol.

0:00:50.680,0:00:53.700
What have you done to his family?

0:00:53.700,0:00:55.420
There is no prosperity in his family.

0:00:55.420,0:00:57.900
Who removed the prosperity?

0:00:57.900,0:00:59.080
I am the one.

0:00:59.080,0:01:00.160
You are the one.

0:01:00.160,0:01:02.640
Why did you destroy his education?

0:01:02.640,0:01:06.200
He is at the university,
I made him drink alcohol.

0:01:06.200,0:01:09.900
I make him drink, he can take a
 packet of cigarettes in 30 minutes.

0:01:09.900,0:01:10.920
Within 30 minutes?

0:01:10.920,0:01:11.700
Yes.

0:01:11.700,0:01:12.620
Three packets?

0:01:12.620,0:01:13.400
Yes!

0:01:13.400,0:01:17.200
Why did you make that to him?

0:01:17.200,0:01:18.580
That makes me happy.

0:01:18.580,0:01:19.200
That makes you happy?

0:01:19.200,0:01:20.400
Yes!

0:01:20.400,0:01:23.980
Okay, how do you normally operate in his life?

0:01:23.980,0:01:25.000
I operate through dreams.

0:01:25.000,0:01:25.820
Through dreams?

0:01:25.820,0:01:26.400
Yes.

0:01:26.400,0:01:27.500
How?

0:01:27.500,0:01:30.720
I sleep with him in dreams.

0:01:30.720,0:01:32.640
Out! In the name of Jesus.

0:01:32.640,0:01:44.460
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:44.460,0:01:51.520
In Jesus' name.

0:01:51.520,0:01:53.620
In Jesus' name, thank you Lord!

0:01:53.620,0:01:58.160
You are free in the name of Jesus.

0:01:58.160,0:01:59.300
How are you?

0:01:59.300,0:02:00.240
I am good.

0:02:00.240,0:02:00.920
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:02:00.920,0:02:02.520
So Jesus Christ has delivered you.

0:02:02.520,0:02:03.420
Thank you, Jesus, I'm free.

0:02:03.420,0:02:08.360
You are free!

0:02:08.360,0:02:11.380
I am Mr Jesse Delali.
I'm from Ghana.

0:02:11.380,0:02:16.900
My testimony goes like this. 
I've lived 21 years of my life for the devil.

0:02:16.900,0:02:21.400
This whole thing started when I was
 8 years old,

0:02:21.400,0:02:25.280
I was taken to my grandmother's
hometown for a funeral

0:02:25.280,0:02:29.120
after which I saw the way my 
people were worshipping idols.

0:02:29.120,0:02:31.915
So I was kind of enticed and got interested in it.

0:02:31.920,0:02:35.060
So I got closer to that place and then

0:02:35.060,0:02:38.600
looked at the way they were 
kind of performing the rituals.

0:02:38.600,0:02:42.500
After that, that day I went home, 
and then I just developed

0:02:42.500,0:02:44.340
a habit of stealing.

0:02:44.340,0:02:45.640
Okay, before you go ahead,

0:02:45.640,0:02:47.979
can you just tell us the home you brought up in

0:02:47.980,0:02:50.180
and the type of background you are from?

0:02:50.180,0:02:54.960
I was brought up from a very strict Christian home.

0:02:54.960,0:02:57.060
My dad was very strict and academician

0:02:57.060,0:03:00.440
and my mum was also very prayerful.

0:03:00.440,0:03:01.700
Yeah, that was the kind of home I was brought up in.

0:03:01.700,0:03:03.440
So you're brought up in a strict Christian home

0:03:03.440,0:03:05.019
but when you were eight years old

0:03:05.020,0:03:08.080
you went to the village for a funeral.

0:03:08.080,0:03:09.800
And tell us exactly what happened,

0:03:09.800,0:03:12.100
when you went to that funeral. 
What did you see there?

0:03:12.100,0:03:18.520
When I went for the funeral, I 
realized that my dad's home, his family -

0:03:18.520,0:03:20.720
they were idol worshippers.

0:03:20.720,0:03:25.740
So they would use their mouth to 
bite the head of a live chicken.

0:03:25.740,0:03:27.380
So I got interested in it

0:03:27.380,0:03:30.880
and I got closer to see how 
they were performing their rituals.

0:03:30.880,0:03:33.980
So as a small boy, you were just 
watching closely as they were performing

0:03:33.980,0:03:37.100
this ritual and then what happened to you?

0:03:37.100,0:03:40.874
From that day, I came home and then I just developed

0:03:40.880,0:03:46.120
the habit of picking stuffs from the house.

0:03:46.120,0:03:49.740
So from that age of eight as
you returned from this funeral

0:03:49.740,0:03:51.360
you began to steal?

0:03:51.360,0:03:52.100
Yeah.

0:03:52.100,0:03:54.580
Okay, can you just tell us more
 about how this developed

0:03:54.580,0:03:59.460
and how serious this spirit 
of stealing became?

0:03:59.460,0:04:04.400
This thing developed from 
stage to stage as a young guy.

0:04:04.400,0:04:07.600
I could go into my parents
 room and steal their money.

0:04:07.600,0:04:10.820
It got to a time, because of
 this stealing habits,

0:04:10.820,0:04:12.620
I took it from home to outside.

0:04:12.620,0:04:14.980
I started taking things from my friends.

0:04:14.980,0:04:18.900
I easily made friends - when I 
got to a place I would make friends.

0:04:18.900,0:04:21.000
I ended up taking stuff from them.

0:04:21.000,0:04:27.420
Because of this thing, I was expelled
 from about two junior high schools

0:04:27.420,0:04:29.100
before I went to senior high school.

0:04:29.100,0:04:32.420
And when I went to senior high school,
 I was still in this mess.

0:04:32.420,0:04:38.620
I went to the university and I met friends
 who were spending money.

0:04:38.620,0:04:42.100
So I asked them how they 
made their money.

0:04:42.100,0:04:45.180
So before you go to that level, tell us for example

0:04:45.180,0:04:47.360
the type of things you would steal and how

0:04:47.360,0:04:49.060
you would go about stealing those items

0:04:49.060,0:04:53.000
anytime that spirit of stealing came into you?

0:04:53.000,0:04:56.480
I would steal money - money was the thing

0:04:56.480,0:04:58.100
I would steal most of the time.

0:04:58.100,0:05:03.080
I would enter room; I won't be
 there when they hide the money.

0:05:03.080,0:05:09.760
But I could enter the room, sit down
 and I could smell the money in that room.

0:05:09.760,0:05:12.160
I needed the money, I would close my eyes

0:05:12.160,0:05:13.615
for two minutes and open my eyes.

0:05:13.620,0:05:16.100
I would just move straight to
 where the money was kept.

0:05:16.100,0:05:18.760
And l would just pick it.

0:05:18.760,0:05:22.520
So even if that money is hidden in a very secret place,

0:05:22.520,0:05:25.400
once you entered the room and 
closed your eyes -

0:05:25.400,0:05:29.160
a spirit would push you to 
know where that money is located?

0:05:29.160,0:05:30.280
Yeah.

0:05:30.280,0:05:34.700
How much money were you 
stealing on a regular basis?

0:05:34.700,0:05:37.820
I was stealing thousands of dollars.

0:05:37.820,0:05:40.980
I was stealing money, I was into 
stealing money from my home.

0:05:40.980,0:05:42.440
And what were you using this 
money to do,

0:05:42.440,0:05:44.700
what were you using this money for?

0:05:44.700,0:05:46.660
I would go and buy good stuff for myself,

0:05:46.660,0:05:51.780
I would buy shoes and shirts.

0:05:51.780,0:05:53.520
Okay, so we are hearing from our brother

0:05:53.520,0:05:55.660
he is explaining how from the age of 8,

0:05:55.660,0:05:58.880
he began to develop a habit of stealing after

0:05:58.880,0:06:01.140
he went to funeral where he witnessed

0:06:01.140,0:06:05.260
idol worship and a specific ritual being performed.

0:06:05.260,0:06:09.580
And he said, anytime he used to go
 into a room to steal,

0:06:09.580,0:06:11.800
a spirit would communicate to him

0:06:11.800,0:06:15.120
where that money was located and he would be able to steal.

0:06:15.120,0:06:17.380
He has stolen thousands of dollars,

0:06:17.380,0:06:20.320
and he would just use this money to live a very lavish

0:06:20.320,0:06:22.700
lifestyle - flamboyant lifestyle.

0:06:22.700,0:06:25.920
So tell us, as you got older, how did this develop

0:06:25.920,0:06:28.480
and become even more serious?

0:06:28.480,0:06:31.180
This became serious when I got to university;

0:06:31.180,0:06:35.100
when I got to university, I met friends who were spending money,

0:06:35.100,0:06:37.980
they were living kind of big life.

0:06:37.980,0:06:40.660
So with the kind of money that I was 
getting from home was not enough,

0:06:40.660,0:06:43.460
since my dad was very strict;
he started restricting me.

0:06:43.460,0:06:47.800
So I asked them how they made their money,

0:06:47.800,0:06:52.000
and then I was introduced to how they got their money.

0:06:52.000,0:06:55.480
Initially they did not want to tell me,
 but upon several pressurization

0:06:55.480,0:06:57.600
I was introduced to how they made their money;

0:06:57.600,0:07:01.880
which I also got enticed into it,
and I started getting my money.

0:07:01.880,0:07:06.220
It involved spiritualist.

0:07:06.220,0:07:09.520
Firstly, and I was given a spiritualist number

0:07:09.520,0:07:12.800
that I called on phone, and I told
 him I needed money.

0:07:12.800,0:07:16.400
So he gave me some options which I chose one

0:07:16.400,0:07:19.280
out of the numerous options 
he gave me.

0:07:19.280,0:07:20.880
Which I went in for.

0:07:20.880,0:07:26.200
He gave me several options. Some of the options were like

0:07:26.200,0:07:38.380
'wallet money', 'instant money', 'god's money', 'bank's money' and 'do as I say'.

0:07:38.380,0:07:44.580
With the 'wallet money' for instance, in my country,

0:07:44.580,0:07:48.080
the biggest currency we use is 50 Ghana cedis.

0:07:48.080,0:07:55.580
Now you would send an empty
 wallet to the spiritualist.

0:07:55.580,0:07:57.520
When you send the wallet to him,

0:07:57.520,0:08:00.300
he will command the 50 cedis into your wallet.

0:08:00.300,0:08:02.600
That 50 cedis you can use to buy a car,

0:08:02.600,0:08:06.080
you can use to buy a house, 
you can use to buy anything you want to.

0:08:06.080,0:08:08.200
It works this way.

0:08:08.200,0:08:12.900
You go out there and use the 50 cedis
 to purchase something from a store.

0:08:12.900,0:08:14.910
Now, when you use that money to 
buy something from the store -

0:08:14.910,0:08:17.200
let's say you buy something like 5 Cedis out of it -

0:08:17.200,0:08:18.980
and change will be given to you.

0:08:18.980,0:08:20.660
When that change is given to you,

0:08:20.660,0:08:23.280
you'll keep that change separately from where the wallet is.

0:08:23.280,0:08:25.600
You put your wallet back into your pocket.

0:08:25.600,0:08:28.240
30 seconds after the money you 
used to purchase

0:08:28.240,0:08:29.638
something from the store,

0:08:29.640,0:08:32.580
the money would come back into your wallet.

0:08:32.580,0:08:35.100
So depending on the number 
of stores you go within a day,

0:08:35.100,0:08:40.000
that will determine the amount 
of money you get within day.

0:08:40.000,0:08:43.260
Brethren, if you are not a good Christian 
or someone who prays,

0:08:43.260,0:08:44.766
and that money will mix with your money...

0:08:44.766,0:08:47.300
Let's say you are a trader, and if
 that money mixes with your money -

0:08:47.300,0:08:49.280
within six months your money will go to the drain,

0:08:49.280,0:08:52.620
and you won't be able to account for anything.

0:08:52.620,0:08:54.580
That was the first option.

0:08:54.580,0:08:57.600
Okay, now before going ahead 
when you went to

0:08:57.600,0:09:01.360
this spiritualist to involve yourself 
and these money rituals -

0:09:01.360,0:09:05.177
what were the conditions laid down,
 what were the things he asked you to bring

0:09:05.177,0:09:07.120
and the conditions that were laid down

0:09:07.120,0:09:12.220
before he went ahead to do 
these specific money rituals?

0:09:12.220,0:09:13.800
When you call them on phone,

0:09:13.800,0:09:17.560
initially, they will tell you: "No blood" - 
they don't need blood from you.

0:09:17.560,0:09:20.340
So when you go to them, they would ask you

0:09:20.340,0:09:22.340
to bring an amount of money

0:09:22.340,0:09:27.120
which you will use to go and buy 
some stuff from the market.

0:09:27.120,0:09:29.800
And he would tell you that he
 was going to call your star.

0:09:29.800,0:09:35.900
If your star responds, that will determine
 the amount of money they are going to get.

0:09:35.900,0:09:39.780
First, I was asked to bring an
 amount of money which I sent

0:09:39.780,0:09:43.980
and they used it to buy certain 
things from the market.

0:09:43.980,0:09:47.000
And then he called my star,
 my star came,

0:09:47.000,0:09:51.300
and then he asked me the
 amount of money that I wanted.

0:09:51.300,0:09:58.100
My amount options was actually 'instant money'.

0:09:58.100,0:10:02.300
So he poured powder in my hand and
 asked me how much money I needed.

0:10:02.300,0:10:04.280
And I mentioned the amount that I needed.

0:10:04.280,0:10:07.980
Then he did some things for about 20 minutes

0:10:07.980,0:10:10.760
and he opened a box and the
 money was in the box.

0:10:10.760,0:10:14.140
The exact amount I was looking 
for was in the box.

0:10:14.140,0:10:19.400
So, I took it to campus and started spending it.

0:10:19.400,0:10:22.324
It got to a time I flattered the whole office,

0:10:22.324,0:10:26.200
and then he asked me to bring human blood.

0:10:26.200,0:10:30.700
I told him that I wasn't doing  it, 
in fact I called him on phone and insulted him.

0:10:30.700,0:10:33.660
And then I moved to a different spiritualist.

0:10:33.660,0:10:36.260
So you said that initially they told you that

0:10:36.260,0:10:38.580
you would not require blood.

0:10:38.580,0:10:42.960
But once you had used this ritual
 and obtained instant money,

0:10:42.960,0:10:48.460
when you now return to that spiritualist 
to get more, he demanded for blood?

0:10:48.460,0:10:49.900
Yeah.

0:10:49.900,0:10:53.480
Okay, now tell us what was the amount that you

0:10:53.480,0:10:54.793
collected through this instant money?

0:10:54.800,0:10:56.780
And once again, what were the conditions attached?

0:10:56.780,0:10:58.200
How you would use this money,

0:10:58.200,0:11:01.000
and the things you could not use this money to do?

0:11:01.000,0:11:02.420
You know for the first person,

0:11:02.420,0:11:06.100
when the money comes, you would
 go and deposit the money in a bank.

0:11:06.100,0:11:07.735
After which you will go and withdraw part of

0:11:07.740,0:11:09.540
the money and come give to him.

0:11:09.540,0:11:13.580
So for the second person, I went to him

0:11:13.580,0:11:15.820
and he also gave me his options.

0:11:15.820,0:11:17.480
And then I chose what I wanted.

0:11:17.480,0:11:18.920
He said that when the money comes,

0:11:18.920,0:11:23.320
I have to give 30 cedis out of it
 to three virgins -

0:11:23.320,0:11:30.000
kids who are growing up, 
before spending your money.

0:11:30.000,0:11:34.220
For them, virtually they will never
 give birth in their entire life again.

0:11:34.220,0:11:36.600
I hope we understand what our brother just said.

0:11:36.600,0:11:38.702
So the condition attached was that you

0:11:38.702,0:11:42.380
had to give some of this money to three virgins.

0:11:42.380,0:11:46.760
And what would happen to those 
girls once you gave them the money?

0:11:46.760,0:11:48.980
When I give them the money,
 and they spend their money,

0:11:48.980,0:11:53.100
they will never give birth in the entire life.

0:11:53.100,0:11:56.820
Yes, I know most of my friends
 were also engaged in all this.

0:11:56.820,0:11:59.200
He told me that it was my star that wanted

0:11:59.200,0:12:01.500
to give the money for the virgins.

0:12:01.500,0:12:03.740
Most of my friends that were also in this,

0:12:03.740,0:12:06.700
had their rules and what they had to do.

0:12:06.700,0:12:09.380
My friend for instance - his rule was,

0:12:09.380,0:12:15.400
when women have the menstruation 
and then they throw their pads outside,

0:12:15.400,0:12:18.480
he pays people to go and pick them
 and bring it to him

0:12:18.480,0:12:21.560
and then he will take you to the 
ritualist for his star cleansing.

0:12:21.560,0:12:25.900
When a woman pad gets in there, 
she will never give birth again.

0:12:25.900,0:12:29.740
There was no way she was going
 to give birth in her entire life again.

0:12:29.740,0:12:32.760
Okay, so what our brother is 
saying is that the spiritualist

0:12:32.760,0:12:36.540
would give different conditions 
according to the person that came to

0:12:36.540,0:12:38.140
him before doing the money rituals.

0:12:38.140,0:12:41.360
In the case of our brother, when he
 was given this instant money,

0:12:41.360,0:12:43.960
the condition was - he had to give a certain amount of

0:12:43.960,0:12:47.200
this money to three virgin girls.

0:12:47.200,0:12:49.973
And whoever collected that 
money, once they spent it -

0:12:49.980,0:12:53.420
they would never be able to
 give birth again in their life.

0:12:53.420,0:12:56.520
And other friends of his had conditions whereby.

0:12:56.520,0:12:59.400
If a woman dropped her menstruation pads somewhere

0:12:59.400,0:13:01.100
in a public place or on the floor,

0:13:01.100,0:13:04.120
he would pay someone to collect 
those menstruation pads,

0:13:04.120,0:13:07.620
bring it to the ritualist and from that point forward

0:13:07.620,0:13:09.736
the person who dropped their menstruation pad

0:13:09.736,0:13:12.400
would never be able to have a child in their life.

0:13:12.400,0:13:14.600
So continue, brother. Tell us more about

0:13:14.600,0:13:16.700
your activities with these ritualists.

0:13:16.700,0:13:21.000
When I went with this to ritualists, they gave me options.

0:13:21.000,0:13:26.900
In Ghana we have people who run micro finances, savings and loan companies.

0:13:26.900,0:13:30.100
Most of the serving and loan companies that I knew

0:13:30.100,0:13:31.600
were also into this.

0:13:31.600,0:13:33.620
They also had their option, now they would go

0:13:33.620,0:13:36.800
for money from this people, then come to give as loan.

0:13:36.800,0:13:41.260
If you have a company or an asset and
 you use it as a collateral to take that money

0:13:41.260,0:13:43.740
and you are not prayerful, forget it!

0:13:43.740,0:13:46.700
That asset that you used as
 a collateral become a liability.

0:13:46.700,0:13:48.980
There was no way you could pay
 that money back.

0:13:48.980,0:13:55.380
So then eventually your assets become theirs.

0:13:55.380,0:13:57.720
So just to explain more about how you

0:13:57.720,0:14:00.620
would do this spiritual transaction with the bank

0:14:00.620,0:14:02.200
to deceive people to do a loan.

0:14:02.200,0:14:05.900
Just explained very clearly to 
people how you would go about it.

0:14:05.900,0:14:09.240
With a bank issue, they would charm

0:14:09.240,0:14:10.680
the money for you.

0:14:10.680,0:14:14.500
Let me talk about the savings and loan aspect.

0:14:14.500,0:14:16.360
Now you go to him for a loan.

0:14:16.360,0:14:20.460
He would take your assets,
 something valuable that would be

0:14:20.460,0:14:23.420
more than the money you are taking as a collateral.

0:14:23.420,0:14:25.800
And then he will give you the money you want.

0:14:25.800,0:14:28.320
Now, if you are a good Christian, someone who prays,

0:14:28.320,0:14:31.080
forget! There was no way you could pay the money back.

0:14:31.080,0:14:35.080
So then what you used as a 
collateral will eventually becomes his

0:14:35.080,0:14:37.240
because you can't pay the money back.

0:14:37.240,0:14:42.700
When this money comes, you 
will be asked to deposit it in a bank.

0:14:42.709,0:14:44.890
When you deposit the money into the bank,

0:14:44.890,0:14:47.600
the bank will mix it with your money,

0:14:47.600,0:14:52.240
and then you go for a fresh money, 
and if, let's say, the owner of the bank,

0:14:52.240,0:14:54.760
the managerial part of the bank are not prayerful,

0:14:54.760,0:14:58.020
they would  face crisis in their banking business

0:14:58.020,0:15:00.860
because their money is going to go in a drain.

0:15:00.860,0:15:03.400
Because what I was made to know -

0:15:03.400,0:15:10.220
the spirit that gave the money, was from the sea.

0:15:10.220,0:15:14.140
So when they come out there,
 mix their money with our money,

0:15:14.140,0:15:16.351
then they drain the money back 
to the sea.

0:15:16.351,0:15:19.640
So they keep it there so when 
someone goes to them for money,

0:15:19.640,0:15:21.800
they can get the money and 
give to the person.

0:15:21.800,0:15:24.035
So when these money started coming up,

0:15:24.035,0:15:27.600
I started drinking, smoking, I was on drugs,

0:15:27.600,0:15:32.020
womanizing, clubbing, all sort of ungodly things.

0:15:32.020,0:15:37.480
First academically l was good, but when
 I started involving myself in this situation

0:15:37.480,0:15:39.580
I came down, I fell totally.

0:15:39.580,0:15:43.710
My dad was someone who was so
 strict, when it comes to academics.

0:15:43.710,0:15:46.000
Before you go ahead. You talked 
about the lifestyle

0:15:46.000,0:15:48.000
you were living. Can you just explain 
more about

0:15:48.010,0:15:49.926
all this money you were receiving from

0:15:49.926,0:15:51.660
the ritualist -  ritual money?

0:15:51.660,0:15:53.680
What were you using it for, if you can't explain more?

0:15:53.680,0:15:56.520
Like you said, you drink, smoke
 - how much were you smoking?

0:15:56.530,0:15:58.580
What were you drinking?
 How much drugs were you taking?

0:15:58.580,0:16:02.500
For people to understand, 
how you were wasting this money.

0:16:02.500,0:16:07.100
I could take about 22 - 23 packets
 of cigarettes within a day.

0:16:07.100,0:16:09.300
I drank bottles of vodka.

0:16:09.300,0:16:13.700
I was on drugs - high drugs, cocaine, weed.
I was also on pills.

0:16:13.700,0:16:17.574
I would go out there in club,
 I would blow money, throw money on air.

0:16:17.580,0:16:20.060
People would see that I was around.

0:16:20.060,0:16:24.980
Anywhere I found myself, I wanted
 my present to be felt by people.

0:16:24.980,0:16:29.040
Because I was getting money, I could
 command money anytime I wanted.

0:16:29.040,0:16:31.540
So that was the kind of lifestyle I was living.

0:16:31.540,0:16:34.060
So the money you received from this ritualists,

0:16:34.060,0:16:37.640
you could only use it for devilish purposes.

0:16:37.640,0:16:39.640
You could never use it for anything that would help you,

0:16:39.644,0:16:42.900
benefit you or glorify God?

0:16:42.900,0:16:44.100
When you start using this money,

0:16:44.100,0:16:48.800
the mindset won't come, that you
 should use it to do something good.

0:16:48.800,0:16:50.660
I was the type, any place I found myself -

0:16:50.660,0:16:53.100
as I said earlier on - I easily made friends.

0:16:53.100,0:16:56.320
Yet when someone told me he has a problem,

0:16:56.320,0:17:00.560
I feel pity for the person, but knowing
 where the money is coming from,

0:17:00.560,0:17:03.160
I just didn't want to give that money to the person.

0:17:03.160,0:17:05.900
So I used to earn monthly income from my dad.

0:17:05.900,0:17:07.520
So when that money comes,  I would give that

0:17:07.520,0:17:08.840
money to the people who need 
money from me

0:17:08.840,0:17:11.180
and then I would be spending the 
money that I commanding.

0:17:11.180,0:17:12.840
Yeah, that was what I was doing.

0:17:12.840,0:17:15.780
There was times in school, 
I started giving loans to people.

0:17:15.780,0:17:17.900
When a person comes to me and tells me his problem,

0:17:17.900,0:17:20.100
I would ask you why you need the money.

0:17:20.100,0:17:23.140
If, let's say, your problem is kind of family problem

0:17:23.140,0:17:24.700
and you need money and stuff,

0:17:24.700,0:17:28.000
willingly I will give you the loan
 from the money my dad gave me

0:17:28.000,0:17:29.500
and you won't pay back.

0:17:29.500,0:17:32.640
But when you say you want to use it for clubbing,

0:17:32.640,0:17:34.600
and I know you, you have been clubbing -
 then you are in trouble.

0:17:34.600,0:17:37.100
I would take your laptop, something bigger than

0:17:37.100,0:17:38.160
the amount I want to give you.

0:17:38.160,0:17:41.960
I would sell it that day because I knew
 you can't pay the money back.

0:17:41.960,0:17:43.400
There was no way you can pay the money back.

0:17:43.400,0:17:46.640
So I would give you a loan and sell that day.

0:17:46.640,0:17:50.600
Even if I give you three years to 
pay the money, you can't pay back.

0:17:50.620,0:17:53.100
So I hope we are listening to our brother saying

0:17:53.100,0:17:55.700
that because the source of the money he was receiving

0:17:55.700,0:17:58.320
was demonic and devilish, he never had

0:17:58.320,0:18:00.480
the mindset to use it for anything good.

0:18:00.480,0:18:02.540
He couldn't use it to help people.

0:18:02.540,0:18:04.260
He couldn't use it to give to people.

0:18:04.260,0:18:08.500
He could only use it for things such as clubbing, drinking,

0:18:08.500,0:18:10.800
womanizing and taking drugs.

0:18:10.800,0:18:15.400
He said he was smoking up to 20
 packets of cigarettes in a single day

0:18:15.400,0:18:19.020
as a result of all of this money he was using.

0:18:19.020,0:18:21.200
And tell us, how did this affect you in terms of your

0:18:21.200,0:18:23.920
education and your life generally?

0:18:23.920,0:18:26.540
From onset I was good academically;

0:18:26.540,0:18:29.540
my dad was someone who is so
 strict when it came to academics.

0:18:29.540,0:18:33.200
So I was so good, but I when I started entangling

0:18:33.200,0:18:37.500
myself with this kind of ungodly acts,

0:18:37.500,0:18:39.780
my academics fell.

0:18:39.780,0:18:47.300
I went back to the spiritualist and told
 him that my academics has gone down.

0:18:47.300,0:18:52.060
So he gave me a concoction which
 I used to bath with at midnight.

0:18:52.060,0:18:55.480
And took some each time I wanted to study.

0:18:55.480,0:19:02.340
When I took that stuff, I realized that
 everything I studied, stuck in my head.

0:19:02.340,0:19:08.180
Brother, you mentioned earlier 
that the first ritualist you went to,

0:19:08.180,0:19:10.760
initially they did not demand for blood but later on

0:19:10.760,0:19:13.440
they started demanding for blood. Now tell us,

0:19:13.440,0:19:15.480
when this witchdoctor demanded for blood,

0:19:15.480,0:19:18.780
what was your reaction? 
What did you do thereafter?

0:19:18.780,0:19:22.200
Personally, I've been to about five witchdoctors -

0:19:22.200,0:19:24.800
each time they demanded for blood, I would insult them.

0:19:24.800,0:19:27.540
I would tell them that from the onset, 
they told me that there was no blood.

0:19:27.540,0:19:31.840
There was a time I was attacked 
physically - I would see them in my dreams.

0:19:31.840,0:19:35.440
There was a time I saw one physically
 threatening that I have spent his money

0:19:35.440,0:19:37.680
and it was time for me to give him something,

0:19:37.680,0:19:39.660
and I was refusing so he was going
 to kill me.

0:19:39.660,0:19:43.060
The next day I took a phone, I 
called him and I insulted him,

0:19:43.060,0:19:45.100
then I moved to a different spiritualist.

0:19:45.100,0:19:51.140
So each time they tried doing
 something, I would just insult them.

0:19:51.140,0:19:53.800
You mentioned as well... We're just
 asking these questions

0:19:53.800,0:19:55.640
for us to learn so we too can identify

0:19:55.640,0:19:59.480
what's been happening in society
 in our lives,

0:19:59.480,0:20:02.100
so we can be careful and conscious of it.

0:20:02.100,0:20:04.380
You mentioned that there were
 different types of money

0:20:04.380,0:20:06.980
that the ritualist offered you - 
that your own in your own case

0:20:06.980,0:20:08.770
you demanded for 'instant money'.

0:20:08.770,0:20:14.100
What were the other options that he gave you,
 and tell us more about what they involved.

0:20:14.100,0:20:19.100
As I said from the onset, there was
 the 'wallet money'.

0:20:19.100,0:20:21.078
In the 'wallet money',  they 
will command money for you.

0:20:21.080,0:20:23.780
For example, if you are in Nigeria they
 will command 1000 Naira for you.

0:20:23.780,0:20:26.180
That is the highest denomination, they 
will command it for you.

0:20:26.180,0:20:27.880
Then you go outside there and buy something,

0:20:27.880,0:20:30.120
for example, 100 naira out of 1000 naira.

0:20:30.120,0:20:33.140
The storekeeper will give exchange of 900 Naira.

0:20:33.140,0:20:35.680
Now you will put the 900 naira somewhere separately

0:20:35.680,0:20:39.840
and you put the wallets that you sent 
to the spiritualist  back into your pocket.

0:20:39.840,0:20:45.060
Thirty seconds later, the thousand naira that you used in purchasing

0:20:45.060,0:20:49.240
the stuff from the shop would 
come back into your wallet.

0:20:49.240,0:20:52.080
So depending on number of shops 
you go within a day,

0:20:52.080,0:20:54.865
that will determine the amount
 of money you get within a day.

0:20:54.865,0:21:00.220
The storekeepers who trade -
 if that money mix with your money,

0:21:00.220,0:21:02.180
and you're not someone who so prayerful,

0:21:02.180,0:21:04.660
forget it!  The maximum you can go is six month -

0:21:04.660,0:21:07.820
you can't account for your money.

0:21:07.820,0:21:12.040
The second one was the 'bank money'.

0:21:12.040,0:21:15.960
That one, will come. You just send it to your bank.

0:21:15.960,0:21:19.280
To store it in a bank, now the bank 
will mix that money

0:21:19.280,0:21:21.600
with their money and then when you
 are going to withdraw

0:21:21.600,0:21:24.540
normally you have to wait for like three weeks

0:21:24.540,0:21:26.780
that is the kind of condition.

0:21:26.780,0:21:30.400
When you deposit the money in the bank, 
you wait for three weeks.

0:21:30.400,0:21:34.100
After three weeks you can go 
to the bank and withdraw the money.

0:21:34.100,0:21:35.940
When you go and withdraw the money,

0:21:35.940,0:21:38.420
you know banks give loans and stuff.

0:21:38.420,0:21:41.760
So they might have used your money
 to give a loan to someone

0:21:41.760,0:21:43.440
or they might have mixed it with your money.

0:21:43.440,0:21:46.160
Now you go for fresh money.

0:21:46.160,0:21:49.900
One thing I realized after I was delivered

0:21:49.900,0:21:53.740
was that these spiritualists when
 they charm the money for you,

0:21:53.740,0:21:57.040
they would never use a dime of that money.

0:21:57.040,0:21:59.340
They would tell you to go and send it to bank

0:21:59.340,0:22:02.300
or go and use it after which you come and thank them.

0:22:02.300,0:22:04.300
They would never spend that money, so we have to take

0:22:04.300,0:22:07.720
the money outside and bring a fresh money to them,

0:22:07.720,0:22:11.600
before they will spend it.

0:22:11.600,0:22:16.269
So the bank will mix with your money, and then you
 also go and withdraw money from the bank.

0:22:16.269,0:22:21.220
So that different money would
 come which you can send to the ritualist to spend.

0:22:21.220,0:22:28.020
If the managerial board of the bank are not God fearing, 
people who know God,

0:22:28.020,0:22:31.560
they are going to face crisis in their business.

0:22:31.560,0:22:33.680
So you mean to say that there are many people

0:22:33.680,0:22:35.900
right now who because they are not prayerful,

0:22:35.900,0:22:39.400
God-fearing, they're facing collapses in their business,

0:22:39.400,0:22:43.100
in their in their entire lives as a result of this ritual money

0:22:43.100,0:22:47.880
that people like yourself were involving
 yourselves in before your deliverance?

0:22:47.880,0:22:52.780
Yes, so after the first ritualist,

0:22:52.780,0:22:58.000
I was compelled to go for a different one.

0:22:58.000,0:23:00.080
But I didn't know how to get the money,

0:23:00.080,0:23:04.960
so I came home, picked my mum's fridge,
my mum's stuffs.

0:23:04.960,0:23:08.960
I went out there and sold them, just to get money.

0:23:08.960,0:23:13.700
So I wanted some money from my dad, 
and he told me that unless I come here,

0:23:13.700,0:23:16.360
there was no way he was going
 to give me that money.

0:23:16.360,0:23:20.220
I agreed, I had an aunt who was having a leg problem

0:23:20.220,0:23:23.680
and she was also coming here, 
and I agreed to come with her.

0:23:23.680,0:23:26.180
Now, before you get to the point of coming here,

0:23:26.180,0:23:29.680
what was your impression about 
this ministry before you came here?

0:23:29.680,0:23:31.475
Did you use to watch Emmanuel TV,

0:23:31.475,0:23:35.600
or what was your reaction to 
Emmanuel TV before you came here?

0:23:35.600,0:23:37.800
My Uncle, I have an uncle who is in Ghana,

0:23:37.800,0:23:40.060
he used to watch Emmanuel TV a lot.

0:23:40.060,0:23:41.780
So he was the one I was staying with.

0:23:41.780,0:23:43.460
Each time I was on vacation and I go home,

0:23:43.460,0:23:45.940
I would make sure I create a problem.

0:23:45.940,0:23:48.220
I would create a confusion between my uncle and I,

0:23:48.220,0:23:50.400
then I would be asked to move and 
go to stay with my aunt.

0:23:50.400,0:23:53.180
When I move to my aunts place, 
she doesn't watch Emmanuel TV,

0:23:53.180,0:23:54.123
so am always free there.

0:23:54.123,0:23:55.859
There were times I could cause problem

0:23:55.859,0:23:58.080
and I would be asked to go and
 stay with my grandmother.

0:23:58.080,0:24:02.260
At her place, my uncle has bought
 her satellite for her - a decoder.

0:24:02.260,0:24:05.000
So she always watches Emmanuel TV. 
She's old.

0:24:05.000,0:24:08.040
So I would say: "Okay". When she is there...

0:24:08.040,0:24:10.480
You know, when you change the channel she would be angry.

0:24:10.480,0:24:12.100
So I would go to the back of the decoder

0:24:12.100,0:24:15.500
and I would remove the cables of the decoder,

0:24:15.500,0:24:18.400
and then I would tell her the station has gone off.

0:24:18.400,0:24:20.900
And she would ask, "Really?"
and I would confirm, "Yes."

0:24:20.900,0:24:22.760
And she would go and sleep.

0:24:22.760,0:24:24.980
When she goes to her room, I would fix the cable back,

0:24:24.980,0:24:27.300
and watch the channel I want to watch.

0:24:27.300,0:24:31.000
So you hated Emanuel TV before coming here?

0:24:31.000,0:24:35.980
Yes! I really didn't like it. Yeah.

0:24:35.980,0:24:45.400
You know, each time I watched it,
 I just felt tormented.

0:24:45.400,0:24:48.660
Our brother is saying that he went
 to the extent that he would actually

0:24:48.660,0:24:52.620
physically go and unplug the decoder in his grandmother's

0:24:52.620,0:24:55.900
house to stop her from watching Emmanuel  TV

0:24:55.900,0:24:57.470
so he could watch what he wanted -

0:24:57.470,0:24:59.280
because anytime he watched Emmanuel TV,

0:24:59.280,0:25:02.000
he didn't feel comfortable,
 he felt something tormenting him.

0:25:02.000,0:25:06.640
So tell us, what led to your actually being here, in the 
Synagogue Church of all Nations?

0:25:06.640,0:25:09.620
Before I move to that, you know 
most of these spiritualists

0:25:09.620,0:25:13.740
I was talking about - they used to 
advertise on television.

0:25:13.740,0:25:16.540
So there was a particular station that they used to advertise - that was

0:25:16.540,0:25:18.180
the station that I liked watching.

0:25:18.180,0:25:19.880
So I would make my grandmother 
to go and sleep

0:25:19.880,0:25:22.220
and then I would put the channel.
 So I would watch.

0:25:22.220,0:25:25.500
Then I would pick my numbers 
and my things from there.

0:25:25.500,0:25:29.340
As I was saying, I wanted some money from my dad.

0:25:29.340,0:25:32.500
It got to a time I began to extort money from people.

0:25:32.500,0:25:35.900
I would take money from people, I was into fraud,

0:25:35.900,0:25:37.400
I would fraud people and take their money.

0:25:37.400,0:25:39.980
So I wanted to take money from my
 dad to add to my money,

0:25:39.988,0:25:43.240
so that I would go to a different spiritualist

0:25:43.240,0:25:47.320
because the previous one had 
asked for blood and I blasted him.

0:25:47.320,0:25:48.400
So I wanted to go for a different one.

0:25:48.400,0:25:51.000
So my dad told me that if I didn't come
 to the Synagogue Church of all Nations,

0:25:51.000,0:25:52.400
there was no way he was going to get that money.

0:25:52.400,0:25:55.060
I had an aunt who was also having a leg injury.

0:25:55.060,0:25:57.260
So I was like: "Ok, I will come with these people,

0:25:57.260,0:26:00.500
and when I come, we would end up 
in the overflow congregation,

0:26:00.500,0:26:04.320
and the wisemen would come
 around and touch her and go home.

0:26:04.320,0:26:07.300
And I would go and tell my dad that I was 
here because my aunt will testify that I was here."

0:26:07.300,0:26:10.100
So that the money I wanted would be given to me.

0:26:10.100,0:26:12.560
We went there and the foreigners were
 asked to go to a different room.

0:26:12.560,0:26:15.000
So that they would start sharing 
the pass to enter the auditorium.

0:26:15.000,0:26:19.000
When we went there, I swapped the pass three times.

0:26:19.000,0:26:22.700
First, I saw it sharing to my raw, I left my raw

0:26:22.700,0:26:24.200
and I went to sit in a different place.

0:26:24.200,0:26:27.600
They started coming again, I left 
there and I went to sit outside.

0:26:27.600,0:26:30.220
I was sitting outside, and then
 they came there again.

0:26:30.220,0:26:34.800
I was running away and the 
guy placed the pass into my hand.

0:26:34.800,0:26:38.680
Because my aunties were watching
 me, they were suspecting something.

0:26:38.680,0:26:40.400
So I just followed them.

0:26:40.400,0:26:43.880
We came and sat among the 
congregation at the back there.

0:26:43.880,0:26:48.560
I thought that my aunt will be touched and she would go

0:26:48.560,0:26:50.260
and I would go and get my money.

0:26:50.260,0:26:53.000
When I was sitting there I wasn't 
concentrating with what was happening here.

0:26:53.000,0:26:55.880
I was just thinking how I was going to get the money

0:26:55.880,0:26:57.780
and do my stuff at home.

0:26:57.780,0:27:00.060
So I was sitting there and it was testimony time.

0:27:00.060,0:27:05.660
And I saw a friend of mine here giving
 testimony about this same problem.

0:27:05.660,0:27:08.980
I was sited there and I thought,
 "Jesus Christ, this guy has been caught,

0:27:08.980,0:27:10.360
I will be the next victim."

0:27:10.360,0:27:14.160
So I had to run away because I was not safe.

0:27:14.160,0:27:16.300
So you mean the brother that gave his testimony

0:27:16.300,0:27:18.920
last week about being delivered 
from the spirit of stealing -

0:27:18.920,0:27:21.680
you knew him personally that 
you were both involved act.

0:27:21.680,0:27:24.480
Yes, I knew him personally.

0:27:24.480,0:27:27.440
I tried going out,

0:27:27.440,0:27:30.520
but then the ushers at the entrance
 couldn't allow me to go out.

0:27:30.520,0:27:33.780
I told them that I want to go and
 urinate but they refused.

0:27:33.780,0:27:36.680
So I came back and sat down,
 I was sitting down when the man of God

0:27:36.680,0:27:37.800
entered the auditorium.

0:27:37.800,0:27:40.900
Immediately he entered the auditorium
 I started sweating,

0:27:40.900,0:27:42.660
I was feeling headache,

0:27:42.660,0:27:44.613
I said I was going out, the usher told me

0:27:44.613,0:27:46.153
since the man of God was inside, there was no way,

0:27:46.160,0:27:47.840
they were not going to allow me to go out.

0:27:47.840,0:27:50.340
I asked, "What kind of nonsense was that?

0:27:50.340,0:27:52.300
I came in myself and I want to go out
 and you are telling me not to go out?"

0:27:52.300,0:27:55.200
I really pushed but they didn't allow me to go out.

0:27:55.200,0:27:59.040
So I came and sit down. Each time the man of God

0:27:59.040,0:28:01.800
came that way, I bend down my face.

0:28:01.800,0:28:03.940
When the man of God was on stage, 
there was a man of war on stage.

0:28:03.940,0:28:05.559
It was a man who stood up.

0:28:05.559,0:28:07.265
And then the man of God delivered him,

0:28:07.265,0:28:09.040
he was from my lane.

0:28:09.040,0:28:11.540
When he stood up, I thought, "What 
kind of nonsense is this?"

0:28:11.540,0:28:14.280
Won't you see you made this man 
to come to this area and I will be caught.

0:28:14.280,0:28:17.540
In fact when I was sitting down,
 I knew mine has come.

0:28:17.540,0:28:19.180
So I needed way to run away.

0:28:19.180,0:28:22.840
So I said, "What nonsense is
 this? Won't you sit down? I will be caught."

0:28:22.840,0:28:29.260
I was praying and saying, "I pray this 
man of God won't come here."

0:28:29.260,0:28:32.540
Fortunately or unfortunately for me, 
he didn't come to the other lane.

0:28:32.540,0:28:39.100
He was at the other lane 
and he left, I said, "Thank God."

0:28:39.100,0:28:43.440
The wise men started going round. It was prayer time.

0:28:43.440,0:28:45.720
They touched my aunt, she was not close to me.

0:28:45.720,0:28:48.960
She was at the far end and I was in a different place.

0:28:48.960,0:28:52.300
They touched her, I thanked
 God they have touched her.

0:28:52.300,0:28:54.000
So I was coming to move from 
where I was sitting

0:28:54.000,0:28:57.020
and go and mix with the people
 they have already touched.

0:28:57.020,0:28:59.060
So that they won't touch me, since my aunt has

0:28:59.060,0:29:01.900
been touched, you would think I 
was also touched.

0:29:01.900,0:29:09.000
There were three lanes to the
 place that I was sitting, I felt slaps.

0:29:09.000,0:29:13.120
I felt three strong slaps.

0:29:13.120,0:29:18.900
There were three guys before me at the far end.

0:29:18.900,0:29:20.900
I was seeing him as a human being

0:29:20.900,0:29:25.460
but then when he got closer to 
me, I was seeing fire.

0:29:25.460,0:29:31.480
I wanted to run away, but the guys had hold 
me so stiff that I couldn't run away.

0:29:31.480,0:29:37.320
I realized that I was on the floor, 
and I was asked to rise up.

0:29:37.320,0:29:42.380
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:29:42.380,0:29:44.916
So brother, just describe again as the wiseman

0:29:44.916,0:29:47.189
approached you, when you were trying to leave the place -

0:29:47.189,0:29:49.020
you said you felt something slap you.

0:29:49.020,0:29:52.220
Just describe exactly what happened at that moment.

0:29:52.220,0:29:55.200
I felt a slap from behind.

0:29:55.210,0:30:00.100
I turned like this and another one came.

0:30:00.100,0:30:03.900
I was wondering because I have been through prayers.

0:30:03.900,0:30:07.060
My parents have taken me through pastors.

0:30:07.060,0:30:08.838
I would go there with a problem, the next thing they

0:30:08.840,0:30:10.720
would tell me that I was coming to travel abroad.

0:30:10.720,0:30:14.700
I should go and bring money.

0:30:14.700,0:30:18.300
I would feel happy that I was traveling abroad, 
so I would go and bring the money.

0:30:18.300,0:30:23.680
But I realized since I came, sitting 
down there and I started feeling slaps.

0:30:23.680,0:30:28.560
I thought, "This place wasn't safe for me, 
I thought it was, so I have to go."

0:30:28.560,0:30:34.340
All the ways that I was trying to escape was not helping.

0:30:34.340,0:30:37.700
The ushers were on my neck.

0:30:37.700,0:30:40.300
They just didn't want me to go out.

0:30:40.300,0:30:46.100
So when the wiseman came 
closer, another slap came.

0:30:46.100,0:30:48.700
I thought, "Today I have been caught."

0:30:48.700,0:30:50.860
I told myself - the end has come!

0:30:50.860,0:30:56.400
Because if my friend was standing here
 testifying, my end has come.

0:30:56.400,0:30:59.960
I just saw fire.

0:30:59.960,0:31:04.680
The fire was so intense

0:31:04.680,0:31:09.300
that I tried running away,
 but the ushers held me so tight.

0:31:09.300,0:31:11.000
I couldn't do anything.

0:31:11.000,0:31:14.460
Then I realized I was on the floor, 
and I was asked to rise up.

0:31:14.460,0:31:20.700
One more time, people of God, 
let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:31:20.700,0:31:23.100
So brother, it has been one week now since

0:31:23.100,0:31:25.351
your deliverance. By the grace of God you've been here, in

0:31:25.360,0:31:28.360
the Synagogue Church of all Nations
 and spending time in God's presence.

0:31:28.360,0:31:31.120
Just tell us what is the transformation in your life

0:31:31.120,0:31:33.720
ever since your deliverance?

0:31:33.720,0:31:37.020
Last week since I have been here, 
I've not been on any alcohol.

0:31:37.020,0:31:38.309
I've not been on any drug.

0:31:38.309,0:31:45.220
I feel revealed, all the thoughts I was
 having in my head - they are all gone.

0:31:45.220,0:31:50.900
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:31:50.900,0:31:53.340
So right now, as you're standing here,

0:31:53.340,0:31:56.220
what can you say about going to ritualists,

0:31:56.220,0:31:59.840
getting money - quick money,
 instant money - through demonic means?

0:31:59.840,0:32:01.140
I mean now, you're standing here,

0:32:01.140,0:32:04.200
you've been delivered. What do
 you want to say about such issues?

0:32:04.200,0:32:06.720
You know, in life

0:32:06.720,0:32:08.540
we all have different track race,

0:32:08.540,0:32:10.180
we didn't start at the same time.

0:32:10.180,0:32:13.940
Let's say, someone probably may 
have committed series of abortion,

0:32:13.940,0:32:17.960
but immediately she gets married
 she gets pregnant instantly.

0:32:17.960,0:32:23.540
But a virgin also waits centuries
 after she would give birth.

0:32:23.540,0:32:27.440
Someone who completes university at the age of 20,

0:32:27.440,0:32:31.420
and she has to wait home for like five
 years before he gets employment.

0:32:31.420,0:32:35.260
Someone who also completes at age
 25 immediately get employment.

0:32:35.260,0:32:39.100
I've realized that we all don't have the same track

0:32:39.100,0:32:41.720
and our finish lines are not the same.

0:32:41.720,0:32:45.260
Now, with this devilish thing the 
devil will never give you something

0:32:45.260,0:32:47.000
without taking something back from you.

0:32:47.000,0:32:51.480
If he doesn't take it in kind, he is
 going to take it physically.

0:32:51.480,0:32:56.740
It's either your money, 
your child or something that you cherish.

0:32:56.740,0:32:59.200
And mostly when they are coming, they come for something you cherish most.

0:32:59.200,0:33:01.160
That is what I realized.

0:33:01.160,0:33:06.220
Because they realized, let's say,
 I like kids. I was playing with kids,

0:33:06.220,0:33:09.380
I like helping people, they would ask me to give money,

0:33:09.380,0:33:12.120
out of the money they would
 charm for me to virgins - which are kids.

0:33:12.120,0:33:13.920
So eventually like playing with kids,

0:33:13.920,0:33:21.140
they will use those kids that I like playing 
with as a source or kind of to satisfy their gods.

0:33:21.140,0:33:24.640
I realized also in life although you might

0:33:24.640,0:33:27.360
be going through challenges, the ups and downs in life,

0:33:27.360,0:33:29.060
bu it is not the end.

0:33:29.060,0:33:32.920
The devil will give you something to sustain you,

0:33:32.920,0:33:35.700
but he would never give you a solution.

0:33:35.700,0:33:38.480
It's only the Lord Jesus Christ that 
can give you the final solution

0:33:38.480,0:33:46.680
that can release you from all your entangles,
 that can release you from your case.

0:33:46.680,0:33:49.300
It's only the Lord Jesus Christ 
that can help you.

0:33:49.300,0:33:52.160
With this Emmanuel TV and the anointing water and the anointed sticker.

0:33:52.160,0:33:53.660
It is real.

0:33:53.660,0:34:00.580
First, I was a critic, my people would be using it and I would tell them not to use it.

0:34:00.580,0:34:04.280
There were times I could go to 
church and intentionally fall

0:34:04.280,0:34:06.200
for the people around me to think that I am delivered,

0:34:06.200,0:34:08.760
so that when I go to ask for money they would give me.

0:34:08.760,0:34:11.620
So when they touched me, I would pretend and fall

0:34:11.620,0:34:13.600
but here I wasn't touched.

0:34:13.600,0:34:17.120
In fact, I wasn't touched, I just fall -
 I don't know what happened.

0:34:17.120,0:34:19.900
So there is God here, so if you
 come here,

0:34:19.900,0:34:21.440
believing there is God here,

0:34:21.440,0:34:24.060
trust me -  you are going to be
 delivered in Jesus' name.

0:34:24.060,0:34:26.580
Amen, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ

0:34:26.580,0:34:28.800
for our brother's wonderful deliverance.

0:34:28.810,0:34:31.200
So just a final question for our brother.
 Now,

0:34:31.200,0:34:33.300
that Jesus Christ has delivered you -

0:34:33.300,0:34:35.680
what do you want to say to people outside

0:34:35.680,0:34:39.780
there, who are still involving themselves
 in money rituals,

0:34:39.780,0:34:44.180
and visiting spiritualists, witchdoctors, herbalists?
 What do you want to say to them?

0:34:44.180,0:34:46.180
My advice to these people is:

0:34:46.180,0:34:47.360
now, that I have been delivered,

0:34:47.360,0:34:49.820
I hope that Lord Jesus Christ has delivered

0:34:49.820,0:34:52.760
all those girls that I used to give money to

0:34:52.760,0:34:55.660
out of the hands of the devil.

0:34:55.660,0:35:02.900
My advice first  goes to parents out there.
If someone starts giving your kid money,

0:35:02.900,0:35:09.480
you should question where the 
person is getting the money from.

0:35:09.480,0:35:11.780
Secondly, it goes to women out there.

0:35:11.780,0:35:15.160
Please, when you have your menstruation,

0:35:15.160,0:35:20.240
please dig a hole or find a way
 of disposing your menstrual pads.

0:35:20.240,0:35:23.200
And then also to my friends out there,

0:35:23.200,0:35:27.440
to the big men and the big guys that I met.

0:35:27.440,0:35:29.180
I know some of them might be watching me.

0:35:29.180,0:35:32.600
I met them, when I was going to

0:35:32.600,0:35:37.280
the spiritualist for my help.
 They should all come to Jesus Christ.

0:35:37.280,0:35:41.180
Because there is no final solution
 than in the house of the Lord.

0:35:41.180,0:35:45.000
Because we've tried it and I have moved steps

0:35:45.000,0:35:48.680
but then I've realized that with all this spiritualists,

0:35:48.680,0:35:50.380
they all have their rules.

0:35:50.380,0:35:52.240
These rules are never the same.

0:35:52.240,0:35:55.540
But I have realized with our Jesus Christ His rule is one.

0:35:55.540,0:35:58.100
The Bible is only one.

0:35:58.100,0:35:59.600
There is no Bible that is going to come after

0:35:59.600,0:36:02.300
and there is no Bible that came before.

0:36:02.300,0:36:04.800
But then with all these spiritualists - they all use

0:36:04.800,0:36:07.140
different books and they all have their rules.

0:36:07.140,0:36:11.080
So we should all stick to one rule. 
Which is the rule of our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:36:11.080,0:36:15.580
They should all come for deliverance, 
and I hope that the Lord Jesus Christ

0:36:15.580,0:36:20.300
who delivered me out of this bondage,
 would take them all out in Jesus' name.

0:36:20.300,0:36:23.600
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:36:23.600,0:36:27.400
So I hope we understood what our 
brother said there. Now, that he is delivered,

0:36:27.400,0:36:31.200
he knows that all of those virgin 
girls that was giving money to -

0:36:31.200,0:36:34.580
and as a result of that would lose 
their menstruation

0:36:34.580,0:36:36.840
and would never be able to have a child -

0:36:36.840,0:36:41.600
he says that they too are delivered and 
all the people who have touched this

0:36:41.600,0:36:44.679
ritual money that he was involved in through his deliverance -

0:36:44.680,0:36:47.920
God has touched them and delivered them as well.

0:36:47.920,0:36:50.420
And finally, brother, you said that 
you've been involved in this from

0:36:50.420,0:36:52.600
the age of eight. How old are you right now?

0:36:52.600,0:36:55.220
I'm 20 years old.

0:36:55.220,0:36:57.880
So you can just imagine how at
 this young age of our brother,

0:36:57.880,0:37:01.900
satan has really been using him, 
but we thank Jesus Christ that today

0:37:01.900,0:37:06.020
he is delivered and we give all the
 glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:37:06.020,0:37:08.780
We pray that God will give you the 
grace to maintain this deliverance

0:37:08.780,0:37:14.020
so that what you've received will stand
 the test of time in Jesus' name.

0:37:14.020,0:37:19.640
We believe you have been inspired
 by the clip you have just watched.
