Immortal invisible God Faithful One
You are my King Invisible God

0:00:18.580,0:00:28.240
Great and Mighty One
There is none like You

0:00:28.240,0:00:52.440
For You are God all by Yourself

0:00:52.440,0:01:01.820
Forever You are the same
There is none like You

0:01:01.820,0:01:24.960
You are God all by Yourself

0:01:24.960,0:01:49.560
Forever You are the same
There is none like You

0:01:49.560,0:01:52.620
Thank you.

0:01:52.620,0:01:56.060
You may have your seats; thank you.

0:01:56.060,0:01:57.600
Glory be to God.

0:01:57.600,0:02:00.580
Hallelujah.

0:02:00.580,0:02:01.920
(Amen.)

0:02:01.920,0:02:13.440
Faith requires us to speak them before we see or feel them.

0:02:13.440,0:02:22.920
You have to begin by believing, confessing and acting on God’s Word.

0:02:22.920,0:02:29.300
Then, you can bring Jesus on the scene, by believing.

0:02:29.300,0:02:37.880
This is what our faith requires – believing, confessing and acting on what?

0:02:37.880,0:02:40.400
On God’s Word.

0:02:40.400,0:02:47.780
You can bring Jesus on the scene, instantly.

0:02:47.780,0:02:50.940
It means you are not alone on your seat.

0:02:50.940,0:03:01.220
That you are sitting, looking – to many, you are not talking but your faith is talking.

0:03:01.220,0:03:11.620
I want to hear what your faith is saying because the words you speak determine the life you enjoy.

0:03:11.620,0:03:18.060
The words that are going on in your heart determine the life you enjoy.

0:03:18.060,0:03:19.700
Tell your neighbour.

0:03:19.700,0:03:23.180
(The words that are going on in your heart determine the life you enjoy.)

0:03:23.180,0:03:25.940
No, I don't know what you are saying.

0:03:25.940,0:03:31.120
You are sitting quietly but your faith is talking.

0:03:31.120,0:03:37.640
I'm saying: what is going on in your heart determines the life you enjoy.

0:03:37.640,0:03:38.900
Tell your neighbour.

0:03:38.900,0:03:42.960
(What is going on in your heart determines the life you enjoy.)

0:03:42.960,0:03:50.560
That is, the words you speak determine the life you enjoy.

0:03:50.560,0:03:53.080
They say, "I'm sitting down, I'm not talking."

0:03:53.080,0:03:55.100
Who told you you were not talking?

0:03:55.100,0:03:58.560
Something is going on.

0:03:58.560,0:04:04.200
"Look at this man. What is he saying? Hmm."

0:04:04.200,0:04:11.220
A lot is going on in your heart - it determines the life you enjoy next.

0:04:11.220,0:04:21.880
The words a man speaks create the blessing or curses in his way.

0:04:21.880,0:04:40.460
The reason is that your mouth is a revealer of the belief in your heart.

0:04:40.460,0:04:42.860
What is going on in your heart?

0:04:42.860,0:04:48.760
Something is going on – you are saying something; you know you have no control.

0:04:48.760,0:04:51.100
If I am not talking, my faith is talking.

0:04:51.100,0:04:52.420
Tell your neighbour.

0:04:52.420,0:04:54.600
(If I am not talking, my faith is talking.)

0:04:54.600,0:04:57.400
If I am not moving, my faith is moving.

0:04:57.400,0:04:59.980
(If I am not moving, my faith is moving.)

0:04:59.980,0:05:02.680
If I am not looking, my faith is looking.

0:05:02.680,0:05:04.220
(If I am not looking, my faith is looking.)

0:05:04.220,0:05:11.160
Just close your eyes and say, "I'm not looking, I can't see anything." - your faith is looking.

0:05:11.160,0:05:14.500
You say you are sleeping.

0:05:14.500,0:05:16.980
You faith is alive.

0:05:16.980,0:05:26.440
That is why if anyone comes to you in the dream...

0:05:26.440,0:05:38.300
Later I say, "Oh. It was a dream. I'm not talking, I'm not going to talk." - your faith is talking.

0:05:38.300,0:05:44.200
"I'm not praying. I'm not going to pray. I don't believe. I'm not going to pray."

0:05:44.200,0:05:47.840
Who told you are not praying?

0:05:47.840,0:05:51.040
How will you live next?

0:05:51.040,0:05:53.980
"I'm not going to pray" - they say your brother doesn't pray.

0:05:53.980,0:05:57.700
Who told you your brother doesn't pray?

0:05:57.700,0:06:02.760
His heart is saying something.

0:06:02.760,0:06:11.720
If you want to know what a man’s heart is saying, the next life will tell you.

0:06:11.720,0:06:15.700
Not now, next will tell you.

0:06:15.700,0:06:20.980
When a man suddenly falls on the floor...

0:06:20.980,0:06:32.760
Before that falling there was a thought that was going in his heart, "I hope I will not fall. I will fall. I will not fall.

0:06:32.760,0:06:34.300
I feel dizzy."

0:06:34.300,0:06:37.340
Before you know it you find yourself on the floor.

0:06:37.340,0:06:41.760
Sometimes, for you to know that it is not possible for you not to talk -

0:06:41.760,0:06:43.800
if you are not talking your faith is talking.

0:06:43.800,0:06:47.400
Sometimes, you would be just sitting down; something will be telling you,

0:06:47.400,0:06:53.260
"That my brother Kenneth is coming; he will be coming now. He will come today."

0:06:53.260,0:06:56.100
Before you know it you see brother Kenneth.

0:06:56.100,0:07:00.880
Only you will say, "This is what is going on in my heart."

0:07:00.880,0:07:10.140
Also if it is evil, you sit and say, "Ah, this vehicle seems - it will have an accident."

0:07:10.140,0:07:12.980
Only you, nobody knows you are talking about that.

0:07:12.980,0:07:19.040
Before you know it - an accident, "This is what was going on in my heart."

0:07:19.040,0:07:24.400
Say, “If I am not talking, my faith is talking.”

0:07:24.400,0:07:29.560
If I am not praying, my faith is praying.

0:07:29.560,0:07:30.560
What kind of faith?

0:07:30.560,0:07:36.240
Is it faith in faith or faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ?

0:07:36.240,0:07:39.200
That will determine the life you enjoy.

0:07:39.200,0:07:43.620
If I am not talking, my faith is talking.

0:07:43.620,0:07:48.200
That is why sometimes - I stop praying because I want you to hear what I'm going to say.

0:07:48.200,0:07:52.020
I say, "In Jesus' name" because I want you to hear me.

0:07:52.020,0:07:58.480
After that "In Jesus' name", everyone will see me stretching my hand, and they get healed.

0:07:58.480,0:08:04.560
In the past they said, "This man does not mention the name 'Jesus'. He doesn't call the name 'Jesus' -

0:08:04.560,0:08:06.380
we don't know whom he is calling."

0:08:06.380,0:08:11.560
OK, Pharisees and Sadducees, “In Jesus’ name…”.

0:08:11.560,0:08:15.540
By the time I do that for ten people, I will get tired.

0:08:15.540,0:08:23.360
I have employed flesh in calling the name Jesus.

0:08:23.360,0:08:29.580
We employ much flesh to the things of the Spirit.

0:08:29.580,0:08:35.540
Once you light a candle, it is lightened - just place it.

0:08:35.540,0:08:41.980
So, you cannot light the candle, and light it again... no.

0:08:41.980,0:08:44.660
Since it is not quenched, it is not off.

0:08:44.660,0:08:48.420
You just light a candle - that is the name of Jesus.

0:08:48.420,0:08:54.540
But if it is not lightened, you continue to light it...

0:08:54.540,0:09:00.400
Once you want to pray for four people here; in the face of sister you say, "In the name of Jesus",

0:09:00.400,0:09:04.780
and you know Jesus hears you - He will continue to follow you to do the rest.

0:09:04.780,0:09:07.660
It is when you know Jesus...

0:09:07.660,0:09:10.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:10.800,0:09:18.880
It is when you know Jesus, and He does hear what you are saying; you say, "In Jesus name - be healed"...

0:09:18.880,0:09:21.980
Because you don't believe Jesus has heard you.

0:09:21.980,0:09:27.960
Our mouth is a revealer of the belief in our heart.

0:09:27.960,0:09:36.120
There is power in our mouth but belief in our heart is released by faith.

0:09:36.120,0:09:58.940
The belief in our heart is released by faith and faith requires us to speak before we feel or see it.

0:09:58.940,0:10:05.500
The words we speak determine the life we enjoy.

0:10:05.500,0:10:09.180
What life are you enjoying?

0:10:09.180,0:10:14.520
This is the reason when we say, “In Jesus’ name”,

0:10:14.520,0:10:19.060
and another man says, “In Jesus’ name”, we see different results -

0:10:19.060,0:10:26.960
some idle, some meaningless, some oftentimes destructive.

0:10:26.960,0:10:32.440
Some will say, "In Jesus' name" - the result is meaningless.

0:10:32.440,0:10:40.100
Other will say, "In Jesus' name" - the outcome is idle.

0:10:40.100,0:10:47.680
Another people will say, "In Jesus' name" - oftentimes it is destructive.

0:10:47.680,0:10:50.560
What is the cause of this?

0:10:50.560,0:11:02.000
If the words you speak in prayer, preaching or teaching are not according to the Word of God,

0:11:02.000,0:11:05.380
are not according to the Spirit of God,

0:11:05.380,0:11:14.260
they oftentimes remain idle, meaningless and destructive.

0:11:14.260,0:11:17.960
If they are not according to the Word of God,

0:11:17.960,0:11:31.200
if the are not according to the Spirit of God, they remain idle, meaningless, oftentimes destructive.

0:11:31.200,0:11:39.820
You just say... when you want to sleep you say, "In Jesus' name I pray, Lord...".

0:11:39.820,0:11:44.180
You now open the Bible and pray.

0:11:44.180,0:11:50.420
In that night the demon will come and wake you up and start beating you.

0:11:50.420,0:11:58.760
He will even carry the Bible you placed on the bed and he will hit you with it, "What are you saying?"

0:11:58.760,0:12:05.500
By the time you wake up you say, "Ah. I pray, I call the name 'Jesus' and I open the Bible;

0:12:05.500,0:12:10.560
and this is a serious nightmare. Why demon is still fighting me?"

0:12:10.560,0:12:16.900
Because your prayers are not according to the Word of God, not according to the Spirit of God.

0:12:16.900,0:12:28.220
And the Bible says that the Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.

0:12:28.220,0:12:28.980
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:28.980,0:12:40.760
The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.

0:12:40.760,0:12:42.220
I cannot hear you.

0:12:42.220,0:12:47.700
(The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.)

0:12:47.700,0:12:55.260
The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in honour of His Word.

0:12:55.260,0:12:56.000
Again.

0:12:56.000,0:13:06.080
The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in honour of His Word.

0:13:06.080,0:13:18.280
So, if you now stand to say, "Jesus... Help me, Jesus. In Jesus' name"...

0:13:18.280,0:13:24.860
There is the language of today and the language of the Bible.

0:13:24.860,0:13:29.120
If what you are saying is not the language of the Bible,

0:13:29.120,0:13:35.920
I mean, not according to God’s Word, not according to the Spirit of God,

0:13:35.920,0:13:47.620
it will remain idle, meaningless or oftentimes destructive.

0:13:47.620,0:13:52.480
You will invite demons; that will invite demons to come and attack you.

0:13:52.480,0:13:55.740
Because if anywhere demons hear the name Jesus they want to...

0:13:55.740,0:14:00.040
They will just look, "Who is calling Jesus?"

0:14:00.040,0:14:05.700
And if they know there is no authority; and you are not calling the name 'Jesus' according to His Spirit,

0:14:05.700,0:14:10.120
not according to God's Word - they will jump on you.

0:14:10.120,0:14:15.960
This is what happened to seven sons of Sheva.

0:14:15.960,0:14:24.600
They said, "Jesus we know, God of Paul we know. Who are you?"

0:14:24.600,0:14:31.220
Because they realized that the name 'Jesus' they were calling was not according to His Spirit,

0:14:31.220,0:14:35.240
was not according to His Word.

0:14:35.240,0:14:36.240
They attacked them.

0:14:36.240,0:14:44.040
Many of us have been attacked, if the name is not according to His Word, or according to His Spirit -

0:14:44.040,0:14:45.320
you will be attacked.

0:14:45.320,0:14:51.260
"I call the name 'Jesus'. I believe in Jesus" - but not according to His Spirit, not according to His Word.

0:14:51.260,0:14:59.300
There is what we call, "language of today" and "language of the Bible".

0:14:59.300,0:15:10.100
The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in honour of His Word; that is God's Word.

0:15:10.100,0:15:20.120
So, you can see now the reason why you have to be genuine; you have to be properly born-again.

0:15:20.120,0:15:23.500
There are many claiming to be Christians, all over the world.

0:15:23.500,0:15:28.760
You see them and keep asking yourself, "What is wrong?"

0:15:28.760,0:15:34.900
No, if your Christianity is not according to His Word, according to His Spirit;

0:15:34.900,0:15:44.920
my brother, your life will remain meaningless, idle, and many times attacked.

0:15:44.920,0:15:48.280
That name 'Jesus'; when you call it...

0:15:48.280,0:15:53.940
Whoever calls that name; whether you have the right to call that name, according to Spirit,

0:15:53.940,0:15:55.360
or according to His Word,

0:15:55.360,0:15:59.740
or you don't have any right to call it - you are just calling the name because other call that name -

0:15:59.740,0:16:06.660
satan always, "Ha! 'Jesus' - who is the person?"

0:16:06.660,0:16:14.620
He wants to know by what authority, meaning - are you calling the name according to His Word?

0:16:14.620,0:16:17.140
Who gave the right to call that name?

0:16:17.140,0:16:21.460
Are you calling the name according to His Spirit?

0:16:21.460,0:16:26.620
We can now see where our problem is coming from.

0:16:26.620,0:16:34.000
Our problem is coming from, "We are not Christians according to His Word.

0:16:34.000,0:16:37.840
We are not Christians according to His Spirit."

0:16:37.840,0:16:42.200
You can only be a Christian according to His Spirit.

0:16:42.200,0:16:48.820
You must be led - that is what I mean.

0:16:48.820,0:16:54.740
No one can say, “Jesus is Lord”, except by what?

0:16:54.740,0:16:56.240
By the Spirit!

0:16:56.240,0:17:04.260
It means you must be led to be a Christian.

0:17:04.260,0:17:19.340
No one can say, “Jesus is Lord”, except he is led, helped, guided by the Spirit.

0:17:19.340,0:17:27.860
This is why there is a fashion all over; we have religious people and we have Christians - there is a difference.

0:17:27.860,0:17:31.000
Christians / religious people.

0:17:31.000,0:17:38.420
There is a difference - the difference is just that: as a Christian you must be led by the Spirit.

0:17:38.420,0:17:42.480
You can start now; and how do we start this?

0:17:42.480,0:17:47.880
Yes; begin to meditate over the verses.

0:17:47.880,0:17:52.780
Not thinking about the verses; thinking is different from meditation.

0:17:52.780,0:17:56.400
You can only think about your challenges, problems, debts,

0:17:56.400,0:18:02.400
but when you talk of meditation you talk of your heart.

0:18:02.400,0:18:04.840
You mean devotion.

0:18:04.840,0:18:11.600
If not, many of us will get there, before we know we are not Christians.

0:18:11.600,0:18:16.640
And I don't want you to get there, before you know you are not a Christian.

0:18:16.640,0:18:23.500
With what we are seeing in the world today, it is so difficult to actually know who is Christian.

0:18:23.500,0:18:25.540
It is so difficult.

0:18:25.540,0:18:28.080
Because ceremonies, everything...

0:18:28.080,0:18:33.660
The church have been taken over by ceremonies.

0:18:33.660,0:18:35.460
You will be shocked.

0:18:35.460,0:18:42.140
It is so difficult; only Spirit of God can tell you, "This is Christian and this is religious man." - you don't know.

0:18:42.140,0:18:43.700
It is so difficult.

0:18:43.700,0:18:48.640
I don't want you to get there, before you know you are not a Christian.

0:18:48.640,0:18:59.300
Everywhere ceremonies, according to the syllabus, table or program - that is not Christianity.

0:18:59.300,0:19:05.940
The Church of the Holy Spirit should be next, not now.

0:19:05.940,0:19:11.980
Whatever we are doing in the Church of the Holy Spirit should be next, not now.

0:19:11.980,0:19:22.140
But today, now is the church; we know we want to do, read, sing - everything is in the syllabus

0:19:22.140,0:19:25.140
how things should be - conventions.

0:19:25.140,0:19:29.860
The Spirit inspires us from time to time, from moment to moment; telling us next.

0:19:29.860,0:19:35.460
Sometimes, we get loosed, disconnected; we don't know what to do next.

0:19:35.460,0:19:41.320
That will attest to our fitting; if you fit or you don't fit - you can know.

0:19:41.320,0:19:46.100
But how do you know if you fit, when what you want to do is already on the paper?

0:19:46.100,0:19:49.880
It is programmed, you just need to read it.

0:19:49.880,0:19:52.400
You can know if you fit.

0:19:52.400,0:19:55.140
I take you back again.

0:19:55.140,0:20:04.100
The Spirit of God will be released to the degree you stand in reverence,

0:20:04.100,0:20:07.300
I mean, in honour of His Word.

0:20:07.300,0:20:10.640
How do you honour His Word?

0:20:10.640,0:20:13.480
How do we honour His Word?

0:20:13.480,0:20:18.800
The Word of God must be integral – that is, part of you.

0:20:18.800,0:20:22.340
It stays here and later goes there.

0:20:22.340,0:20:27.380
It must be in your heart by meditation.

0:20:27.380,0:20:30.300
By meditation, your heart can act upon the Word.

0:20:30.300,0:20:32.800
Heart means your spirit.

0:20:32.800,0:20:37.100
That is, your spirit acts upon the Word by meditation.

0:20:37.100,0:20:46.700
When your spirit acts upon the Word, it begins to influence your character and behaviours.

0:20:46.700,0:20:57.080
"I don't want to smoke" - you can only stop that smoking when the Word acts upon your spirit; it will stop you.

0:20:57.080,0:21:02.300
But if the Word has not yet acted upon your spirit, and you say you want to stop smoking;

0:21:02.300,0:21:03.800
you will stop for a while.

0:21:03.800,0:21:09.060
After some time, you start in a big way.

0:21:09.060,0:21:16.560
By meditation, our heart acts upon the Word.

0:21:16.560,0:21:23.500
That is, your spirit acts upon the Word; that is joined, immersed.

0:21:23.500,0:21:30.240
When that happens, it begins to influence your conduct, your character.

0:21:30.240,0:21:37.140
What you say, "I cannot stop smoking" - you just find that smoking stopped,

0:21:37.140,0:21:44.720
because that Word has acted upon your spirit.

0:21:44.720,0:21:50.060
Sometimes you say, "I don't know; I've been trying to stop. I'm a child of God. I've been coming to church.

0:21:50.060,0:21:51.680
They have prayed for me."

0:21:51.680,0:21:53.940
The prayer will not do that.

0:21:53.940,0:21:57.760
"They have prayed for me" - to build your character.

0:21:57.760,0:22:07.320
Prayer cannot do anything if the prayer is not offered according to His Spirit, His Word.

0:22:07.320,0:22:11.460
So please, let us be genuine, OK?

0:22:11.460,0:22:15.080
Because sometimes you just begin, continue to fake yourself.

0:22:15.080,0:22:17.300
And you don't even know.

0:22:17.300,0:22:22.420
You will not even know; that is why I don't want us to get there before we know.

0:22:22.420,0:22:26.120
It will be too late, to get there before we know.

0:22:26.120,0:22:32.800
Ignorance is not an excuse.

0:22:32.800,0:22:38.980
We have so much wisdom, knowledge about the Bible but that knowledge

0:22:38.980,0:22:45.540
does not seem to be according to His Spirit, not according to His Word.

0:22:45.540,0:22:57.540
You will preach it, teach it; very good teacher, when you are give a mic to preach here... he is a good preacher.

0:22:57.540,0:23:02.160
You may be a good preacher but not according to His Spirit.

0:23:02.160,0:23:12.820
Tell your neighbour, "You may be a good preacher but not according to His Spirit."

0:23:12.820,0:23:18.400
That is, the presence of God is the Spirit.

0:23:18.400,0:23:23.140
The presence of God in what we are saying is that Spirit.

0:23:23.140,0:23:30.160
You can talk without the presence of God, "Jesus!"; people will say, "Oh my God - it is a good preacher" -

0:23:30.160,0:23:35.060
not according to His Spirit.

0:23:35.060,0:23:37.820
So, now, I want to leave you here.

0:23:37.820,0:23:44.380
The way out: meditation.

0:23:44.380,0:23:46.900
When we say 'meditation';

0:23:46.900,0:23:53.320
take more of me, oh Lord Jesus; give me more of You, of Lord Jesus.

0:23:53.320,0:23:56.760
When you are saying this; even your body will not move.

0:23:56.760,0:23:59.220
Nobody will know what you are saying.

0:23:59.220,0:24:07.080
Take more of me; give me more of You – more of Your obedience, more of Your kindness,

0:24:07.080,0:24:15.720
more of Your purity, more of Your faithfulness, more of Your holiness.

0:24:15.720,0:24:18.780
Take more of me, Lord and give me more of You.

0:24:18.780,0:24:23.780
This is what you should engage your heart in.

0:24:23.780,0:24:28.920
If you don’t engage your heart, your heart will engage itself.

0:24:28.920,0:24:34.140
Engaging your heart; begin to pray at the same time as you hear me, "What this man is saying?

0:24:34.140,0:24:45.960
Give me the grace to do it, to practice it.

0:24:45.960,0:24:54.620
Take more of me, Lord. Give me a hearing heart."

0:24:54.620,0:24:56.240
This is what you should engage on.

0:24:56.240,0:24:59.880
If you don’t engage your heart, your heart will engage itself.

0:24:59.880,0:25:05.880
You have to engage your heart in sowing to the Spirit.

0:25:05.880,0:25:11.000
Give me a hearing heart, Lord.

0:25:11.000,0:25:17.300
This is it.

0:25:17.300,0:25:26.820
When you are saying this, automatically your heart will act upon the Word I am speaking to you.

0:25:26.820,0:25:31.700
The heart doesn’t just act upon the Word without the grace.

0:25:31.700,0:25:38.540
While you are saying that, your heart will act upon the Word and when the heart acts upon the Word,

0:25:38.540,0:25:45.600
you will suddenly find your character and behaviour changing.

0:25:45.600,0:25:52.660
What you felt you couldn't stop; you will start stopping them.

0:25:52.660,0:25:57.020
Take more of me, give me more of You - give me a hearing heart.

0:25:57.020,0:26:05.520
So, you create a habit; for you to be great in the Lord you must have a habit.

0:26:05.520,0:26:16.520
It means; the time for yourself, the time to meditate on the Word of God.

0:26:16.520,0:26:18.400
You talk of prayer...

0:26:18.400,0:26:24.740
Prayer cannot work without your spirit joining itself to God’s Word.

0:26:24.740,0:26:32.840
Tell your neighbour, “There’s no prayer without your heart acting upon the Word.”

0:26:32.840,0:26:39.040
This is what we are taught today, "Prayer is the key. Prayer is the master-key."

0:26:39.040,0:26:46.860
It is master-key, when your heart acts upon the Word it becomes prayer.

0:26:46.860,0:26:48.080
Look at what I said.

0:26:48.080,0:26:56.460
I said to you that the Word you speak determines the life you enjoy, if the heart acts upon the Word.

0:26:56.460,0:26:59.720
Take note of that; my heart must act upon the Word.

0:26:59.720,0:27:01.280
This is what I mean by;

0:27:01.280,0:27:10.160
the Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
