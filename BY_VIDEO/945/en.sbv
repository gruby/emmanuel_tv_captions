The viewers I know are aware that the prayer today will cover them until next Sunday.

0:00:07.700,0:00:09.900
What a mighty grace.

0:00:09.900,0:00:18.000
Each day you wake up and tune to Emmanuel TV, the prayer you receive is now -

0:00:18.000,0:00:18.720

0:00:30.880,0:00:33.320
That is the prayer we are offering now.

0:00:33.320,0:00:38.120
The grace is mighty.

0:00:38.120,0:00:41.640
We asked God and He released the grace.

0:00:41.640,0:00:53.640
Viewers all over the world, those under the influence of my voice,

0:00:53.640,0:01:04.560
it is time to combat demons and whatever situation you are in – setback, affliction;

0:01:04.560,0:01:11.300
it is time to combat demons and that situation with the Word.

0:01:11.300,0:01:14.440
(Amen.)

0:01:14.440,0:01:22.360
Remember, the Word is the sword of the recreated spirit.

0:01:22.360,0:01:27.720
We walk by faith.

0:01:27.720,0:01:33.120
We require no evidence of the senses.

0:01:33.120,0:01:40.860
We have proof that the things which we are praying for have come.

0:01:40.860,0:01:42.720
(Amen.)

0:01:42.720,0:01:44.840
Take note of that.

0:01:44.840,0:01:51.900
I will not come here to pray for you if I don’t know what I am going to pray for or what we are going to recieve.

0:01:51.900,0:02:04.140
Already, the things we are about to pray for have come – healing, blessing, victory, deliverance - they have come.

0:02:04.140,0:02:07.680
(Amen!)

0:02:07.680,0:02:11.060
What a God we serve.

0:02:11.060,0:02:20.400
I will not come out and begin to pray when I don’t know God's will, when I don't know God's intention,

0:02:20.400,0:02:25.020
when I don't know God's promise - that is in vain.

0:02:25.020,0:02:33.860
I know before coming to pray that what we are about to pray for, the things we are about to pray for have come.

0:02:33.860,0:02:35.540
(Amen.)

0:02:35.540,0:02:44.520
Tell your neighbour viewers, the things we are about to pray for have come -

0:02:44.520,0:02:57.580
healing, deliverance, blessing, victory have come.

0:02:57.580,0:02:59.200
Yes.

0:02:59.200,0:03:01.960
That is why I can come out and pray.

0:03:01.960,0:03:05.020
I pray according to His will.

0:03:05.020,0:03:13.440
All you need now is to use your faith to receive them.

0:03:13.440,0:03:17.920
Faith does not originate from you and it does not originate from me.

0:03:17.920,0:03:23.100
It did not even originate from the apostles.

0:03:23.100,0:03:25.560
Faith originates from God.

0:03:25.560,0:03:27.160
We have faith.

0:03:27.160,0:03:33.520
Our faith increases because God possesses a nature.

0:03:33.520,0:03:35.400
I want to pray for you.

0:03:35.400,0:03:43.060
Receive the faith which God is prepared to give.

0:03:43.060,0:03:46.580
(Amen!)

0:03:46.580,0:03:53.820
This reminds me of what the demon-possessed boy's father said to Jesus,

0:03:53.820,0:03:58.900
"I believe, help my unbelief".

0:03:58.900,0:04:11.080
Receive the faith which God is prepared to give, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:04:11.080,0:04:14.520
(Amen!)

0:04:14.520,0:04:19.020
Thank You, Lord!

0:04:19.020,0:04:31.980
Receive the faith which God is prepared to give you, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:31.980,0:04:35.020
Yes, thank You, Lord.

0:04:35.020,0:04:46.160
Whatever wall between you and God, be removed in the name of Jesus!

0:04:46.160,0:04:49.840
(Amen!)

0:04:49.840,0:04:55.960
When there is a wall between you and God; how will you receive blessings?

0:04:55.960,0:05:03.840
He sent forth His Word and healed them.

0:05:03.840,0:05:09.260
He sent forth His Word and delivered them.

0:05:09.260,0:05:14.900
I command deliverance on you – be delivered, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:14.900,0:05:18.480
(Amen!)

0:05:18.480,0:05:37.760
Whatever wall, hindrance – wall could be your weakness, shortcoming, limitation, sin -

0:05:37.760,0:05:47.800
whatever wall between you and God, be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:47.800,0:06:07.640
Viewers, begin to confess that hindrance between you and God.

0:06:07.640,0:06:15.600
In the mighty name of Jesus, that wall, be removed!

0:06:15.600,0:06:24.560
that wall, be removed!

0:06:24.560,0:06:28.160
Yes - that wall, be removed.

0:06:28.160,0:06:30.280
That weakness, be removed.

0:06:30.280,0:06:32.340
That sin, be removed!

0:06:32.340,0:06:34.480
That limitation, be removed!

0:06:34.480,0:06:44.940
That wall, be removed, in Jesus Christ's name!

0:06:44.940,0:06:46.720
Yes.

0:06:46.720,0:06:49.740
The wall has been removed!

0:06:49.740,0:07:01.220
