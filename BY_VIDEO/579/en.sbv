Viewers all over the world, what God is about to do in your life -

0:00:06.240,0:00:08.680
hear from the Prophet:

0:00:08.680,0:00:19.640
I shall say that which I shall live to see happen!

0:00:21.600,0:00:27.740
Hear what God is about to do at this moment.

0:00:27.740,0:00:29.020
Are you ready to hear?

0:00:29.020,0:00:31.040
Yes.

0:00:31.040,0:00:37.360
I'm not praying for you; rather I'm telling you the will of God.

0:00:37.360,0:00:41.340
You will pray; I will tell you the will of God.

0:00:41.340,0:00:44.540
I will guide you.

0:00:44.540,0:00:48.360
Because prayer has language.

0:00:48.360,0:00:53.860
If you don’t speak the language, you are saying words.

0:00:53.860,0:00:58.500
But when you speak the language, you are praying prayer.

0:00:58.500,0:01:00.560
Tell your neighbour, "Prayer has language".

0:01:00.560,0:01:02.140
Prayer has language

0:01:02.140,0:01:09.100
If you don’t speak the language, you are saying words.

0:01:09.100,0:01:16.380
But when you speak the language, you are praying prayer.

0:01:16.380,0:01:17.120
Hallelujah.

0:01:17.120,0:01:18.380
Amen.

0:01:18.380,0:01:21.960
Wave you hands.

0:01:21.960,0:01:23.660
What is your situation?

0:01:23.660,0:01:31.740
I command you to be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:31.740,0:01:34.260
What is your situation?

0:01:34.260,0:01:37.660
Are you being demonized?

0:01:37.660,0:01:40.700
Are you not sure of yourself?

0:01:40.700,0:01:52.040
Are you facing generational curses, limitation in progress, hardship, poverty?

0:01:52.040,0:01:58.360
I command you to be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:58.360,0:02:01.380
Open your lips!

0:02:01.380,0:02:08.620
I said, "I command you to be released, in the name of Jesus!"

0:02:08.620,0:02:14.360
Open your lips and begin to say your situation.

0:02:14.360,0:02:17.860
Begin to speak out!

0:02:17.860,0:02:23.740
What are you facing?

0:02:23.740,0:02:27.080
What is your situation?

0:02:27.080,0:02:36.740
Your situation could be poverty, hardship, marital problems.

0:02:36.740,0:02:43.460
Are you demonized?

0:02:43.460,0:02:46.240
Are you sick?

0:02:46.240,0:02:54.340
Are you possessed by demons?

0:02:54.340,0:02:58.360
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:02:58.360,0:02:59.560
What is your situation?

0:02:59.560,0:03:06.340
I want you to mention your situation and say, enough is enough to that situation!

0:03:06.340,0:03:11.740
Say, "Enough is enough to that hardship!

0:03:11.740,0:03:16.680
Enough is enough to that sickness!

0:03:16.680,0:03:21.380
Enough is enough to that hardship!

0:03:44.740,0:03:48.980
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:03:48.980,0:03:58.960
Say after me, "Hardship – I face them no more!"

0:03:58.960,0:04:02.320
Begin to insert you situation there.

0:04:02.320,0:04:12.920
Whatever situation you are facing - sickness - I face them no more, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:12.920,0:04:18.080
Limitations in progress – I face them no more!
