0:00:00.040,0:00:04.740
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:04.740,0:00:08.360
Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Good Morning!"

0:00:08.360,0:00:11.800
Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:11.800,0:00:15.620
Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:15.620,0:00:19.600
Give your neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:19.600,0:00:24.280
Give your neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:24.280,0:00:33.540
Greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Good Morning!"

0:00:33.540,0:00:36.840
You are all welcome again in Jesus' name.

0:00:36.840,0:00:39.940
You may have your seats in the presence of God.

My name is Chris.

0:00:45.860,0:00:58.840
Before I begin today’s message, I want to first and foremost pay tribute to Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:58.840,0:01:07.440
who is a man I have the incredible privilege to call a mentor.

0:01:07.440,0:01:20.960
I came to Nigeria from the UK many, many years ago as a young boy seeking for Jesus

0:01:20.960,0:01:29.220
and Prophet T.B. Joshua showed me Jesus.

0:01:29.220,0:01:36.920
Not the Jesus of history, of story, of song, the baby Jesus. No!

0:01:36.920,0:01:50.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua showed me Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:01:50.440,0:02:06.880
He taught that the main requirements in making a difference for Jesus is being in love with Jesus.

0:02:06.880,0:02:14.440
This is what I see in Prophet T.B. Joshua – a man who loves Jesus

0:02:14.440,0:02:22.740
and has sacrificed and surrendered everything for his relationship with Jesus.

0:02:22.740,0:02:27.740
And that is why we are here today – because of his love.

0:02:27.740,0:02:34.820
He is a great man but his greatness lies not in great material achievements

0:02:34.820,0:02:37.820
or great acquisitions or great wealth.

0:02:37.820,0:02:49.700
No! His greatness lies in his great love for God.

0:02:49.700,0:02:56.020
Here I am today, a product of grace –

0:02:56.020,0:03:05.340
in many ways, still that same little boy who came here to serve a big God under a mighty prophet.

0:03:05.340,0:03:11.920
Thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:03:11.920,0:03:16.460
I want to ask you a question as we go into today's message.

0:03:16.460,0:03:20.400
Are you happy to be here today?

0:03:20.400,0:03:26.260
I'm not so sure. Let me ask again: Are you happy to be here today?

0:03:26.260,0:03:30.660
If you are happy, I would like you to turn to your neighbour and just give them a smile.

0:03:30.660,0:03:37.060
Camera, just move around and let's pick them very beautiful smiles.

0:03:37.060,0:03:41.520
Just smile at your neighbour. Give them a smile.

0:03:41.520,0:03:50.320
Just smile at your neighbour because it is a thing of joy to be here in the presence of God

0:03:50.320,0:03:57.220
and I pray that your joy will remain, in Jesus‘ name.

0:03:57.220,0:03:59.480
I want to tell you a very short story

0:03:59.480,0:04:05.980
in relation to the message God has given me to deliver to you today.

0:04:05.980,0:04:14.160
I’m sure people of this generation, our '‚www.com generation' may relate well to this story.

0:04:14.160,0:04:15.740
I will just tell you what I saw.

0:04:15.740,0:04:17.860
This was several months ago when I was back in the UK.

0:04:17.860,0:04:24.720
I was sitting on a train and I saw two young ladies.

0:04:24.720,0:04:32.320
Just by their look, by their appearance, you could see that they were depressed.

0:04:32.320,0:04:36.180
They were sad; they were moody.

0:04:36.180,0:04:40.540
Just name it. It was so obvious.

0:04:40.540,0:04:44.180
Everything about them suggested sadness.

0:04:44.180,0:04:48.520
These were two ladies you could see who were not materially lacking.

0:04:48.520,0:04:51.540
They were using the latest phone, the latest gadget.

0:04:51.540,0:04:56.400
They were well looked after but they were sad; they were depressed.

0:04:56.400,0:04:59.680
I was overhearing their conversation and I was feeling in my heart,

0:04:59.680,0:05:06.100
God look at these two young ladies in their early 20’s, late teenage years.

0:05:06.100,0:05:11.640
They had their whole life before them but they were so depressed.

0:05:11.640,0:05:18.200
You look at our generation today, you see sadness, depression has spread like wildfire,

0:05:18.200,0:05:20.440
especially among young people.

0:05:20.440,0:05:25.780
You hear the way in which suicide rates are increasing. It is alarming.

0:05:25.780,0:05:28.400
Tell your neighbour, "It is alarming".

0:05:28.400,0:05:33.080
As I was watching these two young ladies – I was there going on a journey –

0:05:33.080,0:05:37.980
I was looking at these two young ladies and I saw something that shocked me.

0:05:37.980,0:05:40.700
It was very surprising.

0:05:40.700,0:05:43.440
These were two people that looked extremely sad.

0:05:43.440,0:05:47.580
I won't be able to show that expression because...

0:05:47.580,0:05:50.960
Can anyone here just give me a sad face?

0:05:50.960,0:05:52.480
I'm sorry; I know we have just been happy.

0:05:52.480,0:05:55.620
Can someone give me a sad face?

0:05:55.620,0:05:57.440
Just for a moment.

0:05:57.440,0:06:00.040
Alright. Our gentleman here looks a little bit sad.

0:06:00.040,0:06:02.960
Now just imagine...

0:06:02.960,0:06:04.420
Don't smile, sir.

0:06:04.420,0:06:07.680
Just imagine that you see someone looking sad.

0:06:07.680,0:06:13.040
Suddenly, one of them got out their phone and wanted to take a photo, a selfie.

0:06:13.040,0:06:14.580
Take a picture of yourself.

0:06:14.580,0:06:20.100
These are the people that are depressed, weighed down, clearly anxious, sad.

0:06:20.100,0:06:27.760
But suddenly, when they want to take the picture, you should see the smile on their face.

0:06:27.760,0:06:36.020
And then, you know the funny thing: Immediately after, they were sad again.

0:06:36.020,0:06:40.120
It was mind-boggling, "What is going on?"

0:06:40.120,0:06:42.740
And do you know the painful part of this?

0:06:42.740,0:06:47.800
They will put this picture on Instagram, Facebook, send it to their boyfriends.

0:06:47.800,0:06:51.320
People would think that they were happy; people would think that they were okay.

0:06:51.320,0:07:00.400
People would think that they were joyful whereas in reality, they were depressed.

0:07:00.400,0:07:04.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:04.260,0:07:11.740
Please keep praying for this generation because we are living a fake life.

0:07:11.740,0:07:19.600
Our joy is for a moment. Our happiness is for a second.

0:07:19.600,0:07:29.100
We so often seem to have happiness or joy dependent on our circumstance, dependent on our situation.

0:07:29.100,0:07:31.160
That is when we see that happiness.

0:07:31.160,0:07:33.160
But I want to ask you a question.

0:07:33.160,0:07:35.580
Please, I am not here to make judgement on those two young ladies.

0:07:35.580,0:07:37.420
I pray that God will touch their hearts.

0:07:37.420,0:07:41.920
I just want to ask everyone here a question.

0:07:41.920,0:07:52.080
When you finish your day’s work, you go home and it is time for you to sleep.

0:07:52.080,0:07:58.800
You had a long day, you are tired and you lay back down on your bed.

0:07:58.800,0:08:03.320
And it is just you and God.

0:08:03.320,0:08:07.020
The lights are off. The doors are closed.

0:08:07.020,0:08:10.880
The activities of the day have come to a halt.

0:08:10.880,0:08:21.460
You are there laying on your bed, reflecting, thinking.

0:08:21.460,0:08:29.440
At that moment, do you have joy?

0:08:29.440,0:08:32.440
You are looking up at the ceiling.

0:08:32.440,0:08:35.400
There is no one there – just you.

0:08:35.400,0:08:40.960
At that moment, do you have joy?

0:08:40.960,0:08:48.780
Can you laugh without anyone cracking a joke, dance without anyone beating a drum?

0:08:48.780,0:08:55.440
Or at that moment, do you feel empty?

0:08:55.440,0:08:58.700
The reason why I’m asking this question today:

0:08:58.700,0:09:16.600
I am here to warn you about the dangers of sadness.

0:09:16.600,0:09:29.680
Whenever you are sad, the devil is at work.

0:09:29.680,0:09:34.000
A sad heart is the devil’s workshop.

0:09:34.000,0:09:36.160
He can manoeuvre, he can manipulate,

0:09:36.160,0:09:40.360
he can sow his seeds of chaos, destruction, division, discord.

0:09:40.360,0:09:47.380
He has free reign and rule in your heart as far as you are sad.

0:09:47.380,0:09:56.600
When you harbour sadness in your heart, you filter everything through it.

0:09:56.600,0:10:04.320
When you are sad, you can abandon jobs, quit relationships –

0:10:04.320,0:10:08.960
you don’t give your best; you live below your potential.

0:10:08.960,0:10:11.860
You begin to nurse suspicions.

0:10:11.860,0:10:14.640
You read meanings into people’s actions and inactions.

0:10:14.640,0:10:17.220
If someone greets you today, you say, "Why are they greeting me?"

0:10:17.220,0:10:22.220
If someone does not greet you, you say, "Why are they not greeting me?"

0:10:22.220,0:10:25.120
Whether they are greeting or not greeting, you read meaning into it.

0:10:25.120,0:10:29.320
You are suspicious; everyone becomes a suspect because your heart is sad.

0:10:29.320,0:10:33.300
You can’t pray. A sad heart can’t pray.

0:10:33.300,0:10:36.600
You may say words but you’re not praying prayer.

0:10:36.600,0:10:43.740
People around you may hear you but you’re talking to the air; God doesn’t hear you.

0:10:43.740,0:10:51.460
Your heart is sad.

0:10:51.460,0:10:59.700
Whenever you are sad, the devil is at work.

0:10:59.700,0:11:07.380
When you are sad, you begin to view yourself as a victim.

0:11:07.380,0:11:10.140
„Why is this happening to me?

0:11:10.140,0:11:14.920
Why am I the one facing this? Why me? Where is God?

0:11:14.920,0:11:22.580
Look at this person – God has blessed him, why not me? Me, me, me, I, I, I, why, why, why?“

0:11:22.580,0:11:36.180
Focusing on ourselves is the effective instrument used by the devil to blind us from reality.

0:11:36.180,0:11:39.320
Do you know what the reality is, children of God?

0:11:39.320,0:11:45.320
The reality is, Jesus is the anchor of our souls

0:11:45.320,0:11:52.000
and when you remain anchored on Him, attached to Him, connected to Him,

0:11:52.000,0:11:58.480
no matter how unsteady your life appears to be, you will remain steady.

0:11:58.480,0:12:00.840
Satan knows this.

0:12:00.840,0:12:02.760
So, what’s going to happen?

0:12:02.760,0:12:06.600
Satan will fight you tooth and nail.

0:12:06.600,0:12:12.840
He will use every weapon at his disposal to try and detach you from Jesus,

0:12:12.840,0:12:18.200
to try and disconnect you from Jesus because remaining attached to Jesus –

0:12:18.200,0:12:26.620
that is where our safety lies, that is where our security lies, that is where our protection lies.

0:12:26.620,0:12:34.260
Unhappiness is the weapon satan is using to detach us from Jesus.

0:12:34.260,0:12:45.180
This brings us to the title of today’s message: CHEER UP AND CHOOSE JOY.

0:12:45.180,0:12:50.940
Tell your neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".

0:12:50.940,0:12:55.800
Tell your other neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".

0:12:55.800,0:13:03.340
Let us turn to our Bible to the Book of John 15:11.

0:13:03.340,0:13:07.480
This is our Lord Jesus Christ speaking to His disciples.

0:13:07.480,0:13:23.200
"I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.“

0:13:23.200,0:13:29.120
For our joy to be complete, it must be God’s joy.

0:13:29.120,0:13:32.920
Joy is something only believers have.

0:13:32.920,0:13:37.040
The world may have happiness they find in their environment.

0:13:37.040,0:13:38.940
Just like those two young ladies.

0:13:38.940,0:13:42.540
They were happy for a moment and back to sadness.

0:13:42.540,0:13:45.260
Joyful for a moment - back to depression.

0:13:45.260,0:13:46.660
That is the world.

0:13:46.660,0:13:52.980
If your happiness is created by the flesh, it will be interrupted by the flesh.

0:13:52.980,0:13:58.480
If you say, "Let me create happiness for myself, I will do this.

0:13:58.480,0:14:04.900
Let me drink alcohol“ – the effects of alcohol will soon wear off. Back again.

0:14:04.900,0:14:09.540
You say to yourself, "Let me read this book, this novel, this fantasy“.

0:14:09.540,0:14:13.020
You get lost in another world, forgetting about your troubles.

0:14:13.020,0:14:15.120
The book will soon end.

0:14:15.120,0:14:21.600
You watch a film, a soap opera. You watch and you are happy at that moment.

0:14:21.600,0:14:25.120
The film will come to an end – back to reality.

0:14:25.120,0:14:31.600
Happiness you create for yourself can’t last; it cannot stand the test of time.

0:14:31.600,0:14:41.340
Joy is something only believers have because joy is a fruit of faith.

0:14:41.340,0:14:43.960
Let’s turn to another scripture.

0:14:43.960,0:15:13.860
Philippians 4:4: "Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!“

0:15:13.860,0:15:20.240
Does it say there that you should rejoice sometimes, at your convenient time,

0:15:20.240,0:15:29.080
when there is money in your pocket, when there is food on the table, when you take a picture?

0:15:29.080,0:15:34.040
No, rejoice in the Lord always.

0:15:34.040,0:15:37.920
Check yourself.

0:15:37.920,0:15:49.980
Whenever our joy seeps out and leaves us barren and empty,

0:15:49.980,0:15:58.440
it proves we are out of contact with God, out of fellowship with God.

0:15:58.440,0:16:04.700
You begin to see your joy gradually leaving, disappearing, seeping away.

0:16:04.700,0:16:13.300
It shows something has happened that has detached you from Jesus – sadness, unhappiness.

0:16:13.300,0:16:16.540
This is exactly what satan wants.

0:16:16.540,0:16:25.420
Satan’s main aim in tempting people of God is to overthrow their position as children of God,

0:16:25.420,0:16:31.500
to cut off their dependence on Him, their duty to Him, their communion with Him.

0:16:31.500,0:16:36.520
Satan delights in inflicting pain on people

0:16:36.520,0:16:40.760
because he knows that pain may likely separate you from God,

0:16:40.760,0:16:47.980
rob you of your joy, rob you of your happiness – that is the devil’s tactic.

0:16:47.980,0:16:51.680
Just take time to think about your life.

0:16:51.680,0:16:58.000
Any time good news has come, satan will send you some bad news.

0:16:58.000,0:17:01.580
Am I talking to someone here? You can check yourself.

0:17:01.580,0:17:04.680
Any time there is joy, something wonderful has happened,

0:17:04.680,0:17:08.060
satan will quickly send someone to give you some bad news.

0:17:08.060,0:17:13.480
He will send you a text message, give you a phone call that will try and scatter your joy.

0:17:13.480,0:17:16.540
For many of us, it happened coming to church this morning.

0:17:16.540,0:17:20.700
We are on the way to church, happy, joyful, it is going to be a wonderful service.

0:17:20.700,0:17:23.120
Suddenly, the phone just rings.

0:17:23.120,0:17:24.560
"What happened?"

0:17:24.560,0:17:28.740
"Oga, one of your vehicles is spoilt on the road.

0:17:28.740,0:17:31.200
The vehicle is a write-off."

0:17:31.200,0:17:35.280
You say, "Oh my God! I'm on my way to church.

0:17:35.280,0:17:38.200
The vehicle is spoilt. What is going on?

0:17:38.200,0:17:40.540
God, do you know I'm coming to worship you?

0:17:40.540,0:17:43.680
I'm coming to T.B. Joshua. You go and spoil my vehicle?

0:17:43.680,0:17:45.420
Which kind of nonsense is this?"

0:17:45.420,0:17:48.240
Many of you will turn back and not even come to church.

0:17:48.240,0:17:50.800
Some of you will come to church and as you are sitting down,

0:17:50.800,0:17:53.540
you are busy plotting revenge.

0:17:53.540,0:17:56.540
The sermon is going on but you are not listening.

0:17:56.540,0:17:59.800
You think, "How am I going to pay for this? How am I going to take care of this?

0:17:59.800,0:18:02.940
That driver who was in that vehicle - I'm going to deal with him!

0:18:02.940,0:18:05.980
Just let the church service come to an end so that I finish it!"

0:18:05.980,0:18:07.960
And you are in the church!

0:18:07.960,0:18:13.360
Sadness has taken over.

0:18:13.360,0:18:22.080
Any time there is happiness, there is joy, there is peace, satan will try and send some bad news.

0:18:22.080,0:18:24.740
Just imagine - you heard prophecies here.

0:18:24.740,0:18:29.860
Husband and wife looking for a child for so many years - suddenly the pregnancy comes.

0:18:29.860,0:18:33.220
There is rejoicing in the home, there is happiness, joy.

0:18:33.220,0:18:37.360
Suddenly, a text message comes in from an anonymous person.

0:18:37.360,0:18:41.060
"I saw your wife at the club last month with a man.

0:18:41.060,0:18:45.760
Are you sure that baby is yours?"

0:18:45.760,0:18:49.560
They never sent that text message when your wife was not pregnant.

0:18:49.560,0:18:54.020
Why now when there is joy, peace, rejoicing?

0:18:54.020,0:18:57.980
Suddenly, someone will try to inflict pain.

0:18:57.980,0:19:00.740
Someone will try to bring bad news.

0:19:00.740,0:19:07.220
The problem is, so often we make it easy for the devil – we take what we hear without questioning.

0:19:07.220,0:19:12.460
You take that text message and say, "Yes, this my wife; she has committed adultery.

0:19:12.460,0:19:15.640
She is this" - you don't even examine to know whether it is true.

0:19:15.640,0:19:17.460
You just believe.

0:19:17.460,0:19:29.420
Many divine marriages have been scattered because of sadness.

0:19:29.420,0:19:33.700
Many divine appointments - you are on your way to an appointment

0:19:33.700,0:19:36.640
that is going to change your life, rewrite your history.

0:19:36.640,0:19:39.400
Satan knows. He will send you bad news.

0:19:39.400,0:19:44.740
He will send you bad information to try and discourage you, to try and dishearten you.

0:19:44.740,0:19:51.860
And many of us give up at the peak of breakthrough.

0:19:51.860,0:20:00.600
Tell your neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".

0:20:00.600,0:20:08.000
I want to try and practically demonstrate to you the dangers of sadness.

0:20:08.000,0:20:10.680
Can I have one volunteer?

0:20:10.680,0:20:13.460
Ok, thank you, sir.

0:20:13.460,0:20:18.100
Sir, I'm very sorry. You are Mr Sadness.

0:20:18.100,0:20:19.220
Yes, I am.

0:20:19.220,0:20:25.340
Now, to behave like Mr Sadness, you need to...

0:20:25.340,0:20:28.680
I think he is getting it. A little bit more sad, sir.

0:20:28.680,0:20:31.200
Thank you. Let's clap for Mr Sadness.

0:20:31.200,0:20:33.020
Just for a moment.

0:20:33.020,0:20:36.200
Mr Sadness, can you just quickly help me to go to the back.

0:20:36.200,0:20:43.100
There is an item there that you are going to make use of for this demonstration.

0:20:43.100,0:20:46.640
I just need a couple of chairs and table.

0:20:46.640,0:20:48.880
Thank you very much.

0:20:48.880,0:20:59.760
I just want to try and practicalise this so that people can understand the danger of sadness.

0:20:59.760,0:21:06.980
We don’t know – when we are allowing sadness into our heart, we are allowing destruction.

0:21:06.980,0:21:13.500
This is my house. Just for this example.

0:21:13.500,0:21:16.600
When I say my house, I mean my heart.

0:21:16.600,0:21:20.460
Tell your neighbour, "Your heart".

0:21:20.460,0:21:23.240
Remember, the real part about you is your heart.

0:21:23.240,0:21:30.160
Take care of your heart. This is the most important part of us, our heart.

0:21:30.160,0:21:38.100
God never promised that situations would not come. Where did you read it in the Bible?

0:21:38.100,0:21:45.840
This doctrine of no suffering, no health challenges, no hardship, is not in line with the Bible.

0:21:45.840,0:21:47.500
It is not scriptural.

0:21:47.500,0:21:50.360
Where did you read that as a Christian, you can’t face challenges,

0:21:50.360,0:21:52.680
you can’t face difficulty, you can’t have bad news?

0:21:52.680,0:21:58.220
No! They come but we overcome.

0:21:58.220,0:22:03.400
Who told you that you would not have trouble? That is not scriptural.

0:22:03.400,0:22:08.240
Here I am. I am busy, sitting in my house.

0:22:08.240,0:22:11.680
Having a great day - there is joy, peace and happiness.

0:22:11.680,0:22:15.240
Suddenly, the phone rings.

0:22:15.240,0:22:18.420
There are some bad news.

0:22:18.420,0:22:22.900
"Dad, you have got to come quickly. Mum is so sick!“

0:22:22.900,0:22:25.780
"What? I just left her now. She was fine. What happened?“

0:22:25.780,0:22:31.680
"She is really really sick. Please make sure you come as soon as possible.“

0:22:31.680,0:22:37.140
Someone you left just yesterday, gone on a business trip and then they say that someone is sick.

0:22:37.140,0:22:39.940
Someone is crying; your heart is troubled.

0:22:39.940,0:22:44.080
At that moment, Mr Sadness comes in.

0:22:44.080,0:22:46.800
Come.

0:22:46.800,0:22:50.420
Look. I just had some bad news.

0:22:50.420,0:22:51.820
[Knocking.]

0:22:51.820,0:22:56.160
What does sadness do? It knocks at the door of your heart.

0:22:56.160,0:23:04.860
The question is: Will you open?

0:23:04.860,0:23:06.260
[Knocking.]

0:23:06.260,0:23:09.160
It knocks on the door. What will you do?

0:23:09.160,0:23:11.400
Will you let him in?

0:23:11.400,0:23:16.380
Now, in this example, I'm troubled, worried and Mr Sadness knocks.

0:23:16.380,0:23:25.860
"Oh, Mr Sadness, come in. Have a seat. Make yourself at home.“

0:23:25.860,0:23:31.500
Look. Mr Sadness did not come alone. He brought some items.

0:23:31.500,0:23:33.140
He brought some luggage.

0:23:33.140,0:23:39.500
So far as you make 'Mr Sadness' feel welcome, he will begin to relax in your heart.

0:23:39.500,0:23:44.980
He will begin to be relaxed and feel as if it is his own home.

0:23:44.980,0:23:52.520
As he does that, the items in his suitcase, he will begin to bring them out.

0:23:52.520,0:23:56.740
Alright. Just bring out some of these items, Mr Sadness.

0:23:56.740,0:23:57.960
Alright.

0:23:57.960,0:24:10.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:10.740,0:24:13.280
Look. There are some more items there.

0:24:13.280,0:24:19.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:19.780,0:24:23.080
I want you to take a lesson from this.

0:24:23.080,0:24:39.320
The moment you allow sadness into your heart, he will begin the work of destruction.

0:24:39.320,0:24:41.400
Let me also be clear with you.

0:24:41.400,0:24:46.460
When sadness checks in, joy checks out.

0:24:46.460,0:24:49.820
The two cannot be in the same house. They are opposite.

0:24:49.820,0:24:56.760
There I am busy worrying about my wife that is sick; I'm troubled.

0:24:56.760,0:25:02.860
And before you know it, sadness starts dropping in some soap of strife,

0:25:02.860,0:25:10.500
toothpaste of past pain, shampoo of shame.

0:25:10.500,0:25:19.260
I’m not thinking about this, I’m busy worrying about my problem and Mr Sadness has started to infiltrate.

0:25:19.260,0:25:24.800
He started to deposit his evil companions.

0:25:24.800,0:25:29.220
And I don’t even know; I’m busy being sad, worrying, depressed.

0:25:29.220,0:25:39.600
Before you know it, shame, malice, greed, bitterness, cruelty

0:25:39.600,0:25:43.580
because you allowed sadness into your heart.

0:25:43.580,0:25:48.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:48.640,0:25:51.840
Now, this is the painful part.

0:25:51.840,0:25:55.100
Most of us Christians come to our senses eventually.

0:25:55.100,0:25:59.140
Perhaps you are there and you suddenly remember a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:25:59.140,0:26:03.760
talking about the need for you not to focus on your situation but to focus on Jesus.

0:26:03.760,0:26:08.460
Suddenly it is as if your eyes open – you look and say, "What is this guy doing here?

0:26:08.460,0:26:13.300
Who let you into this house? Get out! Go!"

0:26:13.300,0:26:19.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:19.460,0:26:30.860
Now Mr Sadness has left but he has dropped his toothpaste.

0:26:30.860,0:26:33.040
Do you know what happens?

0:26:33.040,0:26:38.900
The next day, maybe it is time for you to brush your teeth.

0:26:38.900,0:26:41.800
You had a long day; you start brushing your teeth.

0:26:41.800,0:26:46.800
"Oh my God, I’m using the toothpaste of past pain!“

0:26:46.800,0:26:50.740
Sadness is gone but you are still using his products.

0:26:50.740,0:26:59.500
There is the journal of jealousy, the deodorant of discord – you are busy using it.

0:26:59.500,0:27:05.140
You don't know that you use something that contaminates your spirit.

0:27:05.140,0:27:17.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:17.760,0:27:25.600
Let me take a bit of water to flush it down.

0:27:25.600,0:27:29.800
Bitterness – I have taken the water of bitterness!

0:27:29.800,0:27:38.740
Because I have kicked sadness out but he has left his products.

0:27:38.740,0:27:46.260
At this point, sadness has been in your heart and he has rigged his destruction, caused this mess.

0:27:46.260,0:27:52.400
You now need to start cleaning up, "Jesus, have mercy on me“.

0:27:52.400,0:27:56.920
You start repairing what has been damaged, "All of this trouble; no, it is not part of me!"

0:27:56.920,0:27:59.620
"Jealousy, I’m a child of God. What has jealousy got to do with me?“

0:27:59.620,0:28:02.240
"What is this discord? It has nothing to do with me!"

0:28:02.240,0:28:10.180
You throw everything away and start afresh.

0:28:10.180,0:28:15.440
"This bag is no longer part of me!“ Throw it away.

0:28:15.440,0:28:23.000
Your house is clean. Your heart is clean and free again.

0:28:23.000,0:28:27.480
Do you know what happens next?

0:28:27.480,0:28:36.740
"Brother, this thing is serious. The company has gone bankrupt. Your shares have all been lost.“

0:28:36.740,0:28:42.360
"Eh!"

0:28:42.360,0:28:45.140
"Not again! God, why?"

0:28:45.140,0:28:46.900
Do you know what happens at that moment?

0:28:46.900,0:28:49.060
There is a visitor that will approach.

0:28:49.060,0:28:54.180
A visitor will come who wants to start knocking once again.

0:28:54.180,0:29:00.560
"Oh God! I have invested so much in that company. What is going on?“

0:29:00.560,0:29:01.980
[Knocking.]

0:29:01.980,0:29:03.600
"Who is that?"

0:29:03.600,0:29:05.140
"Sadness."

0:29:05.140,0:29:09.560
"Wait a minute! Isn’t this the guy I just kicked out?

0:29:09.560,0:29:17.200
Isn’t this the guy that polluted my house and caused such a mess, chaos and destruction?

0:29:17.200,0:29:19.640
Isn't this the same guy?"

0:29:19.640,0:29:21.220
But do you know what many of us do?

0:29:21.220,0:29:27.200
"Oh, come on in, sir. Have a seat. Come on in, sadness.“

0:29:27.200,0:29:35.420
And now, he has brought another bag.

0:29:35.420,0:29:39.180
Let us put our hands together for Mr Sadness.

0:29:39.180,0:29:47.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:47.420,0:29:51.420
Mr Sadness, please come with me. I think we need to make you happy.

0:29:51.420,0:29:55.480
I think it is time to give you a new name; let's replace sadness with joy.

0:29:55.480,0:29:59.580
Come and take one of the altar fruits.

0:29:59.580,0:30:03.720
Yes, the sadness has gone now.

0:30:03.720,0:30:07.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:07.700,0:30:09.520
Thank you very much, my brother. You may have your seat.

0:30:09.520,0:30:15.060
Let us put our hands together for Jesus.

0:30:15.060,0:30:21.200
I want you to reflect on this example.

0:30:21.200,0:30:31.760
The cycle of life seems to go on because any time trouble comes, sadness comes back in.

0:30:31.760,0:30:37.380
He starts doing his damage, causing his destruction, wreaking his havoc.

0:30:37.380,0:30:42.200
When we allow him straight back in, anything we have done to repair the damage,

0:30:42.200,0:30:46.180
we ask Jesus, "Come and remove this", we have repaired, removed all of this bitterness,

0:30:46.180,0:30:51.860
removed the strife and past pain and then you invite him back in.

0:30:51.860,0:31:12.620
Does it not call for concern that we are so welcoming of something so destructive?

0:31:12.620,0:31:20.260
You know the damage that has been done; yet, you allow him straight back in.

0:31:20.260,0:31:24.040
Those items 'Mr Sadness‘ brought, I’m not referring to physical items

0:31:24.040,0:31:27.320
I’m referring to thoughts, suggestions.

0:31:27.320,0:31:31.520
By the time sadness is in your heart, you will see it will come with bitterness.

0:31:31.520,0:31:33.820
Sadness is in your heart – anger.

0:31:33.820,0:31:36.660
Sadness is in your heart – suggestion of pride.

0:31:36.660,0:31:45.880
Sadness is in your heart – suggestion of envy, malice, jealousy, things that are contrary to Jesus.

0:31:45.880,0:31:59.220
I want to give you a secret today – any time satan wants you to cry, begin to laugh.

0:31:59.220,0:32:09.800
This is the greatest embarrassment you can give to satan – to ignore his existence.

0:32:09.800,0:32:13.300
He comes with his bad news. You don’t even pay attention.

0:32:13.300,0:32:17.460
Nothing interrupts your joy; nothing disturbs your peace

0:32:17.460,0:32:21.180
because you know that when satan comes with bad news,

0:32:21.180,0:32:25.420
he is simply informing you of the promotion that is coming.

0:32:25.420,0:32:29.580
In the face of promotion, why is there need for sadness?

0:32:29.580,0:32:32.360
Where is sadness in overcoming and triumph?

0:32:32.360,0:32:37.780
When you know that what you are passing through will lead to your promotion, why are you sad?

0:32:37.780,0:32:42.480
Tell your neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".

0:32:42.480,0:32:46.060
There is a story in the Bible we know so well. I want to remind you of it.

0:32:46.060,0:32:48.640
The story of Paul and Silas.

0:32:48.640,0:32:54.940
Acts 16:25. They were beaten and imprisoned unjustly for the cause of Christ.

0:32:54.940,0:32:57.420
There they were in their prison cell at midnight

0:32:57.420,0:33:06.160
and the Bible says they began to sing hymns and pray to God and the other prisoners were listening.

0:33:06.160,0:33:14.540
Just consider the circumstances under which Paul and Silas began to sing and praise God.

0:33:14.540,0:33:16.720
They had been beaten unjustly.

0:33:16.720,0:33:18.920
They were doing the work of God.

0:33:18.920,0:33:22.140
Paul had just delivered that slave girl from the spirit disturbing her.

0:33:22.140,0:33:25.980
They had committed no crime and yet they found themselves in prison.

0:33:25.980,0:33:31.600
In the deepest, darkest, deadliest of dungeons.

0:33:31.600,0:33:38.680
If it was me or you, we would begin to remind God of how long we have been a Christian.

0:33:38.680,0:33:41.880
"God, I have been a member of this church for ten years!

0:33:41.880,0:33:45.320
Do you know how much tithe I have given?

0:33:45.320,0:33:47.860
Do you know how much offering I have given?

0:33:47.860,0:33:54.480
Do you know how many times I have fasted and prayed? Is this how you repay me?"

0:33:54.480,0:33:58.500
Sadness.

0:33:58.500,0:34:05.140
Paul and Silas were in prison physically but their hearts were free.

0:34:05.140,0:34:06.760
They praised God.

0:34:06.760,0:34:16.940
Satan may succeed in inflicting you with pain but don’t let him pain your heart.

0:34:16.940,0:34:26.000
He may succeed in tampering with your business, causing some financial challenges.

0:34:26.000,0:34:29.360
Don’t let him tamper with your heart.

0:34:29.360,0:34:37.000
Satan may succeed in imprisoning you; you may end up in prison for what you know nothing about.

0:34:37.000,0:34:43.080
Don’t let him imprison your spirit, your heart.

0:34:43.080,0:34:47.960
Take a leaf from Paul and Silas and in the face of life’s challenges,

0:34:47.960,0:34:53.640
life's bad news, life’s ups and downs, begin to sing and praise God.

0:34:53.640,0:34:56.540
Choose the bright colours of praise

0:34:56.540,0:35:03.660
rather than the dark colours of doubt, discouragement and depression.

0:35:03.660,0:35:08.780
I'm going to round up but I want to share with you a very personal expereince

0:35:08.780,0:35:14.260
that solidified and strengthened my faith to give such a message.

0:35:14.260,0:35:16.820
It was over 10 years ago.

0:35:16.820,0:35:23.020
This is an incidence that many of us that are new to Emmanuel TV might not be familiar with.

0:35:23.020,0:35:27.900
But if you have been in this church for many years, you will be aware of what happened.

0:35:27.900,0:35:35.760
Many years, over 10 years ago, Emmanuel TV was new, fresh, changing lives, nations and the world.

0:35:35.760,0:35:40.440
One day after the service on Sunday, it was in the early hours of Monday morning.

0:35:40.440,0:35:43.180
Around 2 to 3 am, we were all here in the church.

0:35:43.180,0:35:46.860
Suddenly came the alarm. I remember it very vividly.

0:35:46.860,0:35:52.740
Someone came to my bed and hit me and said, "There is fire!“

0:35:52.740,0:35:57.040
Everyone was scattered; there was pandemonium, worry, panic.

0:35:57.040,0:35:58.520
We rushed down.

0:35:58.520,0:36:08.200
The church console, the control room, the heart of Emmanuel TV was in flames.

0:36:08.200,0:36:20.280
Everyone started running up and down, getting water, trying to reduce the flames.

0:36:20.280,0:36:26.960
I was worried. At that moment, sadness had entered my heart.

0:36:26.960,0:36:28.660
I was distressed.

0:36:28.660,0:36:36.800
"God, this is equipment worth millions. What is going on? How could this happen?“

0:36:36.800,0:36:43.660
As everyone was busy, rushing to do this or that, I remember this so well –

0:36:43.660,0:36:47.580
I heard someone laughing and I was provoked.

0:36:47.580,0:36:59.460
"How can you laugh! This situation does not call for laughter, joy! This is a serious situation!“

0:36:59.460,0:37:04.700
The same person I heard laughing was asking people, „How are you?“, smiling and greeting people.

0:37:04.700,0:37:12.220
I looked round and I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:37:12.220,0:37:16.640
He came to me, gave me a big smile and said, „How are you?“

0:37:16.640,0:37:21.440
I didn’t say anything.

0:37:21.440,0:37:23.920
I was shocked.

0:37:23.920,0:37:27.300
The situation on the ground did not call for that.

0:37:27.300,0:37:30.500
He was so relaxed, so joyful.

0:37:30.500,0:37:34.620
He was even calling people, "Make sure you bring a camera to camera it“.

0:37:34.620,0:37:43.640
"What? You have just lost equipment worth millions! Oh my God!

0:37:43.640,0:37:45.860
There was joy.

0:37:45.860,0:37:53.300
By the grace of God, everything was resolved; the fire didn’t spread anywhere else.

0:37:53.300,0:38:00.260
Afterwards, that morning, Prophet T.B. Joshua gathered all the evangelists and workers that were there

0:38:00.260,0:38:09.580
and said, "God allowed this and I knew it would happen“.

0:38:09.580,0:38:19.220
He said, "Out of these ashes will shine forth beauty“.

0:38:19.220,0:38:26.460
Today, our control room is ten times better than the one that was lost.

0:38:26.460,0:38:28.120
Why am I saying this, brethren?

0:38:28.120,0:38:32.940
This personal experience, example in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:38:32.940,0:38:36.340
I do not know what you are passing through right now.

0:38:36.340,0:38:41.120
Viewers, I don’t know what situation you are in.

0:38:41.120,0:38:43.180
Perhaps your marriage is on fire.

0:38:43.180,0:38:45.180
Perhaps your business is on fire.

0:38:45.180,0:38:47.180
Perhaps your finances are on fire.

0:38:47.180,0:38:55.300
One thing I do know, as a Christian, out of those ashes, beauty will come.

0:38:55.300,0:38:58.020
If you can just glimpse the bigger picture.

0:38:58.020,0:39:01.240
Beyond that trial, there is triumph.

0:39:01.240,0:39:04.840
Beyond that scar, there is a star.

0:39:04.840,0:39:10.820
Beyond that mess is a message.

0:39:10.820,0:39:13.960
If we could just catch the bigger picture.

0:39:13.960,0:39:19.560
Beyond that painful story is beautiful glory.

0:39:19.560,0:39:27.480
As a child of God, where then is sadness?

0:39:27.480,0:39:35.920
Why do we so easily give our hearts to sadness, depression, unhappiness as Christians?

0:39:35.920,0:39:49.640
In John 16:33 Jesus said, "In this world, you will have trouble but cheer up; take heart.

0:39:49.640,0:39:53.200
Choose joy because you will overcome“.

0:39:53.200,0:39:55.900
Brethren, let me not deceive you.

0:39:55.900,0:40:00.900
Trouble will come but you will overcome.

0:40:00.900,0:40:06.620
Sickness will come but you will overcome.

0:40:06.620,0:40:11.460
Hardship will come but you will overcome.

0:40:11.460,0:40:17.120
Stop trading your joy for your situation.

0:40:17.120,0:40:24.700
Don’t let anything rob you of joy – joy is our conquering power.

0:40:24.700,0:40:30.400
The joy of the Lord is our strength (Nehemiah 8:10).

0:40:30.400,0:40:36.340
Affliction may test me as a man of faith but it cannot rob me of my joy.

0:40:36.340,0:40:41.300
Trouble may test me as a man of faith but it cannot rob me of my joy

0:40:41.300,0:40:48.700
and when I cheer up and choose joy, my test will turn into a testimony.

0:40:48.700,0:41:01.900
I don’t know what tomorrow holds but I know who holds tomorrow.

0:41:01.900,0:41:17.840
Rejoice because the higher Hand that is leading you, is leading you to something higher.

0:41:17.840,0:41:25.400
May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus‘ name.
