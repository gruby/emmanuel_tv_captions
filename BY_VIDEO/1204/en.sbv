GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING

0:00:04.000,0:00:12.040
On Sunday 22nd May 2016, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a word of prophecy

0:00:12.040,0:00:17.520
concerning the state of politics, especially in Africa.

0:00:17.520,0:00:19.600
Let us hear from him.

0:00:19.600,0:00:22.780
Let me now come to the politics here.

0:00:22.780,0:00:28.140
African leaders should quickly arrest the political situation.

0:00:28.140,0:00:31.760
Politics will not be business as usual.

0:00:31.760,0:00:34.660
You know, everybody wants to be a politician.

0:00:34.660,0:00:37.960
You run to this because of money; you invest your money on it.

0:00:37.960,0:00:47.120
It's not going to work like that - unless you are called to the job.

0:00:47.120,0:00:51.020
When you are called, you cannot resist; you cannot say, "No".

0:00:51.020,0:00:55.300
If God calls you to run, you cannot stop running.

0:00:55.300,0:00:59.300
If it is your calling to run, you will find yourself running.

0:00:59.300,0:01:01.220
You are not going to run because of money

0:01:01.220,0:01:04.560
but because of love for it, you are called for it.

0:01:04.560,0:01:07.200
So, it's not business as usual.

0:01:07.200,0:01:13.940
Whatever you spend in elections, it will only earn you good name;

0:01:13.940,0:01:17.020
you cannot get any profit from it.

0:01:17.020,0:01:23.360
If you collect money and expect to return it back, you cannot get it returned.

0:01:23.360,0:01:25.000
So, therefore, it's not business again.
