0:00:00.000,0:00:03.340
My name is Lucky Susu.

0:00:03.340,0:00:06.640
This is my first time to come to this church.

0:00:06.640,0:00:09.420
I was released from prison.

0:00:09.420,0:00:16.300
I want to thank God for what He has done in my life.

0:00:16.300,0:00:18.500
It happened like this:

0:00:18.500,0:00:24.040
I am wheelbarrow pusher in my market.

0:00:24.040,0:00:27.800
When people have a load to carry, I will carry it for them to the bus stop.

0:00:27.800,0:00:32.740
Some people will give me 100 naira, some will give me 150 or 200 naira.

0:00:32.740,0:00:41.660
In 2008, on the 9th of December, I brought two bags of rice and some tubers of yam to the bus stop.

0:00:41.660,0:00:45.120
Across the tarmac, they were some people gathered.

0:00:45.120,0:00:47.920
I crossed to see what was happening.

0:00:47.920,0:00:51.280
There was an old woman on the ground who a motor vehicle had hit.

0:00:51.280,0:00:52.540
She was bleeding.

0:00:52.540,0:00:56.380
I began to shout, that the people should rush to help this woman.

0:00:56.380,0:01:00.120
They said that the vehicle that had hit the woman had driven away

0:01:00.120,0:01:03.160
and said, "Don't you know, this is Lagos".

0:01:03.160,0:01:08.140
I felt for the woman and decided to try and save her life.

0:01:08.140,0:01:12.860
I took the money that I had suffered for to help my family

0:01:12.860,0:01:17.520
to take the woman in a taxi to hospital in Agota.

0:01:17.520,0:01:21.540
We reached the hospital but the woman died in the hospital.

0:01:21.540,0:01:26.040
Then, the doctor called the police and they arrested me.

0:01:26.040,0:01:28.660
They charged me with murder.

0:01:28.660,0:01:33.820
Last week, a man came to the prison on Friday.

0:01:33.820,0:01:45.280
When he came, he was wearing a Faith Bracelet on his wrist from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:45.280,0:01:51.600
I explained to the man that I did not steal or kill but they still kept me there.

0:01:51.600,0:01:54.600
I asked him to keep me in his prayers.

0:01:54.600,0:02:01.280
The man said that the Faith Bracelet he was wearing was from The SCOAN

0:02:01.280,0:02:03.220
and that I should hold his hand.

0:02:03.220,0:02:07.120
One of the 15 people I have given to.

0:02:07.120,0:02:09.040
The person quickly called me.

0:02:09.040,0:02:11.040
The Faith Bracelet

0:02:11.040,0:02:15.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:15.160,0:02:20.900
You'll see the wise men - they are always wearing and praying with it.

0:02:20.900,0:02:23.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:23.680,0:02:27.340
We call it Faith Bracelet.

0:02:27.340,0:02:28.920
You count your faith.

0:02:28.920,0:02:33.960
If I am not here now, I am busy with it.

0:02:33.960,0:02:36.460
If I am inside the vehicle, if I am sitting down like you -

0:02:36.460,0:02:39.080
if I were the one sitting down now, I would be busy with it.

0:02:39.080,0:02:41.260
You would see me sitting down busy with it.

0:02:41.260,0:02:45.060
While talking to you, the divine nature of me is busy.

0:02:45.060,0:02:51.860
While Mr T.B. Joshua is talking to you, the divine nature will be busy counting faith.

0:02:51.860,0:02:56.040
Because a break in faith is a break in God.

0:02:56.040,0:03:01.760
That time, I was in the maximum security prison, at Ikoyi.

0:03:01.760,0:03:05.940
Then, they transferred me to another place

0:03:05.940,0:03:12.040
where they keep robbery suspects waiting for judgement.

0:03:12.040,0:03:18.460
My mind was telling me that the same thing would happen to me.

0:03:18.460,0:03:24.900
A prayer came to my mind, "God of T.B. Joshua, if You are really alive..."

0:03:24.900,0:03:27.220
- I was holding the Faith Bracelet.

0:03:27.220,0:03:34.200
"If You are really alive and You work, remove me from the problem I am in

0:03:34.200,0:03:36.380
because I am innocent".

0:03:36.380,0:03:41.440
When I finished the prayer, I waited until evening before I slept

0:03:41.440,0:03:44.400
and prayed the same prayer again.

0:03:44.400,0:03:50.560
That night when I slept, the man of God appeared to me in a dream.

0:03:50.560,0:03:57.020
He spoke to me and said, "My Child, God has heard your cry and you are innocent".

0:03:57.020,0:03:59.960
He said that I should keep on doing the good that I used to do and

0:03:59.960,0:04:02.660
that I should not resign myself to suffering.

0:04:02.660,0:04:04.760
He said I would go home the next day.

0:04:04.760,0:04:09.620
That was on Tuesday night, going to Wednesday morning last week.

0:04:09.620,0:04:14.980
At around after 3 am, before it reached 4 am,

0:04:14.980,0:04:19.240
I heard my name at the gate: "Susu".

0:04:19.240,0:04:22.760
My mind was telling me that they wanted to take me to kill me;

0:04:22.760,0:04:26.900
so, I went to hide in the lavatory and began to cry.

0:04:26.900,0:04:32.980
They came and dragged me outside and then said that I had no case to answer.

0:04:32.980,0:04:44.860
Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:44.860,0:04:52.200
After they left me when we got outside, I walked towards Oshodi.

0:04:52.200,0:04:59.180
When I arrived there, I explained myself to a woman who gave me 150 naira.

0:04:59.180,0:05:06.280
I collected the money, kept it and then used it to get here this morning.

0:05:06.280,0:05:10.800
When I reached here, I was wearing the clothes I wore in the prison.

0:05:10.800,0:05:13.320
They are here, inside this bag.

0:05:13.320,0:05:15.600
They are the clothes I was wearing while in prison.

0:05:15.600,0:05:19.100
I arrived here and asked them to allow me to enter the church but they refused.

0:05:19.100,0:05:23.260
I asked them if I could join the people under the canopy

0:05:23.260,0:05:25.120
but they didn't allow me to enter there.

0:05:25.120,0:05:28.220
Let's see the clothes you wore here from prison.

0:05:28.220,0:05:40.040
Lucky Susu
Faith Bracelet Testimony

0:05:40.040,0:05:49.660
The clothes are here as well as the slippers I was wearing.

0:05:49.660,0:05:52.780
After I got here and they did not allow me to enter,

0:05:52.780,0:05:58.480
I went to sit down by that red gate outside and began to cry.

0:05:58.480,0:06:03.500
As I was crying, this morning, a man approached me and asked me why I was crying.

0:06:03.500,0:06:05.460
I explained my situation to him.

0:06:05.460,0:06:08.000
The man asked me to follow him which I did.

0:06:08.000,0:06:12.400
He took me through the red gate.

0:06:12.400,0:06:16.340
He give me soap and water and told me not to cry anymore.

0:06:16.340,0:06:19.480
He told me to shower and took me to the bathroom.

0:06:19.480,0:06:23.360
When I finished showering, I wanted to put on the same trousers

0:06:23.360,0:06:26.360
when a man who was there told me that the man that brought me

0:06:26.360,0:06:29.440
had said that I should wait for him in the bathroom.

0:06:29.440,0:06:34.140
I waited and before 15 minutes were over, the man came.

0:06:34.140,0:06:37.440
He had gone to buy me new trousers, a new shirt and new sandals.

0:06:37.440,0:06:39.100
- The same man?
- Yes.

0:06:39.100,0:06:41.640
- Do you know the man?
- No.

0:06:41.640,0:06:44.100
- But if you see him, you will know him?
- Yes.

0:06:44.100,0:06:46.060
You will go and look for him.

0:06:46.060,0:06:49.600
The man then gave me 500 naira which is in my hand now.

0:06:49.600,0:06:56.100
He said I should put it in my pocket, that I shouldn't be left without any money.

0:06:56.100,0:07:00.300
He said I should hold it in case I wanted to buy anything.

0:07:00.300,0:07:02.440
Did you listen to what he said?

0:07:02.440,0:07:07.720
He said he was just coming from prison with those dirty wears.

0:07:07.720,0:07:11.700
On getting here, no one wanted to reckon with him.

0:07:11.700,0:07:13.720
They asked him to go and stay outside.

0:07:13.720,0:07:16.720
Suddenly a man just came and said, "Ah, what happened?

0:07:16.720,0:07:18.480
Why are you looking like that? Are you mental?"

0:07:18.480,0:07:19.980
He said, "No, I'm from prison".

0:07:19.980,0:07:25.880
The man took him, bought him a soap, took him to the bathroom,

0:07:25.880,0:07:32.640
bathed him, got him money, bought new clothes for him, gave him money and

0:07:32.640,0:07:34.780
carried him inside the church.

0:07:34.780,0:07:36.500
I think this man needs to be encouraged.

0:07:36.500,0:07:39.080
I don't know the man but we need to see the man.

0:07:39.080,0:07:45.980
He said while he was in the prison, last week, a man just walked into the prison.

0:07:45.980,0:07:54.640
He didn''t know whether he was one of the wardens or one of the preachers that preached to the prisoners.

0:07:54.640,0:07:57.280
He just encountered the man.

0:07:57.280,0:08:01.640
The man said, "Oh, what happened? Why are sitting quietly in dejection?"

0:08:01.640,0:08:05.360
He was able to narrate the story to the man,

0:08:05.360,0:08:09.040
"This is the reason why I am in here. I am innocent".

0:08:09.040,0:08:15.700
And the man said, "Yes. This bracelet with me, I want you to pray with me.

0:08:15.700,0:08:18.500
Let me remove it and put it on your hand and pray with you.

0:08:18.500,0:08:20.820
Just ask for your release.

0:08:20.820,0:08:25.320
Ask God to reveal to the authority the cause of your stay here.

0:08:25.320,0:08:29.120
Why you are here, so that they can know the truth. You will be released".

0:08:29.120,0:08:33.700
He removed it, wore it, prayed with the man and immediately...

0:08:33.700,0:08:38.920
He said that night after the prayer, he saw a vision

0:08:38.920,0:08:43.520
and a man came to him and said, "Look, you will be released".

0:08:43.520,0:08:48.520
The second day, he said the authority came and they called his name out.

0:08:48.520,0:08:50.380
That was how he was released.

0:08:50.380,0:08:54.180
And immediately he was released, he had to come to The Synagogue,

0:08:54.180,0:08:56.620
to come and share this testimony.

0:08:56.620,0:09:01.580
"Hey, I've never been to The Synagogue. I don't know a place called Synagogue."

0:09:01.580,0:09:05.120
But immediately he was released, he asked people around, "Where is The Synagogue?"

0:09:05.120,0:09:08.660
But the man that gave the bracelet could not wait; he just had to leave

0:09:08.660,0:09:14.540
because I know the man is going around everywhere to deliver people with the message.

0:09:14.540,0:09:19.220
Ok, maybe the man will be seeing it on Emmanuel TV now that this man is out.

0:09:19.220,0:09:20.920
So now he came here.

0:09:20.920,0:09:26.280
On getting here, with the uniform he wore in front of the church,

0:09:26.280,0:09:29.580
people were running from him because he looked tattered.

0:09:29.580,0:09:32.860
Somebody just came and said, "Look, why are you standing somewhere?

0:09:32.860,0:09:35.380
Are you mental? Do you want to go to the emergency?"

0:09:35.380,0:09:37.440
That was how the man rescued the situation.

0:09:37.440,0:09:44.360
Got him money to buy soap, took him to the bathroom, washed him,

0:09:44.360,0:09:47.960
got him new clothes, gave him money for feeding.

0:09:47.960,0:09:49.980
Can you go and look for the man, please.

0:09:49.980,0:09:53.160
Take him out and look for the man. Bring the man forward.

0:09:53.160,0:09:57.040
Please, he said he doesn't know the man  but when he sees the man, he will know.

0:09:57.040,0:09:58.700
Let us see the man.

0:09:58.700,0:10:02.160
Wow! So we can still see a good Samaritan like this.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:08.720,0:10:19.900
If God is aware of your situation, your situation will not kill you but prepare you.

0:10:19.900,0:10:24.800
Tell your neighbour: If God is aware of your challenges

0:10:24.800,0:10:31.580
your challenges will not destroy you but prepare you.

0:10:31.580,0:10:37.620
Your challenges could be imprisonment; they could be temptation of any kind.

0:10:37.620,0:10:50.360
Such a situation may be allowed to strengthen your desire and your determination for God.

0:10:50.360,0:10:55.520
If God is involved, who else is involved does not matter.

0:10:55.520,0:11:03.300
Tell your neighbour: If God is involved, who else is involved does not matter.

0:11:03.300,0:11:10.020
So brother, continue your goodness.

0:11:14.260,0:11:21.140
Rise up! Glory, glory!

0:11:21.140,0:11:23.220
Wow!

0:11:23.220,0:11:27.880
Is it the man? Glory be to God!

Mr Susu With The Man Who Helped Him

0:11:47.480,0:11:49.220
Who is this?

0:11:49.220,0:11:51.700
This is the man who bought the clothes for me.

0:11:51.700,0:11:54.100
- Is he the one that bought soap?
- Yes.

0:11:54.100,0:11:55.720
- Washed you?
- Yes.

0:11:55.720,0:11:57.160
- Gave you clothes?
- Yes.

0:11:57.160,0:11:59.160
- And gave you money?
- Yes.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:04.380,0:12:07.760
Brother, where did you see this man? Is he your brother?

0:12:07.760,0:12:11.540
No, sir. I saw him at the gate where he was crying.

0:12:11.540,0:12:18.100
He looked so dirty; so, I called him and listened to him.

0:12:18.100,0:12:22.120
I asked him, "Why are you like this?"

0:12:22.120,0:12:27.100
He told me that he was released last week from prison

0:12:27.100,0:12:33.020
and because of the way he looked, they didn't want him to enter the church.

0:12:33.020,0:12:37.480
I told him to follow me if that was the case.

0:12:37.480,0:12:49.460
I took him to the bathroom so he could shower and I got him a change of clothes.

0:12:49.460,0:12:52.380
- You bought him clothes?
- Yes, sir.

0:12:52.380,0:12:54.100
- You bought him soap?
- Yes, sir.

0:12:54.100,0:12:57.940
- And you waited there until he finished bathing?
- Yes, sir.

0:12:57.940,0:12:59.480
What else did you do?

0:12:59.480,0:13:03.800
I then brought him inside the church.

0:13:03.800,0:13:10.700
The Man Who Helped Mr Susu

0:13:10.700,0:13:15.740
What is your purpose of doing this?

0:13:15.740,0:13:28.400
Daddy we need to follow your footsteps.

0:13:28.400,0:13:36.260
He is one of the head of security - one of the head.

0:13:36.260,0:13:44.460
If this man has surplus and he is one of the head of security, he will do charity with it.

0:13:44.460,0:13:47.440
He will be giving the needy a lot.

0:13:47.440,0:13:54.620
Whilst he is doing the job there, he is giving out financial support.

0:13:54.620,0:14:00.520
Wow. We pray what you are doing now shall be permanent.

0:14:00.520,0:14:04.640
Ha. You might have been doing this because this one is too obvious

0:14:04.640,0:14:11.580
that is why we are aware of it. You might have been doing it for so long.

0:14:11.580,0:14:15.620
I know this man. It is true; in was in our market,

0:14:15.620,0:14:20.320
pushing a wheelbarrow for many years.

0:14:20.320,0:14:22.720
- You know who?
- I know this man.

0:14:22.720,0:14:25.660
He is very quiet. He would push a wheelbarrow.

0:14:25.660,0:14:28.560
If people bought a lot of items, he would help them to carry them.

0:14:28.560,0:14:32.620
For many years, I had not seen him; I thought he had relocated

0:14:32.620,0:14:35.520
and didn't know he was in prison.

0:14:35.520,0:14:38.900
You heard it from the woman coming out from the midst of the congregation,

0:14:38.900,0:14:42.500
testifying that what this man is saying is nothing but the truth.

0:14:42.500,0:14:45.960
In the same market that the man mentioned, at mile 12,

0:14:45.960,0:14:52.080
they knew him at the market as someone who pushed local trolleys to carry loads for people.

0:14:52.080,0:14:57.920
When they did not see him after some time, they thought he had relocated to another market,

0:14:57.920,0:15:00.440
not knowing that he was in prison.

0:15:00.440,0:15:05.540
We are still coming back to that. Let's settle the Good Samaritan.

0:15:05.540,0:15:11.320
What this security has done now is telling the gentleman that

0:15:11.320,0:15:14.400
he should not stop doing good.

0:15:14.400,0:15:17.880
Because of what has happened to him, he should not stop.

0:15:17.880,0:15:27.500
Don't stop doing good because God is aware of what happened to him.

0:15:27.500,0:15:29.940
Let's talk about this man first.

0:15:29.940,0:15:34.320
Because what he did now - assume he had not taken effort to buy this, to buy that,

0:15:34.320,0:15:38.140
to clothe the man, to get him to the bathroom and wash him,

0:15:38.140,0:15:42.920
there is no way we can see this man today.

0:15:42.920,0:15:44.920
He would not be able to come inside.

0:15:44.920,0:15:51.460
We would not be able to talk today about this man's predicament and the lesson we learnt.

0:15:51.460,0:15:57.420
I think for your charity, the ministry has to begin to establish people like this.

0:15:57.420,0:16:02.940
What we are even planning to do: Instead of our ministry to be doing it,

0:16:02.940,0:16:09.780
we want to have a kind of apostolic people.

0:16:09.780,0:16:15.180
If you are one of the apostolic, whatever the ministry can give you,

0:16:15.180,0:16:22.420
you will also be doing charity and every year we assess how far you have gone in charity.

0:16:22.420,0:16:27.080
The ministry can also be giving you money, some fund to be doing your charity there.

0:16:27.080,0:16:30.120
I think this man should be given 5 million to be starting the charity.

The 'Good Samaritan' To Receive 5 Million Naira For Works Of Charity

0:16:36.900,0:16:45.540
They should immediately because of position, the area where what he is doing there as a security;

0:16:45.540,0:16:47.960
there are many sick people that could not come.

0:16:47.960,0:16:52.780
There are many sick people when they get here, they are too sick; they cannot come in.

0:16:52.780,0:16:56.540
Some people, after the healing, they don't have money to go home.

0:16:56.540,0:17:02.920
Not of all them can reach us but the security there, he is there to quickly help them.

0:17:02.920,0:17:10.460
Immediately, get that cheque written and let him give testimony and let the world see.

0:17:10.460,0:17:13.260
5 million naira.

And not only that - we want to know, you that has been doing charity, where are you living?

0:17:24.280,0:17:27.540
Are you leaving comfortably?

0:17:27.540,0:17:29.300
I am very happy.

0:17:29.300,0:17:35.900
We people of God are very happy to see a man like this in the house of God, working for God.

0:17:35.900,0:17:39.200
Not working for his pocket.

0:17:39.200,0:17:40.840
Wonderful.

0:17:40.840,0:17:45.940
All over the world, we want to have you over there.

0:17:45.940,0:17:52.280
If you are into charity, what can we do to support you and to showcase your case to the world?

0:17:52.280,0:17:56.900
I can be visiting you all over the world when you want to launch this charity.

0:17:56.900,0:18:01.660
We want to do it in a big way - scholarship given to deserving children,

0:18:01.660,0:18:07.040
supporting the widows and help the needy all over the world

0:18:07.040,0:18:11.320
and giving scholarships to the best candidates that deserve it.

0:18:11.320,0:18:13.780
Yes, rescue them.

0:18:13.780,0:18:17.760
Little kidnapped children, rescue them.

0:18:17.760,0:18:20.660
Go all the way to help mankind.

0:18:20.660,0:18:22.160
So that is it.

0:18:22.160,0:18:25.820
If you don't let this man know that it is good to do good,

0:18:25.820,0:18:32.500
irrespective of what comes, he will not do good again because he has seen pain,

0:18:32.500,0:18:39.480
affliction in doing good but we are saying, "No, no. Nothing can break me.

0:18:39.480,0:18:42.780
Nothing can separate me from doing good".

0:18:42.780,0:18:44.300
Stand up and tell your neighbour:

0:18:44.300,0:18:49.780
Nothing can separate me from doing good.

0:18:49.780,0:18:53.660
Can affliction?

0:18:53.660,0:18:55.660
Condemnation?

0:18:55.660,0:18:57.640
Even death?

0:18:57.640,0:19:01.540
What can separate you from doing good?

0:19:01.540,0:19:08.940
Say, nothing!

Many, when they begin to recast their experiences in doing good in the past,

0:19:22.900,0:19:26.240
they will tell you that they will never do good again.

0:19:26.240,0:19:29.900
No, nothing can separate me from doing good.

0:19:29.900,0:19:36.200
Can affliction, poverty, imprisonment, infirmity?

0:19:36.200,0:19:42.740
Nothing can separate me because Jesus is good all the time.

0:19:42.740,0:19:54.780
Now brother, continue doing good until death.

I want to look at the picture of what has happened to our security personnel out there.

0:20:30.140,0:20:37.140
This is a similar thing that has happened, and I know revelation is coming.

0:20:37.140,0:20:40.000
I want to appreciate what they are doing.

0:20:40.000,0:20:45.820
This brother came here to prove to you that, 'Look, there is Godliness in them.

0:20:45.820,0:20:49.600
There is care, there is love'.

0:20:49.600,0:20:51.400
Please support them.

0:20:51.400,0:20:56.960
Any time you come, try to understand that they have many people to attend to.

0:20:56.960,0:21:00.920
Don't begin to look at them, don't just talk to them anyhow.

0:21:00.920,0:21:02.700
You have to be patient.

0:21:02.700,0:21:09.980
They need patience, endurance and perseverance from you.

0:21:09.980,0:21:16.320
You have to persevere and be patient because they attend to thousands of people.

0:21:16.320,0:21:21.640
It's not only you. If you just come to them, be patient.

0:21:21.640,0:21:26.640
Don't be in a hurry. If you are in a hurry meeting them, you may find them very tough.

0:21:26.640,0:21:28.380
It's nature.

0:21:28.380,0:21:30.440
Appreciate what they are doing.

0:21:30.440,0:21:35.340
This is one out of thousands that is going on.

0:21:35.340,0:21:38.480
They are many; they have done a lot.

0:21:38.480,0:21:43.420
So please, my message to you once again:

0:21:43.420,0:21:48.820
What you have passed through is as it should be by divine will.

0:21:48.820,0:21:52.300

0:21:52.300,0:22:00.460
They were not to destroy or kill you but to prepare you.

0:22:00.460,0:22:09.860
Look at where you are today.

0:22:09.860,0:22:11.860
Take this message from me.

0:22:11.860,0:22:13.000
Tell your neighbour:

0:22:13.000,0:22:23.460
What you are passing through is as it should be by divine will.

0:22:23.460,0:22:40.980
They are not to kill or destroy you but to prepare you for the challenges ahead.

0:22:40.980,0:22:47.640
Ask any great leader, they will tell you what they went through.

0:22:47.640,0:22:58.820
Read about the apostles in the Bible - you will see clearly that they saw darkness.

0:22:58.820,0:23:07.880
That was why they were able to maintain the good day they had that made them apostles.

0:23:07.880,0:23:11.180
Experience is the best teacher.

0:23:11.180,0:23:13.660

Opposite is the case now. What you were expecting - for the prophet to give to someone

0:23:21.460,0:23:26.220
who is testifying of prison is now given to a Good Samaritan.

0:23:26.220,0:23:28.420
What does that mean to you?

0:23:28.420,0:23:31.260
It means, there is a journey ahead.

0:23:31.260,0:23:34.020
He still has some journey to pass through

0:23:34.020,0:23:39.060
before he begins to experience that comfort he is expecting.

0:23:39.060,0:23:42.640
He said he was pushing the trolley.

0:23:42.640,0:23:45.840
I was pushing the trolley in the past.

0:23:45.840,0:23:49.200
The market he is talking about, I was there in the past.

0:23:49.200,0:23:53.700
Those who have read some story about me...

0:23:53.700,0:24:03.920
It was in the midst of all this that the Lord took me to the place where He could use me.

0:24:12.480,0:24:18.740
You have seen during the service that the man of God addressed the issue of the brother

0:24:18.740,0:24:23.220
that was in the post of security service, helping the needy.

0:24:23.220,0:24:26.320
They meet thousands of these people during the course of their duty.

0:24:26.320,0:24:30.820
People in need come to the security post asking for help.

0:24:30.820,0:24:35.020
We saw the good work he did today by helping that man who was stranded.

0:24:35.020,0:24:38.940
And the man of God said live that he has taken the promise

0:24:38.940,0:24:43.720
to bless this man with this cheque of 5 million naira

0:24:43.720,0:24:50.360
to encourage him, to support him to go and do the good work.

0:24:50.360,0:24:54.580
The Bible says, the works of charity and works of righteousness go together.

0:24:54.580,0:25:00.320
When the man of God saw that, now he encourages this brother by giving him as he promised

0:25:00.320,0:25:04.420
that cheque of 5 million naira to encourage him to go and do the good work

0:25:04.420,0:25:07.580
in the ministry of charity to help the needy.

0:25:07.580,0:25:08.860
