Viewers, the message about Africa: No African country can succeed alone.

0:00:14.240,0:00:20.040
African countries need each other to succeed.

0:00:20.040,0:00:28.780
Dear Africa, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.

0:00:28.780,0:00:32.520
Africa unite!

0:00:32.520,0:00:36.120
Let us pray viewers all over the world.

0:00:36.120,0:00:40.520
Stretch your hand towards the screen.

0:00:40.520,0:00:47.440
Wherever you are under the influence of my voice -

0:00:47.440,0:00:54.960
right now, I say to that infirmity, I say to that sickness:

0:00:54.960,0:00:58.320
let the power of God come down!

0:00:58.320,0:01:05.620
Wherever the disease is located - in your blood, tendons, fluids and bones -

0:01:05.620,0:01:14.420
whatever name they call it - kidney problem - out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:14.420,0:01:18.220
I command them out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:18.220,0:01:24.020
Whatever situation you are in right now, with God all things are possible.

0:01:24.020,0:01:28.140
Never a sickness, never a burden Jesus cannot solve.

0:01:28.140,0:01:33.920
I command that situation - be surmounted, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:33.920,0:01:38.020
Be moved, in the name of Jesus! I command them out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:38.020,0:01:39.920
I say - out, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:39.920,0:01:47.700
That situation in your blood, fluids, tendons, kidney - whatever name they call it -

0:01:47.700,0:01:52.900
never a sickness Jesus cannot heal; never a disease Jesus cannot cure.

0:01:52.900,0:01:55.000
Be cured, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:55.000,0:02:04.100
Be healed, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:04.100,0:02:09.920

0:02:15.620,0:02:21.740
Let your story change! Yes, let your story change, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:02:21.740,0:02:25.500
With God, all things are possible -
just believe.

0:02:25.500,0:02:27.300
With God, all things are possible.

0:02:27.300,0:02:35.620

0:02:49.340,0:02:52.680
Great!
This is the voice of God.

0:02:52.680,0:02:58.300
I say to your career, whatever stage your career is - imbalanced, epileptic -

0:02:58.300,0:03:05.300
your business, your finances - I say, great, great, move, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:05.300,0:03:08.120

0:03:08.120,0:03:10.320
Dry bones shall rise again!

0:03:10.320,0:03:20.160
Your family, your marriage - be restored, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:20.160,0:03:25.840
I say to you, anywhere you are, whatever medium you are using to view us right now -

0:03:25.840,0:03:31.900
right now, just believe, in the name of Jesus, by faith -

0:03:31.900,0:03:38.320
you are healed, delivered and set free, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:38.320,0:03:42.400
I can't wait to hear your testimony!

0:03:42.400,0:03:49.220
Once again, Africa, Africa, Africa!

0:03:49.220,0:03:54.220
Africa has neglected her youth.

0:03:54.220,0:04:00.380
Africa has abandoned the youth to themselves.

0:04:00.380,0:04:06.120
Africa has failed to provide provision for her youth.

0:04:06.120,0:04:12.300
Anytime I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.

0:04:12.300,0:04:28.760
Everything looks gloomy, sunless, dark, darksome, shadowy and dull.

0:04:28.760,0:04:31.560
Africa, Africa!

0:04:31.560,0:04:37.880
Lord Jesus, we commit the nations of Africa into Your hands - redeem the nations,

0:04:37.880,0:04:41.760
redeem the continent of Africa, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:41.760,0:04:44.720
Redeem our leaders, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:44.720,0:04:49.320
Wherever there are troubled spots all over the world,

0:04:49.320,0:04:56.160
Father, Lord Jesus, come and rescue the nations.

0:04:56.160,0:05:00.320
All over the world, rescue the nations. There is trouble all over the world.

0:05:00.320,0:05:02.660
Father, we know with You, all things are possible.

0:05:02.660,0:05:07.040
We know with You, dry bones shall rise again.

0:05:07.040,0:05:11.800
Whatever pain, whatever area - the nations that are at war,

0:05:11.800,0:05:21.700
Father, Lord Jesus - be calm, let peace restore - unity!

0:05:21.700,0:05:24.940
I can hear breakthrough, in the name of Jesus.

0:05:24.940,0:05:27.760
Thank You, Lord!

0:05:27.760,0:05:29.980
I leave you in faith.

0:05:29.980,0:05:32.120
You will see me back in faith.

0:05:32.120,0:05:34.420
I shall meet you in faith. Thank you.
