Right now, those of us that are just coming to Christ for the first time and those of us who want to rededicate ourselves -

0:27:19.340,0:27:35.580
open your lips right now. Lord Jesus, wash me with Your precious blood.

0:27:35.580,0:27:47.060
Make me Your channel of shining light where there is darkness.

0:27:47.060,0:27:57.120
Make me Your channel of pardon where there is injury.

0:27:57.120,0:28:04.200
Make me Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.

0:28:04.200,0:28:16.700

A promise still standing. Out there, they need a channel of shining light.

As you are leaving, you are God's channel of love where there is hate.

Say: "I am God's channel of shining light where there is darkness."

0:29:35.040,0:29:43.420
As you are leaving, you are God's channel of forgiveness where there is sin.

0:29:43.420,0:29:47.740
God's channel of pardon where there is injury.

0:29:47.740,0:29:54.900
These are the promises right now you want to make. Remain quiet and silent and make this promise.

0:29:54.900,0:30:04.240
As a channel of God out there. Wherever you are - channel of God.

0:30:04.240,0:30:15.040
In the East - channel of God. South - channel of God. North, West - channel of God.

0:30:15.040,0:30:21.160
Where there is crisis - channel of God. Where there is disobedience - channel of God.

0:30:21.160,0:30:31.140
Where there is hate - channel of God. So this is promise you have to make now before you leave.

0:30:31.140,0:30:40.220
I am standing to tell you that old things pass away; God has renewed you.
