0:00:00.160,0:00:04.780
The real, authentic and forceful power of the most high God

0:00:04.780,0:00:08.000
exercises through the faculties of Wise Man Christopher

0:00:08.000,0:00:14.620
as he prays for all present in The SCOAN auditorium for the salvation of their souls.

0:00:14.620,0:00:19.460
Here is a stiff opposition - a demon that had been hiding in this body,

0:00:19.460,0:00:22.240
exposed by the light of God.

0:00:22.240,0:00:28.000
Let us watch how darkness has no hiding place in this encounter with Wise Man Christopher.

0:00:28.000,0:00:31.580
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:31.580,0:00:34.560
I am a simple spirit, just take it easy.

0:00:34.560,0:00:36.640
I am a gentleman, just take it easy.

0:00:36.640,0:00:39.200
Who are you in this body?

0:00:39.200,0:00:41.440
We are three.

0:00:41.440,0:00:43.960
Mention yourselves.

0:00:43.960,0:00:48.840
I am the queen of the coast, idol from his mother's house and idol from his father's house.

0:00:48.840,0:00:54.460
I can never leave this body because I love this man more than any other man.

0:00:54.460,0:00:56.340
But this is a man?

0:00:56.340,0:01:00.340
This person standing here is a man but I am a woman in him.

0:01:00.340,0:01:01.540
What are you doing in him?

0:01:01.540,0:01:04.220
He is my husband

0:01:04.220,0:01:10.980
As a wife, what have you done to this man, his career and his marriage?

0:01:10.980,0:01:15.060
This man you see here is a stupid man.

0:01:15.060,0:01:20.000
I told him not to have any affair with any woman,

0:01:20.000,0:01:23.520
that anything he wants in his life, I will give it to him.

0:01:23.520,0:01:27.760
He did not go to school; he only passed elementary 6

0:01:27.760,0:01:29.740
but he teaches in a secondary school.

0:01:29.740,0:01:32.100
I gave him brains.

0:01:32.100,0:01:37.200
If you see this man preaching, you will think that he is the one that wrote the Bible.

0:01:37.200,0:01:41.340
Since he cheated my love, he married a stupid woman.

0:01:41.340,0:01:42.640
Who is this stupid woman?

0:01:42.640,0:01:49.220
That woman - I am dragging him with that woman.

0:01:49.220,0:01:54.580
I told that woman that I would leave him for her but she must suffer.

0:01:54.580,0:01:57.520
There is somebody standing next to you, by your right.

0:01:57.520,0:01:59.660
Who is this woman to you?

0:01:59.660,0:02:02.040
I dont know her.

0:02:02.040,0:02:04.160
OK, let's find out from her. Madam, you are welcome.

0:02:04.160,0:02:05.200
Thank you, sir.

0:02:05.200,0:02:06.160
Who is this man to you?

0:02:06.160,0:02:07.300
He is my best.

0:02:07.300,0:02:09.940
It's a lie. I'm a pastor.

0:02:09.940,0:02:11.800
My husband - he is my best.

0:02:11.800,0:02:16.240
Tell her to go and look for her best. I'm not her best.

0:02:16.240,0:02:18.040
Madam, did you hear that?

0:02:18.040,0:02:24.360
Reverend Uche Ekeoma is my husband. We got married in 1990.

0:02:24.360,0:02:27.540
I wedded in 1978.

0:02:27.540,0:02:31.820
What is happening to her? What have you done so far to this marriage?

0:02:31.820,0:02:36.460
Sickness - she will suffer sickness very well in her life.

0:02:36.460,0:02:40.540
My name is Bianca, queen of the coast.

0:02:40.540,0:02:43.860
Every day, I stay with him, I always hear at night, "Bianca!"

0:02:43.860,0:02:46.640
He would be laughing and swimming on the bed.

0:02:46.640,0:02:49.020
Then I would wake up, put the light on, sit down

0:02:49.020,0:02:52.380
and ask him, "What is this? Who is this Bianca?" He would get annoyed with me.

0:02:52.380,0:02:55.600
The next thing he would do, if it was very early in the morning,

0:02:55.600,0:02:59.140
he would not take his bath; he would put on his clothes and go away.

0:02:59.140,0:03:02.720
For one year, I would not see him; I would look for him until I got him.

0:03:02.720,0:03:04.460
I have suffered.

0:03:04.460,0:03:09.560
Watch me and watch her. Who is more beautiful?

0:03:09.560,0:03:12.560
This is a man. Can a man be beautiful?

0:03:12.560,0:03:15.240
I am a woman, not a man.

0:03:15.240,0:03:26.660
Just look at me and this thing here. Then tell me who is more beautiful.

0:03:26.660,0:03:31.040
We wanted to come. I had been planning for this deliverance.

0:03:31.040,0:03:33.560
That morning, my elder sister gave me some money.

0:03:33.560,0:03:37.040
Other people and church members gave me up to 50,000 naira.

0:03:37.040,0:03:41.820
I then found myself in the hospital. My blood pressure was 300 --

0:03:41.820,0:03:43.860
I caused it.

0:03:43.860,0:03:50.680
I even took that money away. I just had mercy and she managed to go to hospital.

0:03:50.680,0:03:53.300
In that hospital, I should have killed her there.

0:03:53.300,0:03:57.800
You said that this man is a pastor; he preaches and calls the name Jesus.

0:03:57.800,0:04:00.640
How do you normally hide?

0:04:00.640,0:04:04.000
Sometimes, when I came to make love to him,

0:04:04.000,0:04:06.320
he would tell me, I am reading the Bible and praying.

0:04:06.320,0:04:12.040
This man could pray before but gradually, I swept everything out from him.

0:04:12.040,0:04:13.140
He cannot even pray well.

0:04:13.140,0:04:16.560
He cannot pray. Every night, I would quarrel with him.

0:04:16.560,0:04:19.020
Every morning, I would quarrel with him.

0:04:19.020,0:04:23.120
When I bring out my Bible to read, he would read and teach me what is in the Bible.

0:04:23.120,0:04:24.540
He would say, "Let me go and urinate".

0:04:24.540,0:04:27.760
Can a woman teach a woman the Bible?

0:04:27.760,0:04:31.620
Is it not a man that would teach a woman the Bible?

0:04:31.620,0:04:37.480
Ask her! Is it not a man, a pastor that would teach the members,

0:04:37.480,0:04:40.600
not a member to teach the pastor? Then why is she coming to me?

0:04:40.600,0:04:44.680
I am dragging one thing with her since she feels that I can teach her the Bible.

0:04:44.680,0:04:50.520
I cannot teach her the Bible because this man himself, he would throw the Bible away.

0:04:50.520,0:04:56.360
Right now, you demon, you can no longer hide.

0:04:56.360,0:05:00.080
I told you that I am a gentle spirit.

0:05:00.080,0:05:03.320
Don't release this fire because all your hand is fire, fire, fire!

0:05:03.320,0:05:09.920
As you are standing here - fire, fire, fire - and it is burning so high!

0:05:09.920,0:05:12.260
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:12.260,0:05:17.020
Come out of him! Out!

0:05:17.020,0:05:18.960
Out!

0:05:18.960,0:05:37.580
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:05:37.580,0:05:39.580
Out!

0:05:39.580,0:05:43.500
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:05:43.500,0:05:45.060
Out!

0:05:45.060,0:05:47.080
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:05:47.080,0:05:50.420
In Jesus' name. Amen.

0:05:50.420,0:05:53.920
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:05:53.920,0:05:56.560
Rise up! You are delivered.

0:05:56.560,0:06:14.460
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:06:14.460,0:06:17.620
How are you, sir?

0:06:17.620,0:06:20.380
I'm fine, sir.

0:06:20.380,0:06:23.960
Ah! Why am I here?

0:06:23.960,0:06:26.780
Come, sir.

0:06:26.780,0:06:29.280
But I wore a coat.

0:06:29.280,0:06:30.740
You wore what?

0:06:30.740,0:06:32.720
I wore a coat.

0:06:32.720,0:06:33.800
Who removed it?

0:06:33.800,0:06:34.780
She removed it.

0:06:34.780,0:06:35.900
Who is she?

0:06:35.900,0:06:37.060
She is my best.

0:06:37.060,0:06:38.140
Good.

0:06:38.140,0:06:40.460
Are you a man or a woman?

0:06:40.460,0:06:44.600
I am a man. A full fledged man.

0:06:44.600,0:06:46.500
Good.

0:06:46.500,0:06:51.880
Look around.

0:06:51.880,0:06:53.920
Whose cloth is this?

0:06:53.920,0:06:55.100
It is my coat.

0:06:55.100,0:06:56.260
Who removed it?

0:06:56.260,0:06:58.200
I don't know.

0:06:58.200,0:07:01.360
Put it on. It is yours.

0:07:01.360,0:07:02.920
Thank You, Jesus!

0:07:02.920,0:07:04.140
How are you now, sir?

0:07:04.140,0:07:07.320
Sir, I am very free; I am happy now.

0:07:07.320,0:07:11.720
You said that you are the queen of the coast.

0:07:11.720,0:07:14.480
And you titled your name, 'Bianca'.

0:07:14.480,0:07:18.820
I am Reverend Ekeoma Uche. I am not a woman.

0:07:18.820,0:07:21.700
And many other things you said you have done.

0:07:21.700,0:07:26.160
You have destroyed yourself, your ministry and your marriage.

0:07:26.160,0:07:28.240
That demon that spoke through you is out!

0:07:28.240,0:07:31.880
Thank You, Jesus!

0:07:31.880,0:07:34.920
So Madam, you should not use it against him,

0:07:34.920,0:07:37.880
just as you should not use what she has said against her.

0:07:37.880,0:07:40.280
Both of you are completely delivered by Jesus!

0:07:40.280,0:07:42.780
TESTIMONY TIME

0:07:42.780,0:07:50.740
My name is Pastor Ekoma Uche from Abia State, Nigeria.

0:07:50.740,0:07:58.360
The woman standing beside me is my best - Prophetess Omoze Uche.

0:07:58.360,0:08:07.540
I was born into a Christian family but my grandfather was a native doctor.

0:08:07.540,0:08:14.560
When I was born, my mother told me that I was very sick; we were twins.

0:08:14.560,0:08:24.980
Because of my sickness, they decided to take me here and there to find a way to rescue my life.

0:08:24.980,0:08:34.300
At the last place that they went to, the native doctor told them to throw me inside the river

0:08:34.300,0:08:39.500
and expect to receive me back, which they did.

0:08:39.500,0:08:46.100
After three days, as my mother told me, they came to the river bank,

0:08:46.100,0:08:50.520
picked me up and I became well.

0:08:50.520,0:08:58.160
As I was growing up, something began to manifest in my life,

0:08:58.160,0:09:07.500
telling me that I could not make it until I recognised I came from somewhere".

0:09:07.500,0:09:17.540
Then, the next thing I did was to become a born-again Christian but the spirit was still in me.

0:09:17.540,0:09:29.580
So, I decided to enter Bible School even though the spirit was still operating in me.

0:09:29.580,0:09:36.340
Then, one day, I came to Lagos because it was the time of my graduation.

0:09:36.340,0:09:43.360
As I was returning to Aba, in the park, I saw a lady.

0:09:43.360,0:09:53.440
She just rushed to me with her car and said she wanted to join me in this journey.

0:09:53.440,0:09:59.060
I said that there was no problem since there was a vacant seat available.

0:09:59.060,0:10:04.020
We started the journey. On the road, she bought so many things.

0:10:04.020,0:10:10.200
It was on the trip, as we were seated that she then told me

0:10:10.200,0:10:13.040
she wanted to introduce herself to me and I agreed.

0:10:13.040,0:10:17.560
She introduced herself as Bianca and said she wanted to be my wife.

0:10:17.560,0:10:18.500
I said, "Okay".

0:10:18.500,0:10:28.260
While on the journey, she bought me a necklace, wristwatch and a ring.

0:10:28.260,0:10:31.700
When we got to Aba and I was about to go to my house,

0:10:31.700,0:10:38.820
she insisted that she would like to pass the night with me and we slept together.

0:10:38.820,0:10:43.860
As we were sleeping, something tapped me and I woke up.

0:10:43.860,0:10:48.280
I looked at her, and she began to change colour.

0:10:48.280,0:10:52.700
I wanted to scream but she woke up and asked me what was happening.

0:10:52.700,0:10:54.720
I became afraid.

0:10:54.720,0:11:01.580
Then she said, as long as I had slept with her, she had initiated me

0:11:01.580,0:11:04.300
and we entered into a covenant.

0:11:04.300,0:11:08.540
You mean she changed to what? Was it at midnight?

0:11:08.540,0:11:10.140
It was at midnight.

0:11:10.140,0:11:12.220
Were the lights off?

0:11:12.220,0:11:15.320
The lights were switched off but something tapped me and I awoke.

0:11:15.320,0:11:18.560
I turned on the light and saw her---

0:11:18.560,0:11:20.960
Change to what? Tell us.

0:11:20.960,0:11:25.920
Her legs were in the form of a fish while her upper body was that of a human being.

0:11:25.920,0:11:29.920
I wanted to scream, and she changed automatically

0:11:29.920,0:11:31.980
because she knew somebody would come in.

0:11:31.980,0:11:37.060
Okay, question again. The house was your own house or a rented house?

0:11:37.060,0:11:38.840
We slept in a hotel.

0:11:38.840,0:11:40.700
So you paid for the hotel?

0:11:40.700,0:11:42.120
She paid the money.

0:11:42.120,0:11:43.280
She paid the money?

0:11:43.280,0:11:46.400
Yes, because I did not have the money to pay for the hotel.

0:11:46.400,0:11:48.800
Okay, who located that hotel?

0:11:48.800,0:11:53.700
She located the hotel, although she asked me if I knew any hotel there.

0:11:53.700,0:11:55.060
I said, "No".

0:11:55.060,0:11:57.340
Then, you were a pastor?

0:11:57.340,0:12:00.360
Yes, I was a student pastor then.

0:12:00.360,0:12:01.920
Okay, in theology school?

0:12:01.920,0:12:03.080
Yes, sir.

0:12:03.080,0:12:04.480
Okay.

0:12:04.480,0:12:10.380
After then, my life changed.

0:12:10.380,0:12:18.240
One thing she told me to be in the covenant was that I would never have another wife.

0:12:18.240,0:12:20.040
I said, "Okay".

0:12:20.040,0:12:26.860
She told me that anytime I married, I would surely face the repercussions.

0:12:26.860,0:12:35.960
This lady gave me a talent such that I didn't even know what I was doing.

0:12:35.960,0:12:40.260
I did not go to secondary school; I just passed Primary Six.

0:12:40.260,0:12:48.620
However, I teach in secondary school as if I have graduated from university.

0:12:48.620,0:12:54.180
The subjects I was teaching in secondary school were government, geography, CRK

0:12:54.180,0:12:56.220
and the Igbo language.

0:12:56.220,0:12:58.880
She used to teach me at night.

0:12:58.880,0:13:00.060
The lady?

0:13:00.060,0:13:01.000
Yes.

0:13:01.000,0:13:03.660
Without attending any school?

0:13:03.660,0:13:07.140
Without attending any school - she physically came to me

0:13:07.140,0:13:10.820
during my time of study and taught me those subjects.

0:13:10.820,0:13:14.940
God is looking for character, not gifts.

0:13:14.940,0:13:17.660
What do you understand about that?

0:13:17.660,0:13:28.680
Gifted people are more among the children of satan than the children of God.

0:13:28.680,0:13:37.860
Gifted are more among the children of satan than even the children of God.

0:13:37.860,0:13:42.240
He is looking for character, not gifts.

0:13:42.240,0:13:45.460
God's Word reflects His character.

0:13:45.460,0:13:49.720
You can be gifted without character.

0:13:49.720,0:13:54.800
But you cannot have a good character without a gift.

0:13:54.800,0:14:03.940
There is what we call supernatural gift and natural gift - talent.

0:14:03.940,0:14:05.220
Let's listen to him.

0:14:05.220,0:14:11.780
Although I was a pastor, I was also a teacher.

0:14:11.780,0:14:17.480
She used to come and teach me; then I would teach the students.

0:14:17.480,0:14:23.140
Nobody in Aba does not know me as a teacher and also a pastor.

0:14:23.140,0:14:25.820
I teach students very well.

0:14:25.820,0:14:32.840
They loved me but they did not know that something was behind the lessons.

0:14:32.840,0:14:37.660
During the examination periods; that is, WAEC time,

0:14:37.660,0:14:44.900
I registered them, took them to the examination centres and we wrote.

0:14:44.900,0:14:52.380
On the day of writing the exams, if you did not agree with me, you would suffer in the hall.

0:14:52.380,0:14:55.920
After which I would grade them, I would make love with them,

0:14:55.920,0:14:58.680
play with them and initiate them.

0:14:58.680,0:15:04.820
When the results would come out, those who did not accept my offer,

0:15:04.820,0:15:09.180
or those who did not agree to give me what I required or needed from them,

0:15:09.180,0:15:13.000
their results would surely be seized.

0:15:13.000,0:15:18.120
Some people accused the government for seizing the exams.

0:15:18.120,0:15:20.200
Are you the one that seized their results?

0:15:20.200,0:15:22.480
Spiritually.

0:15:22.480,0:15:25.320
Their results would be seized spiritually.

0:15:25.320,0:15:31.420
If you settled us, we would ask you to go to the internet,

0:15:31.420,0:15:35.740
make your mark and then you could get your results.

0:15:35.740,0:15:44.680
When you got your results, you would find it very difficult to get admission to university.

0:15:44.680,0:15:52.460
Even if you got admission, it would be a fake result because it was from the spiritual world.

0:15:52.460,0:15:56.860
Remember that I told you that I was a 'Christian' and a pastor at the same time.

0:15:56.860,0:16:01.080
I was using all these things as a cover up.

0:16:01.080,0:16:07.120
It is not all results that the government seizes; some are seized by demons,

0:16:07.120,0:16:12.000
which is the simplest way to initiate them when they come back to us.

0:16:12.000,0:16:16.720
Can I ask you a question? If a student is a Christian,

0:16:16.720,0:16:23.600
coming as a student to your school or sitting the WAEC exams -

0:16:23.600,0:16:27.520
because they are not all your students, some students come from outside -

0:16:27.520,0:16:32.300
and they are Christians, what would you do with that?

0:16:32.300,0:16:38.020
If you are a Christian and I took you to the examination centre,

0:16:38.020,0:16:41.620
you are not my problem because if I dare come near you,

0:16:41.620,0:16:52.000
the fire around you will surely scare us away.

0:16:52.000,0:16:57.820
The question now: How many students are Christians today?

0:16:57.820,0:17:12.260
Every 10 students, two; and every 20 students, four.

0:17:12.260,0:17:17.600
Can your children be among these just two?

0:17:17.600,0:17:24.500
Every 10 students, two are fire.

0:17:24.500,0:17:31.200
The rest can be captured.

0:17:31.200,0:17:35.820
I know if I give you a chance today, some of our 'mummy' and 'daddy',

0:17:35.820,0:17:43.000
they will come and swear Heaven and earth that their children are eating with Jesus.

0:17:43.000,0:17:46.340
What you don't know, your children know better than you.

0:17:46.340,0:17:51.580
You don't need to send them to school; the internet has taught them everything.

0:17:51.580,0:17:56.180
They will just sit at home and be looking at you.

0:17:56.180,0:17:58.820
Sometimes, when you are battling with the television at home,

0:17:58.820,0:18:01.900
to switch it on with the remote, they will be looking at you.

0:18:01.900,0:18:09.000
After you have suffered so much, they will say, "Mummy, don't worry".

0:18:09.000,0:18:13.120
At the beginning, they would not want you to know that they know these things.

0:18:13.120,0:18:17.040
They will allow you to battle with the television or laptop.

0:18:17.040,0:18:23.320
After you have battled, they will say, "Mummy, don't worry. I know what is happening to it".

0:18:23.320,0:18:31.080
Because they don't want you to suspect that they are more advanced than you.

0:18:31.080,0:18:37.180
You will be using a handset, you will have loaded it with credit - full.

0:18:37.180,0:18:39.800
Your own children will not one day buy credit.

0:18:39.800,0:18:44.280
They will be deducting your credit; they will be using it.

0:18:44.280,0:18:51.200
You keep buying credit, and they are the ones using it.

0:18:51.200,0:18:53.440
Are you with me?

0:18:53.440,0:18:58.380
You will continue to load your handset with credit everyday

0:18:58.380,0:19:01.700
because you do not know anything - you are a zombie.

0:19:01.700,0:19:06.880
You don't know anything because you are too busy with your job.

0:19:06.880,0:19:08.460
There is a level you can go.

0:19:08.460,0:19:12.240
You continue to load your handset with credit.

0:19:12.240,0:19:14.460
You buy a card, and there is nothing left.

0:19:14.460,0:19:20.100
But your children at home, they will not one day buy credit.

0:19:20.100,0:19:21.740
They will be deducting.

0:19:21.740,0:19:25.780
When they know that you are shouting, they will stop it for a short time.

0:19:25.780,0:19:31.600
When you say, "Ah, what is happening to MTN? Why are they cutting my credit?

0:19:31.600,0:19:34.100
They keep on eating my credit!"

0:19:34.100,0:19:40.160
You don't know that your children at home are the ones eating your credit.

0:19:40.160,0:19:47.400
At that time, I had a secret room; I had not yet married then.

0:19:47.400,0:19:57.480
When pastors had their meetings, I would not go out that day.

0:19:57.480,0:20:00.400
Nothing would move me to go out of my room

0:20:00.400,0:20:05.340
because it would be the day we would meet in the spiritual world.

0:20:05.340,0:20:13.000
I would lock myself up in the room turn into a cat.

0:20:13.000,0:20:16.560
I would lock the room from the inside so that nobody could open it.

0:20:16.560,0:20:22.020
If I forgot to lock the room and you came inside, whatever you saw,

0:20:22.020,0:20:24.880
whatever happened to you would be your fault.

0:20:24.880,0:20:28.580
I would go to the spiritual world to have meetings.

0:20:28.580,0:20:35.700
If somebody opened that door and saw me, they would surely be initiated.

0:20:35.700,0:20:39.820
I was also a pastor then

0:20:39.820,0:20:46.960
Before I met my wife, this spiritual wife gave me two powers:

0:20:46.960,0:21:02.700
whatever I spoke would happen and in my eyes, I had a seduction spirit.

0:21:02.700,0:21:11.600
Whether you are married or not, if I liked you, I would get you,

0:21:11.600,0:21:13.940
no matter where you run to.

0:21:13.940,0:21:18.140
That is, those who are not Christians because we do not have anything to do with Christians.

0:21:18.140,0:21:26.140
When I saw my wife, I thought she was the kind of person I wanted to marry.

0:21:26.140,0:21:32.320
I looked at her and as our eyes met, I seduced her because at that time,

0:21:32.320,0:21:35.520
she was about to marry somebody else.

0:21:35.520,0:21:42.140
Since that person had not officially married her, I claimed her to be my wife.

0:21:42.140,0:21:45.220
Though she hated me at that time, she began to have an interest in me

0:21:45.220,0:21:47.860
and whatever I asked her to do, she did.

0:21:47.860,0:21:55.460
There was a day I went to my elder brother who had money.

0:21:55.460,0:21:59.540
I asked him to give me sixty naira to get a passport

0:21:59.540,0:22:02.020
because there was a job I wanted to secure.

0:22:02.020,0:22:05.940
He brought out a bunch of money and showed it to me and said,

0:22:05.940,0:22:08.920
"You are my brother, go and look for your own money".

0:22:08.920,0:22:13.420
I said, "No problem" and left him.

0:22:13.420,0:22:25.480
Since that time till now, my elder brother is now doing a petty business in a local market.

0:22:25.480,0:22:27.300
He is nothing to write home about.

0:22:27.300,0:22:29.380
Last week, I was delivered.

0:22:29.380,0:22:34.180
So, since the beginning of your life, that evil spirit has been tormenting you?

0:22:34.180,0:22:37.460
It tormented me but I clothed myself with 'Christianity'

0:22:37.460,0:22:40.500
and with the name 'pastor' but nobody knew.

0:22:40.500,0:22:45.040
If I came to your church or if I was preaching,

0:22:45.040,0:22:50.080
you must surely come out when I call an altar call because they saw me as a pastor.

0:22:50.080,0:22:51.880
So you preach very well?

0:22:51.880,0:22:54.360
I preach very well, sir.

0:22:54.360,0:22:57.220
My wife is a prophetess.

0:22:57.220,0:23:03.760
She is a prophetess indeed but the other way round.

0:23:03.760,0:23:09.220
We started having disagreements and quarrels.

0:23:09.220,0:23:13.920
My spiritual wife did not allow her to have peace of mind.

0:23:13.920,0:23:14.620
Okay.

0:23:14.620,0:23:16.620
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:23:16.620,0:23:19.840
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:23:19.840,0:23:24.140
Speak out! Who are you?

0:23:24.140,0:23:25.340
We are three.

0:23:25.340,0:23:27.120
Mention yourselves.

0:23:27.120,0:23:36.400
Idol from the mother's house, spiritual husband, and she is a queen.

0:23:36.400,0:23:38.580
How do you operate in this body?

0:23:38.580,0:23:44.400
We gave her anger and barrenness.

0:23:44.400,0:23:47.800
Any time she was pregnant, we would come as a nurse.

0:23:47.800,0:23:52.060
She would deliver into our hands and we would leave with the child.

0:23:52.060,0:24:02.760
She used to go to spiritual doctors and thought she was going for protection.

0:24:02.760,0:24:04.100
Look at it here.

0:24:04.100,0:24:05.780
What is that?

0:24:05.780,0:24:07.680
We entered through this place.

0:24:07.680,0:24:09.140
Touch the place.

0:24:09.140,0:24:11.540
Look at it.

0:24:11.540,0:24:20.400
Look at the flowers here; we entered through there.

0:24:20.400,0:24:25.640
I wanted to kill her in the late 80's.

0:24:25.640,0:24:32.380
The first man who wanted to marry her - we gave her a drug addict and seller.

0:24:32.380,0:24:34.560
She refused.

0:24:34.560,0:24:39.720
They took her to a place where they told her that if she married a pastor,

0:24:39.720,0:24:44.000
she would suffer and not give birth to a child.

0:24:44.000,0:24:51.780
She became pregnant and we took another one, that was in 2001, when she had a son.

0:24:51.800,0:24:55.660
The other three boys, four in all, we took them all.

0:24:55.660,0:24:59.400
She is crying every minute of the day.

0:24:59.400,0:25:01.600
What have you done to her career?

0:25:01.600,0:25:06.340
She is a prophetess. I have finished everything about her career.

0:25:06.340,0:25:08.080
I closed the church down.

0:25:08.080,0:25:10.800
What have you done to her husband?

0:25:10.800,0:25:12.560
Does she have a husband?

0:25:12.560,0:25:16.640
OK, let's find out because we are seeing a man standing next to her.

0:25:16.640,0:25:18.720
You are welcome, sir.

0:25:18.720,0:25:20.600
Who is this woman to you?

0:25:20.600,0:25:24.500
She is my married wife; I married her as tradition demands.

0:25:24.500,0:25:26.940
OK, let's find out. Who is this man to you?

0:25:26.940,0:25:31.620
This man here is a snatcher. He snatched my wife from me.

0:25:31.620,0:25:32.740
Are you a snatcher, sir?

0:25:32.740,0:25:33.980
I am not a snatcher.

0:25:33.980,0:25:36.100
What have you done to this man?

0:25:36.100,0:25:38.460
I pushed him to women.

0:25:38.460,0:25:41.300
He would be going from one woman to another.

0:25:41.300,0:25:47.160
This idiot would cry.

0:25:47.160,0:25:51.620
She would call him on the phone but he would not answer her.

0:25:51.620,0:26:01.700
When she cries, we are happy. We would be teasing her.

0:26:01.700,0:26:04.140
Sir, did you listen to what she said?

0:26:04.140,0:26:05.560
I heard her.

0:26:05.560,0:26:07.860
What can you say about what she said?

0:26:07.860,0:26:18.700
The life she lives as a pastor, I am always ashamed to walk with her on the road.

0:26:18.700,0:26:20.840
She smokes.

0:26:20.840,0:26:24.740
In fact, I am enduring because I love her.

0:26:24.740,0:26:28.620
She said she is a pastoress, a prophetess. Are you confirming this to be true?

0:26:28.620,0:26:30.240
Yes.

0:26:30.240,0:26:32.760
What about you? Who are you, sir?

0:26:32.760,0:26:34.840
I am also a pastor, a minister.

0:26:34.840,0:26:38.760
I gave her cigarettes in the dream and she smoked when she was young -

0:26:38.760,0:26:41.620
about 13 years old.

0:26:41.620,0:26:45.260
The day I found out that she liked cigarettes, I was shocked.

0:26:45.260,0:26:47.600
She said she could not do without cigarettes.

0:26:47.600,0:26:53.000
She started smoking when she was in Primary Six.

0:26:53.000,0:26:55.980
What else have you done to this woman?

0:26:55.980,0:27:06.240
Sickness - I gave her hypertension, diabetes and waist pain.

0:27:06.240,0:27:11.460
I gave her serious headaches and general body pain - from head to toe.

0:27:11.460,0:27:12.620
What can you say about it?

0:27:12.620,0:27:18.240
It is true. She can never sleep without drugs.

0:27:18.240,0:27:23.580
Right now, you contrary spirit, this body belongs to Jesus. Get out!

0:27:23.580,0:27:25.640
Come out of this body!

0:27:25.640,0:27:27.660
Out!

0:27:27.660,0:27:33.400
All over your body, Holy Ghost fire!

0:27:33.400,0:27:38.220
Come out of her!

0:27:38.220,0:27:44.620
Every part of your body!

0:27:44.620,0:27:46.600
Thank You, Lord, for her deliverance.

0:27:46.600,0:27:49.660
In Jesus' name!

0:27:49.660,0:27:50.880
Amen.

0:27:50.880,0:27:58.060
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:27:58.060,0:27:59.700
Hallelujah.

0:27:59.700,0:28:02.200
Rise up. You are delivered.

0:28:02.200,0:28:11.860
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:28:11.860,0:28:13.600
How are you, Madam?

0:28:13.600,0:28:15.560
I am fine.

0:28:15.560,0:28:21.880
You said that you possessed a contrary spirit that destroyed your marriage life,

0:28:21.880,0:28:27.740
gave you the spirit of smoking and also destroyed your career.

0:28:27.740,0:28:30.040
I have been crying.

0:28:30.040,0:28:32.360
People said that I was a good woman.

0:28:32.360,0:28:35.560
But I didn't see anything good in me because I used to smoke.

0:28:35.560,0:28:36.820
Thank You, Jesus!

0:28:36.820,0:28:41.300
Right now, how do you feel within you after the deliverance?

0:28:41.300,0:28:43.180
I am okay.

0:28:43.180,0:28:44.800
Who is this man to you?

0:28:44.800,0:28:45.960
He is my best.

0:28:45.960,0:28:47.440
Is he not a snatcher?

0:28:47.440,0:28:48.660
He is my best.

0:28:48.660,0:28:50.380
Thank You, Jesus!

0:28:50.380,0:28:52.340
Her past is over. She is delivered.

0:28:52.340,0:28:57.200
Don't use it against her. Otherwise you too will be tempted.

0:28:57.200,0:28:58.940
Thank You, Jesus!

0:28:58.940,0:29:01.920
My name is Prophetess Mrs Omoze Uche.

0:29:01.920,0:29:03.360
Ah, Prophetess?

0:29:03.360,0:29:04.660
Yes, sir.

0:29:04.660,0:29:06.460
We come from Aba (Nigeria).

0:29:06.460,0:29:10.820
It all started when I was living with my grandmother

0:29:10.820,0:29:17.540
and she told me anything I ate in the dream, I should try and eat it physically.

0:29:17.540,0:29:21.080
When I was younger, I smoked in my dreams.

0:29:21.080,0:29:28.280
When I woke up, I went to a store where they sold cigarettes.

0:29:28.280,0:29:32.820
The people in the shop asked me who had sent me to buy the cigarettes.

0:29:32.820,0:29:34.780
I told them that it was my elder brother.

0:29:34.780,0:29:36.840
They asked me the name of the cigarettes.

0:29:36.840,0:29:39.400
I told them that I didn't know but pointed at them

0:29:39.400,0:29:43.180
because they were the ones I smoked in my dreams.

0:29:43.180,0:29:47.780
You have been smoking for how many years now?

0:29:47.780,0:29:53.320
It has been about 25 years. I smoked a packet of cigarettes every day.

0:29:53.320,0:29:55.460
After your deliverance?

0:29:55.460,0:29:58.440
Since Sunday, I have no urge to smoke.

0:29:58.440,0:30:00.200
I don't even remember smoking.

0:30:00.200,0:30:05.840
Rise up! She said she doesn't even remember, talkless of smoking.

0:30:05.840,0:30:09.920
Do you know that this is the problem of the whole world?

0:30:09.920,0:30:12.380
If I am talking, let me see your hand.

0:30:12.380,0:30:15.000
Do you know that this is the problem of the whole world?

0:30:15.000,0:30:19.780
50% of people in the world are addicted to smoking.

0:30:19.780,0:30:24.740
And after smoking, they can do anything, they can commit suicide.

0:30:24.740,0:30:32.680
She said that after the deliverance, she does not even remember, talkless thinking of the urge.

0:30:32.680,0:30:36.260
She does not even remember that she was smoking before.

0:30:36.260,0:30:41.940
Just like that.

0:30:41.940,0:30:45.940
Viewers all over the world, did you listen to that?

0:30:45.940,0:30:49.900
If you are a smoker, just come for deliverance.

0:30:49.900,0:31:00.260
Jesus will deliver you.

0:31:00.260,0:31:03.800
Thank you. You may be seated.

0:31:03.800,0:31:10.340
So enough is enough. Satan has no room again in your life.

0:31:10.340,0:31:15.320
I did a lot of things in this life, in the name of Christianity.

0:31:15.320,0:31:22.140
My advice to people, particularly pastors and parents:

0:31:22.140,0:31:26.720
Look and know who is who in your church

0:31:26.720,0:31:31.160
because there are pastors who claim to be pastors but they are not.

0:31:31.160,0:31:34.840
Please, whatever you are doing in this life,

0:31:34.840,0:31:39.020
make sure you are not a goat in sheep's clothing.

0:31:39.020,0:31:41.360
Thank you. Let's hear from the woman.

0:31:41.360,0:31:47.440
I thank God today for the man of God and the wise men

0:31:47.440,0:31:51.960
who He used to deliver me and my husband.

0:31:51.960,0:31:55.300
There is an instruction now from God.

0:31:55.300,0:32:00.760
My brother there, I want you, with respect, remove your collar.

0:32:00.760,0:32:06.720
Let's later ask God whether you are called to the work of God.

0:32:06.720,0:32:17.440
You remove your collar.

0:32:17.440,0:32:28.280
I would like you to personally address yourselves as Mr and your wife as Mrs now to the whole world.

0:32:28.280,0:32:34.480
Later, after the service, we will come together and ask God what His direction is.

0:32:34.480,0:32:39.540
You have given pain to your own kingdom, not the Kingdom of God.

0:32:39.540,0:32:43.580
We are free moral agents. You can choose not to submit to satan.

0:32:43.580,0:32:46.060
And you can choose not to submit today.

0:32:46.060,0:32:50.500
You submitted to satan, and satan used you mightly

0:32:50.500,0:32:54.540
because we remember when you said a woman entered the vehicle

0:32:54.540,0:32:59.240
and you people entered and she carried you to a hotel; it was somebody you didn't know.

0:32:59.240,0:33:04.120
If she had used you for a ritual at the hotel, definitely, nobody would have known.

0:33:04.120,0:33:08.960
I will not leave you unless God gives us the direction you should follow,

0:33:08.960,0:33:13.300
to really show that you regret the way satan used you.

0:33:13.300,0:33:24.660
Now, I am telling the whole world that our names are Mr and Mrs Ekeoma Uche,

0:33:24.660,0:33:33.160
not Pastor and Prophetess Uche Ekeoma.

0:33:33.160,0:33:37.880
I will pray with you to ask God the direction for your life -

0:33:37.880,0:33:42.220
whether God wants you to be an engineer or go back to do the work of teaching

0:33:42.220,0:33:46.320
or lawyer or whatever. We can now ask God.

0:33:46.320,0:33:53.540
Or if it is the work of God, God wants you to do, you will now begin to...

0:33:53.540,0:33:59.740
Not that name you bore before now. Okay?

0:33:59.740,0:34:08.160
I apologise to the world for the name I was moving with as a pastor.

0:34:08.160,0:34:17.080
Now I believe that God will grant me the grace, in Jesus' name.

0:34:17.080,0:34:19.240
Can we hear from your wife?

0:34:19.240,0:34:28.320
My name now is Mrs Omoze Uche Ekeoma, not Prophetess Okeoma Uche.

0:34:28.320,0:34:31.240
I apologise to the world.

0:34:31.240,0:34:39.700
Let the will of God, through the man of God, be done in our lives.

0:34:39.700,0:34:43.840
Thank you. Rise up and give thanks to God.

0:34:43.840,0:34:46.360
Just bow down your head

0:34:46.360,0:34:55.720
and let's come together and pray to God to show His mercy upon humankind.

0:34:55.720,0:34:58.800
Bow down your head and ask God for His mercy and favour

0:34:58.800,0:35:01.020
and that He should continue to show His mercy.

0:35:01.020,0:35:06.980
His mercy and favour will never end.

0:35:06.980,0:35:10.540
Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name.

0:35:10.540,0:35:12.020
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:35:12.020,0:35:17.920
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
