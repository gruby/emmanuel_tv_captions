Emmanuel (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:05.840,0:00:07.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:07.800,0:00:09.720
Thank you

0:00:09.720,0:00:16.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:16.040,0:00:21.800
We were shocked this morning when we saw many people around the church -

0:00:21.800,0:00:28.240
they came to me and said that there are people around the church with sickness and disease.

0:00:28.240,0:00:33.620
I said, "Wow, this is not a healing service".

0:00:33.620,0:00:35.640
It is a normal service.

0:00:35.640,0:00:38.120
But what we are seeing today -

0:00:38.120,0:00:41.700
I think we will not allow these people to go.

0:00:41.700,0:00:43.400
But next time...

0:00:43.400,0:00:48.880
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:48.880,0:00:57.260
Next time I think God would permit us to allow them to go.

0:00:57.260,0:00:59.980
Yes, that is the way God does.

0:00:59.980,0:01:03.500
He said before one is before all.

0:01:03.500,0:01:06.160
Don't do that again.

0:01:06.160,0:01:10.860
Yes, if you now do them...

0:01:10.860,0:01:12.680
Okay.

0:01:12.680,0:01:19.680
While praying for them, the grace is enough for you to receive: Put your demand on the anointing

0:01:19.680,0:01:23.380
While praying for them you do what? Put your demand on the anointing.

0:01:23.380,0:01:27.700
When I say, "In the name of Jesus", you say, "Oh, Lord Jesus, oh Lord".

0:01:27.700,0:01:31.760
While I pray for them, begin to pray for yourself

0:01:31.760,0:01:35.280
and when the person gets healed, you are healed.

0:01:35.280,0:01:38.840
When the person gets delivered, you are delivered.

0:01:38.840,0:01:40.580
Hallelujah.

0:01:40.580,0:01:44.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:44.980,0:01:51.100
Let me usher you to that because we are about to enter another section.

0:01:51.100,0:01:58.300
It will be be difficult for me to begin to heal, pray for people and carry you along without ushering you there.

0:01:58.300,0:02:04.820
Ushering means teaching you, preparing you.

0:02:04.820,0:02:10.840
You need a proper connection to understand what we are about to do.

0:02:10.840,0:02:18.360
You just finished dancing. That realm of dancing - it takes anointing to dance.

0:02:18.360,0:02:24.260
I need to take you out of that, and take you to another realm.

0:02:24.260,0:02:27.420
So, I need to get you prepared.

0:02:27.420,0:02:29.900
Hallelujah.

0:02:29.900,0:02:31.520
Are you there?

0:02:31.520,0:02:34.620
We are going to another realm -

0:02:34.620,0:02:41.920
another realm where you will see things happen, but you won't know how they happened.

0:02:41.920,0:02:51.260
Another realm where physical hands will not be needed to do things.

0:02:51.260,0:03:03.180
You will see this happen - our strength, our tension are not necessary, are not needed -

0:03:03.180,0:03:13.360
another realm where our voice and our tongue are not needed.

0:03:13.360,0:03:18.920
When you want to move this, you need to use your hand.

0:03:18.920,0:03:25.660
But in this case, you don't need the hand to take it, and it will move.

0:03:25.660,0:03:32.180
That is why it is difficult for us to understand why something happens.

0:03:32.180,0:03:37.900
God does not give us what we know how to do.

0:03:37.900,0:03:48.040
He always gives us what we don't know how to do, so that he can teach us.

0:03:48.040,0:03:53.140
God does not give us what we know how to do.

0:03:53.140,0:03:55.380
Look at this.

0:03:55.380,0:04:01.500
If God says, "Carry it", you know how to carry it. This is it.

0:04:01.500,0:04:10.700
No, what God normally does is to ask you to carry this pillar. Look at the pillar.

0:04:10.700,0:04:15.620
Can you carry it ? He always gives us what we don't know how to do,

0:04:15.620,0:04:18.580
what we cannot even do by ourselves.

0:04:18.580,0:04:28.220
Because he wants to teach us - in the process of teaching us, He gets us trained in His own way.

0:04:28.220,0:04:32.980
He gets us reformed in His own way.

0:04:32.980,0:04:34.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:34.980,0:04:37.220
Are you with me?

0:04:37.220,0:04:45.660
He does not just heal what a medical doctor can just treat you for.

0:04:45.660,0:04:50.600
If you are sick, you meet a doctor and he would treat you.

0:04:50.600,0:04:52.900
This is why I was saying:

0:04:52.900,0:04:57.060
If you cannot believe God with your tablets and your drugs,

0:04:57.060,0:05:02.160
you cannot believe Him without your tablets.

0:05:02.160,0:05:09.540
You carry a drug for hypertension, a drug for heart attack, a drug for diabetics.

0:05:09.540,0:05:12.960
You have it in your pocket because you must take it every two hours.

0:05:12.960,0:05:22.820
You are sitting down and begin to pray, "Lord, I don't want to use these drugs anymore. Heal me, heal me".

0:05:22.820,0:05:25.180
At the end of the day, you are prayed for.

0:05:25.180,0:05:29.720
After praying for you, you now begin to look for an evangelist,

0:05:29.720,0:05:34.860
"Please, I want to know whether I should still use my drugs.

0:05:34.860,0:05:39.160
I want to know whether I can still use my tablets.

0:05:39.160,0:05:43.660
I would need to see the man of God".

0:05:43.660,0:05:49.120
"Prophet, these are my tablets. I don't know what to do with it."

0:05:49.120,0:05:54.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:54.040,0:05:58.060
If you cannot believe God with your tablets and your drugs,

0:05:58.060,0:06:04.560
you cannot believe Him without your tablets and your drugs.

0:06:04.560,0:06:11.100
God has nothing against your tablets.

0:06:11.100,0:06:16.780
He has nothing against it - it is made from a natural plant.

0:06:16.780,0:06:26.020
The soap you are using, either a medicated or a different kind of soap -

0:06:26.020,0:06:36.040
those things are just like tablets. If using tablets is wrong, the soap you are using is also wrong.

0:06:36.040,0:06:40.480
The cream you are using to rub your body is wrong.

0:06:40.480,0:06:46.680
These are from plants, medicated things from the doctors and pharmacies.

0:06:46.680,0:06:54.960
If that drug is bad, your cream, your soap you are using every day are then also bad.

0:06:54.960,0:07:01.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:01.720,0:07:08.240
I was giving you some clues on how you would know that you are free

0:07:08.240,0:07:12.420
or that God does not want you to use your tablets again.

0:07:12.420,0:07:19.240
If you have been prayed for, there are some signs that actually remind you of your tablets:

0:07:19.240,0:07:28.800
either you would have a serious headache, feel dizzy or discomfort.

0:07:28.800,0:07:31.060
Your body would be trembling.

0:07:31.060,0:07:37.140
These are some of the signs that would normally remind you of your tablets.

0:07:37.140,0:07:44.000
But when you have been prayed for and suddenly, you don't have those signs again,

0:07:44.000,0:07:46.760
automatically, you will forget your drugs.

0:07:46.760,0:07:50.080
You just find that you live, sleep and eat.

0:07:50.080,0:07:55.800
On the second or third day, you ask yourself, "I have not been taking that drug, I've forgotten".

0:07:55.800,0:08:02.360
You have forgotten because those signs are gone. That is God.

0:08:02.360,0:08:07.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:07.520,0:08:10.100
That is God.

0:08:10.100,0:08:15.740
You have to forget because those signs are gone.

0:08:15.740,0:08:27.360
When those signs are gone - the signs of headache, unability to sleep, unability to eat, all kinds of signs -

0:08:27.360,0:08:34.300
you cannot sense them again, and those are the signs that remind you of your drug and tablets.

0:08:34.300,0:08:44.080
First, second day, you will just realise, "My dear, for the past two days, I have not been taking my drugs.

0:08:44.080,0:08:45.700
because those signs are gone".

0:08:45.700,0:08:47.700
That is God.

0:08:47.700,0:08:49.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:49.120,0:08:56.320
But when you keep on remembering your drugs after you have been prayed for,

0:08:56.320,0:08:58.760
something is wrong.

0:08:58.760,0:09:05.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:05.480,0:09:06.680
That is it.

0:09:06.680,0:09:11.440
Many of you have been sitting here since this morning.

0:09:11.440,0:09:18.200
At home, they can't try to sit for five hours without taking a tablet.

0:09:18.200,0:09:23.680
But right now, they have forgotten about their tablet because they can't feel any sign.

0:09:23.680,0:09:25.200
That is God.

0:09:25.200,0:09:31.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:31.700,0:09:33.700
That is God.

0:09:33.700,0:09:35.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:35.300,0:09:41.780
Let us quickly move ahead to our healing and deliverance section today.

0:09:41.780,0:09:45.360
Let's take a very short text in the Bible.

0:09:45.360,0:09:48.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:48.140,0:09:55.020
The book of John 1, verse 33:

0:09:55.020,0:10:07.200
"And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptise with water told me."

0:10:07.200,0:10:10.920
If you take it from verse 1, you would understand it better.

0:10:10.920,0:10:13.300
But I am taking it from verse 33.

0:10:13.300,0:10:14.680
I take it again:

0:10:14.680,0:10:23.200
"And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptise with water told me,

0:10:23.200,0:10:35.020
the man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain..."

0:10:35.020,0:10:45.360
But today, it is like the Spirit comes down on us but does not remain.

0:10:45.360,0:10:51.800
The miracle happens to us but seems not to be permanent.

0:10:51.800,0:10:58.900
We keep receiving blessing but we cannot keep the blessing.

0:10:58.900,0:11:05.600
We keep receiving deliverance but after a while, you are possessed again.

0:11:05.600,0:11:10.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:10.200,0:11:21.520
Jesus wants to be Himself in us.

0:11:21.520,0:11:22.620
Are you with me?

0:11:22.620,0:11:25.940
He wants to be Himself in us.

0:11:25.940,0:11:27.720
MESSAGE TITLE: LET THE HOLY SPIRIT REMAIN

0:11:27.720,0:11:33.980
But because we keep on grieving Him, we are not allowing Him.

0:11:33.980,0:11:43.920
He does not remain permanent when we grieve Him.

0:11:43.920,0:11:50.120
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:11:50.120,0:11:51.780
He does not remain.

0:11:51.780,0:11:54.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:54.720,0:12:05.680
We grieve Him by our pride and we express our pride in various ways.

0:12:05.680,0:12:11.920
Like this: "OK, those of you that received healing, come out".

0:12:11.920,0:12:16.580
When you are waiting for healing, you are crying, shouting, this and that.

0:12:16.580,0:12:21.060
Immediately you are healed, you don't want to come out.

0:12:21.060,0:12:23.160
You don't want to face the camera.

0:12:23.160,0:12:28.020
But when you were sick, you wanted to face the camera.

0:12:28.020,0:12:33.320
We express our pride in various ways.

0:12:33.320,0:12:37.200
Can you see some of the reasons why we cannot maintain...

0:12:37.200,0:12:40.700
It says that the Holy Spirit came down on Him and remained.

0:12:40.700,0:12:44.920
We receive but not remain.

0:12:44.920,0:12:48.320
After a while when we get out there...

0:12:48.320,0:12:50.980
There are many things we do.

0:12:50.980,0:12:58.880
You hold a grudge against your brother - you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:12:58.880,0:13:07.180
After the healing, you still hold a grudge against your brother

0:13:07.180,0:13:13.640
and the Bible says,"'Forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us".

0:13:13.640,0:13:17.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:17.820,0:13:28.000
You should not be surprised if the Bible is not real while reading, if you hold a grudge.

0:13:28.000,0:13:31.000
You will be reading the Bible, but it is not alive

0:13:31.000,0:13:36.480
because you are holding a grudge, offence against your brother.

0:13:36.480,0:13:45.400
That is one of the reasons why when you read the Bible, you are just wasting your time.

0:13:45.400,0:13:49.180
There is no life in what you are reading about.

0:13:49.180,0:13:55.020
There is book, there is life, coming together.

0:13:55.020,0:14:04.420
Scripture is literature but when it is inspired by the Holy Spirit, it becomes the Bible.

0:14:04.420,0:14:10.360
It is when it is inspired by the Holy Spirit, it has authority.

0:14:10.360,0:14:13.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:13.680,0:14:25.300
When you hold grudges against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:14:25.300,0:14:33.720
You should not be surprised if the Bible is not real when reading.

0:14:33.720,0:14:38.500
This is why we men of God - sometimes, I just laugh.

0:14:38.500,0:14:44.180
Holding offence against ourselves and we stand on the pulpit and begin to preach.

0:14:44.180,0:14:52.160
The Bible cannot be real when holding an offence or you just finished accusing your fellow ministers of God,

0:14:52.160,0:14:58.400
"That place is not good" and on next Sunday, you hold the Bible and begin to preach.

0:14:58.400,0:15:09.300
What do you need to do now before we go into the realm of healing, deliverance and salvation?

0:15:09.300,0:15:15.980
You need to let go of your past.

0:15:15.980,0:15:22.900
Whether you are right or wrong, if you let go in your heart, it is OK.

0:15:22.900,0:15:28.520
Even without giving a phone call to whoever you are holding an offence against,

0:15:28.520,0:15:32.440
once you let go in your heart, it is finished.

0:15:32.440,0:15:36.060
You have settled with God.

0:15:36.060,0:15:40.160
Even if you don't give a phone call to the person you are holding an offence against,

0:15:40.160,0:15:46.820
but you decide in your heart to let go, you have settled with God.

0:15:46.820,0:15:56.560
When you sometimes say, "This woman - they should kill her", you don't know that maybe this woman has settled with God.

0:15:56.560,0:16:01.780
If you have killed the woman, and this woman had settled with God, you are committing an offence.

0:16:01.780,0:16:06.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:06.460,0:16:08.940
Let go of offence

0:16:08.940,0:16:14.280
because Jesus wants to be Himself in us.

0:16:14.280,0:16:15.360
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:15.360,0:16:18.320
Jesus wants to be Himself in us.

0:16:18.320,0:16:24.880
The Holy Spirit wants to be Himself in us.

0:16:24.880,0:16:35.280
If He wants to be Himself in us, we need to allow Him to be Himself in us.

0:16:35.280,0:16:38.380
We need to do what?

0:16:38.380,0:16:39.640
Tell your neighbour:

0:16:39.640,0:16:48.000
You need to allow Him to be Himself in you.

0:16:48.000,0:16:57.460
By holding offence against your neighbour, the Holy Spirit cannot remain.

0:16:57.460,0:17:02.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:02.280,0:17:09.720
All you need to know now is: How can the blessing remain?

0:17:09.720,0:17:13.400
That is what we call maintenance.

0:17:13.400,0:17:18.200
If you are healed, will you be able to maintain the healing?

0:17:18.200,0:17:23.200
If you are delivered, how will you maintain the deliverance?

0:17:23.200,0:17:28.740
If you are blessed, how will you maintain the blessing?

0:17:28.740,0:17:34.640
Your life is like this because you have not maintained them.

0:17:34.640,0:17:39.920
If you had been maintaining God's blessings in your life, your life would not look like this.

0:17:39.920,0:17:43.500
Many things God had given you, you failed to maintain them.

MESSAGE TITLE: LET THE HOLY SPIRIT REMAIN

0:17:47.860,0:17:59.160
Holding grudges against your brother - you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:17:59.160,0:18:07.800
When you grieve the Holy Spirit, you will read the Bible but will not understand it.

0:18:07.800,0:18:14.800
It will not be alive - as if you are reading literature, as if you are reading a novel.

0:18:14.800,0:18:17.800
This is why you don't understand the Bible.

0:18:17.800,0:18:23.040
You take some psalms to read, you rehearse the psalms.

0:18:23.040,0:18:24.340
And you realise that... no!

0:18:24.340,0:18:28.640
Even the name Jesus you call, you are supposed to call it by authority -

0:18:28.640,0:18:33.640
but each time you call the name Jesus, you are calling yourself.

0:18:33.640,0:18:39.760
You say, "In Jesus' name" and you realise you are calling yourself because nobody answers you.

0:18:39.760,0:18:44.620
Only the people that are around you hear you, and you yourself hear yourself.

0:18:44.620,0:18:58.780
That is just it because you have grieved the Holy Spirit by holding offence, holding grudges.

0:18:58.780,0:19:02.200
Begin to release yourself right now.

0:19:02.200,0:19:07.620
You can make a decision now that enough is enough.

0:19:07.620,0:19:13.560
I have said it all. Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right...

0:19:13.560,0:19:15.300
Leave it for God.

0:19:15.300,0:19:18.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:18.120,0:19:24.780
Begin right now; let me see your heart, your spirit in communion with God.

0:19:24.780,0:19:28.420
Begin to communicate; begin to pray right now.

0:19:28.420,0:19:36.460
Begin to pray and say, "Lord I surrender".

0:19:36.460,0:19:42.920
That is the first step in surrendering to God; say "I surrender".

0:19:42.920,0:19:53.300
If you have surrendered, have you let go of offence, pain of the past, bitterness?

0:19:53.300,0:19:56.340
At least something happened before you can have bitterness in your heart.

0:19:56.340,0:19:58.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:58.760,0:20:00.000
Resentment.

0:20:00.000,0:20:02.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:02.820,0:20:04.000
Hatred.

0:20:04.000,0:20:06.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:06.600,0:20:13.120
Right now, I want to see your spirit begin to commune with God, pray in your spirit.

0:20:13.120,0:20:16.220
Pray in your spirit.

0:20:16.220,0:20:23.680
Begin to settle your account right now, viewers at home, begin to settle your account.

0:20:23.680,0:20:32.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:32.720,0:20:35.240
Thank You, Lord. In Jesus' name.

0:20:35.240,0:20:38.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:38.080,0:20:39.840
Rise up. I surrender.

0:20:39.840,0:20:41.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:41.340,0:20:59.380
All to Jesus I surrender, all to Him I freely give

0:20:59.380,0:21:17.980
I will ever love and trust Him in His presence daily

0:21:17.980,0:21:36.120
I surrender all

0:21:36.120,0:21:54.180
All to Thee my blessed Saviour I surrender all

0:21:54.180,0:22:12.000
I surrender all

0:22:12.000,0:22:27.900
All to Thee my blessed Saviour I surrender all

0:22:27.900,0:22:38.200
That is the first step in relationship with God.

0:22:38.200,0:22:45.520
It has been very difficult for many of us; you keep claiming your rights.

0:22:45.520,0:22:47.840
I have been cheated.

0:22:47.840,0:22:50.540
This is an embarrassment.

0:22:50.540,0:22:53.480
He is the one to be saying sorry.

0:22:53.480,0:22:55.200
He cheated me.

0:22:55.200,0:23:04.400
No. Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence

0:23:04.400,0:23:08.200
or grudge against your brother.

0:23:08.200,0:23:13.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:13.660,0:23:17.980
Because it affects every area of your life.

0:23:17.980,0:23:22.300
You read the Bible, it will not come alive.

0:23:22.300,0:23:26.760
It is this heart that converts what you are reading.

0:23:26.760,0:23:30.460
You read and take it to the conversion room;

0:23:30.460,0:23:35.780
the conversion room will convert it and send it to the Holy Spirit.

0:23:35.780,0:23:40.780
Oh my God, I hope you quite understand what I am talking about.

0:23:40.780,0:23:44.440
Let me use the Bible as a good example of what I am talking about.

0:23:44.440,0:23:47.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:47.960,0:23:51.960
This is my Bible.

0:23:51.960,0:23:59.720
I open my Bible, I would read: "The Lord would have compassion on Jacob".

0:23:59.720,0:24:04.700
What I have just read now, would be taken to the heart.

0:24:04.700,0:24:10.900
If it does not go to the heart, it is just mere literature, words.

0:24:10.900,0:24:19.840
I have read it now. For that Word to be real and to be alive, it needs to be taken to the heart.

0:24:19.840,0:24:27.340
The heart would now convert the Word. After converting the Word, it would send it the Holy Ghost.

0:24:27.340,0:24:30.260
The Holy Spirit would now be affecting it.

0:24:30.260,0:24:37.720
It would now become an instrument of healing, blessing, salvation and deliverance.

0:24:37.720,0:24:42.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:42.920,0:24:47.920
I hope you understand the word conversion.

0:24:47.920,0:24:51.180
It means to refine.

0:24:51.180,0:25:01.420
When you take gold, it needs to pass through the furnace for refining.

0:25:01.420,0:25:08.660
So also, the Word you are reading now, "The Lord would have compassion for Jacob".

0:25:08.660,0:25:13.400
This is the Word but it would go straight to the heart

0:25:13.400,0:25:16.560
and the heart would now refine it.

0:25:16.560,0:25:23.920
When the heart refines it, it would now join the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God

0:25:23.920,0:25:27.740
and then, it becomes an instrument.

0:25:27.740,0:25:31.960
Heart means man's spirit.

0:25:31.960,0:25:37.000
But if your heart is holding grudges,

0:25:37.000,0:25:40.780
if your heart is holding pain,

0:25:40.780,0:25:45.660
if your heart is holding hatred, it would not go there.

0:25:45.660,0:25:48.880
Only one thing occupies the heart.

0:25:48.880,0:25:53.260
Once hatred is there, nothing can go there.

0:25:53.260,0:25:57.740
Unless your heart is clear, you have a free heart.

0:25:57.740,0:26:02.240
When you have that free spirit, there is no hatred in your heart,

0:26:02.240,0:26:05.940
you don't hold grudges, you don't have anything against anyone,

0:26:05.940,0:26:08.920
your heart is free, that means a free spirit.

0:26:08.920,0:26:15.120
Then, the Word can go there, be converted, join to the Spirit of the Father

0:26:15.120,0:26:17.920
and become an instrument to use.

0:26:17.920,0:26:24.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:24.240,0:26:30.040
What is in your heart? A lot.

0:26:30.040,0:26:35.700
Heart means man's spirit. What is in your spirit? A lot.

0:26:35.700,0:26:42.120
That is why this Word you are reading will continue to be literature - history about Jacob.

0:26:42.120,0:26:48.520
If my heart is not free, I am just reading about Jacob.

0:26:48.520,0:26:56.420
It is history about Jacob unless it is taken to the heart, the heart converts it, refines it

0:26:56.420,0:26:59.240
and joins it to the Spirit of the Father.

0:26:59.240,0:27:00.620
When He joins it to the Spirit of the Father,

0:27:00.620,0:27:07.420
it becomes an instrument of healing, deliverance and salvation.

0:27:07.420,0:27:15.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:15.100,0:27:20.820
Ask yourself, "What is in my heart?" Your heart is full of the past.

0:27:20.820,0:27:26.180
People that have hurt you. People that have hated you. People that have cheated you.

0:27:26.180,0:27:27.880
People that have embarrassed you.

0:27:27.880,0:27:32.600
At a lot of the places you worked in the past, they refused to pay you.

0:27:32.600,0:27:40.040
You spent one year in a company and they refused to pay you this money. You will never forgive them.

0:27:40.040,0:27:46.800
If you want to know a true Christian. Just go near, when he is praying.

0:27:46.800,0:27:50.920
Through his prayer, you would know whether he is a Christian or not.

0:27:50.920,0:27:53.820
"Oh God, I rebuke him, I kill him.

0:27:53.820,0:28:00.960
God, I bulldoze him. I will not forgive him. In the name of Jesus."

0:28:00.960,0:28:03.300
You would know that this one is not a Christian.

0:28:03.300,0:28:07.180
That is when he would be vomiting the pain in his heart.

0:28:07.180,0:28:13.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:13.640,0:28:15.920
Ask your neighbour:

0:28:15.920,0:28:20.760
What is in your heart?

0:28:20.760,0:28:25.140
Now you know the meaning of free heart.

0:28:25.140,0:28:28.640
Heart means man's spirit - a free spirit.

0:28:28.640,0:28:34.720
A free spirit is a heart that lets go of offence.

0:28:34.720,0:28:39.700
Once the heart lets go of offence, when you are reading your Bible,

0:28:39.700,0:28:44.700
it will go straight to your heart and your heart will refine it,

0:28:44.700,0:28:50.880
take it to the Holy Ghost, join them together and it will become an instrument.

0:28:50.880,0:28:57.500
But if your heart is not free from all this pain, people that have embarrassed you,

0:28:57.500,0:29:03.080
you can never see the Bible alive or real.

0:29:03.080,0:29:09.800
You continue to read your Bible as if you are reading James Hadley Chase - history.

0:29:09.800,0:29:11.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:11.700,0:29:14.660
The society has cheated you.

0:29:14.660,0:29:18.960
You are a professor, you have PhD, you are jobless.

0:29:18.960,0:29:22.000
The society has cheated you, that's another offence.

0:29:22.000,0:29:24.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:24.600,0:29:29.500
You are working under someone who has no certificate, and you have PhD.

0:29:29.500,0:29:32.940
And this person that has no certificate is your boss.

0:29:32.940,0:29:37.800
Anytime you see him and he calls you, "Come on. Give me that file",

0:29:37.800,0:29:44.300
you ask yourself, "Ah, I have PhD. This one is an illiterate".

0:29:44.300,0:29:48.980
You would still carry that file, with pain.

0:29:48.980,0:29:51.640
You would now carry the file.

0:29:51.640,0:29:55.100
"I know my name"

0:29:55.100,0:29:56.740
You carry the file.

0:29:56.740,0:29:57.960
"Put it here!"

0:29:57.960,0:29:59.480
"Yes, sir."

0:29:59.480,0:30:02.340
You now look at his neck...

0:30:02.340,0:30:05.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:05.220,0:30:12.200
All the time you look at your boss who always instructs you.

0:30:12.200,0:30:16.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:16.860,0:30:25.460
The race is not always for the swiftest or fastest.

0:30:25.460,0:30:31.560
If you are better than your boss in every area of life -

0:30:31.560,0:30:39.820
stature, wisdom, understanding, education, human natural gifts -

0:30:39.820,0:30:43.040
you realise that you are better than him, and he is your boss -

0:30:43.040,0:30:47.540
don't forget that the race is not always for the swiftest.

0:30:47.540,0:30:50.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:50.940,0:30:55.120
God put you there to learn some lessons.

0:30:55.120,0:30:57.840
Your journey is not going to stop there.

0:30:57.840,0:31:02.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:02.940,0:31:08.040
You always talk as if your journey would end there.

0:31:08.040,0:31:13.640
What you are talking about is just one out of history in your life.

0:31:13.640,0:31:20.040
You would soon leave the place. You are going to encounter a lot and a lot.

0:31:20.040,0:31:24.860
If God is preparing you for greatness,

0:31:24.860,0:31:27.040
He would prepare you for that greatness.

0:31:27.040,0:31:30.340
How does God prepare people for greatness?

0:31:30.340,0:31:43.020
He would take you from stupid, through rustic people, illerate people;

0:31:43.020,0:31:48.220
he wants you to understand everything.

0:31:48.220,0:31:54.980
He will allow you to pass through all those foolish things.

0:31:54.980,0:32:04.140
So that when you get to that position, you would understand what it is to be a rustic boy.

0:32:04.140,0:32:11.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:11.780,0:32:14.980
There are many heroes today that are not from God.

0:32:14.980,0:32:18.680
Not every hero or societal people are from God.

0:32:18.680,0:32:20.900
There are many that are not from God.

0:32:20.900,0:32:27.060
This is why God said, "The peace that I am giving you is not as the world gives".

0:32:27.060,0:32:33.200
It means the success I am giving you, is different from the one the world gives.

0:32:33.200,0:32:37.000
God himself declares that the world can give success,

0:32:37.000,0:32:43.820
but my own success is quite different from the one the world gives to its people.

0:32:43.820,0:32:49.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:49.240,0:32:55.000
If now you see someone in a high position, successful, you need to ask,

0:32:55.000,0:32:59.120
"Is this God's success or the world's success?"

0:32:59.120,0:33:07.340
Sometimes, if God is taking you to a high place, He would even allow you to work under the world's success.

0:33:07.340,0:33:11.040
He would allow you to work under criminals.

0:33:11.040,0:33:16.040
He would allow you to work under stupid people.

0:33:16.040,0:33:18.860
But He would protect you.

0:33:18.860,0:33:23.240
The little time He would allow you to work there, He would protect you.

0:33:23.240,0:33:26.260
Because He is preparing you for....

0:33:26.260,0:33:35.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:35.600,0:33:37.640
That is God.

0:33:37.640,0:33:46.320
You must have a degree in love and also in hatred.

0:33:46.320,0:33:52.820
So that when you occupy that position, you will be able to explain, you will be able to understand what it is,

0:33:52.820,0:33:56.000
what it means to go through hatred.

0:33:56.000,0:34:01.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:01.440,0:34:06.760
God always makes us fit for the position.

0:34:06.760,0:34:11.960
He makes us fit for it. He would train us.

0:34:11.960,0:34:14.700
You should be ready for God's training.

0:34:14.700,0:34:17.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:17.500,0:34:20.620
So, once again.

0:34:20.620,0:34:27.040
Take this word: Our heart refines the Word in the Bible.
