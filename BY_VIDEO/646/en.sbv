0:00:00.000,0:00:01.280
Hallelujah!

0:00:01.280,0:00:07.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:07.180,0:00:10.820
Your time has been blessed!

0:00:10.820,0:00:13.660
That is Jesus for you.

0:00:13.660,0:00:19.060
Jesus desires to heal our wounds.

0:00:19.060,0:00:22.840
He desires to heal our wounds.

0:00:22.840,0:00:29.580
When I say 'wounds', I mean everything about you.

0:00:29.580,0:00:35.320
You need healing, deliverance, ‎blessing - just name it.

0:00:35.320,0:00:44.740
He desires to heal your wounds, that is, to free you.‎

0:00:44.740,0:00:50.660
But often we do not permit Him -

0:00:50.660,0:00:53.840
often we do not allow Him. ‎

0:00:53.840,0:00:58.980
It is not something where He can just come by Himself without your faith,

0:00:58.980,0:01:00.620
"Be healed, be delivered!"

0:01:00.620,0:01:04.980
No, it is not ‎possible.

0:01:04.980,0:01:07.960
He can’t just come and say, "Hey, are you sick? Be healed!"

0:01:07.960,0:01:19.120
No! He needs your attention.

0:01:19.120,0:01:34.680
The road ‎to that is not the easiest road.

0:01:34.680,0:01:40.260
There is anointing just everywhere -

0:01:40.260,0:01:42.240
more than enough.

0:01:42.240,0:01:50.100
Now, it is time for you to use your faith to put a demand on the anointing.

0:01:50.100,0:01:52.100
Your faith now!

0:01:52.100,0:01:56.860
The supply is more than the demand.

0:01:56.860,0:02:02.860
When just one person is demanding for something, "Oh, it is too much for me".

0:02:02.860,0:02:04.860
That is just it.

0:02:04.860,0:02:07.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:07.860,0:02:19.560
Let us quickly take a look at the book of Luke 17.‎

0:02:19.560,0:02:33.200
"Jesus said to His disciples: 'Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come...'"

0:02:33.200,0:02:36.680
It is a text you must read every second.

0:02:36.680,0:02:40.300
When you get home, just read it. When you read it, it will guide you.

0:02:40.300,0:02:46.480
All these little irritations that overwhelm you, what people say about you, what people do to you.

0:02:46.480,0:02:50.280
When you know this verse, it will continue to help you.

0:02:50.280,0:02:52.180
Jesus said to you.

0:02:52.180,0:02:55.020
You put your name where the message is personal.

0:02:55.020,0:02:57.360
Jesus said to me.

0:02:57.360,0:03:00.080
Read along with me. One, two, three.

0:03:00.080,0:03:10.460
Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎

0:03:10.460,0:03:12.460
Can we read it together again.

0:03:12.460,0:03:16.300
Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎

0:03:16.300,0:03:23.920
Anytime you read the Bible, insert your name where the message is personal.

0:03:23.920,0:03:25.780
In this case, it is personal.

0:03:25.780,0:03:30.180
"Jesus said to His disciples" - you remove 'disciples' and insert your own name.

0:03:30.180,0:03:40.440
Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎

0:03:40.440,0:03:45.000
If Jesus said this to you, what else again? What are you talking about?

0:03:45.000,0:03:47.740
What are you talking about?

0:03:47.740,0:03:59.760
This means, it is impossible to live this life without offence.

0:03:59.760,0:04:01.880
I like that.

0:04:01.880,0:04:07.500
Can you write it down! Because I know you’re a professor, you’re very educated.

0:04:07.500,0:04:12.480
This word is not something ‎you can put in your memory: It must go in your heart.‎

0:04:12.480,0:04:13.660
Write it on your paper.

0:04:13.660,0:04:16.380
I know you are a professor, you are very educated,

0:04:16.380,0:04:21.200
and the one who is talking to ‎you was your student ‎‏in the past:

0:04:21.200,0:04:25.480
"Ha! T.B. Joshua was my student. I taught him when he was in primary school."

0:04:25.480,0:04:29.980
Ok, sit down there.‎‏

0:04:29.980,0:04:38.500
Take your paper and write something down as it will help you.

0:04:38.500,0:04:41.240
It will help you.

0:04:41.240,0:04:43.660
We read it again before we proceed.

0:04:43.660,0:04:45.660
Are you there?

0:04:45.660,0:04:49.180
That is Luke 17:1.

0:04:49.180,0:05:02.700
Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎

0:05:02.700,0:05:04.280
What does that mean to you?

0:05:04.280,0:05:22.360
It means that it is impossible for me, T.B. Joshua, to live this life without offence.‎

0:05:22.360,0:05:23.660
Tell your neighbour.

0:05:23.660,0:05:35.860
It is impossible for you to live among people without offence.

0:05:35.860,0:05:45.380
Offence can come in any way, whether you are wrong or right. ‎

0:05:45.380,0:05:49.980
I saw you when you were dancing - you had forgotten about offence.

0:05:49.980,0:05:53.040
That is why you were dancing like this.

0:05:53.040,0:05:56.460
I said, "Ah, see my sister, see my brother!"

0:05:56.460,0:05:59.600
Some people were dancing like this.

0:05:59.600,0:06:06.540
After you finished dancing - "Hm, I will deal with that sister!"

0:06:06.540,0:06:08.260
I know you.

0:06:08.260,0:06:10.040
I was laughing.

0:06:10.040,0:06:15.460
Some people were dancing like this.

0:06:15.460,0:06:16.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:16.980,0:06:20.980
I said, "Hey! Jesus, thank You!"

0:06:20.980,0:06:26.220
But after you finished dancing, you sat down like this.

0:06:26.220,0:06:28.220
"I will deal with him!"

0:06:28.220,0:06:33.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:33.500,0:06:37.740
But now that we are talking, you have forgotten about that.

0:06:37.740,0:06:45.060
I want you to forget all trouble forever.

0:06:45.060,0:06:50.860
This is the wall between you and your ‎salvation,

0:06:50.860,0:06:57.760
the wall between you and God.

0:06:57.780,0:07:15.220
A good Christian, a real Christian, should refuse to be offended in order not to offend ‎God.  ‎

0:07:15.220,0:07:16.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:07:16.220,0:07:26.860
A real Christian, a good Christian, a true Christian, should refuse to be offended

0:07:26.860,0:07:30.820
in order not to offend ‎God.

0:07:30.820,0:07:41.560
MESSAGE TITLE: REFUSE TO BE OFFENDED

0:07:41.560,0:07:44.820
Where will you put offence? Is that not where God lives?

0:07:44.820,0:07:49.080
There is no other place - in the heart.‎

0:07:49.080,0:07:53.940
Where will you put offence? Where the Holy Spirit lives.

0:07:53.940,0:07:58.620
There is no other place where you can ‎put offence.

0:07:58.620,0:08:03.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:03.060,0:08:24.220
When we feel offended, we use our tongues out of bitterness, hatred and anger

0:08:24.220,0:08:35.900
to crush a close friendship,

0:08:35.900,0:08:44.120
to split our churches,

0:08:44.120,0:08:50.020
to shatter our marriages,

0:08:50.020,0:08:56.040
to crumble families and tear them apart.

0:08:56.040,0:09:00.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:00.800,0:09:06.340
The people most offended are the people that were cheated.

0:09:06.340,0:09:12.900
It is when you are cheated, you get ‎offended.

0:09:12.900,0:09:27.300
The right people, good people, Christians are the ones.

0:09:27.300,0:09:36.260
The good people are being cheated and embarassed.

0:09:36.260,0:09:47.180
When we feel offended, we do not know that we are trapped.

0:09:47.180,0:09:54.500
That is when you begin to say, "I will deal with him. Ok, I have already dealt with him".

0:09:54.500,0:10:00.780
You do not know that you are trapped.

0:10:00.780,0:10:13.980
Offence is an instrument used by satan to ‎blind us on the reality.

0:10:13.980,0:10:21.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:21.220,0:10:34.020
When you are offended, you see yourself concentrate and focus on the wrong done to ‎you,

0:10:34.020,0:10:44.220
forgetting the condition you are in.‎

0:10:44.220,0:10:48.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:48.360,0:10:54.900
"Ah, why me? This is an insult! I can't believe it!"

0:10:54.900,0:10:58.860
"Why all this? Why now?"

0:10:58.860,0:11:06.320
Whereas he has cancer - he is no longer talking about the cancer in his body.

0:11:06.320,0:11:10.780
"Oh, why all this? Why? What can I do?"

0:11:10.780,0:11:16.600
"No! I trained him. I was the one who trained him from school and now he is a graduate."

0:11:16.600,0:11:21.520
"Now he has become rich. But when he first ‎came, he was living with me."

0:11:21.520,0:11:29.980
"I hosted him. I trained him. I sent him to London. Look at him, ‎he is a nice man."

0:11:29.980,0:11:38.000
Whereas he has diabetes - he is no longer talking about that.

0:11:38.000,0:11:43.000
He is talking about the wrong done to him. ‎

0:11:43.000,0:11:48.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:48.800,0:11:56.660
Offence is very rampant due to lack of real love.

0:11:56.660,0:11:59.080
Due to what? [Real love!]

0:11:59.080,0:12:03.540
There is love and there is real love.

0:12:03.540,0:12:05.080
I mean, genuine love.

0:12:05.080,0:12:16.780
Real love forgets wrong so that there is hope for the future.‎

0:12:16.780,0:12:18.740
What is real love?

0:12:18.740,0:12:21.140
Real love forgets wrong.

0:12:21.140,0:12:22.360
Say to your neighbour.

0:12:22.360,0:12:25.000
Real love forgets wrong!

0:12:25.000,0:12:26.200
I can't hear you.

0:12:26.200,0:12:28.000
Real love forgets wrong!

0:12:28.000,0:12:30.480
So that there is what?

0:12:30.480,0:12:34.820
So that there is hope for the future.

0:12:34.820,0:12:47.560
Real love ‎forgets wrong so that there is hope for the future. ‎

0:12:47.560,0:12:53.300
Jesus loves you.

0:12:53.300,0:13:00.460
To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎

0:13:00.460,0:13:01.480
Tell your neighbour.

0:13:01.480,0:13:11.760
To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎

0:13:11.760,0:13:13.040
Tell your neighbor again.

0:13:13.040,0:13:15.040
To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎

0:13:15.040,0:13:15.960
I can't hear you.

0:13:15.960,0:13:17.460
To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎

0:13:17.460,0:13:20.220
Do you know what I mean by getting out of your dry pit?

0:13:20.220,0:13:22.820
Your dry pit could be sickness,

0:13:22.820,0:13:24.820
your dry pit could be isolation,

0:13:24.820,0:13:30.560
your dry pit could be ‎poverty, hardship.

0:13:30.560,0:13:36.680
What is your dry pit? ‎

0:13:36.680,0:13:47.700
To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.

0:13:47.700,0:14:05.620
Whether you are wrong or right, no ‎one is permitted to hold on to an offence. ‎

0:14:05.620,0:14:18.600
Now you have received but don’t forget that to maintain this blessing, you need God.

0:14:18.600,0:14:22.800
Like my Evangelist said:

0:14:22.800,0:14:40.880
"The best man in the world can only maintain unless God protects."

0:14:40.880,0:14:50.460
It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall. ‎

0:14:50.460,0:14:51.280
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:51.280,0:14:59.560
It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.

0:14:59.560,0:15:04.220
This is your case.

0:15:04.220,0:15:12.020
It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.

0:15:12.020,0:15:17.700
You desire healing, you desire blessing.

0:15:17.700,0:15:30.060
He who desires victory must be ready for war.

0:15:30.060,0:15:38.340
You desire blessing, victory, protection, salvation, all of God’s ‎blessings.

0:15:38.340,0:15:45.560
He who desires victory must be ready for war.

0:15:45.560,0:15:57.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:57.900,0:15:59.680
Take it once again.

0:15:59.680,0:16:09.620
The best man in the world can only maintain unless God protects. ‎

0:16:09.620,0:16:13.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:13.160,0:16:14.640
Rise up. Thank you.

0:16:14.640,0:16:22.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:22.620,0:16:26.060
Ask your neighbour: What will you do with this little counsel?‎

0:16:26.060,0:16:27.840
What will you do with this little counsel?‎

0:16:27.840,0:16:28.840
Ask your neighbour.

0:16:28.840,0:16:30.840
What will you do with this little counsel?‎

0:16:30.840,0:16:32.040
Ask your neighbour.

0:16:32.040,0:16:33.780
What will you do with this little counsel?‎

0:16:33.780,0:16:36.600
Will you ask your neighbour a simple question?

0:16:36.600,0:16:38.600
What will you do with this little counsel?‎

0:16:38.600,0:16:41.700
That is it.

0:16:41.700,0:16:49.360
To maintain, you need God.

0:16:49.360,0:16:57.140
It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.

0:16:57.140,0:16:59.100
What will you do with this counsel?

0:16:59.100,0:17:13.120
You have heard that a good Christian should refuse to be ‎offended.‎

0:17:13.120,0:17:21.900
A good Christian should refuse to be offended because you don’t want to offend God.

0:17:21.900,0:17:28.000
The ‎reason why you have to refuse to be offended is because you don’t want to offend God. ‎

0:17:28.000,0:17:30.400
You can't hold offence and talk to God.

0:17:30.400,0:17:33.040
You can't hold offence and hear from God.

0:17:33.040,0:17:36.280
‎It is not possible.‎

0:17:36.280,0:17:40.340
Because when you hold offence, your spirit is not free

0:17:40.340,0:17:47.580
and your spirit needs to be free to ‎contact the Spirit of God.

0:17:47.580,0:17:57.640
When you hold an offence, your spirit is in bondage.

0:17:57.640,0:18:11.020
Your ‎spirit needs to be free to be sensitive to the Spirit of God. ‎

0:18:11.020,0:18:13.680
Just like the little example I gave you:

0:18:13.680,0:18:22.780
When you hold an offence, seeing yourself focus and ‎concentrate on the wrong done to you,

0:18:22.780,0:18:33.240
forgetting the condition in which you are.

0:18:33.240,0:18:35.540
It is not possible to talk about two things.

0:18:35.540,0:18:40.840
You can't be talking about failure and at the ‎same time talking about success.

0:18:40.840,0:18:46.460
Once you are focusing and concentrating on the wrong done to you,

0:18:46.460,0:18:51.360
the condition in ‎which you are is silent.

0:18:51.360,0:18:56.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:56.540,0:19:02.540
With all your heart, you have to receive.

0:19:02.540,0:19:10.860
When you talk with all your heart, the job is ‎half done.

0:19:10.860,0:19:19.220
When we start praying now and you begin to confess with all your heart, the job is half done.

0:19:19.220,0:19:22.720
You have scored fifty percent. ‎

0:19:22.720,0:19:24.500
Are you with me?

0:19:24.500,0:19:26.420
I want to repeat again.

0:19:26.420,0:19:33.980
When we say, "Okay, it is time to pray", and you begin to talk with all your ‎heart,

0:19:33.980,0:19:42.060
at that level, you have scored fifty percent, the job is half done. ‎

0:19:42.060,0:19:48.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:48.320,0:19:54.900
But how will you talk with all your heart when your heart is not free -

0:19:54.900,0:20:04.840
when you find ‎yourself a hostage, in self-imprisonment because of an unforgiving spirit?

0:20:04.840,0:20:19.880
You are carrying ‎anger, hatred, bitterness against someone. ‎

0:20:19.880,0:20:24.520
You are here in the presence of God, carrying an unforgiving spirit,

0:20:24.520,0:20:31.180
carrying hatred, bitterness, jealousy against someone somewhere,

0:20:31.180,0:20:34.560
and you want to receive from God.

0:20:34.560,0:20:40.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:40.020,0:20:44.580
God has already judged those who have offended you.

0:20:44.580,0:20:49.580
It is in that book when you read down: "Woe unto..."

0:20:49.580,0:20:51.940
Take your book and read.

0:20:51.940,0:20:54.540
He has judged already.

0:20:54.540,0:21:02.920
So, if God has laid judgment on those ‎who have offended you, why do you want to hassle?‎

0:21:02.920,0:21:04.100
It is there.

0:21:04.100,0:21:07.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:07.320,0:21:16.680
He said: "''...but woe to anyone through whom they come.'"

0:21:16.680,0:21:22.280
"Jesus said to His disciples: 'Things that cause ‎people to stumble are bound to come

0:21:22.280,0:21:28.260
but woe to anyone through whom they come.'"

0:21:28.260,0:21:30.660
What judgment again?

0:21:30.660,0:21:34.340
It is clear.‎

0:21:34.340,0:21:38.180
Below, the punishment has already been described there.

0:21:38.180,0:21:40.860
It is there when you read it ‎down. ‎

0:21:40.860,0:21:46.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:46.240,0:21:50.100
Are you free?

0:21:50.100,0:21:53.120
Are you free now?

0:21:53.120,0:22:15.620
Before now, we were carrying anger, bitterness, hurt, deep ‎pain, deep hurt against someone.

0:22:15.620,0:22:21.100
Make sure that you are free now so that we can proceed.

0:22:21.100,0:22:24.520
Because we are about to enter ‎another level. ‎

0:22:24.520,0:22:32.360
You know when a pilot is flying, he will tell you he is going up - above the level he is now.

0:22:32.360,0:22:36.700
We are going up now.

0:22:36.700,0:22:40.060
Whatever you need to do now; please, get yourself free.

0:22:40.060,0:22:42.760
You ‎need to be free.

0:22:42.760,0:22:45.660
It makes the job easier.

0:22:45.660,0:22:48.000
To be free is fifty percent.

0:22:48.000,0:22:56.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:56.220,0:23:17.580
You can open your lips and say, "Lord Jesus, come into my heart, wash me with your ‎precious blood". Prayer!

0:23:17.580,0:23:22.900
Viewers all over the world!

0:23:22.900,0:23:27.320
We need to be free to contact the Spirit of God.

0:23:27.320,0:23:33.140
If your spirit ‎is not free, you cannot contact the Spirit of God.

0:23:33.140,0:23:37.660
Right now, say a simple prayer.

0:23:37.660,0:23:49.160
Lord Jesus, come into my heart, wash ‎me with your precious blood, save my soul today.

0:23:49.160,0:23:51.160
Prayer, viewers!

0:23:51.160,0:23:59.820
Lord Jesus, come into my heart, wash ‎me with your precious blood, save my soul today.

0:23:59.820,0:24:04.660
Viewers, I need to say the reason because I have not talked to you yet.

0:24:04.660,0:24:07.460
Listen - this is a message to you:

0:24:07.460,0:24:18.880
As a good Christian, ‎you should refuse to be offended in order not to offend Jesus.

0:24:18.880,0:24:29.400
It is true! Jesus said to you that it is not possible to live in this world without offence.

0:24:29.400,0:24:37.940
But in ‎order not to offend God, you should refuse to be offended.

0:24:37.940,0:24:46.200
So please open your lips right ‎now and say this word: "Lord Jesus!"

0:24:46.200,0:24:48.360
You know that I am not calling you a sinner.

0:24:48.360,0:24:55.320
Lord Jesus, come into my heart!

0:24:55.320,0:24:58.920
Wash me ‎with your precious blood!

0:24:58.920,0:25:02.180
Save my soul today!

0:25:02.180,0:25:04.180
Prayer!

0:25:04.180,0:25:20.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:20.360,0:25:24.860
Viewers, listen to me!

0:25:24.860,0:25:36.700
When we feel offended, we begin to use our tongues out of bitterness and ‎anger.

0:25:36.700,0:25:51.000
We begin to use our tongues to split relationships, shatter marriages ‎and tear families apart.

0:25:51.000,0:25:57.120
We split the ministry, churches with our tongues.

0:25:57.120,0:26:02.900
In the tongue, death ‎and life, as the Book of Proverbs 18:21 says.

0:26:02.900,0:26:13.100
‎Right now, say: Lord Jesus, come into my heart,

0:26:13.100,0:26:16.360
wash me with your precious blood,

0:26:16.360,0:26:23.560
save my soul today!

0:26:23.560,0:26:25.560
Prayer!

0:26:38.720,0:26:48.200
Into my heart

Come in today

0:27:55.200,0:28:07.140
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus

0:28:07.140,0:28:16.840
Into my heart

0:28:16.840,0:28:28.160
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus

0:28:28.160,0:28:33.980
Come in to stay

0:28:33.980,0:28:39.340
Come in today

0:28:39.340,0:28:51.280
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus

0:28:51.280,0:29:02.060
Into my heart

0:29:02.060,0:29:13.960
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus

0:29:13.960,0:29:19.960
Come in to stay

0:29:19.960,0:29:26.280
Come in today

0:29:26.280,0:29:38.980
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus

0:29:41.860,0:29:45.160
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:29:45.160,0:29:54.180
Like I asked you - what is your dry pit?

0:29:54.180,0:30:01.560
When Joseph was in the dry pit, he said to himself, "This is not where I belong".

0:30:01.560,0:30:07.380
‎He was in the dry pit where there was no light, there was nothing.

0:30:07.380,0:30:14.920
He was there, saying to ‎himself what was in accordance with his dream and goal.

0:30:14.920,0:30:16.360
He had dreamt.

0:30:16.360,0:30:21.520
He knew what the vision was all ‎about for him.

0:30:21.520,0:30:29.180
He said to himself, "This is not where I belong. I know where I belong".

0:30:29.180,0:30:32.040
That statement comforted him.

0:30:32.040,0:30:34.780
You are supposed to be comforted ‎if you have a vision.

0:30:34.780,0:30:42.780
When we ‎‏say 'a poor man', it does not mean a man without money in the pocket but a man ‎without vision.

0:30:42.780,0:30:49.040
‎‏Whatever situation you are in, remember your dream and your goal.

0:30:49.040,0:30:50.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:30:50.040,0:30:55.200
Whatever situation you are in, remember your dream and your goal!

0:30:55.200,0:30:56.760
I can't hear you.

0:30:56.760,0:31:01.560
Whatever ‎‏situation you are in, remember your dream and your goal! ‎‏

0:31:01.560,0:31:10.720
When Joseph was in the dry pit, he said to himself, after remembering his dream and goal,

0:31:10.720,0:31:14.360
"This is ‎not ‎‏where I belong. I know where I belong!"

0:31:14.360,0:31:29.420
He laughed and said, "Ok, ok, ok! This is one of ‎‏the ten I will pass through to get to where I'm going".

0:31:29.420,0:31:40.000
Have you ever said to yourself before, standing in the face of storm and crisis,

0:31:40.000,0:31:46.260
"Hey, this is not where I belong. My dream does not suggest these.

0:31:46.260,0:31:49.680
This is not ‎where I belong! I ‎‏know where I belong!

0:31:49.680,0:32:02.280
Ok, just a stop-over. It is one of the states I must pass through.

0:32:02.280,0:32:08.480
It will not impair me but improve me!"

0:32:08.480,0:32:13.140
Your struggle will make you stronger.

0:32:13.140,0:32:20.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:20.320,0:32:22.780
Whoever asked yourself this?

0:32:22.780,0:32:24.680
But you never remember.

0:32:24.680,0:32:30.320
I mean, if you have a vision in your ‎dream, you ‎‏will remember.

0:32:30.320,0:32:45.680
Instead of lamenting, mourning, complaining, "Oh my God, ‎why this trouble?"

0:32:45.680,0:32:52.940
No! Remember your ‎goal and your dream whatever ‎‏the situation.

0:32:52.940,0:33:02.200
Joseph was in the dry pit and immediately that ‎situation reminded him of his dream and goal.

0:33:02.200,0:33:08.640
He said to himself, "Ah, I dreamt seeing a crown. I dreamt ‎wearing a crown.

0:33:08.640,0:33:10.920
I dreamt seeing myself on a throne.‏

0:33:10.920,0:33:16.080
This is not a throne. This is not where I ‎belong; I know where I belong!"

0:33:16.080,0:33:28.500
I know where I belong means, "Yes, I'm still going there!"

0:33:28.500,0:33:35.800
I know where I belong means, "Here ‎will ‎‏make me stronger!"

0:33:35.800,0:33:44.080
I know where I belong means, "This place will not impair me but improve me!"

0:33:44.080,0:33:49.680
Do you ever talk to yourself like that?

0:33:49.680,0:33:53.260
Each time you have no money, you begin to complain.

0:33:53.260,0:33:58.200
Each time there are challenges, you ‎begin to ‎‏complain.

0:33:58.200,0:34:01.200
‎‏You allow your situation to rule you.

0:34:01.200,0:34:06.000
You allow your situation to ‎dictate your direction.

0:34:06.000,0:34:24.420
Don't allow your situtation to rule you.

0:34:24.420,0:34:27.160
Tell your neighbour: "I know where I belong."

0:34:27.160,0:34:28.920
I know where I belong.

0:34:28.920,0:34:30.040
I can't hear you.

0:34:30.040,0:34:31.640
I know where I belong.

0:34:31.640,0:34:32.660
I can't hear you.

0:34:32.660,0:34:34.260
I know where I belong.

0:34:34.260,0:34:35.220
I can't hear you.

0:34:35.220,0:34:37.340
I know where I belong.

0:34:37.340,0:34:42.380
If you know where you belong, why are you complaining, murmuring?

0:34:42.380,0:34:46.640
Why are you lamenting over the ‎situation ‎you are in?

0:34:46.640,0:34:53.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:53.320,0:34:56.220
Why? Ask yourself.

0:34:56.220,0:35:03.120
If you know where you belong, that alone can give you joy and strength -

0:35:03.120,0:35:08.660
so much ‎strength to overlook the situation.

0:35:08.660,0:35:15.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:15.160,0:35:27.880
I say to you: He who desires victory must be ready for war.

0:35:27.880,0:35:31.480
So it is part of your war you ‎must ‎fight.

0:35:31.480,0:35:35.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:35.040,0:35:38.060
Are you with me?

0:35:38.060,0:35:40.680
Cancer can be part of the war.

0:35:40.680,0:35:46.160
Fever, setback, hardship, poverty, ‎‎disappointment

0:35:46.160,0:35:50.300
can be one of the ones you must fight to get to the throne.

0:35:50.300,0:35:58.780
Tell your neighbour: He who desires victory must be ready for ‎‎war.

0:35:58.780,0:36:06.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:06.040,0:36:14.760
When we say war, you may fight twenty wars to get to the throne, and you must ‎overcome each war.

0:36:14.760,0:36:20.520
If not, it ‎will give you setback.

0:36:20.520,0:36:23.360
You may fight twenty wars.

0:36:23.360,0:36:26.800
The ‎number of wars you fight may not be the number of wars I will fight.

0:36:26.800,0:36:30.360
You may fight twenty; I may fight hundred.

0:36:30.360,0:36:35.580
The nature of war you fight may not be the nature of war I ‎fight.

0:36:35.580,0:36:49.980
Yours can be ‎disappointment, hardship, people lying against you, going into prison and coming back.

0:36:49.980,0:36:55.060
It could be isolation, sickness, disease or affliction.

0:36:55.060,0:36:58.460
It could be that war you need to fight to get to the throne.

0:36:58.460,0:37:06.720
He who desires victory, he who desires a crown, he who desires to be in a palace

0:37:06.720,0:37:11.200
must be ‎ready to fight war.

0:37:11.200,0:37:17.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:17.620,0:37:21.720
Ask your neighbour: What is your present war now?

0:37:21.720,0:37:23.400
He should answer you; you should answer her.

0:37:23.400,0:37:28.140
What is your present war?

0:37:28.140,0:37:29.520
Answer your neighbour.

0:37:29.520,0:37:34.840
What is your present war?

0:37:34.840,0:37:43.540
Yours could be ‎disappointment, setback, hardship, hatred.

0:37:43.540,0:37:47.860
What is your present war?

0:37:47.860,0:37:52.460
Nothing comes for nothing and nothing happens by chance.

Joseph found himself ‎in the dry pit as a ‎part of the war he had to fight.

0:38:06.640,0:38:13.620
He fought it, overcame and moved forward.

0:38:13.620,0:38:17.580
From that dry pit - the pit was not the last war.

0:38:17.580,0:38:27.980
He still went ahead to fight.

0:38:27.980,0:38:32.620
The dry pit was not the last war Joseph fought to get to the throne.

0:38:32.620,0:38:35.080
Are you saying the dry pit was the last war?

0:38:35.080,0:38:36.540
No!

0:38:36.540,0:38:42.000
Why are you troubled and crying?

0:38:42.000,0:38:51.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:38:51.520,0:38:53.000
The dry pit was not the last war.

0:38:53.000,0:39:02.200
That was why he said, "I know where I belong! This is ‎not where I belong. I know where I ‎belong".

0:39:02.200,0:39:08.200
He knew he had more battles to fight.

0:39:08.200,0:39:16.660
But in each ‎war, each battle, he remembered his goal, his vision.

0:39:16.660,0:39:18.460
Tell your neighbour: "Remember your vision!"

0:39:18.460,0:39:19.840
Remember your vision.

0:39:19.840,0:39:20.920
I can't hear you.

0:39:20.920,0:39:22.380
Remember your vision.

0:39:22.380,0:39:26.860
Nothing is much more than your vision.

0:39:26.860,0:39:30.480
Nothing is much more ‎than your goal.

0:39:30.480,0:39:31.680
I can't hear you.

0:39:31.680,0:39:33.540
Nothing is much more ‎than your goal.

0:39:33.540,0:39:34.600
I can't hear you.

0:39:34.600,0:39:36.600
Nothing is much more ‎than your goal.

0:39:36.600,0:39:42.860
Nothing is much more ‎than your vision and your ‎goal.

0:39:42.860,0:39:44.060
Yes.

How can anybody that listened to that message still be complaining over the situation

0:40:14.080,0:40:17.380
when you know where ‎you belong!

0:40:17.380,0:40:22.700
You will soon leave that situation, the situation will soon leave ‎you.

0:40:22.700,0:40:23.400

You will leave the situation ‎and the situation will leave you.

0:40:30.620,0:40:33.180
You know ‎where you belong!

0:40:33.180,0:40:36.480
That is not where you belong.

0:40:36.480,0:40:39.260
Soldier on!

0:40:39.260,0:40:43.080
You will meet another situation after this.

0:40:43.080,0:40:49.820
You ‎will meet another ‎situation probably greater than the one you are facing now.

0:40:49.820,0:40:55.980
It determines the type of crown you are prepared for.

0:40:55.980,0:41:07.140
A greater crown ‎attracts greater persecution.

0:41:07.140,0:41:08.880
So, that is it.

0:41:08.880,0:41:15.680
You are talking as if this is the last war you will fight to get to the palace.

0:41:15.680,0:41:19.080
This is the way you talk now - as if you are fed up.

0:41:19.080,0:41:25.580
"This is the last battle" - I don't know whether this is the last battle you will fight to get to the palace,

0:41:25.580,0:41:27.800
to get to your destination.

0:41:27.800,0:41:33.400
Many of us don’t know what it means to say, "Joseph was in the dry pit".

0:41:33.400,0:41:35.620
That pit was ‎not the last battle. ‎

0:41:35.620,0:41:48.140
He left the dry pit and then soldiered on to another battle, ‎another greater situation.

0:41:48.140,0:41:53.500
We that maintain the relationship with God are enabled.

0:41:53.500,0:41:57.960
Anybody that maintains the relationship - if today you say, "I want to be a friend of God.

0:41:57.960,0:42:03.120
I want to be with God" - you will be enabled to endure.

0:42:03.120,0:42:04.880
There is a grace.

0:42:04.880,0:42:06.380
It maintains the ‎relationship.

0:42:06.380,0:42:15.880
If you confess genuinely and follow Him - not just like people ‎that confess, "Jesus is my Lord" -

0:42:15.880,0:42:18.540
there is a package for you.

0:42:18.540,0:42:23.780
No one follows Jesus without enablement.

0:42:23.780,0:42:29.340
The test and hardship that confront your daily life - there is enablement.

0:42:29.340,0:42:33.740
Enablement means strength, ability.

0:42:33.740,0:42:35.500
He doesn't leave us ‎just like that.

0:42:35.500,0:42:37.840
He has giving each and ‎everyone enablement.

0:42:37.840,0:42:39.140
Why should we complain?

0:42:39.140,0:42:44.380
When you follow Him, He gives you enablement.

0:42:44.380,0:42:47.720
You can't just follow Him without enablement.

0:42:47.720,0:42:54.500
That enablement is to give you endurance and ‎overcoming.

0:42:54.500,0:42:59.660
So ‎when you see people complaining, it means they are not genuinely born again.

0:42:59.660,0:43:04.240
If you are ‎genuinely ‎born again, there is enablement given to you -

0:43:04.240,0:43:10.580
that is ability, strength, given to ‎you to be His children

0:43:10.580,0:43:14.780
and that ‎enablement will give you endurance.

0:43:14.780,0:43:21.520
That enablement ‎will give you power to overcome.

0:43:21.520,0:43:36.020
It was that ‎enablement that gave Joseph endurance, ‎to endure the situation in the dry pit.

0:43:36.020,0:43:41.640
If not, he would have died there, not enduring the situation in the dry pit.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:48.440,0:43:54.860
You are living and talking as if the life you live is yours.

0:43:54.860,0:44:02.640
Once you are born again, the ‎life you are living is ‎not yours but Christ's.

0:44:02.640,0:44:05.500
It means that when you are born again, you follow ‎Christ.

0:44:05.500,0:44:10.320
It means that someone is somewhere seeing ‎you through.

0:44:10.320,0:44:14.080
Someone is somewhere fighting for you.

0:44:14.080,0:44:17.700
Someone is somewhere protecting you.

0:44:17.700,0:44:22.740
You may not see it but He is somewhere seeing you.

0:44:22.740,0:44:27.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:44:27.220,0:44:31.280
Can you be bold enough to say, "I know where I belong!"

0:44:31.280,0:44:33.180
I know where I belong.

0:44:33.180,0:44:34.200
Do you know the meaning?

0:44:34.200,0:44:42.540
It means that the situation you are in now, is not yours.

0:44:42.540,0:44:47.140
You will soon get out of that and move forward.

0:44:47.140,0:44:49.620
Say to yourself, "I know where I belong".

0:44:49.620,0:44:51.720
I know where I belong.

0:44:51.720,0:44:54.920
Where you belong - that is ‎the question.

0:44:54.920,0:44:58.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:44:58.640,0:45:07.240
So ‎please, you need to talk to yourself.

0:45:07.240,0:45:14.640
Talking to yourself is better ‎than even a pastor talking to you.

0:45:14.640,0:45:17.320
You are not used to talking to yourself.

0:45:17.320,0:45:21.560
I am talking to you but if you ‎talk to yourself with all your heart,

0:45:21.560,0:45:25.940
it is more powerful ‎than a pastor talking to you.

0:45:25.940,0:45:29.000
You need ‎to talk to yourself.

0:45:29.000,0:45:40.300
When you get home today, you need to ‎meditate over and over the message you received today.

0:45:40.500,0:45:46.280
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
