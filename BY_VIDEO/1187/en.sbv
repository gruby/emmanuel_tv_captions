0:00:00.000,0:00:02.160
You have the spirit of anger.

0:00:02.160,0:00:02.720
Yes.

0:00:02.720,0:00:05.600
This spirit of anger keeps destroying your home.

0:00:05.600,0:00:08.060
Yes, sir.

0:00:08.060,0:00:10.860
Take it easy; there is a fast they asked you to do.

0:00:10.860,0:00:11.580
Yes, sir.

0:00:11.580,0:00:13.160
You did not do it at all.

0:00:13.160,0:00:14.140
Yes, sir.

0:00:14.140,0:00:16.140
They asked you to fast for two days.

0:00:16.140,0:00:19.580
The prophecy you gave is that I have a spirit of anger.

0:00:19.580,0:00:24.340
Because of that, I lock my husband when we are fighting and tear his clothes.

0:00:24.340,0:00:26.360
Please, Man of God, deliver me.

0:00:26.360,0:00:30.680
I lock my husband and tear his clothes when the spirit comes.

0:00:30.680,0:00:33.680
What did I tell you? I said the anger has destroyed your home.

0:00:33.680,0:00:36.280
Yes, sir.

0:00:36.280,0:00:42.980
Anybody who sees you sees a beautiful woman but you're going through a thorough punishment.

0:00:42.980,0:00:43.800
Yes, sir.

0:00:43.800,0:00:45.380
Anger.

0:00:45.380,0:00:47.140
Yes, sir; I do cry.

0:00:47.140,0:00:48.420
Where is your husband?

0:00:48.420,0:00:49.800
My husband is in the church.

0:00:49.800,0:00:52.660
- Can you go and call your husband.
- Mr Godwin, come out.

0:00:52.660,0:00:56.800
Prophecy Confirmation

0:00:56.800,0:00:59.380
Man of God, what you said about my wife is true.

0:00:59.380,0:01:03.380
Any time she is fighting with me, she will hold my clothes and hold my penis.

0:01:03.380,0:01:04.920
Then I will beg her.

0:01:04.920,0:01:06.880
Man of God, please deliver us.

0:01:06.880,0:01:09.480
Man of God, help me. She always fights me.

0:01:09.480,0:01:11.760
Any time we fight, I will beg her.

0:01:11.760,0:01:14.420
She will hold my clothes and tear my clothes; she will not allow me to go out.

0:01:14.420,0:01:15.380
And hold your what?

0:01:15.380,0:01:16.160
My penis.

0:01:16.160,0:01:19.040
Man of God, sometimes he will go out to drink.

0:01:19.040,0:01:22.340
When he comes back, I will be angry that he went out.

0:01:22.340,0:01:24.800
You can't find any other place to hold.

0:01:24.800,0:01:26.740
Prophecy Confirmation

0:01:26.740,0:01:32.260
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:32.260,0:01:34.920
I want to see you people. It's alright; it's over.

0:01:34.920,0:01:42.020
The danger there is that you locked your husband inside and you locked it with the key.

0:01:42.020,0:01:42.680
Yes, sir.

0:01:42.680,0:01:44.100
For what?

0:01:44.100,0:01:47.980
If that anger came, sir - but I know I am free today; it won't happen again.

0:01:47.980,0:01:50.340
That is not what I am asking you.

0:01:50.340,0:01:54.660
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:54.660,0:01:58.080
My name is Mrs Godwin Iyan Okoh.

0:01:58.080,0:02:01.500
I'm from Ebonyi state; I reside in Osun state.

0:02:01.500,0:02:03.840
The person beside me is my husband.

0:02:03.840,0:02:09.040
The other ones are my children.

0:02:09.040,0:02:13.820
The prophecy the man of God gave to me last Sunday was 100% true.

0:02:13.820,0:02:17.580
I had a spirit of anger, just like the man of God said.

0:02:17.580,0:02:20.540
That spirit of anger has destroyed my home.

0:02:20.540,0:02:24.180
When the spirit came, I would fight my husband.

0:02:24.180,0:02:27.400
When we started fighting, I would want my husband to wound me

0:02:27.400,0:02:29.340
before I would leave him to go.

0:02:29.340,0:02:33.780
When the spirit came over me, I would like to fight my husband,

0:02:33.780,0:02:37.860
tear his clothes, his trousers.

0:02:37.860,0:02:45.240
I would then hold his manhood so that he would kill me before escaping.

0:02:45.240,0:02:48.260
That must have been a very serious spirit of anger.

0:02:48.260,0:02:51.340
As the woman said, it nearly destroyed the home.

0:02:51.340,0:02:58.440
Can you share with us more of the kind of fighting that occurred between you and your husband.

0:02:58.440,0:03:02.920
This fighting started since we got married.

0:03:02.920,0:03:08.000
Sometimes, we would fight every week, every month.

0:03:08.000,0:03:12.340
When I was still having a child with him, I would fight with him.

0:03:12.340,0:03:16.040
When my kids were still small, we would fight.

0:03:16.040,0:03:21.560
It is just my two sons that would witness and still recollect how we would fight.

0:03:21.560,0:03:26.160
If we wanted to fight, I would look my husband into the room.

0:03:26.160,0:03:30.340
I would tell my husband, "If you don't kill me, you are not going anywhere".

0:03:30.340,0:03:36.060
My husband would start beating me, hitting me so that he would then escape.

0:03:36.060,0:03:39.880
Immediately the spirit left me, I would say, "I will not do that again".

0:03:39.880,0:03:42.160
But when the spirit came, I would fight.

0:03:42.160,0:03:45.960
It would normally start when he went out to drink.

0:03:45.960,0:03:49.980
When he came back, I would start being angry with him.

0:03:49.980,0:03:56.000
Ok. You said something that you even used to lock your husband and yourself in the room.

0:03:56.000,0:03:58.720
What did you do with the key when you locked the door?

0:03:58.720,0:04:01.460
When I locked the door, I would throw the key (away).

0:04:01.460,0:04:04.660
Both of us wouldn't find where the key was.

0:04:04.660,0:04:08.460
But when he beat me, sometimes, he would just see the key in time.

0:04:08.460,0:04:13.700
He might open the door or sometimes, he would use his leg to break the door and run out.

0:04:13.700,0:04:20.680
So that was how the spirit of anger had caused this problem and disunity in the home.

0:04:20.680,0:04:27.780
Yes. Even when the spirit came and my children were still small, I would beat, hit them.

0:04:27.780,0:04:32.980
My second son was even telling me at a certain time, "Mummy, you have changed.

0:04:32.980,0:04:37.960
You don't beat us again. You don't play karate again".

0:04:37.960,0:04:42.040
During the times you were having this disunity as a result of this spirit of anger

0:04:42.040,0:04:44.860
that caused a constant fight between you and your husband,

0:04:44.860,0:04:50.080
were there some efforts put in place to bring about settlement between you and your husband

0:04:50.080,0:04:52.720
before you finally received your deliverance last week Sunday?

0:04:52.720,0:04:58.920
Yes. My husband's mother and family would call us that we should stop fighting;

0:04:58.920,0:05:01.640
that this thing we were doing was not good;

0:05:01.640,0:05:07.100
that if we continued fighting like this and separated, what would happen to the kids.

0:05:07.100,0:05:10.840
My mother-in-law would plead with me that I should calm down.

0:05:10.840,0:05:14.060
When my mother-in-law finished talking to me, I would accept.

0:05:14.060,0:05:18.900
But when the spirit came again, I would start and not even remember what she said to me again.

0:05:18.900,0:05:24.400
That means it was a spirit you could not control as she said that our fight is not carnal

0:05:24.400,0:05:27.480
and it was only God that could deliver this family.

0:05:27.480,0:05:33.900
That was what happened last week Sunday and it all came through the power of prophecy.

0:05:33.900,0:05:37.640
My name is Godwin Iyan Okoh. I'm from Obonyi state.

0:05:37.640,0:05:42.180
This is my lovely wife and these are my children.

0:05:42.180,0:05:47.880
According to the prophecy of last week - the prophecy is 100% true

0:05:47.880,0:05:50.680
because my wife had the spirit of anger.

0:05:50.680,0:05:53.960
I myself had the spirit of drinking.

0:05:53.960,0:05:56.640
Sometimes, I would go out to drink.

0:05:56.640,0:06:01.360
When I came back, my wife wouldn't be happy.

0:06:01.360,0:06:06.020
As a man, I would try to tell her that I was the owner of the house;

0:06:06.020,0:06:09.100
that she couldn't control me.

0:06:09.100,0:06:12.640
From there, we would be fighting.

0:06:12.640,0:06:17.700
Sometimes, she would tear my clothes and hold my penis.

0:06:17.700,0:06:19.700
She would not allow me to go out.

0:06:19.700,0:06:22.480
To the extent, that one day, she locked the door.

0:06:22.480,0:06:25.320
I didn't know where she dropped the key.

0:06:25.320,0:06:26.800
She said I must kill her.

0:06:26.800,0:06:30.300
I then used my leg to break the door.

0:06:30.300,0:06:35.140
Sometimes, after begging her, she would open the door.

0:06:35.140,0:06:39.340
So this was how the spirit disturbed our marriage.

0:06:39.340,0:06:40.840
So let's ask your wife.

0:06:40.840,0:06:46.280
How did you normally feel during this time you engaged your husband in those fights?

0:06:46.280,0:06:49.500
When the spirit came, I couldn't control myself.

0:06:49.500,0:06:52.640
Nobody could tell me something I would accept.

0:06:52.640,0:06:55.540
I liked it when the two of us were fighting.

0:06:55.540,0:06:59.740
After the fighting, I would say, "Ah, why did I do this?"

0:06:59.740,0:07:02.420
I would tell myself, "I will not do this again".

0:07:02.420,0:07:05.940
The spirit would still torment me to fight.

0:07:05.940,0:07:10.280
But ever since the man of God gave these words of prophecy to you last week Sunday

0:07:10.280,0:07:11.940
and went on to deliver you and your husband,

0:07:11.940,0:07:17.140
can you tell us the changes you have seen in your life and your marriage?

0:07:17.140,0:07:21.220
The spirit has left me; we are living fine.

0:07:21.220,0:07:23.760
It is like the first day we met.

0:07:23.760,0:07:29.480
Ladies that are here, the first day you met your husband, you know how it is.

0:07:29.480,0:07:32.340
Hallelujah. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:07:32.340,0:07:36.960
I said, put your hands together for Jesus!

0:07:36.960,0:07:42.460
We should give glory to God for this power of prophecy through His anointed one, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:07:42.460,0:07:48.260
If not for the power of prophecy that revealed the problem in this marriage,

0:07:48.260,0:07:51.440
we know, as the woman said, it would have destroyed the home

0:07:51.440,0:07:53.960
and we know what the consequences would have been.

0:07:53.960,0:07:56.220
And look at the beautiful family we are seeing today.

0:07:56.220,0:08:00.260
They would not have been here today to share this wonderful testimony

0:08:00.260,0:08:03.860
with the children of God, if not for the power of prophecy.

0:08:03.860,0:08:10.300
Once again, shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:08:10.300,0:08:16.440
Since last week, it is as if we just wedded.

0:08:16.440,0:08:25.380
Since then, she has changed.

0:08:25.380,0:08:26.740
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:26.740,0:08:33.360
Hallelujah. Once again, put your hands together for Jesus!

0:08:33.360,0:08:38.020
You also talked about the spirit of drinking.

0:08:38.020,0:08:41.840
Ever since you received your deliverance, what can you say concerning that?

0:08:41.840,0:08:54.820
My sister, in fact, before, every day I had to drink something - like 3-4 bottles in a day.

0:08:54.820,0:08:59.380
But since last Sunday - even the church I was going to before at my place,

0:08:59.380,0:09:02.780
I would be in the church and pretend as if I was going to urinate.

0:09:02.780,0:09:11.560
I would take (a drink) but now, that spirit has left me - the spirit of drinking.

0:09:11.560,0:09:15.040
What kind of drink did you use to take then?

0:09:15.040,0:09:19.860
My sister, we have many people here that were drinking before.

0:09:19.860,0:09:23.680
We have different types of drinks in the town - alcohol.

0:09:23.680,0:09:29.340
So we have just heard from our brother that he was into this drinking of alcohol

0:09:29.340,0:09:31.640
and he took many bottles in a day.

0:09:31.640,0:09:34.660
But not only was peace restored into the marriage,

0:09:34.660,0:09:39.640
he was also delivered from that spirit of drinking - drunkenness.

0:09:39.640,0:09:43.500
And since that deliverance last week Sunday, it is a week now.

0:09:43.500,0:09:45.200
Have you ever tasted alcohol?

0:09:45.200,0:09:47.800
No, I have not.

0:09:47.800,0:09:53.320
So ever since your deliverance, do you still have that urge to drink?

0:09:53.320,0:09:54.840
Not at all.

0:09:54.840,0:09:59.020
Hallelujah. We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful deliverance

0:09:59.020,0:10:01.280
that has taken place in this family.

0:10:01.280,0:10:03.600
My name is Uchechukwu Iyan.

0:10:03.600,0:10:08.300
I'm the first son of Mr Godwin - my parents.

0:10:08.300,0:10:10.820
Back then, it used to be terrible.

0:10:10.820,0:10:15.420
Every time they started fighting, all our neighbours used to come around.

0:10:15.420,0:10:17.420
It was always very terrible.

0:10:17.420,0:10:22.420
Our landlord would have to call to speak to them.

0:10:22.420,0:10:25.280
Some nights, my dad wouldn't sleep at home.

0:10:25.280,0:10:28.760
He would go out to drink and after the fight like that, he would just leave.

0:10:28.760,0:10:32.640
But now, everything has changed; there is peace in the family right now.

0:10:32.640,0:10:38.040
We are hearing from the children themselves. Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:10:38.040,0:10:40.140
My name is Iyan Uchechukwu.

0:10:40.140,0:10:42.500
These are my brothers and those are my parents.

0:10:42.500,0:10:46.700
I can confirm the prophecy that the man of God gave to my mother about anger.

0:10:46.700,0:10:51.240
When I was very young, I remember vividly that one day, my dad just came back home,

0:10:51.240,0:10:56.720
took the television set and smashed it on the floor - just like that.

0:10:56.720,0:10:58.760
I think it was because they quarrelled in the morning.

0:10:58.760,0:11:01.860
So all these things were going on and it was embarrassing for us.

0:11:01.860,0:11:04.940
Like going to school, our parents were always fighting and all these kinds of things.

0:11:04.940,0:11:08.260
I thank God that after last week, everything has been okay

0:11:08.260,0:11:09.840
and there has been peace in the family.

0:11:09.840,0:11:12.020
I give glory to God. Emmanuel!

0:11:12.020,0:11:16.380
Mr & Mrs Godwin Iyan Okoh & Family

Please, those who have this kind of problem - trust in God.

0:11:24.200,0:11:26.280
God will see you through one day.

0:11:26.280,0:11:29.600
Continue praying; don't leave God, in Jesus' name.

0:11:29.600,0:11:32.300
The word of advice I have for the world is:

0:11:32.300,0:11:36.520
If you are having any problem, just have faith in God.

0:11:36.520,0:11:40.880
One day, God will see you through as He has seen my family through, in Jesus' name.

0:11:40.880,0:11:43.960
So you have heard a word of advice from the couple,

0:11:43.960,0:11:46.340
advising all to have faith in God.

0:11:46.340,0:11:49.820
Whatever problem you may be having, God is more than able to see you through.

0:11:49.820,0:11:53.180
We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful thing He has done in your family -

0:11:53.180,0:11:57.060
for this restoration of peace, harmony and unity in the family.

0:11:57.060,0:11:59.680
We just want to advise you that you should make sure

0:11:59.680,0:12:01.980
you continue to stay true to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ

0:12:01.980,0:12:04.360
and make His Word the standard for your life

0:12:04.360,0:12:08.280
and we know that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.

0:12:08.280,0:12:11.400
Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
