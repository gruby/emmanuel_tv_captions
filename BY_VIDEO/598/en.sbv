0:00:08.060,0:00:11.240
You and Prophet T.B Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,

0:00:11.240,0:00:15.300
can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.

0:00:15.300,0:00:16.760

0:00:20.200,0:00:22.700
I want to pray with the viewers right now

0:00:22.700,0:00:27.140
Those who are under the influence of my voice.

0:00:27.140,0:00:30.240
Whatever situation that you are in,

0:00:30.240,0:00:35.460
I say, be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:35.460,0:00:40.660
Viewers all over the world, whatever situation that you are in -

0:00:40.660,0:00:44.560
it is not the will of God.

0:00:44.560,0:00:47.960
Be released, in theme of Jesus!

0:00:47.960,0:00:56.340
It is the will of God to release you and I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:56.340,0:00:59.400
Listen, the voice of God says -

0:00:59.400,0:01:03.320
you are released, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:03.320,0:01:05.640
The voice of God says -

0:01:05.640,0:01:10.580
you are released, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:10.580,0:01:15.500
Yes, I will not blame you, that you are doubting.

0:01:15.500,0:01:18.380
Your doubt will not change anything.

0:01:18.380,0:01:21.620
Viewers, listen!  You are doubting that;

0:01:21.620,0:01:25.520
‘Is that how I will be released? I have suffered so much’.

0:01:25.520,0:01:29.120
I say, you are released, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:29.120,0:01:32.640
Your doubt will not change anything.

0:01:32.640,0:01:40.780
Be released!

0:01:40.780,0:01:48.860
Whatever the situation – it could be hardship, setback, depression, affliction,

0:01:48.860,0:01:53.380
I say, be released in the name of Jesus!

0:01:53.380,0:02:02.420
I can see you being released.

0:02:02.420,0:02:06.780
A prophet says he can see you being released.

0:02:06.780,0:02:09.340
Viewers, what does this mean to you?

0:02:09.340,0:02:13.160
I want to hear from you, what does this mean to you?

0:02:13.160,0:02:16.460
What does it mean to you?

0:02:16.460,0:02:24.900
If you honour a prophet because he is a prophet of God,

0:02:24.900,0:02:29.020
you will receive his reward.

0:02:29.020,0:02:34.240
A prophet says right now, you are released.

0:02:34.240,0:02:37.600
What does it mean to you?

0:02:37.600,0:02:41.560
You are delivered.
What does it mean to you?

0:02:41.560,0:02:45.120
You are healed.
What does it mean to you?

0:02:45.120,0:02:48.540
You are free.
What does it mean to you?

0:02:48.540,0:02:52.160
You are saved.
What does it mean to you?

0:02:52.160,0:03:01.240
In Jesus' name!

0:03:01.240,0:03:02.440
Yes!

0:03:02.440,0:03:05.020
That is the confession God wants to hear -

0:03:05.020,0:03:08.400
that when a prophet says you are released, what does it mean to you?

0:03:08.400,0:03:12.060
You say, you are released. That is all.

0:03:12.060,0:03:15.980
From your mouth, faith comes.

0:03:15.980,0:03:19.920
'Yes, yes' - comes faith.

0:03:19.920,0:03:25.280
'No, no' - comes doubt.

0:03:25.280,0:03:29.260
We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again

0:03:29.260,0:03:36.360
Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God as you send your testimony

0:03:36.360,0:03:42.460
