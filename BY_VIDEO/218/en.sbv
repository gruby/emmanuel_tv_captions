0:00:00.000,0:00:01.700
How are you?

0:00:01.700,0:00:04.180
Where is your wife?

0:00:04.180,0:00:05.520
I've got no wife now.

0:00:05.520,0:00:09.620
This is why I am asking you because this is the second time now.

0:00:09.620,0:00:12.860
If I marry, they run away.

0:00:12.860,0:00:16.380
Prophecy Time

0:00:16.380,0:00:21.240
That is why I met you and that is the greatest challenge you are facing now.

0:00:21.240,0:00:23.400
You have been lonely for some time now.

0:00:23.400,0:00:25.100
Almost 20 years.

0:00:25.100,0:00:26.880
That is what I am saying.

0:00:26.880,0:00:28.640
I am living in England.

0:00:28.640,0:00:31.460
I brought two to England; they ran away.

0:00:31.460,0:00:32.140
They run away?

0:00:32.140,0:00:34.600
The one I married in Nigeria, I brought her there and she ran away.

0:00:34.600,0:00:37.640
They run away - almost four now.

0:00:37.640,0:00:40.320
You see! So that's why I am just a loner.

0:00:40.320,0:00:42.900
But there is a court case.

0:00:42.900,0:00:44.360
I want to advise you.

0:00:44.360,0:00:47.480
They had dismissed the case in the past.

0:00:47.480,0:00:48.400
Yes.

0:00:48.400,0:00:53.920
OK. I don't want to say more than that because I don't want anything to distort the case on the ground.

0:00:53.920,0:00:55.500
I will see you one on one.

0:00:55.500,0:00:57.540
Come here.

0:00:57.540,0:00:58.840
Come on.

0:00:58.840,0:01:03.820
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:03.820,0:01:05.900
There was a test doctor did for you.

0:01:05.900,0:01:07.480
Yes.

0:01:07.480,0:01:08.880
Is it prostate?

0:01:08.880,0:01:10.700
It is prostate.

0:01:10.700,0:01:16.980
Prophecy Time

0:01:16.980,0:01:18.640
Go and wait for me.

0:01:18.640,0:01:20.420
I see this is the third time now.

0:01:20.420,0:01:26.360
There was a heat, energy, light they blew into your anus.

0:01:26.360,0:01:27.060
Yes.

0:01:27.060,0:01:28.200
They said they wanted to...

0:01:28.200,0:01:29.960
You have been battling with it for some time now.

0:01:29.960,0:01:31.460
Yes, I have been praying over it.

0:01:31.460,0:01:34.300
They could have operated on me but I said I did not want the operation.

0:01:34.300,0:01:35.100
That is what I am saying.

0:01:35.100,0:01:37.480
I said they would have operated you but you said no.

0:01:37.480,0:01:41.140
Don't worry.
Go and wait for me.

0:01:41.140,0:01:47.840
After receiving the word of prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua, Mr. Emmanuel came back to The SCOAN

0:01:47.840,0:01:53.880
with his family to be reconciled by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:53.880,0:01:57.900
As a communicator between the visible and the invisible Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:57.900,0:02:02.340
exposed the root cause of Mr. Emmanuel's problems through the word of prophecy

0:02:02.340,0:02:04.600
given to him by God Almighty.

0:02:04.600,0:02:08.520
Let's listen to Mr. Emmanuel as he confirms the prophecy.

0:02:08.520,0:02:14.060
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:14.060,0:02:18.600
And that is my name too, Emmanuel.

0:02:18.600,0:02:22.460
My story is as big as this church.

0:02:22.460,0:02:29.440
My name is Emmanuel Nwoye Okpoko.

0:02:29.440,0:02:31.700
I live in UK.

0:02:31.700,0:02:41.660
I have lived there for 22 years and there is nothing to show for it.

0:02:41.660,0:02:49.920
These people are my sons and my grandchildren there.

0:02:49.920,0:03:01.380
That woman there is my ex-wife.|

0:03:01.380,0:03:13.200
Since 34 years that I separated from this woman, I saw her here in The SCOAN for the first time.

0:03:13.200,0:03:22.600
I never knew it could be possible.

0:03:22.600,0:03:28.920
Last Sunday, the man of God gave me a prophecy.

0:03:28.920,0:03:33.920
He said that I had married and re-married and that I've gotten three wives.

0:03:33.920,0:03:40.620
He then asked me where my wife was and I said I didn't have one because really, I have none.

0:03:40.620,0:03:50.740
I told him that if I married, they would run away as if I was the ugliest man in the world.

0:03:50.740,0:03:57.500
It all started when I wanted to get married.

0:03:57.500,0:04:08.620
I was not actually in love with my ex-wife; it was my mother's arrangement.

0:04:08.620,0:04:16.760
She said I was going to marry the lady.

0:04:16.760,0:04:29.160
I didn't know her but for me to respect my mother's decision, for me to make my mother happy,

0:04:29.160,0:04:30.320
I had to marry her.

0:04:30.320,0:04:35.020
Actually, when I married her, we were going fine.

0:04:35.020,0:04:41.220
Things were going fine until I started making money.

0:04:41.220,0:04:47.620
I was into transport business and I started flourishing.

0:04:47.620,0:04:52.380
I bought trailers and that was where the trouble started.

0:04:52.380,0:04:58.360
I can remember, she used to go to the saloon and I got some experience there.

0:04:58.360,0:05:02.200
She would tell me to sign blank cheques for her

0:05:02.200,0:05:10.040
so that she could put and figure she liked on my cheques and withdraw money.

0:05:10.040,0:05:14.200
I asked her where she got that idea from.

0:05:14.200,0:05:17.680
So, trouble started.

0:05:17.680,0:05:25.620
"Where did you get that, that I should sign a blank cheque for you to put any figure you like?"

0:05:25.620,0:05:27.640
I thought it was a joke.

0:05:27.640,0:05:39.120
The hatred increased; there was no month we were in peace.

0:05:39.120,0:05:41.480
To cut the story short...

0:05:41.480,0:05:46.020
I had two ships at Tin Can Wharf for clearing.

0:05:46.020,0:05:48.720
My wharf managers were already there.

0:05:48.720,0:05:53.300
I was carrying my briefcase to put inside my car to go to work.

0:05:53.300,0:05:58.420
All my sons were young then but they knew what happened.

0:05:58.420,0:06:12.160
As I was about to enter the car, she pulled my briefcase and said, "Don't you know that you daughter is sick

0:06:12.160,0:06:14.200
and you don’t care, you are going to work?"

0:06:14.200,0:06:20.540
I told her that I had introduced a doctor to her, if any of our children were sick

0:06:20.540,0:06:27.700
she should take them there for treatment and he would keep my bill for me.

0:06:27.700,0:06:28.760
She asked me, "Why?"

0:06:28.760,0:06:31.300
From there, trouble started.

0:06:31.300,0:06:35.440
And then... she run outside...

0:06:35.440,0:06:38.920
She held me and fought me.

0:06:38.920,0:06:44.200
She was very big at that time.

0:06:44.200,0:06:46.140
I was struggling with her.

0:06:46.140,0:06:47.800
Imagine if a woman would have beaten me.

0:06:47.800,0:06:53.900
I had to stand on my feet and hit her hard.

0:06:53.900,0:07:02.600
She fell down and when she got up, she broke the windscreen of my car

0:07:02.600,0:07:06.220
in the front and back and then, ran away.

0:07:06.220,0:07:13.560
Obviously, I couldn't control myself so, I took my cutlass.

0:07:13.560,0:07:14.320
Yes.

0:07:14.320,0:07:24.540
She was lucky that I didn't get her; only God knows what would've happened that day.

0:07:24.540,0:07:26.840
After that day, I couldn't take it anymore.

0:07:26.840,0:07:31.040
I told my brother to go and get a large vehicle

0:07:31.040,0:07:35.720
and pack anything she touched inside it and let her take it home

0:07:35.720,0:07:38.540
even though she did not have a dime in my house.

0:07:38.540,0:07:43.100
Anything she touched...

0:07:43.100,0:07:49.560
Then, I took all of my boys and put them in Santana Private Primary School

0:07:49.560,0:07:51.380
where I visited them every two weeks.

0:07:51.380,0:07:58.700
I was a single father; I brought up these children single- handedly.

0:07:58.700,0:08:00.400
Now, anywhere I go...

0:08:00.400,0:08:03.220
I am so emotional.

0:08:03.220,0:08:14.740
Anywhere I went, they were pointing that this was the woman destroying my life.

0:08:14.740,0:08:18.280
Any business I put together, nothing worked.

0:08:18.280,0:08:22.560
The whole thing had affected my children.

0:08:22.560,0:08:28.280
My children, these boys that you see, survived by God's mercy.

0:08:28.280,0:08:41.780
Nobody is a fraudster or thief; they are just good children.

0:08:41.780,0:08:51.200
Imagine a father leaving a country for 22 years and my children were on their own.

0:08:51.200,0:08:53.520
Why should I be happy?

0:08:53.520,0:08:56.220
I had no wife.

0:08:56.220,0:09:03.060
If I married, they ran away and they said it was the same woman who was doing the whole thing - Theresa.

0:09:03.060,0:09:04.300
Look at my granddaughter.

0:09:04.300,0:09:05.440
I had never seen her.

0:09:05.440,0:09:13.880
I only saw her two days ago.

0:09:13.880,0:09:18.000
Look at my other granddaughter.

0:09:18.000,0:09:22.860
She punished me.

0:09:22.860,0:09:29.860
In England, I went everywhere.

0:09:29.860,0:09:33.480
There was no witchdoctor I had not gone to.

0:09:33.480,0:09:39.420
In short, there was nothing else I could do

0:09:39.420,0:09:44.240
until a friend introduced me to The SCOAN.

0:09:44.240,0:09:56.420
My son is a very successful businessman but it is always one step forward and three steps back.

0:09:56.420,0:10:03.600
When he told me, I said that if I returned to Nigeria, I would butcher this woman.

0:10:03.600,0:10:09.740
I would use my cutlass.

0:10:09.740,0:10:17.440
If she didn't die through juju (charms), I would use my cutlass to kill her.

0:10:17.440,0:10:24.540
My son told me that it was better that I come down.

0:10:24.540,0:10:29.300
I told him that I didn't have enough money but he said I should just come.

0:10:29.300,0:10:33.000
He said I should go and check how much a ticket cost.

0:10:33.000,0:10:37.160
I checked the price and before I knew it, he had paid money into my account.

0:10:37.160,0:10:40.440
Without telling anybody, I could not buy anything.

0:10:40.440,0:10:43.220
I wondered what I would do to my children and grandchildren.

0:10:43.220,0:10:46.800
He told me that shopping was not important at this point.

0:10:46.800,0:10:49.720
He had never been to any church.

0:10:49.720,0:10:53.720
If I told him about The SCOAN, he would be laughing at me.

0:10:53.720,0:10:58.180
He told me that he had heard a lot of things about The SCOAN.

0:10:58.180,0:11:03.020
He said that nothing worked and that everyone should defend themselves.

0:11:03.020,0:11:10.420
When I came on the 18th, I came to The SCOAN on Sunday.

0:11:10.420,0:11:14.320
As I sat down there, I couldn't believe my eyes.

0:11:14.320,0:11:27.660
The second person that the man of God touched was me.

0:11:27.660,0:11:31.140
He hit the nail on the head and told me all my problems.

0:11:31.140,0:11:33.420
I had done so many operations.

0:11:33.420,0:11:38.080
I told the doctor concerning my prostate that I would never operate it,

0:11:38.080,0:11:43.320
that I had to pray over it because I knew it was dangerous.

0:11:43.320,0:11:48.480
He hit the nail on the head and then told me to bring my whole family

0:11:48.480,0:11:53.960
because there were more things to be revealed.

0:11:53.960,0:12:01.300
I never knew the woman would agree to come to The SCOAN.

0:12:01.300,0:12:05.060
I have two daughters in England, both of them are nurses.

0:12:05.060,0:12:10.480
The oldest one asked me if it was sure that their mother would come.

0:12:10.480,0:12:17.400
I said I didn't know but if she didn't come, I would tell Prophet T.B. Joshua that she is at large

0:12:17.400,0:12:19.500
and he would make her to come.

0:12:19.500,0:12:22.380
That was what I had in mind.

0:12:22.380,0:12:30.060
When I came to Nigeria, I asked my son if he could take me to The SCOAN.

0:12:30.060,0:12:33.180
He said he would give me his driver.

0:12:33.180,0:12:45.100
He gave me his driver and I came to the church early in the morning.

0:12:45.100,0:12:54.620
I told my son what the man of God had said and he said he would follow me.

0:12:54.620,0:12:57.340
This is my oldest son.

0:12:57.340,0:13:00.860
I told him and he agreed.

0:13:00.860,0:13:04.720
My third son is a footballer.

0:13:04.720,0:13:08.160
I tried everything for him to come to England but no way.

0:13:08.160,0:13:09.720
I spent a lot of money but no way.

0:13:09.720,0:13:16.980
He is my third son.

0:13:16.980,0:13:21.620
He doesn't talk to me for no reason.

0:13:21.620,0:13:26.540
He doesn't even talk to his brothers.

0:13:26.540,0:13:32.440
It was from the mum because he was not like this.

0:13:32.440,0:13:45.500
This boy saw me after 22 years at The SCOAN and was smiling at me, peacefully.

0:13:45.500,0:13:46.960
I carried my grandchildren.

0:13:46.960,0:13:49.220
Look at one of them.

0:13:49.220,0:13:52.540
I carried the other one in his hand also.

0:13:52.540,0:13:54.980
This baby was looking at me, smiling.

0:13:54.980,0:14:03.920
She slept in my arms and I wept.

0:14:03.920,0:14:08.640
On Thursday we were here.

0:14:08.640,0:14:21.580
It is a miracle for me to be able to bring them to The SCOAN today for deliverance.

0:14:21.580,0:14:24.040
It is a miracle for me already.

0:14:24.040,0:14:29.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:29.100,0:14:31.320
You have listened to that?

0:14:31.320,0:14:33.360
That was last Sunday.

0:14:33.360,0:14:42.400
When the prophetic service was going on, amidst of the people there, our father was given a message,

0:14:42.400,0:14:45.900
exactly as you have heard.

0:14:45.900,0:14:48.260
I asked him to wait for me.

0:14:48.260,0:14:51.000
I wouldn't like to say much.

0:14:51.000,0:14:58.060
I know our father has some impression about our mommy sitting down.

0:14:58.060,0:15:02.160
Ogolobo (?)

0:15:02.160,0:15:07.060
Everywhere I went, they told me she was a witch.

0:15:07.060,0:15:10.800
Pastors and prophets called her names.

0:15:10.800,0:15:13.500
You mean that many prophets told you she was a witch?

0:15:13.500,0:15:16.460
Yes, but they couldn't do anything.

0:15:16.460,0:15:17.840
What is Ogolobo?

0:15:17.840,0:15:20.080
Ogolobo means "original witch".

0:15:20.080,0:15:27.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:27.860,0:15:29.580
OK.

0:15:29.580,0:15:32.600
How many years ago you saw her last?

0:15:32.600,0:15:34.220
34 years.

0:15:34.220,0:15:36.800
34 years before you saw her here on Thursday?

0:15:36.800,0:15:40.660
34 years before I met her here.

0:15:40.660,0:15:43.080
That was after the Sunday service...

0:15:43.080,0:15:44.280
Yes, exactly.

0:15:44.280,0:15:46.760
... the following Thursday you met her?

0:15:46.760,0:15:49.060
Yes, the next Thursday she came.

0:15:49.060,0:15:55.360
You know, we are in the presence of God and nothing in hidden.

0:15:55.360,0:16:00.080
Our brother, children are standing there and listening.

0:16:00.080,0:16:07.100
I want to thank your son, who is not taking sides, he is standing in neutral.

0:16:07.100,0:16:10.860
He believes that he is building his own family.

0:16:10.860,0:16:14.300
Look at the role our brother plays.

0:16:14.300,0:16:25.240
What a role, trying to make sure he is not disconnected from the father or mother.

0:16:25.240,0:16:31.460
If not our brother here, we would not be able to sit here and talk

0:16:31.460,0:16:34.360
because the whole thing would have gone worse.

0:16:34.360,0:16:38.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:38.500,0:16:49.200
If not the role he played, we would not be here today talking about reconciliation, deliverance, prophecy.

0:16:49.200,0:16:51.300
He made sure he played the role.

0:16:51.300,0:16:55.660
He made sure he invited his father, he even put a money on the account.

0:16:55.660,0:16:59.020
He made sure the father comes, and when the father came...

0:16:59.020,0:17:03.560
He didn't even say no - he said, "Synagogue, OK - let's go".

0:17:03.560,0:17:06.100
He tried to play two roles just like that.

0:17:06.100,0:17:09.500
The youth nowadays - we have a lesson to learn.

0:17:09.500,0:17:12.300
Because normally we take sides.

0:17:12.300,0:17:19.860
Anytime there is trouble between father and mother, instead of you to stand and take a different role...

0:17:19.860,0:17:29.460
I mean to stay clear from this matter and do not disconnect from your mother or father.

0:17:29.460,0:17:35.960
Our role in the matter of our father and mother actually matters.

0:17:35.960,0:17:47.920
If we were able to take a role our brother had taken, the situation would not have come to isolation.

0:17:47.920,0:17:51.940
Make sure to see what you can do by keeping praying for them

0:17:51.940,0:17:54.300
because they are also your father and your mum.

0:17:54.300,0:18:02.880
No matter what happened, no matter the name we call mommy or father - they are the ones giving birth to you.

0:18:02.880,0:18:07.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:07.200,0:18:13.520
The names prophet and pastor nowadays have become titles.

0:18:13.520,0:18:18.100
We shouldn't be carried away by the title or name anybody bears.

0:18:18.100,0:18:25.420
A man can be a prophet, pastor or bishop, and yet unbeliever.

0:18:25.420,0:18:27.100
So, we still need to ask God.

0:18:27.100,0:18:34.200
We shouldn't be carried away, "the prophet or pastor have said that momma is a witch"- no!

0:18:34.200,0:18:37.900
We still need to ask God.

0:18:37.900,0:18:41.180
In every situation God has something to say.

0:18:41.180,0:18:43.960
We need to ask God!

0:18:43.960,0:18:46.900
Who is momma by the way?

0:18:46.900,0:18:49.660
This is an issue now.

0:18:49.660,0:18:53.520
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:18:53.520,0:19:00.220
I don’t know where to start but I know I have a lot to say.

0:19:00.220,0:19:03.320
My name is Ifeanyi Kenneth Okpoko.

0:19:03.320,0:19:08.560
I am the second son of the family.

0:19:08.560,0:19:16.580
I happen to be the most doubting of all the Thomases.

0:19:16.580,0:19:20.160
In the first place, I rarely go to church.

0:19:20.160,0:19:24.220
I have never been a church goer, I don’t even pray.

0:19:24.220,0:19:28.760
I just live as every other free man.

0:19:28.760,0:19:34.240
I just believe in the laws of nature; you do evil, evil comes to you; you do good, good comes to you.

0:19:34.240,0:19:36.020
I have always been a naturalist.

0:19:36.020,0:19:43.980
When I met my wife in Kano, she was introduced to me by a family I was supplying goods to.

0:19:43.980,0:19:47.020
That was a long time ago, in the year 2000.

0:19:47.020,0:20:05.860
One of the things she used to lure me into marrying her, was that she said that she was a Christian.

0:20:05.860,0:20:11.480
When talking to her, she would quote the book of James, etc.

0:20:11.480,0:20:14.640
Any conversation would end with Christ.

0:20:14.640,0:20:22.900
I thought that as I am not a Christian - I was a Christian by birth but not a practising one.

0:20:22.900,0:20:27.480
I decided to marry this woman who was very close to God.

0:20:27.480,0:20:36.220
It failed because the woman I thought would lead me to God, became something else after I married her.

0:20:36.220,0:20:40.060
When we moved to Lagos, she started worshipping in another place.

0:20:40.060,0:20:44.960
She went there every Sunday morning.

0:20:44.960,0:20:52.120
She would go to church singing praises but come back a wild creature.

0:20:52.120,0:20:55.000
She didn’t care about me or the family.

0:20:55.000,0:20:56.880
She would not care about my meal.

0:20:56.880,0:21:02.360
It continued until I became diabetic in 2005.

0:21:02.360,0:21:06.060
I told her about my health status and she didn't care.

0:21:06.060,0:21:07.660
She said that I could go and marry someone

0:21:07.660,0:21:12.120
who would take care of my diabetes that she didn't bargain for that.

0:21:12.120,0:21:14.960
As she got on with her career, it became worse.

0:21:14.960,0:21:16.780
She was working with a bank then.

0:21:16.780,0:21:19.860
After she started working with UBA.

0:21:19.860,0:21:24.820
As her career progressed she became more wild.

0:21:24.820,0:21:29.800
If I talked she would shout at me and if I threatened her with separation,

0:21:29.800,0:21:34.940
she would say that her job was better without a husband so she was ready to leave.

0:21:34.940,0:21:41.240
These things would be happening and each time I spoke with my dad he said that he wanted to come back

0:21:41.240,0:21:44.860
and that it appeared as if he and myself shared the same destiny.

0:21:44.860,0:21:49.420
I said no, that he just hand to come back; to know what was really going on.

0:21:49.420,0:21:55.300
When we were growing up, my dad would be talking about my mum being a witch but

0:21:55.300,0:21:59.820
I didn’t want to dwell on that because I didn’t know how to identify a witch.

0:21:59.820,0:22:05.640
I tried as much as possible to play my role as a son, both to my mother and father.

0:22:05.640,0:22:11.200
If I go to England, my father complains that his work is not good;

0:22:11.200,0:22:13.640
he doesn’t know what happens to his money.

0:22:13.640,0:22:15.680
Each time I leave him, I give him some money.

0:22:15.680,0:22:18.720
When I come back to Nigeria, I call him to see how he is.

0:22:18.720,0:22:24.460
If he needs money, from the little I have, I send to him like 2-3000 pounds for his upkeep.

0:22:24.460,0:22:26.460
I do the same thing for my mum.

0:22:26.460,0:22:31.520
I try to remain very neutral as I know one day God will address the situation.

0:22:31.520,0:22:37.080
The first thing I did was to renovate my father's house in the village, which he was building before he left.

0:22:37.080,0:22:41.320
Then, I told my dad that I wanted my mum to come back to that house

0:22:41.320,0:22:43.200
so that someone would be there to take care of the house.

0:22:43.200,0:22:48.440
My dad said he didn't want to see that woman in his territory.

0:22:48.440,0:22:51.240
I didn't use force, I just tried to lure him by saying

0:22:51.240,0:22:57.960
that we should bring my mum to the house for the sake of keeping it clean.

0:22:57.960,0:23:01.000
So, because he listens to me, he agreed to let her come back.

0:23:01.000,0:23:03.520
That's how our mum started staying in our house.

0:23:03.520,0:23:07.920
Each time we came back, she would come to attend to us.

0:23:07.920,0:23:13.380
However, I was a person that didn't believe in miracles.

0:23:13.380,0:23:18.400
My dad told me that if he had money, he wanted to return to Nigeria

0:23:18.400,0:23:22.100
and the first place he would visit is The SCOAN.

0:23:22.100,0:23:27.580
I told him not to believe what he sees on television, that he shouldn't bother.

0:23:27.580,0:23:32.140
However, he insisted that when coming to Nigeria, he would go to The SCOAN.

0:23:32.140,0:23:35.860
I said, OK and asked whether he wanted money for a flight ticket.

0:23:35.860,0:23:40.260
He said that if he had the money, he would enter the next available flight.

0:23:40.260,0:23:43.760
I thought he was joking because I had done so many things to bring him back home

0:23:43.760,0:23:46.640
but each time I raised the topic, he would tell me one story or the other.

0:23:46.640,0:23:51.980
He would make an excuse about kidnapping or poor electricity.

0:23:51.980,0:23:55.400
I told him the electricity should not be a barrier as I had a generator in my house.

0:23:55.400,0:23:57.760
He asked about transportation, that he needed a car to move around.

0:23:57.760,0:24:00.480
I told him not to worry about that as I had cars in my house.

0:24:00.480,0:24:02.560
He kept giving one excuse or another.

0:24:02.560,0:24:08.560
One thing that made him want to come back was because he wanted to visit The SCOAN.

0:24:08.560,0:24:12.200
He said that he was coming back to go to The SCOAN and solve the problem.

0:24:12.200,0:24:15.860
I said that as he had said it; the problem is solved.

0:24:15.860,0:24:20.360
I didn't have the money he was asking for but I had a friend who normally gave him money in England.

0:24:20.360,0:24:22.860
I told him to pay 500 pounds into my dad's account

0:24:22.860,0:24:26.500
because my dad said he had found a ticked for about 500 pounds.

0:24:26.500,0:24:27.860
I told him that I would reimburse him.

0:24:27.860,0:24:32.000
The guy immediately gave him the money and my dad called me that he had received the money.

0:24:32.000,0:24:35.460
The next day, he called me and said the 500 pounds ticket would not work,

0:24:35.460,0:24:38.920
they said it was 625 pounds but I should not worry as he was going to make up

0:24:38.920,0:24:41.900
for the difference; he would get remaining 125 pounds.

0:24:41.900,0:24:47.080
I said to myself, "If daddy is talking like this, then there is a miracle on the way".

0:24:47.080,0:24:50.400
I thought it was a joke until he called me and said he was in Nigeria.

0:24:50.400,0:24:53.160
I didn't believe it.

0:24:53.160,0:24:55.860
I called my elder brother to come to my house so that we could drive

0:24:55.860,0:24:59.300
straight to the airport because I live very close to the airport.

0:24:59.300,0:25:02.520
When my brother came, I told him we were expecting daddy.

0:25:02.520,0:25:04.900
He said, "Yes, but until we see him…"

0:25:04.900,0:25:10.380
We didn't go to the airport until he was outside at arrivals, calling me on the phone.

0:25:10.380,0:25:12.220
We had to rush to go and pick him up.

0:25:12.220,0:25:14.820
Behold, it was our dad!

0:25:14.820,0:25:18.820
I took him home and told everyone that daddy was around.

0:25:18.820,0:25:23.740
The next day he said, "I am going to The SCOAN. Early in the morning, please take me to The SCOAN".

0:25:23.740,0:25:30.720
I told him that I didn't like waking up early in the morning, that I was not a church fan

0:25:30.720,0:25:33.560
and that any of those prophetic things did not work for me.

0:25:33.560,0:25:37.760
My dad said, "You don't want to follow me to The SCOAN and it is very close to your house".

0:25:37.760,0:25:42.240
I told him that I didn't want to go, that I would allow my driver to sleep overnight and take him to The SCOAN.

0:25:42.240,0:25:45.560
So, I asked my driver to sleep overnight and very early in the morning,

0:25:45.560,0:25:47.660
before I had woken up, they had already gone.

0:25:47.660,0:25:56.240
When my dad came back about 1:30 am, he said, "Do you know that the man of God spotted me?"

0:25:56.240,0:25:57.680
He said that he was the second person spotted be the man of God.

0:25:57.680,0:26:01.760
I said, "You? Out of all the congregation and all the people who are coming to The SCOAN,

0:26:01.760,0:26:02.760
the man spotted you?"

0:26:02.760,0:26:03.580
He said, "Yes".

0:26:03.580,0:26:06.400
I told him that I didn't believe him.

0:26:06.400,0:26:08.740
He said, "You didn't watch Emmanuel TV?"

0:26:08.740,0:26:09.940
I said, "I didn't".

0:26:09.940,0:26:14.000
He said, „This man spotted me and the first thing he asked me was, 'Where is your wife?'

0:26:14.000,0:26:16.960
So, this man went directly to the problem”.

0:26:16.960,0:26:18.440
I said, “What?”

0:26:18.440,0:26:24.000
He then said that the man o God said all the family members should come.

0:26:24.000,0:26:26.360
I asked him when the next appointment was.

0:26:26.360,0:26:29.940
He said that he didn’t know whether it was Thursday or Sunday.

0:26:29.940,0:26:32.100
In fact, he was so excited...

0:26:32.100,0:26:34.340
I said, “Let it be Thursday”.

0:26:34.340,0:26:39.460
I was supposed to travel for a job in the east but said that we should gather the whole family.

0:26:39.460,0:26:42.880
He said the first thing he knew was that my mum would not come.

0:26:42.880,0:26:45.020
I said, “Well, let us try that”.

0:26:45.020,0:26:51.700
I called my mother and told her that there was something going on in T.B. Joshua's church,

0:26:51.700,0:26:53.900
very close to where my younger brother lives.

0:26:53.900,0:26:55.680
My mum was staying with my younger brother.

0:26:55.680,0:27:00.640
The perfect thing about this miracle is that my mum who had always been in the village,

0:27:00.640,0:27:07.740
was in Lagos for some months because my younger brother's wife had a baby.

0:27:07.740,0:27:09.680
The whole thing was well arranged.

0:27:09.680,0:27:15.300
I know how I had been trying to get my mum to come and stay in Lagos but she would not want to stay.

0:27:15.300,0:27:18.300
My dad said, “This woman will not come. I bet you she will not come”.

0:27:18.300,0:27:21.600
I replied, “Daddy, don’t conclude. Let me invite her”.

0:27:21.600,0:27:27.140
I told my mother that her attention was needed in The SCOAN on Thursday.

0:27:27.140,0:27:28.840
My mum asked, “How early?”

0:27:28.840,0:27:31.280
I told her maybe by 5 am as people were many there.

0:27:31.280,0:27:32.740
My mum said, “No problem”.

0:27:32.740,0:27:36.060
I called my younger brother who she was staying with.

0:27:36.060,0:27:39.600
My younger brother said that he would bring her.

0:27:39.600,0:27:41.460
Nobody complained.

0:27:41.460,0:27:45.340
Very early, around 5 am, we were here and my mum was there.

0:27:45.340,0:27:53.660
Surprisingly, when we went to the canopy, my mum rushed towards my dad for the first time in 34 years

0:27:53.660,0:27:56.980
and said, “I want to greet you”.

Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:28:08.720,0:28:12.100
Yes, God has spoken.

0:28:12.100,0:28:14.120
Who is there to say "no" on "yes"?

0:28:14.120,0:28:15.340
[No one.]

0:28:15.340,0:28:23.840
OK. The question now is to ask God; whether trillion prophets, or all prophets of the world have spoken...

0:28:23.840,0:28:26.640
When God says "yes", no one...

0:28:26.640,0:28:30.720
What happened to our mum is a mere affliction.

0:28:30.720,0:28:35.120
Everyone also has this affliction.

0:28:35.120,0:28:45.380
When I say affliction, it doesn't mean you possess any power, it is rather a fruit of the flesh.

0:28:45.380,0:28:51.740
Mommy has that stubborn spirit.

0:28:51.740,0:28:53.160
It is not a witch.

0:28:53.160,0:28:58.460
This momma is not a witch.

0:28:58.460,0:29:01.640
Please baba, it is not a witch.

0:29:01.640,0:29:08.960
I want to stand here to say that the steps you have taken so far - no one can blame you for that

0:29:08.960,0:29:12.900
because we don't know who is prophet and who is not a prophet.

0:29:12.900,0:29:20.200
As a man who runs to ministers of God for a counselling, for a direction -

0:29:20.200,0:29:23.840
whatever you hear from them is final.

0:29:23.840,0:29:29.660
What you heard did not come from one, two, three... but almost a hundred people saying the same thing.

0:29:29.660,0:29:33.120
So, no one can blame you.

0:29:33.120,0:29:38.160
My mommy is my mum, she is very stubborn; that's all.

0:29:38.160,0:29:41.440
I don't know what to say.

0:29:41.440,0:29:48.120
This is the first time in my life that I am believing in a miracle, directly!

Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:29:52.900,0:29:54.620
I used to fall out with my mother.

0:29:54.620,0:30:00.520
Each time we would have a quarrel, I would tell her that she was as stubborn as my wife.

0:30:00.520,0:30:06.620
I told her that she was very stubborn and that, that was why I married a woman who was like her,

0:30:06.620,0:30:10.520
that each time I told her what my wife was doing she would not support me.

0:30:10.520,0:30:15.680
She would say, “I don’t want any of my sons to throw away their wives as your father threw me away".

0:30:15.680,0:30:19.120
I told her, “Mu daddy threw you away because you are stubborn”.

0:30:19.120,0:30:22.280
So, what the man of God said is absolutely true.

0:30:22.280,0:30:28.280
I have never said that my mum was a witch.

0:30:28.280,0:30:33.140
I always told my father, “Let God be the one to vindicate her”.

0:30:33.140,0:30:35.600
Each time my mother is talking...

0:30:35.600,0:30:41.360
One thing my mother would say was, “I am not afraid of going anywhere.

0:30:41.360,0:30:49.720
If I am a witch, Heaven will see but if I am not a witch, I will live to see the reconciliation of this family".

0:30:49.720,0:30:52.780
This is wonderful!

0:30:52.780,0:30:55.060
Thank you.

0:30:55.060,0:30:57.600
34 years.

0:30:57.600,0:31:00.820
Let us blame satan.

0:31:00.820,0:31:05.440
Don't blame your husband, your husband also cannot blame you for what happened.

0:31:05.440,0:31:07.560
Satan we should blame.

0:31:07.560,0:31:09.180
Satan - shame on you.

Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:31:14.920,0:31:19.060
I want to host you, people.
I want to join your family.

0:31:19.060,0:31:22.680
From now on, I want to join your family, I am a part of the family.

0:31:22.680,0:31:32.980
I will leave my 2 bedroom apartment and another 2 bedroom flat for the whole family.

0:31:32.980,0:31:36.980
When they leave here, they should set a table and let them meet together.

0:31:36.980,0:31:41.780
Baba, I will meet you one on one for counselling - let us talk.

0:31:41.780,0:31:43.740
We have to talk.

0:31:43.740,0:31:46.340
I want to congratulate you - you have wonderful children.

0:31:46.340,0:31:48.880
Even my brother - you say he doesn't greet you.

0:31:48.880,0:31:50.760
It is not his fault.

0:31:50.760,0:31:53.960
He doesn't know what to do.

0:31:53.960,0:31:55.580
He is confused.

0:31:55.580,0:31:59.260
He is just confused because the whole thing has affected the children.

0:31:59.260,0:32:01.120
The children don't know what to do.

0:32:01.120,0:32:10.920
This man is just enjoying the grace of standing, carrying out the little assignment of bringing the family together.

0:32:10.920,0:32:13.380
It is not his fault, he doesn't hate you.

0:32:13.380,0:32:15.880
You have wonderful children.

0:32:15.880,0:32:18.700
I want to thank you very much for your role.

0:32:18.700,0:32:19.640
Thank you.

0:32:19.640,0:32:22.160
So, momma, you will come back with a testimony.

0:32:22.160,0:32:24.480
Please, just sit down.

0:32:24.480,0:32:27.320
I am very happy for the whole thing.

0:32:27.320,0:32:37.160
I knew before I left England that I would have the last laugh and I am getting it.

0:32:37.160,0:32:41.180
Thank you.

0:32:41.180,0:32:44.240
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:32:44.240,0:32:46.820
I thank God for a day like this.

0:32:46.820,0:32:52.500
I thank God for raising a prophet like T.B. Joshua in our time.

0:32:52.500,0:32:58.020
Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:32:58.020,0:33:04.640
Some of my friends from South Africa, England, call me often to tell me,

0:33:04.640,0:33:13.100
“Look, you are living just behind the prophet and people are coming from all over the world to tap from

0:33:13.100,0:33:17.800
this anointing and you are so close and you tell me you are a diabetic for eight years”.

0:33:17.800,0:33:23.640
I feel pity for myself because if I had known Prophet T.B. Joshua before,

0:33:23.640,0:33:25.540
my marriage would not have been a wreck.

0:33:25.540,0:33:33.080
But today, I now know and I am standing in this auditorium to tell everybody anywhere in the world,

0:33:33.080,0:33:42.180
that whatever I can believe in is very real – any time, any day.

0:33:42.180,0:33:43.900
My diabetes has gone!

0:33:43.900,0:33:49.360
Anywhere I was going, I would go with drugs, which were always in my pocket.

0:33:49.360,0:33:55.000
Even when I was coming to see T.B. Joshua, I needed to eat and take my drugs.

0:33:55.000,0:33:58.180
I didn’t believe in anything; I believed in my drugs.

0:33:58.180,0:34:01.720
This is gliclazide, this one is galvus (?).

0:34:01.720,0:34:06.760
I had been on these drugs for eight years.

0:34:06.760,0:34:09.660
I had been languishing…

0:34:09.660,0:34:11.840
I don't know, I've been wasting...

0:34:11.840,0:34:13.440
Please, I want to see them.

0:34:13.440,0:34:17.620
Let the family go and have the time together.

0:34:17.620,0:34:23.140
Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:34:23.140,0:34:26.100
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven does not feel.

0:34:26.100,0:34:32.120
The reconciliation of this family proves that Jesus Christ is concerned about us, wants to be involved

0:34:32.120,0:34:36.980
in everything about us, and walk us through whatever live brings.

0:34:36.980,0:34:43.420
As Christians, we are commissioned solution providers, and have been given the ministry of reconciliation.

0:34:43.420,0:34:46.960
The joy on their faces are evident, as they leave the auditorium

0:34:46.960,0:34:50.820
to have their first family meal together in years.

0:34:50.820,0:34:57.800
Thank You, Jesus Christ for restoring this broken home.

The Okpoko Family Enjoying A Meal Together After Reconciliation

0:35:56.420,0:36:06.800
My name is Obiageri Okpoko, the daughter-in-law of Emmanuel Okpoko, which is our daddy.

0:36:06.800,0:36:10.260
My mother-in-law is Theresa Okpoko.

0:36:10.260,0:36:19.620
I thank T.B. Joshua for this day because it is a great day in this family of Okpoko.

0:36:19.620,0:36:29.600
We had been waiting for this day to happen in our lives to see the solution - the end of this problem.

0:36:29.600,0:36:34.160
If you had never seen or witnessed such, you would not know that this is a problem.

0:36:34.160,0:36:37.880
It is not until it happens to you that you will know that it is a big problem.

0:36:37.880,0:36:45.860
I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for bringing us together.

0:36:45.860,0:36:52.680
May the Lord who has put him in this position ensure he is never brought down.

0:36:52.680,0:36:59.160
For his generation and all the people who have worked in his ministry,

0:36:59.160,0:37:03.060
their story will never remain the same, in the name of Jesus.

0:37:03.060,0:37:06.580
In conclusion – Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23).

0:37:06.580,0:37:09.220
My name is Ebiseme Okpoko.

0:37:09.220,0:37:12.000
I am the wife of the third son.

0:37:12.000,0:37:20.240
I would say that I am the happiest person here because I remember when I was getting married to my husband,

0:37:20.240,0:37:24.720
my family thought that he never had any family members.

0:37:24.720,0:37:28.000
I am so happy because I believe, right now, they will be watching me,

0:37:28.000,0:37:31.700
sitting and dining with my husband’s family.

0:37:31.700,0:37:34.060
I am very happy.

0:37:34.060,0:37:36.180
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:37:36.180,0:37:38.620
It is a wonderful day!

0:37:38.620,0:37:47.040
I never believed that in this world, I would be able to toast with my ex-wife.

0:37:47.040,0:37:53.240
I never knew it could ever be like this but it has happened!

0:37:53.240,0:37:57.860
To be honest, it is a wonderful day for me.

0:37:57.860,0:38:04.260
Not only that, I have forgiven her for whatever had happened between us.

0:38:04.260,0:38:05.480
My heart is clear.

0:38:05.480,0:38:06.720
[Amen!]

0:38:06.720,0:38:10.380
Now, she is my wife!

0:38:42.540,0:38:49.780
After their glorious reconciliation in Christ Jesus, the Okpoko family spent quality time together

0:38:49.780,0:38:53.920
at the faith resort ground of The SCOAN

0:38:53.920,0:39:00.560
praying in unity as a family and worshipping God in the beauty of His holiness.

0:39:00.560,0:39:06.380
Truly, the Gospel of God's grace changes and challenges everything.

0:39:06.380,0:39:11.540
To His power nothing is impossible.

My name is Okechukwu Francis Okpoko.

0:39:49.880,0:39:55.620
I am the eldest son of Mr. Emmanuel Okpoko.

0:39:55.620,0:40:08.460
I want to thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:40:08.460,0:40:11.680
I want to thank God for a day like this.

0:40:11.680,0:40:18.840
I never believed in my lifetime that I would be a part of this.

0:40:18.840,0:40:29.440
Seeing my mother and father come back together after 34 years, to me, it is more than a miracle.

0:40:29.440,0:40:31.760
It is more than a miracle!

0:40:31.760,0:40:35.300
My junior brother has said a lot.

0:40:35.300,0:40:41.000
I just want to thank God for a day like this.

0:40:41.000,0:40:45.040
My name is Ikechukwu Okpoko.
I am the third son.

0:40:45.040,0:40:47.740
My brothers have said it all.

0:40:47.740,0:40:51.420
I don’t need to say anything much than to say, Emmanuel!

0:40:51.420,0:40:53.680
I give Him the glory!

0:40:53.680,0:40:57.100
I have seen many prophets but there is no prophet like him.

0:40:57.100,0:40:59.000

The Okpoko Family Fellowship Together At The Faith Resort Ground

0:41:17.140,0:41:23.860
With the pain of the past gone and forgotten, the family hug themselves and laugh together.

0:41:23.860,0:41:30.180
It is hard to imagine that this family had been separated for more than 34 years.

0:41:30.180,0:41:35.740
After the word of prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua the power of God stepped onto the scene

0:41:35.740,0:41:45.120
and broke the spirit of division and unforgivingness, that had held the family in bondage for so many decades.

0:41:45.120,0:41:55.100
Following this remarkable reconciliation, the family returned for a joyous testimony the following week.

0:41:55.100,0:41:59.240
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:41:59.240,0:42:05.060
Today is a great day for me and I never knew that a day like this would come.

0:42:05.060,0:42:07.900
You can see my wife here.

0:42:07.900,0:42:13.920
I never realised I could ever be together with her.

0:42:13.920,0:42:19.840
I never dreamt that it could be possible.

0:42:19.840,0:42:21.980
Her name is Theresa.

0:42:21.980,0:42:27.700
My name is Emmanuel Nwoye Okpoko from Anambra State.

0:42:27.700,0:42:41.460
Since this problem started, the hatred was so much that I didn't like to see any woman whose name was Theresa.

0:42:41.460,0:42:44.420
I didn’t even give them a lift in my car.

0:42:44.420,0:42:49.380
If I gave you a lift and your name was Theresa, I would ask you to get out.

0:42:49.380,0:42:58.560
You can imagine the weight of the whole thing before I left for England.

0:42:58.560,0:43:02.480
One step forward and three steps backward.

0:43:02.480,0:43:04.600
I was in England but had nothing to show for it.

0:43:04.600,0:43:07.560
Was I the only African man in England?

0:43:07.560,0:43:15.240
Anywhere we go they say... you know, sometimes they call names anyway...

0:43:15.240,0:43:18.460
I would make money but the money would disappear.

0:43:18.460,0:43:19.680
Sometimes...

0:43:19.680,0:43:27.860
I would make money, pay it to the bank but when I would go there the next week, the money would be gone.

0:43:27.860,0:43:33.000
I never knew that there was a way that things could happen negatively

0:43:33.000,0:43:35.080
such that you would be laboring in vain.

0:43:35.080,0:43:40.280
For everything, I blamed my wife.

0:43:40.280,0:43:44.080
Everything that would happen, I’d blame my wife that she might be the cause.

0:43:44.080,0:43:50.900
I was proved wrong last Sunday by the man of God that she was not a witch.

0:43:50.900,0:43:56.940
Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:43:56.940,0:44:04.840
Most surprisingly, today, when we were on the prayer line

0:44:04.840,0:44:14.740
and the wise men were touching us, I was eagerly looking at her.

0:44:14.740,0:44:19.520
The first set of wise men came and touched her; nothing happened.

0:44:19.520,0:44:22.880
Another set came, touched her but nothing happened.

0:44:22.880,0:44:27.240
Up to seven times, she was just calm.

0:44:27.240,0:44:29.520
Then I came out of my...

0:44:37.260,0:44:47.640
I got up from my seat and shook her hands because I was surprised.

0:44:47.640,0:44:50.440
Since that Sunday...

0:44:50.440,0:44:55.480
Today, I have actually accepted her back.

0:44:55.480,0:45:02.880
Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:45:02.880,0:45:08.960
For 34 years, we had no contact of any kind.

0:45:08.960,0:45:10.600
The hatred had built up.

0:45:10.600,0:45:13.740
Today, everything has been cleared.

0:45:13.740,0:45:21.720
There is no hatred between us or among our children.

0:45:21.720,0:45:25.720
Look at my children and grandchildren.

0:45:25.720,0:45:29.060
All of them came out from me and her.

0:45:29.060,0:45:32.020
She is the mother of all these children.

0:45:32.020,0:45:37.600
I thank God and the man of God for making it real.

0:45:37.600,0:45:40.820
I never believed that a day like this would come to pass.

0:45:40.820,0:45:46.700
Glory by to God for making it possible for me and my family.

0:45:46.700,0:45:53.880
Once again, shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!

0:45:53.880,0:45:55.560
Praise the Almighty God!

My name is Mrs. Theresa Nwamaka Okpoko

0:46:03.140,0:46:06.180
This is my second time of entering this church.

0:46:06.180,0:46:12.820
I thank Almighty God for T.B. Joshua who vindicated me from the allegations of being a witch,

0:46:12.820,0:46:21.680
which had spread to my home-town and among my children.

0:46:21.680,0:46:28.060
As God has made it, God knows better than me.

0:46:28.060,0:46:35.360
I also thank Almighty God for uniting my with my children and husband.

Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:46:49.920,0:46:58.380
I thank God for a day like this and that I am alive to witness this great reunion.

0:46:58.380,0:47:01.680
I never believed that I would live to see a day like this.

0:47:01.680,0:47:13.620
For 34 years, my parents had been separated and the hatred they had between them was unimaginable.

0:47:13.620,0:47:18.280
I think that it is only in The SCOAN that this kind of miracle could happen.

0:47:18.280,0:47:20.420
There is no other place in the world...

0:47:20.420,0:47:25.260
Okpoko Family Reconciliation

0:47:25.260,0:47:33.520
Through the prophecy that the man of God gave him, things started to turn around in our family.

0:47:33.520,0:47:40.140
In fact, for the first time ,we prayed and ate together in 34 years.

0:47:40.140,0:47:43.740
It is unbelievable!

0:47:43.740,0:47:45.480

0:47:48.600,0:47:51.220
I am the second son of the family.

0:47:51.220,0:47:55.480
If I was allowed to give testimony continuously,

0:47:55.480,0:48:01.140
I would give this testimony for a whole year; every Sunday for one year.

0:48:01.140,0:48:06.720
I remain the most amazed of all the members of the family.

0:48:06.720,0:48:16.420
Amazed in the sense that I never believed a day like this would come to pass.

0:48:16.420,0:48:25.860
When my dad was insisting on coming to Nigeria to The SCOAN, I thought it was one of his false promises

0:48:25.860,0:48:33.440
because many times I had tried to bring him home but he had always come up with one excuse or the other.

0:48:33.440,0:48:37.340
Surprisingly, this time around, he decided on his own that he was going to come,

0:48:37.340,0:48:42.460
that all he wanted me to do was to send the ticket money, if I could afford it.

0:48:42.460,0:48:45.520
I said, “Why not?” And I did.

0:48:45.520,0:48:49.660
He came into the country on a Thursday.

0:48:49.660,0:48:52.920
He started telling me on Saturday evening that I should take him to The SCOAN.

0:48:52.920,0:48:57.060
I told him that I didn’t like anything that would disrupt my sleep.

0:48:57.060,0:49:04.000
He was talking about waking up at 5am to go to The SCOAN and I have never done that for a very long time.

0:49:04.000,0:49:11.820
I could only wake up that early if somebody asked me to collect money for a contract -

0:49:11.820,0:49:19.140
that is the truth – not to go to a prophet whom I thought was full of lies and deceit

0:49:19.140,0:49:23.360
because that was how I saw prophets all over the country.

0:49:23.360,0:49:27.380
I am sorry to say that but that was the reality.

0:49:27.380,0:49:31.880
Honestly, it is only in a church like this, as my brother said

0:49:31.880,0:49:38.600
because the reunion and prophecy have not only reconciled my family;

0:49:38.600,0:49:43.000
it has reconciled my and God because I rarely went to church.

0:49:43.000,0:49:51.780
In a nutshell, the disunity had taken a toll on the family.

0:49:51.780,0:50:03.100
It disrupted our educational careers because at the time after my mother left the family,

0:50:03.100,0:50:06.740
things started working anti-clockwise for my dad.

0:50:06.740,0:50:11.320
He tried to marry another wife; the woman came in.

0:50:11.320,0:50:14.960
She did her best; she was a wonderful woman as a matter of fact.

0:50:14.960,0:50:22.900
She brought us all up the way our dad wanted it but things were not working; they worked anti-clockwise.

0:50:22.900,0:50:26.280
My dad had always told us that our mother was a witch

0:50:26.280,0:50:30.720
and that she had been against his progress since she left.

0:50:30.720,0:50:37.020
When I was growing up, I started playing a very neutral role on the issue,

0:50:37.020,0:50:43.140
believing that I did not have any instrument for scanning witches.

0:50:43.140,0:50:48.700
I knew that if my dad was correct, one day, God would reveal it to him and

0:50:48.700,0:50:52.940
if he was not, one day, God would reveal it to him.

0:50:52.940,0:50:58.720
I have always tried to play the role of a son to both parents because that was what mattered.

0:50:58.720,0:51:01.440
I had been an unbiased umpire on the matter.

0:51:01.440,0:51:07.460
If I saw my dad in England, I tried to make him comfortable as much as I could and

0:51:07.460,0:51:12.300
back here in Nigeria, I tried to give my mother all the comfort I could afford,

0:51:12.300,0:51:15.740
believing that one day, a day like this would actually come.

0:51:15.740,0:51:20.740
I didn’t know it would come so soon.

0:51:20.740,0:51:24.660
If I call Prophet T.B. Joshua a prophet, it is an understatement.

0:51:24.660,0:51:28.340
I prefer to see him as God incarnate.

0:51:33.280,0:51:36.660
We know you have a lot to say.

0:51:36.660,0:51:44.780
But we want it make this point clear that the man of God said, "He is not the Healer, he is not a Deliverer,

0:51:44.780,0:51:50.180
he is not a Saviour. He only knows the Saviour, he only knows the Healer, he only know the Deliverer,

0:51:50.180,0:51:55.700
who is our Lord and Saviour. He is not Jesus. He is a servant of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."

0:51:55.700,0:52:01.960
We thank God for using the man of God in this mighty way, to do these mighty things in the lives of the people.

My name is Chinwendu Okpoko.

0:52:06.780,0:52:09.520
I happen to be the last child of my mother.

0:52:09.520,0:52:15.280
My mother happens to be the second wife of my dad.

0:52:15.280,0:52:20.120
Growing up without a dad was really challenging for me.

0:52:20.120,0:52:26.820
I remember, way back in primary school if I was asked where my dad was, I really had nothing to say.

0:52:26.820,0:52:34.400
It was really challenging for me but I want to bless the name of God for making it possible for me to see

0:52:34.400,0:52:41.100
my dad for the first time in my life after how many years.

0:52:41.100,0:52:44.020
Could you tell us, how old are you now?

0:52:44.020,0:52:44.980
I am 23 years old.

0:52:44.980,0:52:48.420
So, for 23 years - you are seeing your father for the first time?

0:52:48.420,0:52:49.960
Yes.

0:52:49.960,0:52:52.080
Here, at The SCOAN?

0:52:52.080,0:52:53.160
Yes.

0:52:53.160,0:52:56.440
Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!

I am the third son.

0:53:04.860,0:53:09.360
I thank God for today and I know that whatever God has done is permanent.

0:53:09.360,0:53:10.880
Nobody can change it.

0:53:10.880,0:53:17.440
I believe one thing about The SCOAN - the prophecies here are very accurate and unmistakable.

0:53:17.440,0:53:23.160
I don’t really understand, I am not the man of God but the way he does his things, only God knows.

0:53:23.160,0:53:26.460
Everything he says is accurate; and don’t doubt it.

0:53:26.460,0:53:28.380
Just don’t doubt it.

0:53:42.920,0:53:44.900
in Spirit and in Truth.

0:53:44.900,0:53:51.080
