0:00:00.000,0:00:03.340
Man of God, help me.

0:00:03.340,0:00:07.820
I’m afflicted by a stiff neck due to cervical spondylosis

0:00:07.820,0:00:15.180
and a knee problem due to osteoarthritis with torn cartilages.

0:00:15.180,0:00:16.840
My name is Professor Ddembe Williams.

0:00:16.840,0:00:20.300
I’m a professor of complex systems and mathematics.

0:00:20.300,0:00:23.400
I cannot teach anymore because I cannot stand.

0:00:23.400,0:00:27.960
I can’t do research because I cannot sit for long.

0:00:27.960,0:00:29.520
Please, help me.

0:00:29.520,0:00:39.060
I have been everywhere, in every hospital; I had the best physicians and consultants but to no avail.

0:00:39.060,0:00:42.400
I knew that my last bus stop would be this place.

0:00:42.400,0:00:46.560
After your healing and deliverance, you should be ready to render your services

0:00:46.560,0:00:49.640
for some months, in Africa here.

0:00:49.640,0:00:50.300
Yes.

0:00:50.300,0:00:51.160
Thank you, sir.

0:00:51.160,0:00:53.060
Your wife...

0:00:53.060,0:00:54.560
because you have challenges.

0:00:54.560,0:00:55.600
Yes.

0:00:55.600,0:00:57.520
It's God that saved you.

0:00:57.520,0:00:59.140
So, after the healing, we’ll talk about that.

0:00:59.140,0:00:59.840
Thank you, Man of God.

0:00:59.840,0:01:03.040
There's a boy.

0:01:03.040,0:01:03.620
Yes.

0:01:03.620,0:01:05.040
Where’s this boy?

0:01:05.040,0:01:06.520
Back in United Kingdom.

0:01:06.520,0:01:08.220
But he’s not with you.

0:01:08.220,0:01:09.400
No, he’s not with me.

0:01:09.400,0:01:11.260
That is why I’m asking you.

0:01:11.260,0:01:14.560
Because these are the issues we are going to work on.

0:01:14.560,0:01:15.060
Amen.

0:01:15.060,0:01:17.340
But this is not the time to talk about that now.

0:01:17.340,0:01:56.280
Healing In Jesus’ Name

0:01:56.280,0:01:59.660
Thank You, Jesus.

Healing In Jesus’ Name

0:02:05.240,0:02:09.700
OK, can you remove all this?

0:02:09.700,0:02:35.040
Healing In Jesus’ Name

0:02:35.040,0:02:36.340
Stand up.

0:02:36.340,0:02:38.880
Turn your neck.

0:02:38.880,0:02:45.760
Thank You, Jesus, I'm healed!

0:02:45.760,0:02:47.880
I can run!

TESTIMONY TIME

0:03:10.640,0:03:12.660
He is a picture of good health, to the glory of God.

0:03:12.660,0:03:19.360
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:03:19.360,0:03:24.680
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:03:24.680,0:03:26.700
Good morning, Church.

0:03:26.700,0:03:30.140
My name is Professor Ddembe Williams.

0:03:30.140,0:03:33.500
I am a professor of complex systems & data analytics.

0:03:33.500,0:03:37.280
I'm from the United Kingdom.

0:03:37.280,0:03:46.860
What brought me to The SCOAN is affliction in my neck.

0:03:46.860,0:03:54.620
I had stiff neck and that caused severe pain; I could not turn or bend.

0:03:54.620,0:03:57.680
It also caused paralysis in my heart.

0:03:57.680,0:04:06.860
I also had osteoarthritis in my knees; later it emerged that I had torn cartilages in my knees.

0:04:06.860,0:04:16.180
Basically, walking, standing and sitting was difficult; I lived in pain.

0:04:16.180,0:04:23.600
It was some time back when my maid and my driver said,

0:04:23.600,0:04:29.440
"You know, we've seen people being healed at Emmanuel TV".

0:04:29.440,0:04:31.360
I said, "Which one is that?"

0:04:31.360,0:04:34.960
That was 6 months ago.

0:04:34.960,0:04:41.300
I started watching, got inspiration, built up my faith and kept on praying.

0:04:41.300,0:04:47.000
Even if I slept in the lounge, I would switch on my Emmanuel TV,

0:04:47.000,0:04:55.220
to have it on in the background while I was sleeping.

0:04:55.220,0:05:04.140
I could not sit for long to write my papers.

0:05:04.140,0:05:11.020
By the time I finished my PhD I had already about 20 papers, but I could not write this time,

0:05:11.020,0:05:17.300
I could not go to class to teach my PhD or Masters class, because I couldn't stand for long.

0:05:17.300,0:05:21.720
An hour was utmost and I would still be in severe pain.

0:05:21.720,0:05:29.200
That affected me, my career because I wasn't contributing to my job,

0:05:29.200,0:05:35.040
and my institution started getting worried, looking for an alternative to replace me,

0:05:35.040,0:05:37.040
put me on leave and so forth.

0:05:37.040,0:05:43.140
That affected certainly my performance, but also my family.

0:05:43.140,0:05:50.200
My wife had all the time to miss her daily routine, her job to take me to the hospital.

0:05:50.200,0:05:57.420
For example: Every winter I had to go to the hospital and she had to push me in a wheelchair.

0:05:57.420,0:05:59.780
When I was travelling, I was seated in the wheelchair.

0:05:59.780,0:06:08.720
It became very cumbersome for me to do any job, or any useful contribution to society and my own family.

0:06:08.720,0:06:10.820
You said you went to various hospitals.

0:06:10.820,0:06:15.900
Medically, what did the doctors try to do to help you with this condition?

0:06:15.900,0:06:21.120
Medically, I went to many hospitals as you said, so many consultants...

0:06:21.120,0:06:24.940
As you know in the UK to get a consultant takes quite a long time,

0:06:24.940,0:06:36.340
but when I saw them, they could not really specify medications for me to be healed.

0:06:36.340,0:06:38.220
They gave me painkillers.

0:06:38.220,0:06:43.100
In a day I would take about 8 different tablets.

0:06:43.100,0:06:48.260
I was a kind of a walking pharmacy and it became really problematic,

0:06:48.260,0:06:54.860
because my local GP (general practitioner) said, "It might be that you will never get a cure for that,

0:06:54.860,0:06:58.200
you will live with these medications all your life".

0:06:58.200,0:07:00.220
So, it became very difficult.

0:07:00.220,0:07:04.820
It is the Holy Spirit who led me to The SCOAN.

0:07:04.820,0:07:07.700
I could not directly get my visa in the UK,

0:07:07.700,0:07:12.840
so I had to go to Nairobi where I managed to get a visa and then I came here.

0:07:12.840,0:07:20.300
When I came here, I was welcomed and put in the prayer line.

0:07:20.300,0:07:26.500
When the man of God came near me, while he was preaching,

0:07:26.500,0:07:29.080
it seemed as if he was preaching to me all the time.

0:07:29.080,0:07:33.280
I kind of kept on getting uplifting...

0:07:33.280,0:07:42.380
By the time he reached me, I was already done, because I could only hear his voice,

0:07:42.380,0:07:45.300
the congregation kind of disappeared.

0:07:45.300,0:07:49.660
I could only hear his voice and I was responding to his voice all the time.

0:07:49.660,0:08:00.400
When the man of God approached me and touched my left arm to the shoulder,

0:08:00.400,0:08:02.900
there was a hammer all the time.

0:08:02.900,0:08:11.060
I really felt a big punch of a hammer hitting me wherever he touched me.

0:08:11.060,0:08:13.020
It wasn't easy.

0:08:13.020,0:08:20.380
I could see his hand moving lightly like this, but it was translated to the body as a big hammer.

0:08:20.380,0:08:28.340
That kept on building up, until he said, "Stand up", and I just found myself standing up.

0:08:28.340,0:08:31.980
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:31.980,0:08:37.580
And since that day, sir, what are the changes in your life, health, everything about you?

0:08:37.580,0:08:40.960
Phenomenal - that's what.

0:08:40.960,0:08:45.240
Right from that day, I started walking and I haven't stopped.

0:08:45.240,0:08:49.220
I think people whom I've been with; going to the prayer mountain -

0:08:49.220,0:08:55.720
they have seen - I've been all the time trying, and now I can use my legs properly,

0:08:55.720,0:09:03.620
I can twist my neck - no problem at all; the arm is doing very well.

0:09:03.620,0:09:16.880
For the first time in 5 years, I went to the prayer mountain, knelt and prayed to my God.

0:09:16.880,0:09:26.540
So, I would like to really recommend to the viewers all over the world and in the congregation

0:09:26.540,0:09:31.820
that it is only Jesus and faith that can work.

0:09:31.820,0:09:41.760
Also to my academics: I know there are diverging views between scientific endeavour and the biblical Word.

0:09:41.760,0:09:44.600
I think those views are converging now.

0:09:44.600,0:09:52.560
I'm an example where convergence of scientific and God's views are coming together.

0:09:52.560,0:09:58.040
When you have a miracle like this, we scientists say, "This is unexplained",

0:09:58.040,0:10:09.800
but I want to tell the whole world that that unexplained is Jesus plus faith.

0:10:09.800,0:10:12.060
And that's what really healed me.

0:10:12.060,0:10:18.560
The Holy Spirit helped me to build my faith and with the prayers Jesus really located me,

0:10:18.560,0:10:23.740
and gave me this healing through the grace of the man of God

0:10:23.740,0:10:28.360
whom Jesus used as His channel to heal people like myself.

0:10:28.360,0:10:31.860
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:10:31.860,0:10:38.120
Sir, can you just now demonstrate what you can now do that you couldn't do before, to the glory of God.

0:10:38.120,0:10:47.560
Well, I can walk smartly in front of my students and give a lecture.

0:10:47.560,0:10:53.120
I can do many things; maybe I'm going to start playing football.

0:10:53.120,0:11:01.260
And of course, I can shake my neck and twist my hands, which I was not able to do earlier.

0:11:01.260,0:11:02.820
It is amazing.

0:11:02.820,0:11:09.440
I can testify that since last week Saturday, I have not taken a single tablet;

0:11:09.440,0:11:17.060
whethers painkiller, whether vitamins - nothing at all.

0:11:17.060,0:11:20.040
Jesus is my medication.

0:11:20.040,0:11:24.520
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:11:24.520,0:11:26.360
Just a final question, sir:

0:11:26.360,0:11:31.640
During your encounter with the man of God, he actually gave you a Word of prophecy concerning your son.

0:11:31.640,0:11:35.480
Can you just confirm how that Word of prophecy is also true for your life?

0:11:35.480,0:11:41.620
Actually, the man of God gave me two prophecies; one was about my son.

0:11:41.620,0:11:42.800
Yes, we have a child...

0:11:42.800,0:11:51.060
All my kids, I would say are brilliant as academics, they pursue their academic endeavours excellently,

0:11:51.060,0:11:54.280
but we have one who really can't progress.

0:11:54.280,0:12:00.540
We have tried to support him, taking him to psychologists, sociologists, psychiatrists,

0:12:00.540,0:12:02.180
but of no avail.

0:12:02.180,0:12:05.920
With the prophecy, I'm sure that has now come to an end;

0:12:05.920,0:12:10.080
he will be able to progress forward like any other child.

0:12:10.080,0:12:15.660
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:12:15.660,0:12:19.480
And he also prophesied about my wife.

0:12:19.480,0:12:22.200
We had challenges and I'm glad that...

0:12:22.200,0:12:28.360
Today, when I woke up in the morning, my wife was the first one to wish me the best for today -

0:12:28.360,0:12:32.060
so, that's already a breakthrough.

0:12:32.060,0:12:32.560
