T.B. Joshua @ 54 - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

0:00:15.340,0:00:19.300
I have decided to follow Jesus. I mean it, with all my heart:

0:00:19.300,0:00:22.580
If I did not mean it, today you would have been given history,

0:00:22.580,0:00:24.540
'There was a church called Synagogue'.

0:00:24.540,0:00:32.840
I took care of the depth of my relationship with Jesus.

0:00:32.840,0:00:40.580
Jesus took care of the breadth of my success.

0:00:40.580,0:00:45.320
Jesus would do the same for you.

0:00:45.320,0:00:47.140
Thank you.
