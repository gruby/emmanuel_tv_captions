0:00:00.060,0:00:06.280
Good Morning!

0:00:06.280,0:00:18.340
Let me see your Bible.

0:00:18.340,0:00:24.260
This one is as old as my age.

0:00:24.260,0:00:36.000
There are many latest, new versions and all that but this one is very new.

0:00:36.000,0:00:37.400
Hallelujah.

0:00:37.400,0:00:40.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:40.980,0:00:59.120
We all want to know more of our wonderful, unseen Guest.

0:00:59.120,0:01:00.760
Everyone wants to know.

0:01:00.760,0:01:05.680
You know you are walking but you know Someone is with you.

0:01:05.680,0:01:10.120
You know you are talking but Someone is there talking for you.

0:01:10.120,0:01:16.380
You know as you are sitting, Someone is sitting behind you, before you.

0:01:16.380,0:01:28.880
You just want to know more of your wonderful, unseen Guest.

0:01:28.880,0:01:31.060
Everyone wants to know.

0:01:31.060,0:01:33.700
If I'm alone here, I cannot stand here

0:01:33.700,0:01:38.200
because if I tell you what many hearts are saying, "Who is this man?

0:01:38.200,0:01:41.220
What does he want to do? Is that the one they are talking about?"

0:01:41.220,0:01:43.580
Let's see what he will do".

0:01:43.580,0:01:45.480
What do you want to see?

0:01:45.480,0:01:48.020
A lot of things are going on in your heart.

0:01:48.020,0:01:51.080
Many say, "Oh, what is going to happen? Well, let's see".

0:01:51.080,0:01:57.140
"I've been watching this man on Emmanuel TV and what does he want to say?"

0:01:57.140,0:02:07.060
If I were alone I would not be able to stand here today but Someone is with me.

0:02:07.060,0:02:15.680
Everyone of us wants to know more of our wonderful, unseen Guest.

0:02:15.680,0:02:19.920
If I'm talking to you?

0:02:19.920,0:02:28.120
If you sleep, you know Someone is sleeping with you; that is why you can see today.

0:02:28.120,0:02:35.040
You sleep, you wake up. If not Someone with you, you would not be able to wake up.

0:02:35.040,0:02:52.400
Tell you neighbour, "We all want to know more of our wonderful, unseen Guest".

0:02:52.400,0:03:05.980
That will take me to the title, 'Our Supernatural Guest'.

0:03:05.980,0:03:14.520
Let's quickly take a look at the book of John 14

0:03:14.520,0:03:19.540
and then we can take our reading from verse 15 there.

0:03:19.540,0:03:23.280
Jesus promised the Holy Spirit.

0:03:23.280,0:03:27.200
He promised the Holy Spirit.

0:03:27.200,0:03:37.600
He has promised He will never fail
I will follow Him

0:03:37.600,0:03:41.700
That is why you are following Him.

0:03:41.700,0:04:10.080
He has promised He will never fail
His faithfulness is forevermore

0:04:10.080,0:04:12.340
Think about that.

0:04:12.340,0:04:19.980
He has promised His faithfulness will never what?

0:04:19.980,0:04:21.040
- Never fail.

0:04:21.040,0:04:35.160
Here you are today, eating, sleeping, walking, looking freely because of His promise.

0:04:35.160,0:04:37.920
Let's take our reading from verse 15:

0:04:37.920,0:04:42.140
"If you love me, keep my commands.

0:04:42.140,0:04:47.060
And I will ask the Father..."

0:04:47.060,0:04:50.040
"I will ask the Father" - listen to that.

0:04:50.040,0:04:58.320
"...and He will give you another advocate" - helper.

0:04:58.320,0:05:05.240
In some of your Bibles, it says, comforter.

0:05:05.240,0:05:12.680
"He will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever."

0:05:12.680,0:05:16.360
Not now alone - forever.

0:05:16.360,0:05:18.340
Take your time to read.

0:05:18.340,0:05:25.220
We will have a lot of texts in the book of Acts of Apostles.

0:05:25.220,0:05:29.980
Let me just give you a few you can take note of.

0:05:29.980,0:05:34.640
After the service today, take your time to read over this text.

0:05:34.640,0:05:41.960
This will also lead us to the books of Acts 4:23,

0:05:41.960,0:05:51.960
Acts 6:3,

0:05:51.960,0:05:58.740
Acts 13:52 - that will also be one of our proof readings,

0:05:58.740,0:06:03.820
Acts 4:31.

0:06:03.820,0:06:09.840
The one about you in person, in particular is Ephesians 5:18.

0:06:09.840,0:06:14.260
That will also lead us to that.

0:06:14.260,0:06:21.240
Acts 16:6-7.

0:06:21.240,0:06:26.600
Our Supernatural Guest

0:06:26.600,0:06:31.200
Unseen Guest

0:06:31.200,0:06:33.960
The yearning, we are yearning...

0:06:33.960,0:06:40.500
If I were alone, I would not be able to do all this. Someone is with me.

0:06:40.500,0:06:48.400
If I were alone, I would not be able to escape this tragedy. Someone is with me.

0:06:48.400,0:06:54.680
Tell your neighbour, "Someone is with me in the person of the Holy Ghost".

0:06:54.680,0:06:56.680
I can't hear you.

0:06:56.680,0:07:01.080
[Someone is with me in the person of the Holy Ghost.]

0:07:01.080,0:07:07.020
King of kings, Lord of lords I worship

0:07:07.020,0:07:20.800
In that text John 14:15-16, it says, "If you love me, keep my commands".

0:07:20.800,0:07:24.660
What does that mean to you?

0:07:24.660,0:07:34.540
He does nothing without His Word. He speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:07:34.540,0:07:38.160
I will take it again. It says, "If you love me, keep my commands".

0:07:38.160,0:07:40.600
You say you love me, you are a child of God.

0:07:40.600,0:07:45.880
Keep my commands because I speak to you through my Word, by my Spirit.

0:07:45.880,0:07:54.660
In verse 16, it says, "I will ask the Father and He will give you another advocate to help you...".

0:07:54.660,0:08:11.100
This means, the Holy Spirit is another Comforter, another Helper.

0:08:11.100,0:08:20.140
Jesus Christ was the first Helper, first Comforter.

0:08:20.140,0:08:28.080
The Holy Spirit is another Helper - I mean Comforter.

0:08:28.080,0:08:50.620
In the absence of Jesus, the Holy Spirit was to be sent -

0:08:50.620,0:08:57.300
to take the place of Jesus Christ.

0:08:57.300,0:09:18.600
Worthy You are worthy
King of kings Lord of lords You are worthy

0:09:18.600,0:09:37.700
Worthy You are worthy
King of kings Lord of lords I worship You

0:09:37.700,0:09:55.660
He was, in a sense, to take the place of Jesus - the Holy Spirit.

0:09:55.660,0:10:03.000
The Holy Spirit is to be with us forever.

0:10:03.000,0:10:19.140
Forever oh Lord Your Word is settled
In Heaven it is settled

0:10:19.140,0:10:23.000
You mean, His Word is settled in your heart?

0:10:23.000,0:10:27.040
Heaven here in my heart?

0:10:27.040,0:10:46.740
Forever oh Lord Your Word is settled
In Heaven it is settled

0:10:46.740,0:11:01.660
The Holy Spirit is to be with us forever - through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:11:01.660,0:11:09.160
This is why the first text in verse 15 says, "If you love me, keep my commands".

0:11:09.160,0:11:25.120
His Word reflects His character.

0:11:25.120,0:11:43.220
I love the Man of Galilee
For He has done so very much for me

0:11:43.220,0:11:52.740
He has forgiven me all my sins
And sent the Holy Ghost to me

0:11:52.740,0:12:02.700
I love the Man of Galilee

0:12:02.700,0:12:06.280
If you love Him, say, "I love the Man of Galilee".

0:12:06.280,0:12:10.120
If you love Him, keep His Word.

0:12:10.120,0:12:18.600
He speaks to us through His Word by His Spirit because His Word reflects His character.

0:12:18.600,0:12:33.900
This is why the Bible says the Holy Spirit is not known or receved by everyone

0:12:33.900,0:12:42.920
but only those who keep His Word, only those who prepare for Him.

0:12:42.920,0:12:47.920
This is why many of you say, "What is Holy Spirit?" You don't know what Holy Spirit is.

0:12:47.920,0:12:54.780
You cannot receive the Holy Spirit without keeping His Word, abiding by His Word.

0:12:54.780,0:13:04.880
He said, "If you love Me, keep My Word".

0:13:04.880,0:13:21.280
The Apostles knew Jesus because they knew the Holy Ghost.

0:13:21.280,0:13:26.280
You know Jesus; you know the Holy Ghost.

0:13:26.280,0:13:37.940
To know Jesus is to know His Word; to love Him, keep His Word.

0:13:37.940,0:13:55.420
Jesus was not only the embodiment of the Heavenly Father but also of the Heavenly Spirit.

0:13:55.420,0:14:21.940
Note: First, He is a person. Second, He is divine.

0:14:21.940,0:14:36.720
A person has the ability to walk; the Holy Spirit walks as He wills.

0:14:36.720,0:14:45.060
In Acts 16:6-7, it says a person has the ability to decide.

0:14:45.060,0:14:47.680
"Okay."

0:14:47.680,0:14:49.240
"This one."

0:14:49.240,0:14:50.720
"Which?"

0:14:50.720,0:14:54.380
You have the ability to decide -

0:14:54.380,0:15:02.140
exercising the will through the mind; that is a person for you

0:15:02.140,0:15:06.940
but the Holy Spirit has the power of choice.

0:15:06.940,0:15:09.820
Okay, you have decided it but this is the right (one).

0:15:09.820,0:15:11.780
Absolutely!

0:15:11.780,0:15:14.820
Final - that is the Holy Spirit.

0:15:14.820,0:15:20.160
That is why people like me can be here today.

0:15:20.160,0:15:24.360
Each time you are trying to give me a wrong direction,

0:15:24.360,0:15:28.220
the Father in Heaven will say, "No, don't follow that direction; this is the direction".

0:15:28.220,0:15:33.620
Each time you are trying to give me a rumour, "Man of God, this is what has happened!",

0:15:33.620,0:15:36.780
I'm a good listener; I will listen to you.

0:15:36.780,0:15:42.880
By the time I have listened to you, you have said it...

0:15:42.880,0:15:55.700
Absolutely, the Holy Spirit is there to say, "No, what they are saying, it is not like that. This is the way".

0:15:55.700,0:16:04.980
He is Lord
He is Lord Amen

0:16:04.980,0:16:06.040
That is all!

0:16:06.040,0:16:15.380
He has risen from the dead
He is Lord

0:16:15.380,0:16:27.000
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess

0:16:27.000,0:16:34.500
That Jesus Christ is Lord

0:16:34.500,0:16:42.240
That is, that Jesus Christ is final.

0:16:42.240,0:16:54.180
A person has the ability to teach; He is the Ultimate Teacher!

0:16:54.180,0:17:04.360
In that book of John 14:26, the Holy Spirit teaches as He wills.

0:17:04.360,0:17:17.840
You can go out to witness, to testify, but He testifies, He witnesses.

0:17:17.840,0:17:22.720
Who are you?
That is the question, as a Christian.

0:17:22.720,0:17:34.480
The Bible says in that book of Ephesians 5:18, Who are you as a Christian?

0:17:34.480,0:17:42.520
"Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery.

0:17:42.520,0:17:46.500
Instead, be filled with the Spirit."

0:17:46.500,0:17:52.220
This means, all Christians should be filled with the Spirit.

0:17:52.220,0:18:01.900
What is the difference between being baptised in the Spirit and being filled with the Spirit?

0:18:01.900,0:18:05.420
That is the question you need to ask yourself.

0:18:05.420,0:18:20.540
If you take it to the book of Acts 13:52, Acts 4:31 and Acts 6:3.

0:18:20.540,0:18:28.180
Okay, let's take a look at Acts 4:31.

0:18:28.180,0:18:52.060
When they had prayed, the place was shaken and they were all filled with the Spirit.

0:18:52.060,0:19:02.060
In that Acts 13:52, it says, "And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."

0:19:02.060,0:19:04.260
Back to 31.

0:19:04.260,0:19:15.660
It says, when they had prayed, the place was shaken and they were all filled with the Spirit

0:19:15.660,0:19:22.720
and spoke the Word of God boldly - with boldness.

0:19:22.720,0:19:32.820
Take note - without evidence of miraculous power.

0:19:32.820,0:19:40.600
That is a Christian - without evidence of miraculous power.

0:19:40.600,0:19:46.040
This means, we could now say,

0:19:46.040,0:19:50.620
all that are baptised in the Holy Spirit will be filled with the Holy Spirit

0:19:50.620,0:19:57.040
but all that are filled with the Holy Spirit may not be baptised in the Holy Spirit.

0:19:57.040,0:19:58.440
Take note of that.

0:19:58.440,0:20:03.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:03.520,0:20:11.120
When one is baptised in the Holy Spirit, he is also filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:20:11.120,0:20:16.640
But one may be filled with the Holy Spirit and not be baptised in the Holy Spirit

0:20:16.640,0:20:32.620
because the baptism of the Holy Spirit will not allow your spirit to be free.

0:20:32.620,0:20:40.320
He is in total control of your spirit, has dominion of your spirit.

0:20:40.320,0:20:50.600
Man's spirit would not be free, not allowed to do his will.

0:20:50.600,0:21:01.340
But to be filled by the Spirit - there is an option; it is an optional matter.

0:21:01.340,0:21:10.660
To be filled by the Spirit, as a Christian, is an optional matter.

0:21:10.660,0:21:27.080
But to be baptised in the Spirit is total submission.

0:21:27.080,0:21:33.280
A suggestion must be given to you from the Spirit.

0:21:33.280,0:21:42.780
In every step, in every moment, a suggestion must come from the Spirit -

0:21:42.780,0:21:58.380
when one is baptised in the Holy Spirit, under complete dominion of the Holy Ghost.

0:21:58.380,0:22:10.500
But in that book of Acts when the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost,

0:22:10.500,0:22:20.840
without evidence of supernatural power.

0:22:20.840,0:22:25.400
So this is what the book of Ephesians 5:18 says there.

0:22:25.400,0:22:36.900
That all Christians must be filled by the Holy Ghost.

0:22:36.900,0:22:39.600
All Christians must be what?

0:22:39.600,0:22:41.560
[To be filled by the Holy Ghost.]

0:22:41.560,0:22:59.180
To be filled with the Holy Ghost is an optional matter - that is, leaves one with an option.

0:22:59.180,0:23:09.780
Will leave you with what? - An option.

0:23:09.780,0:23:15.100
It is a key area of the Scripture. I will take it one by one.

0:23:15.100,0:23:18.800
Because what is going on today, you can't imagine.

0:23:18.800,0:23:25.800
You don't know Christians; we don't know apostles; we don't know unbelievers again.

0:23:25.800,0:23:28.860
It is a level.

0:23:28.860,0:23:34.320
So people carry a dangerous mission today.

0:23:34.320,0:23:42.300
Once you become born again, you see people praying for people, for miracles,

0:23:42.300,0:23:46.180
praying for people for this, fasting or whatever.

0:23:46.180,0:23:53.400
The baptism of the Holy Ghost was Christ's baptism,

0:23:53.400,0:24:04.160
in the sense that no one else could administer it but Jesus alone.

0:24:04.160,0:24:12.240
No one - that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.

0:24:12.240,0:24:19.660
It was wholly divine and human hands could not be used.

0:24:19.660,0:24:27.600
That is baptism of the Holy Ghost.

0:24:27.600,0:24:34.280
And all that are baptised in the Holy Ghost are filled with the Holy Ghost.

0:24:34.280,0:24:43.800
But not all that are filled with the Holy Ghost are baptised in the Holy Ghost.

0:24:43.800,0:24:46.480
I will try to demonstrate what I'm talking about.

0:24:46.480,0:24:53.460
It is like soaking a rug in water or oil

0:24:53.460,0:24:55.540
Leave it for a while.

0:24:55.540,0:25:00.340
When you now bring it out, you will see it dropping the oil.

0:25:00.340,0:25:12.360
The one that is dropping is the fullness.

0:25:12.360,0:25:15.860
To be filled with the Holy Ghost is the one dropping from this.

0:25:15.860,0:25:25.240
But the one that is soaked is that baptised one.

0:25:25.240,0:25:46.480
Baptism experience of the Holy Ghost will not leave man's spirit free.

0:25:46.480,0:25:56.300
In every step, in every moment, a suggestion must come from the Spirit.

0:25:56.300,0:25:59.940
"Go!" - suggestion must come from the Spirit to go.

0:25:59.940,0:26:13.880
But in the case of a Christian, you must be filled; there is an option.

0:26:13.880,0:26:26.060
Be filled with the Holy Ghost - this is what the Bible says. There is a difference.

Be filled with the Holy Ghost.

I have a Friend who never fails
Forevermore

Listen to that!

0:27:10.580,0:27:18.320

another Comforter, another Helper.

Jesus never fails

Thank you. Did you listen to what Jesus said?

0:27:53.400,0:27:59.120
He said, "I will not leave you as an orphan".

0:27:59.120,0:28:09.780
But if you step aside, it gives the supernatural Guest a chance,

0:28:09.780,0:28:15.920
"Ok, take over. But I will be there".

0:28:15.920,0:28:22.040
What are you doing with your supernatural Guest?

0:28:22.040,0:28:23.920
Didn't you hear what the Bible says?

0:28:23.920,0:28:42.240
The Holy Spirit is not known, not received by everyone - only those who prepare for Him.

0:28:42.240,0:28:45.820
Are you?

0:28:45.820,0:28:49.700
You know Jesus; you know the Holy Spirit.

0:28:49.700,0:28:55.200
The Apostles knew Jesus; they knew the Holy Spirit.

0:28:55.200,0:29:00.800
Tell your neighbour, "You know Jesus; you know the Holy Spirit.

0:29:00.800,0:29:08.860
The Apostles knew Jesus; they knew the Holy Ghost.
