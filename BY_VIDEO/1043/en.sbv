0:00:00.020,0:00:04.060
My name is Nkoyo Udo from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:00:04.080,0:00:08.100
The person next to me is my sister and her baby.

0:00:08.100,0:00:11.260
Mrs Nkoyo Udo & Family
Akwa Ibom, Nigeria

0:00:11.260,0:00:19.260
This one next to her is her in-law. This is my sister. This is my sister and her husband.

0:00:19.260,0:00:22.140
Mrs Nkoyo Udo & Family
Akwa Ibom, Nigeria

0:00:22.140,0:00:27.440
We are here to share a wonderful testimony to the glory of God.

0:00:27.440,0:00:30.800
It all started November 2017

0:00:30.800,0:00:34.980
when my sister went to the hospital for delivery.

0:00:34.980,0:00:41.620
When she went, the doctor tested her and told her that she would not be able to deliver

0:00:41.620,0:00:45.520
without an operation.

0:00:45.520,0:00:51.840
And immediately the doctor made mention of operation, we were scared

0:00:51.840,0:00:56.160
because of what was involved.

0:00:56.160,0:01:02.820
And immediately my sister called me, I rushed down from the office to the hospital.

0:01:02.820,0:01:08.820
I told the doctor that he should wait. That he should let me seek the face of God first.

0:01:08.820,0:01:12.520
I picked up my phone. I called the prayer line.

0:01:12.520,0:01:16.240
That this was what was happening.  The person at the prayer line told me, "No problem.

0:01:16.240,0:01:19.400
That in every situation God is saying something.

0:01:19.400,0:01:24.740
That nothing will happen to my sister and the baby".

0:01:24.740,0:01:29.620
I had faith in these words.

0:01:29.620,0:01:33.120
And we tried.

0:01:33.120,0:01:40.260
We couldn't succeed normally like that and later resolved on having the operation.

0:01:40.260,0:01:46.620
My sister still underwent an operation.

0:01:46.620,0:01:52.780
Before the operation, the doctor told me that they were trying inside to see

0:01:52.780,0:01:59.960
how they could remove the baby but it was not possible. They had to use forceps.

0:01:59.960,0:02:08.920
When they were using the forceps, due to mismanagement, the baby got injured.

0:02:08.920,0:02:17.180
As it was a private hospital, they didn't have the equipment to treat the baby.

0:02:17.180,0:02:25.640
The doctor then transferred my sister and the baby to the General Hospital.

0:02:25.640,0:02:32.300
When they went there, the situation became worse.

0:02:32.300,0:02:37.760
They first asked, "What happened to the baby before they transferred the baby to the hospital?"

0:02:37.760,0:02:43.720
The baby got injured as you can see on the picture that has been placed here.

0:02:43.720,0:02:46.480
The baby got injured.

0:02:46.480,0:02:52.320
This is the picture of the baby on the screen of the televisión.

0:02:52.320,0:02:58.580
And you can even see right there the baby's brain, which was very, very dangerous.

0:02:58.580,0:03:03.980
When I asked the doctor, "What are we going to do now at the hospital?",

0:03:03.980,0:03:07.220
the doctor told me, "I have not seen such a case before.

0:03:07.220,0:03:12.040
That we need to try; in this situation, it is 50/50".

0:03:12.040,0:03:17.280
I was shocked. I didn't know what to do at that particular moment.

0:03:17.300,0:03:23.620
I told my sister, "What I want to do is that ... I believe in the God of T.B. Joshua.

0:03:23.620,0:03:26.080
He will never disappoint me.

0:03:26.080,0:03:31.720
Being a member here and also a partner, that stepping my feet here at the arena of Liberty,

0:03:31.720,0:03:34.700
that indeed, I will come back with a testimony".

0:03:34.700,0:03:36.720
And I came here.

0:03:36.720,0:03:43.740
When I came here in November 2017, I was opportune to be placed in the prayer line.

0:03:43.740,0:03:46.540
When I was in the prayer line, the man of God prayed for me.

0:03:46.540,0:03:51.300
At that time, I used this picture you saw on the board as the medium of contact

0:03:51.300,0:03:55.460
because I couldn't bring my sister and the baby down to The SCOAN.

0:03:55.460,0:03:59.500
When the man of God was praying for me, I believed in my mind,

0:03:59.500,0:04:03.560
"Definitely, he is praying for my sister right there at the hospital".

0:04:03.560,0:04:08.240
I was also opportune to be given the New Morning Water.

0:04:08.240,0:04:18.620
I rushed down to the hospital when I went back to my state, Akwa Ibom.

0:04:18.620,0:04:23.558
I administered the New Morning Water on the baby on the first day and the mother.

0:04:23.560,0:04:30.860
With regard to the mother, after the operation, the wound refused to close.

0:04:30.860,0:04:36.900
The doctor told me, "We tried. It didn´t close. We are going to stitch her again".

0:04:36.900,0:04:41.940
I said, "No, doctor! It will be very painful and you should not do that".

0:04:41.940,0:04:44.960
My sister was still crying and I said, "What am I going to do?"

0:04:44.960,0:04:49.940
I told my sister, "Just calm down. When I come back from where I want to go,

0:04:49.940,0:04:52.280
definitely you will have a testimony".

0:04:52.280,0:05:00.180
When I returned from The SCOAN, I put a demand on the annointing in this place.

0:05:00.180,0:05:07.020
Because my papa, my mentor T.B. Joshua, usually says that in every situation God is still saying something

0:05:07.020,0:05:11.620
and our situation is not like that of others. These words motivated me.

0:05:11.620,0:05:16.500
I rushed from Akwa Ibom State down here and was privileged to get the New Morning Water.

0:05:16.500,0:05:20.140
I administered that New Morning Water on the baby and my sister.

0:05:20.140,0:05:27.460
Surprisingly - tell your neighbour, "Surprisingly" -

0:05:27.460,0:05:39.400
the wound began to close, close, close, close.

0:05:39.400,0:05:42.260
This was something the doctor told me before I left,

0:05:42.260,0:05:45.860
"My sister, I don't think it will be possible for the next eight months

0:05:45.860,0:05:48.060
for this baby to be here in the hospital".

0:05:48.060,0:05:50.960
I then asked, "What happened? How are we going to get the money

0:05:50.960,0:05:57.700
because drugs there on a daily basis - you buy one for 10.000, 15.000, 7.000 -

0:05:57.700,0:06:00.960
before we knew it, all that we had got exhausted.

0:06:00.960,0:06:04.040
We didn't have money again. I said, "Ok, this last money that is remaining,

0:06:04.040,0:06:07.140
let me rush down to The SCOAN".

0:06:07.140,0:06:12.700
So when the wound started closing, brethren, I was surprised.

0:06:12.700,0:06:18.780
After four days...

0:06:18.780,0:06:25.300
Hallelujah! We can see on the screen the same spot where the baby was injured

0:06:25.300,0:06:33.460
and the sore was widening and widening until the sister came to The SCOAN

0:06:33.460,0:06:37.660
with a picture of the mother and the baby and interceded on their behalf,

0:06:37.660,0:06:41.080
received prayer from the man of God and got the New Morning Water.

0:06:41.100,0:06:44.180
She went back to meet the baby and the mother in the hospital,

0:06:44.180,0:06:51.080
ministered the New Morning Water and the wound that was so wide and so deep that you could see the brain

0:06:51.080,0:06:56.540
of the little baby started closing up and that is the result we can see today.

0:06:56.540,0:07:08.540
It is completely healed. Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus!

0:07:08.540,0:07:14.700
As there was not enough blood in my sister, they stored the fibroid when they did the operation.

0:07:14.700,0:07:17.280
They couldn't remove the fibroid because of the blood.

0:07:17.280,0:07:21.580
And at that particular time there was no blood to transfuse.

0:07:21.580,0:07:29.440
And the fibroid was still there. After three days, my sister began to swell up everywhere -

0:07:29.440,0:07:33.660
I was shocked! I said, "How can I lose two people at the same time! God forbid such a bad thing!

0:07:33.660,0:07:37.300
I cannot serve a living God and be disappointed". I was crying.

0:07:37.300,0:07:45.720
I was praying. I was meditating and indeed God of T.B. Joshua that I serve did wonders!

0:07:45.720,0:07:52.120
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:07:52.120,0:08:00.180
After three days of ministration of the New Morning Wáter, I had a dream.

0:08:00.180,0:08:03.040
The man of God appeared to me in my dream

0:08:03.040,0:08:09.380
and told me that he was just coming for me and the baby alone, not for any other person;

0:08:09.380,0:08:13.860
that I should rush to the hospital and bring the baby.

0:08:13.860,0:08:19.160
I did. I rushed down and brought the baby to him.

0:08:19.160,0:08:25.000
I didn't even know what the man of God put on the baby's head at that spot

0:08:25.000,0:08:29.040
but I saw his hand like this on the spot.

0:08:29.040,0:08:35.760
When I saw the hand, the man of God prayed for the baby and said, "Take the baby.

0:08:35.760,0:08:38.960
She is free. She is healed".

0:08:38.960,0:08:45.240
Mrs Nkoyo Udo & Family
Akwa Ibom, Nigeria

0:08:45.240,0:08:50.000
The baby I'm talking about is not far away -

0:08:50.000,0:08:53.320
she's here, right here in our midst.

0:08:53.320,0:09:02.280
Immediately after the dream, after one week, the wound closed totally.

0:09:02.280,0:09:07.340
Hallelujah!

0:09:07.340,0:09:10.920
At the earlier stage, before I came to The SCOAN, the doctor told me

0:09:10.920,0:09:17.420
that they had not seen such a case before, the wound was too wide,

0:09:17.420,0:09:21.280
the baby's brain had opened and they couldn't do anything

0:09:21.280,0:09:27.120
but they were going to do what they could - medically.

0:09:27.120,0:09:32.740
When the doctor came out and told me that, I told him

0:09:32.740,0:09:38.300
that I believe that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is still saying something

0:09:38.300,0:09:41.680
and definitely, He will still say something.

0:09:41.680,0:09:44.760
So when I went back and administered the New Morning Water,

0:09:44.760,0:09:51.880
and the doctor saw that the wound was completely closed, he was surprised.

0:09:51.880,0:09:57.360
One of the nurses that saw when I administered the New Morning Water on the baby asked me,

0:09:57.360,0:10:01.000
"Madam, I saw you holding something in your hand. What was that?"

0:10:01.000,0:10:04.640
I told her, "Madam, do you care to know what I was holding in my hand that day?"

0:10:04.640,0:10:07.320
She said, "Yes, because I have not seen this kind of thing before.

0:10:07.320,0:10:13.120
This wound is not even up to two months and the baby is completely healed!"

0:10:13.120,0:10:21.580
I told the doctor that it was the New Morning Water from The SCOAN; where I belong.

0:10:21.580,0:10:26.440
And today, this is my sister and this is the baby.

0:10:26.440,0:10:30.480
They are completely healed to the glory of God!

0:10:30.480,0:10:38.620
Amen. Thank You, Jesus! Let´s clap for Jesus one more time!

0:10:38.620,0:10:41.880
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:10:41.880,0:10:49.700
I am Inobo Akban and the baby I'm carrying is my daughter, Destiny Akban.

0:10:49.700,0:10:52.980
I´m from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).

0:10:52.980,0:10:56.360
My sister has said it all!

0:10:56.360,0:11:02.280
I was the one that was in pain. I was sick. I didn't know anything.

0:11:02.280,0:11:08.780
Even the hospital that they transferred my daughter to, it was my mother that stayed with my daughter

0:11:08.780,0:11:21.140
at that hospital for four days before the doctor told me to go and stay with my daughter at the hospital.

0:11:21.140,0:11:34.380
When my sister came back from The SCOAN, that was when I knew that I am a living soul.

0:11:34.380,0:11:38.340
Now I feel very happy!

0:11:38.340,0:11:42.980
I'm glad that my baby is alive. I am alive.

0:11:42.980,0:11:47.680
When I saw the wound at the Teaching Hospital, I was crying all through.

0:11:47.680,0:11:54.480
When my health was bad, when I was down, I was even asking God, "Why?

0:11:54.480,0:12:00.680
Why this pain for a baby that is just coming into the world and that has not done anything,

0:12:00.680,0:12:02.620
that does not not know anything?"

0:12:02.620,0:12:05.820
But God was still consoling me.

0:12:05.820,0:12:12.740
My sister tried her best as a sister to rush down to meet the man of God.

0:12:12.740,0:12:21.860
The head that I was unable to touch at that time, now I can touch that place.

0:12:21.860,0:12:24.180
I can touch my baby's head.

0:12:24.180,0:12:29.180
Everywhere was soft. It was only this place that was strong on this head.

0:12:29.180,0:12:34.780
But now everywhere is strong. Praise the Lord!  Emmanuel!

0:12:34.780,0:12:39.200
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:39.200,0:12:40.280
Thank you!

0:12:40.280,0:12:46.700
My advice to the whole world and the people that are seated here

0:12:46.700,0:12:51.780
is that when you have a problem, when you are terrified,

0:12:51.780,0:12:57.200
don't run to satan, don't run to a witch doctor,

0:12:57.200,0:13:02.560
run to God because God is the Author and the Finisher of everything.

0:13:02.560,0:13:04.200
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:13:04.200,0:13:07.260
Thank you!

0:13:07.260,0:13:09.860
So, let's just hear a word or two from a brother here.

0:13:09.860,0:13:13.260
Tell us your name and who is the woman to you?

0:13:13.260,0:13:15.280
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:13:15.280,0:13:17.860
My name is Ennis Akban.in-law.

0:13:17.860,0:13:24.240
The woman here by my side is my sister-in-law - the wife of my elder brother.

0:13:24.240,0:13:29.840
I'm here to thank God for what God has done for our family

0:13:29.840,0:13:34.180
because what no man can do is very possible before God

0:13:34.180,0:13:37.220
and He has all the ability to change things.

0:13:37.220,0:13:40.640
We are so amazed and so surprised to see this kind of thing happen.

0:13:40.640,0:13:43.640
That's why we all came as a family to thank God.

0:13:43.640,0:13:46.460
I want to thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:13:46.460,0:13:51.060
We had been hearing this name, and my sister kept on telling us to come.

0:13:51.060,0:13:53.980
We never thought it was this kind of thing.

0:13:53.980,0:13:58.920
I have seen proof and evidence; that's why I believe in Him.

0:13:58.920,0:14:02.160
The Bible says,  "Believe God and you will succeed.

0:14:02.160,0:14:05.060
But when you believe the prophets, you shall prosper".

0:14:05.060,0:14:08.660
So that's why we all came because we now believe what we have seen.

0:14:08.660,0:14:10.520
I say, "May the Lord bless him".

0:14:10.520,0:14:13.080
And I want to advise everybody:

0:14:13.080,0:14:16.060
The devil only comes to intimidate you.

0:14:16.060,0:14:20.980
Don't allow whatever he brings your way to take you to a witch doctor

0:14:20.980,0:14:23.280
because you will lose direction.

0:14:23.280,0:14:27.840
Every problem coming to you, God wants you to take that problem to Him

0:14:27.840,0:14:32.240
because He has something to do in your life. Blessed be the name of the Lord!

0:14:32.240,0:14:36.480
Put your hands together for Jesús!

0:14:36.480,0:14:39.040
Thank you very much.  Thank you.

0:14:39.040,0:14:45.740
Finally, sister, what is your word of advice?

0:14:45.740,0:14:51.880
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:14:51.880,0:15:02.160
My advice first goes to the people who are still yet to partner with EmmanuelTV.

0:15:02.160,0:15:08.280
I want to advise you that you should not delay anymore.

0:15:08.280,0:15:19.800
Since I started partnering with this ministry, I have not been disappointed in life.

0:15:19.800,0:15:23.340
I have seen so many things happening to me -

0:15:23.340,0:15:30.400
breakthrough in my career, finances, in so many ways.

0:15:30.400,0:15:34.880
Then secondly, to the viewers all over the world

0:15:34.880,0:15:40.540
and to those that are seated right here in this auditorium.

0:15:40.540,0:15:47.240
I want to advise you that in every situation, God is still saying something;

0:15:47.260,0:15:51.440
that in God, there is no impossibility.

0:15:51.440,0:15:54.180
With God, everything is possible.

0:15:54.180,0:15:59.700
Any situation or challenge - because our Papa, T.B. Joshua, my mentor usually says

0:15:59.700,0:16:04.480
that it is not any other thing than a mere challenge.

0:16:04.480,0:16:07.860
Anything you came here with today,

0:16:07.860,0:16:14.280
believe that as you're going, you're going with a testimony.

We want to congratulate the baby's mother and the baby

We also want to encourage you to remember that you were healed by the grace of God through His Word.

0:16:36.120,0:16:39.420
So make His Word the standard for your life

and also train up this child in the way of the Lord so that when she grows up, she will not depart from it.

Remember, for God Almighty to save the life of this child,

We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to train her up in the way of the Lord, in Jesus' name.
