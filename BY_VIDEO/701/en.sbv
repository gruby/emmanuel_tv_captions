DELIVERANCE TIME

0:00:00.540,0:00:03.660
Here is Wise Man Racine moving in the midst of the congregation

0:00:03.660,0:00:08.020
of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations during a typical Sunday Service.

0:00:08.020,0:00:12.420
As he prays, God uses the wise man as an instrument of deliverance

0:00:12.420,0:00:15.600
where there is bondage in the lives of the multitudes.

0:00:15.600,0:00:21.120
And the unclean spirits behind their problems are exposed and forced to come out.

0:00:21.120,0:00:25.160
Indeed, to know God's presence is to know God's power.

0:00:25.160,0:00:28.620
As Wise Man Racine continues to move in the midst of the congregation,

0:00:28.620,0:00:34.480
he prays for this lady who immediately falls to the ground under the superior power of God.

0:00:34.480,0:00:40.060
Let's see what happens in her, following an encounter with Wise Man Racine.

0:00:40.060,0:00:45.660
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, you unclean spirit, come out of this body!

0:00:45.660,0:00:58.360
The spirit of credit, you cannot remove it.

0:00:58.360,0:01:02.560
Nobody!

0:01:02.560,0:01:05.560
For how long have you been tormenting her life?

0:01:05.560,0:01:10.640
Over 16 years. Nobody can do it.

0:01:10.640,0:01:12.180
Nobody!

0:01:12.180,0:01:14.400
How did you enter her life?

0:01:14.400,0:01:17.680
Through the bush.

0:01:17.680,0:01:24.620
Ancestral spirit - you cannot remove that spirit.

0:01:24.620,0:01:29.440
The spirit of credit - you cannot remove it.

0:01:29.440,0:01:34.720
My ears are blocked.

0:01:34.720,0:01:36.440
Please, my ears.

0:01:36.440,0:01:41.520
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:41.520,0:01:44.220
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:44.220,0:01:47.320
In Jesus' name, you are free.

0:01:47.320,0:01:50.500
Glory be to Jesus Christ, you heard the voice of the evil spirit

0:01:50.500,0:01:55.280
that it is the spirit of credit, and she has been delivered to the glory of God.

0:01:55.280,0:01:57.060
Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:57.060,0:02:00.560
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:02:00.560,0:02:04.260
My name is Esse. I come from Warri (Nigeria).

0:02:04.260,0:02:05.640
I sell food.

0:02:05.640,0:02:16.580
I sell rice, fried rice, jollof rice, salad, chicken, ogwo, eba, egusi, ogbono.

0:02:16.580,0:02:19.100
Everything is sold at my store.

0:02:19.100,0:02:21.100
I sell the food but I don't see the money.

0:02:21.100,0:02:23.200
It's my own money I used to start the business.

0:02:23.200,0:02:27.420
As I sell, I don't see the money; all the money seems to vanish.

0:02:27.420,0:02:30.080
I told my sister that all my money had gone.

0:02:30.080,0:02:32.400
She said I should borrow money.

0:02:32.400,0:02:34.180
I started to borrow money.

0:02:34.180,0:02:38.660
I borrowed to sell food and the money vanished again.

0:02:38.660,0:02:41.900
My sister borrowed money for me.

0:02:41.900,0:02:44.800
She said she sells all sorts of food.

0:02:44.800,0:02:50.360
Whenever she sells food, she doesn't see the result of the products she's selling.

0:02:50.360,0:02:52.380
Instead she keeps on borrowing money,

0:02:52.380,0:02:55.900
to the extent that her sister also assisted her in borrowing money

0:02:55.900,0:03:00.280
in order to make up for the loss she had been making from selling food.

0:03:00.280,0:03:03.800
I borrowed money but I couldn't pay it back.

0:03:03.800,0:03:05.800
People would come to ask for their money and we would fight.

0:03:05.800,0:03:10.660
The father of my children does security work, earning N8,000 a month.

0:03:10.660,0:03:13.360
He said people were coming to fight with him,

0:03:13.360,0:03:16.980
so since he never paid my bride price, I should pack my things and go!

0:03:16.980,0:03:18.320
We've just heard from the woman.

0:03:18.320,0:03:23.160
She said in the course of selling the food stuff she had been cooking,

0:03:23.160,0:03:25.640
she had never made any gain from what she has been selling.

0:03:25.640,0:03:28.680
So she went about borrowing from here and there to the extent that

0:03:28.680,0:03:33.120
her sister also assisted her in borrowing money, in order to make up for the loss

0:03:33.120,0:03:35.940
of selling the food and not making any gains.

0:03:35.940,0:03:38.580
To the point that her husband called her one day and said,

0:03:38.580,0:03:41.100
"Look, I've not even paid for your dowry

0:03:41.100,0:03:43.320
and you go about borrowing money here and there.

0:03:43.320,0:03:46.060
You'd better carry your problem and see how you solve it

0:03:46.060,0:03:48.220
because I'm not ready to carry it for you".

0:03:48.220,0:03:52.420
One day he said he was going to work, took some of his things and ran away.

0:03:52.420,0:03:54.700
I was inside the house with my children.

0:03:54.700,0:03:58.520
All the people I owed would come and some would beat me.

0:03:58.520,0:04:00.540
One day I came out of the house.

0:04:00.540,0:04:03.880
A woman came to my store to buy food.

0:04:03.880,0:04:07.380
The woman said, "Oh, Mama Rice, don't you sell food anymore?"

0:04:07.380,0:04:11.880
I told her I owed debts from my head to my toes.

0:04:11.880,0:04:15.580
She said that to the extent that one day her husband just came in,

0:04:15.580,0:04:19.120
took some of his clothes, and absconded. He ran away from her.

0:04:19.120,0:04:21.900
Since then, those people she had borrowed money from would come.

0:04:21.900,0:04:25.400
They would beat, scold, molest her.

0:04:25.400,0:04:27.080
Then one day a woman met her and said,

0:04:27.080,0:04:30.220
"Look, Madam Rice, you've not been selling food again, why?"

0:04:30.220,0:04:33.100
She told the woman she'd been borrowing money here and there.

0:04:33.100,0:04:36.520
And the woman said, "Look, I've got a solution to your problem".

0:04:36.520,0:04:41.200
The woman gave me an address and said that she knew a man who helped people.

0:04:41.200,0:04:44.620
I said, "Okay, will you take me to him?"

0:04:44.620,0:04:47.740
She said she would not take me there but she wrote the address for me.

0:04:47.740,0:04:51.320
She said if I took the three children, he would solve my problem.

0:04:51.320,0:04:52.320
I said okay.

0:04:52.320,0:04:55.300
She said that if I took my children, the man would solve my problem.

0:04:55.300,0:04:56.300
I agreed.

0:04:56.300,0:05:00.080
I went there and knocked on the door. The gateman said I should enter.

0:05:00.080,0:05:02.560
I entered. I didn't sit down but stood there.

0:05:02.560,0:05:05.360
A man came out of a room.

0:05:05.360,0:05:09.160
He said before I came, they had already told him my problem.

0:05:09.160,0:05:10.740
I said, "Thank God!"

0:05:10.740,0:05:16.640
He said that a person uses what he has to solve his problem.

0:05:16.640,0:05:21.080
I said that if I had something, I would use it to solve my problem.

0:05:21.100,0:05:27.000
He said he wanted to buy this child for N400,000.

0:05:27.000,0:05:28.380
You've listened to the woman.

0:05:28.380,0:05:32.260
She said she met a lady who said she had a solution to her problem.

0:05:32.260,0:05:34.160
She said, no problem, she was ready to do it.

0:05:34.160,0:05:37.580
The lady then said, "When you are going to this place, I will not go with you.

0:05:37.580,0:05:42.000
I will give you the address, but make sure you take your three children along with you".

0:05:42.000,0:05:46.820
She went to the place. Immediately she got there, the security man opened the door for her.

0:05:46.820,0:05:49.080
When she went in, she met a man that said,

0:05:49.080,0:05:53.120
"Look, I already know your problem, and the only solution to your problem is

0:05:53.120,0:05:57.400
you give me one of your children for the sum of N400,000".

0:05:57.400,0:06:01.120
He said he would buy this kid and follow me to the bank to collect the money

0:06:01.120,0:06:03.440
I then said I would not be able to sell him.

0:06:03.440,0:06:05.400
I then walked out of the door.

0:06:05.400,0:06:08.140
He said, "Madam, think about it very well before you die in pain.

0:06:08.140,0:06:09.680
Those people will kill you".

0:06:09.680,0:06:11.500
When I got home, I thought about it.

0:06:11.500,0:06:18.160
My mind told me that I should just drop the child and leave.

0:06:18.160,0:06:20.800
She said after she met the man and he told her,

0:06:20.800,0:06:25.160
"Look, I'm going to buy one of your sons for N 400,000",

0:06:25.160,0:06:29.520
she left and the man said, "Look, you know your problem is so great.

0:06:29.520,0:06:33.200
You'd better think about it and come back to me so that your problem will be solved".

0:06:33.200,0:06:35.880
She said when she left the place, she started thinking about it,

0:06:35.880,0:06:41.060
"Why don't I just drop this child and get the money and solve my problem".

0:06:41.060,0:06:45.880
As I was thinking like that, a woman came. She used to sell garri to me.

0:06:45.880,0:06:49.560
When I didn't have money to pay, she would give food for me and my children to eat.

0:06:49.560,0:06:54.060
I told her that I was going to take this child and solve the problem.

0:06:54.060,0:06:57.460
The woman shouted and said, "Do you want to sell your own child?"

0:06:57.460,0:07:00.940
The money she had earned from selling garri that morning, she lent it to me.

0:07:00.940,0:07:04.400
She said I should use the money for transport and leave Warri immediately.

0:07:04.400,0:07:06.400
I told her that I would not be able to leave at that time

0:07:06.400,0:07:08.960
because the people I was owing would know I was running away.

0:07:08.960,0:07:12.120
She said that I should go to sleep like somebody who had not heard anything.

0:07:12.120,0:07:18.580
As the day was breaking, I woke up the children. I told them we were going to Lagos

0:07:18.580,0:07:21.020
but I didn't know where we were going in Lagos.

0:07:21.020,0:07:22.940
I said we were going to Lagos.

0:07:22.940,0:07:25.160
My daughter asked me, "Mommy, where are we going?"

0:07:25.160,0:07:28.700
I said, "If they kill us, we die; if they don't kill us, we live".

0:07:28.700,0:07:31.740
She said while she was thinking about going back to the man

0:07:31.740,0:07:36.080
to collect the sum of N400,000 to sell her son to the man,

0:07:36.080,0:07:40.260
a woman met her who had been assisting her, giving her food.

0:07:40.260,0:07:41.940
She asked, "Why are you crying? What is the problem?"

0:07:41.940,0:07:47.820
She said, "Look, I met a man who wants to buy my son for N400,000 so I could pay my debt".

0:07:47.820,0:07:50.980
The woman told her, "No, you dont need to do that. I'm going to assist you,

0:07:50.980,0:07:53.500
give you some money so that you can travel down to Lagos".

0:07:53.500,0:07:56.640
When I was leaving at 2 am, I woke up these children.

0:07:56.640,0:08:02.220
I brought some cheap plastic bags and put their clothes in before we left.

0:08:02.220,0:08:07.400
We started at 2 AM and crossed a bridge.

0:08:07.400,0:08:09.760
That day, I thought we would die.

0:08:09.760,0:08:14.900
When we got to Osarame Park, I cried out.

0:08:14.900,0:08:18.240
The manager asked me, "Madam, what brought you here this early morning?"

0:08:18.240,0:08:21.280
I started crying and told him I was on the run

0:08:21.280,0:08:23.600
and that I owed debts from my head to my toes.

0:08:23.600,0:08:25.100
I told him that I wanted to sell my child.

0:08:25.100,0:08:30.920
He said, "No, just run to The SCOAN and that God would answer you".

0:08:30.920,0:08:37.640
After that, the man booked tickets for me to get here for free.

0:08:37.640,0:08:41.040
She said that after she left at midnight because she thought

0:08:41.040,0:08:44.660
the people she was owing money to would arrest her or think she was running away,

0:08:44.660,0:08:47.720
The woman told her, "Look, very early morning go to the park".

0:08:47.720,0:08:52.300
When she got to the park, she didn't have money to travel on the bus to Lagos.

0:08:52.300,0:08:56.160
That was how she met the manager of the transport company.

0:08:56.160,0:09:00.540
The man asked her, "Madam, why are you standing here with these little children at this hour?"

0:09:00.540,0:09:05.260
She told the man, "Look, I'm about to sell my child for N400,000".

0:09:05.260,0:09:07.860
The man said, "No, you don't need to do that.

0:09:07.860,0:09:10.580
Enter the bus for free and travel down to Lagos".

0:09:10.580,0:09:13.420
And that's how she came down to The SCOAN.

0:09:13.420,0:09:22.780
Since she has been delivered, these children need to be given scholarship.

0:09:22.780,0:09:31.380
Also, we are to give her N400,000 so she can pay her debts.

0:09:31.380,0:09:33.280
And give them 5 bags of rice.

0:09:33.280,0:09:36.760
This is what my whole family could not pay.

0:09:36.760,0:09:44.880
For the rest of my life, they could not pay this money.

0:09:44.880,0:09:48.880
I want to challenge the congregation to come together.

0:09:48.880,0:09:56.640
Apart from this N400,000, contribute at least N100,000 for her to continue her business.

0:09:56.640,0:09:59.100
This money is to pay the debts.

0:09:59.100,0:10:02.840
Five bags of rice and scholarships - the church will give that.

0:10:02.840,0:10:08.680
We should come together and give another N100,000 for her to start her business.

0:10:13.820,0:10:16.740
Thank You, Jesus!

0:10:16.740,0:10:19.420
I thank the man of God for what he has done for me.

0:10:19.420,0:10:24.080
My whole generation could not pay. My brothers and sisters could not pay.

0:10:24.080,0:10:27.680
I thank God for today!

0:10:27.680,0:10:31.000
Help me thank God and the man of God.

0:10:31.000,0:10:34.300
We have people like this in the society.

0:10:34.300,0:10:40.620
If these children are not cared for, they will become another thing in the future.

0:10:40.620,0:10:43.000
What can we do for you, sir?

0:10:43.000,0:10:46.620
I came from Warri too. I want to assist her with N100,000.

0:10:46.620,0:10:48.160
You want to give her N100,000?

0:10:48.160,0:10:49.300
Yes.

0:10:49.300,0:10:52.140
Thank you.

0:10:52.140,0:10:54.480
Can you see what I'm talking about?

0:10:54.480,0:10:59.800
Many who are here today are crying in their spirit and soul.

0:10:59.800,0:11:03.500
They know they can do better than what they are doing.

0:11:03.500,0:11:07.800
Look at this woman from Warri.

0:11:07.800,0:11:14.220
We have people here from the Eastern communities to this place who are millionaires

0:11:14.220,0:11:17.100
but they cannot help her.

0:11:17.100,0:11:22.080
They keep helping others who will say, "Thank you"

0:11:22.080,0:11:25.480
because they have nothing to gain from this woman.

0:11:25.480,0:11:32.040
She's not a young lady; they cannot go out with her.

0:11:32.040,0:11:34.300
She has children; they cannot marry her.

0:11:34.300,0:11:37.280
There's nothing you can do; she will become a burden to them.

0:11:37.280,0:11:41.940
You can't put her in your office to be your clerk or manager.

0:11:41.940,0:11:48.220
You can't send her on any errand. So they feel helping her is of no use.

0:11:48.220,0:11:55.940
These are the kind of people you should raise.

0:11:55.940,0:11:59.660
We come from different backgrounds.

0:11:59.660,0:12:01.840
Today is Sunday; yesterday was Saturday.

0:12:01.840,0:12:07.160
Many came from parties where they danced and displayed money.

0:12:07.160,0:12:12.760
Many from clubs - social clubs, community clubs, different backgrounds.

0:12:12.760,0:12:15.680
Many went to weddings yesterday, or funerals.

0:12:15.680,0:12:19.580
In those places, they displayed money; they showed off money.

0:12:19.580,0:12:22.260
But here is the house of God.

0:12:22.260,0:12:25.860
Why can't we let the world know the value of money?

0:12:25.860,0:12:30.500
The real value of money is to help our fellow brothers.

0:12:30.500,0:12:35.160
You are blessed to bless others.

0:12:35.160,0:12:37.500
That is the real value.

0:12:37.500,0:12:43.940
The real value is to help the needy.

0:12:43.940,0:12:48.240
You are because I am; I am because you are.

0:12:48.240,0:12:55.160
Where I'm weak, you are strong; where I'm strong, you are weak.

0:12:55.160,0:12:57.680
So what we are doing now is to tell you that,

0:12:57.680,0:13:00.260
when you leave here today,

0:13:00.260,0:13:04.260
don't let your fellow brother come to you and say, "I need your help".

0:13:04.260,0:13:06.280
Even at the house where you are living,

0:13:06.280,0:13:10.600
how can you see little children on Monday, Tuesday roaming about?

0:13:10.600,0:13:13.780
And you cannot ask them, "Are you not going to school?

0:13:13.780,0:13:16.260
What are you doing at home?"

0:13:16.260,0:13:18.120
By the time you meet the parents, they will tell you,

0:13:18.120,0:13:20.520
"We are very sorry, we cannot afford the school fees".

0:13:20.520,0:13:23.100
Come to their aid.

0:13:23.100,0:13:24.940
In many homes you are living in,

0:13:24.940,0:13:29.200
every day, the tenants fight with the landlords.

0:13:29.200,0:13:31.560
You always hear their voices.

0:13:31.560,0:13:35.680
Why can't you come to their aid and ask the landlord what the problem is.

0:13:35.680,0:13:39.100
The landlord would say, "The problem is that he refuses to pay house rent".

0:13:39.100,0:13:41.100
Why can't you call the tenant,

0:13:41.100,0:13:44.600
"What is the problem? Do you want to live here? How much do you need?"

0:13:44.600,0:13:52.160
Help; settle them down. Don't allow this marriage to lead to divorce.

0:13:52.160,0:13:59.580
Thank you.

0:13:59.580,0:14:08.560
The reason why we are doing this is to change your perception, belief and philosophy.

0:14:08.560,0:14:16.000
What you are used to is to give those who can give you, who appreciate you.

0:14:16.000,0:14:18.260
You love appreciation.

0:14:18.260,0:14:21.900
We just received a phone call on one of our prayer lines,

0:14:21.900,0:14:24.640
by one of the viewers who was watching Emmanuel TV

0:14:24.640,0:14:28.500
and he saw the woman, listened to her pathetic story,

0:14:28.500,0:14:31.100
the woman who was delivered from the spirit of credit

0:14:31.100,0:14:34.540
and the man of God blessed her with the sum of N400,000.

0:14:34.540,0:14:44.520
The man said he's ready to pay her house rent and take care of her for one whole year.

0:14:53.680,0:15:03.380
The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV cannot go anywhere without the ministry of giving.

0:15:03.380,0:15:05.360
And what are we giving?

0:15:05.360,0:15:13.780
Love, strength, faithfulness, kindness, goodness,

0:15:13.780,0:15:16.720
every good thing the Lord has given us, money.

0:15:16.720,0:15:18.520
That is another ministry.

0:15:18.520,0:15:25.720
We must give it unconditionally.

0:15:25.720,0:15:38.200
Your money must have a place it's going to to raise the standard of living for the glory of God.

0:15:38.200,0:15:46.500
Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.

0:15:46.500,0:15:50.600
That is Christianity. It's all about relationship.

0:15:50.600,0:15:55.940
Tell you neighbour, "Christianity is all about relationship.

0:15:55.940,0:16:05.280
Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man".

0:16:10.720,0:16:13.900
My name is Esse, I came from Warri.

0:16:13.900,0:16:18.140
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of credit.

0:16:18.140,0:16:20.760
I owed but could not pay.

0:16:20.760,0:16:24.000
When I came to The SCOAN, I was sitting inside the church.

0:16:24.000,0:16:27.100
When the wise men were coming, my body began to shake.

0:16:27.100,0:16:29.460
I didn't know what they carried in their hands that made me shake.

0:16:29.460,0:16:31.860
Before I knew it, I found myself in front of the altar.

0:16:31.860,0:16:34.320
The man of God was asking, "Where is the woman who owes debt?"

0:16:34.320,0:16:39.240
She said that when she came here, she had an encounter with Wise Man Racine,

0:16:39.240,0:16:44.200
and the evil spirit that was in her life, the spirit of credit, was provoked,

0:16:44.200,0:16:49.140
and she was delivered from that spirit of credit.

0:16:49.140,0:16:53.120
Since the deliverance that day, my body feels so light.

0:16:53.120,0:16:56.360
There was a huge man who used to come to my dreams.

0:16:56.360,0:16:59.500
The last time the man came, after sleeping with me,

0:16:59.500,0:17:01.960
he used a handkerchief to clean up my body.

0:17:01.960,0:17:08.720
The day the wise man delivered me, I felt so free; I slept like a baby.

0:17:08.720,0:17:16.460
Today when I told the man of God my problem, the man of God told me

0:17:16.460,0:17:20.800
he would give me money and give my children scholarships.

0:17:20.800,0:17:24.660
Today, the man of God gave me the sum of N400,000

0:17:24.660,0:17:27.600
and a member of the church gave me N100,000,

0:17:27.600,0:17:31.780
which is N500,000 and five bags of rice.

0:17:31.780,0:17:39.380
The Emmanuel TV team promised me an apartment and feeding for one year.

0:17:39.380,0:17:43.640
Thank You, Jesus Christ! What an incredible transformation

0:17:43.640,0:17:45.720
that is taking place in her life.

0:17:45.720,0:17:49.920
She said that when she came here, the man of God, T.B. Joshua,

0:17:49.920,0:17:53.340
gave her the sum of N400,000 to pay off her debt.

0:17:53.340,0:17:57.240
Not only that, a member of the congregation came out

0:17:57.240,0:18:00.800
and blessed her with the sum of N100,000

0:18:00.800,0:18:04.600
to combine it together to pay off all her debt as well.

0:18:04.600,0:18:07.100
Not only that, she was also blessed with scholarship for her children

0:18:07.100,0:18:11.180
Not only that, she was also blessed with scholarships for her children and five bags of rice.

0:18:11.180,0:18:15.820
And if that wasn't enough, a person called the Emmanuel TV prayer line

0:18:15.820,0:18:23.300
and said that they wanted to sponsor and pay for her accomodation - her rent for an entire year.

0:18:23.300,0:18:26.500
I feel so happy because my whole generation couldn't pay the money.

0:18:26.500,0:18:30.140
May God guide him and his family

0:18:30.140,0:18:32.940
and give him long life and prosperity.

0:18:32.940,0:18:37.140
We want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your lives

0:18:37.140,0:18:42.260
so that your source of income can continue to come from God Almighty,

0:18:42.260,0:18:46.760
and make Jesus Christ the boss, the CEO, the director of all you do in life.

0:18:46.760,0:18:50.120
As you do so, your way will be prosperous and successful.

0:18:50.120,0:18:54.640
Anything you put your hand to will be prosperous in Jesus' mighty name.

0:18:54.640,0:18:55.460
Amen.
