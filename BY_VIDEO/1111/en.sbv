0:00:00.000,0:00:04.080
I have a message for my country and I want you to pray with me.

0:00:04.080,0:00:07.060
After the message, you join me in prayer.

0:00:07.060,0:00:09.580
This is three times I'm having this message.

0:00:09.580,0:00:13.120
Now I want to say it, it is the third time.

0:00:13.120,0:00:14.240
Yes.

0:00:14.240,0:00:16.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:16.240,0:00:23.240
The president's heart is like a stream of water in the hands of God.

0:00:23.240,0:00:25.140
Are you with me?

0:00:25.140,0:00:34.720
The president's, leader's heart is like a stream of water in the hands of God

0:00:34.720,0:00:39.580
and He can control it wherever He wants.

0:00:39.580,0:00:46.300
The first time I had the dream, I prayed and fasted on my own.

0:00:46.300,0:00:50.220
the second time again, I prayed and fasted,

0:00:50.220,0:00:53.680
But this third time, you must join me in prayer.

0:00:53.680,0:00:55.180
First, second, third.

0:00:55.180,0:01:00.920
When something is like that, you can imagine what - something strange.

0:01:00.920,0:01:05.700
So, you must join me in prayer because two believers are better than one.

0:01:05.700,0:01:11.780
For some time after my message to the nation that I am seeing us in the valley,

0:01:11.780,0:01:18.300
and our future is crying for help, since that time I keep to myself.

0:01:18.300,0:01:23.720
I should not go beyond God; I should go before Him.

0:01:23.720,0:01:29.660
The Lord said to me that I should tell the nation and leaders

0:01:29.660,0:01:39.080
to pray against the interruption of the democratic practice.

0:01:39.080,0:01:45.120
Pray against the interruption of democratic practice.

0:01:45.120,0:01:49.400
You have to join me in prayer for the nation.

0:01:49.400,0:01:52.860
The Lord gave me the prayers to offer as well

0:01:52.860,0:01:56.580
because in this case, there must be prayers given to you.

0:01:56.580,0:01:58.400
What are the prayers?

0:01:58.400,0:02:11.300
1. The Lord should give our leaders greater understanding of God's heart.

0:02:11.300,0:02:32.120
2. The Lord should give them the understanding and discretion to guide their hearts.

0:02:32.120,0:02:44.420
3. Give them understanding that will protect them and wisdom that will rescue them.

0:02:44.420,0:02:47.360
These are the prayers. Lift up your voice,

0:02:47.360,0:02:57.100
