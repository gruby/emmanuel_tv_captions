DELIVERANCE TIME

0:00:04.600,0:00:10.560
As the Evangelists sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua, minister the Morning Water to the congregation

0:00:10.560,0:00:13.460
at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,

0:00:13.460,0:00:18.120
all the demonic chains in the lives of the people are being broken.

0:00:18.120,0:00:26.660
Every chain satan might have used to connect them to himself come loose in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:26.660,0:00:32.220
Watch and see how this lady and her mother were delivered in Jesus' name.

0:00:33.200,0:00:37.440
In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus. Speak out, who are you?

0:00:37.440,0:00:38.860
Ministration of the Morning Water in Jesus' Name

0:00:38.860,0:00:41.980
You said you are who?

0:00:41.980,0:00:43.460
I am the spiritual husband.

0:00:43.460,0:00:45.120
Ok, how many of you are you in this body?

0:00:45.120,0:00:46.500
Stop it! Stop spraying!

0:00:46.500,0:00:49.220
How many of you are in this body? We don't have your time. How many of you are in this body?

0:00:49.220,0:00:50.180
How many of you?

0:00:50.180,0:00:51.480
Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:00:51.480,0:00:52.500
Idol.

0:00:52.500,0:00:53.400
You said you are what?

0:00:53.400,0:00:54.560
Idol.

0:00:54.560,0:00:57.600
As an idol and a spiritual husband, what have you done to her?

0:00:57.600,0:00:58.740
Stop it!

0:00:58.740,0:01:00.960
As an idol, speak out - what have you done to her?

0:01:00.960,0:01:06.300
I destroyed her and I want to kill her.

0:01:06.300,0:01:09.880
Her destiny is just too bright; I want to kill her.

0:01:09.880,0:01:12.580
How do you want to kill her - explain?

0:01:12.580,0:01:17.460
Her destiny is too bright; she wants to liberate the family.

0:01:17.460,0:01:18.500
What have you done to her career?

0:01:18.500,0:01:20.000
I don't want that.

0:01:20.000,0:01:21.300
What have you done to her career?

0:01:21.300,0:01:24.500
Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:01:24.500,0:01:26.880
Speak! What have you done to her career?

0:01:26.880,0:01:28.960
I put the spirit of anger in her.

0:01:28.960,0:01:32.960
She is very aggressive; I did it.

0:01:32.960,0:01:34.620
Don't spray that; I don't like it.

0:01:34.620,0:01:39.280
Open you eyes. Who is this woman beside you? Open your eyes!

0:01:39.280,0:01:41.380
Who is this woman beside you?

0:01:41.380,0:01:42.260
Who is she?

0:01:42.260,0:01:43.200
Her mother.

0:01:43.200,0:01:45.980
Madam, you are very welcome in Jesus' name.

0:01:45.980,0:01:47.600
Who is this lady?

0:01:47.600,0:01:49.080
She is my daughter.

0:01:49.080,0:01:52.160
What can you say about your daughter?

0:01:52.160,0:01:58.420
She has a bad character; she doesn't behave well.

0:01:58.420,0:02:00.780
She didn't finish school.

0:02:00.780,0:02:04.820
She gets sick and I have to rush her to the hospital.

0:02:04.820,0:02:07.680
Her father is an idol worshipper.

0:02:07.680,0:02:09.740
I rush her to the hospital every other day.

0:02:09.740,0:02:12.060
Who caused her all these setbacks?

0:02:12.060,0:02:12.880
Who is the cause?

0:02:12.880,0:02:14.120
It is me.

0:02:14.120,0:02:16.620
Right now, it is time for you to leave this body.

0:02:16.620,0:02:19.700
In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus - out!

0:02:19.700,0:02:21.700

In the mighty name of Jesus. At the command in the blood of Jesus, out of this body!

0:02:37.680,0:02:39.240
You are going.

0:02:39.240,0:02:41.920
Out!

0:02:41.920,0:02:43.920
Deliverance in Jesus' Name Through Ministration of the Morning Water

0:02:43.920,0:02:46.960
Whatever you have deposited in this body, begin to remove them!

0:02:46.960,0:02:49.440
Remove the crown!

0:02:49.440,0:02:50.700
Remove the ring!

0:02:50.700,0:02:53.700
In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus.

0:02:55.800,0:02:57.560
I command you out!

0:02:57.560,0:02:58.360
You said what?

0:02:58.360,0:02:59.400
There is something in my hair!

0:02:59.400,0:03:00.660
Remove it!

0:03:00.660,0:03:03.420
In the mighty name of Jesus, begin to remove it!

0:03:03.420,0:03:08.000
Whatever you have put on her head, that causes her setback -

0:03:08.000,0:03:12.980
Out!

0:03:12.980,0:03:14.700
In Jesus Christ's name!

0:03:14.700,0:03:15.860
Amen.

0:03:15.860,0:03:18.180

0:03:30.420,0:03:31.760

0:03:31.760,0:03:35.380
Madam, your daughter has been delivered today.

0:03:35.380,0:03:38.760
Do not remind her of what she has been delivered from today.

0:03:38.760,0:03:40.340
Otherwise, you shall be tempted.

0:03:40.340,0:03:41.060
Thank You, Jesus.

0:03:41.060,0:03:44.400

0:03:48.360,0:03:51.580
You demon, what have you done to her?

0:03:51.580,0:03:53.340
What have you caused this marriage?

0:03:53.340,0:03:54.880
What have you caused her family? Speak out!

0:04:30.540,0:04:32.940
I am the spirit of anger.

0:04:32.940,0:04:34.380
You are spirit of what?

0:04:34.380,0:04:35.160
Anger.

0:04:35.160,0:04:38.480
Ok. As a spirit of anger, what have you done to her?

0:04:38.480,0:04:39.660
What have you done to her?

What else - speak!

0:04:43.400,0:04:47.640
She always quarrels.

0:04:47.640,0:04:49.800
What else have you made her to do?

0:04:49.800,0:04:53.240

0:04:53.240,0:04:57.800

Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:05:17.120,0:05:19.360
Sister, you are very welcome.

0:05:19.360,0:05:20.860
Who is this woman to you?

0:05:20.860,0:05:21.840
She is my mother.

0:05:21.840,0:05:24.160
What can you say about your mom?

0:05:24.160,0:05:27.520
She used to quarrel over any little thing.

0:05:27.520,0:05:34.120
People she helps, all turn back against her; no one is asking after her.

0:05:34.120,0:05:36.320
Everybody in the family hates her.

0:05:36.320,0:05:38.040
Who is the cause of that?

0:05:38.040,0:05:40.260
Who is the cause?

0:05:46.660,0:05:48.740
How did you enter her?

0:05:48.740,0:05:52.200
How did you enter this body?

0:05:52.200,0:05:53.840
When she was small.

0:05:53.840,0:05:55.240
Ok. It is time for you to leave this body.

0:05:55.240,0:05:58.440
In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus - out!

0:05:58.440,0:05:59.700

TESTIMONY TIME

0:06:30.880,0:06:34.520
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:06:34.520,0:06:38.520
My name is Irabor Patience from Edo State.

0:06:38.520,0:06:41.660
The person standing beside me is my mother.

0:06:41.660,0:06:47.140
The other one is my elder brother, a graduate of Ambrose Alli University.

0:06:47.140,0:06:50.420
The other one is my cousin.

0:06:50.420,0:06:55.280
We all came here for our deliverance.

0:06:55.280,0:07:03.140
This spiritual husband had really affected me and my career.

0:07:03.140,0:07:08.000
Can you start by telling us what you were delivered from?

0:07:08.000,0:07:16.800
I was delivered from a spiritual husband, the spirit of idol from my father's house.

0:07:16.800,0:07:19.620
and from the spirit of prostitution.

0:07:19.620,0:07:22.420
This idol had really disturbed me.

0:07:22.420,0:07:25.380
We were all born into an idol family.

0:07:25.380,0:07:29.260
My father was an idol worshipper.

0:07:29.260,0:07:31.020
The thing had really disturbed us.

0:07:31.020,0:07:35.560
Ever since my dad died, the idol had been tormenting the children.

0:07:35.560,0:07:40.340
We had all become scattered and nothing was going well for us.

0:07:40.340,0:07:44.240
My brother who is a graduate, nothing was going well for him.

0:07:44.240,0:07:46.680
My sister out there was suffering.

0:07:46.680,0:07:48.800
I was also suffering.

0:07:48.800,0:07:51.860
I managed to enter school.

0:07:51.860,0:07:57.160
When I was in school, I moved with friends and went out to clubs

0:07:57.160,0:08:01.280
because the spiritual husband had really tormented me.

0:08:01.280,0:08:03.980
Was this at secondary school or university?

0:08:03.980,0:08:09.820
It was at university.

0:08:09.820,0:08:15.480
My mum was complaining that things were not working well for her.

0:08:15.480,0:08:20.580
What used to happen to you when you were at university?

0:08:20.580,0:08:25.840
When I was at university, I was not living a good life.

0:08:25.840,0:08:28.120
This spirit had really tormented me.

0:08:28.120,0:08:35.660
Each time I was in school, the evil spirit would push me to go out with men for money -

0:08:35.660,0:08:43.560
just to get money to take care of myself and my family because of the predicament in the home.

0:08:43.560,0:08:46.020
We had been suffering.

0:08:46.020,0:08:48.680
What about other members of the family?

0:08:48.680,0:08:58.140
My sister also went out to Malaysia, just to get a means for us to survive.

0:08:58.140,0:09:02.620
But still, she went there and was doing the same thing - prostitution.

0:09:02.620,0:09:05.480
It really affected us.

0:09:05.480,0:09:12.460
My sister called my mum one day and asked her if we had heard of The SCOAN

0:09:12.460,0:09:17.820
that we should come to The SCOAN because she was tired of everything.

0:09:17.820,0:09:22.340
She said she was suffering there and didn't want to live that kind of life anymore.

0:09:22.340,0:09:29.480
That was how we came to The SCOAN and were all delivered last Sunday.

0:09:29.480,0:09:40.000
Tell us - when the Morning Water was being ministered to you, what did you feel at that moment?

0:09:40.000,0:09:43.860
When the Morning Water was ministered to me at that moment,

0:09:43.860,0:09:47.540
I felt something in me trying to come out.

0:09:47.540,0:09:54.280
I felt fire in me; something was burning inside me. I felt heat all over my body.

0:09:54.280,0:10:00.240
That was how I came out, manifested and was delivered.

0:10:00.240,0:10:06.540
Since your deliverance, can you tell us what the changes are that have taken place in your life?

0:10:06.540,0:10:09.720
Since my deliverance, I sleep well.

0:10:09.720,0:10:13.100
I don't have the urge to go out with men anymore.

0:10:13.100,0:10:19.760
I sleep well. I have good dreams. I don't have the urge of going out to sleep with men anymore.

0:10:19.760,0:10:22.140
I am delivered now.

0:10:22.140,0:10:24.480
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:24.480,0:10:28.060
Morning Water Testimony

0:10:28.060,0:10:41.680
Apart from going out with men, what were other attitudes, behaviours and habits you developed then?

0:10:41.680,0:10:50.680
When I was in school, I used to go to clubs, drink with my friends, go to parties and go out with men.

0:10:50.680,0:10:54.320
That was not the kind of life I wanted for myself.

0:10:54.320,0:10:57.900
The spirit in me had really tormented me.

0:10:57.900,0:11:02.900
Since after your deliverance, do you still have the urge to drink alcohol?

0:11:02.900,0:11:10.860
No, I don't have the urge to take alcohol or to go out with men anymore.

0:11:10.860,0:11:13.960
Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:11:40.180,0:11:43.120
Tessy & Family - Edo, Nigeria

0:11:43.120,0:11:45.120
She is my daughter.

0:11:45.120,0:11:47.420
This is my son.

0:11:47.420,0:11:50.680
The other one is my sister's daugther.

0:11:50.680,0:11:56.100
Really, I married an idol worshipper.

0:11:56.100,0:12:03.860
The idol worshipping was fighting against us.

0:12:03.860,0:12:10.240
The spiritual husband was working against me - everything.

0:12:10.240,0:12:12.460
We didn't even know where we were going.

0:12:12.460,0:12:18.420
My daughter travelled to Malaysia for prostitution.

0:12:18.420,0:12:21.860
This of mine who graduated - no work.

0:12:21.860,0:12:24.360
This one was doing her own thing.

0:12:24.360,0:12:32.460
When my daughter called me, she asked me if I knew The SCOAN. I said, "Yes".

0:12:32.460,0:12:33.640
She said that there was a problem.

0:12:33.640,0:12:36.120
I told her my own was a problem -

0:12:36.120,0:12:40.800
that my market had gone down and that I couldn't even see anything to eat in the house.

0:12:40.800,0:12:50.700
Then, my daughter told me that I should be ready to come to The SCOAN.

0:12:50.700,0:12:53.100
I told her I didn't have the transport fare.

0:12:53.100,0:12:56.100
She made a face and brought out money.

0:12:56.100,0:13:02.800
When she brought the money, I struggled to collect the money from her to give people I owed.

0:13:02.800,0:13:08.020
My daughter insisted us coming to the SCOAN.

0:13:08.020,0:13:11.480
That was how we came for deliverance.

0:13:11.480,0:13:17.100
I thank God that my children are delivered and I am delivered, in the name of Jesus.

0:13:17.100,0:13:19.340
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:13:22.980,0:13:27.780
Tell us - since after your deliverance, how has your life and everything else been?

0:13:27.780,0:13:33.540
Since my deliverance, I sleep well and I am very happy.

0:13:33.540,0:13:40.200
I told my son and my daughter that I sleep very well now.

0:13:40.200,0:13:42.780
I am very happy.

0:13:42.780,0:13:47.380
What word of advice do you have for people who are listening to your testimony?

0:13:47.380,0:13:55.160
The advice I want to give people concerning this kind of problem I entered

0:13:55.160,0:14:03.660
with an idol worshipper is that before you give your daughter to any man,

0:14:03.660,0:14:07.780
watch the house and check whether there are any idols there.

0:14:07.780,0:14:13.060
If an idol is there, pray, so that God would deliver you.

0:14:13.060,0:14:15.320

0:14:15.320,0:14:17.100
Ok.

0:14:17.100,0:14:23.460
So that is the advice that we should watch out before we jump!

0:14:23.460,0:14:25.200
We thank God Almighty for everything.

0:14:25.200,0:14:28.180
Now the family is delivered to the glory of God.

0:14:28.180,0:14:30.880
We would like to hear from our brother as well.

0:14:34.200,0:14:35.740
Tell us your name.

0:14:35.740,0:14:38.060
My name is Irabor Frank.

0:14:38.060,0:14:39.900
We are from Edo State.

0:14:39.900,0:14:45.120
This is my mother, my younger sister and my little cousin.

0:14:45.120,0:14:49.300
I thank God that my family is delivered from idol worship.

0:14:49.300,0:14:54.000
I really noticed it in my mum because in those days, if I told her a little thing,

0:14:54.000,0:14:55.460
she would get annoyed.

0:14:55.460,0:15:01.020
After her deliverance on Sunday, we got home. We were just talking.

0:15:01.020,0:15:07.960
There was a word I was using but she didn't even pick on me; she just talked and smiled.

0:15:07.960,0:15:11.400
I said, "Wow! Thank God, we are really delivered!"

0:15:11.400,0:15:13.820
Emmanuel! My family is delivered!

0:15:13.820,0:15:15.440
Amen.

0:15:15.440,0:15:23.020
Tell us how this idol affected your own personal life? What are the challenges you have been facing?

0:15:23.020,0:15:26.040
It had really affected me.

0:15:26.040,0:15:29.580
When I graduated during my NYSC,

0:15:29.580,0:15:36.420
I met some people who said they were going to help me after my NYSC.

0:15:36.420,0:15:47.560
But immediately I finished my NYSC, I misplaced my phone and I didn't see them again.

0:15:47.560,0:15:53.880
The last one I met said that he would see what he could do but up to now - nothing.

0:15:53.880,0:15:56.420
So you mean since you graduated, there's nothing to show for it?

0:15:56.420,0:15:57.400
Nothing.

0:15:57.400,0:16:02.880
Now the family is delivered, your past is over and your breakthrough is restored.

0:16:02.880,0:16:04.180
Amen.

0:16:04.180,0:16:05.680
Let us clap for Jesus!

Finally, can we hear a word of advice from you

0:16:14.940,0:16:19.520
to young ones like yourself and also to parents?

0:16:19.520,0:16:27.100
My advice to my fellow youth is that we should not look at other people on the outside.

0:16:27.100,0:16:31.660
I am dressed like this - seeing me dressed like this, you would feel that I had it all.

0:16:31.660,0:16:36.220
No, I did not have it all; I was burning inside because I could not stop it.

0:16:36.220,0:16:37.980
I thank God that I am delivered.

0:16:37.980,0:16:42.980
If you have the same problem as I had, the only thing I will tell you is for you to run to Christ

0:16:42.980,0:16:46.060
because He is the only One who can save us.

0:16:46.060,0:16:47.200
Amen.

0:16:49.820,0:16:53.080
Indeed, only Jesus Christ can save.

0:16:53.080,0:16:56.800
He is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.

0:16:56.800,0:17:03.240
Now that you and the entire family are delivered, we want to encourage you

0:17:03.240,0:17:08.560
to stay true to our Lord Jesus Christ, make the Word of God the standard for your life and your family

0:17:08.560,0:17:14.200
and embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change.

0:17:14.200,0:17:21.140
As you do so, the breakthrough and blessings of God Almighty will begin to unfold

0:17:21.140,0:17:25.260
and you will come back to testify to this, in Jesus' name.

0:17:25.260,0:17:26.040
Amen.

0:17:26.040,0:17:28.360
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
