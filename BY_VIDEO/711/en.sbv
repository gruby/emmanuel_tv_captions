You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:04.580,0:00:07.000
Hallelujah.

0:00:07.000,0:00:13.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:13.920,0:00:18.260
Wow. I want to salute you.

0:00:18.260,0:00:31.760
Viewers all over the world, I salute your faith.

0:00:31.760,0:00:32.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:32.980,0:00:39.060
Wow. Viewers all over the world, I won't forget what you want me to talk about.

0:00:39.060,0:00:41.320
I can never forget it.

0:00:41.320,0:00:45.600
I can never forget it at all.

0:00:45.600,0:00:47.600
Oh my God!

0:00:47.600,0:00:54.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:54.440,0:00:55.760
Oh my God!

0:00:55.760,0:00:58.740
You know that as your heart is in my heart,

0:00:58.740,0:01:04.800
the same way my heart - it is only you don't permit my heart in your heart.

0:01:04.800,0:01:08.600
Because of your complain now - you keep complaining.

0:01:08.600,0:01:11.040
There are a lot of things going on in your heart.

0:01:11.040,0:01:15.840
Hm, please, he should come and pray for me.

0:01:15.840,0:01:18.180
Don't worry. God is in control.

0:01:18.180,0:01:20.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:20.440,0:01:25.780
Well, last Sunday - how many of you came to the service last Sunday?

0:01:25.780,0:01:29.000
What a controversial service!

0:01:29.000,0:01:31.820
Will I call it like that?

0:01:31.820,0:01:35.760
Very controversial. That is to you.

0:01:35.760,0:01:47.180
The prophecy by itself was not controversial,

0:01:47.180,0:01:56.900
rather you, we - human beings.

0:01:56.900,0:02:02.940
The prophecy by itself was not controversial,

0:02:02.940,0:02:09.740
rather you, we - human beings.

0:02:09.740,0:02:10.720
Tell your neighbour:

0:02:10.720,0:02:23.880
The prophecy by itself was not controversial at all, rather we - human beings.

0:02:23.880,0:02:26.560
That is it.

0:02:26.560,0:02:30.600
It is not my problem; what is controversial there.

0:02:30.600,0:02:40.700
We have seen the outcome of the election in the United States.

0:02:40.700,0:02:58.260
Having seen and heard, you would notice that the prophecy was all about the popular vote -

0:02:58.260,0:03:07.500
the vote of the majority of people - Americans.

0:03:07.500,0:03:25.980
In this case, we need the spirit of a prophet to understand, know and recognise

0:03:25.980,0:03:35.860
what the prophet was talking about.

0:03:35.860,0:03:40.620
You know our levels are different.

0:03:40.620,0:03:42.700
Do you agree with that?

0:03:42.700,0:03:46.820
I said our levels are different.

0:03:46.820,0:03:50.200
We are not on the same level.

0:03:50.200,0:03:59.140
Take not of that: Our levels are different and we are not of the same level.

0:03:59.140,0:04:05.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:05.280,0:04:19.820
That you have a very big cathedral, a huge bell and all kinds of activities

0:04:19.820,0:04:28.420
that are good by human standards,

0:04:28.420,0:04:39.600
remember, the human point of view is limited.

0:04:39.600,0:04:47.500
Let me take you to the Book of 1 Corinthians and see what it says there.

0:04:47.500,0:04:50.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:50.280,0:05:04.120
1 Corinthians 1:25: "For the foolishness of God is wiser than human beings,

0:05:04.120,0:05:11.520
and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."

0:05:11.520,0:05:27.160
That is, the foolishness of God, if there is, is wiser than that of man.

0:05:27.160,0:05:31.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:31.660,0:05:44.860
The weakness of God, if there is, is stronger than that of man.

0:05:44.860,0:05:47.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:47.720,0:06:05.700
There is no shortcut to spiritual maturity

0:06:05.700,0:06:37.180
unless earthly understanding gives way to spiritual enlightenment.

0:06:37.180,0:06:52.040
Many people were trying to interpret Prophet on the basis of their own minds and ideas.

0:06:52.040,0:06:57.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:57.480,0:07:08.120
I quite understand the prophecy actually caused uproar

0:07:08.120,0:07:22.680
to many who gave it a different meaning and interpretation.

0:07:22.680,0:07:26.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:26.180,0:07:57.400
Don't forget that politics, campaigns and elections in any democratic country are never about one person.

0:07:57.400,0:08:07.480
It is about the nation - the country we care for and love.

0:08:07.480,0:08:13.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:13.080,0:08:32.360
It is about the country we care for and love, never about a person, the campaign and election.

0:08:32.360,0:08:42.240
If it is about the nation we care for and love, whatever happens,

0:08:42.240,0:08:54.580
we should accept the outcome and look to the future - Jesus, who is our future,

0:08:54.580,0:08:58.640
the Author and Finisher of our faith.

0:08:58.640,0:09:10.680
Don't forget, democracy is accommodation.

0:09:10.680,0:09:28.900
If democracy is accommodation, all democrats should value the process more than the product.

0:09:28.900,0:09:34.700
Do you know what I mean by process?

0:09:34.700,0:09:48.560
When I say look into the future - the Finisher and Author of our faith, that word is pregnant.

0:09:48.560,0:09:57.060
Who owns the future? - Jesus.

0:09:57.060,0:10:02.020
Jesus owns our future.

0:10:02.020,0:10:12.860
Whatever happens, we should accept it and look to the future.

0:10:12.860,0:10:21.640
Democracy is accommodation; it can accommodate anything.

0:10:21.640,0:10:32.720
You democrats should value the process more than the product.

0:10:32.720,0:10:40.240
I want to say to the nation of the United States, God bless you.

0:10:40.240,0:10:42.540
We will rise up and pray for the nation.

0:10:42.540,0:10:46.320
Whatever happens to that nation happens to the whole world.

0:10:46.320,0:10:54.740
Rise up for prayer.

0:10:54.740,0:11:01.480
Open your lips and ask God for the people of the United States and the world,

0:11:01.480,0:11:11.100
to accept the outcome and look to the future,

0:11:11.100,0:11:16.940
look to God - the Finisher and Author of our faith.

0:11:16.940,0:11:18.640
Prayer.

0:11:26.300,0:11:27.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:27.460,0:11:30.700
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:11:30.700,0:11:39.140
To look to the future is to leave all to God; leave it for God.

0:11:39.140,0:11:46.700
Leave it for God and let's move on.

0:11:46.700,0:11:56.160
Since the logo of the United States is 'In God We Believe' - okay!

0:11:56.160,0:11:59.160
Say, In God We Believe!

0:11:59.160,0:12:07.320
If that is the logo - okay, let's look to God and leave the outcome.

0:12:07.320,0:12:10.460
Look to God and accept the outcome.

0:12:10.460,0:12:13.040
God bless you, United States. Thank you.

0:12:13.040,0:12:14.480
You may be seated.

0:12:14.480,0:12:18.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:18.860,0:12:24.620
If I show you some emails, you will be shocked.

0:12:24.620,0:12:29.320
Can you get me just one of those emails, out of thousands of emails.

0:12:29.320,0:12:31.640
Let them bring it.

0:12:31.640,0:12:34.700
People's faith...

0:12:34.700,0:12:38.100
It is true that in Africa, we have churches everywhere.

0:12:38.100,0:12:42.220
We have churches everywhere; every home is a church.

0:12:42.220,0:12:52.900
But that does not mean that we have more faith than other continents that don't have churches everywhere.

0:12:52.900,0:12:58.380
That we have churches everywhere does not mean that we have faith.

0:12:58.380,0:13:06.420
If I may say something to you: the prophecy I gave here last Sunday -

0:13:06.420,0:13:13.180
thousands of people went for fasting and prayer, telling God and crying.

0:13:13.180,0:13:15.460
I will show you one of their leaders.

0:13:15.460,0:13:20.660
Crying to God that "God, please hear our cry! We want this thing to change!"

0:13:20.660,0:13:28.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:28.340,0:13:33.520
Thousands. They did not hide it - they called and said, "Thank you, Man of God.

0:13:33.520,0:13:35.860
Thank you. You have awoken us.

0:13:35.860,0:13:40.480
We heard your prophecy and immediately, we called each other.

0:13:40.480,0:13:48.660
Thousands or so went to the wilderness to fast and pray - naked - we prayed to God, 'Change this!'"

0:13:48.660,0:13:55.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:55.040,0:13:57.760
You know, I don't want to talk too much. I just leave it.

0:13:57.760,0:14:04.700
You know, what I just told you about, I had just read it.

0:14:04.700,0:14:09.720
I will take one out of the thousand emails I received.

0:14:09.720,0:14:11.720
"Change this!"

0:14:11.720,0:14:17.440
They said, "Thank you. Your prophecy gave us a clue and guideline.

0:14:17.440,0:14:21.060
Change this, Lord! Help us, Lord!"

0:14:21.060,0:14:23.560
Fasting and prayer.

0:14:23.560,0:14:29.880
If I said to my brother here, "Hey, brother!

0:14:29.880,0:14:34.940
Two of you are looking for the position of chairman of the company.

0:14:34.940,0:14:39.820
But I'm seeing you being taken. Indeed, your name is on the table.

0:14:39.820,0:14:45.660
And the time to call you to become a chairman is in the next three days".

0:14:45.660,0:14:51.880
If the person, your second, heard me, maybe he is not in the church here but outside there sitting down,

0:14:51.880,0:14:54.960
maybe he is in another country and sees your face,

0:14:54.960,0:14:59.720
he may naked himself and say, "God, I want this position!

0:14:59.720,0:15:02.800
God, forgive me my sins - whatever I have done!"

0:15:02.800,0:15:06.600
Don't be surprised when he may be taken and you may not be taken.

0:15:06.600,0:15:13.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:13.560,0:15:14.660
I repeat again.

0:15:14.660,0:15:18.480
If two of you are looking for the position of a chairman of a company

0:15:18.480,0:15:24.460
and I call you out and say, "Oh, your paper is on the table now - right now!

0:15:24.460,0:15:26.460
The most qualified!"

0:15:26.460,0:15:29.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:29.700,0:15:37.840
If the person that is also looking for that position is somewhere watching us,

0:15:37.840,0:15:45.580
don't surprised that if the person also has the heart of God,

0:15:45.580,0:15:53.640
he may naked himself that moment and say, "Lord, save this situation!

0:15:53.640,0:15:58.040
I am naked before You. Forgive me whatever I might have done.

0:15:58.040,0:16:00.320
Do it for me, Lord!"

0:16:00.320,0:16:11.000
Don't be surprised if you don't stand steadfast, his prayer may be answered.

0:16:11.000,0:16:16.420
That may not make a prophet a prophet of doom.

0:16:16.420,0:16:18.420
Take note of that.

0:16:18.420,0:16:23.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:23.760,0:16:25.840
Have you found it? Give me.

0:16:25.840,0:16:29.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:29.220,0:16:33.340
This is one out of the cartons.

0:16:33.340,0:16:36.420
Maybe after this, I will ask them to bring all the emails out.

0:16:36.420,0:16:41.440
Not only the emails - their pictures are there.

0:16:41.440,0:16:44.540
It is not a fake email.

0:16:44.540,0:16:47.780
This is one out of thousands of emails.

0:16:47.780,0:16:50.900
I will show you the picture at a distance.

0:16:50.900,0:16:56.540
See the picture.

0:16:56.540,0:16:59.140
Do you see the picture?

0:16:59.140,0:17:03.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:03.960,0:17:10.840
Somebody who can read clearly, can you please help us to read this email

0:17:10.840,0:17:14.060
and you will be able to read it fluently.

0:17:14.060,0:17:17.960
Okay. Don't open the picture. Just read the email.

'America Saved Because Prophet Warned Us!' from Malta

0:17:22.460,0:17:25.480
Thursday, 10 November 2016

0:17:25.480,0:17:27.480
We love you, Prophet.

0:17:27.480,0:17:30.060
Thank you for helping save America.

0:17:30.060,0:17:35.260
Your word sent us into deep prayer, fasting and weeping for America.

0:17:35.260,0:17:40.780
God heard and spared us. Thank you.

0:17:40.780,0:17:46.380
Prophet T.B. Joshua, you were not wrong; it was a strong warning.

0:17:46.380,0:17:52.100
Perhaps it is like Jonah who was to prophesy that Nineveh would be destroyed

0:17:52.100,0:17:54.100
because of their wickedness.

0:17:54.100,0:17:58.120
But the people repented and turned to God and prayed

0:17:58.120,0:18:06.160
and they were spared from the destruction that God had decreed.

0:18:06.160,0:18:08.980
We love you, Prophet.

0:18:08.980,0:18:12.000
Thank you for helping save America.

0:18:12.000,0:18:19.000
Your word sent us into deep prayer, fasting and weeping for America.

0:18:19.000,0:18:22.600
God heard and spared us. Thank you.

0:18:22.600,0:18:28.680
Prophet T.B. Joshua, you were not wrong; it was a strong warning.

0:18:28.680,0:18:37.040
Perhaps it is like Jonah who was to prophesy that Nineveh would be destroyed

0:18:37.040,0:18:39.720
because of their wickedness.

0:18:39.720,0:18:45.500
But the people repented and turned to God and prayed

0:18:45.500,0:18:51.440
and they were spared from the destruction that God had decreed.

0:18:51.440,0:18:57.420
Christians, not only in the U.S. but in the whole world, prayed.

0:18:57.420,0:19:04.140
After hearing your prophecy, we cried, fasted and prayed from Sunday -

0:19:04.140,0:19:12.200
through 5am to Wednesday morning, to assure Trump would win.

0:19:12.200,0:19:19.840
Prophet, God heard our prayers.

0:19:19.840,0:19:25.080
We cried out to God for mercy and grace on America.

0:19:25.080,0:19:31.680
We need His guidance, not even influence. We fasted and prayed...

0:19:31.680,0:19:33.680
Okay, it is alright.

0:19:33.680,0:19:35.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:35.880,0:19:39.700
This is one out of thousands.

0:19:39.700,0:19:43.700
Now, you know I read this thing twice.

0:19:43.700,0:19:46.820
The first one I read, I didn't want to mention it.

0:19:46.820,0:19:50.100
I said the person will win narrowly.

0:19:50.100,0:19:57.320
But the fear I have, which I said, is that the boat will be rocked.

0:19:57.320,0:20:01.020
And I said there will be challenges - great ones.

0:20:01.020,0:20:09.500
To 'rock the boat' means there will be crises.

0:20:09.500,0:20:14.160
Look - I'm just a servant.

0:20:14.160,0:20:18.180
That we will look at what God has written somewhere -

0:20:18.180,0:20:22.580
even sometimes, when God is not there, maybe God is not there,

0:20:22.580,0:20:25.960
you know when your master has written something on a paper,

0:20:25.960,0:20:29.160
and he is not there, maybe he is somewhere,

0:20:29.160,0:20:32.860
we servants sometimes run - "Oh!"

0:20:32.860,0:20:40.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:40.800,0:20:50.260
And the person that has written it is not just a common person - he is a Dr, PhD, Professor and a Pastor.

0:20:50.260,0:20:53.620
He is a professor.

0:20:53.620,0:20:56.120
He is one of the leaders.

0:20:56.120,0:21:06.280
They said that what I saw was true but they were doubting it.

0:21:06.280,0:21:12.200
But they know my antecedent - my track record.

0:21:12.200,0:21:15.780
That when this man says something, it is like that oo! Ah!

Okay, what we were doubting before, this man has said it oo!

0:21:18.980,0:21:21.420
Let's go and die before God!

They said they will write a book - a full book - and send it to me.

0:21:34.540,0:21:36.800
I just laughed.

0:21:36.800,0:21:39.900
This is the power of prayer for you.

Just a servant.

0:21:51.120,0:21:58.040
Is it a crime to tell you what is before you?

0:21:58.040,0:22:05.380
It is not a crime to tell you, "Look, I'm seeing you there".

0:22:05.380,0:22:13.400
It is not a crime; it is a time to say, "Ey!"

0:22:13.400,0:22:17.040
and give your heart...

0:22:17.040,0:22:19.040
It is not a crime.

I remember one time - that was eight years ago.

0:22:27.160,0:22:30.040
I said there is a plane that will be leaving the tarmac.

0:22:30.040,0:22:35.640
I think the head of the aviation then - a very godly man -

0:22:35.640,0:22:38.720
in fact, I had not finished the service when he called.

0:22:38.720,0:22:46.300
He said, "Man of God, where? Is it this place? No plane will move for now till tomorrow".

0:22:46.300,0:22:48.600
I had to draw the mic because they said somebody was on the line.

0:22:48.600,0:22:49.980
I said, "Hello, sir".

0:22:49.980,0:22:52.960
He said, "This tarmac?

0:22:52.960,0:22:56.180
No no no - unless a plane that is coming. No plane will...

0:22:56.180,0:22:57.940
Is it the one coming or the one that will move?"

0:22:57.940,0:22:59.040
I said, "The one that will move".

0:22:59.040,0:23:06.260
He said, "From today till tomorrow afternoon, no plane will move".

0:23:06.260,0:23:11.240
And indeed - that happened just like that and nobody ever knew.

0:23:11.240,0:23:13.920
So, there are some people that have this...
