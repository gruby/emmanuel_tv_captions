Emmanuel!
(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)

0:00:01.360,0:00:02.260
Good morning.

0:00:02.260,0:00:07.160
My name is Amanda, I came from the USA.

0:00:07.160,0:00:16.240
I just want to explain how I was born again through Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:00:16.240,0:00:19.900
It all started when I was really young.

0:00:19.900,0:00:23.480
I loved Jesus, I knew Jesus when I was a really young kid.

0:00:23.480,0:00:31.160
Then, as I got older, around 14, I started having problems in my life, and I started to doubt God,

0:00:31.160,0:00:38.280
I started to think that; "How could there be a God, if all these bad things can happen to me?"

0:00:38.280,0:00:42.040
So, I sort of denounced Jesus as a young child.

0:00:42.040,0:00:46.720
Right after that my problems got worse.

0:00:46.720,0:00:57.680
I started cutting myself with razors, doing drugs, drinking alcohol, rebelling against my parents.

0:00:57.680,0:01:05.060
I just went insane, I was put in mental hospitals all the time.

0:01:05.060,0:01:11.900
In the course of that I became suicidal and I tried to commit suicide all the time.

0:01:11.900,0:01:13.760
Even the doctors would say...

0:01:13.760,0:01:18.600
They would take my blood after I had taken so many drugs in an attempted suicide

0:01:18.600,0:01:23.400
and they would say, "I don't know how you are alive, but you are alive".

0:01:23.400,0:01:27.740
I would just say that I will just try again tomorrow; I was persistent.

0:01:27.740,0:01:37.080
I was always afraid of shooting myself with a gun, because I wanted to go in a much calmer way.

0:01:37.080,0:01:41.460
I also started dealing drugs in the US, like marijuana.

0:01:41.460,0:01:49.480
When I was doing that, along the lines, one day a voice spoke to me and said

0:01:49.480,0:01:52.920
that I would get robbed in this car with these people.

0:01:52.920,0:01:57.820
I didn't understand because this voice speaking to my heart, it felt like God.

0:01:57.820,0:02:07.420
I was like, "I don't believe in God, so how could this be?" but it turned out that I did get robbed.

0:02:07.420,0:02:10.300
I went to a friend's house and I knocked on the door.

0:02:10.300,0:02:16.100
I was like, "If my friend doesn't answer the door, I'm going to jump in front of a car and kill myself".

0:02:16.100,0:02:19.120
But she answered the door and I got home safely.

0:02:19.120,0:02:24.100
I wasn't ready to give my life to God, or to believe in God, or to know God was real;

0:02:24.100,0:02:29.080
I was too busy doing wordly things, so I put it away in my memories,

0:02:29.080,0:02:32.240
I locked it away for another time.

0:02:32.240,0:02:35.320
Then, I got even worse.

0:02:35.320,0:02:39.400
I started to actually think about committing suicide with a gun.

0:02:39.400,0:02:45.880
I remember what happened with the gun, and how a voice spoke to me that might have been God.

0:02:45.880,0:02:50.960
I started to question, "If I died, where would I was going to go?

0:02:50.960,0:02:56.180
Am I going to go to some place like 'no place' or am I going to a place worse than this?"

0:02:56.180,0:03:02.800
So, I just needed to know before I did this act, "Is He real?"

0:03:02.800,0:03:08.300
So, I started seeking on the internet; because when I was younger I experienced demonic attacks.

0:03:08.300,0:03:12.160
It's funny because when I denounced Jesus, the attacks stopped.

0:03:12.160,0:03:17.520
They would attack me at night; they would scare me, and they stopped when I denounced Jesus.

0:03:17.520,0:03:21.220
But I did know that demons were real.

0:03:21.220,0:03:26.840
I went on the internet because I used to play with a satanic things like ouija boards...

0:03:26.840,0:03:32.400
How did you discover Emmanuel TV that led to your deliverance?

0:03:32.400,0:03:35.440
When I was on YouTube, looking to see...

0:03:35.440,0:03:39.420
I wanted to hear demons say that God was real, because even the Bible says that

0:03:39.420,0:03:42.920
demons acknowledge the existence of God.

0:03:42.920,0:03:49.480
The very next thing that came up on Youtube was "Deliverances through Emmanuel TV".

0:03:49.480,0:03:51.820
I was intrigued by it.

0:03:51.820,0:03:55.880
But I always thought, "Maybe this could be fake. Maybe it is not real -

0:03:55.880,0:04:01.200
the healing, the deliverances, the testimonies - it could have all been faked".

0:04:01.200,0:04:07.880
But I kept watching; I ate, slept and breathed this Emmanuel TV, trying to figure it out.

0:04:07.880,0:04:11.640
I saw the good deeds that Prophet T.B. Joshua was doing.

0:04:11.640,0:04:19.640
The love that I saw out of this church - through all my life I've never really seen real love,

0:04:19.640,0:04:22.780
only the love that is temporary or selfish.

0:04:22.780,0:04:28.420
I just started to want to be a part of this, and a part of God.

0:04:28.420,0:04:33.920
What really touched me was the Word of God that Prophet T.B. Joshua teaches -

0:04:33.920,0:04:39.600
the Words of love and hope and who Jesus is.

0:04:39.600,0:04:48.340
Through that I began to change and I started listening and even praying.

0:04:48.340,0:04:52.560
At some point along the way, I found myself in my bathroom, thinking,

0:04:52.560,0:04:56.820
"God, I really want to be a part of this".

0:04:56.820,0:05:01.120
I was just speaking to Jesus, not in a church but in my bathroom,

0:05:01.120,0:05:05.020
"I don't know if You can hear me, I don't know if You are real, but these people seem happy,

0:05:05.020,0:05:07.300
I want to be a part of this."

0:05:07.300,0:05:09.020
I told it myself.

0:05:09.020,0:05:15.440
I was speaking to Him saying, "I'm a bad person; I lie, I steal, I cheat - I'm terrible."

0:05:15.440,0:05:19.920
I was like, "God, I'm just going to fix myself and then I'll come to You."

0:05:19.920,0:05:23.580
But then, at that moment, Jesus spoke to me, and He said to me,

0:05:23.580,0:05:27.360
"No, I will make you perfect" - because it is His work, not mine.

0:05:27.360,0:05:33.340
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:33.340,0:05:37.660
When you started watching Emmanuel TV, your life started changing.

0:05:37.660,0:05:40.460
For the first time you believed God.

0:05:40.460,0:05:41.740
- Right?
- Yes!

0:05:41.740,0:05:47.960
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:47.960,0:05:55.620
My advice for people is, "If you are going through a hard time in life, and you started to doubt God,

0:05:55.620,0:06:06.220
I just want people to know that living life without God is not easier, and He is not your enemy.

0:06:06.220,0:06:10.600
He loves you, He wants good things for you. Jesus loves you."

0:06:10.600,0:06:13.160
That is the most important thing I want people to know;

0:06:13.160,0:06:18.680
it is so much harder in life to be without knowing that love of God.

0:06:18.680,0:06:23.800
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:23.800,0:06:26.880
You mean, you are totally delivered, no more suicidal thoughts,

0:06:26.880,0:06:32.840
and all those demonic spirits that caused you unbelief and all that?

0:06:32.840,0:06:38.800
Yes, when that happened, I felt the spiritual heaviness that was causing all of that,

0:06:38.800,0:06:43.140
to be pushed down into my feet, and I was free to praise God.

0:06:43.140,0:06:46.240
My heart was free; I have never felt so light in all my life.

0:06:46.240,0:06:51.300
From the morning that I woke up, I knew that God was real because He set me free.

0:06:51.300,0:06:52.520
It's amazing!

0:06:52.520,0:06:57.420
Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!

0:06:57.420,0:07:03.640
These are the cuts, scars on my legs from when I used to cut myself and do drugs,

0:07:03.640,0:07:09.500
like I have some on my arm.

0:07:09.500,0:07:14.840
Basically, that's what I would do and that was terrible - I would bleed for days and days.

0:07:14.840,0:07:19.980
I would keep doing it; I would cut myself hundreds of times a day - I liked it.

0:07:19.980,0:07:21.600
It was strange.

0:07:21.600,0:07:22.760
All these are over now?

0:07:22.760,0:07:24.280
Yes, I do not do that.

0:07:24.280,0:07:28.320
Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:07:28.320,0:07:29.520
To God be the glory.

0:07:29.520,0:07:32.940
We thank God Almighty for your life, for this wonderful deliverance you have received

0:07:32.940,0:07:38.280
through watching Emmanuel TV, listening to the message of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:07:38.280,0:07:40.760
Now, that the Lord Almighty has set you free;

0:07:40.760,0:07:44.720
the Bible says those who are delivered by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.

0:07:44.720,0:07:49.900
We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make His Word the standard for your life,

0:07:49.900,0:07:50.600
so that your deliverance will be permanent.
