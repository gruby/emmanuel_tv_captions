0:00:00.020,0:00:06.500
Greetings from Jerusalem, Israel!

0:00:06.500,0:00:08.200
Thank you.

0:00:08.200,0:00:10.380
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:00:10.380,0:00:20.700
The purpose and the reason why I paid such a visit to the mayor of Jerusalem was

0:00:20.700,0:00:29.600
for the important pilgrimage for the viewers and lovers of Emmanuel TV all over the world.

0:00:29.600,0:00:38.300
I want that kind of pilgrimage so you can visit places you have read so much about in the bible.

0:00:38.300,0:00:43.000
This is why I visited the mayor of Jerusalem.

0:00:43.000,0:00:48.600
and other officials of Parliament and other;

0:00:48.600,0:00:54.200
to let them know that my people are 
coming from all over the world,

0:00:54.200,0:01:02.400
to pay a visit to the most important places you have read so much about.

0:01:02.400,0:01:10.700
And there are many places there that some of the pilgrimages may not have the grace to visit.

0:01:10.700,0:01:17.100
When I was there there are some places they took me to. People don't go there because of security.

0:01:17.100,0:01:22.700
Like Abraham and Sarah sites and many other places like that.

0:01:22.700,0:01:27.200
You will not see any pilgrimage there. While millions of pilgrimages are going everywhere.

0:01:27.200,0:01:31.700
I want those places for you. I want them to add that one when you are going.

0:01:31.700,0:01:37.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:37.000,0:01:52.800
So, this is very important. And also make an arrangement with a tour guide to take you all over Israel.

0:01:52.800,0:01:55.800
Also schedule a meeting with the authority.

0:01:55.800,0:02:03.400
So you will be recognized as a priesthood.

0:02:03.400,0:02:10.400
Not just a pilgrimage, but someone they should honor and respect when you visit them.

0:02:10.400,0:02:17.200
I love you so much. This is why I paid such a visit to Jerusalem's mayor.

0:02:17.200,0:02:21.000
I know many of you have visited many places in Israel.

0:02:21.000,0:02:27.900
There are many places you have actually never visited.

0:02:27.900,0:02:35.900
You have visited Israel many times, but there are some places you would be willing to visit.

0:02:35.900,0:02:38.660
So, I think that this time is an opportunity.

0:02:38.660,0:02:47.300
When it is time I will let you know. And it will be a quota system for each country,

0:02:47.300,0:02:52.500
Emmanuel TV viewers are all over the world.

0:02:52.500,0:02:54.100
They want to visit.

0:02:54.100,0:03:01.400
Once they are there for six days, on the seventh day I can flight there to meet and pray with them.

0:03:01.400,0:03:06.940
so that by then you would have visited everywhere.

0:03:06.940,0:03:10.400
I will be there just one or two days.

0:03:10.400,0:03:14.600
Pray with you in any location the Spirit of God directs.

0:03:14.600,0:03:18.700
Then congratulate you and come back home.

0:03:18.700,0:03:20.840
Hallelujah!

0:03:20.840,0:03:23.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:23.400,0:03:31.300
Try to meet some tour guide that will be taking people around.

0:03:31.300,0:03:35.200
So during the testimonies the Spirit of God reminded me and said:

0:03:35.200,0:03:41.100
"talk to your people about LET LOVE LEAD." So that they will know so much about it.

0:03:41.100,0:03:43.800
We have been talking about this issue of love

0:03:43.800,0:03:47.500
because faith cannot work without love.

0:03:47.500,0:03:53.100
Let's just quickly look at a force called love.

0:03:53.100,0:03:56.300
Let me take you to the Book of 1 John

0:03:56.300,0:04:01.600
1 John chapter 4

0:04:01.600,0:04:06.300
God's love and ours.

0:04:06.300,0:04:08.600
Take note of the title there.

0:04:08.600,0:04:11.000
Verse 7.

0:04:11.000,0:04:14.100
1 John chapter 4 verse 7

0:04:14.100,0:04:18.200
The title is "God's love and ours".

0:04:18.200,0:04:23.800
This means there are two kinds of love: God's love and ours.

0:04:23.800,0:04:27.100
Ok. I'll read verse 7.

0:04:27.100,0:04:35.900
"Dear Friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God."

0:04:35.900,0:04:43.000
Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

0:04:43.000,0:04:49.100
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.

0:04:49.100,0:04:51.120
Hallelujah!

0:04:51.120,0:04:56.500
This is how God showed his love among his people.

0:04:56.500,0:05:06.300
He sent his one and only son to the world that we might live through him.

0:05:06.300,0:05:13.400
Let's go to the Book of 1 Corinthians

0:05:13.400,0:05:19.100
Chapter 13 verse 13.

0:05:19.100,0:05:22.700
1 Corinthians Chapter 13 verse 13.

0:05:22.700,0:05:33.300
"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

0:05:33.300,0:05:36.900
So we say LET LOVE LEAD.

0:05:36.900,0:05:42.700
What does that mean in that 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 verse 13?

0:05:42.700,0:05:47.500
It says love is the greatest.

0:05:47.500,0:05:52.700
If love is the greatest, what else again?

0:05:52.700,0:06:04.000
If love is the greatest, this means that without love, nothing can work. You cannot work without love.

0:06:04.000,0:06:06.400
Your attitude cannot work.

0:06:06.400,0:06:13.600
If you are kind, very good, or just mention any attribute you claim you have.

0:06:13.600,0:06:16.700
Without love that cannot work.

0:06:16.700,0:06:23.800
It means if you laugh without love, you are laughing, not God.

0:06:23.800,0:06:26.920
But you can laugh and God laughs.

0:06:26.920,0:06:29.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:29.300,0:06:39.900
When we laugh in love and faith, God laughs.

0:06:39.900,0:06:49.200
When you pray in love and faith, God prays.

0:06:49.200,0:06:53.700
So you say you are the one praying; no it's God

0:06:53.700,0:07:04.000
When you preach in love and faith, God preaches.

0:07:04.000,0:07:08.100
So, in that 1 John 4:7

0:07:08.100,0:07:21.500
It says, "beloved, let us love for love is God and God is love."

0:07:21.500,0:07:40.800
Everyone who loves is born of God for love is God and God is love.

0:07:40.800,0:07:44.100
Can you see the position of God when I say LET LOVE LEAD?

0:07:44.100,0:07:47.900
You say, how can love lead? Yes it can.

0:07:47.900,0:08:03.900
If you fail to walk in love, you almost shut down your spiritual walk with the Lord.

0:08:03.900,0:08:15.200
Failure to walk in love can almost shut down our spiritual walk with the Lord.

0:08:15.200,0:08:22.900
It can shut down your relationship with God. Failure to walk in love.

0:08:22.900,0:08:29.800
When I say LET LOVE LEAD, you should understand what I am talking about.

0:08:29.800,0:08:41.100
Love is the force that sets everything working.

0:08:41.100,0:08:52.100
Your kindness, goodness, humility, faith or just mention any quality you can talk about.

0:08:52.100,0:09:00.400
Love is the force that sets them working.

0:09:00.400,0:09:18.100
Without love, your kindness, goodness, faithfulness and obedience will be dormant.

0:09:18.100,0:09:21.700
When you say, [laugh] without love,

0:09:21.700,0:09:24.900
you are laughing of yourself.

0:09:24.900,0:09:29.100
[laugh] with love, you are laughing with God.

0:09:29.100,0:09:45.800
Love looks around to see who is in need. Tell your neighbor [...].

0:09:45.800,0:09:55.100
Love looks around to see who is in need.

0:09:55.100,0:10:06.200
Love looks around to see who is unsaved.

0:10:06.200,0:10:07.900
You have love.

0:10:07.900,0:10:10.200
The love of God.

0:10:10.200,0:10:16.400
Love looks around. As you are sitting, you look around you.

0:10:16.400,0:10:21.800
Who is sick? What can you do to help?

0:10:21.800,0:10:25.200
What assistance can you give?

0:10:25.200,0:10:30.200
You begin to think about that because you are born of love.

0:10:30.200,0:10:35.300
You begin to think about this man sitting behind me,

0:10:35.300,0:10:37.740
the way I am looking at him is not comfortable.

0:10:37.740,0:10:41.700
You may because of the man move toward the usher.

0:10:41.700,0:10:45.900
And say usher, can I see you please?

0:10:45.900,0:10:54.000
There is a man behind me. It looks like it will need help and I don't know how to go about it.

0:10:54.000,0:10:58.800
Would you please approach (talk to) him?

0:10:58.800,0:11:04.600
When you look around you, you will see those who are in need of what you have.

0:11:04.600,0:11:07.900
Maybe he does not have anything, no money to buy food.

0:11:07.900,0:11:11.000
He even had to borrow money to come here.

0:11:11.000,0:11:15.500
You can now on your own, "excuse me". "How are you?", "fine".

0:11:15.500,0:11:23.500
Would you mind to see me? "Yes." He would not mind to see you.

0:11:23.500,0:11:28.600
But for your own love, one must meet you and say "Uncle I need your help".

0:11:28.600,0:11:30.760
That is your (way of expressing) love.

0:11:30.760,0:11:35.400
"Uncle I need your help." I have not eaten today.

0:11:35.400,0:11:40.400
"Please help me." You will now bring money out. That is your own (way of expressing) love.

0:11:40.400,0:11:44.600
Which is not God's love.

0:11:44.600,0:11:51.800
This is why the title here says, "God's love and ours"

0:11:51.800,0:11:54.900
Your own (way of expressing) love: if they do not ask you, you will not give.

0:11:54.900,0:12:03.100
If they person is not falling [sound of need], you will not help.

0:12:03.100,0:12:11.900
You always help for selfish, classic, and material reasons. For reasons known to you you help.

0:12:11.900,0:12:24.000
Love looks around to see who is in need, crying, lamenting. People you can see.

0:12:24.000,0:12:30.700
If you have that love, God will give you his face and his eyes to see them.

0:12:30.700,0:12:38.400
No matter how little or how poor you are,

0:12:38.400,0:12:44.000
There are many people that are still in need of what you have;

0:12:44.000,0:12:46.800
People you are better than.

0:12:46.800,0:12:55.800
When you say you don't have anything, OK. There could be something that is better than anything.

0:12:55.800,0:13:02.300
Something can be better than anything, but your language is always; "I don't have anything."

0:13:02.300,0:13:05.200
Take this word:

0:13:05.200,0:13:19.900
The world needs to see our unity and our love for one another.

0:13:19.900,0:13:41.000
If we have God's love, tell your neighbor; the world needs to see our unity and our love for one another.

0:13:41.000,0:13:58.400
Yes, if you have God's love; the world will see our unity and our love for one another.

0:13:58.400,0:14:05.400
But we fight ourselves. If you know you cannot join bare fighting you just remain quiet.

0:14:05.400,0:14:11.100
This is why I remain quiet because you will not be able to quote me.

0:14:11.100,0:14:20.500
If I want to be your friend and I know you are not ready to be my friend, you remain quiet.

0:14:20.500,0:14:28.700
I am not isolated but I decided to be quiet because which direction will I follow?

0:14:28.700,0:14:33.200
Yes, that does not stop me; that is my nature.

0:14:33.200,0:14:41.000
I will not live by history, I will live according to God's what?

0:14:41.000,0:14:44.300
God's direction.

0:14:44.300,0:14:53.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:53.000,0:14:57.000
I will live according to God's direction.

0:14:57.000,0:15:02.300
Just like the last time I traveled when I traveled to Israel,

0:15:02.300,0:15:06.200
I said OK, I must pay a visit to Bethlehem.

0:15:06.200,0:15:12.300
When I entered Bethlehem, I said "no" I will not enter Bethlehem without seeing the mayor of Bethlehem.

0:15:12.300,0:15:14.800
It is not possible for me.

0:15:14.800,0:15:19.500
If I am not going to see the mayor of Bethlehem, I will not go to Bethlehem.

0:15:19.500,0:15:23.000
People were saying, "mayor of Bethlehem?"

0:15:23.000,0:15:30.500
Who is this man? Then, I introduced myself. I am T.B. Joshua.

0:15:30.500,0:15:38.600
Before I know it they quickly searched the Internet, "250 million follow this man all over the world".

0:15:38.600,0:15:48.000
Anywhere/whoever you want to visit, we are ready to take you there. They are not like us here.

0:15:48.000,0:15:56.200
They respect people integrity and reputation.

0:15:56.200,0:16:04.700
You know, the Internet is a global thing. If you say you are somebody, they will type your name; simple!

0:16:04.700,0:16:10.700
They give a call, "so and so person", "what is name?" T.B. Joshua?

0:16:10.700,0:16:14.500
Just T.B. Joshua without going to the Internet,

0:16:14.500,0:16:23.060
the mayor said, "please, I am going to leave everything I am doing I want to see the man."

0:16:23.060,0:16:27.300
"Please let him come." As I came he said, "how are you?" I said, "fine."

0:16:27.300,0:16:33.300
We discussed... "I am here in your city Bethlehem."

0:16:33.300,0:16:35.980
Since you are the governor and everything here,

0:16:35.980,0:16:38.820
before I enter the city I said, "let me say hello to you."

0:16:38.820,0:16:44.860
He entertained me and gave me an award and we discussed...

0:16:44.860,0:16:50.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:50.600,0:16:55.500
So from there they appointed a tour guide.

0:16:55.500,0:17:00.300
Sir, where or anywhere you want to go this tour guide will take you around.

0:17:00.300,0:17:07.200
I said, "OK, but I still want to come back and see you mayor." he said, "OK".

0:17:07.200,0:17:17.700
Moving around, they took me to one hospital we passed to the place we were going to see;

0:17:17.700,0:17:21.000
and I saw sick people everywhere.

0:17:21.000,0:17:24.800
People were saying [sick sound]

0:17:24.800,0:17:28.300
You know I am not used to see people in pain.

0:17:28.300,0:17:34.300
Even when I am praying for people here, and I see people in pain; I will turn my back and stretch my hand.

0:17:34.300,0:17:37.700
When I see the pain, I feel it myself.

0:17:37.700,0:17:40.700
I said Lord, Lord, I will not be able to pass this hospital.

0:17:40.700,0:17:43.100
Where are we going?

0:17:43.100,0:17:51.460
We now approached the chief medical director there.

0:17:51.460,0:17:53.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:53.300,0:18:02.700
He said, "many of these people don't have machines for dialysis and they are so many". I said, "OK".

0:18:02.700,0:18:09.800
I said, "look, I am going back. I am not going to be able to go far. Let me go back, I am going to see mayor".

0:18:09.800,0:18:15.100
They said, "let us move forward", I said, "no, no I am going to see mayor".

0:18:15.100,0:18:20.300
When I got to mayor, they asked, "have you finished moving around?" I said, "no, no I can't move around".

0:18:20.300,0:18:28.500
I saw people on sick beds, they said there are no machines for dialysis...

0:18:28.500,0:18:33.400
What can we do to support? These people should not die just like that.

0:18:33.400,0:18:39.400
The mayor now gives a call to the chief medical director.

0:18:39.400,0:18:43.100
"What are the challenges about dialysis machines?"

0:18:43.100,0:18:47.640
They said they need almost 20 to 30 dialysis machines.

0:18:47.640,0:18:51.240
I said, "right now I am going to provide them."

0:18:51.240,0:18:59.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:59.200,0:19:07.500
We have provided the machines for them as I am talking now, they are with them.

0:19:07.500,0:19:15.000
We provided the machines, dialysis machines. We provided all for them.

0:19:15.000,0:19:19.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:19.100,0:19:25.000
And the woman mayor said, [surprise sound]

0:19:25.000,0:19:27.600
Yes!

0:19:27.600,0:19:31.200
Yes!

0:19:31.200,0:19:33.920
Don't call me by my name Prophet,

0:19:33.920,0:19:36.100
call me LOVE.

0:19:36.100,0:19:38.700
My name is LOVE.

0:19:38.700,0:19:43.200
LET LOVE LEAD

0:19:43.200,0:19:48.700
You are the one who calls me prophet, pastor, bishop whatever name you call me

0:19:48.700,0:19:59.700
That is the name you gave me. But the name God gave me from heaven is LOVE.

0:19:59.700,0:20:01.400
Are you with me?

0:20:01.400,0:20:06.580
You call me bishop, prophet, general overseer of the Synagogue whatever name,

0:20:06.580,0:20:09.900
I will answer you because I don't want to hurt you

0:20:09.900,0:20:13.600
You say, "Papa",...huuhuu

0:20:13.600,0:20:19.500
How can you see [Running Standing Still]

0:20:19.500,0:20:24.200
Can you Papa at home do like this? [Running Standing Still]

0:20:24.200,0:20:27.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:27.500,0:20:32.000
When you see me like this and call me Papa God will forgive you.

0:20:32.000,0:20:41.600
You cannot be Papa twice only once. Young once, old once, brother once, sister once, once you are sister;

0:20:41.600,0:20:45.000
as time goes on they will not call you sister again.

0:20:45.000,0:20:47.560
Wait for the when I will be Papa.

0:20:47.560,0:20:50.200
LET LOVE LEAD

0:20:50.200,0:20:55.600
Let someone say let love lead.

0:20:55.600,0:20:59.000
We are all one.

0:20:59.000,0:21:05.300
Whatever you can do to change the world, whatever; change the world.

0:21:05.300,0:21:09.100
Don't begin to hide under Jesus Christ.

0:21:09.100,0:21:11.500
Don't hide under Christianity.

0:21:11.500,0:21:16.200
Don't hide under the name bishop, the name prophet.

0:21:16.200,0:21:19.400
Change and help!

0:21:19.400,0:21:23.300
Save souls.

0:21:23.300,0:21:27.640
I know many of us will, "Ha, we have many hospitals in Nigeria,

0:21:27.640,0:21:31.600
that are in need of dialysis machines."

0:21:31.600,0:21:37.800
But what about our name that has been spoiled all over the world? How do we repair this name?

0:21:37.800,0:21:41.140
That name Nigeria where I travel all over,

0:21:41.140,0:21:44.600
they look at Nigeria differently, they say, "no, no, no this one is from Nigeria? No.

0:21:44.600,0:21:50.000
What you are saying about Nigeria is quite different".

0:21:50.000,0:21:52.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:52.900,0:21:57.900
You that can do the one at home, continue doing it. We that can do the one outside,

0:21:57.900,0:22:02.000
the name that has been spoiled outside, let us go and repair that name.

0:22:02.000,0:22:12.000
The belief is that Africans are only to ask anywhere we enter: give me, give me, give me...

0:22:12.000,0:22:16.000
That is the impression of people outside the world.

0:22:16.000,0:22:19.840
No matter how rich an African man...

0:22:19.840,0:22:22.600
It is always: give me, give me, give me...

0:22:22.600,0:22:24.980
No we should change this impression.

0:22:24.980,0:22:27.700
We too can give.

0:22:27.700,0:22:32.000
We can give out of the little we have. Let's give, let's begin to give.

0:22:32.000,0:22:36.600
You say you are poor. Who told you are poor?

0:22:36.600,0:22:40.600
Your parents told you you are poor. But God does not say that you are poor.

0:22:40.600,0:22:44.200
Give!

0:22:44.200,0:22:48.700
Let them know that, no; the time of "give us, give us is over."

0:22:48.700,0:22:52.200
It is also the time we can give them and they too give us.

0:22:52.200,0:22:56.900
Give us, give us...Let us give, let us exchange.

0:22:56.900,0:23:00.560
The western world over the world are human beings like us.

0:23:00.560,0:23:04.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:04.700,0:23:12.000
It is not that I have so much. But I just feel that out of the little I have I can give.

0:23:12.000,0:23:17.000
To change some impression we found

0:23:17.000,0:23:22.300
when we were little. But for the generation of yesterday and the generation of today,

0:23:22.300,0:23:26.180
the impression we create outside the world is very very bad.

0:23:26.180,0:23:28.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:28.100,0:23:37.300
We are not doing it to show off, no. It is a way of letting love lead.

0:23:37.300,0:23:40.000
LET LOVE LEAD.

0:23:40.000,0:23:47.700
Like I have said. A lot of things are going on all over the world, all over the world.

0:23:47.700,0:23:54.900
In Africa, there are problems. We are the ones destroying our continent.

0:23:54.900,0:23:59.700
We use our mouth to destroy our continent.

0:23:59.700,0:24:07.400
We don't appreciate our people.

0:24:07.400,0:24:10.880
I mean we don't appreciate our people.

0:24:10.880,0:24:16.000
After meeting the mayor I was taken to the parliament.

0:24:16.000,0:24:25.100
While sitting, I looked at myself and I remembered my Africa and I said, Oh! I nearly cried and I said, Africa!

0:24:25.100,0:24:28.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:28.500,0:24:34.900
I was talking about universities last time and African universities all over.

0:24:34.900,0:24:39.900
Can you believe that I am invited to an American university?

0:24:39.900,0:24:46.000
One of the biggest university to come and give a lecture.

0:24:46.000,0:24:49.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:49.500,0:24:54.900
I am invited in Alabama and in many other states to come and give lectures.

0:24:54.900,0:25:00.260
The students say, "yes we want this man to come and speak to us".

0:25:00.260,0:25:03.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:03.600,0:25:09.200
These are the big universities and I am still in between asking God

0:25:09.200,0:25:11.500
Should I go or not go?

0:25:11.500,0:25:22.000
I know if I just visit one, all over the world I will be receiving invitations to give lectures at universities.

0:25:22.000,0:25:24.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:24.400,0:25:32.100
I pray the Lord will give me an opportunity to visit some of these universities.

0:25:32.100,0:25:38.400
I have my area of specialization I am going to talk about. I am not a professor.

0:25:38.400,0:25:48.200
But I will talk about an area where they would appreciate God better.

0:25:48.200,0:26:05.000
Education is not success, it is to help us succeed.

0:26:05.000,0:26:11.000
It is not that success, but it helps us succeed.

0:26:11.000,0:26:20.000
That is why you can be a criminal or anything and still graduate first class.

0:26:20.000,0:26:25.600
You can be one of the cult members in the school,

0:26:25.600,0:26:31.600
You can be a criminal or a tug, this is why we find it difficult to understand our children.

0:26:31.600,0:26:36.300
We love them because they are very brilliant, but we don't know that some of them are criminals.

0:26:36.300,0:26:42.000
They are very brilliant but at the same time they are criminals.

0:26:42.000,0:26:44.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:44.400,0:26:46.520
Why should this be?

0:26:46.520,0:26:52.500
If you are very brilliant, you should not be a criminal.

0:26:52.500,0:27:00.000
Why should you be a criminal and the best student in the school?

0:27:00.000,0:27:01.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:01.900,0:27:07.100
A tug and the best student in the school, first class.

0:27:07.100,0:27:10.000
Why these two things should go together?

0:27:10.000,0:27:13.500
This is where children of God get confused.

0:27:13.500,0:27:18.300
You say, I read, read, I read, look at me, third class.

0:27:18.300,0:27:23.800
And this guy I know him to be very wayward in the school.

0:27:23.800,0:27:27.700
He is a member of a cult and is first class.

0:27:27.700,0:27:29.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:29.200,0:27:34.720
So, this is why children of God get confused.

0:27:34.720,0:27:41.500
You say, I read, I read all the time, I read my book all the time, I pray, I fast,

0:27:41.500,0:27:47.800
I meet my pastor for prayer and other but at the end I came third class.

0:27:47.800,0:27:58.000
But I know this student very wayward, he never believes God. He always goes to parties, night clubs;

0:27:58.000,0:28:03.400
and I don't know when he or she reads but now first class.

0:28:03.400,0:28:07.900
This is an area where students need someone to come and talk to them.

0:28:07.900,0:28:16.100
Why things should happen like that so that they will not get confused that God is unfaithful.

0:28:16.100,0:28:18.900
Students need to understand this...

0:28:18.900,0:28:25.600
If you have prayed and you have been walking in the Lord, in the love;

0:28:25.600,0:28:29.200
and you have been doing the right thing and you know that you are a believer.

0:28:29.200,0:28:35.100
And at the end of the day you came third class, give thank to God;

0:28:35.100,0:28:48.000
because your third class will give you a better future than first class.

0:28:48.000,0:28:49.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:49.400,0:29:02.700
That is why today when you look at the record of heroes, generals; people that are there (up) today

0:29:02.700,0:29:09.780
90% of them came third class.

0:29:09.780,0:29:11.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:11.520,0:29:16.200
Even the lowest third class.

0:29:16.200,0:29:19.300
Even failure.

0:29:19.300,0:29:23.300
But today they are the heroes.

0:29:23.300,0:29:35.000
Whereas 80% of people on the street that will say I am a graduate are first class.

0:29:35.000,0:29:36.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:36.320,0:29:40.500
80% that are on the street looking for jobs or

0:29:40.500,0:29:47.700
doing what they have not been prayed to do, what they are not planning or they do not like to do;

0:29:47.700,0:29:52.180
80% of them are first class.

0:29:52.180,0:29:53.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:53.700,0:30:00.500
It is not about what you come out with. It is the force behind what you come out with.

0:30:00.500,0:30:05.900
I can have $5 and you have $10,000

0:30:05.900,0:30:12.900
And my $5 will be more valuable than your $10,000.

0:30:12.900,0:30:15.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:15.200,0:30:18.500
I repeat again.

0:30:18.500,0:30:31.500
I may have $10,000 and you have $1,000,000. My $10,000 will be more valuable than your $1,000,000.

0:30:31.500,0:30:35.200
It depends on how we came up with the money: the processing.

0:30:35.200,0:30:37.500
It is process that works.

0:30:37.500,0:30:39.900
What works? [process]

0:30:39.900,0:30:43.000
I can't hear you [process]

0:30:43.000,0:30:45.140
Look at marriages today.

0:30:45.140,0:30:51.680
Many marriages that the whole world celebrate with gifts of billions of dollars,

0:30:51.680,0:30:55.800
90% of such marriages are broken today.

0:30:55.800,0:31:08.000
Whereas some marriages nobody knew about are the ones still there as husband and wife.

0:31:08.000,0:31:14.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:14.100,0:31:28.700
Process, let someone say process [process]. If your process to acquire first class is not Godly,

0:31:28.700,0:31:32.100
but you are very brilliant and you have not lived a Godly life;

0:31:32.100,0:31:36.300
and someone whose process is Godly

0:31:36.300,0:31:45.300
and later came out third class, lowest, or even failure or pass.

0:31:45.300,0:31:52.400
He will achieve what we call greatness in the future than you that have the first class.

0:31:52.400,0:31:55.500
It is a matter of time.

0:31:55.500,0:31:57.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:57.500,0:32:00.300
You people are out there you have many histories.

0:32:00.300,0:32:04.100
Look at all this Facebook we are talking about. The founder of Facebook.

0:32:04.100,0:32:11.600
You go and read about him that young man. He abandoned university.

0:32:11.600,0:32:15.300
So, the question is about process.

0:32:15.300,0:32:17.500
The process of your marriage.

0:32:17.500,0:32:20.600
The process of being a pastor.

0:32:20.600,0:32:22.900
The process of being a prophet.

0:32:22.900,0:32:26.000
The process of being president of a country.

0:32:26.000,0:32:29.100
The process of being a senator of a country.

0:32:29.100,0:32:32.300
The process of being head of a department.

0:32:32.300,0:32:39.700
That process will continue to work for you, work against you, work for you.

0:32:39.700,0:32:44.700
How do you become the Managing Director of the company?

0:32:44.700,0:32:50.400
You are a Managing Director. You know you run to witch doctors

0:32:50.400,0:32:54.700
to make sure that the former Managing Director is dismissed.

0:32:54.700,0:33:00.100
The result does not matter; process matters.

0:33:00.100,0:33:06.800
Your results may be bad but your process is good. It is a matter of time; fold your hand.

0:33:06.800,0:33:12.080
[Clapping]

0:33:12.080,0:33:13.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:13.960,0:33:19.100
You may be dismissed unlovely and someone is asked to take your position.

0:33:19.100,0:33:24.000
It is a matter of time; fold your hand.

0:33:24.000,0:33:25.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:25.600,0:33:29.700
So, all this is life.

0:33:29.700,0:33:32.700
This is why you see people like me here today.

0:33:32.700,0:33:36.300
It is because of process that I am still alive.

0:33:36.300,0:33:42.500
It is not because of results. It is not because of what is happening, miracles, this or that...

0:33:42.500,0:33:47.000
That is not the reason why I am still alive and got stronger.

0:33:47.000,0:33:52.600
It is because of process. I quietly follow the process of the Lord.

0:33:52.600,0:33:57.600
I know the Lord will be there for me. [Amen, Clapping]

0:33:57.600,0:34:00.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:00.020,0:34:03.600
That is process.

0:34:03.600,0:34:05.100
Process!

0:34:05.100,0:34:12.900
If you dupe your fellow brother to get a billion dollars and become a millionaire; it is not yet over.

0:34:12.900,0:34:18.700
Process, let someone say process. It is not yet over.

0:34:18.700,0:34:23.600
It is not yet over; it is a matter of time. You, you will still crumble from there.

0:34:23.600,0:34:26.600
And you will be on the street begging.

0:34:26.600,0:34:30.100
Let someone say process.

0:34:30.100,0:34:34.000
So that is why for many of you, any time there is trouble,

0:34:34.000,0:34:40.700
somebody duped you, somebody tried to do something against you, you are so bitter. Don't be bitter.

0:34:40.700,0:34:45.200
Keep holding on to God. No one can cheat you and go.

0:34:45.200,0:34:47.600
It is a matter of time.

0:34:47.600,0:35:01.600
If somebody takes something that belongs to you, it takes it away and is using it; it is a matter of time.

0:35:01.600,0:35:03.000
Process.

0:35:03.000,0:35:09.900
So the problem many of you are facing today is as a result of the wrong process

0:35:09.900,0:35:13.300
because you want to follow shortcuts.

0:35:13.300,0:35:18.900
It is a normal thing that 1 + 1 + 1 is equal to 3.

0:35:18.900,0:35:23.600
But you want to say 1 + 2.

0:35:23.600,0:35:25.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:25.400,0:35:34.700
If I am talking to you (you understand) that the normal process to get 3 is 1 + 1 + 1 is equal to what? [3]

0:35:34.700,0:35:42.300
But in your own case because you are impatient; it is 1 + 2.

0:35:42.300,0:35:49.200
That 2 you don't want to simplify it or break it at all; you want to have 3 immediately.

0:35:49.200,0:35:55.000
If it was possible you would say 3 is equal to 3.

0:35:55.000,0:35:56.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:56.720,0:36:04.600
It is not too late; you can start afresh because God loves you so much.

0:36:04.600,0:36:11.200
If you have taken a wrong process; start afresh.

0:36:11.200,0:36:20.200
If it is a wrong process you have followed and you are getting and enjoying it [hummm...]

0:36:20.200,0:36:24.000
A time is coming.

0:36:24.000,0:36:29.000
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:36:29.000,0:36:38.700
So please work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.

0:36:38.700,0:36:41.700
Say it again!

0:36:41.700,0:36:42.500
Again!

0:36:42.500,0:36:47.400
[Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.]

0:36:47.400,0:36:48.500
I can't hear you!

0:36:48.500,0:36:53.500
[Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.]

While you are praying to God...

We don't know how to pray. 
The Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness.

Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything...

0:37:18.500,0:37:25.200
Tell your children at home: Read as if everything depends on you pray as if everything depends on God.

0:37:25.200,0:37:28.300
Tell it to your children. So please.
