0:00:00.000,0:00:02.620
Jesus' name must be honoured.

0:00:02.620,0:00:04.340
(Amen!)

0:00:04.340,0:00:06.860
Thank you. 
Thank You, Lord.

0:00:06.860,0:00:11.520
You listen to the message, "Jesus' name must be honoured".

0:00:11.520,0:00:15.680
For Jesus' name to be honoured.

0:00:15.680,0:00:23.020
That is the question, "How can Jesus' name be honoured?"

0:00:23.020,0:00:29.080
John asked me to call you - you refuse to answer - that is not honour.

0:00:29.080,0:00:37.700
You say, "John, John!" - and John refuses to hear you, or you refuse to hear John - that is not honour.

0:00:37.700,0:00:45.740
You say, "John, John!" - no response - that is not honour.

0:00:45.740,0:00:52.880
For Jesus' name to be honoured - is a "million dollars" question.

0:00:52.880,0:01:00.240
"Kinsly, Kinsly!" - no response.

0:01:00.240,0:01:04.400
For Jesus' name to be honoured.

0:01:04.400,0:01:08.660
That is a question for everyone of us.

0:01:08.660,0:01:15.500
The question is, 'Is Jesus' name being honoured?'

0:01:15.500,0:01:23.860
Viewers, we know you are there and we can feel it.

0:01:23.860,0:01:28.060
You are with us and we are with you.

0:01:28.060,0:01:34.000
Distance is not a barrier and your Bible is there with you.

0:01:34.000,0:01:38.480
Let's quickly look at the Book of John 6, verse 63.

0:01:38.480,0:01:48.580
Viewers, going by the song we've just sung now, "Jesus' name must be honoured.

0:01:48.580,0:01:53.580
Jesus' name must be honoured in my life everyday."

0:01:53.580,0:01:58.940
Is this being honoured in your life?

0:01:58.940,0:02:01.100
That is the question.

0:02:01.100,0:02:11.720
John 6:63 says, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.

0:02:11.720,0:02:22.180
The Words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life."

0:02:22.180,0:02:26.100
And you know that Christ and the Word are one.

0:02:26.100,0:02:35.860
Here in John 6:63 it says, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.

0:02:35.860,0:02:43.540
The Words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life."

0:02:43.540,0:02:56.120
Go also down, to the verse 65, "He went on to say, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to Me

0:02:56.120,0:03:01.600
unless the Father has enabled them.'"

0:03:01.600,0:03:09.920
You can't just wake up and say, "I'm going to Jesus" - you must be enabled.

0:03:09.920,0:03:16.680
This means you must be enabled and energised.

0:03:16.680,0:03:20.820
You can't just say, "I'm a child of God."

0:03:20.820,0:03:23.540
A lot of people say, "I'm a child of God" today.

0:03:23.540,0:03:30.620
There are many children of God, who say, "Jesus is Lord".

0:03:30.620,0:03:36.320
You don't need licence to do that.

0:03:36.320,0:03:51.160
Now, going by that John 6:65, "No one can come to Me unless he is enabled."

0:03:51.160,0:04:03.940
This means, for Jesus' name to be honoured, God's Word must be Spirit and life.

0:04:03.940,0:04:13.660
We have the language of today and the language of the Bible that saves, creates and rules over us.

0:04:13.660,0:04:24.620
For Jesus' name to be honoured, God's Word must be Spirit and life.

0:04:24.620,0:04:28.480
It's not just to be born of the Word but you must be born of the Spirit.

0:04:28.480,0:04:37.080
Because the Word refreshes our mind and the Spirit renews our strength.

0:04:37.080,0:04:51.600
This means, two things must join, merge and come together – the Spirit and the Word.

0:04:51.600,0:05:00.820
Two things must join and merge – the Spirit and the Word – to be born again,

0:05:00.820,0:05:04.980
for the name of Jesus to be honoured.

0:05:04.980,0:05:08.840
It's not just to say, "Be healed!"

0:05:08.840,0:05:13.940
It must be Spirit and life.

0:05:13.940,0:05:22.420
The power of God must go through the Word and the Spirit to bring about that.

0:05:22.420,0:05:25.360
That is, when you see God, you see power.

0:05:25.360,0:05:33.200
God must drive through the Spirit and the Word to bring about that.

0:05:33.200,0:05:40.000
The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ in you.

0:05:40.000,0:05:44.680
By meditation, the Word can dominate.

0:05:44.680,0:05:51.220
It dominates us through meditation, obeying, acting and reading.

0:05:51.220,0:05:56.880
Meditation is a visit to Him.

0:05:56.880,0:06:04.100
This is to say that the Word has priority over His name.

0:06:04.100,0:06:08.660
The Word has priority over His name.

0:06:08.660,0:06:13.260
This is why when you call the name "Jesus, in Jesus' name"...

0:06:13.260,0:06:21.740
Even in your dreams people come to attack you and you say, "Jesus!" but they keep attacking and beating you.

0:06:21.740,0:06:24.280
Or, after the attack you say "Jesus!".

0:06:24.280,0:06:31.540
You want to say "Jesus!" before the attack but there is no enablement, energy, power or grace.

0:06:31.540,0:06:36.120
Jesus' name is not to be called after the attack.

0:06:36.120,0:06:46.560
Anyone can say, "Thank You, Jesus" after the miracle but not everyone can say, "Jesus" before the miracle.

0:06:46.560,0:06:55.320
When you see the miracle is about to happen, you will be looking at it, "Will this happen? How will this happen?"

0:06:55.320,0:07:02.700
You will want to see how it will happen, "Can this happen?" - you will be looking at it.

0:07:02.700,0:07:08.400
When the miracle happens, "Jesus!" - but before it happens...

0:07:08.400,0:07:11.220
It takes faith to say, "Jesus"...

0:07:11.220,0:07:18.040
It takes faith to say, "Jesus, thank You" before the miracle

0:07:18.040,0:07:28.160
but anyone can say, "Jesus, thank You" after the miracle.

0:07:28.160,0:07:32.300
As you are sitting down, you have pain and challenges.

0:07:32.300,0:07:36.720
It takes faith to say, "Thank You, Jesus, It's over".

0:07:36.720,0:07:42.020
But it doesn’t take anything to say, "Jesus, thank You" when it is over.

0:07:42.020,0:07:51.100
After being healed, "Thank You, Jesus" - but now to say "Thank You, Jesus" - it takes faith.

0:07:51.100,0:07:57.320
Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He has promised to do – that is faith.

0:07:57.320,0:08:04.080
The man of faith will say, "Thank You, Jesus for blessing me" before blessing

0:08:04.080,0:08:09.380
but today, we say, "Thank You, Jesus" after blessing.

0:08:09.380,0:08:12.360
God's Word has power over His name - yes.

0:08:12.360,0:08:15.740
By the Word, we are saved.

0:08:15.740,0:08:29.960
It is the Word of God that has taught us the value, authority of the name Jesus

0:08:29.960,0:08:34.260
and our legal right to use the name, Jesus.

0:08:34.260,0:08:37.860
Anybody can use the name, Jesus but how many have the right to use the name?

0:08:37.860,0:08:42.240
How many of you can say, "Jesus" and Jesus will come to the scene?

0:08:42.240,0:08:49.640
So, until you have the legal right of using the name...

0:08:49.640,0:08:57.780
He said, "In My name you shall cast out demons" and you say, "In Jesus' name, out demon!" -

0:08:57.780,0:09:01.540
without the Word of God dominating your heart.

0:09:01.540,0:09:06.620
It is when the Word dominates your heart, it influences your character and thoughts

0:09:06.620,0:09:10.020
it influences your character and conduct.

0:09:10.020,0:09:15.340
"In My name you shall cast out demons" - yes, Bible says this.

0:09:15.340,0:09:20.400
I walk towards a demon and say, "In Jesus' name - be delivered!"

0:09:20.400,0:09:24.420
God's Word has priority over His name.

0:09:24.420,0:09:25.900
How would that happen?

0:09:25.900,0:09:29.040
How will you bring Jesus to the scene?

0:09:29.040,0:09:31.860
It is impossible.

0:09:31.860,0:09:36.900
If you don’t have God's Word, you have nothing at all.

0:09:36.900,0:09:41.800
If you don’t have God's Word, you cannot bring Jesus onto the scene.

0:09:41.800,0:09:45.360
If you don’t have God's Word, you have nothing at all.

0:09:45.360,0:09:51.920
If you don’t have God's Word, you cannot bring Jesus onto the scene.

0:09:51.920,0:09:59.740
You say, "Jesus!" and Jesus says, "What are you saying? What do you want?"

0:09:59.740,0:10:01.980
So, your song:

0:10:01.980,0:10:12.500
Jesus must be honoured
In my life every day

0:10:12.500,0:10:20.920
How can Jesus be honoured when the Word is not dominating your heart?

0:10:20.920,0:10:26.980
It is when God's Word dominates your heart, it can influence your character, thoughts and conduct.

0:10:26.980,0:10:36.200
Your character before now: "I don't know if it will happen. Can this be happening?"

0:10:36.200,0:10:41.580
When God's Word dominates your heart, it changes your perception, the way you reason.

0:10:41.580,0:10:48.560
"This will happen. It can happen. This is God's Word."

0:10:48.560,0:10:56.520
It is God's Word that builds faith in the believers.

0:10:56.520,0:11:04.380
Christ can only come to your heart through faith; your heart is His dwelling place.

0:11:04.380,0:11:13.740
That is where He dwells; the panel where He controls you, the contact point – your heart.

0:11:13.740,0:11:19.960
That is why the Bible says faith is of man's heart.

0:11:19.960,0:11:36.260
By living in the Word and by the Word living in us, we have the legal right to use the name of Jesus.

0:11:36.260,0:11:39.680
We have the legal right to the name Jesus.

0:11:39.680,0:11:44.940
Yes - Jesus!

0:11:44.940,0:11:48.960
Look at the Book of Mark 16 verse 18:

0:11:48.960,0:11:56.320
"They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."

0:11:56.320,0:12:04.980
This means nothing will ever happen without acting on the Word.

0:12:04.980,0:12:12.520
Nothing, unless we act on the Word.

0:12:12.520,0:12:20.840
Because the Word has priority over His name.

0:12:20.840,0:12:23.960
This is why you keep praying for people, "Be healed"...

0:12:23.960,0:12:28.060
Bible says, "They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover".

0:12:28.060,0:12:31.520
Because...

0:12:31.520,0:12:42.860
the Word gives value, authority and legal right.

0:12:42.860,0:12:47.780
When you call, "Jesus" without the Word, it is like you are calling your brother at home.

0:12:47.780,0:12:51.240
Many of your brothers have name Jesus.

0:12:51.240,0:12:57.400
Many people out there bear the name Jesus.

0:12:57.400,0:12:58.980
They say their own name is Jesus.

0:12:58.980,0:13:04.380
It is like calling somebody among you without the Word.

0:13:04.380,0:13:06.680
This is what you are facing.

0:13:06.680,0:13:12.900
No one can say, "Jesus is the Healer", no one can say, "Jesus is Lord",

0:13:12.900,0:13:19.620
no one can say, "Jesus is the Redeemer", unless he is guided by the Holy Spirit.

0:13:19.620,0:13:22.600
You must be guided.

0:13:22.600,0:13:25.340
We want to be like Jesus.

0:13:25.340,0:13:29.520
The Holy Spirit is our guide.

0:13:29.520,0:13:37.580
Tell your neighbour, "I want to be like Jesus. The Holy Spirit is my guide."

0:13:37.580,0:13:40.360
He must be the One to guide you to be like Him.

0:13:40.360,0:13:44.820
He must guide you to be like Jesus.

0:13:44.820,0:13:51.580
It is not like imitating your father at home, observing what your father is doing.

0:13:51.580,0:13:57.200
My father has a beard - me too, I need to have a beard.

0:13:57.200,0:14:00.680
This is the way my father walks - I need to walk like that.

0:14:00.680,0:14:02.340
That is an imitation of a man.

0:14:02.340,0:14:10.840
Imitation of God – I want to be like Jesus; the Holy Spirit is my guide.

Inner my heart

0:15:21.000,0:15:24.520
You listen to that?

0:15:24.520,0:15:27.340
Inner my heart.

0:15:27.340,0:15:36.460
I want you to open your mouth and say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe."

0:15:36.460,0:15:39.520
You hear what verse 65 of John 6 is saying.

0:15:39.520,0:15:47.460
It says, "No one can come to Me unless he is guided, enabled."

0:15:47.460,0:15:55.680
Say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe."

0:15:55.680,0:16:00.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:00.360,0:16:01.480
That is it.

0:16:01.480,0:16:04.540
I want to be like Jesus - Holy Spirit is my guide.

0:16:04.540,0:16:09.760
I cannot just wake up and say, "I want to be like Jesus. This is the way Jesus walks. I will read my Bible.

0:16:09.760,0:16:18.040
Let me see what the Bible says about Jesus - I will follow what the Bible says about Jesus" - no.

0:16:18.040,0:16:21.000
Following Jesus...

I want to be like Jesus - Holy Spirit is my guide.

0:16:27.980,0:16:37.880
He guides me, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe" - this his how I offer my prayer.

0:16:37.880,0:16:41.960
"Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe."

0:16:41.960,0:16:45.220
Only faith pleases Him.

0:16:45.220,0:16:48.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:48.600,0:16:50.000
You need to say that.

0:16:50.000,0:16:56.980
I know this is the first time you think about that this way, "You need faith to believe?"

0:16:56.980,0:16:58.520
He has said it.

0:16:58.520,0:17:06.360
It is the Word that has taught us the authority to say, "Leave, come, go!"

0:17:06.360,0:17:08.920
The Word of God taught us.

0:17:08.920,0:17:12.300
That Word must be Spirit and life.

0:17:12.300,0:17:15.560

0:17:15.560,0:17:28.100
He has promised He will never fail
I will follow Him

0:17:28.100,0:17:34.300
I will follow Him

0:17:34.300,0:17:49.040
He has promised He will never fail
His faithfulness

0:17:49.040,0:17:51.180
Listen to that.

0:17:51.180,0:17:53.140
His faithfulness.

0:17:53.140,0:18:09.360
That is why no matter what you are going through if life, declare God's faithfulness.

0:18:09.360,0:18:16.780
No matter what you are going through, no matter the situation you are in, declare God's faithfulness.

0:18:16.780,0:18:20.300
Whether He heals you or not, He is God.

0:18:20.300,0:18:29.940
He is Lord
Amen

0:18:29.940,0:18:32.960
Whether you are blessed or not...

0:18:32.960,0:18:44.340
He is Lord
Amen

0:18:44.340,0:18:48.080
That is it.

0:18:48.080,0:18:48.840
Tell your neighbour,

0:18:48.840,0:19:00.780
"No matter what you are going through, no matter your situation, declare God's faithfulness."

This is how to overcome all those things you are facing.

0:19:26.100,0:19:34.400
You see what happened to Daniel in the lion's den and to Meshach, Shadrach, Abed-Nego in the furnace.

0:19:34.400,0:19:54.380
What manner of man is Jesus
Hallelujah

0:19:54.380,0:19:56.360
That is over to you.

0:19:56.360,0:20:02.360
What manner of man is Jesus in my life I know.

0:20:02.360,0:20:05.540
In your life you know it is different.

0:20:05.540,0:20:11.520
No matter what you are going through - tell your neighbour, "Declare God's faithfulness".

0:20:11.520,0:20:16.660
(No matter what you are going through, declare God's faithfulness.)

0:20:16.660,0:20:18.260
I cannot hear you.

0:20:18.260,0:20:22.040
(No matter what you are going through, declare God's faithfulness.)

0:20:22.040,0:20:23.700
I cannot hear you.

0:20:23.700,0:20:27.840
(No matter what you are going through, declare God's faithfulness.)
