Good Morning.

0:03:03.080,0:03:10.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:10.840,0:03:19.000
I was looking at what you were seeing; the joy is so overwhelming.

0:03:19.000,0:03:26.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:26.300,0:03:31.600
I know some people here don't know how to dance, but the way they were dancing;

0:03:31.600,0:03:33.920
I was, "Oh, my God!"

0:03:33.920,0:03:36.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:36.480,0:03:45.620
The Spirit of God can inspire one to begin to...

0:03:45.620,0:03:47.320
Are you seeing that mood?

0:03:47.320,0:03:49.140
Yes!

0:03:49.140,0:03:53.260
Please, help me; hold it...

0:03:53.260,0:03:54.940
Thank you.

0:03:54.940,0:03:57.920
You may be seated.

0:03:57.920,0:04:04.520
The free spirit to fellowship – I think this is what is happening now.

0:04:04.520,0:04:16.540
The free spirit to fellowship – spirit that has nothing against his neighbour,

0:04:16.540,0:04:21.160
nothing against anyone.

0:04:21.160,0:04:27.400
Your situation, you leave it for God; don’t worry yourself.

0:04:27.400,0:04:30.660
You just see yourself the way you were created.

0:04:30.660,0:04:33.200
You are what God says you are.

0:04:33.200,0:04:35.180
You have what God says you have.

0:04:35.180,0:04:37.660
You can do what God says you can do.

0:04:37.660,0:04:42.180
That is a free spirit.

0:04:42.180,0:04:48.620
Viewers all over the world, I know you are with us and we are with you.

0:04:48.620,0:04:51.740
Bless you!

0:04:51.740,0:04:56.620
Like I have said, you need a free spirit.

0:04:56.620,0:05:05.780
Jesus cannot share with a heart that is full of unforgiveness.

0:05:05.780,0:05:07.780
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

0:05:07.780,0:05:15.480
He cannot share with a heart that is full of bitterness, envy, jealousy.

0:05:15.480,0:05:21.080
The Holy Spirit cannot share with such a heart so you need a free spirit.

0:05:21.080,0:05:29.780
It is this free spirit that craves for the Word of God, for Jesus Himself.

0:05:29.780,0:05:36.700
To hearts that are holding offence – be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:36.700,0:05:40.920
Amen!

0:05:40.920,0:05:47.680
To hearts that are full of unforgiveness – check your heart.

0:05:47.680,0:05:53.000
To hearts that are full of unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred,

0:05:53.000,0:05:58.860
envy, jealousy, still holding the pain of the past -

0:05:58.860,0:06:00.520
be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:06:00.520,0:06:02.640
Amen!

0:06:02.640,0:06:04.280
Do you know I am talking to your heart?

0:06:04.280,0:06:05.440
Yes.

0:06:05.440,0:06:07.420
No no no, you don't know.

0:06:07.420,0:06:09.860
Do you know I am talking to your heart?

0:06:09.860,0:06:13.040
Let your heart answer me.

0:06:13.040,0:06:15.200
Do you know I am talking to your heart?

0:06:15.200,0:06:16.640
Yes.

0:06:16.640,0:06:18.760
I say, “Be free, in the name of Jesus!”

0:06:18.760,0:06:21.620
Amen!

0:06:21.620,0:06:32.040
To hearts that are full of unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred, jealousy, envy, anger -

0:06:32.040,0:06:34.440
be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:34.440,0:06:36.060
Amen!

0:06:36.060,0:06:43.060
Viewers all over the world, check yourselves.

0:06:43.060,0:06:54.120
If you are still holding grudges against anyone, you have already offended the Holy Spirit.

0:06:54.120,0:07:02.040
Holding grudges, bitterness, envy, jealousy, against anyone -

0:07:02.040,0:07:07.300
you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:07:07.300,0:07:09.200
Be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:07:09.200,0:07:11.540
Amen!

0:07:11.540,0:07:14.180
Because we would not be able to move forward;

0:07:14.180,0:07:24.560
I would not be able to carry you along – hearts that are full of offence, full of envy, jealousy.

0:07:24.560,0:07:30.280
You would just be seeing what is happening but to be part of what is happening is impossible

0:07:30.280,0:07:34.340
because of offence, because of envy,

0:07:34.340,0:07:39.060
because of jealousy, because of bitterness.

0:07:39.060,0:07:41.480
Check your heart.

0:07:41.480,0:07:45.480
Say, “My heart, be free!

0:07:45.480,0:07:52.360
My heart, crave for God; crave for the Word of God!"

0:07:52.360,0:07:54.820
I cannot hear you.

0:07:54.820,0:07:58.380
My heart, be free!

0:07:58.380,0:08:04.480
My heart!

0:08:04.480,0:08:12.600
Our heart is the contact point, the place of point for Jesus.

0:08:12.600,0:08:17.080
If Jesus is coming to you, it is not your eyes, it is not your mouth, it is not your appearance -

0:08:17.080,0:08:20.360
it is your heart.

0:08:20.360,0:08:27.980
My heart, crave for the Word of God!
My heart, yearn for the Word of God!

Sometimes we can be dancing, be happy, just emotional - feeling.

0:08:40.280,0:08:46.420
Happiness can be found around, just in what is happening.

0:08:46.420,0:08:52.140
Just get it around, and after leaving that place it is over.

0:08:52.140,0:08:55.140
My heart!

0:08:55.140,0:09:04.040
I want to carry you along; this is why we are talking to your real self – your heart.

0:09:04.040,0:09:06.360
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

0:09:06.360,0:09:07.920
Be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:07.920,0:09:12.880
Amen!

0:09:12.880,0:09:18.500
Are you there with me?

0:09:18.500,0:09:20.580
I am not saying this body.

0:09:20.580,0:09:25.220
I know you are on the seat; I know you are looking at me.

0:09:25.220,0:09:28.940
You can be looking at me, sitting down, whereas you are not here.

If your heart is not at its best, don’t be surprised if the Bible is no more real to you -

0:11:08.760,0:11:15.000
the Bible you carry is no more real, is a literature, is history.

0:11:15.000,0:11:26.140
If your heart is not at its best, the Bible you carry becomes a history book, not Bible.

0:11:26.140,0:11:36.460
Tell your neighbour, “If my heart is not at its best, the Bible you carry automatically becomes history,

0:11:36.460,0:11:46.120
a history book just about apostles, stories about apostles, just history, literature.

0:11:46.120,0:11:53.200
It is no longer Bible if your heart is not at its best.

0:11:53.200,0:12:00.340
That is why we have not been seeing the reflection of the Bible in your life.

0:12:00.340,0:12:01.960
People see you carrying the Bible -

0:12:01.960,0:12:10.580
no, it is literature, a mere history book you are carrying because your heart is not at its best.

0:12:10.580,0:12:13.300
Your heart must be at its best.

0:12:13.300,0:12:18.280
Sometimes, if your heart is not at its best, you can even drop it and talk to yourself -

0:12:18.280,0:12:26.600
get yourself together.

0:12:26.600,0:12:31.220
If my heart is not at its best, I would not come here; I would not be here.

0:12:31.220,0:12:33.840
I would not have contact with the Holy Spirit.

0:12:33.840,0:12:40.480
It is when our heart is at its best, there is contact.

0:12:40.480,0:13:02.220

0:13:02.220,0:13:23.480
Lord I want to be like Jesus

0:13:23.480,0:13:28.080
These are the things you need to do before prayer.

0:13:28.080,0:13:40.080
Are you at your best before prayer, before, “In Jesus’ name”?

0:13:40.080,0:13:45.080
Your heart must be at its best before you begin to pray.

0:13:45.080,0:13:58.180
You don’t just stand up and say, “Let us pray”.

0:13:58.180,0:14:12.860
As you are watching the virtues, the healing power,

0:14:12.860,0:14:16.480
take this song, continue to sing this song:

0:14:16.480,0:14:36.480
Inner my heart

0:14:36.480,0:14:55.340
Lord I want to be like Jesus
Inner my heart

0:14:55.340,0:15:01.280
Each time you see that healing happen, it is the presence of God -

0:15:01.280,0:15:05.860
through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:15:05.860,0:15:10.260
“Jesus” – you see people getting healed; it means Jesus is there.

0:15:10.260,0:15:19.680
Quickly invite Him to your heart; let Him take more of you.

0:15:19.680,0:15:24.060
You have been praying; now, you are seeing it coming.

0:15:24.060,0:15:29.480
You can see, "That is Jesus."

0:15:29.480,0:15:36.500
Quickly invite Him to your heart; get Him in your heart.

0:15:36.500,0:15:41.340
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.
