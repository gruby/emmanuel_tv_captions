0:00:00.220,0:00:03.500
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

0:00:03.500,0:00:06.020
- From where?
- From South Africa.

0:00:06.020,0:00:09.140
What did you hear me say?

0:00:09.140,0:00:14.400
That my faith shouldn't be based on the improvement after prayer.

0:00:14.400,0:00:18.900
Your faith should not be based on the improvement.

0:00:18.900,0:00:22.400
What should your faith be based on?

0:00:22.400,0:00:28.140
I should be patient. If God does not answer, it doesn't mean that it is no.

0:00:28.140,0:00:30.960
It means He is waiting for the right time.

0:00:30.960,0:00:32.960
Clap for her.

0:00:35.880,0:00:41.340
Before now, how have you been living your Christian life when it comes to prayer?

0:00:41.340,0:00:48.920
I've been praying but sometimes when I see things don't come my way, I lose hope.

0:00:48.920,0:00:50.340
But this time?

0:00:50.340,0:00:57.420
But this time, because of your message, I will be strong.

0:00:57.420,0:00:59.280
You are healed already.

0:00:59.280,0:01:01.280
Yes, sir.

0:01:01.280,0:01:05.780
You have received Jesus; you are healed to heal others.

0:01:05.780,0:01:06.660
Yes, sir.

0:01:06.660,0:01:10.340
Touch your leg.

0:01:10.340,0:01:12.340
The other one.

0:01:12.340,0:01:18.640
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:01:18.640,0:01:26.640
I'm not there; I'm here.

0:01:26.640,0:01:29.800
Here I am; I'm not there.

0:01:29.800,0:01:35.060
I'm not there; I'm here.

0:01:35.060,0:01:37.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:37.880,0:01:41.480
What happened?

0:01:41.480,0:01:43.480
[Power of God.]

0:01:43.480,0:01:44.760
I said, "What happened?"

0:01:44.760,0:01:46.200
[Power of God.]

0:01:46.200,0:01:49.060
Ah - power happened.

0:01:49.060,0:01:52.980
I said, "What happened?". You said, "Power!" What is power?

0:01:52.980,0:01:55.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:55.060,0:01:59.760
That is all. This is what we've been talking about.

0:01:59.760,0:02:02.320
This is just it.

0:02:02.320,0:02:07.580
What happened is that Jesus immediately came to the scene.

0:02:07.580,0:02:13.280
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:02:13.280,0:02:17.100
What happened?

0:02:17.100,0:02:19.580
Jesus immediately came to the scene.

0:02:19.580,0:02:24.580
Thank You, Jesus! I can walk now!

0:02:24.580,0:02:26.840
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:02:26.840,0:02:30.760
Thank You, Jesus! I can walk now! I am healed!

0:02:30.760,0:02:35.560
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:35.560,0:02:39.540
My name is Lerato Motsoari from South Africa.

0:02:39.540,0:02:42.260
I had a problem of lymphedema.

0:02:42.260,0:02:50.120
That is, the circulation was not okay in my feet so it caused a blockade down there.

0:02:50.120,0:02:54.300
You would see a lot of water not flowing the correct way.

0:02:54.300,0:02:58.600
I couldn't walk for a long distance and I couldn't stand for long.

0:02:58.600,0:03:01.800
I would feel pains and discomfort.

0:03:01.800,0:03:05.180
That really caused a lot of problems.

0:03:05.180,0:03:10.840
Even when I wanted to buy shoes, I would struggle to find them in the right size.

0:03:10.840,0:03:15.260
My self-esteem was low. I'm a teacher.

0:03:15.260,0:03:19.360
When the learners were looking at me when I was wearing a skirt,

0:03:19.360,0:03:24.620
I would feel uncomfortable because they could see that my feet were not equal.

0:03:24.620,0:03:27.580
One foot was too big and the other one was little.

0:03:27.580,0:03:30.620
You mean the problem affected your teaching career.

0:03:30.620,0:03:37.620
Yes, I had to stand for long and standing was a problem because of pains.

0:03:37.620,0:03:41.600
On Sunday, I came; I was sittng over there.

0:03:41.600,0:03:46.040
The man of God came and said, I should touch my feet.

0:03:46.040,0:03:51.300
I did that. I don't really know what happened after that.

0:03:51.300,0:03:54.280
I asked people, "Did the man of God pray for me?"

0:03:54.280,0:03:56.580
They said, "No, he didn't pray for you".

0:03:56.580,0:03:58.640
I don't really know what happened.

0:03:58.640,0:04:02.860
You mean you cannot explain what happened to you after the Prophet had asked you to touch your legs?

0:04:02.860,0:04:06.240
No, I can't really.

0:04:06.240,0:04:09.520
I can walk without any discomfort.

0:04:09.520,0:04:12.120
I don't feel any pains now.

0:04:12.120,0:04:20.820
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:04:20.820,0:04:25.140
This one, I could not tap it like this.

0:04:25.140,0:04:27.600
I would start feeling a lot of pains.

0:04:27.600,0:04:32.100
It would tell me that I had walked too much or tapped it a lot.

0:04:32.100,0:04:34.420
So, I would feel discomfort.

0:04:34.420,0:04:40.080
If I walked a lot like a long distance, my feet would swell up

0:04:40.080,0:04:42.520
and the discomfort would come again.

0:04:42.520,0:04:44.700
But now, are you feeling any pains?

0:04:44.700,0:04:47.560
I'm feeling okay; I can twist it like that.

0:04:47.560,0:04:54.240
Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:04:54.240,0:04:58.580
This is how my feet used to look like - they were big.

0:04:58.580,0:05:06.180
But now, they are no longer big.

0:05:06.180,0:05:09.500
I used to struggle to find the right shoe size.

0:05:09.500,0:05:13.920
When I wanted to buy new shoes, I would have to check the ones that are comfortable

0:05:13.920,0:05:18.440
because immediately when my feet swelled up, I would feel the pain too much.

0:05:18.440,0:05:21.680
But now, I believe I can buy any type of shoes.

0:05:21.680,0:05:28.320
Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:05:28.320,0:05:38.380
Jesus Christ is still the Healer. We have to believe in Him. That's all.

0:05:38.380,0:05:43.280
You are healed by Christ's Word. You should go and live by that Word.

0:05:43.280,0:05:45.840
Make God's Word the standard for your life

0:05:45.840,0:05:48.520
so that the healing and deliverance that God has given you

0:05:48.520,0:05:51.820
will remain permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:05:51.820,0:05:52.900
Amen.
