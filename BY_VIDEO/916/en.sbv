0:00:01.620,0:00:08.300
There is a brother that just came back from the prison yard.

0:00:08.300,0:00:12.440
The key thing is that your wife was the one who reported you

0:00:12.440,0:00:15.300
and immediately they deported you.

0:00:15.300,0:00:19.040
He is under the gallery.

0:00:19.040,0:00:20.080
Prophecy Time

0:00:20.080,0:00:25.540
I am the person the man of God prophesied about, who has been to prison

0:00:25.540,0:00:27.540
and was reported by his wife.

0:00:27.540,0:00:31.200
Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance to people

0:00:31.200,0:00:35.500
from across the world in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:35.500,0:00:41.600
As he prays for Mr Sioni, the evil spirit responsible for his recent calamity is arrested

0:00:41.600,0:00:43.600
and confesses its crimes.

0:00:43.600,0:00:44.420
Who are you?

0:00:44.420,0:00:45.080
Family idol.

0:00:45.080,0:00:47.300
What have you done to him?

0:00:47.300,0:00:48.000
Fornication.

0:00:48.000,0:00:48.780
What else?

0:00:48.780,0:00:50.240
Pornography.

0:00:50.240,0:00:52.040
Debt.

0:00:52.040,0:00:53.380
Deportation.

0:00:53.380,0:00:54.780
You deported him from where?

0:00:54.780,0:00:55.920
From America.

0:00:55.920,0:00:57.920
What happened that he was deported?

0:00:57.920,0:01:00.500
He abused a child.

0:01:00.500,0:01:01.960
Failure.

0:01:01.960,0:01:03.180
What have you done to his marriage?

0:01:03.180,0:01:04.280
No marriage.

0:01:04.280,0:01:05.880
How did you enter him?

0:01:05.880,0:01:08.080
Idol.

0:01:08.080,0:01:12.800
After the confession of the evil spirit for the world to hear and learn,

0:01:12.800,0:01:17.260
Prophet T.B. Joshua delivers Mr. Sioni from every hidden spirit

0:01:17.260,0:01:21.620
threatening his peace, his success and his future.

0:01:21.620,0:01:26.320
As he falls to the ground, the wicked spirit is cast out forever.

0:01:26.320,0:01:28.820
Thank You, Lord! I'm delivered!

0:01:28.820,0:01:33.040
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:33.040,0:01:36.020
People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:36.020,0:01:38.900
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:38.900,0:01:45.400
My name is Sioni Ayodeji Fanugbami

0:01:45.400,0:01:50.240
I am from Ondo State (Nigeria).

0:01:50.240,0:01:57.040
I was a resident in the U.S. before coming back to Nigeria.

0:01:57.040,0:02:03.060
First of all, I want to apologise to the man of God

0:02:03.060,0:02:13.600
because I used to be one of those people who really didn't believe in this ministry and the man of God,

0:02:13.600,0:02:21.360
following the bandwagon of disinformation because people used to say that

0:02:21.360,0:02:24.480
he buries some cows somewhere here,

0:02:24.480,0:02:28.860
he uses snake power,

0:02:28.860,0:02:32.360
he sleeps with some of his staff,

0:02:32.360,0:02:34.840
he consults the devil.

0:02:34.840,0:02:36.840
So I believed all that.

0:02:36.840,0:02:43.260
But I never knew that he was the one who would end up being my deliverer.

0:02:43.260,0:02:49.120
I want to apologise and ask for forgiveness;

0:02:49.120,0:02:54.500
ask God for forgiveness for castigating the man of God.

0:02:54.500,0:03:00.280
The problem that brought me here - as the prophet said - was prison.

0:03:00.280,0:03:05.680
In 2006, I left the country on U.S. visa lottery.

0:03:05.680,0:03:10.860
Ok. Before you left the country, sir, could you tell us a little bit more about the kind of family you are from,

0:03:10.860,0:03:13.600
and what happened that you left the country for America.

0:03:13.600,0:03:17.780
I came from a very poor background.

0:03:17.780,0:03:19.400
My people were still in Ondo State.

0:03:19.400,0:03:23.140
They even still do not fancy me coming here.

0:03:23.140,0:03:27.780
But there is nothing that anybody can do; this is my place of salvation.

0:03:27.780,0:03:31.000
Through me, all of them will come here eventually.

0:03:31.000,0:03:34.880
This is a part of my testimony - my life story.

0:03:34.880,0:03:37.660
I came from a very poor background.

0:03:37.660,0:03:39.740
I was struggling before I left.

0:03:39.740,0:03:43.860
I was working at a printing press in Lagos before I left.

0:03:43.860,0:03:49.820
It was during that time in 2005 that I applied for the visa lottery.

0:03:49.820,0:03:55.360
I was selected, went through the process and then travelled out.

0:03:55.360,0:04:00.780
My family background - I was born a Muslim.

0:04:00.780,0:04:03.800
On my father's side they are Muslims; on my mother's side they are Christians.

0:04:03.800,0:04:07.760
In the middle we have the family idols and all that.

0:04:07.760,0:04:12.880
I have really been exposed to all kinds of horrible elements

0:04:12.880,0:04:20.340
like eating at the shrine, going with masquerades,

0:04:20.340,0:04:28.320
a lot of bad dreams - dreaming of snakes, cows chasing me, people shooting at me.

0:04:28.320,0:04:33.720
So it has really been tough but in 2006 I left the country for the USA.

0:04:33.720,0:04:41.660
When I got there in 2006, I was supposed to be serious with God.

0:04:41.660,0:04:50.760
But I was never serious with God; I was living the American dream in the wrong way.

0:04:50.760,0:04:53.740
I began drinking alcohol.

0:04:53.740,0:04:58.040
As someone who had never been drinking before travelling out,

0:04:58.040,0:05:00.400
I began drinking when I got to the U.S.

0:05:00.400,0:05:02.620
The level of alcohol I was drinking -

0:05:02.620,0:05:07.540
you would expect someone who had never been drinking to start small.

0:05:07.540,0:05:12.920
But I started with the strongest alcohol you could find there

0:05:12.920,0:05:17.500
like the fire-in-your-bones alcohol so that when I drank it, I passed out.

0:05:17.500,0:05:21.660
I would not know where I was until the next day when I opened my eyes.

0:05:21.660,0:05:23.360
All these things continued.

0:05:23.360,0:05:30.540
At a point, when I was at university, I dated seven different ladies.

0:05:30.540,0:05:33.060
None of them knew each other.

0:05:33.060,0:05:37.240
I would schedule one for the morning, I would schedule one for the afternoon,

0:05:37.240,0:05:42.140
I would schedule one for the evening and schedule one for the night.

0:05:42.140,0:05:44.100
I was really out there.

0:05:44.100,0:05:47.200
I began smoking and going to clubs.

0:05:47.200,0:05:52.020
So at that point, you were in a relationship with seven different women at the same time,

0:05:52.020,0:05:54.520
and none of them knew that you were with another woman?

0:05:54.520,0:05:57.680
None of them knew.

0:05:57.680,0:06:00.880
I kept on going like that.

0:06:00.880,0:06:03.040
I lost focus.

0:06:03.040,0:06:07.980
Eventually I even had to drop out of university - biochemistry with a focus on premedicine.

0:06:07.980,0:06:10.180
I had to drop out eventually.

0:06:10.180,0:06:19.700
It was one the ladies that I had been with for three years that called the police on me

0:06:19.700,0:06:22.440
because one of the nights that I was at her house -

0:06:22.440,0:06:26.500
I was already drunk, we were both drunk, I was wasted -

0:06:26.500,0:06:30.560
by the time I opened my eyes in the morning, I was in the child's bedroom.

0:06:30.560,0:06:38.500
So the problem was already there and the child told the mother that I was trying to rape her.

0:06:38.500,0:06:41.340
We just want to understand clearly what happened in this scenario.

0:06:41.340,0:06:43.380
You said you were completely drunk

0:06:43.380,0:06:47.300
and when you woke up, you were in the bedroom of a young child -

0:06:47.300,0:06:48.980
the child of that lady.

0:06:48.980,0:06:52.120
And that is how you woke up in that scenario?

0:06:52.120,0:06:57.080
Yes, I was extremely drunk, we were both drunk - I and the child's mum.

0:06:57.080,0:06:58.660
When I woke up---

0:06:58.660,0:07:03.300
Like I said, when I drank, I wouldn't know what happened because of the alcohol I took.

0:07:03.300,0:07:09.020
If you google the kind of alcohol I took, it can drive a car.

0:07:09.020,0:07:10.700
That was what I was drinking.

0:07:10.700,0:07:12.980
And tequila is very strong.

0:07:12.980,0:07:14.380
And brandy is very strong.

0:07:14.380,0:07:19.460
So I would blend tequila and brandy; I would spice it with a little bit of orange juice.

0:07:19.460,0:07:21.020
That is what I would drink.

0:07:21.020,0:07:22.420
I would be lost.

0:07:22.420,0:07:25.080
Even one of my girlfriends said---

0:07:25.080,0:07:29.480
There was a night that I was with her - this is another lady.

0:07:29.480,0:07:34.280
After I woke up in morning, she said she was scared because she thought I was dead

0:07:34.280,0:07:40.620
because I was just laying in bed like I wasn't breathing, my chest wasn't moving.

0:07:40.620,0:07:42.860
So that is the way I would drink.

0:07:42.860,0:07:45.500
I would drink and then just lose consciousness.

0:07:45.500,0:07:49.400
This is precisely what happened with this lady that night.

0:07:49.400,0:07:56.000
When I woke up in the morning, that is when I realised, "Oh, why did I end up in here?"

0:07:56.000,0:08:00.720
And then the little child told her mother that I was trying to rape her.

0:08:00.720,0:08:04.880
She called the police; I couldn't reconcile with her.

0:08:04.880,0:08:06.400
I was arrested.

0:08:06.400,0:08:12.680
I was put into detention for three months, got bonded out and then I began going to trial.

0:08:12.680,0:08:20.700
It was when I now began going to trial in 2013 that I met a man of God

0:08:20.700,0:08:25.440
whose ministry is a partner with Emmanuel TV in the U.S.

0:08:25.440,0:08:29.020
He was the one who introduced me to this ministry.

0:08:29.020,0:08:36.140
At first when he told me, I was like, "What in the world are you doing with T.B. Joshua?

0:08:36.140,0:08:40.640
You could have gone to a better place where they've got real fire,

0:08:40.640,0:08:43.200
where they preach real gospel".

0:08:43.200,0:08:47.340
I never knew that T.B. Joshua was the one who would end up delivering me.

0:08:47.340,0:08:51.380
Even though I came from the same region, the same state where the prophet is from,

0:08:51.380,0:08:53.460
I never truly believed in him.

0:08:53.460,0:08:57.820
That was how I got to know Emmanuel TV.

0:08:57.820,0:09:01.620
So it was an American pastor in the USA

0:09:01.620,0:09:05.280
who was actually the one who told you about Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:09:05.280,0:09:09.800
Even though you are a Nigerian and from the same state, you never believed in him.

0:09:09.800,0:09:13.800
It was this encouragement from an American pastor that opened your eyes

0:09:13.800,0:09:18.280
to discover Emmanuel TV and know Prophet T.B. Joshua - the truth about him.

0:09:18.280,0:09:20.480
Absolutely.

0:09:20.480,0:09:26.040
I was even trying to discourage him from talking about it or playing the videos.

0:09:26.040,0:09:35.980
I was like, "This man ain't real. Go to other places where they preach real gospel".

0:09:35.980,0:09:42.820
Eventually I started listening. I was like, "I must listen to what this man is all about".

0:09:42.820,0:09:45.840
Even though I had known about him before I left the country

0:09:45.840,0:09:51.860
but because of disinformation, I didn't want to have anything to do with him.

0:09:51.860,0:09:56.060
Eventually I began listening to the prophet, and I began praying with him.

0:09:56.060,0:09:58.820
And then hope started coming to me.

0:09:58.820,0:10:01.160
Even though I was already going through trial -

0:10:01.160,0:10:09.660
in fact, I was looking at 30 to 40 years in prison for the sentence.

0:10:09.660,0:10:13.920
When I began praying with the prophet, hope began coming.

0:10:13.920,0:10:18.660
When I lost the case and they gave me simple battery, I was shocked,

0:10:18.660,0:10:23.400
"Oh my God! Without a paid lawyer and you got a public defender!

0:10:23.400,0:10:28.640
And you got a simple battery over a case as significant as this!"

0:10:28.640,0:10:34.180
I was grateful and then they gave me a five-year sentence in 2014.

0:10:34.180,0:10:39.780
By the special grace of God, they let me out after two years.

0:10:39.780,0:10:46.880
When they let me out, I came here and I have been coming since I got back this year.

0:10:46.880,0:10:54.040
Ok. So a sentence that you were expecting to be 30 to 40 years because of the issue of rape

0:10:54.040,0:10:57.340
actually ended up being just a five-year prison sentence.

0:10:57.340,0:11:01.280
And after two years, you were released and deported back to Nigeria.

0:11:01.280,0:11:03.920
Absolutely.

0:11:03.920,0:11:10.480
When they let me out, I had to leave the country because I was not a U.S. citizen.

0:11:10.480,0:11:18.520
After I had been in the U.S. for ten years, they said I had to leave because they couldn't let me stay there.

0:11:18.520,0:11:21.780
I signed and then ended up in Nigeria.

0:11:21.780,0:11:29.960
When I came, it happened that as God loves me so much, He gave me a new beginning.

0:11:29.960,0:11:38.760
On the 7th of this month, I had a revelation and I saw the prophet giving me a note.

0:11:38.760,0:11:42.540
On that note, he wrote the number 17.

0:11:42.540,0:11:44.800
That was on the 7th of this month.

0:11:44.800,0:11:51.000
So he gave me a note with the number 17 on it but I never really understood it.

0:11:51.000,0:11:55.640
Here was the prophet giving me a note with the number 17 on it but I never really understood it.

0:11:55.640,0:12:05.380
But then when I came to church on Sunday, the 16th, he called my case.

0:12:05.380,0:12:09.340
And when I stepped out, that was it.

0:12:09.340,0:12:15.860
On the 17th that he had written down on the note was the day I got my deliverance.

0:12:15.860,0:12:20.480
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:20.480,0:12:24.480
Brother, can you just describe to us when you received that deliverance.

0:12:24.480,0:12:29.120
What happened to you as the prophet prayed for you?

0:12:29.120,0:12:34.700
Even before I left Nigeria, it had been one nightmare after another.

0:12:34.700,0:12:37.300
I would see cows chasing me, like I said.

0:12:37.300,0:12:44.960
I would see all kinds of strangers; some of them would be men trying to romance me.

0:12:44.960,0:12:50.340
Snakes would be biting me; people would be shooting at me.

0:12:50.340,0:12:55.120
I got shot three times in my dreams.

0:12:55.120,0:13:01.100
Masquerades were coming after me like, "You got something we need!"

0:13:01.100,0:13:03.140
They would be chasing me all around.

0:13:03.140,0:13:07.680
It was one nightmare after another - eating in the dreams and all that.

0:13:07.680,0:13:15.440
But then after I was prayed for, since Monday, I have been sleeping like a little baby.

0:13:15.440,0:13:20.600
I have no bad dreams - no woman is showing up in my dreams;

0:13:20.600,0:13:25.120
no ghost is trying to get me.

0:13:25.120,0:13:26.920
I'm grateful to God.

0:13:26.920,0:13:29.960
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:29.960,0:13:32.620
So that was how our brother was completely delivered.

0:13:32.620,0:13:36.340
Brother, as the prophet prayed for you, we saw that evil spirit manifesting.

0:13:36.340,0:13:38.340
Can you just recall what happened when he prayed for you?

0:13:38.340,0:13:40.800
How did you feel at that moment when he prayed for you?

0:13:40.800,0:13:51.780
When his hand hit me, it was like my brain was put into trillion different places.

0:13:51.780,0:13:56.280
And then I just lost it.

0:13:56.280,0:14:00.840
There was something telling me, "What are you doing?"

0:14:00.840,0:14:04.880
But I couldn't control it; I was no longer myself.

0:14:04.880,0:14:06.740
The power of God already took over.

0:14:06.740,0:14:13.360
In fact, the Sunday night that the prophet called me out,

0:14:13.360,0:14:20.120
I had a dream and I saw this huge guy that I had never seen before.

0:14:20.120,0:14:25.500
One of his arms was about my whole size.

0:14:25.500,0:14:27.500
The guy was so huge.

0:14:27.500,0:14:30.060
That was the Sunday night I received the prophecy.

0:14:30.060,0:14:34.580
He was telling me, "Oh, where have you been?

0:14:34.580,0:14:37.280
Because I didn't come with you to church on Sunday.

0:14:37.280,0:14:41.040
Do you think you can escape from me?"

0:14:41.040,0:14:44.060
I asked him, "Who are you? and then the dream just changed.

0:14:44.060,0:14:49.480
That was the ancestral spirit, the family idol,

0:14:49.480,0:14:55.020
the stronghold that had been impeding me all my life.

0:14:55.020,0:14:57.380
And that was how that spirit was cast out,

0:14:57.380,0:14:59.420
and ever since then your life has changed?

0:14:59.420,0:15:00.680
Yes, sir.

0:15:00.680,0:15:05.480
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:15:05.480,0:15:07.860
Brother, in the course of your testimony, you mentioned as well

0:15:07.860,0:15:13.060
that you were under the affliction of this spirit of lust, alcoholism, smoking.

0:15:13.060,0:15:18.440
Ever since that deliverance, what can you tell us about the changes in those areas?

0:15:18.440,0:15:23.180
When that crisis hit, it was like the Lord Jesus actually used that crisis

0:15:23.180,0:15:29.080
to slap me back into reality because He loves me; I believe He loves me.

0:15:29.080,0:15:31.280
I have seen Him in my revelation too.

0:15:31.280,0:15:38.400
All the urges, all the desires, all the gravings for all that are gone now.

0:15:38.400,0:15:42.600
I have peace like I have never had before in my life.

0:15:42.600,0:15:45.600
That hit me when I was delivered.

0:15:45.600,0:15:51.000
It was like somebody lifted a truck off my chest.

0:15:51.000,0:15:53.020
I felt so light.

0:15:53.020,0:15:57.700
After my deliverance I was laughing and rejoicing; I was happy.

0:15:57.700,0:16:01.380
Ever since then I have just been happy.

0:16:01.380,0:16:05.420
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:16:05.420,0:16:06.840
We thank God for our brother's life.

0:16:06.840,0:16:11.460
Right now, sir, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?

0:16:11.460,0:16:16.520
Oh man! The greatest lesson for me here is:

0:16:16.520,0:16:21.600
If God loves you, He won't take 'no' for an answer.

0:16:21.600,0:16:27.080
It is very painful to be disciplined by God, even though the end is going to be good.

0:16:27.080,0:16:28.400
But it is painful.

0:16:28.400,0:16:30.560
I really didn't have to go through all this

0:16:30.560,0:16:33.300
but this is the way I chose to learn a simple lesson.

0:16:33.300,0:16:42.400
And the lesson is: Don't ever be on the wrong side of history with God.

0:16:42.400,0:16:45.380
Believe in Him, trust in Him.

0:16:45.380,0:16:48.020
Put all of your hope on Him.

0:16:48.020,0:16:52.080
And He will definitely take you to your final destination.

0:16:52.080,0:16:56.380
Amen. Glory be to God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:16:56.380,0:17:02.200
Finally, sir, you said you were in the past among those who condemned Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:17:02.200,0:17:04.920
criticised him, call him all sorts of names.

0:17:04.920,0:17:07.860
But at the end of the day, the person you thought was a devil

0:17:07.860,0:17:10.960
ended up being the same person that God used to deliver you.

0:17:10.960,0:17:14.400
What is your word of advice to people who have maybe a similar impression

0:17:14.400,0:17:17.800
or have a negative opinion towards Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:17:17.800,0:17:21.440
as a result of rumours or slanderous remarks they have heard

0:17:21.440,0:17:25.460
based on your own life experience?

0:17:25.460,0:17:30.140
Even now when I hear the prophet, it is like I have never even heard his voice before.

0:17:30.140,0:17:33.920
I can feel the love coming out of his messages.

0:17:33.920,0:17:36.580
I can feel the power coming out of his heart.

0:17:36.580,0:17:40.340
My advice to everybody out there who is sceptical is:

0:17:40.340,0:17:44.540
Please, stop begin sceptical; you are delaying yourself.

0:17:44.540,0:17:47.060
You are really holding yourself back.

0:17:47.060,0:17:53.600
It is not godly, it is not righteous to talk against a man of God.

0:17:53.600,0:17:58.260
The step of righteousness is for you to go to God and find out -

0:17:58.260,0:18:01.120
"Is this guy real? Is this guy genuine?" -

0:18:01.120,0:18:07.240
before you join folks who don't know what they are doing to be castigating a man of God.

0:18:07.240,0:18:11.200
Please, one word: Stop!

0:18:11.200,0:18:17.680
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:18:17.680,0:18:21.860
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:18:21.860,0:18:25.420
My name is Sioni Ayodeji Fanugbami.

0:18:25.420,0:18:27.720
I am from Ondo State, Nigeria.

0:18:27.720,0:18:30.880
I was recently deported from America.

0:18:30.880,0:18:34.100
You are welcome, brother. Can you tell us what Jesus Christ has done in your life

0:18:34.100,0:18:36.840
since you stepped your feet into The SCOAN?

0:18:36.840,0:18:40.520
It has been mind blowing; it's been amazing.

0:18:40.520,0:18:42.940
It is undescribable.

0:18:42.940,0:18:49.480
Contrary to my previous opinion about this place, I was really proven wrong.

0:18:49.480,0:18:55.080
Since I came here, the prophet has showered me with nothing but love.

0:18:55.080,0:18:59.620
They've been taking care of me.

0:18:59.620,0:19:05.820
I received my deliverance here, and I'm extremely grateful to God and to the prophet.

0:19:05.820,0:19:07.140
We thank God for your life, brother.

0:19:07.140,0:19:12.540
Now that you have received your deliverance and are ready to start life afresh with Christ Jesus,

0:19:12.540,0:19:16.520
what plans do you have now, what steps you want to take?

0:19:16.520,0:19:25.660
Actually, my number one priority in life now, in fact the only desire I have now is to do the will of God.

0:19:25.660,0:19:28.580
Even though I already have so many business plans drawn up,

0:19:28.580,0:19:33.060
I know I need wisdom to guide me where to go to from here.

0:19:33.060,0:19:35.900
My number one desire now is to do the will of God.

0:19:35.900,0:19:39.580
If I do business, it is going to be Kingdom business.

0:19:39.580,0:19:42.760
And if I do ministry, it is going to be Kingdom ministry.

0:19:42.760,0:19:46.980
Just looking for every opportunity to serve God for the rest of my days.

0:19:46.980,0:19:51.540
We thank God for your life. On a very practical note, when you were deported from America to Nigeria,

0:19:51.540,0:19:54.120
is it that you literally came with nothing?

0:19:54.120,0:19:55.960
I absolutely came with nothing.

0:19:55.960,0:20:01.500
In fact, the pants and trousers I am wearing right now are the only trousers I came down with,

0:20:01.500,0:20:04.120
with two shirts and one pair of shoes.

0:20:04.120,0:20:07.780
I have been living with my junior brother ever since I got back.

0:20:07.780,0:20:11.800
In fact, I came back from America with 280 USD.

0:20:11.800,0:20:14.840
Armed robbers came to the house and stole some of it.

0:20:14.840,0:20:19.080
The rest just went into personal upkeep.

0:20:19.080,0:20:23.540
I really have nothing, and I literally have no one to help me.

0:20:23.540,0:20:28.020
We have listened to our brother. We thank God that he has been delivered from his past life.

0:20:28.020,0:20:31.400
He has been restored by our Lord Jesus Christ, here at The SCOAN

0:20:31.400,0:20:33.680
after receiving that word of prophecy and deliverance.

0:20:33.680,0:20:36.740
Brother, we are here right now with a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:36.740,0:20:40.800
The man of God said that he wants to support you in all departments of your life

0:20:40.800,0:20:43.260
as you are about to start this new journey with Christ.

0:20:43.260,0:20:47.140
Not only in your spiritual life but also materially and financially as well.

0:20:47.140,0:20:49.640
So on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,

0:20:49.640,0:20:56.540
we are here to present to you this cash gift of 200,000 naira as well as the Word of God.

0:20:56.540,0:21:04.400
Oh my God!

0:21:04.400,0:21:08.020
This is super amazing!

0:21:08.020,0:21:10.960
Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua!

0:21:10.960,0:21:13.360
This is mind blowing! This is beyond me!

0:21:13.360,0:21:19.560
In fact, my mindset for coming here was not for money because I could spend money easily.

0:21:19.560,0:21:25.380
My mindset for coming here was really to encounter the real love of God of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:21:25.380,0:21:28.580
and I'm glad I have done so.

0:21:28.580,0:21:30.700
This is the first part of my testimony.

0:21:30.700,0:21:34.380
The second, third, fourth, fifth parts are still coming.

0:21:34.380,0:21:38.180
But I'm extremely grateful to the prophet.

0:21:38.180,0:21:40.180
I thank the Emmanuel TV partners.

0:21:40.180,0:21:42.480
I love you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:21:42.480,0:21:44.240
Wow, we thank God Almighty.

0:21:44.240,0:21:48.400
In addition to the 200,000 naira, we are also giving you the Word of God, 'The Mirror',

0:21:48.400,0:21:50.620
just as a reminder for you as you have rightly said.

0:21:50.620,0:21:54.480
Go out there and make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:21:54.480,0:21:58.040
So once again, this is 200,000 naira as well as the Word of God

0:21:58.040,0:22:00.440
from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners

0:22:00.440,0:22:04.760
for our brother to really begin his new life with Christ Jesus in a wonderful way.

0:22:04.760,0:22:08.640
Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua! Thank you, Emmanuel TV partners!

0:22:08.640,0:22:10.860
Thank You, Lord Jesus, for bringing me here!

0:22:10.860,0:22:13.340
I'm grateful; I'm extremely grateful.

0:22:13.340,0:22:14.480
Thank you.

0:22:14.480,0:22:16.480
Amen. We thank God for your life once again, brother.

0:22:16.480,0:22:19.920
Finally, we'd just like to ask: Now that you have received all these wonderful blessings

0:22:19.920,0:22:23.960
from our Lord Jesus Christ, what is your word of advice and encouragement to our viewers?

0:22:23.960,0:22:29.940
Oh my God! Please, people all over the world, stop procrastinating.

0:22:29.940,0:22:32.900
Stop listening to people that are castigating the prophet.

0:22:32.900,0:22:35.000
Please find the means to come here.

0:22:35.000,0:22:36.780
Find a way to come here.

0:22:36.780,0:22:43.660
Solution is here, love is here and you can't find that in most places.

0:22:43.660,0:22:45.960
Please come here and get delivered.

0:22:45.960,0:22:47.680
Come here and meet the Lord.

0:22:47.680,0:22:51.480
Come here - the prophet is waiting for you with arms stretched out

0:22:51.480,0:22:53.760
and with nothing but love in his heart.

0:22:53.760,0:22:58.100
The Lord God Almighty is here, Heaven is already open up over here, waiting for you.

0:22:58.100,0:23:01.040
Stop procrastinating, come here right away.

0:23:01.040,0:23:02.860
The Lord is waiting for you.

0:23:02.860,0:23:04.060
Amen. We thank God for our life.

0:23:04.060,0:23:08.080
Indeed, our brother is encouraging you to seek our Lord Jesus Christ in spirit and truth

0:23:08.080,0:23:10.940
and we believe Jesus will guide everyone to a living church

0:23:10.940,0:23:12.680
where the Holy Spirit will take control of their case.

0:23:12.680,0:23:14.160
Brother, we thank God once again for your life.

0:23:14.160,0:23:17.900
We pray that God will give you the grace to continue making His Word the standard for your life,

0:23:17.900,0:23:21.320
and we are sure you are coming back with even more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.

0:23:21.320,0:23:22.200
Amen.
