The lightening of God moves in the midst of the congregation,

0:00:04.260,0:00:06.700
dispelling all shades of darkness

0:00:06.700,0:00:10.960
through the medium of the Morning Water used by the evangelists

0:00:10.960,0:00:14.100
who have been sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:00:14.100,0:00:19.620
Remember! Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.

0:00:19.620,0:00:23.020
Let us watch as the darkness in the life of this boy

0:00:23.020,0:00:26.980
and his family are dispelled in Jesus' name.

Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:00:28.080,0:00:29.580
Fire!

0:00:29.580,0:00:34.340
Fire, in the name of Jesus! Who are you? Who are you in this body?

0:00:34.340,0:00:39.060
Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:00:39.060,0:00:45.480
Fire, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:45.480,0:00:47.500
Who are you?

0:00:47.500,0:00:51.280
What have you done to him?

0:00:51.280,0:00:53.860
Speak out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:53.860,0:00:57.220
What have you done to his family?

0:00:57.220,0:00:58.620
I destroyed them.

0:00:58.620,0:01:01.000
How did you destroy them?

0:01:01.000,0:01:02.760
My name is Destruction.

0:01:02.760,0:01:08.920
Destruction, how have you destroyed the family?

0:01:08.920,0:01:14.680
How have you destroyed this man?

0:01:14.680,0:01:17.620
Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:17.620,0:01:20.120
I don't allow them to prosper.

0:01:20.120,0:01:24.300
You don't allow them to prosper - how?

0:01:24.300,0:01:26.220
I ruin their businesses.

0:01:26.220,0:01:30.460
You ruin their businesses? What else?

0:01:30.460,0:01:33.445
I close all doors.

0:01:33.445,0:01:38.380
What have you done to his future and his education?

0:01:38.380,0:01:42.260
He's a star.

0:01:42.260,0:01:47.200
But that star belongs to me.

0:01:47.200,0:01:52.700
Look here!

0:01:52.700,0:01:55.580
Who are these people here?

0:01:55.580,0:01:59.940
Who are these people next to you?

0:01:59.940,0:02:02.700
The aunty.

0:02:02.700,0:02:07.180
Madam, you are very welcome.

0:02:07.180,0:02:09.040
Who is he to you?

0:02:09.040,0:02:10.200
He's my nephew.

0:02:10.200,0:02:11.000
He is your nephew?

0:02:11.000,0:02:11.600
Yes.

0:02:11.600,0:02:15.300
What can you say about his behaviour?

0:02:15.300,0:02:17.800
There is no progress in the family.

0:02:17.800,0:02:20.100
He stopped going to school.

0:02:20.100,0:02:22.340
He will tell them he's going to school.

0:02:22.340,0:02:25.940
He took the school fees and ate them.

0:02:25.940,0:02:29.660
He would say he was going and go to his friend's house and stay there.

0:02:29.660,0:02:31.200
He did't take his exams.

0:02:31.200,0:02:34.295
He collected money for assignments but didn't do the assignments.

0:02:34.300,0:02:37.280
He will come and tell us that he went to school.

0:02:37.280,0:02:39.080
Somebody from the school called.

0:02:39.080,0:02:43.280
"Do you know that Jeffery has not been coming to school? Is there any problem?"

0:02:43.280,0:02:44.780
We were all shocked.

0:02:44.780,0:02:49.900
I had to take it upon myself to go to school and found out that he was never in school.

0:02:49.900,0:02:55.160
When we asked him, he told us that he was going to his friend's house to smoke

0:02:55.160,0:02:59.420
and that he used the money to gamble.

0:02:59.420,0:03:03.820
His father's business locked up; there was no progress in the family.

0:03:03.820,0:03:05.440
Today is our happiest day.

0:03:05.440,0:03:13.080
I just bless God for helping me bring him to church today.

0:03:13.080,0:03:19.680
He came; I am so happy that God visited our family.

0:03:19.680,0:03:21.820
Amen! We thank God.

0:03:21.820,0:03:24.720
So, who is he to you?

0:03:24.720,0:03:25.700
He is my cousin.

0:03:25.700,0:03:35.100
My aunty has said it all; he has all the addictions - smoking, drinking, the school issues.

0:03:35.100,0:03:36.760
She has said it all.

0:03:36.760,0:03:39.515
We see that it is just the evil spirit inside him.

0:03:39.520,0:03:41.960
Ministration Of The Morning Water In Jesus' Name

0:03:41.960,0:03:44.800
Fire, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:44.800,0:03:51.020
Speak out! How many of you are inside this body?

0:03:51.020,0:03:55.280
How many of you demons are inside this body?

0:03:55.280,0:03:59.260
Fire, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:59.260,0:04:00.860
How many?

0:04:00.860,0:04:02.300
We are many.

0:04:02.300,0:04:05.180
Who is the second person?

0:04:05.180,0:04:09.480
Confusion.

0:04:09.480,0:04:13.440
How have you, Confusion, affected his education?

0:04:13.440,0:04:22.820
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:04:22.820,0:04:26.160
You demon, how did you enter him?

0:04:26.160,0:04:28.940
Through friends.

0:04:28.940,0:04:33.000
What was he doing with his friends that allowed you to enter?

0:04:33.000,0:04:35.900
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:04:35.900,0:04:39.340
He liked to party.

0:04:39.340,0:04:44.120
What did they use to do at those parties?

0:04:44.120,0:04:47.960
They drink, smoke and do all sorts of evil.

0:04:47.960,0:04:58.060
When he smokes and drinks, what happens to him?

0:04:58.060,0:05:01.500
Everything goes to his head.

0:05:01.500,0:05:06.760
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:05:06.760,0:05:11.220
Right now, through this medium of the Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:05:11.220,0:05:15.220
it's time for you to go, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:15.220,0:05:18.300
You are free, in Jesus' name.

0:05:18.300,0:05:20.280
Thank You, Lord.

0:05:20.280,0:05:25.140
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:05:25.140,0:05:26.820
Rise up.

0:05:26.820,0:05:31.480
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:05:31.480,0:05:34.280
Congratulations, the Lord has set you free.

0:05:34.280,0:05:39.460
Thank You, Jesus!

0:05:39.460,0:05:45.500
Thank You, Jesus! We are grateful. My family is grateful. Thank You.

0:05:45.500,0:05:48.500
We thank God Almighty, but we know that it was the evil spirit

0:05:48.500,0:05:51.800
that was causing him to do all this smoking and drinking.

0:05:51.800,0:05:55.840
So we advice you, sir, make the Bible the standard for your life

0:05:55.840,0:06:00.400
so that you would be able to maintain this deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:06:00.400,0:06:03.800
In Jesus' Name!

0:06:03.800,0:06:06.420
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:06.420,0:06:11.020
Fire!

0:06:11.020,0:06:13.020
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:13.020,0:06:15.580
So right now, through this medium of the Morning Water,

0:06:15.580,0:06:19.280
you demons, it is time for you to go, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:19.280,0:06:24.140
Out, in Jesus Christ' name!

0:06:24.140,0:06:27.920
You are free, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:06:27.920,0:06:29.980
Deliverance In Jesus' Name Through Ministration Of The Morning Water

Thank You, Jesus! I'm free, in Jesus' name!

0:06:51.400,0:06:55.460
TESTIMONY TIME

0:06:55.460,0:06:58.460
My name is Jeffery.

0:06:58.460,0:07:08.460
Besides me are my father, my mum and my aunty.

0:07:08.460,0:07:11.220
Jeffery & Family - Nigeria

0:07:11.220,0:07:13.400
Go ahead with your testimony.

0:07:13.400,0:07:19.560
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:19.560,0:07:26.980
My testimony goes like this.

0:07:26.980,0:07:37.020
When I was 18 years of age, I went to my friend's house and he asked me if I was hungry.

0:07:37.020,0:07:43.140
I gave him money to buy noodles which he prepared.

0:07:43.140,0:07:50.080
Inside the noodles, I saw this green leaf - it was very long; I wondered what it was.

0:07:50.080,0:07:53.280
He said that it was just thyme.

0:07:53.280,0:07:57.520
I thought it was fine since we were all going to eat the food together.

0:07:57.520,0:08:02.700
Then, we started eating the food and I noticed that I was acting strangely.

0:08:02.700,0:08:09.700
I took it as nothing because we were all feeling the same way.

0:08:09.700,0:08:14.980
I asked him what he had put in the food and he replied it was just thyme,

0:08:14.980,0:08:18.020
that I should just eat and be happy.

0:08:18.020,0:08:24.260
It got to a point where it was too much for me - my head felt very light.

0:08:24.260,0:08:29.160
Then, he said it was time for me to go home. He took me to the house.

0:08:29.160,0:08:33.740
On my way, we branched to the pharmacy and he got me a particular medication

0:08:33.740,0:08:37.840
used to clear your eyes when you are very high, when your eyes are very red

0:08:37.840,0:08:40.400
so that people wouldn't know you were high.

0:08:40.400,0:08:47.200
You could just act all cool and stay calm.

0:08:47.200,0:08:55.080
After all that, the next day, I met him again and asked, "Can I get an upgrade?

0:08:55.080,0:08:59.900
Instead of eating it, could I do something else with it?"

0:08:59.900,0:09:03.020
He said, "Sure I could smoke it."

0:09:03.020,0:09:09.900
He showed me how to roll the weed and I started smoking it from then until I entered university.

0:09:09.900,0:09:13.160
While in university, I met some friends.

0:09:13.160,0:09:21.740
They told me that they smoked, drank and did drugs and asked me what I did.

0:09:21.740,0:09:29.340
I said I just smoked and they said it was fine and that we should smoke together.

0:09:29.340,0:09:33.700
We left lectures, went to the back of the school and started smoking.

0:09:33.700,0:09:40.800
Then, a brother ordered drugs and I started taking painkillers from then.

0:09:40.800,0:09:47.380
After the painkillers, they introduced me to cocaine but I refused to take it,

0:09:47.380,0:09:50.760
codeine and other stuff.

0:09:50.760,0:09:53.500
All this happened while I was in university.

0:09:53.500,0:09:57.460
With this, I stopped going to school and I started looking for money to buy drugs

0:09:57.460,0:10:02.220
because I needed drugs to stay high and focused.

0:10:02.220,0:10:06.500
I had been deceived that I was taking drugs to get focused.

0:10:06.500,0:10:13.900
It is a big deceit because you cannot achieve what you want to achieve when you are high.

0:10:13.900,0:10:17.900
It is not possible because it wastes your time.

0:10:17.900,0:10:26.660
Once you decided, "I will smoke today", that was all. I would get high and life continued.

0:10:26.660,0:10:28.680
I smoked every day.

0:10:28.680,0:10:31.540
In the morning, when I woke up, I smoked.

0:10:31.540,0:10:34.220
I would take a bath. Then, after food, I would smoke.

0:10:34.220,0:10:36.620
In the afternoon, I would smoke.

0:10:36.620,0:10:39.420
Every single day, before going to school, I smoked;

0:10:39.420,0:10:42.140
I always got high before I went for lectures.

0:10:42.140,0:10:46.095
During the lectures, it was either I was sleeping or chatting with my friends.

0:10:46.100,0:10:48.900
I just focused away from my schooling.

0:10:48.900,0:10:52.120
With that, I started stealing.

0:10:52.120,0:10:58.480
I started stealing my parents' stuff and selling things from the house like my parents' jewellery.

0:10:58.480,0:11:03.940
I started taking what was not mine just to buy drugs and get high.

0:11:03.940,0:11:07.300
It was something that I could not stop.

0:11:07.300,0:11:10.960
I was looking for a better way of stealing.

0:11:10.960,0:11:18.540
I met this friend of mine who told me that he could help me join a cult.

0:11:18.540,0:11:25.340
I would get boys who would be at my back and I would be under them for protection.

0:11:25.340,0:11:32.800
I told the guy that I was not sure about it and wanted to think about it for a while.

0:11:32.800,0:11:38.400
He kept on asking me that question but I would always dodge him,

0:11:38.400,0:11:42.400
to the extent that I stopped going to the guy's place but each time he saw me on the road,

0:11:42.400,0:11:49.520
he would ask me what my answer was to what we had talked about.

0:11:49.520,0:11:56.040
I would tell him that I was still thinking about it, that the next time we met I would talk about it.

0:11:56.040,0:12:04.080
I felt that being in a cult was not really necessary because I had my parents.

0:12:04.080,0:12:06.900
Fine, they might say I was too soft or something.

0:12:06.900,0:12:11.920
I could just stay on my own without being in a cult, going for robberies

0:12:11.920,0:12:15.120
or doing whatever they did.

0:12:15.120,0:12:17.340
I avoided the guy.

0:12:17.340,0:12:28.400
The spirit brought in confusion and made me do away with my school fees.

0:12:28.400,0:12:39.640
It made me destroy my parents' business and took away the glory of the family.

0:12:39.640,0:12:49.740
I went for parties where we would scam people over the internet.

0:12:49.740,0:12:55.800
Actually, the spirit made me to hate school and everything about reading.

0:12:55.800,0:12:58.840
I never saw myself reading; I was not the reading type.

0:12:58.840,0:13:03.680
I just didn't like school.

0:13:03.680,0:13:11.600
Now, tell us how you finally came to The SCOAN for your deliverance.

0:13:11.600,0:13:19.280
After watching Emmanuel TV for a long while, I was very close to my aunt and I told her

0:13:19.280,0:13:27.560
how I had been seeing people being delivered on Emmanuel TV and I needed deliverance too.

0:13:27.560,0:13:32.780
That morning, I was begging her although I don't like going to church,

0:13:32.780,0:13:37.840
I begged her to take me to church. She said fine and that I should dress up.

0:13:37.840,0:13:41.140
Then, she brought me here.

0:13:41.140,0:13:49.240
While the Morning Water was being ministered, I wasn't myself.

0:13:49.240,0:13:56.140
I got lost in a trance.

0:13:56.140,0:14:01.940
After your deliverance, what can you say about your new life?

0:14:01.940,0:14:06.140
My life has been peaceful ever since.

0:14:06.140,0:14:08.900
I don't smoke anymore.

0:14:08.900,0:14:13.020
I don't have the urge to take drugs anymore.

0:14:13.020,0:14:16.180
I am just happy with myself.

0:14:16.180,0:14:19.380
I just feel good right now.

0:14:19.380,0:14:22.020
Thanks to God, I am happy that I am delivered.

0:14:22.020,0:14:25.080
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.

0:14:25.080,0:14:29.600
Jeffery & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:14:29.600,0:14:36.460
We would like to listen to your parents. Let's hear from your dad.

0:14:36.460,0:14:42.075
Sir, tell us your name and whom the young man is to you

0:14:42.080,0:14:46.020
and what you have to say concerning his previous character.

0:14:46.020,0:14:49.700
Emmanuel!! - (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:14:49.700,0:14:53.020
My name is Emmanuel.

0:14:53.020,0:14:58.800
The boy standing here is my son, Jeffery.

0:14:58.800,0:15:04.340
Jeffery used to be a very brilliant son of mine.

0:15:04.340,0:15:10.540
All this began when he entered into the final year of secondary school.

0:15:10.540,0:15:17.600
A boy that is inclined scientifically, does a lot of things with computers and telephones.

0:15:17.600,0:15:23.120
Most of the time, when I have issues to do with my laptop

0:15:23.120,0:15:28.440
or anything that has to do with computers, what I do is call him to put me through.

0:15:28.440,0:15:32.980
I was just very happy the way he was going but all of a sudden,

0:15:32.980,0:15:38.440
when he wanted to choose the subjects for his final year in secondary school,

0:15:38.440,0:15:45.580
which ought to have been sciences, the boy automatically changed to art subjects.

0:15:45.580,0:15:53.080
I asked him if he had been doing art subjects before and he said no but that he loved doing art.

0:15:53.080,0:15:59.160
He said that art was his desire and that he loved to act and draw -

0:15:59.160,0:16:01.240
that was what he wanted to do.

0:16:01.240,0:16:06.900
I was surprised - a boy who was doing very well in his academics in science subjects,

0:16:06.900,0:16:10.060
all of a sudden decided to change to arts.

0:16:10.060,0:16:15.680
The teachers at his school called me and asked if I was aware of what my son wanted to do.

0:16:15.680,0:16:19.160
I said yes and that I had asked him but one thing that I would never do,

0:16:19.160,0:16:22.440
was to stop him from doing the course that he wanted to do.

0:16:22.440,0:16:25.860
What I would do was just to ask him to confirm that this was what he wanted to do.

0:16:25.860,0:16:27.660
Then, I would back him up.

0:16:27.660,0:16:29.880
That was what I did in that aspect.

0:16:29.880,0:16:32.720
I kept asking questions but he said that was what he wanted to do.

0:16:32.720,0:16:35.040
I told him not to worry, that I would back him up

0:16:35.040,0:16:38.080
and that whatever he did, he should come out to be the best.

0:16:38.080,0:16:40.320
He started out that way.

0:16:40.320,0:16:50.000
When he got admission into university, we asked him to try as much as possible to live on campus

0:16:50.000,0:16:53.120
But unfortunately, he couldn't get accommodation on campus;

0:16:53.120,0:16:55.500
so, he had to come from home.

0:16:55.500,0:16:59.520
Every day, Jeffery would collect money from me to go to school.

0:16:59.520,0:17:02.900
One thing I observed at that time was that he went out every day

0:17:02.900,0:17:07.680
but would come back between 9:30pm - 10:00pm, every day.

0:17:07.680,0:17:10.380
Sometimes, he would sleep and sleep.

0:17:10.380,0:17:13.120
At around 10 o'clock, I would go to his room and asked him if he was still sleeping

0:17:13.120,0:17:15.540
and if he wasn't going to school or having lectures that day.

0:17:15.540,0:17:18.300
He would tell me, "Daddy, my lecture is in the afternoon".

0:17:18.300,0:17:25.160
I would ask why other kids were in school while only he attended class in the afternoon.

0:17:25.160,0:17:29.860
I was a little bit scared and angry with him.

0:17:29.860,0:17:31.440
This continued.

0:17:31.440,0:17:36.720
It was to the extent that one day, I saw him as he came in and his eyes were red.

0:17:36.720,0:17:38.480
I tried to find out what had happened to him.

0:17:38.480,0:17:41.480
He said that he was okay, only that he was having a slight headache

0:17:41.480,0:17:43.520
which was why his eyes were red.

0:17:43.520,0:17:50.560
I prayed with him and told him that whenever he comes back, he should come and see me

0:17:50.560,0:17:53.940
so that I would be able to know exactly what was wrong with him.

0:17:53.940,0:17:58.540
But one thing Jeffery did was never to come back to me at any point in time.

0:17:58.540,0:18:00.700
He tried to keep away from me.

0:18:00.700,0:18:04.200
Whenever he came back so late, he would never bother to come upstairs and see me.

0:18:04.200,0:18:06.360
He would just go to his room and that was it.

0:18:06.360,0:18:11.000
Sometimes, when you put food on the table, Jeffery would not eat.

0:18:11.000,0:18:14.300
The next day, the way you left that food was how it would be.

0:18:14.300,0:18:18.780
I began to ask what the problem was - did he have someone taking care of him in school?

0:18:18.780,0:18:22.660
He would say he was okay, he was fine. That was how Jeffery had been.

0:18:22.660,0:18:28.800
I noticed a lot of changes but the only thing was that he never told the truth.

0:18:28.800,0:18:33.920
At any point in time, when you asked him a question, he had one thing or the other to tell you.

0:18:33.920,0:18:40.840
As a deacon in my church, I always told him that the truth of the matter was that it is good for you

0:18:40.840,0:18:44.820
to be truthful in life so that somebody would be able to help you when you had problems.

0:18:44.820,0:18:50.020
But as a man, when you grow in the life of not telling the truth often,

0:18:50.020,0:18:55.440
nobody will know when you have needs, problems - people will never take you serious.

0:18:55.440,0:18:59.900
That was one thing I tried to minister to him but I found that at any point in time,

0:18:59.900,0:19:08.240
Jeffery kept on telling lies, which is not of God. I always cautioned him.

0:19:08.240,0:19:13.000
But to God be the glory, I was very happy that he was delivered.

0:19:13.000,0:19:18.460
One thing that I want to tell people is that - my son, Jeffery used to be a nice boy.

0:19:18.460,0:19:23.500
Sometimes, when he went out with friends, he didn't even bother to know who his friends were.

0:19:23.500,0:19:27.980
I would say that assuming I had followed him up as a parent,

0:19:27.980,0:19:30.020
I would have known who his friends were.

0:19:30.020,0:19:34.220
It would have been better for him to bring his friends home and let us talk to them

0:19:34.220,0:19:36.180
and know exactly what they were into.

0:19:36.180,0:19:40.080
Some of them might not be the best for him but at least, I would had been able to guide him

0:19:40.080,0:19:43.340
and say, "This friend is not good for you to walk with, do this,

0:19:43.340,0:19:48.020
look for people that have the fear of God so that they can help increase your spiritual life".

0:19:48.020,0:19:52.800
But Jeffery never brought his friends home; his friends were always outside.

0:19:52.800,0:19:55.000
Whenever he wanted to go out, he went out;

0:19:55.000,0:19:57.320
whenever he wanted to come back, he came back.

0:19:57.320,0:20:00.600
Whenever we asked him questions, he went straight to tell us, "I am fine".

0:20:00.600,0:20:03.300
Who are your friends? He will say my friends are there.

0:20:03.300,0:20:08.535
He said, "Daddy, I will never fail you" up 'til today, he had failed the whole family.

0:20:08.540,0:20:12.320
Praise the Lord!

0:20:12.320,0:20:17.260
We thank God for the deliverance your son has received but we just want to ask you,

0:20:17.260,0:20:25.980
there was a time you said that he used to sleep and kept telling you that he had lectures in the afternoon.

0:20:25.980,0:20:33.380
Did you inquire from anybody whether he was actually in school or not?

0:20:33.380,0:20:38.740
Yes. Whenever Jeffery slept and I went to wake him up for school,

0:20:38.740,0:20:44.860
I had people that I thought I had handed Jeffery over to at school to look after him.

0:20:44.860,0:20:47.460
One of them was a lecturer there.

0:20:47.460,0:20:52.940
I said, "Listen, my friend, you are there. I believe as a father, you are there with Jeffery.

0:20:52.940,0:20:56.940
Please, guide Jeffery and teach Jeffery the right thing to do".

0:20:56.940,0:21:01.240
Also, Jeffery's immediate younger sister was at the same school as him.

0:21:01.240,0:21:04.940
That one was always very serious and never came home.

0:21:04.940,0:21:11.220
With Jeffery, I had tried as much as possible to give him a reason to stay in school and read.

0:21:11.220,0:21:13.200
He preferred to come from the house.

0:21:13.200,0:21:19.600
Every morning I go out to my business and come back as late as six or seven in the evening.

0:21:19.600,0:21:21.700
By then, he would have gone out to school.

0:21:21.700,0:21:26.580
I was not monitoring him the way I ought to have because every morning, I go out for my business.

0:21:26.580,0:21:30.180
He too, pretended to go to school, but he never did.

0:21:30.180,0:21:32.200
That was the problem.

0:21:32.200,0:21:40.240
Also, sir, did you ask how he was doing in school from those people you handed him over to?

0:21:40.240,0:21:43.780
Sometimes when I asked him, he said Jeffery was doing well.

0:21:43.780,0:21:48.080
Also, his sister always told me that Jeffery was fine but that the only thing was that

0:21:48.080,0:21:51.960
his friends were complaining that Jeffery did not attend lectures.

0:21:51.960,0:21:55.755
That was when we knew that things had got so bad.

0:21:55.760,0:21:59.800
When I asked Jeffery if he went to school, he would say that he went to school.

0:21:59.800,0:22:02.760
I would ask, "How was school?" He would say that it was beautiful, fine.

0:22:02.760,0:22:05.220
I would ask him where his books were.

0:22:05.220,0:22:08.400
At least, somebody who went to school was supposed to have handouts,

0:22:08.400,0:22:10.460
textbooks and other reading materials.

0:22:10.460,0:22:11.980
Jeffery never read.

0:22:11.980,0:22:15.240
At any point in time, when you asked him a question, he would say, "Daddy, don't worry.

0:22:15.240,0:22:20.840
This is a scientific world now; everything is on the systems. We go to the systems to read"

0:22:20.840,0:22:22.560
and he said that he was going to make it better.

0:22:22.560,0:22:27.940
Up until now, he did not read his books but I thank God that since his deliverance,

0:22:27.940,0:22:32.560
Jeffery stays at home instead of always going out.

0:22:32.560,0:22:35.240
I went to him and asked, "Jeffery, what do you want to do?"

0:22:35.240,0:22:38.320
He would say, "Daddy, I want to relax or look at one thing or the other".

0:22:38.320,0:22:43.320
This makes me so happy now.

0:22:43.320,0:22:44.500
To God be the glory.

0:22:44.500,0:22:52.340
We just want to hear from you, sir, what effort have you made to find a solution to the problem of your son?

0:22:52.340,0:23:00.740
As a deacon in my church, I mostly have pastors as my friends.

0:23:00.740,0:23:04.320
Most of the time, some of them come to the house to pray for us.

0:23:04.320,0:23:07.380
Whenever we needed them, they always came.

0:23:07.380,0:23:10.620
They always told me that Jeffery had an issue, a problem

0:23:10.620,0:23:15.100
but no one could really tell what it was.

0:23:15.100,0:23:18.280
I took it up myself and fasted most of the time.

0:23:18.280,0:23:24.180
Even the week that he came for deliverance, I was fasting for five days because of him.

0:23:24.180,0:23:27.640
I had tried all that I could to make this boy change.

0:23:27.640,0:23:32.140
When I prayed, he didn't even seem to understand why one should pray.

0:23:32.140,0:23:37.820
Sometimes, I called him to come but to him, it seemed I was a time waster.

0:23:37.820,0:23:40.300
To him, being in the presence of God was time wasting.

0:23:40.300,0:23:42.380
Jeffery never even followed me.

0:23:42.380,0:23:46.160
Whenever I called him to come to church, what he would do was to run to the toilet.

0:23:46.160,0:23:49.400
He would either tell me that he was stooling, his tummy was disturbing him.

0:23:49.400,0:23:54.080
He would stay there; I would sound my car horn and shout but he would never come out.

0:23:54.080,0:23:56.300
Out of annoyance, I would leave him and go to church.

0:23:56.300,0:24:01.740
And finally, he came to The SCOAN.

0:24:01.740,0:24:09.300
By the grace of God, he was delivered from this spirit that gave him several bad habits.

0:24:09.300,0:24:15.880
What changes have you noticed ever since he received deliverance here at The SCOAN?

0:24:15.880,0:24:17.300
Praise the Lord!

0:24:17.300,0:24:21.580
Since Jeffery came for deliverance, his life has totally changed.

0:24:21.580,0:24:28.780
One thing I noticed was this: Jeffery never woke up early to do the things he ought to do

0:24:28.780,0:24:31.480
without me forcing him.

0:24:31.480,0:24:34.640
Since his deliverance, when he wakes up, he goes straight to the parlour,

0:24:34.640,0:24:38.820
opens the windows and sweeps.

0:24:38.820,0:24:43.540
He goes to the cars, even the ones I don't want to use, and washes them for me,

0:24:43.540,0:24:45.180
which he had never done.

0:24:45.180,0:24:49.340
As old as Jeffery is, one always had to tell him, "Do this", before he did something

0:24:49.340,0:24:50.580
at any point in time.

0:24:50.580,0:24:54.740
He never took the initiative to do something on his own.

0:24:54.740,0:24:58.800
Since his deliverance, he has been so calm; he stays at home

0:24:58.800,0:25:01.115
and has not been going out for a few days now.

0:25:01.120,0:25:02.960
Things have really changed.

0:25:02.960,0:25:10.740
When I speak with him, the way he responds to the questions tells me that

0:25:10.740,0:25:13.120
something has happened in his life.

0:25:13.120,0:25:14.380
Praise the Lord!

0:25:14.380,0:25:16.945
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.

0:25:16.945,0:25:19.640
Emmanuel & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:25:19.640,0:25:23.520
How is his prayer life now?

0:25:23.520,0:25:28.280
Previously, when I called Jeffery to get up to pray and do our morning devotion,

0:25:28.280,0:25:31.580
everybody would be out but Jeffery would not join us.

0:25:31.580,0:25:37.580
But now, when we just start upstairs - he is downstairs - when he hears my voice,

0:25:37.580,0:25:40.180
he wakes up by himself and joins us in prayer.

0:25:40.180,0:25:43.520
Now, he is more focused.

0:25:43.520,0:25:46.440
I have heard him pray out loud but before, he could not.

0:25:46.440,0:25:50.135
When you asked him to pray, he would just be murmuring.

0:25:50.140,0:25:51.860
I would say, "What are you murmuring?

0:25:51.860,0:25:56.315
Why not voice out and let me hear what you are saying? Pray out so that we can hear you well".

0:25:56.320,0:25:59.040
But then, he didn't do that and you could not force him.

0:25:59.040,0:26:02.860
Whatever you asked him to do, he would choose to do what he wanted.

0:26:02.860,0:26:07.060
But now, he prays out loud and I have heard him praising God,

0:26:07.060,0:26:09.820
singing to praise and worship His holy name.

0:26:09.820,0:26:10.740
Praise the name of the Lord!

0:26:22.480,0:26:24.220
and this testimony.

0:26:24.220,0:26:29.400
Madam, tell us your name and who the brother is to you

0:26:29.400,0:26:31.080
and what you have to say.

0:26:31.080,0:26:33.840
My name is Phillipias.

0:26:33.840,0:26:36.915

What can you say about his deliverance?

0:26:43.680,0:26:50.960
I thank God that after his deliverance, my son is calm. His character has changed.

0:26:50.960,0:26:53.460
He is always indoors; he's not going outside.

We also want to hear from the aunty that brought Jeffery here for deliverance.

0:27:12.320,0:27:16.915
Sister, ever since he received deliverance, I believe you have seen

0:27:16.920,0:27:19.580
one or two changes in his life.

0:27:19.580,0:27:22.460
Tell us what you can say about Jeffery now.

My name is Promise.

0:27:27.400,0:27:32.940
Looking at Jeffery now, he looks fresh. That is one of the things.

0:27:32.940,0:27:38.800
Unlike when he was dry and I kept asking what was drying him up.

0:27:38.800,0:27:44.340
You would see those veins; they would just shoot out like that.

0:27:44.340,0:27:50.660
He would always frown his face but now, he is happy.

0:27:50.660,0:27:55.860
He said, "Aunty, God has visited me" and God has visited him.

0:27:55.860,0:27:57.680
Praise God!

0:27:57.680,0:28:02.900
Indeed, God has visited this family and to God be the glory

0:28:02.900,0:28:06.520
they are here to share the wonderful testimony of the power of God

0:28:06.520,0:28:08.220
through this medium of Morning Water.

0:28:08.220,0:28:13.120
We just want to hear your advice to viewers.

0:28:13.120,0:28:15.360
We would start with the father first.

0:28:15.360,0:28:19.780
Sir, tell us the advice you have for viewers all over the world.

0:28:19.780,0:28:23.520
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:28:23.520,0:28:28.720
The advice I have for viewers watching us this morning -

0:28:28.720,0:28:33.300
I would say that it is not all just about having children

0:28:33.300,0:28:37.320
but I would advise every parent to create time for their children.

0:28:37.320,0:28:42.620
Monitor them, who their friends are, know how they move.

0:28:42.620,0:28:45.280
Don't only send them to school and say, "Yes, I have paid their school fees,

0:28:45.280,0:28:48.080
I have given them all they required".

0:28:48.080,0:28:54.040
You, as a father, you, as a mother have to create time to visit them and know what they are doing -

0:28:54.040,0:28:59.900
Whether they are really attending lectures and still doing that which they ought to do.

0:28:59.900,0:29:07.600
Most especially, as children of God, parents who were brought up in the Christian way,

0:29:07.600,0:29:14.960
try to make sure that your ward belongs to a Christian fellowship on campus.

0:29:14.960,0:29:17.740
That is the only thing that will help them in life.

0:29:17.740,0:29:24.040
I can remember when I was in university, I had my prayer groups

0:29:24.040,0:29:28.120
and every day, we were involved in one programme or the other.

0:29:28.120,0:29:29.640
But these children never do that.

0:29:29.640,0:29:33.460
The duty of parents is this: make sure you monitor your ward,

0:29:33.460,0:29:36.980
make sure you know whom their friends are, interview their friends,

0:29:36.980,0:29:43.080
know the quality of friends they have, even the ones you can ascertain that this one is good,

0:29:43.080,0:29:47.280
make sure you know the background of that friend so if anything goes wrong,

0:29:47.280,0:29:49.000
you know where to start from.

0:29:49.000,0:29:51.860
I think their friends are very paramount.

0:29:51.860,0:29:57.220
Please, parents, be watchful whom your children are friends with.

0:29:57.220,0:29:58.700
Praise the Lord!

0:29:58.700,0:30:01.440
Hallelujah! Viewers all over the world, you have heard it.

0:30:01.440,0:30:04.120
We also want to hear from Jeffery himself.

0:30:04.120,0:30:11.480
What advice do you have for viewers, particularly to youths who have the same habit

0:30:11.480,0:30:14.340
you had in the past.

0:30:14.340,0:30:18.540
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:30:18.540,0:30:25.920
My advice for the youth all over the world, having the same problem that I had

0:30:25.920,0:30:29.600
is to watch the kind of friends you keep.

0:30:29.600,0:30:34.620
There is a saying that show me your friends and I will tell you who you are.

0:30:34.620,0:30:36.520
It is so true.

0:30:36.520,0:30:42.880
You just have to watch the kind of friends you keep and the kind of movements you make.

0:30:42.880,0:30:47.780
It is not all friends who tell you something is good that is actually good;

0:30:47.780,0:30:49.380
they are there to deceive you.

0:30:49.380,0:30:54.560
The devil is real and he wants us  to go down;

0:30:54.560,0:30:57.320
he doesn't want us to shine the way God wants us to shine.

0:30:57.320,0:31:04.380
My advice for you is believe in God because right now,

0:31:04.380,0:31:08.180
I am really happy being in the presence of the Lord.

0:31:08.180,0:31:12.260
I feel really...

0:31:12.260,0:31:15.480
Jeffery & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:31:15.480,0:31:21.500
Words are not enough for him to explain how he is actually feeling right now.

0:31:21.500,0:31:27.160
So we thank God that God Almighty has used this medium of Morning Water to set you free.

0:31:27.160,0:31:32.060
The advice from Prophet T.B. Joshua is that you and your family

0:31:32.060,0:31:36.560
should go and make God's Word the standard for your lives

0:31:36.560,0:31:43.920
so that this kind of deliverance would remain permanent in your lives in Jesus' name.

0:31:43.920,0:31:44.880
Amen.
