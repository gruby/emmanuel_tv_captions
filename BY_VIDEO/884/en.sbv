Prophet T.B. Joshua's Arrival In The Nation Of Paraguay

0:06:26.480,0:06:34.660
One of the top prestigious newspapers in Paraguay, on Thursday, the 10th of August 2017

0:06:34.660,0:06:38.560
featured Prophet T.B. Joshua in their article titled,

0:06:38.560,0:06:46.740
"Nigerian Preacher, TB Joshua, Awarded Paraguay's Highest Honour – The National Order Of Merit"

0:06:46.740,0:06:54.800
The national Parliament of Paraguay has concurred to grant the "Comuneros" National Order of Merit

0:06:54.800,0:06:58.420
to Nigerian Prophet TB Joshua.

0:06:58.420,0:07:06.380
This was decided August 9th 2017, at the sitting of Parliament in Asuncion,

0:07:06.380,0:07:11.640
according to 970 AM Radio journalist, Nativida Romero.

0:07:11.640,0:07:16.700
Member of Parliament Bernardo Villalba (ANR) proposed

0:07:16.700,0:07:23.300
that the spiritual leader, Temitope Balogun Joshua, receive the highest distinction

0:07:23.300,0:07:25.480
the Parliament can bestow.

0:07:25.480,0:07:29.760
The legislator's proposal was fully approved.

0:07:29.760,0:07:38.660
Avanze Pais MP, Rocio Casco, did however oppose it on the ground that the distinction had previously

0:07:38.660,0:07:42.320
only been awarded to citizens of the country.

0:07:42.320,0:07:47.560
For his part, the legislator Villalba maintained his position.

0:07:47.560,0:07:54.420
Villalba put forward his arguments, in full session, where he expressed that Joshua,

0:07:54.420,0:08:01.100
compelled to visit Paraguay, "will bring peace and blessing to the population."

0:08:01.100,0:08:10.380
"I do not just want to welcome him to our country. We pray his stay be as fruitful as possible and that it will be

0:08:10.380,0:08:13.000
a blessing to our nation.

0:08:13.000,0:08:22.100
For the first time ever, I propose the National Order to be awarded to a personality and I am proposing that

0:08:22.100,0:08:28.980
he be awarded this distinction by the Members of Parliament," said Villalba.

0:08:28.980,0:08:36.600
Villalba solicited the preacher be presented the national honour at the Defensores del Chaco Stadium,

0:08:36.600,0:08:39.340
where he will host the crusade.
