0:00:00.880,0:00:02.980
You are a minister of God.

0:00:02.980,0:00:04.960
Yes, Prophet.

0:00:04.960,0:00:08.680
Don't give up.

0:00:08.680,0:00:11.280
God loves you, please.

0:00:11.280,0:00:18.380
I know you are facing so much, what you are facing is not even persecution;

0:00:18.380,0:00:32.900
it's destruction and has given you a name that you use evil powers.

0:00:32.960,0:00:40.860
Don't give up because you are in between to leave the ministry and rest.

0:00:40.860,0:00:48.200
Yes, Prophet.

0:00:48.260,0:00:50.020
Between to leave the ministry...

0:00:50.020,0:00:53.580
You have branches in many places but you are in between saying,

0:00:53.580,0:00:58.900
"I want to handover for somebody to continue, I want to leave the ministry."

0:00:58.900,0:00:59.780
Yes, Prophet.

0:00:59.780,0:01:04.420
You think you have gotten to the cross-roads, left for you, this is the way you see the whole thing.

0:01:04.420,0:01:05.820
Don't give up, sir.

0:01:05.820,0:01:06.880
Yes, Prophet.

0:01:06.880,0:01:11.580
What is the cause of these thoughts?

0:01:11.580,0:01:16.340
The cause of the thoughts is that I have ministers under me.

0:01:16.340,0:01:22.660
In December, three ministers fell into the river when they were baptising converts and they died.

0:01:22.660,0:01:23.560
In your ministry?

0:01:23.560,0:01:29.340
In my ministry and then the people said that I bewitched those ministers.

0:01:29.340,0:01:33.180
That you are the one who killed them, that you used evil powers?

0:01:33.180,0:01:35.740
Yes.

0:01:35.740,0:01:42.000
This man is a man of God, the trouble just came like that.

0:01:42.000,0:01:46.620
He is not using evil powers.

0:01:46.620,0:01:50.320
It's all right.

0:01:50.320,0:01:52.160
He is not using evil powers.

0:01:52.160,0:01:58.240
It's all right.

0:01:58.240,0:02:01.180
While the prayer was going on, I saw someone across -

0:02:01.180,0:02:07.440
"This man wants to leave the ministry, the ministry you have been right from young age and you have been

0:02:07.440,0:02:12.240
the minister of God, God has planted the ministry into many places."

0:02:12.240,0:02:13.880
They say they will kill me.

0:02:13.880,0:02:14.760
They said they would kill you?

0:02:14.760,0:02:20.800
Yes, Prophet.

0:02:20.820,0:02:22.000
OK, it's all right.

0:02:22.000,0:02:24.340
We will discuss that. 
No problem.

0:02:24.340,0:02:31.800
I'm seeing you as a minister of God, nobody can kill you.

0:02:31.800,0:02:37.920
There is no trace of evil in you.

0:02:37.920,0:02:42.160
They went from baptism and the three of them fell inside the river and died.

0:02:42.160,0:02:48.620
Three ministers of God and they said you are a wizard.

0:02:48.620,0:02:49.540
Are you the wife?

0:02:49.540,0:02:59.400
Yes, sir, I'm the wife.
I praise God for delivering him.

0:02:59.420,0:03:06.600
I am Archbishop Andrew Ndubano from Botswana.

0:03:06.600,0:03:10.660
I belong to the St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission of Botswana.

0:03:10.660,0:03:15.540
The lady standing next to me is my wife.

0:03:15.540,0:03:23.300
What is your name?

0:03:23.340,0:03:29.640
I'm a Lady Archbishop of St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission of Botswana.

0:03:29.640,0:03:31.060
You are welcome in Jesus' name.

0:03:31.060,0:03:37.340
Can you tell us what was the message of prophecy given to you today by Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:03:37.340,0:03:45.320
I am in Lagos, Nigeria at the SCOAN.

0:03:45.320,0:03:48.300
Today is my day.

0:03:48.300,0:03:51.460
I have been very much amazed.

0:03:51.460,0:03:55.840
The prophet has been going around, picking out people and prophesying to them.

0:03:55.840,0:04:05.300
But to my greatest dismay, he came to me, held my hand and said, "You are a man of God,

0:04:05.300,0:04:10.360
you have a ministry. Now you are facing destruction

0:04:10.360,0:04:16.040
whom they labelled that you have killed the three ministers."

0:04:16.040,0:04:18.200
You are a minister of God.

0:04:18.200,0:04:20.200
Yes, Prophet.

0:04:20.200,0:04:23.900
Don't give up.

0:04:23.900,0:04:26.480
God loves you, please.

0:04:26.480,0:04:33.580
I know you are facing so much, what you are facing is not even persecution;

0:04:33.580,0:04:43.280
it's a destruction and that has given you a name that you used evil powers.

0:04:43.280,0:04:52.320
"I am declaring that you are innocent and there is nothing to bother you, or to worry you

0:04:52.320,0:04:55.800
as you have the intention of leaving the church."

0:04:55.800,0:05:03.700
Don't give up because you are in between to leave the ministry and rest.

0:05:03.700,0:05:08.740
Yes, Prophet.

0:05:08.740,0:05:14.920
This man is a man of God, the trouble just came like that.

0:05:14.920,0:05:19.600
He is not using evil powers.

0:05:19.600,0:05:22.580
It's all right.

0:05:22.580,0:05:31.840
What happened is that one of the branches with its own ministers decided to go and baptize

0:05:31.840,0:05:33.860
people on that particular date.

0:05:33.860,0:05:42.400
I was not informed of the day of the baptism; I only got a shock when I was phoned that I had bewitched

0:05:42.400,0:05:47.940
the three ministers that had drowned.

0:05:47.940,0:05:52.620
I had no knowledge of what could have happened.

0:05:52.620,0:05:55.200
The prophecy is excellent.

0:05:55.200,0:05:56.240
We thank God.

0:05:56.240,0:06:00.640
Finally, what decision are you going to take now after this prophecy?

0:06:00.640,0:06:12.240
After the prophecy, that the prophet proved beyond reasonable doubt and proving that I'm innocent...

0:06:12.240,0:06:17.620
He prophesied that I wanted to abandon my church

0:06:17.620,0:06:22.540
and now I'm not going to abandon the ministry as I started it.

0:06:22.540,0:06:27.560
I am now strengthened by the prophecy of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:06:27.560,0:06:31.260
I am going to stay in the church until I die.

0:06:31.260,0:06:31.920
Hallelujah!

0:06:31.920,0:06:34.920
We thank you so much for this wonderful confirmation of the prophecy.

0:06:34.920,0:06:40.060
We give thanks to God for your life and for your ministry and we pray that God will give you that grace

0:06:40.060,0:06:44.220
to make His word the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.

0:06:44.220,0:06:45.840
Amen.

0:06:45.840,0:06:48.160
Glory be to Jesus.
