Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Prophecy In Jesus' Name

0:00:12.860,0:00:17.620
Come on. There is a challenge you are facing. You should learn to forgive.

0:00:17.620,0:00:23.680
Forgive this man because this is what is affecting your son.

0:00:23.680,0:00:27.340
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:27.340,0:00:31.060
Acting on the prophetic word, the following Sunday,

0:00:31.060,0:00:35.580
the woman returned to The SCOAN with her son

0:00:35.580,0:00:39.980
whom the prophecy had revealed had been negatively affected.

0:00:39.980,0:00:43.400
As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministered prayer to the congregation,

0:00:43.400,0:00:49.080
the power of the Holy Spirit tore down the kingdom of satan and set the captives free.

0:00:49.080,0:00:51.720
During the prayer, the woman who received the prophecy

0:00:51.720,0:00:55.000
cried out for God's mercy to speak for her son.

0:00:55.000,0:01:00.460
Man of God, he is an armed robber. Man of God, please help me.

0:01:00.460,0:01:03.380
Man of God, help me. He is an armed robber.

0:01:03.380,0:01:07.660
Man of God, help me deliver my son. He is a fraudster. He is into everything.

0:01:07.660,0:01:10.940
He refused to go to school. Man of God, help me.

0:01:10.940,0:01:14.200
He is addicted to drugs. Man of God, help me.

0:01:14.200,0:01:17.880
He is delivered in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:01:17.880,0:01:22.640
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:22.640,0:01:26.920
My name is Mrs Eno Ekanem.

0:01:26.920,0:01:30.460
The person standing next to
 me is my son Emmanuel Ekanem.

0:01:30.460,0:01:34.380
He's 27 years old.

0:01:34.380,0:01:41.980
Two Sundays ago, the man of God walked up to me and prophesied

0:01:41.980,0:01:47.900
that I had a challenge, that I 
should forgive this man.

0:01:47.900,0:01:52.980
That that was the cause of 
the problem I have with my son.

0:01:52.980,0:01:58.440
This man happens to be my husband for over 35 years.

0:01:58.440,0:02:05.480
Emmanuel is the last of four children.
He is the last.

0:02:05.480,0:02:10.840
Emmanuel has given us so much pain.

0:02:10.840,0:02:16.380
Emmanuel has been a child that
we wished he should have died

0:02:16.380,0:02:19.780
so that the family can have peace,

0:02:19.780,0:02:24.040
so that the family's name will not be in the mud.

0:02:24.040,0:02:27.780
The man in question is my husband

0:02:27.780,0:02:33.020
but he never played the role of a 
father to them.

0:02:33.020,0:02:37.920
He sort of allowed everything to be on my shoulders.

0:02:37.920,0:02:41.260
The man of God actually saw my heart

0:02:41.260,0:02:47.060
because I have been pained, I've been living in pain.

0:02:47.060,0:02:49.760
He hurt me so much.

0:02:49.760,0:02:56.020
After the prophecy on that Sunday,
I was contemplating on calling him

0:02:56.020,0:02:58.720
because we had not seen him for a very long time,

0:02:58.720,0:03:02.920
we had not heard from him, his phone was switched off.

0:03:02.920,0:03:06.160
The whole of Sunday I said to myself that there was no need to call him

0:03:06.160,0:03:10.140
because we didn't know where 
he was -  whether he's dead or not.

0:03:10.140,0:03:13.440
I didn't want to have pain again.

0:03:13.440,0:03:18.920
But on Monday morning, I just woke up and the Spirit of God said, "Call him!"

0:03:18.920,0:03:26.300
I called Emmanuel. Lo and behold, 
the line that had not been ringing rang.

0:03:26.300,0:03:30.700
And I screamed, "Emmanuel, where are you?"

0:03:30.700,0:03:32.300
He said, "Mummy, I'm around."

0:03:32.300,0:03:36.420
I said, "Can you come right 
away to the Synagogue to see me".

0:03:36.420,0:03:42.320
That is how the prophecy came to pass immediately.

0:03:42.320,0:03:45.900
He came last week and received his own deliverance.

0:03:45.900,0:03:48.580
My name is Emmanuel Ekanem.

0:03:48.580,0:03:52.540
The person standing beside me is my mum.

0:03:52.540,0:04:01.960
I came to The SCOAN because I had the problem of stealing, smoking,

0:04:01.960,0:04:12.180
I was addicted to drugs, I was a fraudster - I did online fraud, credit card fraud.

0:04:12.180,0:04:15.880
Whatever thing that has to do with fraud, you just name it.

0:04:15.880,0:04:21.800
I was also involved with some friends 
of mine who were into armed robbery.

0:04:21.800,0:04:28.700
This problem of mine started a very long time ago,
from when I was very young.

0:04:28.700,0:04:35.760
I was always very brilliant in school. I never even used to read for my exams.

0:04:35.760,0:04:40.280
I was always brilliant but I always 
had this spirit of stealing,

0:04:40.280,0:04:48.020
taking what wasn't mine like phones, money - I would take people's money and phones.

0:04:48.020,0:04:51.080
I was always bringing 
embarrassment to my family

0:04:51.080,0:04:58.980
because even in school, like in secondary school, I would steal someone's money

0:04:58.980,0:05:02.080
and they would have to call my parents to come to school.

0:05:02.080,0:05:05.120
So I was always bringing shame to my family.

0:05:05.120,0:05:11.660
That's how it had been from when I was even very little. Just making bad friends.

0:05:11.660,0:05:16.080
I was making bad friends by default,
I didn't even have to try hard.

0:05:16.080,0:05:22.660
Every friend I was making was bad.

0:05:22.660,0:05:26.680
I am actually from a very good home.

0:05:26.680,0:05:29.540
I didn't have any reason for doing all this.

0:05:29.540,0:05:33.780
I was sent to the best schools that you could think of.

0:05:33.780,0:05:38.660
I was even sent to Canada, I was in Canada as of 2009.

0:05:38.660,0:05:44.660
I gained admission into the University
 of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada.

0:05:44.660,0:05:50.240
So that was where I got involved with credit-card fraud.

0:05:50.240,0:05:53.240
I made a lot of bad friends, I was into drugs,

0:05:53.240,0:05:56.340
I was smoking all the time, I wasn't 
even going to school.

0:05:56.340,0:06:00.320
My mum would always send me
 school fees to pay my school fees,

0:06:00.320,0:06:04.520
but I would always end up spending the money on drugs,

0:06:04.520,0:06:08.120
going to clubs and I wasn't going to school.

0:06:08.120,0:06:12.760
I'm also very good with computers.

0:06:12.760,0:06:17.960
Anything that has to do with computers - I can programme, I can do softwares and hacking,

0:06:17.960,0:06:21.300
whatever you can think of.

0:06:21.300,0:06:23.780
I was into credit card fraud.

0:06:23.780,0:06:29.840
I was cloning different credit 
cards and different people's accounts.

0:06:29.840,0:06:33.420
So I was doing this over time.

0:06:33.420,0:06:39.700
There was this job that I did - this credit card job I did for 200,000 dollars.

0:06:39.700,0:06:44.220
I was the one that did everything.

0:06:44.220,0:06:51.820
I cloned the credit card, went 
into the bank and withdrew this money.

0:06:51.820,0:06:55.460
My picture and everything was in the bank.

0:06:55.460,0:06:59.380
Prior to this time, I never used to go into the bank to do anything

0:06:59.380,0:07:02.380
but that very time I went to the bank.

0:07:02.380,0:07:06.520
I withdrew the money and the 
police started looking for me in Canada.

0:07:06.520,0:07:12.440
Then I was trying to move to
 a different city to just lay low.

0:07:12.440,0:07:16.300
So on trying to go, I actually got caught by the police,

0:07:16.300,0:07:20.040
and I was the first person they caught, and I told them the names

0:07:20.040,0:07:26.600
of five of my accomplices that did the credit card scam.

0:07:26.600,0:07:30.280
I noticed that most of the
people that I got arrested with

0:07:30.280,0:07:37.040
were given long jail terms
like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years.

0:07:37.040,0:07:43.400
All this while, my mom didn't know I was in jail.

0:07:43.400,0:07:49.040
I was the only one that they gave the option 
of being deported back to Nigeria.

0:07:49.040,0:07:52.600
I don't even know why because 
I didn't even have a lawyer at that time

0:07:52.600,0:07:56.840
that would represent me in court or anything.

0:07:56.840,0:08:00.720
At the end of the day, I was deported and that is how my mum found out

0:08:00.720,0:08:05.000
that I was not going to school 
and I was living this life of crime.

0:08:05.000,0:08:09.660
When I got back to Nigeria, my mom actually tried.

0:08:09.660,0:08:14.520
She wanted to set me up with
a business, to do shows.

0:08:14.520,0:08:20.360
She gave me 7 million naira and a brand new hilux.

0:08:20.360,0:08:24.640
It was her vehicle at that time so upon coming back,

0:08:24.640,0:08:29.480
she gave me the car to be using around.

0:08:29.480,0:08:35.040
She lives in Abuja so I was in Abuja with her at that point in time.

0:08:35.040,0:08:36.960
So when she gave me the money 
and the car,

0:08:36.960,0:08:41.540
I left Abuja and ran to Lagos 
with two friends that I had just made.

0:08:41.540,0:08:47.400
They were into drugs - we were always smoking together, going to nightclubs and all that.

0:08:47.400,0:08:54.860
When we came down to Lagos, I started staying in a hotel until when the 7 million were exhausted.

0:08:54.860,0:08:59.960
I didn't have any money. I sold the hilux that my mum had given to me.

0:08:59.960,0:09:03.560
She had bought the hilux for 7.5 million.

0:09:03.560,0:09:10.940
I sold it for like  2.3 million naira -
way less than the value of the car.

0:09:10.940,0:09:16.380
All for just drugs, going to nightclubs, and staying in a hotel.

0:09:16.380,0:09:18.780
The money finished at the end of the day.

0:09:18.780,0:09:25.600
So I ran back to my mom in Abuja 
and that was how it was going on and on.

0:09:25.600,0:09:30.460
Even one day I took her 
cheque book and I wrote everything on it.

0:09:30.460,0:09:33.320
I forged her signature and I went to the bank.

0:09:33.320,0:09:39.060
They actually paid me the amount of 500,000 on the cheque book.

0:09:39.060,0:09:44.820
So that's what I was doing. And any time I did this, I would always run away.

0:09:44.820,0:09:47.480
When the money was exhausted, I would always run back.

0:09:47.480,0:09:52.540
So this was going on and on until my mum started having medical issues -

0:09:52.540,0:09:56.240
she was having high blood pressure.

0:09:56.240,0:09:58.820
She couldn't deal with me anymore.

0:09:58.820,0:10:01.900
So she told me that I should come down to Lagos and stay with my father

0:10:01.900,0:10:04.520
because my dad lives here in Lagos.

0:10:04.520,0:10:08.800
So I came to Lagos to stay with my dad, and it was just the same thing.

0:10:08.800,0:10:13.200
I was giving my dad stress. I would take his money and run away.

0:10:13.200,0:10:18.620
I wouldn't come back, mingle with bad friends, smoke, take drugs and everything.

0:10:18.620,0:10:22.840
I met some friends that were into armed robbery at a point here in Lagos.

0:10:22.840,0:10:28.960
They posed to me as internet fraudsters.

0:10:28.960,0:10:31.460
I thought maybe that was what they were into.

0:10:31.460,0:10:34.740
Later, I discovered that they were into armed robbery.

0:10:34.740,0:10:40.540
They initiated me into the gang 
and I started going on operations with them.

0:10:40.540,0:10:43.740
That's how the thing just continued.

0:10:43.740,0:10:48.680
I was going on operations with my friends who were armed robbers.

0:10:48.680,0:10:52.900
We were actually carrying guns when going on these operations.

0:10:52.900,0:10:59.080
We were making so much money but 
they were not giving me enough.

0:10:59.080,0:11:05.960
One of the members told me that if I continued, 
I would start getting more money

0:11:05.960,0:11:13.520
as compared to when I just started going
out with them on robbery incidents.

0:11:13.520,0:11:16.580
I also was getting people totrust me.

0:11:16.580,0:11:21.680
Once they trusted me, I would take their properties and just run away.

0:11:21.680,0:11:26.800
I also deceived people because I would 
tell people that my mum was very influential

0:11:26.800,0:11:32.480
and if they wanted to get visas to 
travel abroad, they could give me the money,

0:11:32.480,0:11:36.940
then I would talk to my mum 
and we would procure the visas for them.

0:11:36.940,0:11:42.680
I did this to three or four different people.
Some people gave me 1 million, 2 million,

0:11:42.680,0:11:45.660
1.5 million, and I would just run away with the money.

0:11:45.660,0:11:48.060
They would trace me back to my mom.

0:11:48.060,0:11:52.180
My mom would say that she hadn't seen me for months,

0:11:52.180,0:11:55.740
She didn't even know where I was or where I was sleeping.

0:11:55.740,0:12:00.540
That's how it was going on and on while
 I was living with my dad here in Lagos.

0:12:00.540,0:12:07.660
Three weeks ago I took my 
dad's phone and I went to sell it.

0:12:07.660,0:12:10.940
After selling my dad's phone,
he got angry with me.

0:12:10.940,0:12:17.240
He locked the house and told me that I shouldn't come back unless I came back with his phone.

0:12:17.240,0:12:23.540
He didn't know that I was 
with his car keys at that point.

0:12:23.540,0:12:30.640
In the night, I went into the house, started the car, opened the gate quietly and drove the car out.

0:12:30.640,0:12:34.820
I didn't have a phone, I was just with the car.

0:12:34.820,0:12:37.500
I was sleeping inside the car.

0:12:37.500,0:12:41.700
At night, I would just park the 
car somewhere that I felt was safe,

0:12:41.700,0:12:48.300
and I would just sleep there until the next morning - surviving then.

0:12:48.300,0:12:54.800
Two weeks ago on Sunday, 
I had parked by a barber saloon.

0:12:54.800,0:12:57.260
There was a barber saloon by the side.

0:12:57.260,0:13:05.420
Then I saw the prophet's picture on the sliding door of the barber saloon

0:13:05.420,0:13:08.900
but I didn't put any meaning into it. That was where I was throughout that Sunday.

0:13:08.900,0:13:12.020
You mean, you saw a sticker 
with Prophet T.B. Joshua's picture on it.

0:13:12.020,0:13:16.100
I saw a sticker with his picture 
- a very big sticker with his picture there.

0:13:16.100,0:13:20.180
So that was where I was that Sunday. But I didn't really put any meaning into it.

0:13:20.200,0:13:23.400
In fact, that Sunday, I ran out of money, I didn't have money.

0:13:23.400,0:13:25.660
I was with the car. I was trying to sell the car

0:13:25.660,0:13:32.840
but for some reason, I was not getting anybody that was interested in buying it.

0:13:32.840,0:13:39.120
On that Sunday, I wanted to put my sim card in the phone - in any phone I could get

0:13:39.120,0:13:42.460
so that I could call those my 
friends that were into armed robbery

0:13:42.460,0:13:45.360
and see if I could go with them on any operation.

0:13:45.360,0:13:49.220
Just to get little money because I was out of money.

0:13:49.220,0:13:53.840
So that Monday morning, I just spoke to the barber at the saloon.

0:13:53.840,0:13:58.000
I told him that the car had broken down. I needed to call someone to help me fix it.

0:13:58.000,0:14:01.880
So when I put my sim card in the phone,  I didn't even dial any number.

0:14:01.880,0:14:06.100
The call that came in - it was my mum.

0:14:06.100,0:14:10.000
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:14:10.000,0:14:15.300
So at the very moment you placed the SIM card in that phone, your mom just called?

0:14:15.300,0:14:15.980
Yes.

0:14:15.980,0:14:19.340
And when was the last time you
had seen or spoken with her?

0:14:19.340,0:14:23.840
For over eight months I had not seen or spoken to her.

0:14:23.840,0:14:27.080
So when I saw the caller's number, I was very surprised.

0:14:27.080,0:14:30.240
When I picked the call, I thought 
she was going to shout at me,

0:14:30.240,0:14:33.260
ask me where I was with the car and everything.

0:14:33.260,0:14:35.680
So when I picked the call, she asked me where I was.

0:14:35.680,0:14:39.120
I told her I was around in Lagos here.

0:14:39.120,0:14:41.440
I didn't even know she was also in Lagos.

0:14:41.440,0:14:44.320
She told me that I should start coming down here.

0:14:44.320,0:14:47.280
I told her I didn't have any money.
She told me I should find a way.

0:14:47.280,0:14:52.600
I should enter a taxi, whatever I could find and just come down here to The SCOAN.

0:14:52.600,0:14:54.820
So I came down here on that Monday.

0:14:54.820,0:15:00.220
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:00.220,0:15:05.640
Brother, we saw that on last week's Sunday, your mum cried out to Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:15:05.640,0:15:07.800
as he was moving around, praying for people

0:15:07.800,0:15:10.660
and we saw how he prayed for you in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:15:10.660,0:15:17.300
Can you just describe what happened to you at that point.

0:15:17.300,0:15:25.180
At the point when the prophet touched me, I felt like - for 2 or 3 minutes I blacked out.

0:15:25.180,0:15:28.300
I didn't even know where I was at that point in time.

0:15:28.300,0:15:34.660
I didn't even know where I was, I was confused.

0:15:34.660,0:15:39.480
I was weak; everything was just
going on with me at the same time.

0:15:39.480,0:15:43.800
I was shivering in my bones,
I was cold, I was hot.

0:15:43.800,0:15:46.640
I was just feeling everything at that point in time.

0:15:46.640,0:15:49.020
And had you ever experienced anything like that before?

0:15:49.020,0:15:50.440
Never, never!

0:15:50.440,0:15:54.860
Many men of God had placed their hands on me.

0:15:54.860,0:15:59.460
When I went to church before, it didn't move me.

0:15:59.460,0:16:04.500
I always prayed for them to touch me 
to see if I would fall or something like that.

0:16:04.500,0:16:13.620
But I never felt that strong force in me before.

0:16:13.620,0:16:17.040
I knew I was shivering in my body, I started feeling cold.

0:16:17.040,0:16:19.500
I started feeling things leaving me.

0:16:19.500,0:16:24.640
I was just feeling so strange that very day.

0:16:24.640,0:16:32.840
I felt like something was coming out of me, leaving me - my whole body, my legs and my hands.

0:16:32.840,0:16:38.900
I just thank God for my life because I'm
 not even supposed to be living right now.

0:16:38.900,0:16:40.660
I'm just happy from the bottom of my heart.

0:16:40.660,0:16:46.280
Glory be to God and since that touch, just tell us - what are the changes you've seen in your life?

0:16:46.280,0:16:57.120
Before, it was always very hard for me to stay two or three hours without smoking or taking drugs.

0:16:57.120,0:17:03.380
But since that day up till now, it's been
a week and I haven't even gone near

0:17:03.380,0:17:07.540
cigarettes, drugs or anything pertaining to that.

0:17:07.540,0:17:11.240
So I just give God the glory.

0:17:11.240,0:17:16.160
Now, those people like me - I used to believe that there is a God -

0:17:16.160,0:17:20.520
a life without Jesus is more or less a wasted life.

0:17:20.520,0:17:26.500
We should always look for a way to do good and not do evil.

0:17:26.500,0:17:30.640
Always try and pick your friends and don't let your friends pick you

0:17:30.640,0:17:37.480
because if I had known Jesus earlier, I know that by now, I would have been somewhere -

0:17:37.480,0:17:41.300
greater than where I am today.

0:17:41.300,0:17:45.420
It has just been the devil all the way, right 
from when I was very young.

0:17:45.420,0:17:49.480
I'm just happy that 
Jesus has saved me through the prophet.

0:17:49.480,0:17:51.120
I'm glad.

0:17:51.120,0:17:56.680
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:17:56.680,0:17:58.740
Praise the Lord!

0:17:58.740,0:18:09.660
Actually, when I came here the day I left Abuja, I told God that I'm going to a final destination.

0:18:09.660,0:18:18.980
I told myself that there is no way I will leave The SCOAN without a testimony.

0:18:18.980,0:18:27.820
When the man of God walked up to me, I did not expect him to tell me to forgive this man.

0:18:27.820,0:18:31.780
I was hoping that he was going to ask me, "Where is your son",

0:18:31.780,0:18:34.660
like I have heard him ask other people.

0:18:34.660,0:18:36.640
But I was shocked!

0:18:36.640,0:18:41.580
That is to show that he saw my heart; I was in pain.

0:18:41.580,0:18:46.720
I can't deny that. I was so much in pain because the person

0:18:46.720,0:18:52.180
that was supposed to play the role of a father did not do that.

0:18:52.180,0:18:55.400
So I have been living in pain.

0:18:55.400,0:18:58.480
I have forgiven him, Man of God.

0:18:58.480,0:19:00.980
I have forgiven him.

0:19:00.980,0:19:09.220
My son - I speak as a mother - is not supposed to be alive today

0:19:09.220,0:19:18.400
because as a family, we had prayed for him to die.

0:19:18.400,0:19:25.460
The reason I'm saying this is that he caused us so much pain -

0:19:25.460,0:19:28.840
when I mean pain, I mean pain.

0:19:28.840,0:19:33.520
So much embarrassment and shame.

0:19:33.520,0:19:43.860
I cried, went to churches, fasted and prayed but nothing seemed to happen.

0:19:43.860,0:19:48.020
That was why I ran to The SCOAN.

0:19:48.020,0:19:51.280
I never used to watch Emmanuel TV.

0:19:51.280,0:19:56.900
A friend introduced me to this channel, and I started watching it.

0:19:56.900,0:20:00.440
I just left it on permanently in my bedroom.

0:20:00.440,0:20:05.020
People came to my house and asked, "Oh! You are now for Emmanuel TV, T.B. Joshua?"

0:20:05.020,0:20:08.280
I said, "Yes". - "Without even coming here?"

0:20:08.280,0:20:15.580
I said, "Yes. What I am seeing happening there, I believe it will happen to me too".

0:20:15.580,0:20:22.620
I even told a friend, "One day you will see me testify".

0:20:22.620,0:20:26.260
And today our mother 
is indeed testifying to the glory of God.

0:20:26.260,0:20:34.400
Before he left for Canada, he first got admission as a child into King's College.

0:20:34.400,0:20:39.300
At King's College, he wasn't there up to a month.

0:20:39.300,0:20:46.420
One morning between 6 and 7am, we just saw him coming in.

0:20:46.420,0:20:52.840
He didn't have any shirt and shoes on him.

0:20:52.840,0:20:56.440
I believe most people know where King's College is located.

0:20:56.440,0:20:59.560
And we asked him, "Where are you coming from?"

0:20:59.560,0:21:01.540
He said, "From school".

0:21:01.540,0:21:05.300
"Without shirt, without shoes?"

0:21:05.300,0:21:10.120
I was scared; this boy was just 9 years old.

0:21:10.120,0:21:11.760
We took him back.

0:21:11.760,0:21:15.240
He was never in school -
one complaint after the other.

0:21:15.240,0:21:19.120
The father said we should
 take him out of King's College.

0:21:19.120,0:21:24.360
I said, "How can I? This is a school where every parent
 would want her their to be.

0:21:24.360,0:21:26.960
Why would I withdraw him from King's College?"

0:21:26.960,0:21:30.080
We now decided that that was the best thing to do.

0:21:30.080,0:21:32.740
We had to withdraw him from King's College.

0:21:32.740,0:21:39.020
Before taking him out of King's College, we had to look for a school that had the highest fence.

0:21:39.020,0:21:43.080
I personally came down to scout all private schools

0:21:43.080,0:21:48.420
to see which one had the highest fence that he would not scale.

0:21:48.420,0:21:53.020
We got one in Ikeja. He started school.

0:21:53.020,0:21:58.660
The same thing continued and I wondered, "What kind of a thing is this?"

0:21:58.660,0:22:05.100
They gave him corporal punishment for scaling the fence -  a very high fence.

0:22:05.100,0:22:16.240
It continued but during WAEC, the school was shocked and surprised that he had the best results.

0:22:16.240,0:22:21.480
This was a boy that did not read, that was never in school.

0:22:21.480,0:22:27.060
The proprietress called us and said, 
"Madam, let this boy go to a private university

0:22:27.060,0:22:29.860
so that his time will not be wasted".

0:22:29.860,0:22:35.200
Of all my children, he is the only 
one that went to a private university.

0:22:35.200,0:22:38.160
He got admission into Babcock University.

0:22:38.160,0:22:43.880
He did not read for the exams, he just walked
 into the exam hall and passed.

0:22:43.880,0:22:46.820
He started University.

0:22:46.820,0:22:49.240
He was not in school for one month.

0:22:49.240,0:22:55.860
The father would go to the school, go to a hospital and get a medical report that he's asthmatic.

0:22:55.860,0:23:02.800
That's why he ran away, he was in the hospital. 
The father did that three times.

0:23:02.800,0:23:07.240
He did that, and the fourth time, 
he said, "No, he's not doing it again!"

0:23:07.240,0:23:09.920
Just to cover up for your son?

0:23:09.920,0:23:14.920
Yes, it was a cover-up so that the school would take him back.

0:23:14.920,0:23:19.780
But the fourth time that he left the school, the father said that he was not going to do it again.

0:23:19.780,0:23:23.340
That's how he came back home. What to do with him, we didn't know.

0:23:23.340,0:23:26.800
We just did not know what do with him.
 He was just there.

0:23:26.800,0:23:29.280
We just did not know what to do.

0:23:29.280,0:23:33.120
Each time he disappeared, he would do something.

0:23:33.120,0:23:37.680
At times, when I was in the car, I would be looking at those dust bins, in case I would see a corpse.

0:23:37.680,0:23:43.860
I would be looking at the roadside, hoping that I would see his dead body but it never happened.

0:23:43.860,0:23:49.140
One day in my office, I was making a photocopy of his WAEC results.

0:23:49.140,0:23:54.260
I was crying because the results were fantastic.

0:23:54.260,0:24:00.120
A friend just walked into my office. 
She just met me, I couldn't hide.

0:24:00.120,0:24:04.620
She said, "Why are you crying?"
I just threw the result papers to her.

0:24:04.620,0:24:08.020
And she said, "What! This boy got this result?"

0:24:08.020,0:24:10.920
I said, "But he has refused to be in school".

0:24:10.920,0:24:15.300
She said, "Okay, we are going to  send him out of the country. Maybe that will help him".

0:24:15.300,0:24:19.480
That is how his going to Canada came up.

0:24:19.480,0:24:25.100
Before you know it, he got admission. 
Everything for him is always fast, fast.

0:24:25.100,0:24:29.220
He got admission. He left for Canada.

0:24:29.220,0:24:32.780
I would always visit him, go to the school.

0:24:32.780,0:24:37.160
I would take pictures. He would take me 
to the school. We would take pictures.

0:24:37.160,0:24:40.500
He would say, "Mommy,  
this is this, this is that". I would be happy.

0:24:40.510,0:24:43.550
I would return home,
not knowing that he was not in school.

0:24:43.550,0:24:46.920
That he was just deceiving me.

0:24:46.920,0:24:52.420
The next year I would go again 
because I wanted to keep track.

0:24:52.420,0:24:57.500
I would go, he would just deceive me, 
and I would return home.

0:24:57.500,0:25:02.140
So when it happened like that,
I came back one of the times.

0:25:02.140,0:25:05.460
We hadn't heard from him for a very long time.

0:25:05.460,0:25:07.640
And I was worried.

0:25:07.640,0:25:12.740
One day, a strange person just called and said that he was a lawyer

0:25:12.740,0:25:17.380
representing my son, that my son was in jail.

0:25:17.380,0:25:19.820
My God, and this was during Christmas.

0:25:19.820,0:25:25.040
We were all in Calabar - all of us on Christmas day.

0:25:25.040,0:25:31.220
I couldn't hold myself.
On a Christmas day, my son was in jail!

0:25:31.220,0:25:35.880
That's how the process of getting
 him out came in.

0:25:35.880,0:25:39.940
The lawyer, I was not there.

0:25:39.940,0:25:43.140
To make a long story short, he was deported.

0:25:43.140,0:25:48.780
And it continued until what we are seeing today.

0:25:48.780,0:25:56.160
I give God the glory - the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:25:56.160,0:26:00.080
That is the God that I will worship.

0:26:00.080,0:26:05.480
I will worship that God until the 
day I am called to rest.

0:26:05.480,0:26:08.780
Because that God has...

0:26:08.780,0:26:17.680
Mrs Eno Ekanem & Son
Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony

0:26:17.680,0:26:20.100
I didn't even know he was into armed robbery.

0:26:20.100,0:26:23.200
I'm hearing it for the first time.

0:26:23.200,0:26:28.280
I didn't know. I thought it was all these other ones.

0:26:28.280,0:26:32.060
I never knew he had joined armed robbers.

0:26:32.060,0:26:35.000
Even when I was shouting, "Man of God, help me! He is an armed robber",

0:26:35.000,0:26:39.380
I just wanted to say anything that entered my mouth.

0:26:39.380,0:26:42.980
I just wanted to attract the attention of the man of God.

0:26:42.980,0:26:45.740
I didn't know he was actually an armed robber.

0:26:45.740,0:26:49.680
When I went back to Abuja, I told his older sister,

0:26:49.680,0:26:52.960
when she said, "Mummy, we saw you shouting, 'Armed robber!'

0:26:52.960,0:26:54.820
Is Emma an armed robber?"

0:26:54.820,0:27:01.000
I said, "I just wanted to 
get the man of God's attention".

0:27:01.000,0:27:04.180
Nobody in the family knew that he was an armed robber.

0:27:04.180,0:27:08.400
I just said it that day - until now.

0:27:08.400,0:27:13.380
But I give God the glory because
this God is a covenant keeping God.

0:27:13.380,0:27:23.880
Something had always told me that I was going to testify about this Emmanuel in a large congregation.

0:27:23.880,0:27:29.800
It is not today - over 10 years ago in my church,

0:27:29.800,0:27:36.460
something kept telling me that I was going to testify in a large congregation

0:27:36.460,0:27:39.440
but it never meant anything to me.

0:27:39.440,0:27:43.660
I thought because he's a 
musician, he sings very well -

0:27:43.660,0:27:52.100
he has done a video with Pastor Ranky 
as you see him standing here.

0:27:52.100,0:27:57.920
I thought maybe one day that large congregation or television would be

0:27:57.920,0:28:00.440
as I'm dancing in this video.

0:28:00.440,0:28:02.700
That was what was in my mind.

0:28:02.700,0:28:08.980
But I never knew that it was going to be in a congregation as large as this - worldwide.

0:28:08.980,0:28:15.880
So I give God all the glory.
 I thank the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua.

0:28:15.880,0:28:26.200
God will continue to pour more anointing on you and you will take this generation to the next level.

0:28:26.200,0:28:35.740
I want to advise all other mothers -
it is not about you spoiling your child.

0:28:35.740,0:28:40.380
He was never a pampered child.
I don't know how to pamper children.

0:28:40.380,0:28:42.100
I never pampered him,

0:28:42.100,0:28:45.040
I treated him like every other child.

0:28:45.040,0:28:54.640
But we should know that the devil usually picks on a star in the family.

0:28:54.640,0:29:01.160
That is exactly what happened. 
The devil decided to take my own star.

0:29:01.160,0:29:05.800
But today I have retrieved my star.

0:29:05.800,0:29:11.820
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:29:11.820,0:29:17.160
I want to say here that
I am a member of the Apostolic Church.

0:29:17.160,0:29:24.440
I am a Deaconess. I've been a 
Deaconess for close to 20 years.

0:29:24.440,0:29:29.600
You don't know where your salvation is.

0:29:29.600,0:29:37.360
This is a ministry, this Synagogue is a church I had always had a negative opinion about.

0:29:37.360,0:29:42.820
As I speak, I am sure most of my pastors will see me

0:29:42.820,0:29:50.360
because even the first day I came, and I got my prophecy, people called me from all over,

0:29:50.360,0:30:06.420
"Are you for T.B. Joshua now?" I said, "Yes! That this is where I can see my salvation".

0:30:06.420,0:30:13.040
And I thank God so much for using 
the man of God to liberate my family

0:30:13.040,0:30:21.820
because I believe everything has turned around for our good.

0:30:21.820,0:30:24.500
I had always had a negative impression about the church -

0:30:24.500,0:30:27.260
even more than her; her own was even small.

0:30:27.260,0:30:32.020
Because even when she started watching Emmanuel TV in her room,

0:30:32.020,0:30:38.420
any time I was in Abuja in the house, she would always wake everybody up early in the morning,

0:30:38.420,0:30:41.720
at 5:00 am in the morning when I was still sleeping

0:30:41.720,0:30:45.940
because I would usually go to bed at 3 or 4 am.

0:30:45.940,0:30:49.480
At 5 am she would wake everybody up, that we should come for prayers.

0:30:49.480,0:30:54.280
She would spray the Morning Water on us every morning.

0:30:54.280,0:30:57.380
I was always angry, always pissed off.

0:30:57.380,0:31:00.600
I would be like, "Why are you just 
always disturbing me every morning

0:31:00.600,0:31:06.080
because of this Emmanuel TV,
this Morning Water, this T.B. Joshua?"

0:31:06.080,0:31:11.240
Even when I was with her in Abuja, she told me a certain time that I would come here.

0:31:11.240,0:31:17.420
That day, we had serious arguments because I was telling her that I didn't believe there was God here,

0:31:17.420,0:31:24.100
that I didn't believe that this was where I would get my salvation or deliverance.

0:31:24.100,0:31:28.780
I've always felt that this was not a place of God.

0:31:28.780,0:31:31.880
But on coming here, It's a different story

0:31:31.880,0:31:38.780
I just thank God because most
people like me wouldn't believe.

0:31:38.780,0:31:45.300
But if they can just come - take that step of faith and come - they would surely be delivered.

0:31:45.300,0:31:50.880
I also want to use this medium
to say that I'm very sorry to my mum

0:31:50.880,0:31:55.560
for whatever pain and hurt 
that I've caused her in the past,

0:31:55.560,0:32:02.120
and I want to promise her that she will be happy to have me as a son.

0:32:02.120,0:32:04.640
She will be proud of me one day.

0:32:04.640,0:32:07.480
Mum, I'm sorry!

0:32:07.480,0:32:12.040
