0:26:39.020,0:26:43.700
Right now be open to the Spirit of God.

0:26:43.780,0:26:50.900
Yes, He wants to contact you. He's concerned about you.

0:26:50.900,0:26:55.120
Tell your neighbour: "Jesus is concerned about me".

0:26:55.120,0:26:59.860
Jesus is concerned about me!

0:26:59.860,0:27:01.860
I can't hear you.

0:27:01.880,0:27:06.000
He wants you to be like any apostle

0:27:06.000,0:27:08.000
He has created.

0:27:08.000,0:27:14.600
He is concerned about you. He loves you, He loves you so much - more than you love yourself.

0:27:14.600,0:27:18.500
Jesus loves you more than you love yourself.

0:27:18.580,0:27:23.700
He is concerned about you. Are you ready?

0:27:23.740,0:27:34.600
Right now begin to take your career, business from where it is now to where Jesus wants it to be.

0:27:34.600,0:27:41.800
Open your lips right now. By faith, take your career, your business, finances

0:27:41.800,0:27:48.040
from where they are right now to Jesus wants it to be.

0:28:01.900,0:28:06.000
In Jesus Christ name we pray.

0:28:06.040,0:28:09.520
I command breakthrough to your life!

0:28:09.520,0:28:12.000
Your business - breakthrough!

0:28:12.060,0:28:15.200
Your career - breakthrough!

0:28:15.260,0:28:21.620
I say breakthrough!

0:28:21.620,0:28:23.000
Your efforts - breakthrough!

0:28:23.080,0:28:26.000
Your attempt - breakthrough!

0:28:26.000,0:28:29.020
Your desire - breakthrough!

0:28:29.020,0:28:36.500
Breakthrough!

0:28:36.520,0:28:40.400
I want to hear you shout: "Breakthrough!"

0:28:40.460,0:28:50.100
Breakthrough!

0:28:50.160,0:29:03.100
In Jesus' name!!!

0:29:03.140,0:29:08.700
Jesus is not a man that lies.

0:29:08.780,0:29:11.820
If He says 'yes' - no one can say 'no'.

0:29:12.320,0:29:14.400
If He says 'no' - no one can say 'yes'.

0:29:14.460,0:29:26.500
Jesus says 'breakthrough'.

0:29:26.560,0:29:29.200
I just want to see your belief.

0:29:29.260,0:29:33.500
Breakthrough!

0:29:33.580,0:29:38.860
Your belief is your response.

0:29:39.860,0:29:43.200
I say - breakthrough!

0:29:43.240,0:29:58.900
Breakthrough!

0:29:58.940,0:30:01.200
Hallelujah!

0:30:01.280,0:30:08.600
Believing is our connection. Just believe - you shall be saved, -

0:30:08.600,0:30:11.300
says the Lord.

0:30:11.300,0:30:14.300
That belief is your response.

0:30:14.340,0:30:22.900
At this moment, out there, you can respond to many things and you don't mean it.

0:30:22.900,0:30:26.920
You may shout 'hallelujah' but you don't really mean it.

0:30:26.920,0:30:34.540
But at this moment in His presence He is concerned about your response.

0:30:35.520,0:30:41.080
Whatever you say, so shall it be!

0:30:41.080,0:31:03.800
Breakthrough!

0:31:03.800,0:31:08.700
Hallelujah, I can hear from the Spirit of God.

0:31:08.720,0:31:13.800
He said to me I should say to you: "Just believe".

0:31:13.860,0:31:18.620
He is not saying: "Believe!" He says: "Just believe!"

0:31:18.620,0:31:23.020
There is a difference between 'believe' and 'just believe'.

0:31:23.020,0:31:25.100
He is begging you now.

0:31:25.140,0:31:27.300
Just believe - so shall it be, in Jesus' name.

0:31:27.320,0:31:33.520
Just believe - so shall it be, in Jesus' name.

0:31:33.520,0:31:44.000
Hallelujah.

0:31:44.060,0:31:47.500
Hallelujah!

0:31:47.500,0:31:53.400
Think about that: if Jesus is saying 'just believe', - He is concerned about you.

0:31:53.440,0:32:00.120
He knows you, He knows your disposition.

0:32:00.160,0:32:04.600
He knows you are weak. He wants to be your strength.

0:32:04.600,0:32:07.000
Tell your neighbour: "Just believe".

0:32:07.000,0:32:11.760
Just believe! I can't hear you! Just believe!

0:32:11.760,0:32:26.700
Just believe!

0:32:26.740,0:32:32.700
In this case now no one would leave here without being delivered.

0:32:32.720,0:32:39.800
Jesus says: "Just believe!" He is not saying 'believe', He says "Just believe!'

0:32:39.800,0:32:46.600
He is begging you. Just believe!

0:32:46.600,0:32:50.000
Hallelujah. What is your response now?

0:32:50.060,0:33:04.100
Just believe!

0:33:04.180,0:33:10.700
Viewers all over the world. Just believe!

0:33:10.760,0:33:22.100
Jesus says to you: "Just believe!"

0:33:22.120,0:33:23.380
Hallelujah!
