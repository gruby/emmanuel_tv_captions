0:00:04.060,0:00:10.640
Order every familiar spirit in our midst, out!

0:00:10.640,0:00:17.020
Wherever hidden place they are, begin to order them, Lord!

0:00:17.020,0:00:21.820
Order them, Lord!

0:00:21.820,0:00:24.880
You, familiar spirit!

0:00:24.880,0:00:31.380
You, familiar spirit, in the name of Jesus, I command you out!

0:00:31.380,0:00:40.580
I command you out!

0:00:56.300,0:01:01.660
I am the spiritual husband.

0:01:01.660,0:01:06.260
I make her life miserable.

0:01:06.260,0:01:07.600
How many of you are in her?

0:01:07.600,0:01:08.600
We are three.

0:01:08.600,0:01:10.820
Who is number one and two?

0:01:10.820,0:01:13.080
Number one is...

0:01:13.080,0:01:14.380
Number two?

0:01:14.380,0:01:18.360
Number two is snake

0:01:18.360,0:01:20.640
How do you move?

Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:43.340,0:01:47.680
I don’t want her to have any good in her life.

0:01:47.680,0:01:53.040
Just to destroy her life, to make her miserable.

0:01:53.040,0:01:57.340

0:01:57.340,0:02:02.760
Her family – everyone is miserable.

0:02:02.760,0:02:08.140
Her grandmother sold her to me when she was five years old.

TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:21.440,0:02:23.100
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:23.100,0:02:25.680
My name is Biliki.
I am 25 years old.

0:02:25.680,0:02:30.700
I am from Nigeria but I reside in Cameroon.

0:02:30.700,0:02:32.180
Who is the lady standing beside you?

0:02:32.180,0:02:35.420
This is my mum.
She is from Nigeria too.

0:02:35.420,0:02:41.620
Tell us your story; how this evil spirit began to operate in your life right from the young age.

0:02:41.620,0:02:47.720
It started when I was little, 10 years old.

0:02:47.720,0:02:55.700
One day I was eating and I sent my junior brother to bring me some water.

0:02:55.700,0:03:02.220
Then I threw a spoon and my mum said that I wanted to kill my younger brother.

0:03:02.220,0:03:03.200
I said, "No".

0:03:03.200,0:03:09.600
She went somewhere and when she came back, she said they told her not to beat me

0:03:09.600,0:03:11.600
as I has something on me.

0:03:11.600,0:03:14.020
She asked me if it was true and I told her no.

0:03:14.020,0:03:17.600
I asked her, "Am I a king? Why are you pleading with me?"

0:03:17.600,0:03:25.900
She said it was because I had something on me, that I had a spirit of ogbanje (marine spirit) in me.

0:03:25.900,0:03:30.800
You mean that at the little age your mum actually told you that she could not beat you

0:03:30.800,0:03:34.600
because there was an evil spirit of ogbanje in you?

0:03:34.600,0:03:38.040
She said that the evil spirit was disturbing her and had blocked her way

0:03:38.040,0:03:41.000
for her not to have anything good in her life.

0:03:41.000,0:03:46.560
After she told me that, I became angry and ran away from home in 2003.

0:03:46.560,0:03:49.420
I went to a beach; there was a lady...

0:03:49.420,0:03:51.480
How old were you when you ran away from home?

0:03:51.480,0:03:53.360
I was 15 years old.

0:03:53.360,0:03:59.040
I saw a lady at a beach who told me that she wanted to take me somewhere.

0:03:59.040,0:04:02.400
We were about 10 in number.

0:04:02.400,0:04:03.940
She would always sell girls.

0:04:03.940,0:04:07.560
When she saw me, she said that I was still little, that she would not be able to sell me,

0:04:07.560,0:04:09.720
that she would keep me for herself.

0:04:09.720,0:04:13.920
She told me that she wanted to take me out of the country.

0:04:13.920,0:04:18.280
She took me to Cotonou.

0:04:18.280,0:04:23.700
When we arrived there, she told me that we were going to do the work of prostitution.

0:04:23.700,0:04:25.460
When we started, we were about 10.

0:04:25.460,0:04:28.020
She sold the rest of the girls but didn’t sell me.

0:04:28.020,0:04:29.980
She said it was still because I was a little girl.

0:04:29.980,0:04:31.320
How old were you when you went for prostitution?

0:04:31.320,0:04:34.380
I was 15 years old.

0:04:34.380,0:04:38.960
You said that the girls that were carried there - the lady in question sold them...

0:04:38.960,0:04:39.820
Yes.

0:04:39.820,0:04:43.560
But she didn't sell me because I was little.

0:04:43.560,0:04:49.940
Later, when I started, I saw a man who asked, "You little girl, come over; what are you doing here?"

0:04:49.940,0:04:53.340
I told him I was from Nigeria, that a lady had brought me there.

0:04:53.340,0:04:55.000
He asked why she had brought me there.

0:04:55.000,0:05:00.500
I told him it was for prostitution, that she said I was going to pay her some money - 200,000 naira.

0:05:00.500,0:05:03.060
The man told me to call the lady.

0:05:03.060,0:05:07.120
I called the lady for him and the man asked her, "Why do you bring this little girl to this country

0:05:07.120,0:05:08.780
to become a prostitute?"

0:05:08.780,0:05:13.180
He then gave her money and took me to a place to stay alone.

0:05:13.180,0:05:15.760
After two weeks, the man left.

0:05:15.760,0:05:22.040
When the man left, I started work, serving in a nightclub.

0:05:22.040,0:05:25.620
Men would come to me after serving them and would give me their numbers.

0:05:25.620,0:05:31.980
I would meet them and they would sleep with me.

0:05:31.980,0:05:37.880
For six years, I didn’t have any communication with my mum; no one knew where I was.

0:05:37.880,0:05:41.600
During the period you ran away from your family, nobody knew where you were?

0:05:41.600,0:05:46.340
No, nobody knew where I was for over six years.

0:05:46.340,0:05:51.620
One day, I went somewhere and the spiritualist gave me something to bathe with

0:05:51.620,0:05:52.840
so that I would be able to go home.

0:05:52.840,0:05:58.740
When I went home, I was so angry with my mum.

0:05:58.740,0:06:01.760
When I was little, I would always go to my grandmother's place.

0:06:01.760,0:06:06.860
She would give me a tablet, something like a charm

0:06:06.860,0:06:10.700
and she would ask me what I took when I went to my grandmother's place.

0:06:10.700,0:06:14.540
I would reply, "I told you I didn’t want to go there; she gave me some drugs".

0:06:14.540,0:06:18.940
As a result of those charms, I knew I was possessed with something that disturbed me

0:06:18.940,0:06:21.520
like the spirit of witchcraft because I couldn’t control myself.

0:06:21.520,0:06:28.000
The evil spirit would always push me to go out and didn't want me to stay with my family.

0:06:28.000,0:06:32.700
When you returned to Nigeria, you knew that this spirit was within you,

0:06:32.700,0:06:34.600
because you always had an urge to go out.

0:06:34.600,0:06:37.300
You didn't want to be with your family or stay with your parents whatsoever.

0:06:37.300,0:06:38.480
Yes.

0:06:38.480,0:06:41.300
I didn’t want to see any of them.

0:06:41.300,0:06:45.720
That was 2012 when I went to Niger.

0:06:45.720,0:06:52.160
I went to an herbalist as I wanted the evil spirit to be sent out of me.

0:06:52.160,0:06:53.420
I gave him money.

0:06:53.420,0:06:56.160
He bathed me and performed a ritual.

0:06:56.160,0:06:59.600
In 2012, I came back and shouted at my mum and asked her,

0:06:59.600,0:07:02.320
"When you gave birth to me, who bathed me?"

0:07:02.320,0:07:03.460
She started crying.

0:07:03.460,0:07:09.600
I ran away from home again and went to Cameroon.

0:07:09.600,0:07:14.520
Sorry. Before going ahead - you said that when you went to Niger, you went to a particular spiritualist.

0:07:14.520,0:07:15.920
Yes.

0:07:15.920,0:07:17.000
We can see some pictures here.

0:07:17.000,0:07:18.080
Is this what happened to you?

0:07:18.080,0:07:21.240
Just explain what we are seeing here.

0:07:21.240,0:07:25.640
In this picture, I gave the woman money – 200,000 naira.

0:07:25.640,0:07:29.880
She said she was going to remove the evil spirit from me.

0:07:29.880,0:07:34.500
After giving her the money, she went to buy beads and other items.

0:07:34.500,0:07:39.980
She bathed me, took me to the front of a masquerade and performed the ritual.

0:07:39.980,0:07:45.020
After everything, I noticed that nothing had changed in my life.

0:07:45.020,0:07:48.420
I later came back home and started crying with my mum.

0:07:48.420,0:07:55.380
I didn’t stay more than two or three days before getting angry.

0:07:55.380,0:07:58.220
I didn’t want to see them or be with them.

0:07:58.220,0:08:05.120
So, I went to Cameroon and started work as a…

0:08:05.120,0:08:09.920
What we are understanding from our sister is that right from the very young age - 15

0:08:09.920,0:08:11.620
she is a runaway from home.

0:08:11.620,0:08:13.340
She has not been with her parents or her family.

0:08:13.340,0:08:15.100
They have not known her whereabouts.

0:08:15.100,0:08:21.700
Even if she returned back home, it would just be for a few days, before that spirit pushed her to leave again

0:08:21.700,0:08:23.860
without any communication with her family.

0:08:23.860,0:08:25.940
She is explaining what we are seeing at the pictures here.

0:08:25.940,0:08:33.020
In the country of Niger she went to a particular spiritualist to do a ritual, which involved purchasing

0:08:33.020,0:08:40.740
a lot of different items, clothing, beads for removing an evil spirit from her life.

0:08:40.740,0:08:44.020
Despite all of these efforts the problem still continued.

0:08:44.020,0:08:45.460
She returned back to Nigeria.

0:08:45.460,0:08:49.680
Within two days of being with her family, she ran away again.

0:08:49.680,0:08:52.340
Sister, where did you go at this point?

0:08:52.340,0:08:55.780
I went to Cameroon.

0:08:55.780,0:09:06.660
I started working in Cameroon as a strip dancer.

0:09:06.660,0:09:11.060
Men would normally come to me and give me money, telling me I was a good dancer.

0:09:11.060,0:09:17.840
Miss Biliki & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:09:17.840,0:09:24.900
After dancing, men would give me their numbers and I would tell them I would see them after work.

0:09:24.900,0:09:26.980
One day there was a lady...

0:09:26.980,0:09:32.460
You mean in Cameroon you began working at the strip club as a stripper?

0:09:32.460,0:09:33.080
Yes.

0:09:33.080,0:09:35.700
You also continued the lifestyle of prostitution?

0:09:35.700,0:09:36.420
Yes.

0:09:36.420,0:09:43.520
I would dance naked.

0:09:43.520,0:09:46.980
The men would throw money on me.

0:09:46.980,0:09:48.760
I got tired of all that I was doing.

0:09:48.760,0:09:54.380
I went to a place where I saw a woman and I explained my situation to her.

0:09:54.380,0:09:57.360
She said she didn't have anything to give me,

0:09:57.360,0:10:00.420
that what she had to give me was for me to go to T.B. Joshua at The SCOAN.

0:10:00.420,0:10:05.680
She said he would be able to deliver me.

0:10:05.680,0:10:12.520
She spoke to me on Wednesday and I decided to leave Cameroon on Thursday to arrive here on Saturday.

0:10:12.520,0:10:20.360
On my way coming, I would always go to a native doctor and pay them money after which they would

0:10:20.360,0:10:27.300
want to sleep with me and tell me that the spirit that was on me, they would have to remove it by their power

0:10:27.300,0:10:32.080
but that they would have to sleep with me.

0:10:32.080,0:10:38.720
On my way coming here, I decided to test the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua to know if he were really

0:10:38.720,0:10:42.260
a man of God and was able to locate me.

0:10:42.260,0:10:47.300
On Sunday when I came here, I was sitting down there and as he was prophesying to people,

0:10:47.300,0:10:52.180
I was looking at him thinking, "Are you really a man of God? Why can't you see me?"

0:10:52.180,0:10:58.920
As the prayer was going on, I held onto my leg tight because I didn't want to fall

0:10:58.920,0:11:04.140
but I don’t know how come I found myself on the floor.

0:11:04.140,0:11:07.520
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:11:07.520,0:11:10.980
This is what happened last week here at The SCOAN.

0:11:10.980,0:11:12.860
We just want you to explain again, sister.

0:11:12.860,0:11:16.640
You said your reason of coming here was to test the man of God.

0:11:16.640,0:11:17.240
Yes.

0:11:17.240,0:11:18.380
Why was that?

0:11:18.380,0:11:23.960
Because I had been to many places and they would always charge me money

0:11:23.960,0:11:27.800
and later, sleep with me but nothing good would come out of it.

0:11:27.800,0:11:32.460
So, I came here to test him to know if he was really a man of God.

0:11:32.460,0:11:38.780
But I noticed that he did not even look at me, he just turned his back to me.

0:11:38.780,0:11:44.260
Then, during the mass prayer - what happened to you at that moment when the man of God began to pray?

0:11:44.260,0:11:47.320
When they started praying, I stood there and was very angry

0:11:47.320,0:11:50.560
because he didn’t even look at me or come closer to me.

0:11:50.560,0:11:53.620
He was here and I was sitting down there.

0:11:53.620,0:11:58.080
I was very angry and decided that if I left I would not come back here again.

0:11:58.080,0:12:00.080
Miss Biliki & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:12:00.080,0:12:01.780
I didn't know what came over me.

0:12:01.780,0:12:05.000
I saw myself at the back there.

0:12:05.000,0:12:07.720
That was how the evil spirit was exposed.

0:12:07.720,0:12:13.500
After the deliverance, when I slept, I had a dream that I saw a snake.

0:12:13.500,0:12:15.660
I always dreamt about the snake.

0:12:15.660,0:12:18.660
The snake always hit my head.

0:12:18.660,0:12:23.340
In my dream, I saw a woman and a man digging something out of the ground.

0:12:23.340,0:12:24.860
I saw a cobra.

0:12:24.860,0:12:32.000
I turned my back and when I did that, it felt as if someone had thrown the snake on me.

0:12:32.000,0:12:36.240
There was a little boy who told me that the snake was on my back and I woke up.

0:12:36.240,0:12:36.900
Sorry to cut you.

0:12:36.900,0:12:43.000
You mean to say that immediately after your deliverance the same snake that we saw manifest

0:12:43.000,0:12:48.580
during this mass prayer, was revealed to you in your dream as an evidence that you were set free?

0:12:48.580,0:12:49.560
Yes.

0:12:49.560,0:12:53.800
And you said that coming back to Nigeria - you had not seen your mum for how long?

0:12:53.800,0:12:54.700
Four years.

0:12:54.700,0:12:59.180
You mean to say that after the deliverance you have seen your mum for the first time?

0:12:59.180,0:13:02.360
Yes.

0:13:02.360,0:13:06.620
We can imagine what this evil spirit has caused in the life of our sister.

0:13:06.620,0:13:08.300
She is standing here with her mother right now.

0:13:08.300,0:13:11.740
She has not seen or communicated with her mum for so many years.

0:13:11.740,0:13:18.540
From the age of 15 she has been a runaway from the home, only to return to her mum for a few days.

0:13:18.540,0:13:23.040
For the last four years she has not been with her mum because that evil spirit always pushed her

0:13:23.040,0:13:28.440
to leave the house, run away from the family and to have such a hatred towards her parents.

0:13:28.440,0:13:32.360
As you are seeing your mum right now after your deliverance, sister; what do you have to say?

0:13:32.360,0:13:36.620
Actually I went home on Monday.

0:13:36.620,0:13:41.420
I called someone to go with me so that I would be able to take my mum's number but upon getting there,

0:13:41.420,0:13:45.300
I don't know what came over me.

0:13:45.300,0:13:48.980
I shouted our lastborn's name, "Abigail!"

0:13:48.980,0:13:54.060
That was when my mum came out, looked at me and asked, "Why?"

0:13:54.060,0:13:55.800
Then, I started crying.

0:13:55.800,0:14:03.320
That was when she told me that my father was no longer alive, that he had died two years ago.

0:14:03.320,0:14:05.960
You didn't even know that your father had died?

0:14:05.960,0:14:11.200
No.

0:14:11.200,0:14:15.440
Once again viewers all over the world; we thank God for our sister's deliverance.

0:14:15.440,0:14:22.540
As she was explaining before; it was a result of that evil spirit, that entered her right from such a young age,

0:14:22.540,0:14:24.780
to the extent that she hated her family.

0:14:24.780,0:14:26.780
She didn't even know when her own father died.

0:14:26.780,0:14:31.860
We thank God; today she is here with her mum and her eyes had been opened.

0:14:31.860,0:14:36.540
After the deliverance she realized that she has a mum and they are back together.

0:14:36.540,0:14:39.140
Sister, what can you say to the glory of God, after your deliverance?

0:14:39.140,0:14:41.000
How was your life changed?

0:14:41.000,0:14:42.440
My life has changed.

0:14:42.440,0:14:43.900
I didn’t know what came over me.

0:14:43.900,0:14:45.440
I am not the same.

0:14:45.440,0:14:55.320
I even changed my name to Jessica because I didn't want to use my real name while doing something stupid.

0:14:55.320,0:14:58.440
I had to change my name to Jessica.

0:14:58.440,0:15:02.100
Now, my real name is Biliki, no longer Jessica.

0:15:02.100,0:15:06.180
I thank God for my life and that now, I am with my mum.

0:15:06.180,0:15:10.020
Let's put our hands for Jesus Christ.

0:15:10.020,0:15:15.720
You mean to say sister; before coming to The SCOAN, you were coming from that strip club in Cameroon?

0:15:15.720,0:15:17.300
Yes.

0:15:17.300,0:15:22.020
I lied to my boss that I wasn’t feeling fine and wanted to relax for three weeks.

0:15:22.020,0:15:25.940
He said, "OK, there is no problem".
That is why I am here.

0:15:25.940,0:15:29.300
Now, after your deliverance; how do you want to go about your life?

0:15:29.300,0:15:33.520
Do you still have the mind of returning to that kind of life-style of prostitution, strip dancing?

0:15:33.520,0:15:37.940
No! I really want God to help me because I can't do it on my own.

0:15:37.940,0:15:40.580
That is why I am here.
I am tired.

0:15:40.580,0:15:42.340
I want my family to change.

0:15:42.340,0:15:46.460
I want everything to change about my life, my mum and my younger ones.

0:15:46.460,0:15:51.100
I really want people to help me because I have nobody except my mum.

0:15:51.100,0:15:54.300
If they could help me, I would be so glad.

0:15:54.300,0:15:55.520
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:15:55.520,0:15:59.420
Once again - we know that Jesus Christ through this deliverance has opened the door.

0:15:59.420,0:16:05.660
Our sister - you can see the tears in her eyes as a result of now regretting her past life

0:16:05.660,0:16:10.120
and having the opportunity to reconcile with her family after the deliverance.

0:16:10.120,0:16:14.740
We know that the same God who has delivered you, will definitely usher you towards the breakthrough,

0:16:14.740,0:16:16.460
that He has for you.

0:16:16.460,0:16:23.020
Finally sister, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world, based on your experiences in life?

0:16:23.020,0:16:29.160
My advice to viewers all over the world, girls like me – there is nothing there.

0:16:29.160,0:16:31.520
I thank God that I came out alive.

0:16:31.520,0:16:36.800
There are many girls – most of my friends whom we were together, most of them have died.

0:16:36.800,0:16:41.780
Some of them are miserable but I am still alive; I am OK.

0:16:41.780,0:16:47.780
I just want to tell people watching me to focus their minds on God.

0:16:47.780,0:16:52.880
It is only God who can change everything – no one else except God.

0:16:52.880,0:16:58.280
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:16:58.280,0:17:01.060
We just want to hear a quick word from your mum as well.

0:17:01.060,0:17:05.480
What she has to say about your being here today to the glory of God?

0:17:05.480,0:17:06.400
Momma, you are welcome.

0:17:06.400,0:17:08.080
Just introduce yourself to us.

0:17:08.080,0:17:11.020
My name is Amuda.

0:17:11.020,0:17:15.240
I thank God that through the help of Emmanuel TV, I have been able to locate my daughter, Biliki.

0:17:15.240,0:17:19.540
Biliki had disappeared for 11 years and I had no contact with her.

0:17:19.540,0:17:22.080
When I would go to church, they would tell me that she was still alive.

0:17:22.080,0:17:25.300
On Tuesday, I saw Biliki but she did not want to come to me.

0:17:25.300,0:17:30.480
She called on Abigail who beckoned on me but I asked Abigail to confirm it was Biliki.

0:17:30.480,0:17:33.660
As I was about to get up, Abigail shouted at Biliki, "Aunty Biliki!"

0:17:33.660,0:17:38.460
This caught everyone's attention and they gathered asking Biliki why she had treated her mum that way.

0:17:38.460,0:17:42.040
I thank God for delivering her for me.

0:17:42.040,0:17:46.460
Biliki asked for her father and I told her that he had died.

0:17:46.460,0:17:52.440
Our mother is saying that for 11 years she had not known where her daughter was.

0:17:52.440,0:17:54.740
She had no idea of her whereabouts.

0:17:54.740,0:18:00.640
After receiving her deliverance on Sunday, she received news on Tuesday that someone was outside

0:18:00.640,0:18:01.820
asking for her.

0:18:01.820,0:18:09.000
Upon coming out she met with her daughter, who had come back to the house after 11 years of separation.

0:18:09.000,0:18:14.480
The mother is giving glory to God and thanking God that Jesus Christ has delivered her daughter

0:18:14.480,0:18:15.740
after so many years.

0:18:15.740,0:18:16.840
We give glory to God.

0:18:16.840,0:18:20.780
We want to encourage our sister who, is now delivered by Christ's word.

0:18:20.780,0:18:25.380
She must be ruled by His word in order to make this deliverance permanent.

0:18:25.380,0:18:28.660
We believe that best is yet to come, as you do so, in Jesus' name.

0:18:28.660,0:18:30.420
[Amen.]

0:18:30.420,0:18:39.360
After much counselling at SCOAN, Biliki and her mother are given financial support to start a new life

0:18:39.360,0:18:41.380
in Christ Jesus.

0:18:41.380,0:18:42.820
Glory be to God.

0:18:42.820,0:18:45.380
My name is Biliki.
I am 29 years old.

0:18:45.380,0:18:47.920
The woman beside me is my mum.

0:18:47.920,0:18:54.320
I want to thank God for what He has done in my life and for my deliverance.

0:18:54.320,0:18:58.520
I was here two Sundays ago.

0:18:58.520,0:19:02.480
During the mass prayer, God arrested me.

0:19:02.480,0:19:08.560
The evil spirit in me confessed and I received my deliverance.

0:19:08.560,0:19:15.200
Last week Sunday, I was here with my mum to testify of what God had done in my life.

0:19:15.200,0:19:19.960
Previously, I lived a miserable life of prostitution.

0:19:19.960,0:19:26.200
I travelled to two countries – Cotonou (Republic of Benin) and Cameroon.

0:19:26.200,0:19:35.780
I was based in Cameroon, working in a nightclub as striptease dancer.

0:19:35.780,0:19:38.100
I was meeting men.

0:19:38.100,0:19:41.500
After living this life, I didn’t gain anything from it.

0:19:41.500,0:19:45.720
Nothing good came out of the money I made.

0:19:45.720,0:19:48.860
I had not seen my parents for seven years.

0:19:48.860,0:19:53.120
So, when my father died, I did not even know.

0:19:53.120,0:20:02.520
When I came here, I got my deliverance and the man of God asked me to come with my mum.

0:20:02.520,0:20:08.740
When I came with my mum, I shared my testimony.

0:20:08.740,0:20:11.060
I thank God that I am free now.

0:20:11.060,0:20:13.420
Since then, I have been OK.

0:20:13.420,0:20:15.360
I can read my Bible and pray.

0:20:15.360,0:20:22.200
So, I thank God for my life and for what God has done in my life - for my deliverance and breakthrough.

0:20:22.200,0:20:23.340
To God be the glory.

0:20:23.340,0:20:28.800
Indeed - we thank God Almighty for the wonderful deliverance you received.

0:20:28.800,0:20:36.580
Those who were following Emmanuel TV two last weeks will really understand how mighty the deliverance

0:20:36.580,0:20:40.760
that God Almighty has done was.

0:20:40.760,0:20:44.000
We thank God also for bringing you back to your parents, whom you have lost contact with,

0:20:44.000,0:20:46.720
for so many years.

0:20:46.720,0:20:50.020
The life I was living was one of misery.

0:20:50.020,0:20:56.420
I would not wish for anyone to do the kind of things I was doing.

0:20:56.420,0:20:57.980
Most of my friends have died.

0:20:57.980,0:21:02.620
Some of them have sicknesses but I thank God that I came out alive,

0:21:02.620,0:21:05.200
safely and without injury or sickness.

0:21:05.200,0:21:06.480
I want to thank God.

0:21:06.480,0:21:11.660
To my girl friends who are watching me now, I just want to give you this advice:

0:21:11.660,0:21:16.720
It is better that you come out from it so that God can deliver you the way He delivered me.

0:21:16.720,0:21:17.680
I thank God.

0:21:17.680,0:21:20.100
My name is Amuda

0:21:20.100,0:21:23.960
What can you say about the deliverance in life of your daughter?

0:21:23.960,0:21:31.080
You are back here with your daughter to thank God for the wonderful things He has done in your life.

0:21:31.080,0:21:35.820
What can you say about what God has done in the life of your daughter?

0:21:35.820,0:21:41.500
I thank God as I have seen my daughter who has come back home.

0:21:41.500,0:21:42.440
I thank God that she has changed.

0:21:42.440,0:21:46.900
She reads the Bible and wants to start a new life now.

0:21:46.900,0:21:48.620
I thank God for T.B. Joshua.

0:21:48.620,0:21:49.500
Thank you very much.

0:21:49.500,0:21:50.660
You heard it from momma.

0:21:50.660,0:21:54.960
Momma says she is grateful to God Almighty for the deliverance in the life of her daughter.

0:21:54.960,0:21:57.280
Her daughter is a changed person now.

0:21:57.280,0:22:01.880
She can read the Bible, she can pray, she can meditate on the word of God,

0:22:01.880,0:22:06.980
unlike before, when for so many years she didn't know where her daughter was.

0:22:06.980,0:22:11.520
She was separated from the daughter because of the past life she was living.

0:22:11.520,0:22:15.280
Now she is happy to have her daughter back.

0:22:15.280,0:22:20.020
Dear sister, we also have a message from the anointed man of God to you:

0:22:20.020,0:22:27.320

Now that I am going, I am going to start a new life, sin no more and follow God's ways.

0:23:23.500,0:23:30.800
I know very soon that I will come back here with a big testimony, in the mighty name of Jesus.

which you have to read from time to time and emulate the life-style of great people of God of old,

0:23:53.260,0:23:59.000
some of which have also passed through some hard times in life and came out of it

0:23:59.000,0:24:00.620
with the help of God Almighty.

0:24:00.620,0:24:02.900

We believe that as you make use of this cash gift you have received, God Almighty will continue to supply

0:24:12.640,0:24:19.280

Amen. Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
