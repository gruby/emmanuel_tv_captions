Prophet T.B. Joshua is busy praying for those in attendance at the Friday healing and deliverance service,

0:00:07.700,0:00:15.420
at The SCOAN.

0:00:15.420,0:00:17.920
From Niger State.

0:00:17.920,0:00:18.860
This is water?

0:00:18.860,0:00:20.520
This is water, man of God.

0:00:20.520,0:00:26.040
Ask him whether he will give me a drink.

0:00:26.040,0:00:31.720
Here we see Prophet T.B. Joshua taking a flask from the man and drinking the water within,

0:00:31.720,0:00:36.340
showing us that God's kind of love is unconditional.

0:00:36.340,0:00:39.500
God says, "Love your neighbour as yourself".

0:00:39.500,0:00:42.480
Love your neighbour irrespective of colour or creed.

0:00:42.480,0:00:48.060
After drinking some of the water the Prophet playfully loops the flask on his own arm,

0:00:48.060,0:00:53.580
making the man feel happy and "at home" in an unfamiliar environment.

0:00:53.580,0:00:56.060
This is the love of God.

0:00:56.060,0:01:04.080
Giving the elderly man a loving embrace Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for him, in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:01:04.080,0:01:06.260
over the problems in his life.

0:01:06.260,0:01:13.040
He falls to the floor under the anointing of God.

He is free. Give him anything he wants to eat, anything he wants to drink.

0:01:23.900,0:01:27.140
OK, I will give him accommodation to sleep here before he goes back.

0:01:27.140,0:01:28.640
All right sir. Thank you very much, sir.

0:01:28.640,0:01:29.680
Glory be to God.

He feels good and all things passed out.

0:02:56.920,0:03:02.480
Can he demonstrate; touch the stomach to confirm that he is completely healed?

0:03:02.480,0:03:04.180
Can he tap the stomach?

0:03:34.140,0:03:35.800
They are our brothers from Niger State.

0:03:35.800,0:03:41.120
We came together to The SCOAN for prayers and deliverance.

0:03:41.120,0:03:48.440
We can recall seeing Baba Gebrila at the prayer line at the Friday's healing and deliverance service

0:03:48.440,0:03:54.280
at the church, where the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua met our father here.

0:03:54.280,0:04:02.600
We can recall the bottle of water that attracted the Prophet to him, and Prophet drank the water.

0:04:02.600,0:04:11.640
Can you tell us what was it that originally brought our father here to The SCOAN?

0:04:11.640,0:04:17.560
Our father here was having a stomach ulcer for many years.

0:04:17.560,0:04:20.560
He was not able to eat; he was not able to sleep.

0:04:20.560,0:04:23.320
When he was watching Emmanuel TV,

0:04:23.320,0:04:26.100
people told him that if he came here, he would be healed.

0:04:26.100,0:04:28.260
He decided to come.

0:04:28.260,0:04:33.620
They then gathered money and chartered this vehicle down to The SCOAN for prayer.

0:04:33.620,0:04:38.140
We heard about The SCOAN through Emmanuel TV.

Can you tell us what are the challenges that you are still facing now?

0:06:00.080,0:06:08.080
The challenges we are facing now are that we need about 12,000 naira to take us back to Niger State

0:06:08.080,0:06:12.560
because we have spent a lot of money, to the level that the man of God had to intervene

0:06:12.560,0:06:17.140
to give us money to feed ourselves, and for accommodation.

0:06:17.140,0:06:22.700
Now we are broke and we need about 12,000 naira to settle the driver to go back to Niger State.

0:06:22.700,0:06:26.500

Jesus will repay him for all his goodness.

0:08:21.320,0:08:31.320
When we arrived here, I was wondering how they would pay me my money for transporting them back to

0:08:31.320,0:08:34.160
Niger State because I'm the driver.

0:08:34.160,0:08:42.780
When we arrived, we didn't even have any money buy food.

0:08:42.780,0:08:49.300
We were hungry but now we thank God and we thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:49.300,0:08:52.140

The man of God paid for the transportation fee of each and everyone of them.

0:09:16.640,0:09:20.720
He even gave the driver a cash gift and also bags of rice for everyone.

0:09:20.720,0:09:27.900
The driver said he was very grateful and thankful to God Almighty for using the man of God to do such things,

0:09:27.900,0:09:34.860
because he has been thinking of how he was going to get the money and to take them back to the Niger State.

0:09:34.860,0:09:38.780
These were the things he was thinking about.

0:09:38.780,0:09:45.480
