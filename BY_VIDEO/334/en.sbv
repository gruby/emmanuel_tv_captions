0:00:00.000,0:00:03.000
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:00:03.000,0:00:04.480
Speak! Who are you?

0:00:04.480,0:00:06.140
I am from the ocean.

0:00:06.140,0:00:08.200
Who are you in the ocean?

0:00:08.200,0:00:10.980
I am the spirit of lust.

0:00:10.980,0:00:11.560
Yes.

0:00:11.560,0:00:12.920
What have you done to her?

0:00:12.920,0:00:15.020
She always runs to God.

0:00:15.020,0:00:16.340
You do not want her to run to God?

0:00:16.340,0:00:16.960
No.

0:00:16.960,0:00:19.560
Why?

0:00:19.560,0:00:20.760
I hate God.

0:00:20.760,0:00:21.720
You hate God.

0:00:21.720,0:00:22.220
Yes.

0:00:22.220,0:00:24.080
Who are you, if you hate God? Who are you?

0:00:24.080,0:00:26.100
I am the spirit of lust.

0:00:26.100,0:00:26.980
Spirit of lust?

0:00:26.980,0:00:27.640
Yes.

0:00:27.640,0:00:30.160
From which kingdom are you?

0:00:30.160,0:00:32.360
Light or darkness?

0:00:32.360,0:00:34.080
Darkness.

0:00:34.080,0:00:34.720
Yes.

0:00:34.720,0:00:37.040
As a spirit of lust, what have you done to her marriage?

0:00:37.040,0:00:39.300
She will not have an affection for her husband.

0:00:39.300,0:00:40.800
She will not have an affection for her husband?

0:00:40.800,0:00:41.380
No.

0:00:41.380,0:00:43.800
What has that caused between her and her husband?

0:00:43.800,0:00:45.640
They used to fight.

0:00:45.640,0:00:47.640
Who caused this fight?

0:00:47.640,0:00:48.340
Me.

0:00:48.340,0:00:49.220
You caused the fight?

0:00:49.220,0:00:49.900
Yes.

0:00:49.900,0:00:51.260
How long have you been living in this body?

0:00:51.260,0:00:53.980
Since she was small, from eight years.

0:00:53.980,0:00:54.660
Eight years?

0:00:54.660,0:00:55.160
Yes.

0:00:55.160,0:00:57.260
How did you enter her?

0:00:57.260,0:00:58.700
I sent a boy.

0:00:58.700,0:00:59.500
You sent a boy?

0:00:59.500,0:01:00.000
Yes.

0:01:00.000,0:01:01.300
What did the boy do to her?

0:01:01.300,0:01:02.800
He initiated her.

0:01:02.800,0:01:03.640
He initiated her?

0:01:03.640,0:01:04.260
Yes.

0:01:04.260,0:01:05.020
Who is this?

0:01:05.020,0:01:06.360
It’s her daughter.

0:01:06.360,0:01:08.140
Is she not your daughter?

0:01:08.140,0:01:08.800
No.

0:01:08.800,0:01:11.020
Who is she to you?

0:01:11.020,0:01:12.880
I make her frustrated.

0:01:12.880,0:01:14.200
You frustrate her?

0:01:14.200,0:01:16.240
How do you do it?

0:01:16.240,0:01:20.080
Disobedience.

0:01:20.080,0:01:24.560
I make her feel that she is not listening to her mother.

0:01:24.560,0:01:26.980
Why do you do that to her as little as she is?

0:01:26.980,0:01:29.720
I wanted to make her hate her mother.

0:01:29.720,0:01:30.740
To make her hate her mother?

0:01:30.740,0:01:31.240
Yes.

0:01:31.240,0:01:33.000
Were you able to achieve that?

0:01:33.000,0:01:34.560
No.

0:01:34.560,0:01:36.760
Why was it difficult for you to achieve that?

0:01:36.760,0:01:38.720
It is because of this ministry.

0:01:38.720,0:01:39.520
Because of this ministry?

0:01:39.520,0:01:40.120
Yes.

0:01:40.120,0:01:42.200
What is wrong with this ministry that you don't like?

0:01:42.200,0:01:43.960
It sets people free.

0:01:43.960,0:01:45.040
It sets people free?

0:01:45.040,0:01:47.540
Yes, from darkness.

0:01:47.540,0:01:51.060
What is your trouble with that? Is it not a good thing to set people free from darkness?

0:01:51.060,0:01:52.560
No, we hate people.

0:01:52.560,0:01:54.160
You hate people being set free from darkness?

0:01:54.160,0:01:55.840
Yes.

0:01:55.840,0:01:58.320
That means that you belong to the kingdom of darkness?

0:01:58.320,0:02:00.160
Yes.

0:02:00.160,0:02:01.220
How are you?

0:02:01.220,0:02:02.960
I am fine.

0:02:02.960,0:02:04.240
Who is she to you?

0:02:04.240,0:02:05.980
My mummy.

0:02:05.980,0:02:08.300
She said that you are her mom.

0:02:08.300,0:02:09.660
No.

0:02:09.660,0:02:10.800
I am not her mum.

0:02:10.800,0:02:12.660
OK, tell her.

0:02:12.660,0:02:14.880
You are my mummy.

0:02:14.880,0:02:18.460
No, I have nothing to do with her.

0:02:18.460,0:02:19.880
Are you sure she is your mum?

0:02:19.880,0:02:21.280
Yes.

0:02:21.280,0:02:22.660
Right now, it's time to leave this body.

0:02:22.660,0:02:24.780
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus, you demon!

0:02:24.780,0:02:27.960
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:02:27.960,0:02:29.640
Come out of her, you spirit of lust!

0:02:29.640,0:02:32.440
Out, n the mighty name of Jesus!

0:02:32.440,0:02:36.300
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:02:36.300,0:02:39.820
Out!

0:02:39.820,0:02:44.460
Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:02:44.460,0:02:47.300
Out!

0:02:47.300,0:02:49.540
In Jesus' name.

0:02:49.540,0:02:51.020
Thank You, Lord.

0:02:51.020,0:02:53.600
You are delivered.

0:02:53.600,0:02:55.100
Rise up.

0:02:55.100,0:03:03.640
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:03:03.640,0:03:04.680
How are you?

0:03:04.680,0:03:05.500
I am fine.

0:03:05.500,0:03:06.180
Are you sure?

0:03:06.180,0:03:07.800
Yes.

0:03:07.800,0:03:08.960
Who is this?

0:03:08.960,0:03:11.620
This is my daughter.

0:03:11.620,0:03:12.480
Are you sure this is your daughter?

0:03:12.480,0:03:13.060
Yes.

0:03:13.060,0:03:14.200
Earlier you said that you do not know her.

0:03:14.200,0:03:16.400
I gave birth to her.

0:03:16.400,0:03:17.300
You gave birth to her?

0:03:17.300,0:03:17.900
Yes.

0:03:17.900,0:03:19.160
But you denied her just now.

0:03:19.160,0:03:21.020
No. I will never deny her.

0:03:21.020,0:03:23.020
You will never deny her and this is your daughter?

0:03:23.020,0:03:24.080
Yes.

0:03:24.080,0:03:27.860
You said you were the spirit of lust living inside her.

0:03:27.860,0:03:30.480
No, I cannot be a spirit.

0:03:30.480,0:03:33.400
So that very demon that was tormenting you is out. You are free.

0:03:33.400,0:03:35.860
Thank You, Jesus!

0:03:35.860,0:03:38.720
Are you happy now that your mum says that you are her daughter?

0:03:38.720,0:03:39.320
Yes.

0:03:39.320,0:03:40.560
Are you happy?

0:03:40.560,0:03:42.240
Give her a hug.

0:03:42.240,0:03:46.180
Thank you.

0:03:46.180,0:03:48.160
Thank you Jesus!

0:03:48.160,0:03:50.820
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:03:50.820,0:03:52.800
Indeed, God is with us.

0:03:52.800,0:03:58.620
My name is Carolien Coetzee, I am 39 years old, I am from Cape Town, South Africa.

0:03:58.620,0:04:02.260
The man standing next to me is my husband Emil Coetzee.

0:04:02.260,0:04:08.560
The reason we came to The SCOAN in Lagos is to share our wonderful testimony

0:04:08.560,0:04:11.580
of what God has done for us in our lives.

0:04:11.580,0:04:16.880
If it was not for this ministry, the living church we have seen,

0:04:16.880,0:04:20.660
we would not be here today to say "Jesus is Lord".

0:04:20.660,0:04:29.740
I received my deliverance from the spirit of abuse, which was constantly tormenting me for almost 29 years.

0:04:29.740,0:04:34.820
I heard constant voices in my head, which I all this years thought were me.

0:04:34.820,0:04:43.260
I always felt rejected, not good enough, always striving, being busy, never being able to settle down.

0:04:43.260,0:04:51.620
While doing things at home like cooking, I would be worrying about tomorrow or other things.

0:04:51.620,0:04:55.640
I would always be struggling and be frustrated.

0:04:55.640,0:05:02.420
Obviously, the atmosphere in the house was not good.

0:05:02.420,0:05:08.480
Even when I looked at other women, I would always feel not beautiful, not good enough,

0:05:08.480,0:05:12.100
and I would always try to hide myself.

0:05:12.100,0:05:17.560
We then decided to come for the candlelight service in 2012.

0:05:17.560,0:05:22.680
I wanted to bring my daughter, just to experience the blessing here.

0:05:22.680,0:05:29.740
I thank God because as wise man Daniel laid his hands on me, the spirit manifested -

0:05:29.740,0:05:32.700
the spirit of lust who was from the ocean.

0:05:32.700,0:05:36.480
I really didn't have any affection for my husband.

0:05:36.480,0:05:41.440
We would quarrel and fight constantly, never settling issues, just moving along,

0:05:41.440,0:05:44.940
hoping that it would be better tomorrow, or it would be settled by itself.

0:05:44.940,0:05:50.840
I just give glory to God that I brought my daughter, because if I hadn't brought her,

0:05:50.840,0:05:56.200
God could not have revealed the plan of the enemy to destroy our relationship.

0:05:56.200,0:06:02.740
Little did I know that the plan that the enemy had was for her to hate me.

0:06:02.740,0:06:06.800
Yes, I can confirm that it was a constant struggle with her in the house.

0:06:06.800,0:06:12.660
I would hear that voice telling me that she is disobedient. I felt frustrated with her.

0:06:12.660,0:06:16.200
I felt that she was not giving her best.

0:06:16.200,0:06:22.900
I can just confirm that since the deliverance we have such a nice relationship.

0:06:22.900,0:06:29.980
I just say, "Thank You, Jesus, for what You have done, for using this ministry, for using the wise men,

0:06:29.980,0:06:36.780
for using the man of God, to give us an opportunity to come here and receive our deliverance,

0:06:36.780,0:06:42.420
so that we can be free Christians, and really walk as born-again".

0:06:42.420,0:06:44.880
Can you now explain to us -

0:06:44.880,0:06:49.680
how did that affect your relationship with your husband and your daughter?

0:06:49.700,0:06:55.420
Well, the relationship with my husband - I had no affection for my husband.

0:06:55.420,0:07:00.540
If he wanted to meet as husband and wife, I would constantly look for an excuse.

0:07:00.540,0:07:02.520
I didn't have that affection.

0:07:02.520,0:07:06.900
And I knew it was not normal but it was like I could not help myself.

0:07:06.900,0:07:09.260
It is just the spirit controlling you.

0:07:09.260,0:07:12.580
You know it is not normal but you still feel it yourself.

0:07:12.580,0:07:15.620
With my daughter - you could see that she was still little then.

0:07:15.620,0:07:20.520
I would put out a set of clothes and then we would fight even over the clothes she must wear.

0:07:20.520,0:07:27.120
It was this spirit telling me that she is disobedient, she is not listening to you.

0:07:27.120,0:07:31.120
That made me to feel really frustrated with her.

0:07:31.120,0:07:36.180
But now after the deliverance, what are the differences that you have seen?

0:07:36.180,0:07:38.400
Glory be to Jesus!

0:07:38.400,0:07:42.420
It is a totally different relationship I have with my daughter now.

0:07:42.420,0:07:44.000
I picked her up from school.

0:07:44.000,0:07:47.660
Out of her own, she said, "Mummy, you are the best mummy in the world".

0:07:47.660,0:07:51.880
And I know if it was not for that deliverance, it would not have been possible.

0:07:51.880,0:07:55.760
We spend time together. We really have a good relationship.

0:07:55.760,0:08:01.800
And with my husband - I see him now with affection which he is glad of.

0:08:01.800,0:08:09.700
We are really growing stronger and stronger every day, and I just thank the Lord for that.

0:08:09.700,0:08:14.840
She said that they wouldn't be standing here together today if not for that deliverance.

0:08:14.840,0:08:17.020
Now, we would like to listen to the husband

0:08:17.020,0:08:21.480
and find out his own experience and his testimony of the deliverance.

0:08:21.480,0:08:24.340
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:24.340,0:08:29.060
My name is Emil Coetzee. I am from Cape Town, South Africa.

0:08:29.060,0:08:31.660
My house used to be a very sensitive place -

0:08:31.660,0:08:35.140
a place where I used to stand on a tray of eggs,

0:08:35.140,0:08:38.240
a place of quarrel between me and my wife.

0:08:38.240,0:08:44.360
We would have quarrels, and in a time we would settle, but it would be a continuous situation.

0:08:44.360,0:08:50.060
I even noticed that the relationship between my wife and our daughter...

0:08:50.060,0:08:54.640
I actually spoke to her, saying, "You should take care of the way you are treating your daughter

0:08:54.640,0:08:58.460
because she might just start drifting apart". So I really noticed that.

0:08:58.460,0:09:02.960
Can you now share with us - what are the differences that you've seen

0:09:02.960,0:09:06.640
in your marriage and in your family since the deliverance?

0:09:06.640,0:09:07.700
We thank God.

0:09:07.700,0:09:10.920
After a day of work, I actually look forward to get home

0:09:10.920,0:09:13.760
There is peace in my house. The relationships are good.

0:09:13.760,0:09:17.360
The relationship between my daughter and my wife is wonderful.

0:09:17.360,0:09:20.400
The relationship between us: We are free, we can speak,

0:09:20.400,0:09:23.360
we can quarrel and make up, we can discuss things.

0:09:23.360,0:09:27.100
It's just the way a marriage should be.

0:09:27.100,0:09:30.380
And now after receiving this wonderful miracle

0:09:30.380,0:09:33.160
and seeing the change in your marriage and in your family,

0:09:33.160,0:09:38.700
what is your advice to those who are facing the same situation that you were facing?

0:09:38.700,0:09:43.340
I can honestly say, there are many living churches, but for us - if it wasn't for this ministry,

0:09:43.340,0:09:45.360
I do not know where our lives would have been.

0:09:45.360,0:09:51.400
So I can just encourage people to get linked up, watch Emmanuel TV, follow the Facebook page,

0:09:51.400,0:09:56.280
get the podcasts, try to get to The SCOAN, get to one of the branches, whatever you can do.

0:09:56.280,0:09:57.640
Distance is not a barrier.

0:09:57.640,0:10:02.140
Exactly - distance is not a barrier for Jesus Christ to touch you.

0:10:02.140,0:10:06.560
Can you please give us your advice after receiving your deliverance?

0:10:06.560,0:10:07.900
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:10:07.900,0:10:13.820
My advice to everyone out there is that you should open your heart to God's Word,

0:10:13.820,0:10:16.380
to His Spirit, and to His faith.

0:10:16.380,0:10:20.420
God can take you from where you are now to where He wants you to be.

0:10:20.420,0:10:21.920
Just be open.

0:10:21.920,0:10:29.060
