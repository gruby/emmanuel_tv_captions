0:00:00.160,0:00:05.720
This was the condition of Pastor Frederick when he came to The SCOAN.

0:00:05.720,0:00:12.100
He came all the way from Kenya to The SCOAN unable to walk.

0:00:12.100,0:00:18.440
You can see the expression of pain on his face as he positions himself to crawl forward.

0:00:18.440,0:00:24.460
Falling on his hands and knees, this is the only way Pastor Frederick could move by himself

0:00:24.460,0:00:28.120
when he arrived at The SCOAN.

0:00:28.120,0:00:34.800
The simple act of moving from one room to another, something that was once so easy for him to do

0:00:34.800,0:00:40.440
has become a tedious and very painful task.

0:00:40.440,0:00:56.560
Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"

0:00:56.560,0:01:02.620
You can see by the tense expression and sweat on his face just how difficult it is for him

0:01:02.620,0:01:07.700
to move from place to place without the assistance of another person.

0:01:07.700,0:01:22.480
Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"

0:01:22.480,0:01:28.980
He gradually makes his way towards the bed and with another gasp of pain and exertion

0:01:28.980,0:01:35.880
he awkwardly heaves himself up, onto the bed.

0:01:35.880,0:01:39.480
What could have made the pastor of a large ministry,

0:01:39.480,0:01:47.660
who just a week ago was energetically preaching at his pulpit now crawl on his hands and knees?

0:01:47.660,0:01:48.800
Let's hear from him.

0:01:48.800,0:01:52.100
I come from Nairobi, Kenya.

0:01:52.100,0:01:56.800
My name is Pastor Frederick.

0:01:56.800,0:01:59.880
I am a pastor and I used to pray for people.

0:01:59.880,0:02:03.080
Now I feel pain.

0:02:03.080,0:02:04.900
I can't walk.

0:02:04.900,0:02:09.200
I prayed and nothing has happened.

0:02:09.200,0:02:17.040
The name of our ministry is Word and Repentance Ministries, Nairobi, Kenya.

0:02:17.040,0:02:26.600
The reason why I came here – after preaching on Sunday, I had an attack in our church.

0:02:26.600,0:02:32.240
I had some pain in my left ankle.

0:02:32.240,0:02:34.060
I came by chance.

0:02:34.060,0:02:36.800
For now, I can't walk.

0:02:36.800,0:02:40.300
People have been helping me, to carry me but I don't want to bother them now.

0:02:40.300,0:02:44.040
I can't walk without any help.

0:02:44.040,0:02:47.140
Now I'm crawling like a baby.

0:02:47.140,0:02:49.720
From the toilet, I can't go alone.

0:02:49.720,0:02:53.420
I have to crawl like a baby.

0:02:53.420,0:02:55.420
You saw me a few minutes ago.

0:02:55.420,0:02:57.320
I could not walk alone.

0:02:57.320,0:03:01.040
I was just crawling because I don't want to bother people again to carry me.

0:03:01.040,0:03:02.320
Now I can't walk.

0:03:02.320,0:03:03.160
I feel pain.

0:03:03.160,0:03:04.940
Right now, I'm sitting down.

0:03:04.940,0:03:09.220
I want the man of God to pray for me so that I can walk.

0:03:09.220,0:03:12.860
This right ankle is painful.

0:03:12.860,0:03:17.540
You can see it's a bit swollen here.

0:03:17.540,0:03:21.160
Even now, it has come to my knee.

0:03:21.160,0:03:24.880
My knee is swollen. I can't fold it.

0:03:24.880,0:03:27.900
It is swollen.

0:03:27.900,0:03:29.960
Right now I can't walk.

0:03:29.960,0:03:32.140
I can't do anything.

0:03:32.140,0:03:33.420
I can't preach.

0:03:33.420,0:03:36.940
I'm sitting down, I'm just sleeping.

0:03:36.940,0:03:39.340
I can't do anything. I can't walk.

0:03:39.340,0:03:41.920
I'm just sleeping the whole day.

0:03:41.920,0:03:43.480
I feel a headache now.

0:03:43.480,0:03:48.300
We thank God Almighty for bringing you here to The SCOAN.

0:03:48.300,0:03:53.820
We believe with you that God Almighty will use the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to put an end

0:03:53.820,0:03:57.360
to these problems in your life today, in Jesus' name.

0:03:57.360,0:03:58.560
Amen.

WORD AND REPENTANCE CHURCH, Nairobi, Kenya, by Pastor Fredrick Okuku

0:04:05.880,0:04:10.760
What you are watching is a footage from Pastor Frederick's church - the Word and Repentance Ministry,

0:04:10.760,0:04:13.020
in Nairobi, Kenya.

0:04:13.020,0:04:16.120
This is the Word and Repentance Ministry in Nairobi.

0:04:16.120,0:04:21.240
You are watching clips from their recording of what took place during some of their Sunday services,

0:04:21.240,0:04:25.320
led by Pastor Frederick Okuku.

0:04:25.320,0:04:29.440
Pastor Frederick regards his ministry as a deliverance ministry.

0:04:29.440,0:04:33.300
You can see how he conducts himself among the congregation

0:04:33.300,0:04:38.180
and how he interacts with different people, with different problems.

0:04:38.180,0:04:46.040
Notice how he uses physical strength, pushing, pulling, and holding the different individuals,

0:04:46.040,0:04:49.040
in an attempt to deliver them.

0:04:49.040,0:04:56.880
But the Bible says, "It is not by power or by might but by My Spirit, says the Lord".

0:04:56.880,0:05:05.840
Healing, deliverance, blessing and salvation are not brought to pass by anything done by man.

0:05:05.840,0:05:14.840
What we receive of Jesus Christ is not a mere product of any man's natural ability or power.

0:05:14.840,0:05:24.220
While man has the ability to preach, to speak and to touch on the outside, it is the Holy Spirit who heals,

0:05:24.220,0:05:29.440
saves, blesses and delivers as He wills.

0:05:29.440,0:05:37.720
Therefore, ministers of God must be under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit at all times.

0:05:37.720,0:05:39.980
Where God guides He provides.

0:05:39.980,0:05:46.900
Where God leads, His solution, provision and protection be.

0:05:46.900,0:05:52.460
This was how the services at the Word and Repentance Ministry had been going on for some time.

0:05:52.460,0:05:58.780
But one day, Pastor Frederick met with a stiff opposition.

0:05:58.780,0:06:03.700
During the service a woman possessing 7 evil spirits came forward.

0:06:03.700,0:06:08.080
But this was not the end of the encounter.

0:06:08.080,0:06:13.860
Events which may seem ordinary can have extraordinary effects in the spirit,

0:06:13.860,0:06:16.540
much of which are hidden to the ordinary eye.

0:06:16.540,0:06:20.860
After the demons had warned Pastor Frederick to leave them alone,

0:06:20.860,0:06:24.640
when he persisted, they threatened to destroy him.

0:06:24.640,0:06:30.340
Not unlike the 7 sons of Sceva, when asked by Pastor Frederick, "Do you know me?",

0:06:30.340,0:06:35.360
the demons repeatedly replied, "No".

0:06:35.360,0:06:42.340
Demons can recognize imposters and can distinguish them from those with real spiritual power.

0:06:42.340,0:06:48.980
This is a reminder that demons are real, and Christianity is not to be practised as a hobby,

0:06:48.980,0:06:52.540
for there is danger in it.

0:06:52.540,0:06:59.200
Let's watch the encounter between Pastor Frederick and the demon-possessed woman.

0:06:59.200,0:07:02.600
Come out you sickness.

0:07:02.600,0:07:06.520
Contrary spirit, I command you, come out.

0:07:06.520,0:07:12.960
Every sickness, I command you, come out.

0:07:12.960,0:07:16.040
Look at my eyes, look there, look here.

0:07:16.040,0:07:17.740
Stop looking sideways.

0:07:17.740,0:07:19.160
Look at me.

0:07:19.160,0:07:20.280
You are going?

0:07:20.280,0:07:21.300
Yes.

0:07:21.300,0:07:23.760
Manifestation. What is making her to talk?

0:07:23.760,0:07:26.120
Who can answer me?

0:07:26.120,0:07:27.060
We are seven.

0:07:27.060,0:07:28.840
You are seven?

0:07:28.840,0:07:33.480
Yes, we are seven.

0:07:33.480,0:07:36.060
I'm telling you, we are seven.

0:07:36.060,0:07:40.700
What is she saying?

0:07:40.700,0:07:41.820
How many are you here?

0:07:41.820,0:07:43.160
We are seven.

0:07:43.160,0:07:44.340
You are not listening.

0:07:44.340,0:07:47.060
You! Don't disturb me!

0:07:47.060,0:07:48.860
You want to "pick" me?

0:07:48.860,0:07:50.280
Come!

0:07:50.280,0:07:51.300
OK, I'm coming.

0:07:51.300,0:07:52.440
No!

WORD AND REPENTANCE CHURCH - NAIROBI, KENYA

0:08:02.160,0:08:02.920
Do you know me?

0:08:02.920,0:08:04.280
No, no, no, no.

0:08:04.280,0:08:05.100
Do you know me?

0:08:05.100,0:08:05.760
Open your eyes.

0:08:05.760,0:08:07.980
Do you know me?

0:08:07.980,0:08:08.800
Open your eyes.

0:08:08.800,0:08:09.480
No.

0:08:09.480,0:08:11.060
If you are powerful, open your eyes.

0:08:11.060,0:08:11.760
No.

0:08:11.760,0:08:13.880
She has refused to open her eyes.

0:08:13.880,0:08:15.280
No.

0:08:15.280,0:08:19.060
Leave me alone.

We will destroy you.

0:08:46.320,0:08:50.720
You are the one who has been killing people.

0:08:50.720,0:08:54.240
Those who have been delivering you have been dying.

0:08:54.240,0:08:56.540
Do you want to kill me?

0:08:56.540,0:08:59.260
Come and kill me.

0:08:59.260,0:09:22.180
Deliverance Time

0:09:22.180,0:09:23.580
Kill me too.

0:09:23.580,0:09:25.740
Are you not the ones who kill pastors?

0:09:25.740,0:09:30.480
Those who tried to deliver you, you killed them.

0:09:30.480,0:10:03.980
Deliverance Time

0:10:03.980,0:10:06.300
Raise up your handkerchiefs to impact it with fire.

0:10:06.300,0:10:10.920
That night after the service, he was attacked by the evil spirits

0:10:10.920,0:10:14.900
and found himself unable to walk the next morning.

0:10:14.900,0:10:21.380
For the first time it dawned on Pastor Frederick that he was on a dangerous mission.

0:10:21.380,0:10:27.000
Immediately, Pastor Frederick set about making his way to The SCOAN

0:10:27.000,0:10:32.560
in Lagos, Nigeria, in search of a solution.

0:10:32.560,0:10:39.140
On Sunday, Pastor Frederick was assisted to the prayer line to receive prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:10:39.140,0:10:41.380
He calls out for help.

0:10:41.380,0:10:45.780
You are now watching footage of how Pastor Frederick was aided by two men

0:10:45.780,0:10:48.400
to get to the prayer line that Sunday morning.

0:10:48.400,0:11:02.480
Not my brother but it's me, oh Lord, 'cos I'm standing in the need of prayer.

0:11:02.480,0:11:06.900
It's me...

0:11:06.900,0:11:10.840
They have come to God's presence today, to the arena of liberty to be set free.

0:11:10.840,0:11:15.000
Man of God, help me. I want to walk.

0:11:15.000,0:11:16.820
I cannot walk.

0:11:16.820,0:11:20.940
There were some agents who came to the church and said they had come to attack me.

0:11:20.940,0:11:23.000
They said they were coming to attack you in the church?

0:11:23.000,0:11:23.860
Yes.

0:11:23.860,0:11:25.680
They said they will attack me.

0:11:25.680,0:11:27.460
And they attacked you?

0:11:27.460,0:11:28.760
Yes.

0:11:28.760,0:11:30.680
Let us see how you walk.

0:11:30.680,0:11:32.900
This is a pastor from Kenya.

0:11:32.900,0:11:35.760
This is how I was going to the toilet.

0:11:35.760,0:11:37.360
It was hard for me.

0:11:37.360,0:11:42.820
Father, let Your name be glorified.

0:11:42.820,0:11:44.800
Come on, look here.

0:11:44.800,0:11:47.680
Stand up.

0:11:47.680,0:11:51.500
Just stand up.

0:11:51.500,0:11:57.680
This was the man who could not rise to his feet without someone supporting him.

0:11:57.680,0:12:04.820
About 3 to 4 people brought him here today all the way from Kenya.

0:12:04.820,0:12:06.560
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:06.560,0:12:11.080
OK, come.

0:12:11.080,0:12:13.720
This is a pastor from Kenya.

0:12:13.720,0:12:18.380
Deliverance Time

0:12:18.380,0:12:21.120
Watch your screen and see what is happening.

0:12:21.120,0:12:27.120
Total deliverance from that severe evil attack.

0:12:27.120,0:12:30.700
Right now the man of God said, "Walk, in the name of Jesus Christ".

0:12:30.700,0:12:32.280
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:32.280,0:12:39.040
I can now walk.

0:12:39.040,0:12:41.100
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:41.100,0:12:45.720
I am free. I will preach now.

0:12:45.720,0:12:47.480
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:47.480,0:12:52.740
Can we see how he was carried here today?

0:12:52.740,0:12:57.180
Very soon we are going to watch his condition before now.

0:12:57.180,0:12:59.560
Can you come here now? Come to the seat now.

0:12:59.560,0:13:01.380
Let's watch the video.

0:13:01.380,0:13:10.200
Right now you can see the man walking by himself without any support.

0:13:10.200,0:13:17.180
Thank You, Jesus.
I am free.

0:13:17.180,0:13:19.500
I am healed. Thank You, Jesus.

0:13:19.500,0:13:22.480
Man of God, I sold the church keyboard for me to come here.

0:13:22.480,0:13:24.400
People were contributing money.

0:13:24.400,0:13:28.980
You sold the keyboard of the church to buy the ticket?

0:13:28.980,0:13:33.380
To buy the ticket because they were even fighting financially.

0:13:33.380,0:13:37.620
Here is the keyboard from Pastor Frederick's church, which he sold in order to purchase the ticket

0:13:37.620,0:13:40.820
to come to The SCOAN in Lagos.

0:13:40.820,0:13:46.860
These are the members of his congregation, who also contributed funds towards his flight ticket, so that

0:13:46.860,0:13:54.160
he could come for deliverance, having been spiritually attacked after one of his Sunday services.

0:13:54.160,0:13:55.340
They fought you financially?

0:13:55.340,0:13:57.540
I help people.

0:13:57.540,0:13:59.520
No, no, no, no. They are not fighting you.

0:13:59.520,0:14:03.480
I think your anointing is questionable.

0:14:03.480,0:14:07.720
I don't want you to say anything against the anointing of God.

0:14:07.720,0:14:08.460
Yes, sir.

0:14:08.460,0:14:10.780
OK. You begin to tell me that because you help people

0:14:10.780,0:14:16.280
- that is why they attacked you, you were attacked financially, health-wise.

0:14:16.280,0:14:18.580
Who are you? Am I not helping people?

0:14:18.580,0:14:21.660
Your calling is questionable.

0:14:21.660,0:14:29.540
Now, we have to sit down and ask God, Lord Jesus for His mercy and His favour.

0:14:29.540,0:14:34.940
You have a passion for His Word, and I know this is your desire now.

0:14:34.940,0:14:36.640
We will pray together. OK?

0:14:36.640,0:14:37.860
Yes, sir.

0:14:37.860,0:14:39.440
What you are saying now is blasphemy.

0:14:39.440,0:14:40.400
Forgive me, sir.

0:14:40.400,0:14:42.120
Ask God to forgive you.

0:14:42.120,0:14:45.060
Don't ever say that because you help people, you were attacked.

0:14:45.060,0:14:47.340
Where is Jesus then?

0:14:47.340,0:14:48.720
Is it your power?

0:14:48.720,0:14:49.360
No.

0:14:49.360,0:14:52.500
If you are attacked, they attack Jesus.

0:14:52.500,0:14:56.760
If they beat you, they beat Jesus -  if you are really from Jesus.

0:14:56.760,0:14:58.820
Yes.

0:14:58.820,0:15:02.440
Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"

0:15:02.440,0:15:07.100
I am not saying you don't have a calling but there is something wrong somewhere.

0:15:07.100,0:15:10.100
So, don't complain again that you help people and that's why they attacked you.

0:15:10.100,0:15:11.340
It is blasphemy.

0:15:11.340,0:15:11.880
Thank you.

0:15:11.880,0:15:12.600
OK.

0:15:12.600,0:15:16.200
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:15:16.200,0:15:27.980
We are not doing this for any reason but as a lesson for me, number one, and a lesson for you, number two.

0:15:27.980,0:15:32.140
Seven sons of Sceva - like I have told you...

0:15:32.140,0:15:45.760
This use of the name Jesus inspired them to try using the same name as an incantation.

0:15:45.760,0:15:54.000
When they were saying, 'In the name of Jesus, God of Paul, whom Paul called'

0:15:54.000,0:16:00.360
and satan said to them, 'We know Jesus, we know God of Paul, who are you?'

0:16:00.360,0:16:03.240
This is exactly what happened here.

0:16:03.240,0:16:13.400
You may be doing it for 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 years,

0:16:13.400,0:16:20.460
but when the repercussion comes, it will be so great that people can see that

0:16:20.460,0:16:28.640
'Look, with what you are doing in the name of Jesus - why this?'

0:16:28.640,0:16:35.560
After that, we'll now pray for our pastor and tell the pastor here, his calling.

0:16:35.560,0:16:45.820
He should not go beyond his calling.

0:16:45.820,0:16:52.120
Preach the Gospel, sing wonderful songs God has given you.

0:16:52.120,0:16:57.900
When it is time to pray, offer the prayer and leave them for their faith.

0:16:57.900,0:17:05.040
Don't call anybody and begin to perform one-on-one prayer - it is dangerous if you don't have that calling.

0:17:05.040,0:17:13.760
When it is time for deliverance, pray and call the power of God to descend on those contrary spirits.

0:17:13.760,0:17:15.560
It will happen.

0:17:15.560,0:17:20.140
Not going into their midst - it is a different anointing.

0:17:20.140,0:17:26.260
It is great going into their midst and to begin to have a personal encounter with these people.

0:17:26.260,0:17:38.720
It is the most dangerous thing.

0:17:38.720,0:17:43.680
When you have the anointing to provoke them, you can go and provoke them.

0:17:43.680,0:17:56.620
When it comes to responsibility from God, the more your faithfulness, the more your responsibility.

0:17:56.620,0:18:03.620
If your faithfulness is reducing, your responsibility will also reduce.

0:18:03.620,0:18:06.360
My pastor - this is what I want you to know.

0:18:06.360,0:18:08.740
We will pray with you, the congregation will pray with you.

0:18:08.740,0:18:10.280
We will pray for your ministry.

0:18:10.280,0:18:13.420
Your ministry will remain.

0:18:13.420,0:18:15.500
Nothing will happen to your ministry.

0:18:15.500,0:18:19.100
What happened to you is to strengthen your desire.

0:18:19.100,0:18:22.200
It's not meant to destroy your ministry.

0:18:22.200,0:18:29.120
This is the time to be closer to God so that you can hear God louder.

0:18:29.120,0:18:33.920
Before now, you heard God loud but not louder.

0:18:33.920,0:18:44.140
When you get back to Kenya, start trusting in God's authority, not majority.

0:18:44.140,0:18:47.900
The problem you people have is that you trust majority.

0:18:47.900,0:18:54.360
Be closer to God, go to the mountain, have a place to pray.

0:18:54.360,0:18:58.020
Your life must be full of prayer.

0:18:58.020,0:19:04.260
Have more devotion, more commitment, more prayer.

0:19:04.260,0:19:10.160
The first place where we have to prosper in the Church is our spiritual life.

0:19:10.160,0:19:15.340
TESTIMONY TIME

0:19:15.340,0:19:17.440
My name is Pastor Frederick Okuku.

0:19:17.440,0:19:20.880
I am from Kenya.

0:19:20.880,0:19:30.600
I really love the man of God ever since I saw his tape and I started watching him on Emmanuel TV.

0:19:30.600,0:19:38.700
I was inspired by his ministry and I really liked what he was doing.

0:19:38.700,0:19:39.720
I couldn't walk.

0:19:39.720,0:19:46.220
What happened was that after prayer, I felt a pain on my left ankle.

0:19:46.220,0:19:49.080
They decided to take me to the airport.

0:19:49.080,0:19:53.280
I arrived here, I could not walk. I was taken to the room.

0:19:53.280,0:20:01.800
It was difficult for me to walk but after the  prayer - it was like a twinkle of an eye - I received my healing.

0:20:01.800,0:20:04.680
And not only that.

0:20:04.680,0:20:13.460
After the prayer, my wife called me from Kenya and told me that one of my sons could not go to the toilet,

0:20:13.460,0:20:16.700
could not pass urine, that I must help her with prayer.

0:20:16.700,0:20:20.220
I said I would not hide it from the man of God. I would tell him straight away.

0:20:20.220,0:20:21.800
She then said, "Okay".

0:20:21.800,0:20:24.980
He stretched his hand and told me to go and call her back.

0:20:24.980,0:20:34.020
Immediately, when I called her back, my wife told me that the boy was OK; he has passed urine.

0:20:34.020,0:20:36.420
After the prayer, I got healed; I'm OK.

0:20:36.420,0:20:38.600
Now, I can do anything.

0:20:38.600,0:20:41.520
Can you do those things you couldn't do before?

0:20:41.520,0:20:48.140
Hallelujah. Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus!

0:20:48.140,0:20:54.900
I want to warn men of God not to imitate because what they don't know, they speak about it

0:20:54.900,0:20:56.680
and what they know, they destroy.

0:20:56.680,0:20:59.460
This one cannot be destroyed.

0:20:59.460,0:21:02.360
That's why I came here.

0:21:02.360,0:21:07.200
I thank God for everything because my past is over.

0:21:07.200,0:21:10.820
Wait for God's time because God's time is the best time.

0:21:10.820,0:21:13.080
Stop imitating any man of God.

0:21:13.080,0:21:16.820
If God has called you, just do it the way He has called you.

0:21:16.820,0:21:21.100
God will not "certify" your calling and leave you.

0:21:21.100,0:21:23.920
He will fight until the end.

0:21:23.920,0:21:29.700
I'm also a gospel singer and I would like to sing for the Lord for what He has done for me.

0:21:29.700,0:21:31.340
I have a Father

0:23:16.820,0:23:22.320
Let us pray for our evangelist.

0:23:22.320,0:23:30.640
Before the prayer, like I have said - a lesson to everyone of us.

0:23:30.640,0:23:41.260
Don’t say, "Amen" because somebody says, "In the name of Jesus".

0:23:41.260,0:23:44.540
Say "Amen" because you believe.

0:23:44.540,0:23:53.380
Tell your neighbour, "Don't say 'Amen' because the pastor says, 'In the name of Jesus'.

0:23:53.380,0:23:59.120
Say 'Amen' because you believe.

0:23:59.120,0:24:09.240
Don't say 'Amen' because T.B. Joshua says, 'In the name of Jesus'.

0:24:09.240,0:24:16.260
Say 'Amen' because you believe".

0:24:16.260,0:24:24.180
Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"

0:24:24.180,0:24:35.440
Stretch your hand and pray for the church, pray for the evangelist.

0:24:35.440,0:24:39.300
In Jesus Christ's name, we pray!

0:24:39.300,0:24:42.060
[Amen.]

0:24:42.060,0:24:45.640
Evangelist, stand up.

0:24:45.640,0:24:47.900
Stretch your hand.

0:24:47.900,0:24:53.340
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
