0:00:00.000,0:00:03.240
When you leave here where are you going, Madam?

0:00:03.240,0:00:04.900
Yola.

0:00:04.900,0:00:07.600
To whom?

0:00:07.600,0:00:09.420
I stay with my mum.

0:00:09.420,0:00:13.480
Because I’m seeing you living on your own.

0:00:13.480,0:00:16.380
What is wrong with you?

0:00:16.380,0:00:17.880
You are frustrated.

0:00:17.880,0:00:19.140
Yes, sir.

0:00:19.140,0:00:23.600
And this frustration has led you to do many things which you don’t want to do.

0:00:23.600,0:00:24.660
Yes, sir.

0:00:24.660,0:00:26.280
And you are tired now.

0:00:26.280,0:00:28.500
Yes, sir.

0:00:28.500,0:00:33.640
There was a man you were with for some time and you left.

0:00:33.640,0:00:35.040
- Yes, sir.
- What happened?

0:00:35.040,0:00:39.200
There was something you discovered.

0:00:39.200,0:00:40.000
This is your daughter.

0:00:40.000,0:00:41.160
Yes, sir.

0:00:41.160,0:00:43.980
I say that your daughter is a troubled daughter.

0:00:43.980,0:00:45.540
Yes, sir.

0:00:45.540,0:00:49.240
I have problems.
We came all the way from Yola.

0:00:49.240,0:00:50.540
We came from Yola.

0:00:50.540,0:00:52.000
You don’t know what is happening.

0:00:52.000,0:00:55.140
Yes, sir, I don’t know even in my own life.

0:00:55.140,0:00:56.860
Let's go.

0:00:56.860,0:01:02.800
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:01:02.800,0:01:06.340
My name is Doris.
I am from Yola.

0:01:06.340,0:01:12.460
Last week Sunday, the Man of God walked up to me and prophesied.

0:01:12.460,0:01:16.260
He asked me where I was going from here.

0:01:16.260,0:01:21.440
He saw me living alone and that I was frustrated and tired.

0:01:21.440,0:01:25.640
That has caused me to do things that I did not want to do.

0:01:25.640,0:01:29.900
He said that I broke up with a man because I discovered something

0:01:29.900,0:01:36.000
and that I was a troubled daughter which was very true and correct.

0:01:36.000,0:01:43.640
When he asked me where I was going from here, I said Yola but in Yola things were so difficult for us.

0:01:43.640,0:01:49.320
Our rent has expired and we have no money to pay for the house rent.

0:01:49.320,0:01:55.620
People look at me as if I was OK and as if I have money but I had nothing.

0:01:55.620,0:01:58.720
This caused frustration.

0:01:58.720,0:02:05.320
I even tried to stab myself many times to kill myself but my mum would come and hold me.

0:02:05.320,0:02:12.080
I was just tired of the life I was living.

0:02:12.080,0:02:15.820
I have no work, nothing.

0:02:15.820,0:02:23.740
Look at me; I ought to be married but no man is coming.

0:02:23.740,0:02:28.480
So, what the man of God said concerning you was correct while asking where were you going -

0:02:28.480,0:02:30.700
you actually have nowhere to go now.

0:02:30.700,0:02:31.840
Yes.

0:02:31.840,0:02:35.160
OK. Can we hear a word or two from your mother?

0:02:35.160,0:02:41.840
I believe she also has something to say

0:02:41.840,0:02:43.960
Emmanuel!
(God with us – Matthew 1:23)

0:02:43.960,0:02:45.820
We are from Yola.

0:02:45.820,0:02:53.620
When we came here, the man of God prophesied to my daughter that she was a troubled daughter.

0:02:53.620,0:02:59.540
Then, I got up and said yes and even myself.

0:02:59.540,0:03:02.440
Later, the man of God said that we should come and see him.

0:03:02.440,0:03:04.380
So, our lives are miserable.

0:03:04.380,0:03:06.340
Even when he asked where we were going to…

0:03:06.340,0:03:08.780
We have nowhere to go.
We have no destination.

0:03:08.780,0:03:12.780
We have nowhere to go because right now, we have nothing.

0:03:12.780,0:03:16.660
She wants to kill herself; she wants to stab herself.

0:03:16.660,0:03:19.840
Anytime she takes a knife to kill herself, I would hold her.

0:03:19.840,0:03:23.220
I would talk to her saying that she should believe in God because

0:03:23.220,0:03:26.940
God is the God that makes impossible possible.

0:03:26.940,0:03:32.880
Before we came here, I was thinking how it would be possible for us to come because there was no way.

0:03:32.880,0:03:35.100
Somebody gave me some things to sell.

0:03:35.100,0:03:40.780
I then took her and said, come, let's run to our father, T.B. Joshua.

0:03:40.780,0:03:44.420
I think this is the last bus stop.

0:03:44.420,0:03:46.380
So, madam, we just want to hear from you.

0:03:46.380,0:03:50.480
You can see the old woman shedding tears because of the situation they have been in, for years.

0:03:50.480,0:03:56.060
You said the man of God had prophesied that your daughter was a troubled child.

0:03:56.060,0:04:01.720
Can you tell us more about these troubles that your child was facing, before the prophecy was given,

0:04:01.720,0:04:04.380
during the last service?

0:04:04.380,0:04:09.800
The trouble she is facing is that she has no job, no husband or helper.

0:04:09.800,0:04:12.640
Even to eat is difficult and she has no house.

0:04:12.640,0:04:16.180
So, she decided that she was going to kill herself.

0:04:16.180,0:04:18.360
Several times, I’ve collected the knife from her.

0:04:18.360,0:04:21.480
Even rat poison – she would say she would drink it and I’d collect it from her.

0:04:21.480,0:04:26.660
The troubles of your child - how they affected you, as a mother?

0:04:26.660,0:04:31.360
It has affected me. 
Even right now, I am having heart problems.

0:04:31.360,0:04:35.460
The mother and the lady - when you listen to them...

0:04:35.460,0:04:42.500
You cannot blame them for their misfortune.

0:04:42.500,0:04:48.420
When we work, God still has to examine it.

0:04:48.420,0:05:00.120
That is; after you have done everything, humanly, God would still have to go through it and mark it.

0:05:00.120,0:05:01.460
Can you see?

0:05:01.460,0:05:10.560
After you have done it perfectly to you, you cannot say, "It's alright".

0:05:10.560,0:05:17.040
God still will go through it and mark it one by one.

0:05:17.040,0:05:20.360
That is what you call grace.

0:05:20.380,0:05:33.120
After you have moved or walked you say, "Yes, I do it perfectly" - as a Christian, that language is not right.

0:05:33.120,0:05:35.460
Yes.

0:05:35.460,0:05:42.780
As Christians we live under the grace - the grace covers us.

0:05:42.780,0:05:49.960
After you have moved or walked, done everything you could humanly,

0:05:49.960,0:05:55.020
and you say this was a right thing you have done - leave it for God.

0:05:55.020,0:05:56.740
God will still have to what?

0:05:56.740,0:05:59.600
Mark it.

0:05:59.600,0:06:12.320
So, it is up to God to give you a mark, whether it is 90%, 50%, 40% or ... it is over to God.

0:06:12.320,0:06:15.160
This is grace.

0:06:15.160,0:06:23.780
If anyone now say that this family is to be blamed, or you ask them, "You have hands and legs -

0:06:23.780,0:06:27.700
why can't you go and work?"

0:06:27.700,0:06:36.920
You need to ask yourself by what authority you achieved what you achieved.

0:06:36.920,0:06:39.640
The women - they have nowhere to live.

0:06:39.640,0:06:50.340
Mere look at their appearance and attire - very expensive and good looking -

0:06:50.340,0:06:58.120
but that could not confuse the Spirit of God.

0:06:58.120,0:07:05.280
The attire and everything were of the past glory.

0:07:05.280,0:07:06.360
Past what?

0:07:06.360,0:07:07.120
(Glory.)

0:07:07.120,0:07:11.820
Past glory - those things they had in the past.

0:07:11.820,0:07:16.160
So, the mother and the daughter...

0:07:16.160,0:07:21.460
We have learned that the house rent is not less that N200,000.

0:07:21.460,0:07:25.880
They should give them N500,000 to start something.

0:07:25.880,0:07:31.320
PITIFUL: Elderly Mother Finds Daughter Drinking Rat Poison!!!

0:07:31.320,0:07:40.120
The man of God said the sum of N500,000 should be given to them to support the woman and her daughter.

0:07:40.120,0:07:43.820
PITIFUL: Elderly Mother Finds Daughter Drinking Rat Poison!!!

0:07:43.820,0:07:49.100
You can see the woman's tears of joy that leak on her cheek.
