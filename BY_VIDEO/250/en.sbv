0:00:00.000,0:00:08.100
We shall talk about faith today.

0:00:08.100,0:00:17.660
What is faith?

0:00:17.660,0:00:49.540
Faith is the evidence of things hoped for.

0:00:49.540,0:00:52.640
One thing is clear about faith:

0:00:52.640,0:00:57.200
Faith is in the present tense.

0:00:57.200,0:01:00.940
Take note of that.

0:01:00.940,0:01:18.120
Faith is in the present tense.

0:01:18.120,0:01:24.000
And what are the promises?

0:01:24.000,0:01:37.740
It receives now.

0:01:37.740,0:01:41.660
Take note of that.

0:01:41.660,0:01:51.820
It acts now.

0:01:51.820,0:02:01.940
It believes now.

0:02:01.940,0:02:04.600
Now, now, now.

0:02:04.600,0:02:07.680
Our God is God of now.

0:02:07.680,0:02:12.920
Tell your neighbour: My God is God of now.

0:02:12.920,0:02:15.220
He is now.

0:02:15.220,0:02:17.220
He blesses now.

0:02:17.220,0:02:19.720
He saves now.

0:02:19.720,0:02:21.800
Thank you.

0:02:21.800,0:02:29.900
WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua

0:02:29.900,0:03:03.240
Faith is the unshakable confidence in the reality of the unseen world.

0:03:03.240,0:03:05.920
Take note of that.

0:03:05.920,0:03:22.960
Faith is the unshakable confidence in the reality of the unseen world.

0:03:22.960,0:04:17.820
Three: The certainty of God's yet unfulfilled promises.

0:04:17.820,0:05:02.220
It is a firm expectation of what God promised us in Christ Jesus.

0:05:02.220,0:05:08.160
Now we have said so much about the definition.

0:05:08.160,0:05:14.440
Let us take it now one by one and explain it.

0:05:14.440,0:05:21.320
When we say faith with what we have heard now,

0:05:21.320,0:05:29.640
what is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.

0:05:29.640,0:05:48.520
What is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.

0:05:48.520,0:06:03.900
Let's now talk of what are those things unseen and those things seen.

0:06:03.900,0:06:09.300
I will take it from the world you are in now.

0:06:09.300,0:06:25.940
This world was not built out of what is seen but out of what is unseen.

0:06:25.940,0:07:01.320
If God had relied on what is seen, He would have nothing to build on.

0:07:01.320,0:07:11.700
What we read in Genesis, the world was formless, void.

0:07:11.700,0:08:13.680
What God relied on was faith in Himself, which was unseen.

0:08:13.680,0:09:04.760
It was that faith that found expression in the spoken word

0:09:04.760,0:09:24.640
which He used in creating the world.

0:09:24.640,0:09:31.400
In other words:

0:09:31.400,0:09:40.220
What is seen came into being from what is unseen.

0:09:40.220,0:09:46.520
What we are looking at - look here.

0:09:46.520,0:09:51.780
Pen or anything else you can talk of.

0:09:51.780,0:10:01.340
What is seen today came into being from what is unseen.

0:10:01.340,0:10:16.660
And what is unseen is faith.

0:10:16.660,0:10:43.220
What is seen today came into being from what is unseen.

0:10:43.220,0:10:50.360
My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes

0:10:50.360,0:10:51.420
Let's rise up.

0:10:51.420,0:10:59.700
My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes

0:10:59.700,0:11:00.940
Touch them.

0:11:00.940,0:11:11.440
My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes -

0:11:11.440,0:11:21.820
they all belong to Jesus!

0:11:21.820,0:11:23.400
Once again.

0:11:23.400,0:11:56.000
My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes -

0:11:56.000,0:12:07.700
they all belong to Jesus!

0:12:07.700,0:12:12.000
Remember the book of Hebrews.

0:12:12.000,0:12:16.580
Only faith pleases Him.

0:12:16.580,0:12:23.460
When you are talking of God, you are talking of faith.

0:12:23.460,0:12:26.560
It means, they all belong to faith.

0:12:26.560,0:12:28.940
They come by faith.

0:12:28.940,0:12:32.240
An example of what is seen is you.

0:12:32.240,0:12:37.780
Tell your neighbour: An example of what is seen is you.

0:12:37.780,0:12:39.520
Tell your neighbour once again.

0:12:39.520,0:12:41.760
An example of what is seen is you.

0:12:41.760,0:12:42.660
Once again.

0:12:42.660,0:12:44.900
An example of what is seen is you.

0:12:44.900,0:12:45.900
Once again.

0:12:45.900,0:12:48.280
An example of what is seen is you.

0:12:48.280,0:12:53.400
It means, you came into being from what is unseen

0:12:53.400,0:12:57.500
and you return to the unseen world.

0:12:57.500,0:12:58.900
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:58.900,0:13:06.680
Say, I will return to the unseen world.

0:13:06.680,0:13:13.260
You will return one day to the unseen world.

0:13:13.260,0:13:18.200
And the head of the community of the unseen world is Jesus.

0:13:18.200,0:13:22.040
You will return to the unseen community

0:13:22.040,0:13:24.040
Have your seat.

0:13:24.040,0:13:29.860
WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua

0:13:29.860,0:13:35.760
I'm a good example of what is seen - you can see me.

0:13:35.760,0:13:45.120
But when a person passes on, he or she becomes unseen.

0:13:45.120,0:13:51.940
When you say, this person is late, you will not see him or her again.

0:13:51.940,0:14:03.580
Back to where he came from.

0:14:03.580,0:14:13.280
What is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.

0:14:13.280,0:14:21.180
What is seen today came into being from what is unseen.

0:14:21.180,0:14:28.220
What is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.

0:14:28.220,0:14:32.720
I want to clean all of it.

0:14:32.720,0:14:37.180
What is unseen - can you see?

0:14:37.180,0:14:41.180
What is unseen --

0:14:41.180,0:14:44.460
My two legs can be seen.

0:14:44.460,0:14:47.420
My head is unseen.

0:14:47.420,0:14:50.760
Came to seen.

0:14:50.760,0:14:56.940
WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua

0:14:56.940,0:15:00.220
Came to being.

0:15:00.220,0:15:14.520
When we say what is unseen - what is unseen is eternal.

0:15:14.520,0:15:19.640
Eternal life

0:15:19.640,0:15:25.440
I want to live eternal life

0:15:25.440,0:15:30.280
God save my soul

0:15:30.280,0:15:36.780
I want to live eternal life

0:15:36.780,0:15:43.800
God save my soul

0:15:43.800,0:15:49.780
Faith is unseen.

0:15:49.780,0:16:19.460
If you must have faith, you must learn to hear God's Word

0:16:19.460,0:16:41.560
because faith acts on God's Word.

0:16:41.560,0:16:48.080
If you must have faith, you must learn to hear God's Word

0:16:48.080,0:16:56.060
because faith acts on God's Word.

0:16:56.060,0:17:00.800
The opposite of faith is feeling.

0:17:00.800,0:17:08.160
Nearly everyone acts on feeling but they don't know.

0:17:08.160,0:17:19.580
If you say you believe Jesus, you must have confidence in His ability to save, to heal, to deliver.

0:17:19.580,0:17:24.480
You believe in Jesus but you don't have confidence in His ability.

0:17:24.480,0:17:28.440
Even though you have confidence in His ability,

0:17:28.440,0:17:33.740
you have confidence in His ability when the goings are good.

0:17:33.740,0:17:40.760
When the goings are tough - no!

0:17:40.760,0:17:45.080
If I believe in Jesus as my Lord and Saviour,

0:17:45.080,0:17:52.740
I should have confidence in His ability to save, even in the face of trials.

0:17:52.740,0:18:01.320
Even in the face of difficulty, I should have confidence in His ability to protect.

0:18:01.320,0:18:05.600
But opposite is the case today.

0:18:05.600,0:18:08.400
Let's talk about your problem.

0:18:08.400,0:18:11.760
What is your problem?

0:18:11.760,0:18:17.500
You think you are acting faith but acting feeling.

0:18:17.500,0:18:21.700
You don't know the difference between feeling and faith.

0:18:21.700,0:18:25.080
As a Christian, you don't know.

0:18:25.080,0:18:35.960
The consequence, the result, the outcome, the product of faith

0:18:35.960,0:18:49.880
are not only emotional but also affect the realm of the mind.

0:18:49.880,0:19:29.300
The result of faith is not only emotional but also affects the realm of the mind.

0:19:29.300,0:19:44.300
That is, as a man of faith, what is happening around me, does not determine my comfort,

0:19:44.300,0:19:47.600
does not determine my peace.

0:19:47.600,0:19:54.060
When you have the kind of faith I'm talking about,

0:19:54.060,0:19:57.680
you will be fulfilled in Christ.

0:19:57.680,0:20:03.680
And when you are fulfilled in Christ, you lack nothing and you want nothing.

0:20:03.680,0:20:07.900
The Lord is my Sheperd - tell your neighbour -

0:20:07.900,0:20:10.480
I shall not want.

0:20:10.480,0:20:12.220
What is the meaning of that?

0:20:12.220,0:20:15.540
When you say, the Lord is your Sheperd, you shall not want,

0:20:15.540,0:20:16.980
what is the meaning?

0:20:16.980,0:20:19.280
When you are beside the still water -

0:20:19.280,0:20:24.800
this water that does not worry; calm.

0:20:24.800,0:20:27.540
When you move close to the still water, you will be afraid

0:20:27.540,0:20:33.760
because you will not hear the noise; even the fish in the sea will not disturb the sea.

0:20:33.760,0:20:40.880
When you are beside this still water, you will have a situation without panic,

0:20:40.880,0:20:48.220
a situation without fear, a situation without worry, pressure and tension.

0:20:48.220,0:20:55.420
How many of us have this kind of situation?

0:20:55.420,0:21:01.500
Just like what happened at the graveside of Lazarus.

0:21:01.500,0:21:06.300
Ordinarily, the situation did not call for thanksgiving.

0:21:06.300,0:21:13.380
But Jesus went there and saw a body in the tomb and said, "Thank You, Lord!"

0:21:13.380,0:21:16.400
The pharisees said, "Thank You for what?

0:21:16.400,0:21:21.380
We called you to come and raise the body and you say, 'Thank You, Lord'.

0:21:21.380,0:21:23.820
Oh, you mean, thank you for killing him?

0:21:23.820,0:21:26.040
Thank you for the death of our brother?

0:21:26.040,0:21:28.580
You mean, thank you for the body on the ground?

0:21:28.580,0:21:30.700
Thank you - for what?"

0:21:30.700,0:21:35.000
They were expecting Jesus to join them crying.

0:21:35.000,0:21:45.080
The result of faith is not only emotional but also affects the realm of the mind.

0:21:45.080,0:21:53.220
A man of faith may look poor but still happy.

0:21:53.220,0:22:01.760
A man of faith may look so dejected to people; they say, he is lonely.

0:22:01.760,0:22:04.540
But you see him smiling.

0:22:04.540,0:22:06.420
You meet him, "Brother, what is your problem?"

0:22:06.420,0:22:10.080
"No, I don't have a problem; I thank God!"

0:22:10.080,0:22:11.880
That is a man of faith for you.

0:22:11.880,0:22:14.420
We want to talk about this emotion.

0:22:14.420,0:22:17.960
You know when you say 'emotion', we mean feelings.

0:22:17.960,0:22:21.840
Emotion means feelings.

0:22:21.840,0:22:32.600
Sometimes people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.

0:22:32.600,0:22:35.640
They think they are in spirit.

0:22:35.640,0:22:37.640
They say, "Eh, I'm in the spirit!"

0:22:37.640,0:22:41.960
"Oh Lord Jesus, I can feel the spirit of God now!"

0:22:41.960,0:22:48.040
"I can hear! Father, thank You! Thank You for everything!"

0:22:48.040,0:22:50.340
"Ah, I feel the presence of God!"

0:22:50.340,0:22:54.360
Where?

0:22:54.360,0:22:57.440
Because they feel cold air.

0:22:57.440,0:23:03.800
"Hm, thank You, Lord!"

0:23:03.800,0:23:11.240
Some will say, "I want to come to Lagos to see Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:23:11.240,0:23:14.200
but now I don't have enough money.

0:23:14.200,0:23:19.500
Next week, if I get enough money, God wants me to come to Joshua".

0:23:19.500,0:23:22.560
Before next week, you have enough money. You say, "Yes, God wants me to go".

0:23:22.560,0:23:27.760
How do you know?

0:23:27.760,0:23:33.660
Everything must be examined in the light of God's Word.

0:23:33.660,0:23:37.540
All these are feelings.

0:23:37.540,0:23:39.540
Are what?

0:23:39.540,0:23:41.000
Feelings.

0:23:41.000,0:23:48.400
Whatever sign you receive must be examined in the light of God's Word

0:23:48.400,0:24:01.980
because faith is not a feeling.

0:24:01.980,0:24:39.500
Sometimes people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.

0:24:39.500,0:24:46.840
You say, "God, if you want me to go to church on Sunday, I don't have money.

0:24:46.840,0:24:49.520
I need to pay my tithe.

0:24:49.520,0:24:56.340
If you want me to go to church on next Sunday, please bless me.

0:24:56.340,0:25:00.100
Bless me".

0:25:00.100,0:25:06.560
But from now till Sunday you say, "God, over to you if you want me to go to church".

0:25:06.560,0:25:10.680
But you wake up in the morning and say, "Well, if you want me to go to church;

0:25:10.680,0:25:13.500
if you don't want me to go to church, over to you".

0:25:13.500,0:25:16.180
You should not give God conditions.

0:25:16.180,0:25:19.160
You are created for His own glory.

0:25:19.160,0:25:24.260
Whether good or bad, "Jesus is Lord".

0:25:24.260,0:25:35.200
Sometimes people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.

0:25:35.200,0:26:10.660
Problems arise when feelings and emotions change.

0:26:10.660,0:26:12.180
They just come.

0:26:12.180,0:26:17.300
"Brother, I have a message for you from the United Kingdom.

0:26:17.300,0:26:20.900
I just received a phone call".

0:26:20.900,0:26:22.620
"Tell me, tell me!"

0:26:22.620,0:26:23.980
I say, "No, I will tell you later".

0:26:23.980,0:26:25.860
Haa!

0:26:25.860,0:26:31.480
Whereas you have somebody at home that is seriously sick.

0:26:31.480,0:26:34.220
"Tell me - what is the message? From who?"

0:26:34.220,0:26:40.580
"Don't worry. I will tell you. Relax."

0:26:40.580,0:26:43.380
"What is the message? Brother, tell me!"

0:26:43.380,0:26:45.860
"No, no. I will tell you."

0:26:45.860,0:26:48.300
He keeps on saying, "Brother, please tell me the message!"

0:26:48.300,0:26:51.040
"No, no. I will tell you."

0:26:51.040,0:26:52.820
Until you go to bed.

0:26:52.820,0:26:55.020
You are about to sleep. You say, "Brother, tell me the message!"

0:26:55.020,0:26:57.140
"No, no. I will tell you at my free time. Don't worry.

0:26:57.140,0:27:01.380
The message is hmmmm."

0:27:01.380,0:27:03.560
"Oh, tell me the message."

0:27:03.560,0:27:12.760
Now you go to bed and start looking, "God, what is this message?"

0:27:12.760,0:27:17.680
"God!"

0:27:17.680,0:27:27.600
You are about to have a nightmare to confirm your message

0:27:27.600,0:27:31.940
because you are worried.

0:27:31.940,0:27:36.960
The realm of the mind is what? - Disturbed.

0:27:36.960,0:27:41.840
The realm of the mind is disturbed.

0:27:41.840,0:27:48.660
This is what I mean by: Problems arise when feelings and emotions change.

0:27:48.660,0:27:53.000
The brother's feelings have what? - Changed.

0:27:53.000,0:27:58.160
Because someone promised to tell you the news from somewhere.

0:27:58.160,0:28:01.640
Your emotions and feelings changed immediately.

0:28:01.640,0:28:06.540
You start thinking about what that message could be.

0:28:06.540,0:28:09.520
Faith is not a feeling.

0:28:09.520,0:28:11.200
Take note of that.

0:28:11.200,0:28:18.360
But Christians today, they don't know the difference between what? - Faith and feelings.

0:28:18.360,0:28:22.740
You just feel.

0:28:22.740,0:28:30.900
"Ah, my ear is noisy. That is the spirit of God.

0:28:30.900,0:28:37.660
Anytime I have that sign, something good is coming."

0:28:37.660,0:28:43.780
When you are moving around, your eye just starts blinking.

0:28:43.780,0:28:54.920
"Ey, I feel the presence of God."

0:28:54.920,0:28:57.080
Some will see when my stomach is making noise.

0:28:57.080,0:29:03.780
If you have not eaten, the stomach will be disturbing you.

0:29:03.780,0:29:06.300
Let me tell you about faith and feeling.

0:29:06.300,0:30:03.140
For faith to be consistent, it must be based on something with more stability than your feeling.

0:30:03.140,0:30:10.300
When you are controlled by feelings, you can never be consistent in your words.

0:30:10.300,0:30:18.760
You say, "T.B. Joshua is a man of God".

0:30:18.760,0:30:24.140
Another minute another person will come and say, "That man is not a man of God".

0:30:24.140,0:30:26.840
"Yes, he is not a man of God."

0:30:26.840,0:30:29.680
"He is a man of God." - "Yes, he is a man of God."

0:30:29.680,0:30:33.460
"This is red." - "Yes, this is red."

0:30:33.460,0:30:39.280
"You know it is not red, it is yellow." - Yes, it is yellow."

0:30:39.280,0:30:44.080
One can never be consistent in his doings.

0:30:44.080,0:30:49.280
You keep saying "A" today; another minute - "No".

0:30:49.280,0:30:55.740
Because you are like a paper in the face of storm.

0:30:55.740,0:31:04.820
Look at this. Can you see?

0:31:04.820,0:31:09.740
Do you see?

0:31:09.740,0:31:13.340
This is the kind of life one will continue to live.

0:31:13.340,0:31:18.600
When things are good, you say, "Jesus is Lord".

0:31:18.600,0:31:24.280
When things are tough, you say, "Jesus be cursed".

0:31:24.280,0:31:31.000
These are the people that are controlled by feelings and emotions.

0:31:31.000,0:31:41.040
For faith to be consistent, it must be based on something with more stability than your feeling.

0:31:41.040,0:31:43.260
What is the stability?

0:31:43.260,0:31:51.920
That is, feelings lack the quality of being stable.

0:31:51.920,0:31:55.560
Let's give a good example - a footballer.

0:31:55.560,0:31:59.300
What I believe in is training.

0:31:59.300,0:32:01.300
I need training.

0:32:01.300,0:32:06.220
I want to play tomorrow.

0:32:06.220,0:32:09.460
They say, "Brother, after your training you need to pray!"

0:32:09.460,0:32:15.400
"Pray? I need to work. please. My work is God."

0:32:15.400,0:32:18.100
We will get to the field.

0:32:18.100,0:32:19.860
Number 7.

0:32:19.860,0:32:27.620
WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua

0:32:27.620,0:32:30.940
What happened?

0:32:30.940,0:32:37.520
You are not saved because you feel you are saved.

0:32:37.520,0:32:45.260
Tell your neighbour: You are not saved because you feel you are saved.

0:32:45.260,0:33:03.480
You are saved because you put your faith on God's Word and acted on it.

0:33:03.480,0:33:06.000
That is feeling.

0:33:06.000,0:33:09.500
After training you have to rely on God.

0:33:09.500,0:33:14.400
Even while training, you say, "In the name of Jesus".

0:33:14.400,0:33:16.400
Continue to meditate the name Jesus.

0:33:16.400,0:33:19.360
"By Your power I am doing this."

0:33:19.360,0:33:23.960
"I am weak. Manifest Your strength in my weakness, Lord Jesus."

0:33:23.960,0:33:26.500
"For when I'm weak, I am strong."

0:33:26.500,0:33:45.040
You are not saved because you feel you are saved.

0:33:45.040,0:34:17.840
You are saved because you put your faith on God's Word and act on it.

0:34:17.840,0:34:22.000
When you say, "Hey, I have practised", "Hey, I am very intelligent",

0:34:22.000,0:34:24.640
"I am a student, I read my books very well",

0:34:24.640,0:34:26.200
"I'm going to make it".

0:34:26.200,0:34:32.640
Read and pray because man has the ability to work

0:34:32.640,0:34:37.940
but the Holy Spirit works as He wills.

0:34:37.940,0:34:51.280
Man has the power to work.

0:34:51.280,0:35:07.440
The Holy Spirit works as He wills.

0:35:07.440,0:35:12.720
It means that He can use any medium.

0:35:12.720,0:35:15.380
Take note of that.

0:35:15.380,0:35:44.600
It means that He can use any medium to express Himself.

0:35:44.600,0:35:53.680
'As He wills' means He can use any medium to express Himself.

0:35:53.680,0:35:56.460
It could be medium of stone.

0:35:56.460,0:35:59.800
He can use a stone to do His work.

0:35:59.800,0:36:06.020
He can use the medium of attire, hem of garment.

0:36:06.020,0:36:12.180
Remember the woman with the issue of blood touched the garment.

0:36:12.180,0:36:27.120
He can decide to use the medium of sound or voice of servant.

0:36:27.120,0:36:29.220
Remember what happened at the Pentecost.

0:36:29.220,0:36:37.280
It was the sound, and the Holy Spirit came upon them

0:36:37.280,0:36:40.340
and they began to speak in tongues.

0:36:40.340,0:36:43.760
Remember what happened in Acts 3.

0:36:43.760,0:36:52.460
Peter and John said to the crippled man, "Silver or gold we have not".

0:36:52.460,0:36:58.140
That is voice to express Himself.

0:36:58.140,0:37:02.620
Look at what happened in Acts 16 about Paul and Silas.

0:37:02.620,0:37:05.880
It was just sound.

0:37:05.880,0:37:09.440
They started praising God and the miracle happened.

0:37:09.440,0:37:13.840
They never said, "In the name of Jesus, I rebuke!"

0:37:13.840,0:37:19.140
No! While they were chained - hands and legs --

0:37:19.140,0:37:21.900
I know, if you were in their position, you would say,

0:37:21.900,0:37:26.580
"Look, Jesus, if you don't loose me, I won't serve You again!

0:37:26.580,0:37:31.300
Loose me now because I'm innocent".

0:37:31.300,0:37:34.000
But they never said anything like that.

0:37:34.000,0:37:36.520
While they were chained, they were praising God.

0:37:36.520,0:37:43.920
Praising the Lord always

0:37:43.920,0:37:51.060
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:37:51.060,0:38:02.100
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:38:02.100,0:38:03.760
Listen to that.

0:38:03.760,0:38:08.360
They were saying, "The Lord is good", although they were chained.

0:38:08.360,0:38:14.820
Tell your neighbour: Even though I am chained, the Lord is good.

0:38:14.820,0:38:20.040
Whether I'm chained or not, the Lord is good.

0:38:20.040,0:38:24.700
Whether I am free or not, the Lord is good.

0:38:24.700,0:38:32.500
Whether I'm okay or not, the Lord is good all the time.

0:38:32.500,0:38:35.640
Remember what happened to Joshua.

0:38:35.640,0:38:41.380
It was a matter of marching round the city,

0:38:41.380,0:38:45.460
and the limitation was broken.

0:38:45.460,0:38:47.540
Are you talking of David?

0:38:47.540,0:38:57.000
It was a matter of catapult.

0:38:57.020,0:39:07.900
He just picked the stone and put it.

0:39:07.900,0:39:22.280
Now, if we are able to define faith, what is feeling then, which is opposite to that.

0:39:22.280,0:40:03.120
Feelings and emotions are influenced by what we see, what we read and what we hear.

0:40:03.120,0:40:20.740
Remember the book of Psalm 12, which says, "Everyone lies to his neighbour".

0:40:20.740,0:40:31.140
This means, everyone is exposed to things that are not consistent with God's Word.

0:40:31.140,0:40:52.020
Everyone is exposed to things that are not consistent with God's Word.

0:40:52.020,0:40:56.520
What are the things that are not consistent with God's Word?

0:40:56.520,0:41:03.220
You want to see breaking news on the pages of a newspaper before you can read the paper.

0:41:03.220,0:41:13.800
Before you tune in to a station, you want to hear, "Oh, there is calamity somewhere! War!"

0:41:13.800,0:41:22.420
If we allow our feelings to control our faith,

0:41:22.420,0:41:34.700
we can be a Christian, yet controlled by satan's devices.

0:41:34.700,0:42:31.740
If our feelings control our faith, we can be a Christian, yet controlled by satan's devices.

0:42:31.740,0:42:34.980
Not that you will not be a Christian.

0:42:34.980,0:42:39.180
What people say, what you read, what you hear,

0:42:39.180,0:42:49.040
what your circumstances look like - this is what controls you.

0:42:49.040,0:42:53.800
One thing you must know.

0:42:53.800,0:43:05.140
You may feel great today, tired tomorrow, lonely next week.

0:43:05.140,0:43:06.900
Hallelujah!

0:43:06.900,0:43:17.180
God's Word is going to say the same thing yesterday, today and forever

0:43:17.180,0:43:26.120
because He is unchangeable.

0:43:26.120,0:43:57.600
You may feel great today, tired tomorrow, lonely next week.

0:43:57.600,0:44:00.940
Hallelujah!

0:44:00.940,0:44:08.240
God's Word is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:44:08.240,0:44:15.760
Forever O Lord

0:44:15.760,0:44:19.820
Your Word is settled

0:44:19.820,0:44:24.620
In Heaven it is settled

0:44:24.620,0:44:28.540
Forever O Lord

0:44:28.540,0:44:34.180
When you look at the book of Hebrews 13:8,

0:44:34.180,0:44:45.500
"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever".

0:44:45.500,0:44:48.040
Hallelujah!

0:44:48.040,0:44:51.560
This is why you must be forever grateful.

0:44:51.560,0:44:54.400
Help me sing this song:

0:44:54.400,0:45:04.480
I'm forever grateful to You

0:45:04.480,0:45:16.080
I'm forever grateful for the cross

0:45:16.080,0:45:28.240
I'm forever grateful to You

0:45:28.240,0:45:41.860
That You came to seek and save the lost

0:45:41.860,0:45:54.320
I'm forever grateful to You

0:45:54.320,0:46:05.840
I'm forever grateful for the cross

0:46:05.840,0:46:18.300
I'm forever grateful to You

0:46:18.300,0:46:33.220
That You came to seek and save the lost

0:46:33.220,0:46:35.340
Have your seat.

0:46:35.340,0:46:40.000
You must forever be grateful.

0:46:40.000,0:46:45.300
No matter what comes, no matter what happens.

0:46:45.300,0:46:50.860
When the goings are good, Jesus is Lord.

0:46:50.860,0:46:59.700
When the goings are tough, you must forever be grateful.

0:46:59.700,0:47:03.740
I think you have learned so much about feelings.

0:47:03.740,0:47:13.600
Feelings are influenced by what we see, what we read,

0:47:13.600,0:47:18.600
and what people tell us.

0:47:18.600,0:47:28.220
When those things control you as a Christian, you can never be consistent in your doings.

0:47:28.220,0:47:32.200
Your moment will look like cat and rabbit.

0:47:32.200,0:47:37.820
When a cat is chasing a rabbit, the rabbit will go this way.

0:47:37.820,0:47:43.220
When the rabbit sees that the cat is too much, it will go this way.

0:47:43.220,0:47:47.660
This is the way of cat and rat.

0:47:47.660,0:47:50.980
Left - right, left - right.

0:47:50.980,0:48:08.020
WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua

0:48:08.020,0:48:10.020
Ok. Look here.

0:48:10.020,0:48:17.000
Here - faith.

0:48:17.000,0:48:29.440
All what we are saying here is all about within and without.

0:48:29.440,0:48:41.360
Many Christians today can fight but filled within with fear.

0:48:41.360,0:48:45.220
I'm having headache: "Jesus, heal me!"

0:48:45.220,0:48:48.680
When they realise the more they call the name Jesus, the more the headache,

0:48:48.680,0:48:53.160
and the headache is serious - "In Jesus' name" -

0:48:53.160,0:49:05.780
"I need to go and see my doctor

0:49:05.780,0:49:12.980
because I think God wants me to see my doctor!

0:49:12.980,0:49:18.200
That is why the more I call His name, the more the headache!

0:49:18.200,0:49:22.460
He wants me to go and see my doctor!

0:49:22.460,0:49:26.580
If not, He will answer my prayer!"

0:49:26.580,0:49:41.760
You see, many Christians today, when trouble is far, they are good in calling the name Jesus.

0:49:41.760,0:49:46.160
Like you learn that there is a war somewhere - far.

0:49:46.160,0:49:49.760
You read it on the pages of a newspaper; you saw it on a channel.

0:49:49.760,0:49:53.300
There is a war somewhere - far.

0:49:53.300,0:49:56.340
Now, you want to pray to stop the war.

0:49:56.340,0:50:01.880
"Hey, Jesus Christ, that war there should stop there, should just stop!"

0:50:01.880,0:50:10.080
By the time you open your eyes, you find that the war is just at your door.

0:50:10.080,0:50:17.800
The trouble you are trying to stop far away is now very close to your door.

0:50:17.800,0:50:20.280
This time, you will not close your eyes.

0:50:20.280,0:50:28.000
You say, "Ah! What do You want me to do?"

0:50:28.000,0:50:35.020
When faith fills our soul, it fills our soul with a strong desire

0:50:35.020,0:50:37.920
for the things we pray for.

0:50:37.920,0:50:45.620
It fills our soul with a strong desire to pray the more, even in the face of trial,

0:50:45.620,0:50:49.980
to pray the more even in the face of temptation,

0:50:49.980,0:51:00.580
to pray the more even in the face of threats to life.

0:51:00.580,0:51:06.680
Let me take you to the book of Daniel.

0:51:06.680,0:51:15.500
In Daniel 6: 10, "Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published,

0:51:15.500,0:51:23.360
he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem".

0:51:23.360,0:51:35.100
While the decree was published, Daniel still had that boldness to go to the upper room.

0:51:35.100,0:51:38.300
Faith fills our soul with a strong desire.

0:51:38.300,0:51:42.740
Tell your neighbour: Faith fills our soul with a strong desire.

0:51:42.740,0:51:48.020
It fills our soul with a strong desire for the things we pray for -

0:51:48.020,0:51:54.560
desire to pray the more even in the face of trouble,

0:51:54.560,0:52:03.200
to pray the more even in the face of threats to life.

0:52:03.200,0:52:08.600
Like I was telling you:

0:52:08.600,0:52:15.020
If faith affects the realm of the mind, this means

0:52:15.020,0:52:25.000
whatever we see should be examined in the light of God's Word.

0:52:25.000,0:52:30.180
Whatever we hear should be examined in the light of God's Word.

0:52:30.180,0:52:35.160
Whatever we read should be examined in the light of God's Word.

0:52:35.160,0:52:43.320
When something happens to you, whether positive or negative,

0:52:43.320,0:52:54.700
as a man of faith, it will be too soon to jubilate or despair

0:52:54.700,0:52:59.380
without finding out what God says about it.

0:52:59.380,0:53:09.700
Because faith is not only emotional but also affects the realm of the mind.

0:53:09.700,0:53:18.620
Tell your neighbour: When something happens to you, whether positive or negative,

0:53:18.620,0:53:24.340
it will be too soon to jubilate, if it is positive;

0:53:24.340,0:53:31.200
it will be too soon to despair, if it is negative,

0:53:31.200,0:53:36.120
without finding out what God says about it.

0:53:36.120,0:53:44.180
If it is positive, it will be too soon to say, "Ahh, this is money!"

0:53:44.180,0:53:51.180
because when joy is not handled carefully,  it will soon turn to sadness.

0:53:51.180,0:53:58.120
Tell your neighbour: When joy is not handled carefully,  it will soon turn to sadness.

0:53:58.120,0:54:07.820
When sadness is handled carefully, it will soon turn to joy.

0:54:07.820,0:54:16.360
How you handle your situation matters as a man of faith.

0:54:16.360,0:54:24.280
God sometimes uses foolish things to confound the wise.

0:54:24.280,0:54:28.560
To the wise, poverty is a foolish thing.

0:54:28.560,0:54:32.340
To the wise, sickness is a foolish thing.

0:54:32.340,0:54:35.880
To the wise, barrenness is a foolish thing.

0:54:35.880,0:54:39.320
To the wise, nightmare is a foolish thing.

0:54:39.320,0:54:47.200
To the wise, setback is a foolish thing.

0:54:47.200,0:54:57.360
Remember, it was disappointment that preserved Peter.

0:54:57.360,0:55:00.720
Our God is an awesome God

0:55:00.720,0:55:03.460
He reigns

0:55:03.460,0:55:11.440
From Heaven above with wisdom, power and love

0:55:11.440,0:55:22.840
Our God is an awesome God

0:55:22.840,0:55:25.700
He reigns

0:55:25.700,0:55:34.620
From Heaven above with wisdom, power and love

0:55:34.620,0:55:47.060
Our God is an awesome God

0:55:47.060,0:55:50.320
He reigns

0:55:50.320,0:56:00.060
From Heaven above with wisdom, power and love

0:56:00.060,0:56:05.600
Our God is an awesome God

0:56:05.600,0:56:08.100
Amen!

0:56:08.100,0:56:10.400
Yes.

0:56:10.400,0:56:21.420
If you must have faith, you must learn to hear God's Word.

0:56:21.420,0:56:56.860
It is important for you to not only hear it with your ears, but also with your heart.

0:56:56.860,0:57:02.320
With your what? - Heart.

0:57:02.320,0:57:38.940
To hear God's Word in our heart requires openness and hunger for God's Word.

0:57:38.940,0:57:46.540
When you are hungry for God's Word - it means your life depends on knowing it.

0:57:46.540,0:57:52.720
If your life does not depend on knowing God's Word, you cannot be hungry for it.

0:57:52.720,0:57:54.960
You cannot.

0:57:54.960,0:58:11.660
And your life can only depend on knowing it when you have love for it, time for it.

0:58:11.660,0:58:19.540
When you learn to hear God's Word, you have affection for it.

0:58:19.540,0:58:24.260
Through hearing, belief comes.

0:58:24.260,0:58:30.720
Through believing, trust comes.

0:58:30.720,0:58:34.500
Through trusting, confidence is established.

0:58:34.500,0:58:39.820
Now, in conclusion.

0:58:39.820,0:58:42.140
Yes.

0:58:42.140,0:58:57.220
This process is not automatic - the process of hearing and obeying.

0:58:57.220,0:59:02.420
I said, through hearing, belief comes.

0:59:02.420,0:59:07.060
Through believing, trust comes.

0:59:07.060,0:59:12.280
Through trusting, confidence is established.

0:59:12.280,0:59:20.660
This process is not automatic but gradual.

0:59:20.660,0:59:43.300
However, this process is not automatic but gradual.

0:59:43.300,0:59:45.020
What do I mean?

0:59:45.020,1:00:00.940
I mean, those who refuse to take these tiny steps cannot believe God.

1:00:00.940,1:00:03.720
Take note of that.

1:00:03.720,1:00:38.400
Those who refuse to take these tiny steps cannot believe God.

1:00:38.400,1:01:17.380
Because they cannot understand the basic truth about faith.

1:01:17.380,1:01:20.220
Look at what happened to the boy's father.

1:01:20.220,1:01:36.520
Among the crowd, the boy's father put to shame the faithless generation with his belief and prayer.

1:01:36.520,1:01:39.980
These two things.

1:01:39.980,1:01:42.460
It was not automatic.

1:01:42.460,1:01:46.140
"I believe, help my unbelief!"

1:01:46.140,1:01:51.280
That is not automatic. If it were automatic, "I believe" and you would just receive.

1:01:51.280,1:02:05.600
He said, "I believe". At the same time he withdrew, "Ah, help my unbelief".

1:02:05.600,1:02:07.760
Let's take you there.

1:02:07.760,1:02:12.320
Mark 9:24, "Immediately the boy's father shouted,

1:02:12.320,1:02:16.520
"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"

1:02:16.520,1:02:20.540
Now, there are two statements there.

1:02:20.540,1:02:58.240
With his belief and prayer saying, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"

1:02:58.240,1:03:07.680
He put to shame the faithless generation with his belief.

1:03:07.680,1:03:13.680
Remember, with his belief; that is, traditional belief.

1:03:13.680,1:03:18.420
Because he said, "I believe" and later he said, "Help me overcome my unbelief!".

1:03:18.420,1:03:26.760
It means, that belief he claimed at the beginning was unable to receive from Jesus

1:03:26.760,1:03:32.100
because believing is the condition to receive.

1:03:32.100,1:03:39.600
Now, we say with his belief and prayer.

1:03:39.600,1:04:30.620
This statement is both an expression of his belief in our Lord Jesus Christ and prayer for help.

1:04:30.620,1:04:37.960
It was that faith that found expression in the spoken word.

1:04:37.960,1:04:44.880
Let me take you to Genesis 1:3,

1:04:44.880,1:04:50.280
"God said, 'Let there be light', and there was light".

1:04:50.280,1:04:53.820
Wow.

1:04:53.820,1:05:31.340
That command was an expression of God's faith in Himself.

1:05:31.340,1:05:35.680
Back to Mark 11.

1:05:35.680,1:05:39.720
If I may read verse 23.

1:05:39.720,1:05:49.060
"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, through yourself into the sea' --"

1:05:49.060,1:05:53.960
Be thou removed!

1:05:53.960,1:05:58.640
It was God's faith in Himself.

1:05:58.640,1:06:02.780
Be thou removed!

1:06:02.780,1:06:07.060
That is God in action.

1:06:07.060,1:06:15.160
When the believer says, "In the name of Jesus, be thou removed!",

1:06:15.160,1:06:32.540
it is an expression of the believer's faith in God.

1:06:32.540,1:06:38.940
Let me take you to the book of Acts 3.

1:06:38.940,1:06:44.920
"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"

1:06:44.920,1:06:46.480
That is all!

1:06:46.480,1:06:48.480
That is the part I need.

1:06:48.480,1:06:51.160
"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"

1:06:51.160,1:06:54.200
What does that mean?

1:06:54.200,1:06:57.520
That is attention!

1:06:57.520,1:07:03.360
I mean, genuine willingness.

1:07:03.360,1:07:14.100
Look at, "Pay attention to God's Word because God is in His Word".

1:07:14.100,1:07:17.740
"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"

1:07:17.740,1:07:21.640
It means, "Attention, please!"

1:07:21.640,1:07:26.720
If you must have faith - I'm telling you how to have faith - you must pay attention.

1:07:26.720,1:07:30.780
I mean, genuine willingness.

1:07:30.780,1:07:35.180
Genuine willingness means you must forget yourself.

1:07:35.180,1:07:38.140
How do we forget ourselves?

1:07:38.140,1:07:40.300
We forget ourselves when we leave it for God.

1:07:40.300,1:07:46.160
Tell your neighbour: Leave it for God!

1:07:46.160,1:07:47.920
We pay attention when we leave it for God.

1:07:47.920,1:07:50.240
Say, leave it for God!

1:07:50.240,1:07:53.000
Leave your trouble for God,

1:07:53.000,1:07:55.500
your worry for God!

1:07:55.500,1:07:59.120
Leave it for God!

1:07:59.120,1:08:00.800
God is aware.

1:08:00.800,1:08:03.260
He is aware of your injustice.

1:08:03.260,1:08:05.920
He will not leave you without justice.

1:08:05.920,1:08:08.500
He is aware of your sickness.

1:08:08.500,1:08:10.900
He will not leave you without healing.

1:08:10.900,1:08:13.000
He is aware of your yoke.

1:08:13.000,1:08:15.280
He will not leave you without freedom.

1:08:15.280,1:08:17.380
He is aware of your failure.

1:08:17.380,1:08:19.540
He will not leave you without success.

1:08:19.540,1:08:22.640
He is aware! Say, He is aware!

1:08:22.640,1:08:25.220
Leave it for God!

1:08:25.220,1:08:27.560
Leave it for God

1:08:27.560,1:08:30.340
Don't worry yourself

1:08:30.340,1:08:33.640
Leave it for God

1:08:33.640,1:08:37.120
Don't cry no more

1:08:37.120,1:08:41.060
Jesus is alive

1:08:41.060,1:08:44.060
Praise God!

1:08:44.060,1:08:48.040
You can face tomorrow

1:08:48.040,1:08:51.200
He understands

1:08:51.200,1:08:55.100
What you are passing through today

1:08:55.100,1:08:59.680
Let God glorify His name

1:08:59.680,1:09:01.680
Don't worry; leave it for God.

1:09:01.680,1:09:04.620
Your failure - leave it for God. Your poverty - leave it for God.

1:09:04.620,1:09:08.180
Your nightmare - leave it for God. Your trouble - leave it for God.

1:09:08.180,1:09:09.960
Your panic - leave it for God.

1:09:09.960,1:09:13.040
Leave it for God!

1:09:13.040,1:09:20.580
This is the only way you can have faith - leave it for God and stay focused!

1:09:20.580,1:09:24.740
You cannot show genuine willingness if you don't leave it for God.

1:09:24.740,1:09:27.400
It is either you are yes or no.

1:09:27.400,1:09:30.520
You cannot be yes and no.

1:09:30.520,1:09:34.140
It is either you are righteous or unrighteous.

1:09:34.140,1:09:38.000
There is no neutral kingdom.

1:09:38.000,1:09:40.940
God is able

1:09:40.940,1:09:46.300
Abundantly able

1:09:46.300,1:09:55.900
To deliver and to save

1:09:55.900,1:10:01.740
God is able

1:10:01.740,1:10:08.060
Abundantly able

1:10:08.060,1:10:16.480
To deliver those who trust in Him

1:10:16.480,1:10:19.380
Underline the word 'trust'.

1:10:19.380,1:10:23.200
If you trust Him, you leave your worry for Him.

1:10:23.200,1:10:26.220
If you trust God, you leave your failure for Him.

1:10:26.220,1:10:29.340
If you trust Him, you leave your panic for Him.

1:10:29.340,1:10:34.500
If you trust Him, you leave your barrenness, your nightmare for Him.

1:10:34.500,1:10:39.440
I have confidence in His ability to heal, to bless, to save.

1:10:39.440,1:10:43.540
If you believe Him, you must have confidence in His ability.

1:10:43.540,1:10:47.420
"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"

1:10:47.420,1:10:49.200
You know what Peter was saying?

1:10:49.200,1:10:57.020
He was saying, he should leave his worry for God and look at him.

1:10:57.020,1:11:07.280
To know Jesus is not only to see His works but to learn His way.

1:11:07.280,1:11:17.860
To know Jesus is not only to see His miracles but also to learn His way.

1:11:17.860,1:11:58.320
To know Jesus Christ is not only to see His works but also to learn His way.

1:11:58.320,1:12:18.200
Thank you very much, in Jesus' name!

1:12:18.200,1:12:38.160
WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua

1:12:38.160,1:12:41.220
Amen!

1:12:41.220,1:12:46.780
Thank you very much!

1:12:46.780,1:12:52.260
Rise up. Let me just give you a word of prayer.

1:12:52.260,1:13:07.520
Jesus must be honoured

1:13:07.520,1:13:14.440
In my life every day

1:13:14.440,1:13:31.720
Jesus must be honoured

1:13:31.720,1:13:39.000
In my life every day

1:13:39.000,1:13:56.140
Jesus must be honoured

1:13:56.140,1:14:03.420
In my life every day

1:14:03.420,1:14:06.120
Right now, bow down your head.

1:14:06.120,1:14:11.180
Ask Jesus to give you a hearing heart.

1:14:11.180,1:14:19.680
I've got my mind made up

1:14:19.680,1:14:23.820
And I won't turn back

1:14:23.820,1:14:32.420
Because I want to see my Jesus some day

1:14:32.420,1:14:37.280
I've got my mind made up

1:14:37.280,1:14:41.580
And I won't turn back

1:14:41.580,1:14:49.960
Because I want to see my Jesus some day

1:14:49.960,1:14:52.740
Father, we thank You.

1:14:52.740,1:15:02.680
Give thanks to Him for giving you an obedient heart, faithful heart.

1:15:02.680,1:15:06.120
Give thanks to Him. Father, we thank You.

1:15:06.120,1:15:08.720
Holy Spirit, we thank You.

1:15:08.720,1:15:12.420
Accept our thanks, in Jesus' name.

1:15:12.420,1:15:13.800
Thank You, Lord.

1:15:13.800,1:15:19.680
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
