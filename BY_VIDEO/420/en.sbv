During the Sunday live service, at the Synagogue Church of All Nations,

0:00:04.180,0:00:08.600
Prophet T.B. Joshua led by the Spirit of God, moves in the midst of the people

0:00:08.600,0:00:12.780
prophesying to them, revealing the root cause of their problems.

0:00:12.780,0:00:15.300
Let's listen as he speaks to this woman.

0:00:15.300,0:00:16.060
How are you?

0:00:16.060,0:00:18.400
Fine, sir.

0:00:18.400,0:00:21.220
There is a controversy over a child.

0:00:21.220,0:00:23.300
Yes, sir.

0:00:23.320,0:00:25.900
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:25.960,0:00:31.640
After Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to the woman that there was a controversy over a child,

0:00:31.640,0:00:37.780
the man of God invited her husband to come to The SCOAN the following Sunday.

0:00:37.780,0:00:43.200
Let's watch as God Almighty opens the case file of this family.

0:00:43.220,0:00:44.660
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:44.660,0:00:49.180
My name is Rosemary Isibor Busari. I am from Edo State.

0:00:49.180,0:00:54.760
Last week Sunday, during the first service, the man of God came to me and prophesied to me.

0:00:54.760,0:01:00.140
He said there was a controversy over a child and the prophecy is true.

0:01:00.140,0:01:06.060
My children are there: the first one, the second one, I lost the third one.

0:01:06.060,0:01:10.280
The first one is the one the man of God was talking about.

0:01:10.280,0:01:15.540
I discovered that the father would beat him all the time.

0:01:15.540,0:01:16.940
Even when the child made very little mistakes -

0:01:16.940,0:01:19.820
where one should just say: "Don't do that again"

0:01:19.820,0:01:21.220
and let the child correct himself.

0:01:21.220,0:01:25.980
But he would beat him, as if he was a goat and he wanted to kill him.

0:01:25.980,0:01:29.580
I didn't like what was happening so I told my husband

0:01:29.580,0:01:32.780
that the way this was going was not really good

0:01:32.780,0:01:38.540
and that he should rather just correct the child and that would settle it.

0:01:38.540,0:01:42.620
He got angry with me and said that he was not the father of the child.

0:01:42.620,0:01:47.160
He told me that because I said the way he was beating the child was not right,

0:01:47.160,0:01:48.720
that I should take the child to the father.

0:01:48.720,0:01:54.060
They even called a family meeting, asking me who the father was.

0:01:54.060,0:01:57.460
I said that he was the father, that there was no other man to call father.

0:01:57.460,0:01:58.780
He is the father.

0:01:58.780,0:02:00.540
I am married to him. He is the father.

0:02:00.540,0:02:03.800
I said that I didn't come to his house with any child.

0:02:03.800,0:02:07.340
There was another instance, when the child went to

0:02:07.340,0:02:09.060
take his Common Entrance Examination.

0:02:09.060,0:02:12.680
The time the child told him to collect him was different

0:02:12.680,0:02:16.660
from the time they finished. So the child was the only one left and

0:02:16.660,0:02:20.060
the school decided to take him back to their own school,

0:02:20.060,0:02:22.380
as the exam took place in another school.

0:02:22.380,0:02:26.260
When the father got to the other school and couldn't find him,

0:02:26.260,0:02:28.840
he went to his own school and found him there.

0:02:28.840,0:02:31.940
He then brought him out of the class and took him far away,

0:02:31.940,0:02:35.020
where no one would see him and started beating him.

0:02:35.020,0:02:38.600
It was so severe that it was only through the intervention of some parents

0:02:38.600,0:02:40.160
that came to pick up their own children

0:02:40.160,0:02:44.700
and the security officer of the school that the child was rescued.

0:02:44.700,0:02:48.980
He was insisting that they should leave him, that he wanted to kill the child

0:02:48.980,0:02:52.020
or let the child kill him.

0:02:52.020,0:02:56.260
He has sent me out of the house because I told him that the drugs

0:02:56.260,0:03:01.020
he bought for the fourth child - he was reacting negatively to them

0:03:01.020,0:03:02.600
and that he should stop taking the drugs.

0:03:02.600,0:03:05.400
That was why he sent me out of the house.

0:03:05.400,0:03:10.680
The third child that died - he also bought the drugs I gave to the child.

0:03:10.680,0:03:12.900
The next morning, the child died.

0:03:12.900,0:03:14.560
So, the question now!

0:03:14.560,0:03:16.900
He said he is not the father of the child?

0:03:16.900,0:03:17.800
Yes, sir.

0:03:17.800,0:03:23.200
I am Yahaya Busari.

0:03:23.240,0:03:27.820
This is my first time of coming to church. I am a Muslim.

0:03:27.820,0:03:29.300
This is my ex-wife.

0:03:29.300,0:03:35.040
I first of all want to thank you for the honour you have given to me and to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:03:35.040,0:03:39.700
So before you talk - thank you very much.

0:03:39.780,0:03:45.320
Thank you. Because every man has discretion.

0:03:45.320,0:03:48.760
As a Muslim, Alhaji, with your position,

0:03:48.760,0:03:54.680
you heard that T.B. Joshua said this and you did not mind.

0:03:54.680,0:03:57.860
This is the first time you enter into a church in your life.

0:03:57.860,0:04:01.320
You said: "That T.B. Joshua - I will enter his church today."

0:04:01.320,0:04:05.300
I want to say thank you very much for the honour.

0:04:05.300,0:04:09.560
He who honours a prophet will receive a prophet's reward.

0:04:09.560,0:04:10.460
Amen.

0:04:10.460,0:04:14.740
Before you talk, I want to appreciate this. Thank you very much.

0:04:14.740,0:04:18.380
The bottom line of this matter is that these are my children

0:04:18.380,0:04:26.220
but whenever I want to correct my children, my wife will slap me.

0:04:26.220,0:04:29.340
They all see me as a stranger in my house.

0:04:29.340,0:04:33.200
If I enter my house, I will feel like a stranger. They no longer love me.

0:04:33.200,0:04:36.380
She turned the attention of our children only to herself.

0:04:36.380,0:04:39.500
About one month ago, I went out in the evening.

0:04:39.500,0:04:42.500
She called me that my son was ill.

0:04:42.500,0:04:44.620
I panicked and came home immediately.

0:04:44.620,0:04:52.640
I took both of them, Ramani and Maliki, straight to the pharmacy.

0:04:52.640,0:04:57.880
They gave them drugs. I didn't know that one of the drugs was garlic.

0:04:57.880,0:05:02.280
When you chew garlic, it will be smelling and having an offensive odour.

0:05:02.280,0:05:05.520
I gave the drugs to the children.

0:05:05.520,0:05:07.580
My wife then called me in the presence of the children

0:05:07.580,0:05:09.620
and asked me why I gave them these drugs -

0:05:09.620,0:05:12.980
whether I wanted to kill them.

0:05:12.980,0:05:15.840
She said I was a ritualist who wanted to kill her children.

0:05:15.840,0:05:18.160
She slaps me all the time in the presence of my children.

0:05:18.160,0:05:27.600
In short, I told her that since I am now a stranger in my house and a ritualist,

0:05:27.600,0:05:30.760
she should go and look for the father of the children.

0:05:30.760,0:05:35.140
That was why I told her that I am no longer their father.

0:05:35.140,0:05:41.920
This is a lesson to all of us. If I am standing here condemning flesh and blood,

0:05:41.920,0:05:45.680
condemning my neighbour, fighting people by name,

0:05:45.680,0:05:53.480
if I would say: "Alhaji - these people are not good, this pastor is not good", Alaji would not come here today.

0:05:53.480,0:05:59.960
This is an opportunity for me to tell him about my God and he will tell me about his own God.

0:05:59.960,0:06:04.900
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:04.980,0:06:14.020
Alaji, are these children living with you? How about that baby?

0:06:14.020,0:06:16.540
I have been taking care of them by myself since that time.

0:06:16.540,0:06:17.360
This baby?

0:06:17.360,0:06:19.240
Yes. I bathe him. I don't go anywhere.

0:06:19.240,0:06:21.360
Please, Man of God, you can ask them.

0:06:21.360,0:06:23.660
For the past three weeks, I bathe them.

0:06:23.660,0:06:28.080
I bathe this small boy two times a day - in the morning and evening.

0:06:28.080,0:06:31.660
I feed them and cook for them by myself since she left my house.

0:06:31.660,0:06:34.580
They are my children - all of them.

0:06:34.580,0:06:37.400
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:37.460,0:06:43.100
She says you are beating this child to the extent of saying he is no longer your child!

0:06:43.100,0:06:49.700
If this man really means that this child is not his own, why should he take them?

0:06:49.700,0:06:53.700
Why should he not allow you to take the one that is not his own?

0:06:53.700,0:06:58.420
But he took all of them and is living with all of them.

0:06:58.420,0:07:08.040
There are two issues now. The issue could be because of faith - that is, she is a Christian; he is a Muslim.

0:07:08.040,0:07:12.840
Maybe at the beginning... I am telling you vision, what is happening in the house.

0:07:12.840,0:07:17.320
They do not want to mention that but I am telling you some secret things that happened.

0:07:17.320,0:07:22.300
When they first married, the man is a Muslim, and she married him.

0:07:22.300,0:07:25.300
They were together and had many children.

0:07:25.300,0:07:30.780
But later she now began to say that she did not want to be a Muslim but a Christian.

0:07:30.780,0:07:35.480
That would begin to cause what? If the husband says "no"!!

0:07:35.480,0:07:36.780
Exactly. She always says so.

0:07:36.780,0:07:39.020
Clap for Jesus Christ! Rise up!

0:07:39.020,0:07:43.900
Rise up! Rise up!

0:07:43.920,0:07:46.440
They would not mention that.

0:07:46.440,0:07:51.740
There are many issues between husband and wife that they would not mention.

0:07:51.740,0:07:53.860
But as a pastor, I know.

0:07:53.860,0:07:59.920
Your first time entering the church as Alaji and you have never done so.

0:07:59.920,0:08:03.760
And you honour that invitation because of these children.

0:08:03.760,0:08:08.680
And you people are here and not even telling us the real reason, why you are fighting.

0:08:08.680,0:08:11.220
But not until I said that this is the cause.

0:08:11.220,0:08:13.580
And you are now saying: "Yes, this is the cause."

0:08:13.580,0:08:17.200
Man of God, when they called me and said that I should come,

0:08:17.200,0:08:20.520
I said I must go straight away, since it was T.B. Joshua that invited me.

0:08:20.520,0:08:23.760
Because I watch your programme every day in my house. You can ask her.

0:08:23.760,0:08:25.960
Both day and night.

0:08:25.960,0:08:27.140
You can ask her.

0:08:27.140,0:08:28.340
You can ask her, Man of God.

0:08:28.340,0:08:30.240
You can ask any of my children.

0:08:30.240,0:08:32.160
He watches Emmanuel TV every day - even in the night.

0:08:32.160,0:08:35.340
When I would be sleeping and have to go to the bathroom, I would see him.

0:08:35.340,0:08:39.920
He would be glued to the television every night, watching Emmanuel TV.

0:08:39.920,0:08:42.980
My father watches Emmanuel TV every day.

0:08:42.980,0:08:48.600
That's how we were able to come here and solve this problem.

0:08:48.640,0:08:51.000
It is true.

0:08:51.000,0:08:54.740
I said: "As far as it is T.B. Joshua, I will be there immediately". I moved.

0:08:54.740,0:08:55.720
Thank you.

Please, Man of God, my wife said that I killed her father and my own son.

0:09:03.960,0:09:05.660
She said that I am a ritualist.

0:09:05.660,0:09:09.460
That is one of the reasons, why I am here so that you can touch me

0:09:09.460,0:09:14.500
and let me confess, how I killed her father and my own son.

0:09:14.500,0:09:16.100
Ok.

0:09:16.100,0:09:17.540
No, wait.

0:09:17.540,0:09:20.020
Next week, we will continue this.

0:09:20.020,0:09:25.600
But I want to assure you that the wisdom of Solomon is still there.

STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:09:34.900,0:09:41.020
The following Sunday, God continued to use Prophet T.B. Joshua to demonstrate the wisdom of Solomon

0:09:41.020,0:09:43.020
in the life of this couple.

0:09:43.020,0:09:45.900
What is God's opinion concerning this family?

0:09:45.960,0:09:48.420
Will reconciliation be possible?

0:09:48.420,0:09:51.500
Let's watch what happened next.

0:09:51.500,0:09:54.120
Let's take a look at the book of Romans 13.

0:09:54.120,0:09:58.200
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:58.280,0:10:02.300
Let me take a reading from the verse 1.

0:10:02.300,0:10:07.640
"Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities.

0:10:07.640,0:10:11.540
For there is no authority except from God,

0:10:11.540,0:10:17.260
and the authorities that exist are appointed by God."

0:10:17.260,0:10:18.520
Verse 2.

0:10:18.520,0:10:26.420
"Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God,

0:10:26.420,0:10:32.680
and those who resist will bring judgement on themselves."

0:10:32.680,0:10:33.700
Verse 3.

0:10:33.700,0:10:41.460
"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."

0:10:41.460,0:10:44.800
Let's read it together and take note of that. Write it on your paper.

0:10:44.800,0:10:47.100
That is the area we want to talk about.

0:10:47.160,0:10:56.340
Romans 13:3. "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."

0:10:56.340,0:10:57.340
Hallelujah!

0:10:57.340,0:10:58.480
Amen.

0:10:58.480,0:10:59.940
Hallelujah!

0:10:59.940,0:11:02.000
Amen.

0:11:02.000,0:11:05.520
Let's take our topic this way.

0:11:05.520,0:11:08.960
MESSAGE TITLE: Good Christians are Good Citizens

0:11:08.960,0:11:10.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:11:10.040,0:11:12.020
Good Christians are good citizens.

0:11:12.020,0:11:25.060
Going by Romans 13, the concepts of Christianity and good citizenship are inseparable.

0:11:25.060,0:11:39.860
They are both synonymous; both go in tandem, pari passu.

0:11:39.860,0:11:40.720
Tell your neighbour.

0:11:40.720,0:11:48.100
Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.

0:11:48.100,0:11:49.760
Tell your neighbour once again.

0:11:49.760,0:11:53.940
Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.

0:11:53.940,0:11:55.120
Yes.

0:11:55.120,0:11:58.020
When you look at the constitution of your country -

0:11:58.020,0:12:00.780
"thou shalt not kill, though shalt not destroy,

0:12:00.780,0:12:03.120
though shalt not this, though shalt not that."

0:12:03.120,0:12:10.660
Whatever makes you a good Christian, makes you a good citizen.

0:12:10.660,0:12:13.000
I am a good citizen.

0:12:13.000,0:12:14.160
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:14.160,0:12:16.280
I am a good citizen.

0:12:16.280,0:12:17.840
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:17.840,0:12:19.780
I am a good citizen.

0:12:19.780,0:12:27.380
If you are a good citizen, you must pray against broken homes.

0:12:27.380,0:12:32.480
Because at the beginning of marriage - for better, for worse.

0:12:32.480,0:12:46.860
In every law, once you get married - the law says: "For better, for worse; come rain, come shine."

0:12:46.860,0:12:50.220
Tell your neighbour: "I am a good citizen."

0:12:50.220,0:12:58.160
So if you are a good citizen, you must pray against broken homes.

0:12:58.160,0:13:10.500
I know, what it is to come from a broken home.

0:13:10.500,0:13:19.060
When I was one year old, I was left with my mum.

0:13:19.060,0:13:26.680
I know the pain and agony.

0:13:26.680,0:13:33.440
It is not the wish and it can never be the wish of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,

0:13:33.440,0:13:44.200
to see these children without motherly care at this young age.

0:13:44.200,0:13:48.660
Coming to the issue of faith.

0:13:48.660,0:13:55.920
I am a Christian; I am not a religious man.

0:13:55.920,0:14:08.060
Striving against people and standing on the pulpit and speaking against others -

0:14:08.060,0:14:15.120
we are fighting the wrong battle.

0:14:15.120,0:14:23.720
We are to battle the spiritual entities that cause tension,

0:14:23.720,0:14:27.340
killing, stealing and destruction.

0:14:27.340,0:14:35.580
We are not fighting the physical appearance that we are seeing.

0:14:35.580,0:14:40.460
Our battle is not against flesh and blood.

0:14:40.460,0:14:47.160
The Gospel of our Lord, Jesus Christ, is the Good News.

0:14:47.160,0:14:56.380
The message is righteousness. When you hear it, it gladens your heart.

0:14:56.380,0:15:08.860
We have the ability to preach. Jesus makes it happen in the person of the Holy Ghost.

0:15:08.860,0:15:14.960
As a Christian, you need to apply yourself to your work;

0:15:14.960,0:15:20.160
you need to apply yourself to your duty, as a Christian soldier.

0:15:20.160,0:15:21.360
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:21.360,0:15:29.400
Apply yourself to your work, to your duty, as a Christian soldier.

0:15:29.400,0:15:35.660
When soldiers in the physical world go to work, they carry guns, ammunition.

0:15:35.660,0:15:38.360
But we don't carry such things.

0:15:38.360,0:15:49.040
Our weapons are not this ammunition we see, the guns we see but spiritual.

0:15:49.040,0:15:58.320
It is not the physical appearance that is our enemy.

0:15:58.320,0:16:05.100
We are not fighting the physical appearance we are seeing.

0:16:05.100,0:16:13.500
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:16:13.500,0:16:14.560
Can you tell your neighbour.

0:16:14.560,0:16:21.980
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:16:21.980,0:16:24.800
Because if you are armed,

0:16:24.800,0:16:28.300
the Saviour that armed you will tell you the battle to fight.

0:16:28.300,0:16:32.900
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:32.960,0:16:34.160
Come, sir.

0:16:34.160,0:16:40.840
It is like I am telling this gentleman: "Oh, you are going to war. Have this weapon."

0:16:40.840,0:16:44.980
But if I will give you a weapon, I will tell you how to use it.

0:16:44.980,0:16:52.600
I won't just give you a weapon without teaching you or telling you, how to use it.

0:16:52.600,0:16:58.640
So the people that are fighting, striving against people,

0:16:58.640,0:17:01.760
standing on the pulpit,

0:17:01.760,0:17:04.840
speaking against others:

0:17:04.840,0:17:09.800
"That man is not good, that religion is not good, that person is not good" -

0:17:09.800,0:17:12.260
they are not armed.

0:17:12.260,0:17:17.560
If you are armed- the person that armed you, will tell you, how to use this weapon.

0:17:17.560,0:17:18.420
Tell your neighbour.

0:17:18.420,0:17:26.460
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:17:26.460,0:17:32.600
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:32.620,0:17:40.720
If we are not armed for battle, we will fight the wrong battle.

0:17:40.720,0:17:47.720
If we are not armed for battle, we will not be able to listen

0:17:47.720,0:17:50.160
to the inner voice of the Holy Spirit.

0:17:50.160,0:17:53.900
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:53.900,0:18:00.060
Like country to country, when they are going to war,

0:18:00.060,0:18:03.760
before they give you a weapon, they have to take you to some kind of training -

0:18:03.760,0:18:06.360
how to use a weapon, the time to use it.

0:18:06.360,0:18:09.120
The battalion leader will tell you.

0:18:09.120,0:18:13.720
They will appoint you to the battalion. This is the leader that will lead you into war.

0:18:13.720,0:18:20.060
And he will teach you, tell you time and when to shoot.

0:18:20.060,0:18:24.500
Without hearing the signal, you cannot shoot.

0:18:24.500,0:18:29.200
When you hear a certain signal, it is telling you that they are close.

0:18:29.200,0:18:32.060
They have a sign.

0:18:32.060,0:18:34.460
Each country has its sign.

0:18:34.460,0:18:38.520
That is why when the United Kingdom gives sign to its soldiers in battle,

0:18:38.520,0:18:40.820
Nigeria will not understand what they are saying.

0:18:40.820,0:18:43.400
If Nigeria gives sign to its soldiers,

0:18:43.400,0:18:47.680
the British government will also not understand what they are trying to say.

0:18:47.680,0:18:52.900
Because they give you arms, they must also tell you what to use, how to use it, and the time to use it.

0:18:52.900,0:18:53.540
Tell your neighbour.

0:18:53.540,0:18:59.880
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:18:59.880,0:19:04.580
If you are not armed for battle, you will not be able to listen

0:19:04.580,0:19:12.680
to the inner voice of the Holy Ghost.

0:19:12.680,0:19:23.100
The concepts of Christianity and good citizenship are inseparable.

0:19:23.100,0:19:27.660
They both are synonymous.

0:19:27.660,0:19:28.700
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:28.700,0:19:33.160
Good Christians are good citizens.

0:19:33.160,0:19:34.560
I can't hear you.

0:19:34.560,0:19:36.540
Good Christians are good citizens.

0:19:36.540,0:19:40.280
So, my brothers,

0:19:40.280,0:19:41.440
you have heard me.

0:19:41.440,0:19:43.800
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:43.840,0:19:53.560
I am to preach, teach, but Jesus makes it work;

0:19:53.560,0:19:58.640
Jesus makes it happen in the person of the Holy Ghost.

0:19:58.640,0:19:59.840
Thank you.

0:19:59.840,0:20:06.800
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:06.880,0:20:08.600
You have seen the family.

0:20:08.600,0:20:14.580
They will continue to live together.

0:20:14.580,0:20:19.100
The Lord is there to determine their faith.

0:20:19.100,0:20:24.120
If this man could be here with me for one week,

0:20:24.120,0:20:27.160
I would only tell him about my Lord Jesus Christ

0:20:27.160,0:20:37.160
but I have no power to force anyone to be a Christian.

0:20:37.160,0:20:43.160
I have no power of my own

0:20:43.160,0:20:54.720
Holy Spirit, I look upon You, help me

0:20:54.720,0:21:05.140
I have no power of my own

0:21:05.140,0:21:08.300
I want to change you at all cost;

0:21:08.300,0:21:10.880
you want to change me to your place too at all cost -

0:21:10.880,0:21:12.980
this is where crisis comes.

0:21:12.980,0:21:16.000
Faith is a thing of the Spirit.

0:21:16.000,0:21:17.880
Thank you. You may be seated.

0:21:17.880,0:21:22.600
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:22.640,0:21:26.540
Go and take care of your home.

0:21:26.540,0:21:28.400
Take care of these children.

0:21:28.400,0:21:33.120
For the past seven days now,

0:21:33.120,0:21:35.860
what marriage is all about -

0:21:35.860,0:21:38.760
he has learnt and seen it.

0:21:38.760,0:21:41.600
But one thing I have discovered in your family

0:21:41.600,0:21:50.340
that there is a spirit of mental disorder in your family.

0:21:50.340,0:21:58.180
There is a mental disorder in your family; if you go back to your home and check,

0:21:58.180,0:22:00.920
someone in your family is mental.

0:22:00.920,0:22:02.780
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:02.780,0:22:03.760
Who?

0:22:03.760,0:22:07.080
His name is Christian; he's my younger brother.

0:22:07.080,0:22:07.840
He's mental.

0:22:07.840,0:22:08.620
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:08.620,0:22:11.520
That thing is in the family; it started from your grandfather.

0:22:11.520,0:22:15.000
And you too have depression.

0:22:15.000,0:22:15.500
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:15.500,0:22:18.580
And when this depression comes, you can abandon home and walk out.

0:22:18.580,0:22:19.860
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:19.860,0:22:27.400
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:27.480,0:22:33.620
So this is what we have to work on.

0:22:33.620,0:22:37.000
We should not hide under faith

0:22:37.000,0:22:40.020
and begin to cause crisis.

0:22:40.020,0:22:42.380
Don't use faith to cover up.

0:22:42.380,0:22:44.560
"Jesus is Lord; Jesus is Deliverer" -

0:22:44.560,0:22:48.400
deliver them! "Jesus is Lord" - show them the Lord.

0:22:48.400,0:22:51.400
We should not use that to cover up and begin to preach.

0:22:51.400,0:22:56.780
But what of that spirit that kills, steals and destroys?

0:22:56.780,0:23:00.200
Look at what the Bible says in that verse 3.

0:23:00.200,0:23:07.300
It says in Romans 13:3: "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."

0:23:07.300,0:23:11.700
Love is very strong and we are known by our love.

0:23:11.700,0:23:14.500
For someone to be in the presence of God -

0:23:14.500,0:23:15.580
what else again?

0:23:15.580,0:23:19.900
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:19.960,0:23:24.900
Prophet T.B. Joshua is used by God Almighty, as a commissioned solution provider,

0:23:24.900,0:23:27.680
as speaking with divine wisdom and direction,

0:23:27.680,0:23:29.940
the Busari family is restored.

0:23:29.940,0:23:32.780
They affectionately embrace and kiss each other,

0:23:32.780,0:23:37.340
proving that their past is over and a happy future lies before them.

0:23:37.340,0:23:39.240
Thank you, Jesus Christ.

TESTIMONY TIME

0:23:54.040,0:23:59.240
I am Alhaji Busari from Kwara State.

0:23:59.240,0:24:01.720
You are welcome, sir. And who are the people standing beside you here?

0:24:01.720,0:24:02.920
They are my wife and children.

0:24:02.920,0:24:05.120
I thank God. I have seen big changes.

0:24:05.120,0:24:08.880
Before, my wife and I used to quarrel but immediately we came here,

0:24:08.880,0:24:12.980
she changed and is now behaving well.

0:24:12.980,0:24:15.440
We are now alright and no longer quarrel.

0:24:15.440,0:24:18.060
So there is peace restored in the marriage?

0:24:18.060,0:24:23.460
Yes, we've been living in peace since we came here.

0:24:23.460,0:24:28.600
Before you came here, is it true that both of you have been separated for some weeks?

0:24:28.600,0:24:33.400
Yes, we separated; I asked her to go but now we have settled.

0:24:33.400,0:24:36.840
And how do you now see your family, the peace that is in your family,

0:24:36.840,0:24:39.220
and the way you are treating your wife and your children?

0:24:39.220,0:24:44.100
I thank God that there is now peace. Peace has been restored in my family.

0:24:44.180,0:24:52.640
2. Corinthians 5:18 states: "Now all things are of God who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ

0:24:52.640,0:24:56.060
and has given us the ministry of reconciliation."

0:24:56.060,0:25:00.940
Not only was the Busari family restored and reconciled through God's wisdom

0:25:00.940,0:25:08.520
but they were also given a cash gift of 300,000 naira by Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:25:08.520,0:25:12.500
He gave us 300,000 naira.

0:25:12.500,0:25:16.660
I thank him very much for giving us this money.

0:25:16.660,0:25:18.040
He is a true man of God.

0:25:18.040,0:25:20.540
So you were not expecting anything like this?

0:25:20.540,0:25:23.220
I was very surprised to see the amount of money he gave me and my family.

0:25:23.220,0:25:25.120
It is a lot of money for us.

0:25:25.120,0:25:29.980
So what can you say concerning how God is using Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:25:29.980,0:25:32.980
God is using him to help many people.

0:25:32.980,0:25:38.220
If not for the man of God, my wife and I would have been divorced by now.

0:25:38.220,0:25:44.980
We really thank God Almighty for your life. And what are you going to use this money for now?

0:25:44.980,0:25:50.360
I will use it for my business and to take care of my family.

0:25:50.360,0:25:52.640
Wonderful. We thank God.

0:25:52.640,0:25:56.760
Finally, after all that God has done for you, what do you want to tell viewers

0:25:56.760,0:26:01.260
about what Jesus is doing, what God Almighty is doing here in The SCOAN?

0:26:01.260,0:26:05.100
Although I have been watching Emmanuel TV and I know what he can do,

0:26:05.100,0:26:07.860
I thank God that if anybody has a problem like me,

0:26:07.860,0:26:11.420
they can run to him and he will solve it.

0:26:11.420,0:26:16.520
My name is Mrs Rosemary Busari. I am from Edo State.

0:26:16.520,0:26:20.040
The man next to me is my husband, and these are my children.

0:26:20.040,0:26:25.460
God has done a very wonderful thing in my life and family.

0:26:25.460,0:26:29.760
Before I came here, there were problems in my family and marriage -

0:26:29.760,0:26:34.000
terrible problems. We could not stay together without quarrelling.

0:26:34.000,0:26:38.560
He finally sent me out and this was not the first time he had sent me out.

0:26:38.560,0:26:40.880
When I came to The SCOAN, to my surprise,

0:26:40.880,0:26:45.840
the man of God singled me out from the multitude of people that were around.

0:26:45.840,0:26:50.880
He prayed for me, called my family and reunited us.

0:26:50.880,0:26:53.620
Now, we are living together happily.

0:26:53.620,0:26:56.600
I am grateful to God and the man of God.

0:26:56.600,0:27:02.240
Today, he gave us 300,000 naira.

0:27:02.240,0:27:06.720
For us to use and be happy. I thank God.

0:27:06.720,0:27:11.400
So since you came to this church, God has now reconciled you with your husband

0:27:11.400,0:27:12.820
and restored peace to the family.

0:27:12.820,0:27:16.520
Just tell us the changes you have been seeing in your marriage and family now.

0:27:16.520,0:27:23.240
We are together now but before now, we didn't stay together.

0:27:23.240,0:27:26.980
Jesus Christ loves us and is concerned about us.

0:27:26.980,0:27:29.760
He wants to be involved in everything about us

0:27:29.760,0:27:32.340
and walk us through whatever life brings.

0:27:32.340,0:27:36.860
If God is involved in our matter, it does not matter who else is involved.

0:27:36.860,0:27:39.120
My name is Wasiu Busari.

0:27:39.120,0:27:41.680
This is my father, my mum and my brothers.

0:27:41.680,0:27:45.100
I thank God for the reconciliation of my father, mother and brothers.

0:27:45.100,0:27:47.100
For three weeks, my father and mother were separated.

0:27:47.100,0:27:51.680
It was only my father, who took care of us; I didn't know where my mum went.

0:27:51.680,0:27:55.960
But I am happy now that Prophet T.B. Joshua has brought us back together

0:27:55.960,0:27:59.100
and we are now inseparable.

0:27:59.100,0:28:01.620
So you are very happy now that peace is back in this family?

0:28:01.620,0:28:03.060
Yes.

0:28:03.060,0:28:08.300
We thank God. Do you believe now with your parents back together

0:28:08.300,0:28:13.520
that you have a very bright future and as you go to school, you'll become someone great in the future?

0:28:13.520,0:28:14.540
Yes, I believe.

0:28:14.540,0:28:16.200
My name is Baniki Busari.

0:28:16.200,0:28:17.520
Who are the people beside you?

0:28:17.520,0:28:20.180
This is my dad, my mum and my brothers.

0:28:20.180,0:28:24.040
