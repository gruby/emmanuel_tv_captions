0:00:00.280,0:00:04.200
During a Sunday live service, at the Synagogue Church of All Nations,

0:00:04.320,0:00:08.520
Prophet T.B. Joshua led by the Spirit of God, moves in the midst of the people;

0:00:08.540,0:00:12.300
prophesying to them, revealing the root cause of their problems.

0:00:12.820,0:00:15.160
Let's listen as he speaks to this woman.

0:00:15.400,0:00:16.120
How are you?

0:00:16.160,0:00:16.840
Fine, sir.

0:00:18.100,0:00:21.220
There is a controversy over a child.

0:00:21.220,0:00:22.000
Yes Sir.

0:00:26.060,0:00:31.640
After Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to the woman that there was a controversy over a child,

0:00:31.700,0:00:36.000
the Man of God invited her husband to come to the Synagogue Church of All Nations

0:00:36.000,0:00:37.640
the following Sunday.

0:00:37.820,0:00:42.120
Let's watch as God Almighty opens the case file of this family.

0:00:43.220,0:00:44.340
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:44.680,0:00:48.520
My name is Rosemary Isibor Busari. I am from Edo State.

0:00:49.160,0:00:51.200
Last  week Sunday,  first service,

0:00:51.200,0:00:54.500
The Man of God  came  to me and prophesied to me.

0:00:54.860,0:00:58.820
He said there was a controversy over a child and the prophecy is true.

0:01:00.180,0:01:05.920
My children are  there: the first one, the second one, I lost the third one.

0:01:06.160,0:01:09.640
The first one is the one the Man of God was talking about.

0:01:09.640,0:01:14.600
I discovered that the father would beat him all the time

0:01:14.600,0:01:17.560
Even when the child made very little mistakes,

0:01:17.560,0:01:19.740
where one should just say, "Don't do that again"

0:01:19.760,0:01:21.220
and let the child correct himself.

0:01:21.220,0:01:25.860
But he would beat him as if he was a goat and wanted to kill him.

0:01:26.060,0:01:29.580
I didn't like what was happening so I told my husband

0:01:29.580,0:01:32.780
that the way this was going was not really good

0:01:32.780,0:01:38.000
and that he should rather just correct the child and that would settle it.

0:01:38.000,0:01:42.620
He got angry with me and said that he was not the father of the child.

0:01:42.760,0:01:46.960
He told me that because I said the way he was beating the child was not right,

0:01:47.160,0:01:48.720
that I should take the child to the father.

0:01:48.720,0:01:54.020
They even called a family meeting, asking me who the father was.

0:01:54.140,0:01:57.460
I said that he was the father, that there was no other man to call father.

0:01:57.460,0:01:58.700
He is the father.

0:01:58.740,0:02:00.460
I am married to him. He is the father.

0:02:00.640,0:02:03.760
I said that I didn't come to this house with any child.

0:02:03.860,0:02:07.260
There was another instance when the child went to

0:02:07.280,0:02:08.820
take his Common Entrance Examination.

0:02:09.040,0:02:12.680
Because the time the child told him to collect him was different

0:02:12.680,0:02:16.660
from the time they finished. So the child was the only one left and

0:02:16.660,0:02:20.060
the school decided to take him back to their own school

0:02:20.060,0:02:22.380
as the exam took place in another school.

0:02:22.380,0:02:26.260
When the father got to the other school and couldn't find him,

0:02:26.260,0:02:28.840
he went to his own school and found him there.

0:02:28.840,0:02:31.940
He then brought him out of the class and took him far away,

0:02:31.940,0:02:34.920
where no one would see him and started beating him.

0:02:35.080,0:02:38.600
It was so severe that it was only through the intervention of some parents

0:02:38.600,0:02:40.160
that came to pick up their own children

0:02:40.160,0:02:44.540
and the security officer of the school that the child was rescued.

0:02:44.760,0:02:48.800
He was insisting that they should leave him, that he wanted to kill the child

0:02:48.800,0:02:50.640
or let the child kill him.

0:02:51.920,0:02:56.260
He has sent me out of the house because I told him that the drugs

0:02:56.260,0:03:01.020
he bought for the fourth child, he was reacting negatively to them

0:03:01.020,0:03:02.600
and that he should stop taking the drugs.

0:03:02.600,0:03:05.240
That was why he sent me out of the house.

0:03:05.500,0:03:10.760
The third child that died, he also bought the drugs I gave to the child.

0:03:10.760,0:03:12.620
The next morning, the child died.

0:03:13.040,0:03:14.200
So, the question now!

0:03:14.540,0:03:16.780
He said he is not the father of the child?

0:03:16.880,0:03:17.600
Yes, sir.

0:03:17.900,0:03:20.740
I am Yahaya Busari.

0:03:23.240,0:03:26.840
This is my first time of coming to church. I am a muslim.

0:03:27.760,0:03:29.040
This is my ex-wife.

0:03:29.320,0:03:34.740
I first of all want to thank you for the honour you have given to me and to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:03:34.880,0:03:37.520
So before you talk: Thank you very much.

0:03:40.300,0:03:48.160
Thank you. Because every man has discretion. As a Muslim, Alhaji, with your position,

0:03:48.880,0:03:54.680
you heard that T.B. Joshua said this and you did not mind.

0:03:54.680,0:03:57.320
This is the first time you enter into a church in your life.

0:03:57.960,0:04:03.860
You said that T.B. Joshua - I will enter his church today. I want to say thank you very much for the honour.

0:04:05.240,0:04:09.520
He who honours a Prophet will receive a Prophet's reward.

0:04:09.720,0:04:10.500
Amen.

0:04:10.540,0:04:14.600
Before you talk, I want to appreciate this. Thank you very much.

0:04:14.740,0:04:18.380
The bottom line of this matter is that these are my children

0:04:18.380,0:04:25.660
but whenever I want to correct my children, my wife will slap me.

0:04:26.240,0:04:29.340
They all see me as a stranger in my house.

0:04:29.340,0:04:33.200
If I enter my house, I will feel like a stranger. They no longer love me.

0:04:33.200,0:04:35.200
She turned the attention of our children to only herself.

0:04:36.480,0:04:39.500
About one month ago, I went out in the evening.

0:04:39.500,0:04:42.300
She called me that my son was ill.

0:04:42.580,0:04:44.220
I panicked and came home immediately.

0:04:44.580,0:04:52.360
I took both of them, Ramani and Maliki, straight to the pharmacy

0:04:52.720,0:04:57.360
They gave them drugs. I didn't know that one of the drugs was garlic.

0:04:57.840,0:05:01.740
When you chew garlic, it will be smelling and has an offensive odour.

0:05:02.400,0:05:05.260
I gave the drugs to the children.

0:05:05.560,0:05:07.580
My wife then called me in the presence of the children

0:05:07.580,0:05:09.320
and asked me why I gave them these drugs;

0:05:09.620,0:05:12.300
whether I wanted to kill them.

0:05:13.080,0:05:15.080
She said I was a ritualist who wanted to kill her children

0:05:15.860,0:05:18.040
She slaps me all the time in the presence of my children.

0:05:18.300,0:05:27.600
In short, I told her that since I am now a stranger in my house and a ritualist,

0:05:27.600,0:05:30.000
she should go and look for the father of the children.

0:05:30.720,0:05:33.020
That was why I told her that I am no longer their father.

0:05:35.220,0:05:41.400
This is a lesson to all of us. If I am standing here condemning flesh and blood,

0:05:42.020,0:05:45.600
Condemning my neighbor, fighting people by name.

0:05:45.800,0:05:53.180
If I would say, "Alhaji - these people are not good, this pastor is not good", Alaji will not come here today.

0:05:53.640,0:05:59.740
This is an opportunity for me to tell him about my God and he will tell me about his own God.

0:06:05.080,0:06:12.520
Alaji, these children are living with you? How about that baby?

0:06:14.100,0:06:16.420
I have been taking care of them by myself since that time.

0:06:16.700,0:06:17.260
This baby?

0:06:17.720,0:06:19.080
Yes. I bathe him; I don't go anywhere.

0:06:19.500,0:06:20.940
Please, Man of God, you can ask them.

0:06:21.460,0:06:27.780
For the past three weeks, I bathe them. I bath this small boy two times a day - in the morning and evening.

0:06:28.140,0:06:31.140
I feed them and cook for them by myself since she left my house.

0:06:31.640,0:06:34.200
They are my children; all of them.

0:06:37.640,0:06:43.020
She says you are beating this child, to the extent of saying he is no longer your child!

0:06:43.060,0:06:48.640
If this man really means that this child is not his own, why should he take them?

0:06:49.700,0:06:53.300
Why should he not allow you to take the one that is not his own?

0:06:53.800,0:06:57.820
But he took all of them and is living with all of them.

0:06:58.540,0:07:08.080
There are two issues now: The issue could be because of faith; that is, she is a Christian; he is a Muslim.

0:07:08.100,0:07:12.840
Maybe at the beginning; I am telling you vision, what is happening in the house.

0:07:12.840,0:07:17.020
They do not want to mention that but I am telling you some secret things that happened.

0:07:17.380,0:07:22.300
When they first married, the man is a Muslim, and she married him.

0:07:22.300,0:07:24.620
They were together and have many issues.

0:07:25.340,0:07:30.240
But later she now began to say that she does not want to be a Muslim but a Christian.

0:07:30.720,0:07:34.520
That would begin to cause what? if the husband says no!!

0:07:35.640,0:07:36.640
Exactly. She always says so.

0:07:36.860,0:07:38.420
Clap for Jesus Christ! Rise up!

0:07:39.200,0:07:40.780
Rise up! Rise up!

0:07:43.960,0:07:45.660
They would not mention that.

0:07:46.560,0:07:50.300
There are many issues between husband and wife that they will not mention.

0:07:51.800,0:07:53.340
But as a pastor, I know.

0:07:53.960,0:07:58.180
Your first time entering the church as Alaji and you have never done so.

0:08:00.060,0:08:02.960
And you honour that invitation because of these children.

0:08:03.820,0:08:08.260
And you people are here and not even telling us the real reason why you are fighting.

0:08:08.760,0:08:11.080
But not until I said this is the cause.

0:08:11.340,0:08:12.920
And you are now saying: Yes, this is the cause.

0:08:13.680,0:08:16.900
Man of God, when they called me to say that I should come,

0:08:17.140,0:08:20.120
I said I must go straight away, since it was T.B. Joshua that invited me.

0:08:20.640,0:08:23.620
Because I watch your programme every day in my house. You can ask her.

0:08:23.900,0:08:24.600
Both day and night.

0:08:26.100,0:08:26.680
You can ask her.

0:08:27.080,0:08:27.900
You can ask her, Man of God.

0:08:28.360,0:08:29.840
You can ask any of my children.

0:08:30.300,0:08:32.080
He watches Emmanuel TV every day - even in the night.

0:08:32.080,0:08:35.340
When I would be sleeping and have to go to the bathroom, I would see him.

0:08:35.340,0:08:39.080
He would be glued to the television every night, watching Emmanuel TV.

0:08:39.920,0:08:42.980
My father watches Emmanuel TV every day.

0:08:42.980,0:08:47.320
That's how we were able to come here and solve this problem.

0:08:49.040,0:08:50.500
It is true.

0:08:51.140,0:08:54.420
I said, "As far as it is T.B. Joshua, I will be there immediately". I moved.

0:08:54.800,0:08:55.360
Thank you.

0:08:58.160,0:09:03.600
Please, Man of God, my wife said that I killed her father and my own son.

0:09:04.060,0:09:05.300
She said that I am a ritualist.

0:09:05.740,0:09:09.320
That is one of the reasons why I am here so that you can touch me

0:09:09.320,0:09:13.880
and let me confess how I killed her father and my own son.

0:09:14.600,0:09:15.100
Ok.

0:09:16.180,0:09:17.260
No, wait.

0:09:17.520,0:09:19.560
Next week, we will continue this.

0:09:19.960,0:09:24.380
But I want to assure you that the wisdom of Solomon is still there.

0:09:29.840,0:09:31.200
Thank you very much.

0:09:34.860,0:09:41.020
The following Sunday, God continued to use Prophet T.B. Joshua to demonstrate the wisdom of Solomon

0:09:41.020,0:09:43.020
in the life of this couple.

0:09:43.020,0:09:45.460
What is God's opinion concerning this family?

0:09:45.960,0:09:48.360
Will reconciliation be possible?

0:09:48.380,0:09:50.440
Let's watch what happened next.

0:09:51.580,0:09:54.120
Let's take a look at the book of Romans 13.

0:09:58.340,0:10:00.840
Let me take a reading from the verse 1.

0:10:00.840,0:10:01.900
I read

0:10:02.400,0:10:07.220
"Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities.

0:10:07.720,0:10:11.080
For there is no authority except from God,

0:10:11.680,0:10:16.260
and the authorities that exist are appointed by God.

0:10:17.300,0:10:18.080
Verse 2.

0:10:18.600,0:10:24.820
Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God,

0:10:26.420,0:10:31.740
and those who resist will bring judgement on themselves.

0:10:32.660,0:10:33.240
Verse 3.

0:10:33.680,0:10:40.240
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."

0:10:41.540,0:10:44.420
Let's read it together and take note of that. Write it in your paper.

0:10:44.740,0:10:46.580
That is the area we want to take about.

0:10:47.160,0:10:55.380
Romans 13:3. "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."

0:10:56.300,0:10:57.080
Halleluja!

0:10:57.300,0:10:58.040
Amen.

0:10:58.440,0:10:59.660
Halleluja!

0:10:59.900,0:11:01.220
Amen.

0:11:01.940,0:11:04.340
Let's take our topic this way.

0:11:05.480,0:11:08.040
Message Title: Good Christians are Good Citizens

0:11:08.900,0:11:10.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:11:10.040,0:11:11.840
Good Christians are good citizens.

0:11:11.840,0:11:22.900
Going by Romans 13, the concepts of Christianity and good citizenship are inseparable.

0:11:25.120,0:11:37.860
They are both synonymous; both go in tandem, pari passu.

0:11:39.960,0:11:40.640
Tell your neighbour.

0:11:40.780,0:11:47.780
Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.

0:11:48.080,0:11:49.360
Tell your neighbour once again.

0:11:49.740,0:11:53.680
Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.

0:11:53.920,0:11:54.680
Yes.

0:11:55.100,0:11:58.020
When you look at your constitution in your country,

0:11:58.020,0:12:00.780
thou shalt not kill, though shalt not destroy,

0:12:00.780,0:12:02.940
though shalt not this, though shalt not that.

0:12:02.940,0:12:08.320
Whatever makes you a good Christian, makes you a good citizen.

0:12:10.720,0:12:12.120
I am a good citizen.

0:12:13.040,0:12:13.960
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:14.240,0:12:16.020
I am a good citizen.

0:12:16.280,0:12:17.720
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:17.820,0:12:19.260
I am a good citizen.

0:12:19.760,0:12:25.180
If you are a good citizen, you must pray against broken homes.

0:12:27.360,0:12:31.360
Because at the beginning of marriage - for better, for worse.

0:12:32.440,0:12:44.460
In every law, once you get married - the law says for better, for worse; come rain, come shine.

0:12:46.860,0:12:50.220
Tell your neighbour: I am a good citizen.

0:12:50.220,0:12:54.940
So if you are a good citizen, you must pray against broken homes.

0:12:58.080,0:13:10.040
I know what it is to come from a broken home.

0:13:10.240,0:13:18.740
When I was one year old, I was left with my mum.

0:13:19.020,0:13:26.200
I know the pain and agony.

0:13:26.440,0:13:33.440
It is not the wish and it can never be the wish of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,

0:13:33.440,0:13:42.680
to see these children without motherly care at this young age.

0:13:44.180,0:13:46.780
Coming to the issue of faith.

0:13:48.660,0:13:54.060
I am a Christian; I am not a religious man.

0:13:56.040,0:14:06.580
Striving against people and standing on the pulpit and speaking against others -

0:14:08.020,0:14:14.560
we are fighting the wrong battle.

0:14:15.180,0:14:23.720
We are to battle the spiritual entities that cause tension,

0:14:23.720,0:14:26.360
killing, stealing and destruction.

0:14:27.300,0:14:35.360
We are not fighting the physical appearance that we are seeing.

0:14:35.580,0:14:40.060
Our battle is not against flesh and blood.

0:14:40.400,0:14:45.040
The Gospel of our Lord, Jesus Christ, is the Good News.

0:14:47.260,0:14:56.100
The message is righteousness. When you hear it, it gladdens your heart.

0:14:56.360,0:15:08.440
We have the ability to preach. Jesus makes it happen in the person of the Holy Ghost.

0:15:08.840,0:15:14.740
As a Christian, you need to apply yourself to your work;

0:15:14.740,0:15:19.940
you need to apply yourself to your duty, as a Christian soldier.

0:15:20.100,0:15:21.180
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:21.360,0:15:28.800
Apply yourself to your work, to your duty, as a Christian soldier.

0:15:29.380,0:15:35.240
When soldiers in the physical world are going to war, they carry guns, ammunition.

0:15:35.640,0:15:37.840
But we don't carry such things.

0:15:38.360,0:15:48.800
Our weapons are not this ammunition we see, the guns we see but spiritual.

0:15:49.000,0:15:56.240
It is not the physical appearance that is our enemy.

0:15:58.280,0:16:03.260
We are not fighting the physical appearance we are seeing.

0:16:05.100,0:16:12.000
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:16:13.480,0:16:14.540
Can you tell your neighbour.

0:16:14.560,0:16:21.920
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:16:22.060,0:16:23.460
Because if you are armed,

0:16:24.680,0:16:28.300
the Saviour that armed you will tell you the battle to fight.

0:16:32.960,0:16:33.680
Come, sir.

0:16:34.160,0:16:40.500
It is like I am telling this gentleman: Oh, you are going to war. Have this weapon.

0:16:40.840,0:16:44.300
But before will I give you a weapon, I will tell you how to use it.

0:16:44.960,0:16:49.600
I won't just give you a weapon without teaching you or telling you how to use it.

0:16:52.460,0:16:57.820
So, the people that are fighting, striving against people,

0:16:58.620,0:17:00.620
standing on the pulpit,

0:17:01.740,0:17:03.920
speaking against others,

0:17:04.820,0:17:09.220
that man is not good, that religious person is not good, that person is not good,

0:17:09.800,0:17:11.500
they are not armed.

0:17:12.260,0:17:17.080
If you are armed, the person that armed you will tell you how to use this weapon.

0:17:17.620,0:17:18.420
Tell your neighbour.

0:17:18.420,0:17:25.260
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:17:25.260,0:17:27.260
Sit down

0:17:32.620,0:17:40.240
If we are not armed for battle, we will fight the wrong battle.

0:17:40.840,0:17:47.560
If we are not armed for battle, we will not be able to listen

0:17:47.660,0:17:53.140
to the inner voice of the Holy Spirit.

0:17:53.140,0:17:53.900
Ok

0:17:53.900,0:17:59.280
Like country to country, when they are going to war,

0:18:00.000,0:18:03.500
before they give you a weapon, they have to take you to some kind of training -

0:18:03.760,0:18:06.120
on how to use a weapon, the time to use it.

0:18:06.340,0:18:08.740
The battalion leader will tell you.

0:18:09.180,0:18:13.420
They will appoint you to the battalion. This is the leader that will lead you into war.

0:18:13.720,0:18:19.600
And he will teach you, tell you the time and when to shoot.

0:18:20.020,0:18:23.120
Without hearing the signal, you cannot shoot.

0:18:24.400,0:18:28.020
When you hear a certain signal from the leader, he is telling you that they are close.

0:18:29.180,0:18:31.780
They have a sign.

0:18:32.120,0:18:33.880
Each country has its sign.

0:18:34.460,0:18:38.520
That is why when the United Kingdom gives sign to its soldiers in battle,

0:18:38.520,0:18:40.760
Nigerian will not understand what they are saying.

0:18:40.920,0:18:43.060
So also If Nigeria gives sign to its soldiers,

0:18:43.400,0:18:47.200
the British government will also not understand what they are trying to say.

0:18:47.660,0:18:52.620
Because they give you arms, they must also tell you what to use, how to use it, and the time to use it.

0:18:53.000,0:18:53.540
Tell your neighbour.

0:18:53.540,0:18:59.540
If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.

0:18:59.840,0:19:04.560
If you are not armed for battle, you will not be able to listen

0:19:04.620,0:19:12.160
to the inner voice of the Holy Ghost.

0:19:12.360,0:19:22.880
The concepts of Christianity and good citizenship are inseparable.

0:19:23.160,0:19:26.780
They both are synonymous.

0:19:27.660,0:19:28.420
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:28.760,0:19:32.600
Good Christians are good citizens.

0:19:33.120,0:19:34.240
I can't hear you.

0:19:34.560,0:19:36.280
Good Christians are good citizens.

0:19:36.500,0:19:39.960
So, my brothers,

0:19:40.240,0:19:43.700
you have heard me.

0:19:43.840,0:19:52.380
I am to preach, teach, but Jesus makes it work;

0:19:53.540,0:19:58.500
Jesus makes it happen in the person of the Holy Ghost.

0:19:58.720,0:20:02.760
Thank you.

0:20:06.880,0:20:08.320
You have seen the family.

0:20:08.620,0:20:12.240
They will continue to live together

0:20:12.240,0:20:14.240
And

0:20:14.660,0:20:17.680
The Lord is there to determine their faith.

0:20:19.080,0:20:23.400
If this man can be here with me for one week,

0:20:24.100,0:20:26.860
I would only tell him about my Lord Jesus Christ

0:20:27.160,0:20:30.540
but I have no power to force anyone to be a Christian.

0:20:37.100,0:20:42.900
I have no power of my own

0:20:43.140,0:20:54.740
Holy Spirit, I look upon You, help me

0:20:54.780,0:21:03.360
I have no power of my own

0:21:05.160,0:21:07.600
I want to change you at all cost;

0:21:08.280,0:21:10.840
you want to change me to your place too at all cost -

0:21:10.960,0:21:12.340
this is where crisis comes.

0:21:13.000,0:21:15.040
Faith is a thing of the Spirit.

0:21:15.960,0:21:17.880
Thank you. You may be seated.

0:21:22.640,0:21:25.660
Go and take care of your home.

0:21:26.540,0:21:27.800
Take care of these children.

0:21:28.380,0:21:32.440
For the past seven days now,

0:21:33.080,0:21:34.640
what marriage is all about

0:21:35.840,0:21:38.200
he has learnt and seen it.

0:21:38.740,0:21:40.860
But one thing I have discovered in your family,

0:21:41.560,0:21:49.340
is that there is a spirit of mental in your family.

0:21:50.360,0:21:56.200
There is a mental disorder in your family; if you go back to your home and check.

0:21:58.120,0:22:00.420
Someone in your family is mental.

0:22:00.880,0:22:02.280
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:02.800,0:22:03.360
Who?

0:22:03.740,0:22:06.900
His name is Christian; he's my younger brother.

0:22:07.140,0:22:07.840
He's mental.

0:22:07.840,0:22:08.580
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:08.620,0:22:11.060
That thing is in the family; it started from your grandfather.

0:22:11.640,0:22:14.720
And you too have depression.

0:22:15.000,0:22:15.500
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:15.500,0:22:18.500
And when this depression comes, you can abandon home and walk out.

0:22:18.560,0:22:22.140
Yes, Man of God.

0:22:27.620,0:22:32.200
So this is what we have to work on.

0:22:33.600,0:22:36.320
We should not hide under faith

0:22:36.980,0:22:39.560
and begin to cause crisis.

0:22:40.120,0:22:41.960
Don't use faith to cover up.

0:22:42.360,0:22:44.520
Jesus is Lord; Jesus is Deliverer.

0:22:44.540,0:22:47.420
Deliver them! Jesus is Lord. Show them the Lord.

0:22:48.360,0:22:51.400
We should not use that to cover up and begin to preach

0:22:51.400,0:22:55.820
but what of that spirit that kills, steals and destroys.

0:22:56.740,0:22:59.540
Look at what the Bible says in that verse 3.

0:23:00.200,0:23:05.940
It says in Romans 13:3. "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."

0:23:07.260,0:23:10.400
Love is very strong and we are known by our love.

0:23:11.660,0:23:14.360
For someone to be in the presence of God,

0:23:14.460,0:23:17.780
what else again.

0:23:20.040,0:23:24.840
Prophet T.B. Joshua is used by God Almighty as a commissioned solution provider,

0:23:24.920,0:23:27.680
as speaking with divine wisdom and direction,

0:23:27.780,0:23:29.980
the Busari family is restored.

0:23:30.000,0:23:32.780
They affectionately embrace and kiss each other,

0:23:32.780,0:23:37.160
proving that their past is over and a happy future lies before them.

0:23:37.340,0:23:39.240
Thank you, Jesus Christ.

0:23:53.960,0:23:57.740
I am Alhaji Busari from Kwara State.

0:23:59.300,0:24:01.420
You are welcome, sir. And who are the people standing beside you here?

0:24:01.720,0:24:02.920
They are my wife and children.

0:24:02.920,0:24:05.120
I thank God. I have seen big changes.

0:24:05.120,0:24:08.460
Before, my wife and I used to quarrel but immediately we came here,

0:24:08.460,0:24:12.980
she changed and is now behaving well.

0:24:12.980,0:24:14.820
We are now alright and no longer quarrel.

0:24:15.300,0:24:17.440
So there is peace restored in the marriage?

0:24:18.040,0:24:22.380
Yes, we've been living in peace since we came here.

0:24:23.400,0:24:28.600
Before you came here, is it true that both of you have been separated for some weeks?

0:24:28.600,0:24:33.180
Yes, we separated; I asked her to go but now we have settled.

0:24:33.320,0:24:39.120
And how do you now see your family, the peace that is in your family, and the way you are treating your wife and your children?

0:24:39.120,0:24:42.760
I thank God that there is now peace. Peace has been restored in my family.

0:24:44.180,0:24:52.720
2. Corinthians 5:18 states: "Now all things are of God who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ

0:24:52.740,0:24:56.060
and has given us the ministry of reconciliation."

0:24:56.060,0:25:01.060
Not only was the Busari family restored and reconciled through God's wisdom

0:25:01.080,0:25:08.160
but they were also given a cash gift of 300,000 Naira by Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:25:08.500,0:25:12.220
He gave to us 300,000 Naira.

0:25:12.500,0:25:15.640
I thank him very much for giving us this money.

0:25:16.600,0:25:18.040
He is a true man of God.

0:25:18.040,0:25:20.540
So you were not expecting anything like this?

0:25:20.540,0:25:23.220
I was very surprised to see the amount of money he gave me and my family.

0:25:23.220,0:25:24.800
It is a lot of money for us.

0:25:25.080,0:25:29.300
So what can you say concerning how God is using Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:25:29.920,0:25:32.980
God is using him to help many people.

0:25:32.980,0:25:36.400
If not for the Man of God, my wife and I would have been divorced by now.

0:25:38.180,0:25:44.100
We really thank God Almighty for your life. And what are you going to use this money for now?

0:25:44.940,0:25:49.340
I will use it for my business and to take care of my family.

0:25:50.320,0:25:52.000
Wonderful. We thank God.

0:25:52.640,0:25:56.680
Finally, after all that God has done for you, what do you want to tell viewers

0:25:56.720,0:26:02.280
about what Jesus is doing, what God Almighty is doing here in The Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) ?

0:26:03.160,0:26:05.100
Although I have been watching Emmanuel TV and I know what he can do,

0:26:05.100,0:26:07.860
but I thank God that if anybody has a problem like me,

0:26:07.860,0:26:11.200
they can run to him and he will solve it.

0:26:11.500,0:26:15.700
My name is Mrs Rosemary Busari. I am from Edo State.

0:26:16.480,0:26:19.740
The man next to me is my husband, and these are my children.

0:26:20.120,0:26:24.920
God has done a very wonderful thing in my life and family.

0:26:25.560,0:26:29.520
Before I came here, there were problems in my family and marriage -

0:26:29.740,0:26:33.940
terrible problems. We could not stay together without quarrelling.

0:26:34.260,0:26:38.180
He finally sent me out and this was not the first time he had sent me out.

0:26:38.600,0:26:40.880
When I came to the Scoan, to my surprise,

0:26:40.880,0:26:45.320
the Man of God singled me out from the multitude of people that were around.

0:26:45.820,0:26:50.880
He prayed for me, called my family and reunited us.

0:26:50.880,0:26:53.140
Now, we are living together happily.

0:26:53.600,0:26:56.360
I am grateful to God and the Man of God.

0:26:56.660,0:27:01.740
Today, he gave us 300,000 Naira.

0:27:02.240,0:27:05.720
For us to use and be happy. I thank God.

0:27:06.700,0:27:11.340
So since you came to this church, God has now reconciled you with your husband

0:27:11.400,0:27:12.820
and restored peace to the family.

0:27:12.820,0:27:16.040
Just tell us the changes you have been seeing in your marriage and family now.

0:27:16.500,0:27:22.620
We are together now but before now, we didn't stay together.

0:27:23.320,0:27:27.040
Jesus Christ loves us and is concerned about us.

0:27:27.060,0:27:29.760
He wants to be involved in everything about us

0:27:29.760,0:27:32.180
and walk us through whatever life brings.

0:27:32.380,0:27:36.860
If God is involved in our matter, it does not matter who else is involved.

0:27:36.860,0:27:38.560
My name is Wasiu Busari.

0:27:39.120,0:27:41.580
This is my father, my mum and my brothers.

0:27:41.620,0:27:44.880
I thank God for the reconciliation of my father, mother and brothers.

0:27:45.080,0:27:47.100
For three weeks, my father and mother were separated.

0:27:47.100,0:27:51.500
It was only my father who took care of us; I didn't know where my mum went.

0:27:51.740,0:27:55.900
But I am happy now that Prophet T.B. Joshua has brought us back together

0:27:55.940,0:27:58.160
and we are now inseparable.

0:27:59.080,0:28:01.620
So you are very happy now that peace is back in this family?

0:28:01.680,0:28:02.180
Yes.

0:28:03.100,0:28:08.300
We thank God. Do you believe now with your parents back together

0:28:08.300,0:28:13.400
that you have a very bright future as you go to school you become someone great in the future?

0:28:13.600,0:28:14.400
Yes, I believe.

0:28:14.620,0:28:15.800
My name is Baniki Busari.

0:28:16.180,0:28:17.520
Who are the people beside you?

0:28:17.520,0:28:20.060
This is my dad, my mum and my brothers.

0:28:20.260,0:28:23.980
Just tell us what God has done for this family since you came to the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN)

0:28:24.000,0:28:29.760
I thank God for what Prophet T.B. Joshua has done in the life of my parents.

0:28:31.820,0:28:35.660
Before, there were always, fights, quarrels and arguments.

0:28:35.680,0:28:38.580
But now, I thank God for what He has done in our lives.

0:28:38.720,0:28:39.840
Now there is peace?

0:28:39.840,0:28:41.840
Yes, it is true, I believe.

0:28:42.400,0:28:45.740
Wonderful. We thank God Almighty for the peace that has been restored to this family.

0:28:46.220,0:28:47.520
My name is Ramoni Busari.

0:28:47.740,0:28:49.020
Who are the people beside you?

0:28:50.140,0:28:54.840
This is my father, my mum and my brothers.

0:28:55.500,0:28:58.260
Just tell us what God has done for your family.

0:28:59.420,0:29:04.200
Before, my mother and father were separated but they are together now.

0:29:04.300,0:29:05.640
And you are very happy for that?

0:29:05.800,0:29:06.300
