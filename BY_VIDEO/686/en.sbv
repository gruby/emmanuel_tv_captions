My name is Mr Odianaka Achumie.

0:00:04.220,0:00:09.460
I come from Anambra State, Nigeria.

0:00:09.460,0:00:20.080
This is my son Somtochukwu Achumie, my wife and my in-laws.

0:00:20.080,0:00:24.160
Praise the Lord.

0:00:24.160,0:00:30.440
I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life and that of my family.

0:00:30.440,0:00:36.040
First and foremost, I want to glorify the name of the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:36.040,0:00:41.220
for taking away shame and disgrace and the spirit of death from my family.

0:00:41.220,0:00:46.360
I can't wait to glorify your god too.

0:00:46.360,0:00:50.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:50.320,0:00:59.800
I can't wait to glorify your god but for now, it would be very hard for me to say, "I glorify your god".

0:00:59.800,0:01:03.020
As you embrace the Living God...

0:01:03.020,0:01:07.360
You are about to testify not about something God has done.

0:01:07.360,0:01:09.420
I want you to look inwards.

0:01:09.420,0:01:23.880
No matter how much you master the Scripture; without acting on it, without true obedience

0:01:23.880,0:01:36.300
to what you have read, you will remain spiritual babies.

0:01:36.300,0:01:50.260
Tell your neighbour, "No matter how much you master the Scripture; without acting on the Word,

0:01:50.260,0:02:03.060
without true obedience to what you read, you will remain a spiritual baby".

0:02:03.060,0:02:08.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:08.500,0:02:14.100
I want to let the world know that Prophet T.B. Joshua has a living God.

0:02:14.100,0:02:15.100
Praise the Lord!

0:02:15.100,0:02:16.860
[Hallelujah]

0:02:16.860,0:02:28.460
My testimony goes like this: Last month, February, my son called me from his school.

0:02:28.460,0:02:30.940
He is a boarding student.

0:02:30.940,0:02:33.620
He said that he was not feeling well.

0:02:33.620,0:02:36.820
I thought that it was just a minor case.

0:02:36.820,0:02:44.340
I then instructed him to contact the school authority so that they could give him medication, which he did.

0:02:44.340,0:02:46.620
After three days, he called me again.

0:02:46.620,0:02:48.260
I asked him what the problem was.

0:02:48.260,0:02:52.500
He told me that the sickness was still there.

0:02:52.500,0:02:56.460
I told him to prepare to come back home.

0:02:56.460,0:03:04.320
On coming back home, before my very eyes, he came into my room and lay on my bed.

0:03:04.320,0:03:07.340
I witnessed what he passed through.

0:03:07.340,0:03:15.380
Heavy fever, cold, many types of sickness at the same time, complaining about severe headaches,

0:03:15.380,0:03:21.860
that his eyes were closing, chest and stomach pains and hotness of the leg and body.

0:03:21.860,0:03:29.360
I asked what kind of sickness it was and went to the pharmacy to get drugs for him.

0:03:29.360,0:03:35.500
After giving him drugs, he said he would try and cope by himself.

0:03:35.500,0:03:36.960
I said, "OK".

0:03:36.960,0:03:44.920
About three days later, I asked him to go back to school and I gave him some medication to help him cope.

0:03:44.920,0:03:52.880
Back at school, two days later, he called me that the problem was still there.

0:03:52.880,0:03:54.800
I told him to start making his way back home.

0:03:54.800,0:04:01.040
That was on the 5th of March, on Saturday.

0:04:01.040,0:04:03.980
On that day, I was preparing to go somewhere.

0:04:03.980,0:04:10.940
I decided to suspend wherever I was going to come to The SCOAN

0:04:10.940,0:04:15.940
to tell my God what was happening in my son's life.

0:04:15.940,0:04:22.060
I decided to come to The SCOAN with my wife on the 5th.

0:04:22.060,0:04:34.800
Mainly, the purpose why I came was to fellowship with the Church, get the Morning Water and go back home.

0:04:34.800,0:04:39.540
Surprisingly, I saw my son that morning.

0:04:39.540,0:04:47.560
I told him to stay back home, while my wife and I go to Lagos and come back.

0:04:47.560,0:04:49.080
He agreed.

0:04:49.080,0:04:51.560
We came to The SCOAN.

0:04:51.560,0:04:57.460
After two days, we left for our destination – back to Anambra State.

0:04:57.460,0:05:10.060
I introduced the Morning Water to him and told him I knew that with the mercy of God

0:05:10.060,0:05:14.980
in Prophet T.B. Joshua, it would see him through, that he should prepare to go back to school.

0:05:14.980,0:05:19.100
I gave him a bottle of the Morning Water to go back to school with.

0:05:19.100,0:05:20.820
He said, "OK".

0:05:20.820,0:05:29.500
A few days later, he called me that he was coming back home, that the sickness was still there.

0:05:29.500,0:05:33.000
I asked him whether he had used the Morning Water.

0:05:33.000,0:05:35.480
He replied, "Yes".

0:05:35.480,0:05:36.700
I asked him how he had applied it.

0:05:36.700,0:05:42.980
He said when he ministered it to his body, it felt like it didn't touch him, so he opened the bottle and poured

0:05:42.980,0:05:46.300
all of it into his mouth.

0:05:46.300,0:05:55.080
After he poured the bottle of the Morning Water into his mouth, that was where the battle started.

0:05:55.080,0:05:59.560
He said immediately he poured all of the Morning Water inside his mouth,

0:05:59.560,0:06:04.980
it was like there was war inside his body – a heavy burning sensation.

0:06:04.980,0:06:11.120
Then, he decided to run back home because he felt like he was dying.

0:06:11.120,0:06:15.160
Before he had come home, I had already left for work.

0:06:15.160,0:06:20.000
He narrated everything to my wife.

0:06:20.000,0:06:24.780
Then, my wife called me, that my son was back home.

0:06:24.780,0:06:29.020
When I asked him what the matter was, he said, “Daddy, I am dying!”

0:06:29.020,0:06:37.620
I told my wife that I had the Morning Water in my cupboard, that she should take it and minister to him.

0:06:37.620,0:06:41.520
She said that the one he had ministered was burning him, seriously.

0:06:41.520,0:06:47.440
I said that I was sensing there was a battle, that she should do what I told her. She said, “OK”.

0:06:47.440,0:06:53.300
After everything, she said that he had demanded for tea but she was afraid to give him.

0:06:53.300,0:06:59.440
He asked her if it was the last food he would eat in the house before dying.

0:06:59.440,0:07:05.360
I told her that there was a battle going on, that she should use the Morning Water

0:07:05.360,0:07:11.520
and pour it inside the tea, minister it to him, pray and give him the tea to drink.

0:07:11.520,0:07:14.400
She complied with my instructions.

0:07:14.400,0:07:28.380
Immediately he drank that tea, he said, “Mummy, there is a problem.

0:07:28.380,0:07:32.940
Something from my stomach is now coming up to my chest. There is a problem”.

0:07:32.940,0:07:34.240
The mother asked what it was.

0:07:34.240,0:07:36.460
He said that he felt like vomiting.

0:07:36.460,0:07:41.760
Then, my wife said, “Vomit it out!”

0:07:41.760,0:07:46.400
She collected the Morning Water and ministered it to him again.

0:07:46.400,0:07:56.740
Immediately, he vomited.

0:07:56.740,0:08:09.040
Behold, what we saw were seven pins, right in my own bedroom.

0:08:09.040,0:08:11.180
He fainted.

0:08:11.180,0:08:16.840
Look at the pins.

0:08:16.840,0:08:19.380
Using mere Morning Water...

0:08:19.380,0:08:21.620
The question is - "How did these enter?"

0:08:21.620,0:08:23.720
By command.

0:08:23.720,0:08:28.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:28.680,0:08:39.260
This means that there is a sort of command in the Morning Water, depending on your faith.

0:08:39.260,0:08:43.440
If your faith is big, your command will be even bigger.

0:08:43.440,0:08:48.080
If your faith is little, the command will also be little.

0:08:48.080,0:08:53.200
What is here?

0:08:53.200,0:08:58.140
Command; we call it command, which is authority.

0:08:58.140,0:09:02.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:02.620,0:09:05.040
Look at the pins.

0:09:05.040,0:09:10.680
Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:09:10.680,0:09:15.540
Then, my wife ministered the Morning Water on him again, calling the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:09:15.540,0:09:17.160
“Please, help my son!”

0:09:17.160,0:09:20.340
He was breathing as if he was dying.

0:09:20.340,0:09:28.960
After some time, he calmed down and that was the end of the matter - to date, no more hotness of the body.

0:09:28.960,0:09:34.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:34.380,0:09:37.840
Come.

0:09:37.840,0:09:40.260
Boy, what is your name?

0:09:40.260,0:09:41.760
Somtochukwu

0:09:41.760,0:09:45.380
You know that you can lie to your dad and your mum, don't you?

0:09:45.380,0:09:46.640
Yes.

0:09:46.640,0:09:47.760
Can you lie to me?

0:09:47.760,0:09:48.700
No.

0:09:48.700,0:09:51.780
You know you are in a cult?

0:09:51.780,0:09:53.500
Yes.

0:09:53.500,0:09:56.020
Go and tell your mum and your dad.

0:09:56.020,0:10:03.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:03.760,0:10:06.760
Open up and be free finally.

0:10:06.760,0:10:12.280
He has to leave the school immediately and they have to look for another school.

0:10:12.280,0:10:16.460
Did you listen? He is not going back to that school, we have to look for another school.

0:10:16.460,0:10:19.220
I will join you people to look for the best school.

0:10:19.220,0:10:22.920
The school is good but because of...

0:10:22.920,0:10:24.940
We need to remove him from there.

0:10:24.940,0:10:29.120
OK. Tell us how you joined the secret cult.

0:10:29.120,0:10:33.920
My name is Somtochukwu Achumie Emmanuel.

0:10:33.920,0:10:37.260
How I joined the secret cult:

0:10:37.260,0:10:47.480
In JSS3, I met a boy who asked me to come and meet him in the hostel.

0:10:47.480,0:10:51.200
Later that night, I met the boy.

0:10:51.200,0:10:54.860
He said that I should escort him somewhere.

0:10:54.860,0:11:00.180
So, I escorted him somewhere in the bush.

0:11:00.180,0:11:09.480
I saw many boys there who started flogging me with knives and told me to lie down.

0:11:09.480,0:11:18.020
After flogging me, they initiated me using a razor and an egg in the bush.

0:11:18.020,0:11:23.560
After initiating me, from that day, I joined the secret cult.

0:11:23.560,0:11:28.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:28.140,0:11:35.020
Each pin represents their mission.

0:11:35.020,0:11:45.180
They were not given to him to be swallowed, but they entered him by command.

0:11:45.180,0:11:51.300
You, as a Christian, use the command by the power of God; they also use commands.

0:11:51.300,0:11:57.960
The Bible says, "We are not fighting the flesh and blood, but spirit beings".

0:11:57.960,0:12:01.540
Powers of principalities.

0:12:01.540,0:12:06.960
These pins entered by command.

0:12:06.960,0:12:13.820
They were not vomited like they said: The pins came out by command.

0:12:13.820,0:12:17.260
That Morning Water - don't play with it.

0:12:17.260,0:12:22.400
Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:12:22.400,0:12:31.800
Those pins became physical pins at the time they were coming out.

0:12:31.800,0:12:37.940
Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:12:37.940,0:12:41.200
So, they flogged you?

0:12:41.200,0:12:43.500
Yes.

0:12:43.500,0:12:46.980
What is the name of your cult?

0:12:46.980,0:12:48.120
Arobaga.

0:12:48.120,0:12:52.260
OK. It's all right. Forget about that.

0:12:52.260,0:12:55.040
Did you listen to that? This is the name.

0:12:55.040,0:12:58.100
Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:12:58.100,0:13:01.520
In which class are you?

0:13:01.520,0:13:02.760
SS1, sir.

0:13:02.760,0:13:04.840
SS1.

0:13:04.840,0:13:06.560
Can you see your children at home?

0:13:06.560,0:13:11.440
SS1 - the first section of the secondary school.

0:13:11.440,0:13:18.480
If this could happen in SS1, the beginners - so definitely your school, your students, your children...

0:13:18.480,0:13:19.920
We need prayer...

0:13:19.920,0:13:23.300
Our future.

0:13:23.300,0:13:27.460
Did you know when those pins entered you?

0:13:27.460,0:13:28.480
No, sir.

0:13:28.480,0:13:32.980
But you were given something like blood?

0:13:32.980,0:13:33.800
Yes, sir.

0:13:33.800,0:13:35.140
Thank you.

0:13:35.140,0:13:38.780
Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:13:38.780,0:13:43.800
Let me just assure the father and mother; there is no problem.

0:13:43.800,0:13:48.100
Please, I want to assure you; no problem. OK?

0:13:48.100,0:13:49.800
There is nothing to be afraid of.

0:13:49.800,0:13:51.860
What we need to do now...

0:13:51.860,0:13:54.020
Look; listen, mamma.

0:13:54.020,0:13:55.460
Do you know what we need to do now?

0:13:55.460,0:13:56.080
Yes, sir.

0:13:56.080,0:13:58.340
Immediately after the service - wait for me.

0:13:58.340,0:14:00.520
He will not go back to that school.

0:14:00.520,0:14:01.960
We will look for another school.

0:14:01.960,0:14:03.840
We will ask God for direction.

0:14:03.840,0:14:05.500
Right now - he is free.

0:14:05.500,0:14:07.820
Amen!

0:14:07.820,0:14:10.260
God bless you, sir.

0:14:10.260,0:14:17.260
Assume that this revelation about him being in a cult did not come, and he is just being delivered,

0:14:17.260,0:14:25.100
he would still belong to the association and only the poison given to him would be removed.

0:14:25.100,0:14:28.980
But we have removed him from the association because of the revelation.

0:14:28.980,0:14:31.700
Amen.

0:14:31.700,0:14:35.800
Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony

0:14:35.800,0:14:37.500
It's all right.

0:14:37.500,0:14:39.700
Did you suspect anything like that?

0:14:39.700,0:14:44.600
I didn't suspect it, man of God.

0:14:44.600,0:14:46.420
No. Let your husband speak.

0:14:46.420,0:14:48.700
Did you suspect it before?

0:14:48.700,0:14:49.520
No, sir.

0:14:49.520,0:14:52.820
I have been telling him not to join anything like a secret cult.

0:14:52.820,0:14:54.360
He assured me that he would never do that.

0:14:54.360,0:14:57.440
Why did you tell the little boy not to join the cult?

0:14:57.440,0:14:58.700
Because at his age...

0:14:58.700,0:15:00.160
You might have seen something.

0:15:00.160,0:15:01.680
Listen.

0:15:01.680,0:15:08.240
If you are telling your son, who is in the secondary school, not to join a secret cult,

0:15:08.240,0:15:12.340
you might have seen some traces in his character, or attitude.

0:15:12.340,0:15:18.580
It is too early to tell a secondary school boy not to join a secret cult.

0:15:18.580,0:15:19.360
Why?

0:15:19.360,0:15:20.500
Please, open up.

0:15:20.500,0:15:25.720
Don't worry. Just tell us everything.

0:15:25.720,0:15:27.340
It is too early.

0:15:27.340,0:15:29.940
If he were at the university...

0:15:29.940,0:15:35.360
Even at the university, if you know what kind of person your son or daughter is,

0:15:35.360,0:15:39.500
you would not even mention that to them.

0:15:39.500,0:15:47.140
Telling your little son at secondary school not to join a secret cult - it is too early.

0:15:47.140,0:15:51.700
And that language is to be for...

0:15:51.700,0:15:59.180
Were you suspecting because of the character, an attitude or what you have seen to say that kind of thing?

0:15:59.180,0:16:07.780
Sir, in the environment where I was living before, almost all youths at his age are occultists.

0:16:07.780,0:16:12.780
That was why I instructed him not to join those boys.

0:16:12.780,0:16:19.400
That also motivated me to move to a different area - very far from there.

0:16:19.400,0:16:20.080
OK.

0:16:20.080,0:16:22.120
We are clear now.

0:16:22.120,0:16:27.880
It was because of the things you saw in the environment you were living in.

0:16:27.880,0:16:29.240
Thank you.

0:16:29.240,0:16:42.520
Apart from that, have you ever suspected this boy because of his attitude or character?

0:16:42.520,0:16:45.420
Have you seen anything strange?

0:16:45.420,0:16:46.260
No, sir.

0:16:46.260,0:16:48.540
I was even shocked when he confirmed.

0:16:48.540,0:16:50.580
Stand up.

0:16:50.580,0:16:54.160
Do you know the reason why I asked you to stand up?

0:16:54.160,0:16:57.980
Trust yourself and God.

0:16:57.980,0:17:09.380
Those of you who are ready to die because of your children; when you see "hell", you will not trust anybody.

0:17:09.380,0:17:11.960
Some of you here are ready to die because of your children.

0:17:11.960,0:17:14.060
You trust them to any length.

0:17:14.060,0:17:17.020
While even you yourself, you do not trust yourself.

0:17:17.020,0:17:21.060
Ask your neighbour, "Do you trust yourself?"

0:17:21.060,0:17:27.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:27.860,0:17:30.140
You don't trust yourself.

0:17:30.140,0:17:32.520
If you trusted yourself, you would know who you are.

0:17:32.520,0:17:35.260
You don't know who you are.

0:17:35.260,0:17:41.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:41.200,0:17:47.120
Love everyone and trust only God.

0:17:47.120,0:17:49.840
You don't trust yourself and you say that you trust someone.

0:17:49.840,0:17:51.440
You say you trust your children...

0:17:51.440,0:17:52.580
Look at this man.

0:17:52.580,0:17:54.340
It is not his fault.

0:17:54.340,0:17:58.700
He said he was shocked when the boy answered "Yes" to the man of God saying,

0:17:58.700,0:18:00.840
"Do you know that you are in a cult?"

0:18:00.840,0:18:04.560
He was expecting his son to say, "I don't know what the meaning of cult is".

0:18:04.560,0:18:07.720
When the boy said that he was in a cult, the father was surprised.

0:18:07.720,0:18:13.700
Please, learn to trust only God and love everyone.

0:18:13.700,0:18:15.560
Leave the word "trust" to God.

0:18:15.560,0:18:19.560
Tell your neighbour, "Leave the word 'trust'"

0:18:19.560,0:18:20.420
To whom?

0:18:20.420,0:18:21.260
[To God]

0:18:21.260,0:18:22.120
I cannot hear you.

0:18:22.120,0:18:24.360
[Leave the word "trust" to God.]

0:18:24.360,0:18:25.560
I cannot hear you.

0:18:25.560,0:18:27.420
[Leave the word "trust" to God.]

0:18:27.420,0:18:34.020
As of today, leave the word "trust" to only God.

0:18:34.020,0:18:35.820
Love everyone.

0:18:35.820,0:18:37.580
You may be seated.

STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:18:50.540,0:18:53.920
My name is Mr Odinaka Achumie.

0:18:53.920,0:18:56.560
Next to me is my wife.

0:18:56.560,0:18:58.320
We come from Anambra State, Nigeria.

0:18:58.320,0:19:07.920
God used this ministry to deliver my son, Somtochukwu Achumie, from evil attacks, through vomiting pins.

0:19:07.920,0:19:15.940
He also delivered him from the spirit of death that was in my family.

0:19:15.940,0:19:22.220
Ever since my son was delivered, there has been a big difference in his life.

0:19:22.220,0:19:26.460
If you saw him now, you would not recognise him anymore because he is now very healthy.

0:19:26.460,0:19:34.360
I want to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua whom God used mightily to deliver my family

0:19:34.360,0:19:38.180
and put away shame completely from my family.

0:19:38.180,0:19:42.620
Without the help of God, it would have been a different story altogether.

0:19:42.620,0:19:49.040
But glory be to God for making it possible that I would be among persons who would partake

0:19:49.040,0:19:51.660
in the blessings of this ministry.

0:19:51.660,0:19:53.120
Amen. To God be the glory.

0:19:53.120,0:19:56.240
And truly better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.

0:19:56.240,0:20:03.220
In this fashion, Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners count it a privilege to be able to support

0:20:03.220,0:20:05.560
your family to send your son to school.

0:20:05.560,0:20:09.420
In this case, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners are presenting you

0:20:09.420,0:20:14.040
with a scholarship of 150,000 naira for your son.

0:20:14.040,0:20:16.040
You can take out the money.

0:20:16.040,0:20:21.840
T.B. Joshua Supports Mr & Mrs Achumie With A Scholarship Of N150,000 For Their Son

0:20:21.840,0:20:25.560
First of all, I want to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:25.560,0:20:33.140
I also thank the man of God for his mercy and kindness, most especially towards my family.

0:20:33.140,0:20:41.700
It is very surprising to me but I know that it is God who is doing it through him.

0:20:41.700,0:20:45.320
May God bless him, keep him, give him long life and sound health

0:20:45.320,0:20:48.060
so that he will be alive to do more for others.

0:20:48.060,0:20:57.660
It is not possible to be delivered and receive a scholarship in one place.

0:20:57.660,0:20:59.220
This is the only place where I have seen such a thing.

0:20:59.220,0:21:01.540
I did not pay a dime.

0:21:01.540,0:21:03.880
I did not even pay one naira.

0:21:03.880,0:21:07.320
Since we came here, the man of God has been taking care of us.

0:21:07.320,0:21:10.580
He provided us with accommodation and feeding all this time.

0:21:10.580,0:21:13.160
In fact, we lived like kings.

0:21:13.160,0:21:18.000
He did a lot for us, what we never even expected.

0:21:18.000,0:21:19.200
To God be the glory.

0:21:19.200,0:21:20.400
We thank God Almighty for your life.

0:21:20.400,0:21:24.840
Truly, a million thanks are not enough for what Jesus Christ has given us today.

0:21:24.840,0:21:29.680
My husband has said it all but I want to thank the God of T.B. Joshua.

0:21:29.680,0:21:40.000
I want to thank Jesus Christ who made it possible for me today to be a happy woman in this world

0:21:40.000,0:21:48.280
because satan came to steal from my house and family but the God of T.B. Joshua said, “No”.

0:21:48.280,0:21:54.560
The God of T.B. Joshua delivered my son and gave him a scholarship of N150,000.

0:21:54.560,0:21:57.900
I want to return all the glory to God.

0:21:57.900,0:22:05.300
I want to pray for Prophet T.B. Joshua that God would give him long life and lift him up.

0:22:05.300,0:22:08.560
I wish him Heaven at last.

0:22:08.560,0:22:13.600
I want to say, "Thank You, Jesus for what You have done in my family!"

0:22:13.600,0:22:16.720
I don’t know what to say; I am short of words.

0:22:16.720,0:22:20.040
But I want to say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:22:20.040,0:22:22.740
God of T.B. Joshua, I worship You.

0:22:22.740,0:22:24.440
I thank You, Lord, in Jesus’ name.

0:22:24.440,0:22:25.620
Amen.

0:22:25.620,0:22:27.020
To God be the glory.

0:22:27.020,0:22:31.280
We have no natural words to describe this kind of joy you are feeling right now, except to say,

0:22:31.280,0:22:33.180
"Thank You, Jesus Christ".

0:22:33.180,0:22:36.620
We encourage you; you are blessed and you are delivered by the Word of God.

0:22:36.620,0:22:40.880
Make God's Word the standard for your life and His rule your principle and you will see that for you

0:22:40.880,0:22:45.720
and your family better is truly not good enough - the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:22:45.720,0:22:47.300
Amen.

0:22:47.300,0:22:48.780
Thank You, Jesus!
