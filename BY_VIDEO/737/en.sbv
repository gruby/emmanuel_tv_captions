0:00:00.020,0:00:04.240
God's undisputable and incontestable power is being demonstrated

0:00:04.240,0:00:11.700
as the morning water is ministered by the evangelists sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.

0:00:11.740,0:00:16.260
As satanic forces tremble at the mention of the name of Jesus Christ,

0:00:16.280,0:00:19.600
the demons confess their evil activities.

0:00:19.660,0:00:24.900
Watch and see what happened when light met darkness in the life of this woman.

0:00:24.960,0:00:30.800
Fire all over your body! Fire! Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:30.820,0:00:32.800
Speak out! Who are you?

0:00:32.840,0:00:35.600
Ministration Of The Morning Water in Jesus' Name

0:00:35.680,0:00:39.500
Who are you?

0:00:39.520,0:00:41.100
Who are you in this body?

0:00:41.140,0:00:43.500
We are the marine goddess.

0:00:43.560,0:00:47.400
How many of you are inside this body?

0:00:47.400,0:00:49.000
We are two billion.

0:00:49.000,0:00:50.900
Ministration Of The Morning Water In Jesus' Name

0:00:50.960,0:00:52.300
Who else?

0:00:52.380,0:00:53.400
Python.

0:00:53.400,0:00:54.700
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:54.780,0:01:00.600
So, you say you are python. Fire!

0:01:00.660,0:01:02.900
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:02.960,0:01:04.700
What have you done to her, you demon?

0:01:04.780,0:01:14.200
I slept with the family and they used her to do a sacrifice.

0:01:14.220,0:01:23.300
We initiated her but that is the same girl who called on the Most High God.

0:01:23.300,0:01:24.500
What have you done to her career?

0:01:24.500,0:01:30.400
He wants to equip her with power and strength but we don't agree.

0:01:30.400,0:01:36.800
We came to fight her with two billion serpents.

0:01:36.860,0:01:40.200
How do you destroy them - her family?

0:01:40.200,0:01:42.200
I kill them like chicken!

0:01:42.240,0:01:43.700
You kill them like chicken?

0:01:43.700,0:01:44.500
Yes.

0:01:44.560,0:01:46.800
How? Explain. How do you operate?

0:01:46.800,0:01:53.880
I kill them. They have sinned against me, so I kill them.

0:01:53.880,0:01:56.100
How many of them have you killed?

0:01:56.140,0:02:01.800
Uncountable. She doesn't know her mother. I killed her father too.

0:02:01.880,0:02:03.300
You killed the mother and the father?

0:02:03.300,0:02:08.300
I killed all of the family; she doesn't know them.

0:02:08.300,0:02:10.600
She was running away from my kingdom.

0:02:10.620,0:02:12.700
Who are you that is killing them?

0:02:12.700,0:02:17.000
I am Korle.

0:02:17.040,0:02:18.600
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:02:18.680,0:02:21.300
What have you done to her career?

0:02:21.360,0:02:33.600
She's very brilliant but we don't want her to succeed because of Divine strength and power.

0:02:33.660,0:02:37.900
Why don't you want her succeed?

0:02:37.980,0:02:41.700
Because she is our sacrificial lamb.

0:02:41.740,0:02:43.200
Sacrificial lamb?

0:02:43.240,0:02:45.600
Yes.

0:02:45.640,0:02:54.700
They have used her to atone for the sin committed by her great-great-grandparents.

0:02:54.740,0:02:56.100
They dedicated her to you?

0:02:56.140,0:02:58.300
Yes!

0:02:58.380,0:02:59.700
What else have you done to her?

0:02:59.700,0:03:08.300
We caused her to sleep with people, so that we can gain more people in our marine kingdom.

0:03:08.360,0:03:10.000
You cause her to sleep with people?

0:03:10.020,0:03:12.200
Yes.

0:03:12.260,0:03:16.700
How? Explain, you demon! How do you operate? How do you use her?

0:03:16.720,0:03:23.500
Be very careful with me! Do you understand?

0:03:23.500,0:03:31.800
Speak out! How do you use her?

0:03:31.800,0:03:36.100
We entered her and we entered the man too.

0:03:36.160,0:03:38.100
You entered her and the man too?

0:03:38.160,0:03:42.900
It's so that we can get the souls in our kingdom.

0:03:42.940,0:03:48.300
What else have you done to her?

0:03:48.360,0:03:57.500
We killed her but your master created another body within her.

0:03:57.580,0:03:58.500
You killed her?

0:03:58.500,0:03:59.500
Yes.

0:03:59.580,0:04:04.000
We cut her heart but your master sewed it.

0:04:04.000,0:04:11.600
We even bombed and shot her but she didn't die.

0:04:11.640,0:04:17.100
That's why we entered her with two billion snakes

0:04:17.160,0:04:25.600
so that we can tie her down before the two queens.

0:04:25.660,0:04:27.900
How long have you been in this body, you demon?

0:04:27.980,0:04:30.400
Since childhood.

0:04:30.420,0:04:35.200
She flies like a vulture, like an eagle.

0:04:35.240,0:04:36.900
You fly like an eagle?

0:04:36.960,0:04:40.100
Yes, because she's a warrior.

0:04:40.140,0:04:42.000
When you fly, what happens? What do you do?

0:04:42.080,0:04:53.800
We fight in the dark clouds; we are the agents of the dark clouds.

0:04:53.840,0:05:05.400
Look, when rain wanted to fall, it did not because the cloud was very dark.

0:05:05.440,0:05:16.400
We used someone to block the cloud but she stood and prayed and the barrier was broken.

0:05:16.460,0:05:24.300
Now, the rain is falling. The time has come but we have come to fight.

0:05:24.300,0:05:27.600
Ok. Right now it is time for you to go in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:05:27.660,0:05:34.100
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body! In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!

0:05:34.160,0:05:39.300
In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!

0:05:39.380,0:05:42.700
Your ring, your crown. Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:42.740,0:05:48.300
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Take your ring, your crown! All over your body! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:48.360,0:05:56.900
Fire! All over your body in the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ!

0:05:56.900,0:06:01.000
There's no hiding place for you demon! Fire!

0:06:01.060,0:06:06.700
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body! Fire! Your ring, your crown, your head!

0:06:06.720,0:06:11.900
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Wherever that power is located! Fire!

0:06:11.900,0:06:17.340
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Fire! There's no hiding place for you demon!

0:06:17.340,0:06:22.600
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:22.660,0:06:32.500
All over your body! Your head! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:32.540,0:06:38.400
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:38.440,0:06:46.700
There's no hiding place for you! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:46.700,0:06:53.700
All over your body! Wherever that power is located! In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!

0:06:53.720,0:07:01.100
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body! Your head, your toes! Take your rings, your crown!

0:07:01.140,0:07:09.700
Fire! You python! You demon! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:09.700,0:07:13.980
Your ring, your crown! Take them off! In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:13.980,0:07:21.300
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Out, in Jesus' name!

0:07:21.320,0:07:23.200
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:23.200,0:07:26.100
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:07:26.180,0:07:31.600
In Jesus' name! You are declared free in Jesus' name!

0:07:31.600,0:07:45.200
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:07:45.240,0:07:50.500
Give thanks to God.

0:07:50.520,0:07:55.000
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:07:55.040,0:08:02.300
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:02.380,0:08:06.200
Indeed God is with us.

0:08:06.260,0:08:15.900
My name is Mary Penuku Nenyo. I come from Ghana - the Volta region.

0:08:15.960,0:08:28.000
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was in bondage - serious bondage.

0:08:28.040,0:08:37.100
Because of Christ, I was transferred from the kingdom of darkness to His marvellous light.

0:08:37.140,0:08:43.900
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:08:43.960,0:08:50.100
My testimony goes like this.

0:08:50.140,0:09:03.100
My parents had their origin from Bakpa, Awaduwe.

0:09:03.180,0:09:10.200
They travelled to Ivory Coast and stayed there for fishing.

0:09:10.260,0:09:14.500
During that time, I was born to them.

0:09:14.580,0:09:24.200
Then, a message came to them one day that my family needed me

0:09:24.200,0:09:28.300
and that they should release me to them

0:09:28.360,0:09:36.100
to atone for the sin committed by my great-great-grandfather.

0:09:36.160,0:09:42.440
They told my family that there were serious deaths in the family because

0:09:42.440,0:09:48.100
my great-great-grandfather had sinned against the God, Korle,

0:09:48.120,0:09:54.000
which resulted in a curse in my family.

0:09:54.060,0:10:02.900
So, they said the gods had appointed me and that I was the only one they could send to him

0:10:02.920,0:10:09.600
to atone for the sin committed by my great-great-grandfather.

0:10:09.640,0:10:15.200
So, explain to us what it was you were told that your great-great-grandfather actually committed.

0:10:15.240,0:10:26.800
They said that my great-great-grandfather had slept with a 'Trokosi', an outcast.

0:10:26.820,0:10:37.500
My great-great-grandfather slept with an outcast, which resulted in a curse in the family.

0:10:37.520,0:10:44.500
In a week, up to ten or five people could die in my family.

0:10:44.560,0:10:53.800
They had gone to ask the oracle, Korle, and it said it was the one killing the people in my family.

0:10:53.820,0:11:01.000
So, it said it needed a maiden virgin girl - a baby girl for a sacrifice.

0:11:01.060,0:11:10.700
Because of fear, anxiety and trauma in the family, they took me from my mother

0:11:10.760,0:11:15.500
to go and atone for the sin.

0:11:15.580,0:11:27.000
It happened that my mother couldn't carry the burden. So, it was my father who brought me

0:11:27.060,0:11:30.300
to my hometown in Ghana.

0:11:30.380,0:11:45.800
Then, they bought hoes, cutlasses, clothes and beads like for someone who was getting married -

0:11:45.840,0:11:49.000
a bride.

0:11:49.060,0:11:58.700
They took me to Mamfi Ougame (Korle's shrine) for the atonement.

0:11:58.740,0:12:15.600
In an initiation rite, they took me to the riverside and initiated me on a journey of no return.

0:12:15.600,0:12:20.700
A journey of no return.

0:12:20.780,0:12:30.200
Then, public humiliation was organised - they needed to humiliate me in public.

0:12:30.220,0:12:35.600
So, I was humiliated - my clothes were stripped.

0:12:35.600,0:12:42.900
They tore them and my hair was shaved.

0:12:42.920,0:12:56.200
I was then introduced to an old priest as my husband together with other maidens.

0:12:56.220,0:13:03.900
So, you mean to say, sister, that as a very young girl ... just give us an idea of your age at this period

0:13:03.900,0:13:09.800
when you were taken and given as a sacrifice to this shrine.

0:13:09.820,0:13:15.440
I can't actually recollect my age but I was very young.

0:13:15.440,0:13:18.600
We had seniors. It was like a system.

0:13:18.600,0:13:29.600
So, they told me that I was one year old when they took me to the shrine.

0:13:29.640,0:13:38.000
This was how I was humiliated. I endured public humiliation.

0:13:38.000,0:13:40.700
They humiliate you.

0:13:40.700,0:13:47.300
The work we do in the Trokosi system:

0:13:47.360,0:13:56.200
We had seniors and I was a junior - very young. They gave me a name 'Mamavi'.

0:13:56.240,0:14:05.100
That means, 'Small Trokosi girl, small outcast'.

0:14:05.160,0:14:14.100
As my job, I had to kneel down and pray to the oracle,

0:14:14.120,0:14:23.540
"Let somebody sin so we can get more people in our kingdom".

0:14:23.540,0:14:24.840
I had to beg

0:14:24.840,0:14:30.300
because there were seniors, and they had to come so that another person would come after me

0:14:30.360,0:14:33.200
so that I too would become a senior.

0:14:33.200,0:14:44.880
In my case, I prayed in my language, 'Evineva lo', which means, 'Let somebody come'

0:14:44.880,0:14:48.100
because I was tired.

0:14:48.140,0:15:01.900
But, in my case, nobody was coming.

0:15:01.900,0:15:12.100
Another thing we also did - the priest would just point at you -

0:15:12.180,0:15:17.600
he could call us chicken, goat or cow because we were cows to him;

0:15:17.640,0:15:23.600
then, he would call us and sleep with us just like that.

0:15:23.620,0:15:28.040
You are talking as if there are many young ladies like yourself in that shrine.

0:15:28.040,0:15:32.600
Can you tell us how many people were in this slavery, in this shrine.

0:15:32.620,0:15:39.800
We were about 500 in that shrine where they kept me - Korle shrine.

0:15:39.800,0:15:45.300
There were other shrines but ours was the headquarters.

0:15:45.340,0:15:51.260
And all of these girls - you mean to say that a very elderly man, a priest, a chief priest

0:15:51.260,0:15:55.500
was actually sleeping with all these young ladies as a ritual.

0:15:55.540,0:15:57.400
Yes.

0:15:57.460,0:16:05.400
He would point at you, 'Goat, chicken, cow - line up!' And he would sleep with you.

0:16:05.400,0:16:11.600
On top of it, when he slept with you and you got pregnant and gave birth,

0:16:11.600,0:16:16.240
you had to take care of the child alone.

0:16:16.260,0:16:22.200
They wouldn't help you but the child belonged to them.

0:16:22.220,0:16:30.700
Another task given to us was to bring hoes and cutlasses to the shrine to farm

0:16:30.720,0:16:34.000
for the priests.

0:16:34.080,0:16:47.800
As a junior - they gathered all the 5,000, their hoes, cutlasses, and the farmland was very far -

0:16:47.800,0:16:51.000
I had to carry them for my seniors.

0:16:51.060,0:16:59.900
When we crossed the river, sometimes I would fall inside.

0:16:59.980,0:17:04.920
Nobody else was coming. They said I had brought another spirit to the shrine.

0:17:04.980,0:17:09.320
You were talking about the work you were doing in the shrine

0:17:09.320,0:17:14.080
as someone that had been dedicated to these gods right from the age of one years old.

0:17:14.080,0:17:22.400
You were also mentioning about preparing charms for people. Can you explain more about this.

0:17:22.460,0:17:29.300
In the system, people would come.

0:17:29.380,0:17:33.600
Since I had not attained my puberty rights,

0:17:33.600,0:17:41.800
I was the one - being a junior - to prepare charms for people.

0:17:41.880,0:17:52.340
Armed robbers would come. I would prepare charms for them so that when they got shot,

0:17:52.340,0:18:03.200
they would not die, and even if they got cut, it would not penetrate.

0:18:03.260,0:18:06.600
My assignment was to prepare charms.

0:18:06.680,0:18:11.620
The more charms I prepared, the more evil spirits entered me.

0:18:17.240,0:18:34.800
When the priest finally died, I was accused of bringing a different spirit; that I was an evil child.

0:18:34.860,0:18:36.100
I didn't say anything.

0:18:39.860,0:18:44.400
When the priest died, I was very young

0:18:44.400,0:18:53.400
but since he was my husband, I had to perform widowhood rites.

0:18:53.420,0:18:59.800
The widowhood rites continued. They had to shave my head.

0:18:59.800,0:19:07.600
I was confined to a room and had to stay there for six days without water and food.

0:19:07.640,0:19:14.700
On the third day, I could not continue with the hunger and thirst, and I collapsed.

0:19:14.720,0:19:20.100
But with God on my side, I revived. I continued the rituals.

0:19:20.120,0:19:26.000
After six months, they cleansed us from the widowhood rites.

0:19:26.020,0:19:35.700
Then, life continued like that and every day, we were performing our duties.

0:19:35.780,0:19:40.740
I was very stubborn. I would move around.

0:19:40.740,0:19:46.020
They had warned us not to go out and that if they caught anyone going out,

0:19:46.020,0:19:50.700
the person would be severly punished.

0:19:50.740,0:19:56.700
But for me, that wouldn't enter my head because I needed food to eat.

0:19:56.700,0:19:59.300
I needed food at all costs.

0:19:59.360,0:20:06.100
I would sneak out to go to churches and other places to hide.

0:20:06.160,0:20:09.720
Sometimes other children would be following me, 'Hey, Mamavi!'

0:20:09.720,0:20:13.300
because they had never seen such before - we were naked.

0:20:13.380,0:20:17.200
I didn't mind them because I needed food.

0:20:17.260,0:20:24.940
One time, I went out as usual to ask for food from people.

0:20:24.940,0:20:31.700
Some tourists came to one of the villages to snap photos.

0:20:31.700,0:20:37.700
They saw me, and it was strange to them. So they told me to stop.

0:20:37.780,0:20:40.620
In the shrine, they had warned us not to talk about it,

0:20:40.620,0:20:46.300
saying that if we would ever talk about it, our families would be destroyed and we would die.

0:20:46.320,0:20:49.200
I would tell them that I didn't want that but behind their back I would say, 'Let it happen'

0:20:49.200,0:20:52.700
because I didn't like this kind of lifestyle.

0:20:52.740,0:20:58.100
The tourists met me and snapped this photograph of me.

0:20:58.140,0:21:04.000
They asked me why I was in that condition, and I explained everything to them.

0:21:04.000,0:21:10.440
Six months later, they came back again and negotiated with the shrine owners

0:21:10.440,0:21:17.600
saying that their system was very barbaric and inhumane.

0:21:17.660,0:21:24.200
They told them that they had captured young girls and kept them just to use them,

0:21:24.280,0:21:25.900
which was not good.

0:21:25.940,0:21:34.020
They came to an agreement to liberate us. They paid a huge amount -

0:21:34.020,0:21:36.400
six million Cedis (Ghanaian currency) and a cow.

0:21:36.420,0:21:41.900
The foreigners were able to pay the money and the cow.

0:21:41.900,0:21:51.400
At first, they didn't agree to collect the amount because they asked whether the cow was for them to sleep with.

0:21:51.480,0:21:58.100
Later, they agreed and finally, they liberated us.

0:21:58.100,0:22:01.260
So, just to understand what you are saying, sister.

0:22:01.260,0:22:04.620
One time when you had actually escaped from the shrine, looking for food,

0:22:04.620,0:22:06.600
you met some foreigners who were tourists

0:22:06.600,0:22:11.600
who actually took a picture of you, and you explained the circumstances that you were in.

0:22:11.600,0:22:16.900
Several months later, the same foreigners actually came with another organisation

0:22:16.920,0:22:20.400
and actually bargained with the head of that shrine

0:22:20.400,0:22:24.840
and agreed to an exchange of money and also some other items

0:22:24.840,0:22:29.400
to release yourself and the other girls that were in captivity in that shrine.

0:22:29.400,0:22:32.100
Now, how old were you at this point?

0:22:32.180,0:22:34.600
I was eight years old.

0:22:34.600,0:22:37.120
So, you have been in that shrine your whole life.

0:22:37.120,0:22:40.500
As long as you can remember, you were living and brought up in that shrine?

0:22:40.520,0:22:41.600
Yes.

0:22:41.680,0:22:44.620
And you mean to say that the picture we are seeing here,

0:22:44.620,0:22:49.600
was the picture that was taken by these foreign tourists who met you in that condition?

0:22:49.620,0:22:50.700
Yes.

0:22:50.760,0:22:52.100
Ok.

0:22:52.140,0:22:59.800
After our liberation, the liberation brought about another problem.

0:22:59.880,0:23:05.100
I didn't know where to go to because I couldn't remember my village or where I came from.

0:23:05.180,0:23:13.820
So, there was an elderly woman, an inmate, who took interest in me and took care of me.

0:23:13.820,0:23:19.600
She was the one who told me the story about myself, which I told earlier.

0:23:19.680,0:23:30.500
She said she knew where I came from - an island called Awaduwe.

0:23:30.500,0:23:38.500
She showed me where I was from, and I traced my family house.

0:23:38.560,0:23:45.400
When I went there, they told me I couldn't enter.

0:23:45.440,0:23:52.000
They said if I entered the house, I may bring the curse back to them.

0:23:52.020,0:23:57.700
So, I was banished again from my family.

0:23:57.720,0:24:06.800
I had nowhere to go to. So, I had to return back to the shrine, to stay there alone.

0:24:06.860,0:24:11.180
So, at the age of eight, you actually found where your family was living

0:24:11.180,0:24:15.500
but they banished and rejected you again.

0:24:15.580,0:24:23.300
Yes, they rejected me, saying that if they welcomed me back to the family,

0:24:23.360,0:24:26.100
I might bring the curse back to them.

0:24:26.160,0:24:31.960
They had actually used me as a sacrifice. So, if they welcomed me,

0:24:31.960,0:24:34.060
I might bring the curse back to them.

0:24:34.060,0:24:38.600
So, I was driven out of the town.

0:24:38.640,0:24:42.400
So, I went back. I had nowhere else to go to.

0:24:42.460,0:24:49.000
I went back to stay in the shrine alone.

0:24:49.000,0:24:51.700
Life continued there.

0:24:51.740,0:24:54.180
I had to fend for myself.

0:24:54.180,0:24:57.100
I would go and pluck mangoes.

0:24:57.120,0:25:03.600
When people burned their charcoals, I would go and pick some and sell

0:25:03.600,0:25:06.900
in order to take care of myself.

0:25:06.900,0:25:10.900
I stayed alone for about three years.

0:25:10.980,0:25:20.500
One day when I was selling, an NGO, 'International Needs Organisation', saw me.

0:25:20.500,0:25:28.500
They told me, "Mamavi, we have liberated you. Why are you still here?"

0:25:28.540,0:25:34.200
Then I told her the other side of my story.

0:25:34.200,0:25:42.200
After our liberation, they gave training to the older ones.

0:25:42.220,0:25:46.100
While others were given money to settle down with.

0:25:46.100,0:25:51.020
Some were trained to do handicraft.

0:25:51.020,0:25:57.400
As for me, being at that tender age and my family didn't even want me -

0:25:57.480,0:26:03.200
if you gave them that kind of money, they may collect it but they wouldn't take care of me.

0:26:03.200,0:26:06.900
I said they should keep the money and use it to take care of me

0:26:06.900,0:26:12.500
and help me to go to school to the level I wanted.

0:26:12.540,0:26:20.300
When I was in the shrine, I loved school because I saw how school children dressed up nicely

0:26:20.380,0:26:22.400
to go to school.

0:26:22.400,0:26:32.600
I liked it. So, when they went to school like that, I would go and hide under the teacher's table

0:26:32.660,0:26:38.040
so that I could learn because if the other children saw me, they would be hooting at me,

0:26:38.040,0:26:40.800
calling me 'Mamavi' because of the way I dressed.

0:26:40.880,0:26:48.500
So, I would hide under the teacher's table, and the teacher liked me.

0:26:48.520,0:26:51.960
I would go under to see what they were writing.

0:26:51.960,0:26:56.300
I would also draw a line and write, 'A B C 1 2 3'.

0:26:56.340,0:27:05.300
That time, I knew how to spell, 'Standing, sitting, eating, pulling, pushing' and all that.

0:27:05.360,0:27:09.300
So, you mean to say, sister, that you were brought up not wearing any clothes.

0:27:09.300,0:27:15.000
You were brought up living naked, moving around naked. That is how you were actually brought up?

0:27:15.060,0:27:15.560
Yes.

0:27:18.940,0:27:24.600
The foreigners took me and said that since I had chosen education, they would educate me.

0:27:24.660,0:27:35.500
They handed me over to some people who paid my school fees,

0:27:35.540,0:27:39.800
bought books and other things for me.

0:27:39.880,0:27:47.600
God saw me through, and I was able to complete Senior Seconary School

0:27:47.600,0:27:54.300
with the help of I.N. (NGO).

0:27:54.320,0:28:01.200
After my education, problems and challenges started

0:28:01.240,0:28:08.100
between the woman I was staying with and I.N. (NGO).

0:28:08.180,0:28:14.100
The woman kicked me out. So, I had to go.

0:28:14.140,0:28:25.000
After I was kicked out of the village, I was introduced to an old relative in Aflao (Ghana).

0:28:25.060,0:28:30.000
Since I had been kicked out, I had to go there and stay with her.

0:28:30.800,0:28:34.200
That was like going from the frying pan to fire.

0:28:34.200,0:28:36.700
That was when the suffering started.

0:28:36.720,0:28:39.940
But before you go ahead, sister, just to understand what you are saying.

0:28:39.940,0:28:44.800
Even though you had physically left this shrine and people were trying to help you

0:28:44.800,0:28:49.780
go through education, because those evil spirits were still inside of you,

0:28:49.780,0:28:54.640
it was still pushing you to live a life of slavery. To the point of wherever you went,

0:28:54.640,0:28:58.500
you were experiencing that extreme suffering. Is that right?

0:28:58.560,0:28:59.060
Yes.

0:29:01.240,0:29:05.100
I experienced rejection.

0:29:05.140,0:29:13.700
In my life, I stayed with 11 people and experienced a series of rejections.

0:29:13.720,0:29:19.000
They would sack me, "Go away", and I wouldn't know what to do.

0:29:19.080,0:29:27.400
I stayed with 11 people and experience maltreatment and abuse.

0:29:27.460,0:29:31.500
So, I went back.

0:29:31.520,0:29:37.900
The spirits still came to me.

0:29:37.980,0:29:45.920
When I went to Aflao, I had a dream that cars were destroyed

0:29:45.920,0:29:48.900
and raptures had taken place.

0:29:48.920,0:29:58.100
Cars and buildings were being destroyed. People were flying but I could not fly.

0:29:58.120,0:30:05.900
Then, I saw the Saviour, the Most High God, Jesus Christ.

0:30:05.960,0:30:08.680
So, what we understand from what our sister is saying,

0:30:08.680,0:30:14.700
she has really passed through many terrible, horrific life experiences

0:30:14.700,0:30:17.600
before her final coming to The SCOAN.

0:30:17.600,0:30:22.560
And you were explaining, sister, that those spirits continued to attack you.

0:30:22.560,0:30:26.440
Could you explain to us, just briefly, how those attacks would happen

0:30:26.440,0:30:34.100
and how that would affect you and your behaviour.

0:30:34.100,0:30:39.800
I talked about abuses - sexual abuse.

0:30:39.860,0:30:46.200
Any man I met always wanted to sleep with me.

0:30:46.200,0:30:52.300
Even if I told them my story, they would want to sleep with me.

0:30:52.340,0:31:00.200
The demons would enter the men and make them sleep with me.

0:31:00.240,0:31:09.100
When they would finish sleeping with me, they would tell me, "Go, I don't need you any longer"

0:31:09.100,0:31:10.700
and I would go.

0:31:10.780,0:31:19.200
I met a man who said the international NGO was not taking care of me properly.

0:31:19.240,0:31:27.700
He said he loved me and I too said I loved him. He said he wanted to help and marry me.

0:31:27.720,0:31:35.000
After sleeping with me, he said, "Everybody has needs",

0:31:35.000,0:31:48.000
that if I thought my needs would be provided by him, I was joking. He drove me out.

0:31:48.020,0:31:55.400
When I went to Aflao, I had a dream where I saw Jesus Christ:

0:31:55.460,0:32:03.480
Cars and building were being destroyed; I saw people flying - they were going to Heaven.

0:32:03.480,0:32:05.800
But I could not fly.

0:32:05.860,0:32:15.500
Then, I asked Jesus why I couldn't fly; that was it because of my sin,

0:32:15.540,0:32:19.600
that I had sinned against Him and could not control myself?

0:32:19.600,0:32:25.300
Then, He told me that He would put something on me that would stop me from sinning.

0:32:25.340,0:32:33.080
Sister, we want to now talk about the area whereby you actually found yourself here at The SCOAN.

0:32:33.080,0:32:37.480
We know that journey starting a long time ago. Even when you had that revelation.

0:32:37.480,0:32:40.020
Even in the midst of this terrible attack.

0:32:40.020,0:32:45.460
But, because of time, we want to understand how you finally came to be in The SCOAN.

0:32:45.460,0:32:48.000
So, just explain that to us.

0:32:48.020,0:32:58.500
During my trials, when I was wounded and broken on 'my way to Damaskus',

0:32:58.560,0:33:04.800
I met a 'Good Samaritan', a woman. I told her my story.

0:33:04.880,0:33:11.000
After that dream, snakes were entering my body. I could see them.

0:33:11.020,0:33:16.400
They entered my veins, stomach. They were three pythons.

0:33:16.420,0:33:21.200
They entered inside of me. They were here (head). Another one passed here (right waist).

0:33:21.260,0:33:24.900
Another one passed here (left waist). Very big. Another one passed here (back).

0:33:24.980,0:33:30.400
Then, the small ones used to tie me.

0:33:30.440,0:33:36.900
So, I told the woman about it.

0:33:36.980,0:33:42.700
She said that the only person who could deliver me

0:33:42.740,0:33:49.900
from all those demons was Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:33:49.960,0:33:54.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:54.880,0:34:08.720
That Good Samaritan, that woman helped me but it wasn't easy. It was very tough.

0:34:12.800,0:34:19.100
Sorry, sister. You mean to say that this Good Samaritan actually assisted you to come here to The SCOAN.

0:34:19.100,0:34:20.300
Is that right?

0:34:20.360,0:34:22.800
Yes.

0:34:22.820,0:34:25.640
She met you, and you explained your terrible situation.

0:34:25.640,0:34:28.640
She now advised you that God would use Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver you,

0:34:28.640,0:34:30.600
and she assisted you to come here.

0:34:30.600,0:34:35.940
Now, by the grace of God, we know that last week you were here in The SCOAN.

0:34:35.940,0:34:40.540
Finally, God brought you here. Two weeks ago, you were here in The SCOAN.

0:34:40.540,0:34:47.000
Tell us your experience when you came to the Church and the Morning Water was ministered to you.

0:34:47.000,0:34:57.500
When we got here and the Morning Water was ministered, a giant man rose within me.

0:34:57.540,0:35:03.000
He was talking inside of me.

0:35:03.000,0:35:09.400
Suddenly, it felt as if someone punched me in my face, and I fell down.

0:35:09.400,0:35:19.500
When I got up, I thought the evangelist had punched me. So, I wanted to fight him.

0:35:19.520,0:35:22.100
I wanted to ask him why he had punched me.

0:35:22.160,0:35:29.100
But looking at the video before coming out today, I saw that nobody punched me -

0:35:29.180,0:35:33.200
it was a divine punch.

0:35:33.260,0:35:36.700
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:35:36.780,0:35:40.780
So, during that whole period of the deliverance, all you could recall

0:35:40.780,0:35:44.240
was as if a giant man was within you, fighting, speaking

0:35:44.240,0:35:47.160
and suddenly you experienced something hitting you.

0:35:47.160,0:35:52.600
And you fell to the ground. That was the power of God defeating those demonic forces

0:35:52.600,0:35:55.700
that had held you captive since your childhood. Is that right?

0:35:55.700,0:35:56.500
Yes.

0:35:56.580,0:36:01.420
Glory be to God! Ever since that incredible deliverance at The SCOAN,

0:36:01.420,0:36:05.400
just tell us the changes that you have witnessed in your life.

0:36:05.440,0:36:09.500
Before, I couldn't sleep at night.

0:36:09.540,0:36:13.100
I would have to move around because I couldn't stay in one place.

0:36:13.180,0:36:18.000
If I would sit down before, I would feel as if I was sitting on a snake

0:36:18.020,0:36:23.100
and if I wanted to sleep, I would feel as if I was lying on a snake. So, I almost ran mad.

0:36:23.160,0:36:33.100
I had already ran mad. But after that punch, all the snakes melted away.

0:36:33.160,0:36:37.900
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:36:37.980,0:36:42.500
I was able to sleep like a baby.

0:36:42.580,0:36:47.400
Before, I never knew I was a normal human being.

0:36:47.420,0:36:51.640
I never saw myself as a normal human being.

0:36:51.640,0:36:56.900
But now, divinity has mixed with my humanity.

0:36:56.980,0:37:04.200
I am now a normal human being, in Jesus' name.

0:37:04.280,0:37:07.200
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:37:07.240,0:37:09.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:09.900,0:37:13.760
So, our sister really knows what she is talking about.

0:37:13.760,0:37:16.260
She has been under this bondage for her entire life.

0:37:16.260,0:37:20.000
And just since the deliverance, she has been walking and living in freedom.

0:37:20.040,0:37:23.000
Sister, how old are you right now?

0:37:23.040,0:37:27.960
I don't know my age, and I don't know my mother. I don't know her name,

0:37:27.960,0:37:32.700
I don't know my age. So, I can't tell you how old I am.

0:37:32.740,0:37:37.940
So, as you are talking now, you have no idea of the whereabouts of your parents,

0:37:37.940,0:37:43.280
or your extended family members? Because right from your childhood, as a baby,

0:37:43.280,0:37:45.400
you were separated from them.

0:37:45.480,0:37:47.300
No.

0:37:47.320,0:37:52.080
So, we can really understand what our sister has actually passed through

0:37:52.080,0:37:56.560
as a result of this evil spirit that entered her right from her childhood,

0:37:56.560,0:38:02.000
after she was used as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of her family.

0:38:02.060,0:38:08.320
We give glory to God that that curse was finally broken here at The SCOAN.

0:38:08.320,0:38:10.260
Sister, before moving ahead, we would like to ask you:

0:38:10.260,0:38:16.800
In the light of this experience, what do you want to advise our viewers all over the world?

0:38:16.860,0:38:29.600
Firstly, I would advise all viewers all over the world that the evil kingdom exists.

0:38:29.660,0:38:39.120
They want you to join them and the only way is - if you sin, you go to them.

0:38:39.120,0:38:46.900
They are also praying tirelessly for you to sin so that you will join them.

0:38:46.900,0:38:54.300
My advice is to stay away from sin.

0:38:54.320,0:39:07.400
Secondly, I have seen powers upon powers but there is a power beyond powers.

0:39:07.480,0:39:11.200
That is the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:39:11.220,0:39:15.400
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:39:15.460,0:39:23.200
The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua. Divinity that has residence in a human being.

0:39:23.260,0:39:28.300
The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua used Prophet T.B. Joshua to liberate me

0:39:28.300,0:39:33.500
from the kingdom of darkness to His glory.

0:39:33.560,0:39:37.300
Hallelujah!

0:39:37.300,0:39:42.200
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:39:42.200,0:39:45.500
Once again, we give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:39:45.500,0:39:51.680
He is the one that has liberated our sister, and it is a wonderful, very valuable lesson

0:39:51.680,0:39:53.500
that we can learn from her experience.

0:39:53.540,0:39:59.440
Physically, she was liberated from the shrine where she was living as a young girl.

0:39:59.440,0:40:02.400
She was taken out of that shrine physically

0:40:02.400,0:40:07.120
but spiritually, she was still under the torments of those evil spirits.

0:40:07.180,0:40:13.900
It was only here at The SCOAN where she finally received complete and total liberation

0:40:13.920,0:40:18.100
from her past through deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:40:18.100,0:40:23.000
Sister, we actually have a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:40:23.020,0:40:27.700
Upon hearing your story and what you have passed through,

0:40:27.720,0:40:36.920
Prophet T.B. Joshua actually used some people, made contact with some people in Ghana,

0:40:36.980,0:40:42.580
to try and locate your family home and where it is you are coming from.

0:40:42.580,0:40:45.800
You said earlier that you don't know your mother. Is that right?

0:40:45.820,0:40:46.900
Yes.

0:40:46.900,0:40:49.600
And you don't know your other family members?

0:40:49.660,0:40:51.100
No.

0:40:51.160,0:40:58.100
By the grace of God, through the arrangements and intervention of God's servant Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:40:58.160,0:41:03.300
in the Church today, we have a lady...

0:41:03.360,0:41:07.700
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:41:07.780,0:41:14.900
Testimony Time

0:41:14.980,0:41:21.200
She's going to come forward right now.

0:41:21.220,0:41:29.300
And she will be in the best position to explain who she is to our sister here.

0:41:29.320,0:41:38.900
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:41:38.980,0:41:46.640
So, right now, we actually - before anything else - quickly want to hear a word from one of the ladies here.

0:41:46.640,0:41:51.440
She is one of the people that God actually used through Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:41:51.440,0:41:55.940
to bring the other family members that are here.

0:41:55.940,0:41:59.440
Sister, you are welcome. Can you introduce yourself to us and

0:41:59.440,0:42:08.300
also explain who you are to the sister that has just spoken and who the other people are that are standing here.

0:42:08.380,0:42:10.800
Good morning, Church!

0:42:10.860,0:42:16.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:42:16.300,0:42:22.100
I am Mrs Rebekah Emirenus, popularly known as Mama Becky.

0:42:22.120,0:42:24.500
I am from Ghana.

0:42:24.580,0:42:30.100
I am an evangelist in the Medina market. That was where I saw Mary.

0:42:30.140,0:42:35.000
She came to me one day and told me all the stories she has told us.

0:42:35.020,0:42:40.280
I told her that it was only Prophet T.B. Joshua who could deliver her

0:42:40.280,0:42:46.300
and that she should keep praying for me so that if I got money, I would sponsor her to Lagos.

0:42:46.340,0:42:49.100
That was exactly what I did two weeks ago.

0:42:49.100,0:42:52.840
I was very happy when I saw Mary being delivered.

0:42:54.540,0:42:58.300
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:42:58.300,0:43:02.540
So, this is the sister that actually met our sister in Ghana

0:43:02.540,0:43:07.400
and sponsored her journey here to The SCOAN two weeks ago,

0:43:07.400,0:43:09.660
after listening to what she had passed through.

0:43:09.660,0:43:14.620
Stating that she needed to seek the face of God here at The SCOAN for deliverance.

0:43:14.620,0:43:18.800
So, after her deliverance, sister, what happened? What happened next?

0:43:18.820,0:43:24.720
After the deliverance, on Tuesday, Mary called me and said that the Prophet had sent somebody

0:43:24.720,0:43:33.300
to tell me to locate her mother in the Volta region. That was my first time of boarding a boat.

0:43:33.300,0:43:38.000
I took the boat and went to look for her mother, Mama Happy.

0:43:38.040,0:43:42.100
Fortunatley, when I went, she was there.

0:43:42.120,0:43:46.020
There were some people who wanted to say no

0:43:46.020,0:43:49.720
but finally, the uncle in that house said she could come with us.

0:43:49.720,0:43:52.140
That was how I brought mama to Accra.

0:43:52.400,0:43:58.380
She stayed with me on Wednesday and Thursday and then on Friday, we set off to this place.

0:43:58.560,0:44:04.900
You mean to say that the lady standing here is the mother of Mary?

0:44:04.940,0:44:07.800
That is Mama Happy, Mary's mother.

0:44:07.860,0:44:10.900
Mama, that is Mary.

0:44:10.920,0:44:14.600
Mary & Family (Deliverance Testimony)

0:44:14.660,0:44:17.500
And the brother beside her: Who is he?

0:44:17.540,0:44:22.200
The brother is Kofi. Mary's brother.

0:44:22.220,0:44:27.400
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:44:27.460,0:44:30.660
Madam, you didn't know this family before then.

0:44:30.660,0:44:35.580
It was only through the deliverance of our sister that you were sent on this assignment

0:44:35.580,0:44:38.860
to locate her mother that she had not seen. Is that right?

0:44:38.880,0:44:39.600
Yes.

0:44:39.640,0:44:42.900
Wednesday was the first time I saw Mama Happy.

0:44:42.900,0:44:47.800
That is Mary's mother and Kofi.

0:44:47.800,0:44:53.200
At this point, we want to hear just a quick word from our mother here

0:44:53.200,0:44:59.200
and we believe she will be speaking a local dialect. So our sister will help to translate.

0:44:59.220,0:45:02.260
Madam, you are very welcome, in Jesus' name.

0:45:02.260,0:45:04.500
Can you introduce yourself to us?

0:45:04.560,0:45:23.500
Mrs Happy (Mary's Mother) - A Ghanaian living in Cote D'Ivoire

0:45:23.580,0:45:29.580
We want to ask our mother. What can she say about what she has just heard now

0:45:29.580,0:45:33.500
and does she have to say to our sister that is here?

0:45:33.560,0:45:46.100
Deliverance Testimony

0:45:46.140,0:46:04.700
Mary is my daughter. I have been looking for her for many years.

0:46:04.780,0:46:12.600
Mary is her daughter. She had been looking for her. She never knew that she would ever see Mary again.

0:46:12.620,0:46:18.400
Mama, you mean to say that our sister here, you have not seen her for how many years?

0:46:18.460,0:46:24.400
Mary & Family (Deliverance Testimony)

0:46:24.480,0:46:33.200
Since she was three years old.

0:46:33.240,0:46:39.700
When Mary was three years old, she saw her last. Since then, she has not seen Mary.

0:46:39.740,0:46:44.900
So, she is seeing her for the first time here at The SCOAN after her deliverance.

0:46:44.940,0:46:49.300
Mama, we know that most of what you need to say will not be said in public,

0:46:49.360,0:46:53.760
but what do you want to say to Mary right now as she is standing here?

0:46:53.760,0:46:58.860
What do you have to say to her upon listening to her confession and seeing what she has passed through?

0:46:58.860,0:47:01.000
What do you actually want to tell her?

0:47:01.020,0:47:14.700
Mary & Family (Deliverance Testimony)

0:47:14.760,0:47:22.400
I am very happy to see Mary again.

0:47:22.440,0:47:28.520
My daughter should forgive me. God should forgive her as she didn't do that intentionally.

0:47:28.520,0:47:32.400
She didn't know anything. It was the tradition that did that.

0:47:32.400,0:47:35.300
God should forgive her.

0:47:35.380,0:47:39.920
So, we have heard it from our mother here. She is actually asking God for forgiveness.

0:47:39.920,0:47:45.280
She said it was the tradition of her time that actually caused her to take that decision

0:47:45.280,0:47:53.500
to actually give her little daughter to the shrine and today for the very first time, she has seen her daughter

0:47:53.500,0:47:58.680
here in The SCOAN, after her deliverance two weeks ago.

0:47:58.680,0:48:01.980
Once, again, brethren, this is a very emotional moment.

0:48:01.980,0:48:05.620
It is difficult for the family here to comprehend exactly what has happened.

0:48:05.620,0:48:09.360
And we understand that not everything can be said and done publicly

0:48:09.360,0:48:13.900
but we are bringing this to your attention for you to know what Jesus Christ has done.

0:48:13.900,0:48:20.400
So, we can see our mother right now, begging her daughter for forgiveness after what has happened.

0:48:20.460,0:48:28.100
Mary & Family (Deliverance Testimony)

0:48:28.180,0:48:37.500
As Prophet T.B. Joshua says: Whether victims or perpetrators,

0:48:37.540,0:48:42.500
we all stand in helpless need of the Saviour's forgiveness.

0:48:42.540,0:48:45.100
I have forgiven her.

0:48:45.140,0:48:53.500
Mary & Family (Deliverance Testimony)

0:48:53.540,0:48:55.460
Hallelujah! Glory be to God Almighty!

0:48:55.460,0:48:58.300
That is the power of forgiveness.

0:48:58.360,0:49:03.940
As our sister rightly said that whether victim or perpetrator, we all stand

0:49:03.940,0:49:06.320
in helpless need of God's divine forgiveness.

0:49:06.320,0:49:09.860
Our mother here - upon hearing her confession - has realised her wrong.

0:49:09.860,0:49:14.820
She said she is asking God for forgiveness because it was traditional at that time

0:49:14.820,0:49:16.360
for her to take such an action

0:49:16.360,0:49:20.600
and she has seen the terrible repercussions in her daughter's life ever since.

0:49:20.600,0:49:25.080
We know that this is a reconciliation only God can bring about.

0:49:25.080,0:49:29.800
It is not possible ordinarily, if not for the intervention of God

0:49:29.800,0:49:35.060
who used his servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to actually locate Mary's mother

0:49:35.060,0:49:40.300
far away in Ghana and bring her here today to reconcile with her daughter

0:49:40.300,0:49:43.220
that she is seeing for the very first time in so many years.

0:49:43.220,0:49:47.400
One more time, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:49:47.460,0:49:53.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:49:53.780,0:49:57.820
Finally, we are also seeing a young man here. We want to hear a quick word from him.

0:49:57.820,0:49:59.700
Brother, you are welcome.

0:49:59.760,0:50:08.680
I thank God for today is a big day for me.

0:50:08.680,0:50:14.160
God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to unite the family.

0:50:14.160,0:50:22.620
I thank God for what He has done. God is our Saviour.

0:50:22.620,0:50:27.300
I give glory to the God of T.B. Joshua.

0:50:27.320,0:50:32.180
I thank God for everything. I thank God that He is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.

0:50:32.180,0:50:41.500
I thank God because He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to bring us here today. I give all the glory to God.

0:50:41.520,0:50:44.700
Hallelujah! Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:50:44.720,0:50:48.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:50:48.440,0:50:52.780
We thank God for our sister's deliverance and what you have just seen now - the reconciliation.

0:50:52.780,0:50:55.980
We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance

0:50:55.980,0:50:58.340
by making the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:50:58.340,0:51:02.800
And we know that upon hearing your confession, people of God are ready to come together

0:51:02.800,0:51:09.760
to support you to start a new life in Christ; now that you have finally liberated from the shekels of satan

0:51:09.760,0:51:14.700
and indeed, as Christians, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:51:14.780,0:51:20.080
After her glorious testimony, reunion and reconciliation with her family,

0:51:20.080,0:51:23.760
Mary sat down to have a meal with her mother and brother

0:51:23.760,0:51:31.400
for the first time in so many years. Let's join them at this happy occasion.

0:51:31.460,0:52:10.500
Mary & Family Eating Together Enjoying Each Other's Company

0:52:10.580,0:52:17.900
We thank God for this great day in my life.

0:52:17.900,0:52:28.000
We also thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV and the whole congregation

0:52:28.000,0:52:32.600
for this great deliverance in my life.

0:52:32.600,0:52:38.340
It is actually a new day and a new beginning in Christ Jesus.

0:52:38.380,0:52:49.760
I also thank Mama Becky, my Good Samaritan, for such a role that she played in my life.

0:52:49.760,0:52:54.440
There is a wise saying that says that on the road to your divine destiny,

0:52:54.440,0:52:56.600
you need to meet the right people.

0:52:56.680,0:52:59.200
I think she is the right person.

0:52:59.260,0:53:07.760
This is the first time in my life I am meeting with my family, gathered and enjoying,

0:53:07.760,0:53:18.000
eating together at a table, and I am so happy and overjoyed.

0:53:18.080,0:53:25.900
I have forgiven her and forgiven everyone in my family, in Jesus' name.

0:53:25.920,0:53:26.800
Amen.

0:53:26.860,0:53:50.600
Mary & Family Eating Together And Enjoying Each Other's Company

0:53:50.600,0:54:02.560
She is lost of words; she is singing to glorify God for bringing us together.

0:54:02.560,0:54:09.080
She is overjoyed. So, she is singing to glorify God for a great day.

0:54:09.080,0:54:10.220
Emmanuel!

0:54:10.900,0:54:17.300
I want to tell the viewers that there are many people like Mary, who are crying -

0:54:17.300,0:54:19.900
they don't have people to talk to.

0:54:19.980,0:54:23.100
If they come to you, show them the way.

0:54:23.100,0:54:28.600
The way is Jesus Christ and nothing else. Leave everything in the hands of God.

0:54:28.640,0:54:32.720
We really congratulate this family and thank God for what He has done

0:54:32.720,0:54:40.580
in the life of this family. We believe this is just the beginning of great things to happen

0:54:40.580,0:54:46.100
in this family. And the man of God, Sr. Prophet T.B. Joshua has sent us to the family -

0:54:46.100,0:54:52.880
the mother of Mary and also the brother

0:54:52.880,0:54:59.300
and our dear madam God used to bring Mary to The SCOAN.

0:54:59.340,0:55:07.580
The man of God has said that Mary is going to spend some more days in the presence of God.

0:55:07.580,0:55:13.900
After which, she will be joining the family again.

0:55:13.940,0:55:20.980
In the meantime, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has asked us to give the family

0:55:20.980,0:55:25.800
the sum of 100,000 Naira for their transport back to Ghana.

0:55:25.860,0:55:28.260
Mrs Happy, Mary's Mother Receiving A Cash Gift Of 100,000 Naira

0:55:28.260,0:55:32.200
from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

0:55:32.260,0:55:34.560
I thank you all.

0:55:34.560,0:55:42.840
God says, When you don't forgive your neighbour, He cannot forgive you.

0:55:42.840,0:55:46.060
I want my daughter to forgive me so that we will be at peace and live together.

0:55:46.060,0:55:49.300
I pray God will forgive me all my sins.

0:55:49.300,0:55:56.180
She is actually thanking the man of God for such a wonderful gift

0:55:56.180,0:55:59.000
that she has received from him.

Mary & Family Reconciled In Jesus' Name

0:56:14.820,0:56:18.900
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:56:18.920,0:56:25.440
The following Sunday, after sharing her life experience and being reunited with her biological mother,

0:56:25.440,0:56:29.880
Mary returned to The SCOAN to give thanks to God

0:56:29.880,0:56:34.400
for how her life had changed since her deliverance.

0:56:34.440,0:56:44.000
I was delivered from demonic slavery where I was sent to a shrine to serve an idol.

0:56:44.060,0:56:57.000
I continued living in slavery all my life from the age of one until I was delivered in The SCOAN.

0:56:57.020,0:57:08.100
I was delivered; I was liberated spiritually, materially and physically, as you can see now.

0:57:08.160,0:57:15.600
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:57:15.600,0:57:23.100
I am here to thank the Lord Almighty for His kindness and favour,

0:57:23.100,0:57:30.300
upon my life, upon all the people and upon my family.

0:57:30.340,0:57:36.900
Last week Sunday, I was introduced to my family.

0:57:36.980,0:57:45.400
I was reunited with my family and my mother and that was the day I knew how old I was.

0:57:45.400,0:57:48.300
Now, I am thirty years old.

0:57:48.340,0:57:53.200
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

0:57:53.280,0:57:58.800
It was really surprising to learn how old I was.

0:57:58.800,0:58:02.100
It is by the grace of God Almighty.

0:58:02.160,0:58:10.620
I want to take this opportunity, viewers all over the world and people sitting in this congregation,

0:58:10.620,0:58:15.900
to thank God Almighty and thank Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:58:15.900,0:58:23.300
for his love for humanity, the love that is radiating within his veins,

0:58:23.320,0:58:25.800
that I am enjoying today.

0:58:25.880,0:58:33.420
When I was delivered, he actually took care of me, clothed me and washed me

0:58:33.420,0:58:38.700
spiritually, physically, materially and financially.

0:58:38.700,0:58:41.000
People of God, Emmanuel!

0:58:41.060,0:58:44.200
Deliverance Testimony

0:58:44.280,0:58:48.500
I want to thank him.

0:58:48.560,0:58:52.100
I want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:58:52.180,0:58:59.300
I want to thank you for your love that you have.

0:58:59.340,0:59:05.080
As God Almighty has radiated His power within you,

0:59:05.080,0:59:15.900
you have selflessly devoted yourself to God and were used to deliver me from demonic slavery.

0:59:15.900,0:59:17.700
I am free.

0:59:17.780,0:59:20.100
I am not a Trokosi.

0:59:20.160,0:59:22.000
I am not Osu.

0:59:22.000,0:59:25.300
I am not an outcast.

0:59:25.300,0:59:32.880
I am a bonafide citizen of God, co-king with Christ, co-heir with Christ.

0:59:32.880,0:59:38.000
I am born of God through Christ Jesus by faith.

0:59:38.000,0:59:45.600
1 John 5:4-5 says that whoever is born of God overcomes the world.

0:59:45.620,0:59:49.700
This is the victory that overcomes the world - our faith.

0:59:49.720,0:59:57.800
Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.

0:59:57.880,0:59:59.600
I am an overcomer.

0:59:59.620,1:00:06.700
God Almighty gave birth to me through Christ Jesus by faith.

1:00:06.700,1:00:08.100
Deliverance Testimony

1:00:08.120,1:00:10.000
Emmanuel!

1:00:10.060,1:00:13.200
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

1:00:13.200,1:00:16.400
Deliverance Testimony

1:00:16.440,1:00:23.200
We are here this morning with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua for our sister Mary.

1:00:23.280,1:00:26.220
We have listened to her experiences last week.

1:00:26.220,1:00:29.300
We know how she has been suffering in her entire life.

1:00:29.340,1:00:35.500
Even before coming to The SCOAN, she was under this very extreme demonic influence -

1:00:35.500,1:00:40.900
unable to have a job, unable to live like a normal person in society.

1:00:40.900,1:00:46.300
But we can all testify all today that she is free and we can see the glory of God shining in her life.

1:00:46.300,1:00:50.240
So, Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he wants to support you

1:00:50.240,1:00:53.900
to start a new life in Christ Jesus.

1:00:53.980,1:00:56.800
Amen.

1:00:56.820,1:01:01.320
On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide,

1:01:01.320,1:01:08.300
we are here today to present to you the gift of 1,500 USD.

1:01:08.380,1:01:12.600
Mary (Deliverance Testimony)

1:01:12.600,1:01:14.140
Mary Receives 1,500 USD From T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

1:01:14.160,1:01:21.080
The equivalent of over 600,000 Naira, which is for our sister to start a new life in Christ Jesus

1:01:21.080,1:01:24.640
now that she has been delivered from the kingdom of darkness.

1:01:24.640,1:01:27.200
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

1:01:27.280,1:01:35.000
People all over the world and everyone here,

1:01:35.000,1:01:48.400
help me to thank the man of God and to thank God Almighty for such high amount to start life with.

1:01:48.420,1:01:55.500
He is indeed a man of love; a man of kindness;

1:01:55.540,1:02:03.600
a man that can offer such a huge gift to me.

1:02:03.660,1:02:12.600
I had gone to many churches for this deliverance but couldn't get it

1:02:12.660,1:02:23.000
but here, I was delivered and on top of it all, I was given such an amount to start life with.

1:02:23.080,1:02:27.300
Indeed, God is with us.

1:02:27.320,1:02:34.400
Mary Receives 1,500 USD From T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

1:02:34.420,1:02:41.500
Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua. I am happy with your gift.

1:02:41.500,1:02:49.800
I will start a new life in Christ Jesus with the money you have given me.

1:02:49.860,1:02:57.580
I know that this amount with Christ and with your prayer and your fatherly love

1:02:57.580,1:03:02.200
and people all over the world who send their love and support,

1:03:02.220,1:03:06.740
I think life is a race in a tunnel.

1:03:06.740,1:03:13.300
I pray that at the end of the tunnel, when the Saviour comes,

1:03:13.380,1:03:19.900
we all will be caught up to the final ride with Christ.

1:03:19.920,1:03:22.200
Amen.

1:03:22.220,1:03:27.100
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

1:03:27.140,1:03:31.600
Once again, for those who may not have witnessed the experience of our sister,

1:03:31.600,1:03:33.420
or listened to the experience of our sister last week,

1:03:33.420,1:03:40.540
she said it was last week, here at The SCOAN, that she actually met and reconciled with her family -

1:03:40.540,1:03:44.300
particularly her mother - for the very first time.

1:03:44.300,1:03:48.220
We can see clips on the screen here that were taken after the service,

1:03:48.220,1:03:54.700
showing how mother and daughter sat down together and began relating and talking to each other.

1:03:54.760,1:03:59.120
Even feeding each other for the very first time in their lives.

1:03:59.120,1:04:05.300
Sister, just tell us what you can say about the reconciliation that happened here.

1:04:05.340,1:04:11.400
It was a great day for me because I was eating with my mother for the first time,

1:04:11.480,1:04:17.900
eating a sumptious meal for the first time without people giving me food,

1:04:17.940,1:04:23.800
sitting down with drinks and people around who love me.

1:04:23.860,1:04:33.100
It was just a wonderful day, a wonderful meal and a wonderful reconciliation in the Lord.

1:04:33.180,1:04:36.900
Thank you, Jesus. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

1:04:36.980,1:04:42.740
Sister, we thank God for your life. We would like to ask you finally: What would be your word of advice

1:04:42.740,1:04:46.600
based on all that Jesus Christ has done for you and all that you passed through in life?

1:04:46.600,1:04:51.500
What do you really want to advise people of God and those present here?

1:04:51.580,1:05:00.000
I would advise people all over the world to stay away from sin

1:05:00.020,1:05:10.100
because the darker world is praying tirelessly that you should sin so that they can get your soul.

1:05:10.140,1:05:21.800
The advice is to stay away from sin and close to Christ. He is the only Way, the Truth and the Light.

1:05:21.880,1:05:26.420
The greatest sacrifice has been made 2,000 years ago.

1:05:26.480,1:05:36.700
That is the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary, not human beings.

1:05:36.780,1:05:47.000
The greatest sacrifice has been made. So, make Christ your life partner, your will and your goal.

1:05:47.080,1:05:52.300
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

1:05:52.360,1:05:55.440
Once again, sister, we thank God for your life. We pray that God will give you the grace

1:05:55.440,1:06:00.540
to make His Word the standard for your life and we know that with the support of Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:06:00.540,1:06:04.560
and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide - this wonderful gift you received right now -

1:06:04.560,1:06:07.020
better is not good enough, the best is yet to come!

1:06:07.020,1:06:11.900
We know you will be coming back with more wonderful testimonies to the glory of God Almighty!

1:06:11.940,1:06:13.300
Yes.

1:06:13.360,1:06:14.800
Wonderful testimonies.
