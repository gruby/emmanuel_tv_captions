Please, Father, heal me!

0:00:08.820,0:00:13.100
I had an accident and my arm and leg were affected.

0:00:13.100,0:00:16.700
Because I don't have any cartilage in my knee, whenever I walk, it is so painful.

0:00:16.700,0:00:19.340
I cannot walk!

0:00:19.340,0:00:20.500
Please, heal me!

0:00:20.500,0:00:23.160
I want to run; please, heal me!

Lee Hyun Ju - Deajeon, South Korea

0:01:40.320,0:01:44.540
Good morning. My name is Lee Hyun Ju. I am from Deajeon in South Korea.

0:01:44.540,0:01:49.320
One and a half years ago, I had an accident.

0:01:49.320,0:01:54.180
I sustained a fracture in my right leg and shoulder.

0:01:54.180,0:01:58.060
Unfortunately, I had an operation.

0:01:58.060,0:02:01.820
During the operation, I had iron rods inserted

0:02:01.820,0:02:07.200
and after one year, they were removed by another operation.

0:02:07.200,0:02:15.600
During my rehabilitation, the doctors discovered that I had no cartilage in my right knee.

0:02:15.600,0:02:23.960
The doctor told me that due to the inflammation, I could develop severe rheumatism.

0:02:23.960,0:02:33.980
The rehabilitation did not solve the problem.

0:02:33.980,0:02:38.320
It greatly affected my daily activities.

0:02:38.320,0:02:42.060
About one and a half years ago, I had a severe accident.

0:02:42.060,0:02:45.580
Because of that, I had to undergo an operation.

0:02:45.580,0:02:54.000
I went for rehabilitation because I was experiencing severe pain and I had no other choice.

0:02:54.000,0:02:59.500
Even though I went for rehabilitation, the pain remained the same and I also then experienced other problems.

0:02:59.500,0:03:05.500
So, I went to the doctor again, and he told me that there were more problems.

0:03:05.500,0:03:09.300
The doctor said that due to the inflammation, I was a hundred percent likely to develop rheumatism.

0:03:09.300,0:03:13.500
The doctor told me that I would suffer from rheumatism.

0:03:20.780,0:03:26.560
Due to the accident, I had a fracture to my right leg and shoulder.

0:03:26.560,0:03:44.580
The doctor said that the joints of my right leg had been seriously shattered.

0:03:44.580,0:03:48.020
It really affected my daily activities.

0:03:48.020,0:03:54.500
I received the promise of God concerning my problem, through this crusade.

0:03:54.500,0:03:56.340
So, I came to this crusade.

0:03:56.340,0:04:00.020
It is for more than one and a half years that I suffered from this pain.

0:04:00.020,0:04:04.460
Because of this pain, I could not walk or stand for a long time.

0:04:04.460,0:04:07.900
There were a lot of problems in my daily life.

0:04:07.900,0:04:13.780
Because I could not walk, I could not go out.

0:04:13.780,0:04:20.980
I needed somebody to help me. My condition caused me to become depressed.

0:04:20.980,0:04:29.760
Without the assistance of my family members, I could not do anything.

0:04:29.760,0:04:32.980
Basically, I could not walk or stand for a long time.

0:04:32.980,0:04:36.560
Therefore, I could not go out very often.

0:04:36.560,0:04:44.340
Because of the pain, without the help of my family, I could not walk, stand or go somewhere.

0:04:44.340,0:04:52.800
Because I had a problem with my arm, I could not work.

0:04:52.800,0:04:56.560
Especially when I am working, I make a lot of use of my arms.

0:04:56.560,0:05:00.240
But because of this accident, I had to quit my job.

0:05:00.240,0:05:02.620
I went to several hospitals in search of a solution.

0:05:02.620,0:05:14.920
I also went to church and prayed without the belief that I could receive healing.

0:05:14.920,0:05:19.840
First of all, I went to the hospital and I also went to church and prayed

0:05:19.840,0:05:23.220
but I didn't think that it would really help me.

0:05:23.220,0:05:30.440
The doctor told me to avoid using my knees

0:05:30.440,0:05:46.180
and that I should wear the recommended leg brace.

0:05:46.180,0:05:51.900
Because of the severe pain, the doctor told me to use the knee brace.

0:05:51.900,0:05:57.200
When she came to the crusade, tell us what actually happened. What took place?

0:05:57.200,0:06:10.720
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time

0:06:10.720,0:06:18.140
I had the confidence and faith that God would heal me this time.

0:06:18.140,0:06:21.940
I had the faith that God would heal me.

0:06:21.940,0:06:40.360
When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I felt the light of the Holy Spirit touch my whole body.

0:06:40.360,0:06:48.680
I asked myself, "What is this?" After that, Prophet T.B. Joshua told me to stand up and walk

0:06:48.680,0:06:56.740
and because I had faith, I received healing from God; I started to run!

0:06:56.740,0:07:04.940
When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to me and touched my body, I felt like a lightning coming through my body

0:07:04.940,0:07:11.880
and when he told me to walk and run, I had the faith that I could then run

0:07:11.880,0:07:16.840
so as you see in the video, I was able to run.

0:07:16.840,0:07:22.860
Indeed we saw you running to the glory of God, after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:07:22.860,0:07:27.900
and you are here today standing without your brace and without any walking aid.

0:07:27.900,0:07:30.040
How are you feeling now?

0:07:30.040,0:07:44.180
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time

0:07:44.180,0:07:51.620
Now, I am very well. I have no doubts about the healing I have received.

0:07:51.620,0:08:01.960
Now,  I no longer need the leg brace and can move around freely.

0:08:01.960,0:08:03.400
Hallelujah!

South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time

0:08:09.480,0:08:11.380
Right now, I feel very good.

0:08:11.380,0:08:15.920
Also, as you can see, I don't need my leg brace anymore.

0:08:15.920,0:08:21.600
I also have the faith that this healing will remain forever.

0:08:21.600,0:08:26.400
I can now do a lot of things that I could not do before.

0:08:26.400,0:08:27.680
Amen! Glory be to God!

0:08:27.680,0:08:33.560
Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:08:33.560,0:08:41.720
And there you can see her jogging - doing what she could not do before.

0:08:41.720,0:08:44.800
We would like you to walk in the midst of the children of God.

0:08:44.800,0:08:50.100
Just walk and show us that you are now healed to the glory of God.

0:08:50.100,0:08:54.520
There you can see her walking -

0:08:54.520,0:09:00.220
doing what she could not do before!

0:09:00.220,0:09:07.820
That is healing in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:09:07.820,0:09:13.740
She is here today without her brace, which is a clear evidence and proof

0:09:13.740,0:09:18.740
that Jesus Christ has healed her completely and effectually!

0:09:48.480,0:09:56.880
You should not have an ounce of doubt that God can heal you.

0:09:56.880,0:10:09.680
Yesterday at the crusade, before the prayer, I said, "God, thank You for healing me".

0:10:09.680,0:10:14.080
Jesus heard my prayer and responded to me by providing my complete healing.

0:10:14.080,0:10:23.500
So, you too, don't lose hope; thank God for your healing before you even receive it.

0:10:23.500,0:10:30.040

0:10:30.040,0:10:34.640
Praise the Lord! I want to tell you that you should not have doubt.

0:10:34.640,0:10:40.140
I already told God, "Thank You, Jesus, for healing me" before my healing.

0:10:40.140,0:10:46.680
If you have faith that God will heal you, then, you will be healed

0:10:46.680,0:10:56.540
If you are afraid of whether you will be healed, just tell God, "Thank You, Jesus, that you have healed me".

0:10:56.540,0:11:01.960
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
