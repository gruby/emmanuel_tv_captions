0:00:00.060,0:00:26.580
My name is Chief Ikenna Victor Egbuna.

0:00:26.580,0:00:32.260
I am a native of Onicha (Nigeria).

0:00:32.260,0:00:47.480
I am a lawyer. I'm also a chartered insurer and chartered accountant.

0:00:47.480,0:01:02.500
I have come to give all glory to the Almighty for lifting me from the valley to the mountaintop.

0:01:02.500,0:01:12.200
My problem started in 1986 when I came back from my national youth service.

0:01:12.200,0:01:18.380
I happened to come from a family of idol worshippers.

0:01:18.380,0:01:23.680
I am a descendant of red cap chiefs on both sides.

0:01:23.680,0:01:29.060
I was only 9 years old when my father died.

0:01:29.060,0:01:36.260
Because of the challenges in the family, I became very close to my mother.

0:01:36.260,0:01:43.200
In fact, I was usually referred to as her handbag.

0:01:43.200,0:01:46.460
But when I came back from the youth service,

0:01:46.460,0:01:57.060
one day, one of my uncles came and told my mother that they went to consult an idol

0:01:57.060,0:02:04.880
to find out why members of my family die at a very young age.

0:02:04.880,0:02:10.280
After the consultation, as they were leaving, the woman was calling them,

0:02:10.280,0:02:13.700
"Come, come! Ikenna, Ikenna!"

0:02:13.700,0:02:15.540
And they asked, "Why?"

0:02:15.540,0:02:19.920
She said, "Look, there is a young man in your family who is a lawyer.

0:02:19.920,0:02:24.500
His name is Ikenna, and he is going to die!"

0:02:24.500,0:02:28.580
So, my mother started panicking and asked, "What do we do?"

0:02:28.580,0:02:31.980
He said, "The priestess said they should bring me".

0:02:31.980,0:02:40.840
So, they took me to the lady with my elder sister, she performed her concoctions,

0:02:40.840,0:02:47.640
used a razor blade to give me marks and inserted those things on my body.

0:02:47.640,0:03:00.540
From that day, my mother hated me with passion and everything I did was not acceptable to her.

0:03:00.540,0:03:05.300
In my professional background - I started my career as a lawyer -

0:03:05.300,0:03:11.300
in fact, within six months, my principal asked me to leave his office.

0:03:11.300,0:03:16.900
I tried to get another place to work - I did not.

0:03:16.900,0:03:22.740
At a point, because I was proficient in mathematics, I started looking for what else to do.

0:03:22.740,0:03:24.980
I started studying insurance.

0:03:24.980,0:03:32.160
It took me seven years to qualify as an associate of the Chartered Insurance Institute, London.

0:03:32.160,0:03:34.260
I became a chartered insurer.

0:03:34.260,0:03:39.080
I started looking for jobs. I would apply and be shortlisted.

0:03:39.080,0:03:46.780
The day the application would be unsealed, it would be discovered that I did not even sign it.

0:03:46.780,0:03:52.760
I looked for other jobs - assistant general manager at Ajaokuta Steel,

0:03:52.760,0:04:00.640
secretary NJSC, chief registrar at court - there must be one problem along the line.

0:04:00.640,0:04:05.680
But one thing that is significant, is that at every of such application,

0:04:05.680,0:04:10.800
I would have a dream - a strange woman would come and sleep with me.

0:04:10.800,0:04:17.540
After that, everything about that would go.

0:04:17.540,0:04:29.560
That continued until I heard about The SCOAN, and I came to meet with the man of God.

0:04:29.560,0:04:38.840
When I met him one-on-one, he gave me this Morning Water and this booklet

0:04:38.840,0:04:53.060
titled 'What The Future Holds'. He signed his signature on it and gave it to me.

0:04:53.060,0:05:08.040
From that day, my destiny started the journey of restoration.

0:05:08.040,0:05:14.240
Before, I would go to court, do a case very well but would not be able to collect money.

0:05:14.240,0:05:19.800
In some cases, I did not even collect a dime.

0:05:19.800,0:05:33.300
Later, with the visit to The SCOAN, I no longer witnessed any strange person coming to sleep with me.

0:05:33.300,0:05:37.960
I dropped the certificates of insurance and accounting

0:05:37.960,0:05:44.720
and went back to my original profession - the legal profession.

0:05:44.720,0:05:50.220
One night, after praying with the man of God on the screen

0:05:50.220,0:05:54.540
and administering the Morning Water, I saw him in the dream.

0:05:54.540,0:05:58.340
I discovered myself in my first office.

0:05:58.340,0:06:02.520
I discovered I was lying helplessly in the office

0:06:02.520,0:06:05.820
and the protector was locked with about three keys.

0:06:05.820,0:06:09.000
I was locked up inside that office.

0:06:09.000,0:06:12.240
And the man of God came.

0:06:12.240,0:06:16.120
When I saw him, I jumped up, "Man of God! Man of God!"

0:06:16.120,0:06:26.900
He just opened the keys and asked me to come out.

0:06:26.900,0:06:29.680
And I came out.

0:06:29.680,0:06:40.440
From that day, my destiny started a very fsst recovery journey.

0:06:40.440,0:06:53.600
And today, I am a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.

0:06:53.600,0:06:59.880
That is the highest professional accomplishment in the legal profession.

0:06:59.880,0:07:11.700
I was sworn in on the 18th of September, 2017.

0:07:11.700,0:07:19.060
In the list, which is on this board, I am Number 7,

0:07:19.060,0:07:24.100
out of the 30 people that were made senior advocates.

0:07:24.100,0:07:33.840
Over 500 people applied, 169 were shortlisted and only 30 were awarded the rank.

0:07:33.840,0:07:41.680
And I am Number 7 among them.

0:07:41.680,0:07:52.760
The picture you see here is myself in my full regalia as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.

0:07:52.760,0:08:01.160
This one is the one we took at the Supreme Court on the Swearing-In Day with my dear wife.

0:08:01.160,0:08:07.820
This one too is also a photograph we took on that day

0:08:07.820,0:08:17.280
with my brother-in-the-Lord Oche Nabi Esquire, Senior Advocate of Nigeria.

0:08:17.280,0:08:23.360
On the board here - I attended the University of Ife where I graduated in 1984.

0:08:23.360,0:08:26.320
This is my graduation certificate.

0:08:26.320,0:08:34.440
I was called to the bar in 1985. This is my certificate.

0:08:34.440,0:08:38.600
I became an associate of the Chartered Insurance Institute, London.

0:08:38.600,0:08:42.380
This is my qualification, my certificate.

0:08:42.380,0:08:49.860
Now, because the Insurance Institute, London, is the first all over the world,

0:08:49.860,0:08:54.000
if you are a member of that institute, you can get a job anywhere.

0:08:54.000,0:09:00.900
When I got frustrated in Nigeria, I applied to England, to formally elect me as an associate.

0:09:00.900,0:09:05.920
And in 2004, they did. This is the certificate.

0:09:05.920,0:09:15.360
I read my accountancy at the University of Ife. This is my certificate.

0:09:15.360,0:09:21.920
I became a member of the Association of National Accountants in 2001.

0:09:21.920,0:09:25.060
So, sir, with all of these certificates and qualifications,

0:09:25.060,0:09:29.180
you mean, you were still experiencing such severe stagnation

0:09:29.180,0:09:32.600
until you encountered Jesus Christ here at The SCOAN.

0:09:32.600,0:09:43.700
Yes. The only thing that worked in my life was reading 24 hours in a day and passing exams.

0:09:43.700,0:09:47.700
But I never got any job.

0:09:47.700,0:09:55.880
It was only when I came to The SCOAN, where I was given the Morning Water

0:09:55.880,0:10:06.100
and the man of God released me from the 'spiritual sale' I didn't know I was in

0:10:06.100,0:10:11.100
that my destiny started shining again.

0:10:11.100,0:10:17.700
I started getting big briefs again and now, I am a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.

0:10:17.700,0:10:23.300
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:23.300,0:10:28.440
Tell us - after you encountered Jesus here, what changes have you experienced in that area,

0:10:28.440,0:10:30.640
in terms of your relationship with your family.

0:10:30.640,0:10:35.240
My relationship with my mother changed.

0:10:35.240,0:10:39.800
On day, she called me on the phone and asked, "Where are you?"

0:10:39.800,0:10:42.400
I told her. She said, "I want to see you".

0:10:42.400,0:10:50.800
When I went to see her, she said, "Ikenna, I don't know what happened between us".

0:10:50.800,0:10:58.000
It is as clear as daylight that it was that demonic influence of that...

0:10:58.000,0:11:03.560
I don't know whether it was the initiation they did to me that caused the whole thing.

0:11:03.560,0:11:10.520
Today, our relationship is restored. I am back as her handbag.

0:11:10.520,0:11:13.700
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:11:13.700,0:11:17.280
Sir, you said, before, you were plagued with such terrible nightmares,

0:11:17.280,0:11:20.100
sleeping with women at the point of breakthrough in your dreams.

0:11:20.100,0:11:23.700
Just tell us - after you came here, what changed in that area?

0:11:23.700,0:11:29.120
As soon as I came here, I stopped having such experience.

0:11:29.120,0:11:35.700
In fact, the last experience I had - somebody came and I said, "I don't know who you are!"

0:11:35.700,0:11:39.980
She started trying to convince me and I saw myself beating her,

0:11:39.980,0:11:44.900
something I have never done in my life. I gave her serious blows and she had to run away.

0:11:44.900,0:11:48.380
And that was the last time I experienced that in my life.

0:11:48.380,0:11:52.720
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:11:52.720,0:11:58.000
When I compiled my applications - because for the application as Senior Advocate,

0:11:58.000,0:12:02.840
you compile judgements you have obtained that are landmark judgements.

0:12:02.840,0:12:06.520
In fact, they are contained in about four big 'Ghana-must-go' (plastic bags).

0:12:06.520,0:12:12.380
What I did was to place the man of God's signature on it.

0:12:12.380,0:12:15.720
Every two days I would change it to the other one.

0:12:15.720,0:12:20.240
It was after about 8 days that I decided to go and submit the application.

0:12:20.240,0:12:26.140
And in my mind I was convinced that my application had the signature of the Almighty.

0:12:26.140,0:12:32.640
And indeed, it was successful. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:32.640,0:12:36.100
Children of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:12:36.100,0:12:38.860
In fact, as you can see, I am so happy!

0:12:38.860,0:12:43.740
I don't know how to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:43.740,0:12:47.360
After 31 years of stagnation in practice,

0:12:47.360,0:12:52.480
we had an encounter with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:52.480,0:12:57.000
Our sorrow turned to joy and testimonies.

0:12:57.000,0:13:01.040
And my husband has said it all.

0:13:01.040,0:13:05.020
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:05.020,0:13:08.420
My word of advice goes like this:

0:13:08.420,0:13:21.080
Prophet T.B. Joshua is God's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

0:13:21.080,0:13:24.940
I say so on the following grounds:

0:13:24.940,0:13:38.960
One, The SCOAN is the biggest healing and therapeutic centre all over the world.

0:13:38.960,0:13:53.720
Two, Prophet T.B. Joshua is God's biggest micro and macro economist

0:13:53.720,0:14:06.240
who predicts the economy of the whole world with precision, without statistics.

0:14:06.240,0:14:19.500
Three, Prophet T.B. Joshua is God's inspector general of the whole world.

0:14:19.500,0:14:35.120
He predicts security challenges - be it in Syria, North Korea, United States - and proffers solutions.

0:14:35.120,0:14:45.600
Number Four, The SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua have created a platform

0:14:45.600,0:14:50.040
for hundreds of thousands of people to see God.

0:14:50.040,0:15:05.760
I am talking about the Emmanuel TV Partners who go about the whole world doing good.

0:15:05.760,0:15:20.320
Number Five, Prophet T.B. Joshua is a man overly endowed with Christian urbanity.

0:15:20.320,0:15:29.200
I am talking about his reconcilitation ministry, his being father to the fatherless,

0:15:29.200,0:15:43.240
and in fact, hope to the hopeless.

0:15:43.240,0:16:14.140
Number Six, Prophet T.B. Joshua is one of the few positive images of this country.

0:16:14.140,0:16:22.180
If you go outside Nigeria, the only thing you hear about Nigerians are negative things.

0:16:22.180,0:16:28.260
But it is only because of Prophet T.B. Joshua that many countries have established

0:16:28.260,0:16:42.720
and others are seeking to establish diplomatic relations with Nigeria.

0:16:42.720,0:16:54.740
Finally, my advice is that anybody - be him a Nigerian or a foreigner -

0:16:54.740,0:17:04.260
who has not visited The SCOAN is cheating himself. Thank you.

0:17:04.260,0:17:16.000
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
