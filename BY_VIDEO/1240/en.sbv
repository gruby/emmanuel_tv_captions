0:00:00.000,0:00:06.220
I can hear chains falling - chains of affliction.

0:00:06.220,0:00:14.880
Satan uses these chains to connect affliction to people - to himself.

0:00:14.880,0:00:16.880
That is an instrument;

0:00:16.880,0:00:23.920
he uses chains to connect people and that affliction in you is what he is going to use

0:00:23.920,0:00:27.360
as a chain to connect you to himself.

0:00:27.360,0:00:36.260
But, in this case - I can hear chains falling!

0:00:36.260,0:00:47.680
These are his weapons: affliction, poverty, hardship, setback, rejection, challenges.

0:00:47.680,0:00:55.780
These are his instruments; these are things he manufactures, and he is using them.

0:00:55.780,0:01:04.620
When he sees people happy, with your handset, internet, you suddenly receive a phone call.

0:01:04.620,0:01:06.500
"Hello."

0:01:06.500,0:01:09.760
The news you hear there can change your heart again.

0:01:09.760,0:01:13.820
Before you know it, you begin to be unhappy.

0:01:13.820,0:01:17.240
That is the work of satan.

0:01:17.240,0:01:21.380
He is now using technology to get people.

0:01:21.380,0:01:28.880
When you are stable, suddenly, you will receive a phone call, a text message,

0:01:28.880,0:01:31.240
just to make you unhappy.

0:01:31.240,0:01:35.060
The state of your heart matters.

0:01:35.060,0:01:38.400
The state of my heart matters.

0:01:38.400,0:01:45.400
If the state of your heart is at its best – here is Jesus.

0:01:45.400,0:01:54.060
If the state of my heart is at its best – here is Jesus.

0:01:54.060,0:01:57.880
Now, you can bring Jesus to the scene.

0:01:57.880,0:02:05.020
You can say, "In the name of Jesus!“ and Jesus will come, if the state of your heart is at its best

0:02:05.020,0:02:10.440
because the Bible says, "Only faith pleases God“.

0:02:10.440,0:02:18.100
If only faith pleases God, what is the contact point of faith? Our heart.

0:02:18.100,0:02:24.100
Our heart is of faith. Our heart means spirit.

0:02:24.100,0:02:32.660
Our heart is the prayer room; our heart is the temple of God.

0:02:32.660,0:02:46.600
Today, our heart has become a conflict room between flesh and spirit,

0:02:46.600,0:02:56.300
a conflict room between for and against,

0:02:56.300,0:03:00.680
a conflict room between good and bad,

0:03:00.680,0:03:05.820
a conflict room between humility and pride

0:03:05.820,0:03:13.740
and a battleground between good and bad.

0:03:13.740,0:03:23.000
If your heart is at its best – here is Jesus.

0:03:23.000,0:03:27.180
You can bring Jesus to the scene; you can say, "In the name of Jesus“

0:03:27.180,0:03:30.560
and here is Jesus on the scene.

0:03:30.560,0:03:34.660
It is simple to know if you are praying.

0:03:34.660,0:03:39.600
It is simple to know if I am praying.

0:03:39.600,0:03:42.860
You can know if you are praying.

0:03:42.860,0:03:44.080
I can't hear you.

0:03:44.080,0:03:45.540
You can know if you are praying.

0:03:45.540,0:03:49.220
I can know if I am praying.

0:03:49.220,0:03:53.100
You are just deceiving yourself.

0:03:53.100,0:03:57.860
You will know if you are praying or talking to yourself.

0:03:57.860,0:03:59.260
How do we know?

0:03:59.260,0:04:03.960
We know by our heart, the state of our heart.

0:04:03.960,0:04:08.720
I can know if I am praying, and I can know if I am not praying.

0:04:08.720,0:04:10.740
So therefore, you can know.

0:04:10.740,0:04:15.780
But for you to say, you don’t know whether your prayer will be answered or not,

0:04:15.780,0:04:17.880
what kind of person are you?

0:04:17.880,0:04:21.680
Our heart is the landing place.

0:04:21.680,0:04:24.460
The state of our heart.

0:04:24.460,0:04:33.040
If our heart is at its best – that means, free spirit, free heart –

0:04:33.040,0:04:36.720
you can say, "Jesus“ - here is Jesus.

0:04:36.720,0:04:40.740
A free heart attracts Him.

0:04:40.740,0:04:45.440
Where you forget unforgiveness, forget everything behind you,

0:04:45.440,0:04:49.840
those who have offended you, those who have wronged you.

0:04:49.840,0:04:52.080
You leave all for God.

0:04:52.080,0:04:55.720
Then, you can come to God.

0:04:55.720,0:05:01.480
Can’t you hear what the Bible says: "Forgive us as we forgive those…“.

0:05:01.480,0:05:04.320
How do we forgive without a free heart?

0:05:04.320,0:05:09.560
Our Lord’s prayer says, "Forgive us, Lord, as we forgive those who sin against us“.

0:05:09.560,0:05:11.640
Is that not what the Bible says?

0:05:11.640,0:05:13.800
How can you forgive?

0:05:13.800,0:05:18.880
Brother, come here. How can you forgive without a free spirit?

0:05:18.880,0:05:20.280
Without a free spirit, you can’t forgive.

0:05:20.280,0:05:23.440
Without a free spirit – forget about the Holy Spirit yet.

0:05:23.440,0:05:26.460
Holy Spirit is too far. I’m talking to you now.

0:05:26.460,0:05:29.020
How can you now forgive without a free spirit?

0:05:29.020,0:05:30.220
I can’t forgive, sir.

0:05:30.220,0:05:32.220
That is all. It is not possible.

0:05:32.220,0:05:35.700
Because everything „Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit!“ – it is too far.

0:05:35.700,0:05:37.540
Talk to yourself, your heart.

0:05:37.540,0:05:44.040
You cannot forgive without a free heart.

0:05:44.040,0:05:47.900
Heart means our spirit. Our spirit means heart.

0:05:47.900,0:05:50.400
You cannot forgive.

0:05:50.400,0:05:59.340
"Forgive us, as we forgive those who sin against us“ – is that not the covenant we make?

0:05:59.340,0:06:02.420
Is that not your covenant? What is your covenant?

0:06:02.420,0:06:06.580
The greatest covenant we have made on earth as Christians:

0:06:06.580,0:06:11.040
We say to the Lord, "Forgive me, as I forgive those who sin against me“.

0:06:11.040,0:06:13.940
That is covenant but we have not fulfilled that covenant.

0:06:13.940,0:06:17.860
I will keep coming to church every day, keep praying to God.

0:06:17.860,0:06:20.660
That is the first covenant. The second covenant can follow.

0:06:20.660,0:06:26.660
The first covenant for Christians all over the world, to become a Christian:

0:06:26.660,0:06:31.780
"Forgive me, Lord, as I have forgiven those who have sinned against me".

0:06:31.780,0:06:34.380
Have you forgiven those who have sinned against you?

0:06:34.380,0:06:35.520
No.

0:06:35.520,0:06:39.140
That is why you are struggling, you don’t know whether your prayer is answered,

0:06:39.140,0:06:43.820
you don’t know whether you are praying to God.

0:06:43.820,0:06:47.540
There is no selection when it comes to forgiveness.

0:06:47.540,0:06:51.120
The wrong - the right.

0:06:51.120,0:06:53.200
Injustice - justice.

0:06:53.200,0:06:57.940
Forgive all.

0:06:57.940,0:07:10.340
Whether you are wrong or right, forgive.

0:07:10.340,0:07:13.900
Forgive us, as we forgive those who sin against us.

0:07:13.900,0:07:15.400
Say to yourself again.

0:07:15.400,0:07:17.880
Forgive us, as we forgive those who sin against us.

0:07:17.880,0:07:20.520
Is that not the covenant you have made?

0:07:20.520,0:07:22.400
Is that the first covenant?

0:07:22.400,0:07:26.920
That is the first covenant.

0:07:26.920,0:07:29.940
Before you come to God, that is the first.

0:07:29.940,0:07:35.720
When you open the Bible, the Lord’s prayer is the first to read.

0:07:35.720,0:07:37.660
But see what you are doing now.

0:07:37.660,0:07:44.460
You are a Christian today but yet, the first thing - one, two - you don’t know.

0:07:44.460,0:07:51.060
But you know 100, 1 million; you can count up to that.

0:07:51.060,0:07:54.020
Can somebody stand up there and tell me, what your duty now is.

0:07:54.020,0:07:58.000
Forgive me, as I forgive those who sin against me.

0:07:58.000,0:08:01.100
- What is your duty now?
- To forgive them.

0:08:01.100,0:08:03.700
- Who are the people?
- Anybody.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:08.640,0:08:12.980
Thank you, brother. My brother says, anybody.

0:08:12.980,0:08:14.860
My mummy, ok, come on.

0:08:14.860,0:08:18.180
My obligation is that I need to meditate on those words

0:08:18.180,0:08:21.680
and God will reveal more to me the people I need to forgive.

0:08:21.680,0:08:27.640
So what are the things you have promised initially as a Christian, before you became a Christian?

0:08:27.640,0:08:34.300
That I would forgive those who have trespassed against me, as Jesus has forgiven me.

0:08:34.300,0:08:36.220
Ok. What has been happening?

0:08:36.220,0:08:38.400
To be sincere, what has been happening?

0:08:38.400,0:08:40.820
I have been struggling to forgive.

0:08:40.820,0:08:44.140
Ok. Will Jesus struggle to bless you?

0:08:44.140,0:08:45.020
No.

0:08:45.020,0:08:47.580
That is it now. Jesus will struggle to bless you.

0:08:47.580,0:08:50.000
I will forgive now.

0:08:50.000,0:08:54.740
Help me, Jesus, so that I will forgive all those who have trespassed against me.

0:08:54.740,0:08:57.760
Why are you shaking now?

0:08:57.760,0:09:01.900
Your heart is troubled because of what?

0:09:01.900,0:09:03.320
Pain of the past.

0:09:03.320,0:09:07.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:07.940,0:09:11.520
She said her heart is shaking because of the pain of the past.

0:09:11.520,0:09:13.040
So you have seen now.

0:09:13.040,0:09:18.700
It is more painful to you than your enemy – unforgiveness;

0:09:18.700,0:09:22.920
it is more dangerous to you than your enemy.

0:09:22.920,0:09:35.980
Unforgiveness is more dangerous to me than my enemy.

0:09:35.980,0:09:40.740
Your enemy needs forgiveness for mercy

0:09:40.740,0:09:47.940
but you need forgiveness to [go to] Heaven, [for] eternal life.

0:09:47.940,0:09:53.980
Because if you die today without that forgiveness, you are going to hell.

0:09:53.980,0:09:59.560
You need it for eternal life but your enemy needs it for favour.

0:09:59.560,0:10:02.460
It is more dangerous to you.

0:10:02.460,0:10:04.820
So please, take care of yourself. Thank you.

0:10:04.820,0:10:06.460
Thank you very much.
