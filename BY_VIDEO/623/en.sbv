0:00:01.700,0:00:04.360
Good Morning, Church.

0:00:04.360,0:00:11.980
Viewers all over the world, when I say 'Church', I mean you. I mean everyone.

0:00:11.980,0:00:13.580
Thank you.

0:00:13.580,0:00:17.640
Hallelujah.

0:00:17.640,0:00:27.160
We received a lot of questions and I asked my people to bring these questions out

0:00:27.160,0:00:29.160
so that we can read them one by one.

0:00:29.160,0:00:33.900
After we have read them, we decided to pick from two sections -

0:00:33.900,0:00:36.460
one that is very touching.

0:00:36.460,0:00:42.220
There is a question concerning the message that is being shown on Emmanuel TV.

0:00:42.220,0:00:47.600
It was a man or was it a woman? It should be a woman because you know our women.

0:00:47.600,0:00:51.400
They normally want to know.

0:00:51.400,0:01:06.140
She was asking, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".

0:01:06.140,0:01:08.860
It's a very funny question.

0:01:08.860,0:01:11.360
It's very interesting.

0:01:11.360,0:01:26.320
She said, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".

0:01:26.320,0:01:27.280
Think about that.

0:01:27.280,0:01:29.100
This is very spiritual.

0:01:29.100,0:01:38.820
She said, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".

0:01:38.820,0:01:52.500
Tell your neighbour, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".

0:01:52.500,0:01:55.840
After looking at that question, I will not be able to go through it.

0:01:55.840,0:01:59.940
I just want to give you a summary of the importance of this question.

0:01:59.940,0:02:04.720
When you are praying - even before  you pray - you know the outcome, answer -

0:02:04.720,0:02:13.700
it's much greater than blessings.

0:02:13.700,0:02:18.500
Our mother that asked this question, please listen to that; for you to know how important it is.

0:02:18.500,0:02:24.320
To know that God hears us when we pray

0:02:24.320,0:02:32.920
is much greater than blessings, healing, deliverance and breakthough.

0:02:32.920,0:02:41.260
If you can hear from God, you will know when to pray and what to ask for.

0:02:41.260,0:02:42.980
But today how many of us...

0:02:42.980,0:02:45.760
You can't hear anything from God.

0:02:45.760,0:02:55.760
Because you say you are a Christian, that is why you pray.

0:02:55.760,0:02:59.980
I mean because you claim you are a Christian that is why you pray.

0:02:59.980,0:03:08.480
You have seen prayer as a tradition, national anthem; this is the way you see prayer.

0:03:08.480,0:03:13.220
Even coming to church, you see it as a tradition. On Sunday, I must go to church.

0:03:13.220,0:03:16.300
Not that anything attached to it.

0:03:16.300,0:03:27.200
Take note of this question: To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray.

0:03:27.200,0:03:35.180
It is much greater than anything.

0:03:35.180,0:03:36.940
When you want to pray, you say, "Heal me, heal me!"

0:03:36.940,0:03:44.540
No. It is much greater to know whether you will be healed.

0:03:44.540,0:03:47.380
"Bless me, oh Lord, bless me!"

0:03:47.380,0:03:50.440
There is something greater than that blessing.

0:03:50.440,0:03:56.160
If you know God will bless you, it is much greater than the blessing you are asking for.

0:03:56.160,0:03:59.660
"Deliver me, Lord, deliver me!"

0:03:59.660,0:04:01.980
There is something greater than that deliverance.

0:04:01.980,0:04:12.560
To know that God will deliver you is even greater than the blessing.

0:04:12.560,0:04:22.800
Tell your neighbour again, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray

0:04:22.800,0:04:35.120
is much greater than blessing, deliverance and healing".

0:04:35.120,0:04:39.480
How many of us know this today?

0:04:39.480,0:04:49.940
We always base our faith on our improvement after prayer.

0:04:49.940,0:04:55.060
You base your faith on your improvement after prayer.

0:04:55.060,0:04:59.100
When you want to pray, you say, "Jesus, heal me, Jesus heal me".

0:04:59.100,0:05:05.400
When you are not healed, you say, "I have no faith that is why Jesus did not heal me.

0:05:05.400,0:05:07.760
Jesus, heal me. Jesus, heal me".

0:05:07.760,0:05:14.060
When you experience little relief, you say, "That is the level of my faith".

0:05:14.060,0:05:17.340
Oh my God. If I am talking to you, let me see your hand!

0:05:17.340,0:05:21.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:21.260,0:05:24.700
You are having headache. You say, "Jesus, heal me, heal me".

0:05:24.700,0:05:27.940
When you are not healed, you say, "No faith".

0:05:27.940,0:05:33.200
You always base you faith on your  improvement after prayer.

0:05:33.200,0:05:38.580
Tell your neighbour, "You always base you faith on your  improvement after prayer".

0:05:38.580,0:05:40.040
That is it.

0:05:40.040,0:05:42.860
You always base you faith on your  improvement after prayer.

0:05:42.860,0:05:46.260
When you have not improved, you say, "I have no faith; that is why I have not improved".

0:05:46.260,0:05:52.720
When you have a little, you are praying you want to meet a customer who promised to give you money.

0:05:52.720,0:05:55.700
As a Christian, you now say, "Lord...".

0:05:55.700,0:06:00.920
You have been fasting for three days because you want to meet the man who promised to give you money.

0:06:00.920,0:06:08.080
Fasting for three days; praying, "Lord, touch his heart".

0:06:08.080,0:06:12.400
Now, it is time to go and meet the man.

0:06:12.400,0:06:17.680
You just get to the door and he says, "Please who is knocking on the door?"

0:06:17.680,0:06:18.860
You say, "I am the one".

0:06:18.860,0:06:22.440
He says, "Please I dont want to hear your voice".

0:06:22.440,0:06:30.580
You say "Ah, I have no faith".

0:06:30.580,0:06:35.000
When you continue to base your faith on your improvement after prayer,

0:06:35.000,0:06:44.280
you will soon become unbelievers.

0:06:44.280,0:06:50.940
Because that is the trick satan is using now; a common trick today,

0:06:50.940,0:06:54.700
a common strategy and tactic of satan.

0:06:54.700,0:06:57.640
He has been using it to draw you closer to him.

0:06:57.640,0:07:03.320
Each time you say, "Jesus, I am hungry" - instead of you to know that

0:07:03.320,0:07:08.500
when He doesn't give you food instantly, it does not mean you are not a child of God.

0:07:08.500,0:07:12.300
When He doesn't give you food instantly, it does not mean you have no faith.

0:07:12.300,0:07:16.020
But you say, "I'm not a child of God that is why the food is not given to me".

0:07:16.020,0:07:19.860
Now because of that you begin to see Jesus in a bad light.

0:07:19.860,0:07:28.060
Then, you'll now begin to see satan; you are going back to satan.

0:07:28.060,0:07:32.780
This is what turned you to what you are today.

0:07:32.780,0:07:37.320
You are what you are because you base your faith on your improvement after prayer.

0:07:37.320,0:07:41.640
Tell you neighbour, "You are what you are today because you base your faith on your improvement after prayer".

0:07:41.640,0:07:45.060
I can't hear you.

0:07:45.060,0:08:00.100
Say "I am what I am because I base my faith on my improvement after prayer".

0:08:00.100,0:08:06.560
You keep drawing closer to Satan, and your Christian life keeps going down.

0:08:06.560,0:08:10.160
You keep counting how many failures you have in prayer.

0:08:10.160,0:08:13.400
I asked for this; I didn't receive it.

0:08:13.400,0:08:20.740
I asked for promotion; I received a sack letter.

0:08:20.740,0:08:26.300
Now, I am asking God to give me another job; I am jobless now.

0:08:26.300,0:08:30.540
By the time you now count the number of failures in your prayer,

0:08:30.540,0:08:33.260
you are about to begin to pray to satan.

0:08:33.260,0:08:37.900
You go to witchdoctors, spiritualists.

0:08:37.900,0:08:43.140
You now believe that maybe you have to do the two together.

0:08:43.140,0:08:47.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:47.020,0:08:49.020
You have to do the two together.

0:08:49.020,0:08:55.980
You now begin to listen to the voice of your neighbours who say, "Ah, where is your car?"

0:08:55.980,0:09:01.060
He is making jest of you. He knows you have a jeep you normally ride to church.

0:09:01.060,0:09:05.520
He now sees you with a Bible without a car, walking on the street.

0:09:05.520,0:09:09.020
"Oga, where is your car?"

0:09:09.020,0:09:12.700
"It is with the mechanics".

0:09:12.700,0:09:16.160
"Ok, ok. Because I have seen you...".

0:09:16.160,0:09:21.800
For how long will you continue to tell your neighbour, it's with the mechanics.

0:09:21.800,0:09:25.860
At the end of the day, you'll open the door, open your window,

0:09:25.860,0:09:31.400
look around. When your neighbour is not around, you run.

0:09:31.400,0:09:35.820
Your big Bible now turns to a small Bible that you can put in your pocket.

0:09:35.820,0:09:38.780
They will not know where you are going.

0:09:38.780,0:09:44.700
You are what you are because you base your faith on your improvement.

0:09:44.700,0:09:48.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:48.500,0:09:52.540
You now have a small Bible that you can put inside your pocket.

0:09:52.540,0:09:57.080
When you do not carry a Bible, your neighbour cannot ask you where you are going.

0:09:57.080,0:10:01.180
Sometimes, you wear a T-shirt and put your suit inside (a bag).

0:10:01.180,0:10:03.320
I don't want them to know where I am going.

0:10:03.320,0:10:07.260
These two issues are very important that the woman asked me.

0:10:07.260,0:10:11.700
I know that she is being used mightily by God in asking me,

0:10:11.700,0:10:26.380
"To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray is much greater than anything".

0:10:26.380,0:10:31.580
If you know you hear from God after prayer, you will not be disappointed

0:10:31.580,0:10:36.840
because when you come to Him, He will tell you what you want to ask for is not His will.

0:10:36.840,0:10:39.780
We always ask for something against  God's will.

0:10:39.780,0:10:43.240
If you pray according to His will, you will receive.

0:10:43.240,0:10:46.940
Look at me. I am having this.

0:10:46.940,0:10:48.760
It is my intention to give it to you.

0:10:48.760,0:10:52.160
And you now come to me, "T.B. Joshua, give me". I will give it to you.

0:10:52.160,0:10:55.100
But this one is not for you.

0:10:55.100,0:10:58.520
You now come to me and begin to pray, "T.B. Joshua, give me".

0:10:58.520,0:11:01.860
Ah. It is not for you. If I give it to you, it will destroy you.

0:11:01.860,0:11:04.300
If I give it to you, it will terminate your life.

0:11:04.300,0:11:08.740
If I give it to you, it will take you away from Christian life.

0:11:08.740,0:11:10.740
He will not give it to you.

0:11:10.740,0:11:14.900
Sometimes, those prayers are meant to strengthen your desire.

0:11:14.900,0:11:18.060
Unanswered prayers are meant to strengthen your desire;

0:11:18.060,0:11:22.660
they are meant to stop you awhile in order to prepare you better.

0:11:22.660,0:11:25.300
They are not unanswered prayers.

0:11:25.300,0:11:28.760
They seem unanswered but they are not.

0:11:28.760,0:11:33.440
To base your prayer on your improvement after prayer is nonsense.

0:11:33.440,0:11:39.120
You say, "Jesus, give me bread" and you are not given, you feel faithless.

0:11:39.120,0:11:40.620
I don't have faith.

0:11:40.620,0:11:45.200
And that will not encourage you to continue striving.

0:11:45.200,0:11:53.360
Today, we seem to listen to what people complain and pray over it,

0:11:53.360,0:11:57.620
instead of listening to what God says we should pray for.

0:11:57.620,0:12:03.660
We should listen to God, "In the name of Jesus, this man is asking for prayer -

0:12:03.660,0:12:07.340
what kind of prayer will I offer for him?"

0:12:07.340,0:12:11.300
But since we cannot reach God and we have no access to God,

0:12:11.300,0:12:13.980
we tend to listen to what you people demand for.

0:12:13.980,0:12:17.820
You ask for bread - "In the name of Jesus, God, give bread".

0:12:17.820,0:12:20.240
"God, give him bread."

0:12:20.240,0:12:23.260
Instead of asking God.

0:12:23.260,0:12:24.800
This man is asking for prayer.

0:12:24.800,0:12:28.440
It may be biscuit that God wants us to give to this man instead of bread.

0:12:28.440,0:12:31.860
And that biscuit will contain the bread you are asking for.

0:12:31.860,0:12:37.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:37.600,0:12:41.200
If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.

0:12:41.200,0:12:45.280
These are the challenges we are having today.

0:12:45.280,0:12:50.320
What you do today - "Man of God, pray for me".

0:12:50.320,0:12:57.500
Even some of us will go ahead to ask, "What is your problem?"

0:12:57.500,0:13:00.040
"My marital life is destroyed."

0:13:00.040,0:13:09.740
"Ok. Father, Father, bring this man and this woman together. Let them come together.

0:13:09.740,0:13:15.320
What you have joined together, no one should put asunder, in Jesus' name."

0:13:15.320,0:13:26.620
No answer because we listened to the patient instead of listening to God.

0:13:26.620,0:13:30.740
We cannot order God; God orders us.

0:13:30.740,0:13:33.120
But today, we order God.

0:13:33.120,0:13:39.660
By listening to the patient - "I have marital problem" - and I start praying over that marital problem,

0:13:39.660,0:13:43.480
we are ordering God.

0:13:43.480,0:13:47.840
How do we know that this is the will of God for the woman?

0:13:47.840,0:13:53.240
We should pray according to His will.

0:13:53.240,0:14:00.340
When you are not praying according to His will, you are deceiving yourself.

0:14:00.340,0:14:04.260
When we pray according to His will, He answers us.

0:14:04.260,0:14:11.040
We need to ask God's will over issues.

0:14:11.040,0:14:15.680
You are very poor, you have debt and you run to me,

0:14:15.680,0:14:22.380
"Man of God, I have debt, I have no money. Pray for me. I have debt. I have no house".

0:14:22.380,0:14:30.660
Now, instead of asking God - God's will over the matter -

0:14:30.660,0:14:42.840
and God's will may be, "Pray for the man against sickness",

0:14:42.840,0:14:45.740
not even what the man asked for,

0:14:45.740,0:14:49.920
that prayer alone will solve all other problems.

0:14:49.920,0:14:55.960
But we go ahead to pray according to the man's will.

0:14:55.960,0:15:00.320
The man demanded for breakthrough and we begin to pray, "Breakthrough, breakthrough".

0:15:00.320,0:15:02.800
You cannot order God; God orders us.

0:15:02.800,0:15:07.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:07.200,0:15:14.940
And we too - members, subjects, patients - you people have constituted temptations.

0:15:14.940,0:15:19.200
You tempt your pastor; you tempt everyone because you are ignorant.

0:15:19.200,0:15:21.340
What do you expect from an ignorant person?

0:15:21.340,0:15:24.600
There's nothing an ignorant person cannot do

0:15:24.600,0:15:28.700
because you don't even know 1,2,3 in things of the spirit.

0:15:28.700,0:15:29.680
Tempter.

0:15:29.680,0:15:35.360
When you just get to your pastor, "Man of God, my business is not moving".

0:15:35.360,0:15:37.680
Now, you are a tempter.

0:15:37.680,0:15:43.080
Man of God himself - ignorant.

0:15:43.080,0:15:46.680
He does not even know how to go about it.

0:15:46.680,0:15:52.940
He wants to pray over your business instead of asking God - God's will.

0:15:52.940,0:15:56.960
When we pray according to His will, He answers us.

0:15:56.960,0:15:59.320
Not according to your will.

0:15:59.320,0:16:02.360
Not according to the will of the patient.

0:16:02.360,0:16:07.140
This is quiet different from a medical issue.

0:16:07.140,0:16:11.120
When you have a problem and you go to the doctor, you help the doctor.

0:16:11.120,0:16:13.680
Oftentimes, we help the doctor. How?

0:16:13.680,0:16:17.440
You say, "I have a problem, doctor".

0:16:17.440,0:16:19.800
He will ask you, "What is your problem?"

0:16:19.800,0:16:21.280
"Chronic headache."

0:16:21.280,0:16:23.120
Now, you are helping the doctor.

0:16:23.120,0:16:30.600
He will now focus on that X-ray to see your head.

0:16:30.600,0:16:34.340
But if your doctor cannot find anything, he will still go an extra mile

0:16:34.340,0:16:39.500
to check other faculties or organs of your system,

0:16:39.500,0:16:41.260
to know where the problem comes from.

0:16:41.260,0:16:45.900
If he cannot find the problem, he will say, "Ah, I cannot trace anything now".

0:16:45.900,0:16:49.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:49.340,0:16:51.340
Which is quite different from God.

0:16:51.340,0:16:55.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:55.020,0:17:03.060
All of us have become a tempter to God because of our ignorance.

0:17:03.060,0:17:08.360
When the name of Jesus has not answered, we say, "It doesn't work for me".

0:17:08.360,0:17:11.860
And the name of Jesus is alive.

0:17:11.860,0:17:17.360
When we call that name and he has not answered us, we think that it doesn't work for us.

0:17:17.360,0:17:24.400
Some ignorant people would say, "No, he is not alive. There is nothing like that".

0:17:24.400,0:17:27.640
But those who want to be mine will say, "It doesn't work for me".

0:17:27.640,0:17:30.620
It means they still believe that it works for some people.

0:17:30.620,0:17:38.360
When you meet your pastor tomorrow for an issue, how do you approach it now?

0:17:38.360,0:17:44.220
You say, "Pastor, my business is not moving. Pray for me".

0:17:44.220,0:17:48.120
You have become a tempter; tempting the pastor.

0:17:48.120,0:17:52.320
The pastor too is not supposed to pray over that issue.

0:17:52.320,0:17:54.880
He is supposed to ask God - God's will.

0:17:54.880,0:18:01.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:01.300,0:18:10.180
Your business not moving may be to preserve you for some days or months.

0:18:10.180,0:18:15.500
God can use your business, the slowing down of your business, to preserve you.

0:18:15.500,0:18:20.660
He can use the failure of your business to preserve you.

0:18:20.660,0:18:22.440
He will preserve you.

0:18:22.440,0:18:26.780
If your business is moving and you are travelling all over, maybe something would have happened to you.

0:18:26.780,0:18:29.740
Maybe you would have ended your life suddently just like that.

0:18:29.740,0:18:33.040
But instead of allowing your business to move and you ending your life,

0:18:33.040,0:18:38.420
He will slow down the business so that you will not be able to travel to where satan will catch you.

0:18:38.420,0:18:40.580
If I am talking to you, let me see your hand!

0:18:40.580,0:18:44.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:44.640,0:18:54.660
If you are destined for Heaven and Heaven is your home, God has a way of stopping you.

0:18:54.660,0:19:01.940
Even if you live in the clubhouse 24/7 and you are in the clubhouse dancing naked

0:19:01.940,0:19:07.360
and do all sorts of things, and Heaven is your home, He has a way of stopping you.

0:19:07.360,0:19:11.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:11.920,0:19:16.540
He has a way of stopping you so that you can inherit the Kingdom.

0:19:16.540,0:19:20.880
He can use any foolish thing; He can use anything.

0:19:20.880,0:19:25.940
He can use failure; he can even use cancer.

0:19:25.940,0:19:30.620
When you dance naked, have cancer and get to the doctor, the doctor says, "This is cancer.

0:19:30.620,0:19:33.440
You have seven days left to spend on this earth".

0:19:33.440,0:19:36.820
You say, "Doctor, what will I do?" Nobody wants to die.

0:19:36.820,0:19:37.920
"What will I do?"

0:19:37.920,0:19:40.980
He says, "You smoke too much. Where are you working?"

0:19:40.980,0:19:42.360
"I'm in the clubhouse."

0:19:42.360,0:19:48.420
"Ah, stop that. Stop smoking. Ok? Look onto God."

0:19:48.420,0:19:50.880
"If I do that, I will not die?"

0:19:50.880,0:19:53.580
"You will not die. Your life will still be prolonged."

0:19:53.580,0:19:54.840
"Ok."

0:19:54.840,0:19:58.520
You stop smoking, you stop nonsense, you come back.

0:19:58.520,0:20:04.520
When you come back - what kind of cancer? Your cancer is not like others!

0:20:04.520,0:20:10.700
Those for whom God uses those foolish things to preserve, their own foolish thing is not like others.

0:20:10.700,0:20:19.700
Their own sickness is to kill or destroy them but yours is to preserve you.

0:20:19.700,0:20:22.940
Are you getting me?

0:20:22.940,0:20:28.380
When I say foolish things, I mean all kind of nonsense like cancer, sickness, poverty

0:20:28.380,0:20:32.680
failure, embarassment, temptation.

0:20:32.680,0:20:41.220
If you are destined for Heaven and Heaven is your home at last, you cannot lose it.

0:20:41.220,0:20:53.620
When you are going astray, He will use anything to stop you in order not to lose Heaven.

0:20:53.620,0:21:00.100
Listen. He can use death. You hear of people dying suddently.

0:21:00.100,0:21:05.040
Sometimes, He uses death to stop the life of that person.

0:21:05.040,0:21:09.960
Whilst that person is about to die, he will say, "God, I am sorry".

0:21:09.960,0:21:12.200
He will give the chance to say that.

0:21:12.200,0:21:19.800
"I am sorry."

0:21:19.800,0:21:25.920
He may give two, three or four days, or even just an hour or second for you to say, "I'm sorry" -

0:21:25.920,0:21:28.000
he is going to Heaven.

0:21:28.000,0:21:33.440
But you people will be shouting, "Heee, he died at a young age. Why did this happen?

0:21:33.440,0:21:36.780
Why should all these things happen? This satanic world! This is it".

0:21:36.780,0:21:39.140
Sit down there. You will meet him in Heaven.

0:21:39.140,0:21:46.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:46.060,0:21:50.980
Sit down and think about your business, the challenges you are facing now.

0:21:50.980,0:21:53.260
It is better that you change.

0:21:53.260,0:21:56.100
Heaven is your home.

0:21:56.100,0:22:01.260
You say, "My business is not going well" and you begin to attribute it to satan.

0:22:01.260,0:22:04.520
Who is satan in your life when you are a child of God?

0:22:04.520,0:22:07.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:07.320,0:22:10.960
My business is not moving. I have debts.

0:22:10.960,0:22:14.320
Look at me from up down; look at what's happening to me.

0:22:14.320,0:22:19.020
This is an embarrassment. You start thinking that it's satan who is behind it.

0:22:19.020,0:22:24.540
Which satan when you are destined for Heaven and you are going astray?

0:22:24.540,0:22:27.860
In order not to lose Heaven, something has to stop you

0:22:27.860,0:22:32.020
so that you can look inward and do the right thing.

0:22:32.020,0:22:38.440
If your spirit is telling you that you are destined for Heaven, let me see your hand.

0:22:38.440,0:22:43.980
You will know inside you, the indwelling grace is telling you that you are destined for Heaven.

0:22:43.980,0:22:45.700
No matter - you are destined for Heaven.

0:22:45.700,0:22:48.100
Let me see your hand.

0:22:48.100,0:22:50.540
Rise up!

0:22:50.540,0:22:52.620
My lifetime.

0:22:52.620,0:22:54.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:54.620,0:22:59.240
My lifetime

0:22:59.240,0:23:07.200
I will give God my lifetime

0:23:07.200,0:23:11.980
My lifetime

0:23:11.980,0:23:17.000
I will give God my lifetime

0:23:17.000,0:23:26.780
If I give God my lifetime

0:23:26.780,0:23:33.920
He will take care of me

0:23:33.920,0:23:41.000
He will never ever let me down

0:23:41.000,0:23:46.500
I will give God my lifetime

0:23:46.500,0:23:54.640
My lifetime

0:23:54.640,0:24:00.120
I will give God my lifetime

0:24:00.120,0:24:08.480
My lifetime

0:24:08.480,0:24:14.020
I will give God my lifetime

0:24:14.020,0:24:22.340
If I give God my lifetime

0:24:22.340,0:24:29.400
He will take care of me

0:24:29.400,0:24:36.280
He will never ever let me down

0:24:36.280,0:24:43.280
I will give God my lifetime

0:24:43.280,0:24:46.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:46.720,0:24:49.440
You may be seated.

0:24:49.440,0:24:55.040
That you have sickness, does not mean you are not a favourite.

0:24:55.040,0:25:08.280
Don't ever judge your Christian life by your situation.

0:25:08.280,0:25:21.040
In the same vein, don't ever base your faith on your improvement after prayer.

0:25:21.040,0:25:28.120
Repeat after me: "Don't ever judge your Christian life by your situation.

0:25:28.120,0:25:42.180
In the same vein, don't ever base your faith on your improvement after prayer".

0:25:42.180,0:25:46.200
Soldier on - you are a Christian.

0:25:46.200,0:25:51.940
You pray and you are expecting something and you are not receiving that thing - soldier on!

0:25:51.940,0:25:56.360
That should be the reason why you should love Jesus the more.

0:25:56.360,0:26:01.520
Jesus said, "If you honour me when your situation seems to be very hopeless,

0:26:01.520,0:26:03.760
I will honour you mightily!"

0:26:03.760,0:26:07.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:07.360,0:26:13.520
Tell your neighbour, "If you honour me when your situation seems hopeless,

0:26:13.520,0:26:16.460
He said, I will honour you mightily!"

0:26:16.460,0:26:18.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:18.860,0:26:24.820
When a situation happens ... people around say, "Are you a Christian?

0:26:24.820,0:26:26.940
Why are all these things happening to you?"

0:26:26.940,0:26:31.460
If in the midst this, you start to honour Jesus and say, "Yes, I am a Christian"

0:26:31.460,0:26:36.000
and you love Jesus the more, the reward is greater.

0:26:36.000,0:26:39.420
When there is no testimony and you honour Him, you are dancing,

0:26:39.420,0:26:43.820
you honour Him even more than those that have testimony - the greater is your reward!

0:26:43.820,0:26:50.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:50.760,0:26:55.580
These are the things satan uses to destroy the life of people today.

0:26:55.580,0:27:00.160
Look at the question this woman is asking me:

0:27:00.160,0:27:08.780
"To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray".

0:27:08.780,0:27:20.920
I have answered the woman: "... is much greater than the blessing we are seeking".

0:27:20.920,0:27:24.920
How do you learn this now?

0:27:24.920,0:27:29.740
To learn these things - these are the things I am giving you now - the experiences;

0:27:29.740,0:27:32.760
what Satan is using on the outside to deceive you.

0:27:32.760,0:27:39.140
When you have sickness, he now says, "Aha, he is sick now!"

0:27:39.140,0:27:40.160
He is happy.

0:27:40.160,0:27:42.840
Do you know why Satan is happy when you are sick?

0:27:42.840,0:27:48.200
Because he knows that you will begin to confess him.

0:27:48.200,0:27:50.000
How do we confess satan?

0:27:50.000,0:27:54.380
We confess satan when we start running to spiritualists.

0:27:54.380,0:28:00.500
"Hehehe, no food on the table!" Satan says, "Hehe, this is what I want".

0:28:00.500,0:28:02.240
He is waiting. Why is he laughing?

0:28:02.240,0:28:05.700
He is laughing because he knows what you will begin to confess.

0:28:05.700,0:28:09.440
"Church? No, I am not going to church."

0:28:09.440,0:28:14.260
You are confessing satan.

0:28:14.260,0:28:16.060
Reading Bible - hm.

0:28:16.060,0:28:21.140
You normally pray three times a day. You reduce it to just once.

0:28:21.140,0:28:25.480
It is confessing satan.

0:28:25.480,0:28:32.400
He knows he is getting to you gradually, gradually, gradually

0:28:32.400,0:28:42.100
and he knows that soon, you will turn to him and worship him.

0:28:42.100,0:28:44.100
Thank You.
