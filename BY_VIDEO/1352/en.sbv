0:00:00.000,0:00:04.520
Greet your neighbour, "Emmanuel!" (God With  Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:04.520,0:00:08.520
Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:08.520,0:00:12.640
Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:12.640,0:00:17.060
Give the neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:17.060,0:00:21.720
Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:21.720,0:00:32.140
And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:32.140,0:00:36.300
God is with us.

0:00:36.300,0:00:40.080
You are welcome once again to the presence of God

0:00:40.080,0:00:45.560
and you may have your seats in Jesus' name.

0:00:45.560,0:00:50.500
It is such a privilege to be in the presence of God

0:00:50.500,0:00:57.520
because here in the presence of God, healing, deliverance, breakthrough are just like breathing.

0:00:57.520,0:01:01.320
As you have entered into the presence of God today

0:01:01.320,0:01:04.740
and you are joining  us live on Emmanuel TV,

0:01:04.740,0:01:13.060
we know that your case will not escape the anointing of God.

0:01:13.060,0:01:15.840
So let me just quickly ask you a question.

0:01:15.840,0:01:21.380
You can answer the question from wherever you are in the church auditorium.

0:01:21.380,0:01:24.320
The question I want to ask you is this:

0:01:24.320,0:01:27.840
What are you here for today?

0:01:27.840,0:01:32.360
I want you to shout it out wherever your are: What are you here for today?

0:01:32.360,0:01:37.360
Ok, I'm hearing deliverance, salvation - very good.

0:01:37.360,0:01:40.120
Did someone say breakthrough?

0:01:40.120,0:01:42.500
Are sure you are here for breakthrough?

0:01:42.500,0:01:45.900
Ok. I heard someone say promotion.

0:01:45.900,0:01:48.380
Ok, now next question:

0:01:48.380,0:01:51.760
Who is the One who can give you these things? Let me hear you.

0:01:51.760,0:01:53.160
[Jesus!]

0:01:53.160,0:01:54.940
I'm not sure. Can you say that again.

0:01:54.940,0:01:56.860
[Jesus!]

0:01:56.860,0:02:02.520
Wonderful, you agree with me that what you are here for, Jesus is the One who will give you.

0:02:02.520,0:02:03.780
Excellent!

0:02:03.780,0:02:10.120
We know that whatever you receive here today will be from our Lord Jesus Christ,

0:02:10.120,0:02:12.180
through the Holy Spirit.

0:02:12.180,0:02:16.600
It is not man's plan; it is not by our own effort.

0:02:16.600,0:02:19.600
It is not by our human intelligence or wisdom.

0:02:19.600,0:02:26.720
It is by the grace of God that you will receive what you will receive today.

0:02:26.720,0:02:31.480
The Holy Spirit uses the Word of God to bring healing, to bring deliverance

0:02:31.480,0:02:34.980
to bring blessing, to bring peace into our hearts.

0:02:34.980,0:02:38.220
So, let me ask you the next question:

0:02:38.220,0:02:43.600
Is the Holy Spirit welcome into your heart?

0:02:43.600,0:02:46.360
I didn't hear you very clearly. Let me ask you again.

0:02:46.360,0:02:50.520
Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?

0:02:50.520,0:02:53.880
Ok, we believe that yes is a genuine one.

0:02:53.880,0:03:00.200
Because I want to try and paint a picture that I believe can help you relate to this truth.

0:03:00.200,0:03:10.340
Just imagine that a very influential or important person is coming to visit you in your house.

0:03:10.340,0:03:16.980
Let's say maybe for example the president of your country or someone you know in society

0:03:16.980,0:03:22.420
that is very influential, someone that's very well known is coming to visit you in your house,

0:03:22.420,0:03:23.680
coming to eat with you.

0:03:23.680,0:03:25.880
Let me ask you this question. I want someone to answer.

0:03:25.880,0:03:29.060
How will you prepare your home to receive such a person?

0:03:29.060,0:03:31.720
If you would like to answer the question, just raise your hand.

0:03:31.720,0:03:33.640
Ok, our sister here has raised her hand.

0:03:33.640,0:03:36.920
I will clean up my house and put everything in place.

0:03:36.920,0:03:40.260
Ok, I hope you listened to what she said. She said she will clean up the house.

0:03:40.260,0:03:42.380
Tell your neighbour, "Clean up the house".

0:03:42.380,0:03:43.760
Ok, what else would you do?

0:03:43.760,0:03:47.480
I will make sure there is nothing on the ground, everything is fine.

0:03:47.480,0:03:49.960
Everything looks beautiful. Everything looks spick and span.

0:03:49.960,0:03:50.700
Yes.

0:03:50.700,0:03:56.220
Ok. If you are going to prepare food for the influential person, what kind of food will you prepare?

0:03:56.220,0:03:59.420
The best food I like to eat.

0:03:59.420,0:04:03.640
The best food - ok, what is your best food?

0:04:03.640,0:04:07.860
Rice, baked beans and chicken.

0:04:07.860,0:04:12.340
The president is in for a very special dish.  Ok, what kind of rice?

0:04:12.340,0:04:13.860
Baked rice.

0:04:13.860,0:04:17.180
Wow! I hope you see where we are going here.

0:04:17.180,0:04:19.100
Our sister is saying the truth.

0:04:19.100,0:04:22.580
If you are going to receive a very important person into your house,

0:04:22.580,0:04:26.220
you will prepare very especially for that.

0:04:26.220,0:04:30.780
You will clean up everywhere. You will make sure that everywhere is beautiful.

0:04:30.780,0:04:36.040
You will make sure there is no dirt or things around. You want to make a good impression.

0:04:36.040,0:04:42.500
You want to impress the person that is coming to visit you. Is that not right?

0:04:42.500,0:04:45.600
You want to make sure the person is happy when they leave.

0:04:45.600,0:04:49.080
That they have a good impression about the visit to your house.

0:04:49.080,0:04:55.780
I want to relate this to the way and manner we often approach the Holy Spirit.

0:04:55.780,0:05:01.800
Today in our Christian lives, we often approach the Holy Spirit as a very special guest

0:05:01.800,0:05:07.460
that we want to welcome into our house for a short period and then He goes.

0:05:07.460,0:05:11.460
When we want to welcome Him, we quickly make sure we prepare everywhere.

0:05:11.460,0:05:14.320
We clean here, clean there, make sure this is fine.

0:05:14.320,0:05:17.100
We quickly stop anything that we know is not in line with Him,

0:05:17.100,0:05:22.000
because we want Him to come, we want to impress Him, we want to receive something from Him.

0:05:22.000,0:05:25.420
But let me tell you a valuable and an important truth today.

0:05:25.420,0:05:34.060
The Holy Spirit is not just here to visit your heart; He is here to make His home in your heart.

0:05:34.060,0:05:38.920
There is a difference - a visitor can come and go.

0:05:38.920,0:05:44.000
After the visitor has come, the mess that you cleared up, you can get messy again.

0:05:44.000,0:05:46.960
You say, "I have made a good impression, I have impressed my visitor".

0:05:46.960,0:05:55.140
But the Holy Spirit wants to make His home in your heart, to dwell in you,

0:05:55.140,0:05:59.420
to live in you permanently - not to come and go.

0:05:59.420,0:06:01.620
So I ask you the question again:

0:06:01.620,0:06:08.940
Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?

0:06:08.940,0:06:13.780
Or do you just quickly clean up to impress Him?

0:06:13.780,0:06:18.180
Because you want healing, you want breakthrough, you want promotion,

0:06:18.180,0:06:20.620
you have a challenge that you are facing that is beyond you.

0:06:20.620,0:06:23.480
You say, "Let me run to church, I need this from God".

0:06:23.480,0:06:29.320
But you are just putting up an impression to try and woo the Holy Spirit to give you,

0:06:29.320,0:06:36.800
whereas you are not ready to really welcome Him to live in your heart.

0:06:36.800,0:06:43.760
Prophet T.B. Joshua says, the Holy Spirit may convict us, may operate through us.

0:06:43.760,0:06:54.860
He may speak through us but He cannot make His home in our heart unless we are recreated,

0:06:54.860,0:06:59.840
unless our hearts are conducive for Him to stay.

0:06:59.840,0:07:03.260
Many people today say they want the Holy Spirit to come,

0:07:03.260,0:07:07.780
they want the benefits, the results, the fruits of the Holy Spirit

0:07:07.780,0:07:13.000
but in  their private lives, behind closed doors, when they are back at home,

0:07:13.000,0:07:18.560
they still engage in things that grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:07:18.560,0:07:28.220
The Holy Spirit goes where He is desired, not just where He is needed

0:07:28.220,0:07:32.000
because we all need the Holy Spirit.

0:07:32.000,0:07:37.880
Everyone needs Him; the question is: Do you really desire Him?

0:07:37.880,0:07:42.100
We need the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, who are we?

0:07:42.100,0:07:47.880
Our Christian lives depend on the Holy Spirit.

0:07:47.880,0:07:53.300
No one can say no to sin and yes to righteousness without the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:07:53.300,0:07:58.500
No on can say, "Jesus is Lord" effectively without the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:07:58.500,0:08:05.000
Without the Holy Spirit, our church service today is just a religious occasion - just a gathering.

0:08:05.000,0:08:09.760
Without the help of the Holy Spirit, our prayers are just mere words.

0:08:09.760,0:08:16.760
Without the help of the Holy Spirit, we can fast and fast but we are just going on a hunger strike.

0:08:16.760,0:08:22.840
Without the Holy Spirit, this message I'm preaching, this sermon is just a motivational talk.

0:08:22.840,0:08:27.620
It can inspire you, it can charge you emotionally but cannot change you spiritually.

0:08:27.620,0:08:31.380
You can only become spiritual by the help of the Holy Spirit

0:08:31.380,0:08:38.980
because God is Spirit and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.

0:08:38.980,0:08:45.920
Without the Holy Spirit, this Christianity that we claim is nothing more that religion -

0:08:45.920,0:08:48.720
serving a God we don't know.

0:08:48.720,0:08:52.020
Without the Holy Spirit.

0:08:52.020,0:08:54.480
So I ask you again:

0:08:54.480,0:09:04.500
Is the Holy Spirit welcome to live in your heart?

0:09:04.500,0:09:11.880
The human spirit fails unless  the Holy Spirit fills.

0:09:11.880,0:09:15.940
And this brings us to the title of today's message:

0:09:15.940,0:09:19.280
WELCOME THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:09:19.280,0:09:28.680
Tell your neighbour: WELCOME THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:09:28.680,0:09:37.140
Now, let's quickly turn in our Bibles to the proof text for today's message.

0:09:37.140,0:09:48.320
That is Ephesians 4:30-32 and it reads thus:

0:09:48.320,0:09:54.880
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,

0:09:54.880,0:09:58.420
with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."

0:09:58.420,0:09:59.540
Verse 31.

0:09:59.540,0:10:05.340
"Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger, brawling and slander,

0:10:05.340,0:10:07.860
along with every form of malice.

0:10:07.860,0:10:12.080
Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other

0:10:12.080,0:10:15.260
just as in Christ God forgave you."

0:10:15.260,0:10:18.700
Now, let's quickly as well turn to the Book of Romans.

0:10:18.700,0:10:23.160
Romans 8:5-6.

0:10:23.160,0:10:25.420
And it reads thus:

0:10:25.420,0:10:34.240
"Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires;

0:10:34.240,0:10:42.780
but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their mind set on what the Spirit desires.

0:10:42.780,0:10:55.460
The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace."

0:10:55.460,0:11:01.680
Prophet T.B. Joshua says and he said this from his many experiences travelling

0:11:01.680,0:11:07.000
all over the world ministering to pastors, ministers, people in crusades all around the world.

0:11:07.000,0:11:08.100
He said that:

0:11:08.100,0:11:18.300
"I have witnessed the Holy Spirit descend on many people but He does not remain -

0:11:18.300,0:11:26.020
I mean, He does not stay when He is grieved."

0:11:26.020,0:11:31.720
How do we grieve the Holy Spirit?

0:11:31.720,0:11:35.640
I'm going to explain this to you in four very simple points,

0:11:35.640,0:11:39.780
and I encourage you to examine your life in the light of these truths.

0:11:39.780,0:11:41.020
How do we grieve the Holy Spirit?

0:11:41.020,0:11:47.260
Number 1: We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride.

0:11:47.260,0:11:56.140
Number 2: We grieve the Holy Spirit when we hold a grudge against someone.

0:11:56.140,0:12:04.240
Number 3: We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.

0:12:04.240,0:12:07.120
And number 4:

0:12:07.120,0:12:18.600
We grieve the Holy Spirit by forcing Him to see and hear what is opposed to His will.

0:12:18.600,0:12:20.420
I'm going to go through one by one with you.

0:12:20.420,0:12:25.700
Number 1: We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride.

0:12:25.700,0:12:29.020
Pride. What is pride?

0:12:29.020,0:12:33.220
When you consider yourself more than God,

0:12:33.220,0:12:38.260
when you care more about your ego than your conscience,

0:12:38.260,0:12:43.880
when you care more about your image than your destiny,

0:12:43.880,0:12:47.760
when you care more about your ambition than your salvation.

0:12:47.760,0:12:50.520
Pride.

0:12:50.520,0:12:54.780
This pride is expressed in many ways. Let me just give you one or two ways which

0:12:54.780,0:12:58.160
you can identify someone that demonstrates that pride.

0:12:58.160,0:13:01.420
Have you observed that in life and in society in general

0:13:01.420,0:13:05.700
it is very common for people when they succeed and do well,

0:13:05.700,0:13:08.400
to attribute the glory to themselves

0:13:08.400,0:13:11.680
but when we fail, we look for a scapegoat.

0:13:11.680,0:13:13.720
When we fail, we point fingers.

0:13:13.720,0:13:18.640
We blame - "I'm from a bad family, poor family background,

0:13:18.640,0:13:22.360
this person is the one responsible for this I'm facing..."

0:13:22.360,0:13:29.220
We easily point fingers when we fail but when we do well, we attribute it to ourselves.

0:13:29.220,0:13:31.000
This is pride.

0:13:31.000,0:13:35.440
Pride causes you to view yourself as a victim.

0:13:35.440,0:13:39.680
Whenever you face a situation that is contrary to your expectation,

0:13:39.680,0:13:42.720
you begin to say, "Why are they treating me like this?

0:13:42.720,0:13:44.400
Why is it happening to me like this?

0:13:44.400,0:13:47.300
This guy - we were working together; he was promoted, not me.

0:13:47.300,0:13:51.980
Why me of all this, me, me?" Pride.

0:13:51.980,0:13:56.820
This pride grieves the Holy Spirit.

0:13:56.820,0:14:00.520
As a Christian, we should take our stand. Do you know what the stand of a Christian is?

0:14:00.520,0:14:10.900
As a Christian, we know that victory is not final and defeat is not fatal.

0:14:10.900,0:14:17.200
If we succeed today, we give glory to God because the best is yet to come;

0:14:17.200,0:14:24.660
if we fail today, we submit to God's will because the end has not yet come - that's a Christian.

0:14:24.660,0:14:30.320
It's so common for people today to attribute their success to themselves

0:14:30.320,0:14:37.940
whereas we know that we are who we are, where we are and what we are by God's grace.

0:14:37.940,0:14:40.720
Everything we have today comes from God.

0:14:40.720,0:14:45.740
All we are doing is simply giving back to Him what we have freely received from His generous hands.

0:14:45.740,0:14:48.240
It's all about Jesus.

0:14:48.240,0:14:53.380
But today another example of pride: you see people boasting about their material possessions,

0:14:53.380,0:14:55.600
boasting about the number of cars they have,

0:14:55.600,0:14:58.580
boasting about the amount of money in their bank accounts,

0:14:58.580,0:15:00.700
boasting about A, B, C, D

0:15:00.700,0:15:06.060
when the Bible says, the Spirit is greater than material possessions.

0:15:06.060,0:15:11.600
You see even - I'm sorry to say this - but even in the house of God today, pride is trying to infiltrate.

0:15:11.600,0:15:19.240
You see in some places, they celebrate the name of the pastor more than the name of Jesus,

0:15:19.240,0:15:23.780
building the brand of the ministry more than building the Kingdom of God.

0:15:23.780,0:15:30.860
We as part of this great commission have a wonderful example in the life of Prophet T.B.Joshua.

0:15:30.860,0:15:33.780
Prophet T.B. Joshua said and I quote - I remember this so vividly -

0:15:33.780,0:15:41.760
he said, "The more God uses me, the more I humble myself because the work of healing is not mine,

0:15:41.760,0:15:45.600
the work of deliverance is not mine, the work of prophecy is not mine."

0:15:45.600,0:15:49.480
No man can claim credit for God's work.

0:15:49.480,0:15:58.360
Tell your neighbour, "Don't take the credit".

0:15:58.360,0:16:00.140
That is pride.

0:16:00.140,0:16:03.900
Pride hardens our hearts.

0:16:03.900,0:16:09.520
Pride masks the true condition of our hearts.

0:16:09.520,0:16:15.340
Pride clouds the eyes of our understanding.

0:16:15.340,0:16:18.940
Pride distorts our vision.

0:16:18.940,0:16:23.200
Pride keeps us from dealing with the truth.

0:16:23.200,0:16:26.040
Pride blinds us from reality.

0:16:26.040,0:16:28.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:28.860,0:16:38.300
Because you begin to view yourself as a victim, pride easily leads to offence.

0:16:38.300,0:16:42.900
Someone embarrasses you, someone insults you, you say, "How can they do this to me?

0:16:42.900,0:16:44.760
How can they say this about me?"

0:16:44.760,0:16:52.560
Because of pride, we quickly pick offence and by so doing, we grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:16:52.560,0:16:55.660
I want to give a practical example of this.

0:16:55.660,0:17:02.220
If I can just have one volunteer; any volunteer if the Lord puts it in your heart, just come forward.

0:17:02.220,0:17:06.860
One volunteer. Ok, thank you very much, madam. God bless you.

0:17:06.860,0:17:14.040
Now, this a very simple example but I want you to examine your life in the light of this.

0:17:14.040,0:17:18.120
Madam, we are both Christians, we are brethren, we are colleagues in Christ

0:17:18.120,0:17:23.520
but I want you to do something; I want you to insult me, ok?

0:17:23.520,0:17:27.200
Don't worry, just for this example.

0:17:27.200,0:17:30.840
We are here together; I just want you to insult me and after you insult me, walk off.

0:17:30.840,0:17:31.880
You are stupid.

0:17:31.880,0:17:34.860
What?

0:17:34.860,0:17:36.900
Ok, now stop.

0:17:36.900,0:17:39.240
I hope you  follow the example now.

0:17:39.240,0:17:42.740
She is  a Christian, I'm a Christian. She just called me what?

0:17:42.740,0:17:45.020
She said, "You are stupid," and she walked off.

0:17:45.020,0:17:51.460
Now at this moment, if I have pride, do you know what I'm going to do?

0:17:51.460,0:17:55.400
I'm going to start looking at her - "How can this lady call me stupid?

0:17:55.400,0:17:59.180
What kind of nonsense is this? Does she not know who I am?

0:17:59.180,0:18:03.020
Are we not colleagues? What is the meaning of all this nonsense?"

0:18:03.020,0:18:08.440
As a result of pride, what happens? Offence steps in.

0:18:08.440,0:18:10.200
I hope you are with me.

0:18:10.200,0:18:15.900
Grudges step in, unforgiveness steps in, bitterness steps in

0:18:15.900,0:18:19.700
and your grudge grieves the Holy Spirit.

0:18:19.700,0:18:22.340
Do you know when you need the Holy Spirit?

0:18:22.340,0:18:26.440
When you are insulted, the Holy Spirit is there to comfort you

0:18:26.440,0:18:31.080
but today, we reject the comfort of the Comforter.

0:18:31.080,0:18:37.920
Today, we reject the help of the Helper by our grudge, our offence, our pride.

0:18:37.920,0:18:41.160
And when we reject the help of the Helper, what do we do?

0:18:41.160,0:18:44.740
We start looking for human help to make us feel better.

0:18:44.740,0:18:48.680
You go and meet someone and say, "Sir, do you know what that lady just called me?

0:18:48.680,0:18:51.540
What kind of nonsense is this? This is terrible. This is ridiculous".

0:18:51.540,0:18:54.720
And you are going to have sympathy on me.

0:18:54.720,0:18:56.640
Oh, we are sorry.

0:18:56.640,0:18:59.700
Do you know how many people have said, "We are sorry" to you?

0:18:59.700,0:19:03.800
And their sorry has not changed you.

0:19:03.800,0:19:07.980
We look for human sympathy, we quickly... we can call someone up and say,

0:19:07.980,0:19:12.420
"Ah, do you know that this woman, do you know what she just said to me? This is nonsense.

0:19:12.420,0:19:15.220
And we are friends. Do you know how she called me stupid in public?

0:19:15.220,0:19:16.640
What kind of nonsense is this?"

0:19:16.640,0:19:19.160
And the person will begin to say, "Haa, it's true; it's very bad.

0:19:19.160,0:19:24.180
"How can they say this to you? Sorry, hee hee".

0:19:24.180,0:19:28.340
And the person you are sharing the problem with cannot solve your problem.

0:19:28.340,0:19:32.900
In fact, the person you are sharing the problem with, often has the same problem as you

0:19:32.900,0:19:35.920
and you wonder why your problem does not go.

0:19:35.920,0:19:38.620
What we are doing by this offence -

0:19:38.620,0:19:44.280
we are rejecting the help of the Helper, we are rejecting the counsel of the Counsellor,

0:19:44.280,0:19:46.680
we are rejecting the comfort of the Comforter,

0:19:46.680,0:19:49.760
and we're on our own because we grieve the Holy Spirit,

0:19:49.760,0:19:54.580
the Holy Spirit that is there to comfort us, to provide for us, to guide us, to strengthen us

0:19:54.580,0:19:57.660
in those moments when we're insulted, embarrassed and tempted.

0:19:57.660,0:19:59.620
We grieve Him.

0:19:59.620,0:20:03.120
Tell your neighbour, "Check yourself".

0:20:03.120,0:20:04.960
Are you with me, people of God?

0:20:04.960,0:20:07.500
Now do you know the very painful thing about this?

0:20:07.500,0:20:13.580
Our sister here, whilst I'm busy nursing my grudge, nursing my bitterness, nursing my pain,

0:20:13.580,0:20:19.220
my sister here is also a Christian - do you know as she's left, you don't know what is going on in her heart.

0:20:19.220,0:20:24.480
The same Holy Spirit is convicting her, "That what you said is not right,

0:20:24.480,0:20:26.740
you are not supposed to use that kind of language".

0:20:26.740,0:20:32.560
And do you know that this same lady that night, whilst I'm busy in pain,

0:20:32.560,0:20:36.800
this same lady went on her knees and reconciled with God.

0:20:36.800,0:20:40.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:40.160,0:20:42.820
Now imagine the scenario.

0:20:42.820,0:20:50.400
The person that offended me is free and me that was offended is in bondage.

0:20:50.400,0:20:57.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:57.460,0:21:00.040
Now, let me continue.

0:21:00.040,0:21:03.020
Madam, you are going to come back; I'm still busy nursing my wound.

0:21:03.020,0:21:07.300
You are going to meet me, come back and just say, "I'm sorry," greet me and walk off.

0:21:07.300,0:21:10.460
And I want you to see how many of us react. Ok, come.

0:21:10.460,0:21:14.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:14.420,0:21:16.040
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

0:21:16.040,0:21:20.360
I am very sorry about what I said to you the other day and I apologise.

0:21:20.360,0:21:23.020
It comes sincere from my heart.

0:21:23.020,0:21:24.700
- Ok.
- I'm very sorry about that.

0:21:24.700,0:21:25.540
No problem.

0:21:25.540,0:21:28.200
Now, she is going to turn away. I want you to look at me.

0:21:28.200,0:21:28.900
Ok, go ahead.

0:21:28.900,0:21:31.880
- Please forgive me.
- I have forgiven you; no problem, go ahead.

0:21:31.880,0:21:36.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:36.120,0:21:37.780
I hope you are following me.

0:21:37.780,0:21:41.560
You say, "I have forgiven you, go ahead". In your heart - "You stupid woman!

0:21:41.560,0:21:45.500
Do you call this an apology? What kind of nonsense is this?"

0:21:45.500,0:21:49.900
And she is free. She is continuing her journey. Nothing is disturbing her heart.

0:21:49.900,0:21:54.060
She is the one that insulted you, but she is free because she didn't grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:21:54.060,0:21:57.840
When the Holy Spirit prompted her conscience to repent, she repented.

0:21:57.840,0:22:06.120
But you that was insulted, you are in a chamber of bondage.

0:22:06.120,0:22:11.280
You've rejected the help of the Helper when you needed His help the most.

0:22:11.280,0:22:14.720
You rejected the comfort of the Comforter when you needed His comfort.

0:22:14.720,0:22:19.400
That is why we start going to look for comfort in the world, to look for comfort from friends,

0:22:19.400,0:22:25.980
to look for help from people with good intentions who can provide human sympathy, human pity

0:22:25.980,0:22:31.920
but no amount of human sympathy has changed you; no amount of human pity has changed you.

0:22:31.920,0:22:37.060
Only the Holy Spirit can change you and we grieve Him.

0:22:37.060,0:22:40.560
Thank you very much. Let's clap for our mother here.

0:22:40.560,0:22:42.500
A wonderful insult.

0:22:42.500,0:22:47.680
Just grab an altar fruit by the grace of God and you can go back to your seat.

0:22:47.680,0:22:52.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:52.600,0:22:59.620
Wow! Just because of "you're stupid", see what she is enjoying. Thank You, Jesus.

0:22:59.620,0:23:05.140
In this world, there will be disturbance.

0:23:05.140,0:23:10.780
If you want to be in a place where nothing will disturb you, you will reach Heaven.

0:23:10.780,0:23:15.740
In this world, people will insult you, embarrass you, falsely accuse you.

0:23:15.740,0:23:18.200
You will face... look, I just used the example of insult.

0:23:18.200,0:23:21.800
You can use your own scenario and insert it into this example.

0:23:21.800,0:23:25.080
Perhaps you are facing barreness, perhaps there are marital challenges,

0:23:25.080,0:23:27.200
perhaps there is lack of promotion at your work place,

0:23:27.200,0:23:29.320
perhaps people hate you for no just cause.

0:23:29.320,0:23:32.640
We all have a situation.

0:23:32.640,0:23:38.220
Something pokes us, something prods us, something hits us - that's this life!

0:23:38.220,0:23:40.960
In fact, that's the beauty of our journey into eternity.

0:23:40.960,0:23:44.860
It is these things that help us to realise how much we need God.

0:23:44.860,0:23:51.260
Today, when we are tempted, when we are tested, when we are troubled,

0:23:51.260,0:23:57.560
the Holy Spirit that Jesus sent to comfort us is the same Helper that we reject

0:23:57.560,0:24:04.340
because we grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride, by holding a grudge against someone.

0:24:04.340,0:24:08.840
The Holy Spirit is there to comfort you with the Words of God; He is there.

0:24:08.840,0:24:12.180
And I remember Prophet T.B.Joshua saying something that touched me so much.

0:24:12.180,0:24:14.440
He said this and I quote:

0:24:14.440,0:24:21.080
"There is nothing I cannot overlook for the sake of Jesus."

0:24:21.080,0:24:23.660
I want to ask you to examine yourself.

0:24:23.660,0:24:27.340
What are you facing in this life that Jesus Himself did not face?

0:24:27.340,0:24:30.340
Jesus said, a servant cannot be greater than a master,

0:24:30.340,0:24:32.860
if the world hated me, they will hate you also.

0:24:32.860,0:24:35.700
Are you being hated? Are you being falsely accused?

0:24:35.700,0:24:38.400
Jesus Christ was called the king of demons.

0:24:38.400,0:24:43.540
Have you been betrayed? Jesus Christ was betrayed by His disciple.

0:24:43.540,0:24:45.280
Have you been persecuted?

0:24:45.280,0:24:52.960
Jesus Christ was nailed to the Cross of Calvary and He said, "Father, forgive them".

0:24:52.960,0:24:55.500
But, today, just a little poke, you hold offence.

0:24:55.500,0:24:57.600
Just a little prod, you say, "Why me?"

0:24:57.600,0:25:01.060
Just a little hit, you say, "Why is God allowing this to happen to me?"

0:25:01.060,0:25:07.440
By so doing, we grieve the Holy Spirit

0:25:07.440,0:25:09.580
I ask the question again:

0:25:09.580,0:25:14.460
Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?

0:25:14.460,0:25:18.780
The Holy Spirit cannot share a heart that is full of offence.

0:25:18.780,0:25:25.340
He cannot share a heart that is full of unforgiveness, pain of the past, bitterness, grief.

0:25:25.340,0:25:27.320
He will not force Himself on you.

0:25:27.320,0:25:30.140
If He sees the place that He is supposed to be is not conducive,

0:25:30.140,0:25:33.020
He will leave and you are on your own.

0:25:33.020,0:25:35.840
That's number 2: the way we grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:25:35.840,0:25:43.140
Number 3: We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.

0:25:43.140,0:25:48.380
Let me just give a capital example of how we ignore the Holy Spirit.

0:25:48.380,0:26:02.260
Today, it is common for people to pick their Bible and quickly start reading it

0:26:02.260,0:26:07.420
without seeking the attention of the Holy Spirit

0:26:07.420,0:26:12.520
when this Bible we are seeing was inspired by the Holy Spirit.

0:26:12.520,0:26:18.040
For you to read the Bible effectively, you must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.

0:26:18.040,0:26:21.760
Jesus said His Word is Spirit and life.

0:26:21.760,0:26:29.300
Reading the Bible without the Holy Spirit is just reading literature, history, reading about events

0:26:29.300,0:26:31.760
This is why the Bible makes no meaning to us.

0:26:31.760,0:26:39.040
We can quote Scripture but our lives don't seem to quote the evidence of Scripture.

0:26:39.040,0:26:44.580
We grieve Him when we take our Bible and read without involving the Holy Spirit,

0:26:44.580,0:26:47.300
without asking for His help, seeking His attention.

0:26:47.300,0:26:50.360
"Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of You."

0:26:50.360,0:26:56.300
You can't read this Bible unless the Holy Spirit helps you to understand.

0:26:56.300,0:27:00.340
We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.

0:27:00.340,0:27:01.740
Number 4:

0:27:01.740,0:27:10.440
We grieve the Holy Spirit when we force Him to see and hear what is opposed to His will.

0:27:10.440,0:27:20.920
This is affecting almost every one of us today, especially the younger generation.

0:27:20.920,0:27:30.000
Today, we are so often exposed to things that are contrary to God.

0:27:30.000,0:27:37.180
We watch lustful things, dirty things, abominable things

0:27:37.180,0:27:43.640
and the Bible says that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit.

0:27:43.640,0:27:46.480
1 Corinthians 6:19-20.

0:27:46.480,0:27:53.720
Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and you want the Holy Spirit to dwell, to live in you.

0:27:53.720,0:28:02.000
You sit down and watch things on television, on the internet, read things in books, listen to music

0:28:02.000,0:28:04.720
that is contrary to the Holy Spirit.

0:28:04.720,0:28:10.140
You grieve Him; you want to force Him to see what is opposed to His will,

0:28:10.140,0:28:18.200
watching things that promote lust, fornication, hatred, violence.

0:28:18.200,0:28:22.860
You may say, "It's not affecting me, I'm just watching it to pass my time".

0:28:22.860,0:28:28.740
A Christian must be careful of what he sees because what he sees influences his thoughts.

0:28:28.740,0:28:32.820
I'm sure you can relate with this; many times you have watched something just once

0:28:32.820,0:28:37.080
but you can replay what you have watched a thousand times in your mind.

0:28:37.080,0:28:40.380
I remember when I was a young boy, around nine or ten years old,

0:28:40.380,0:28:45.840
I accidentally walked into a room where they were playing a horror film - disgusting.

0:28:45.840,0:28:50.520
I just saw that clip for 2 minutes, and I left.

0:28:50.520,0:28:54.060
I had nightmares for 2 months.

0:28:54.060,0:28:58.800
When I closed my eyes, I was re-watching what I saw in those 2 minutes.

0:28:58.800,0:29:01.120
I just saw it once, I didn't mean to go there.

0:29:01.120,0:29:04.100
I just came in, adults in the room were watching this.

0:29:04.100,0:29:05.880
I am not supposed to be there as a young boy.

0:29:05.880,0:29:11.760
I saw it, I quickly left but what I saw affected my heart.

0:29:11.760,0:29:19.380
You can just watch pornography and replay what you have watched a 100 times in your head

0:29:19.380,0:29:22.140
and you are grieving the Holy Spirit.

0:29:22.140,0:29:24.200
Think about our young generation today.

Parents here - examine what your children are exposed to.

0:29:28.040,0:29:32.480
Today, it's so easy with the accessibility of technology and the internet

0:29:32.480,0:29:36.380
You find people at a young age exposed to things that are immoral,

0:29:36.380,0:29:41.440
exposed to things that are corrupt, exposed to things that are dirty,

0:29:41.440,0:29:44.860
and we want the Holy Spirit to live in us.

0:29:44.860,0:29:49.940
The Holy Spirit cannot dwell in a dirty place.

0:29:49.940,0:29:52.820
Our children are playing video games where they are shooting each other

0:29:52.820,0:29:55.260
and you wonder why they have violent tendencies.

0:29:55.260,0:30:00.060
Our children are watching films and movies and soap operas where they celebrate lust

0:30:00.060,0:30:03.060
and they think it's normal for there to be sexual immorality

0:30:03.060,0:30:04.600
and you wonder why at a young age,

0:30:04.600,0:30:09.280
you see young people begin to go into all kinds of stupid and nonsensical things

0:30:09.280,0:30:18.180
because they are watching things, reading things, listening to music

0:30:18.180,0:30:23.440
that's contrary to God and we grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:30:23.440,0:30:26.300
1 John 2:16.

0:30:26.300,0:30:28.600
Are you with me, people of God?

0:30:28.600,0:30:33.080
That's why when I ask that question, "Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?",

0:30:33.080,0:30:35.320
the question is pregnant.

0:30:35.320,0:30:38.980
You need to examine yourself in the light of God's Word.

0:30:38.980,0:30:44.260
Perhaps 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the areas I have spoken of today may relate with you.

0:30:44.260,0:30:53.180
The truth is, as you're here in church today, coming to receive something from God,

0:30:53.180,0:31:01.320
you cannot make spiritual progress on the platform of pretence.

0:31:01.320,0:31:06.800
You are here, you want to impress God, impress the Holy Spirit into releasing what you here for,

0:31:06.800,0:31:13.060
but in your private life, behind closed doors, when you are back home, you are still grieving the Holy Spirit.

0:31:13.060,0:31:18.120
You cannot deceive God.

0:31:18.120,0:31:21.040
God knows you better than you know yourself.

0:31:21.040,0:31:25.760
Do you know how you can know when you grieve the Holy Spirit?

0:31:25.760,0:31:33.920
You can now when there is absence of peace; everyone here can identify with this.

0:31:33.920,0:31:39.060
You know when you take an action that steals your peace.

0:31:39.060,0:31:41.800
You can run away from God with riches and wealth

0:31:41.800,0:31:46.780
but you cannot run away with peace of heart.

0:31:46.780,0:31:49.160
Peace!

0:31:49.160,0:31:53.620
Why can't we strive and struggle for peace?

0:31:53.620,0:32:01.200
When there is peace of heart, there is no need for division, fighting, conflict, envy and jealousy.

0:32:01.200,0:32:05.780
What is the cause of all of the challenges so many of us are facing today?

0:32:05.780,0:32:09.660
We are not content. You have A, you want B, you have B, you want C,

0:32:09.660,0:32:11.920
you have C, you want D, you have D, you want E.

0:32:11.920,0:32:16.500
When will you stop wanting? We are not content.

0:32:16.500,0:32:20.560
Little things, we compare ourselves with others; little things, we judge ourselves by others.

0:32:20.560,0:32:22.800
Little things, we measure ourselves by ourselves

0:32:22.800,0:32:26.340
because we are not content; we don't have peace.

0:32:26.340,0:32:32.220
And the Holy Spirit is the Giver of peace.

0:32:32.220,0:32:37.740
We reject the peace of the Peace-Giver when we harbour offence in our heart.

0:32:37.740,0:32:42.240
We reject the joy of the Joy-Giver when we are prideful.

0:32:42.240,0:32:47.980
We reject the guidance of the Roadmap when we ignore Him.

0:32:47.980,0:32:55.040
We reject the strength of our Strengthener when we watch things intentionally

0:32:55.040,0:32:58.340
that are contrary to His will.

0:32:58.340,0:33:01.820
So brethren, in conclusion:

0:33:01.820,0:33:05.560
Don't grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:33:10.900,0:33:14.320
Don't grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:33:14.320,0:33:17.600
The Holy Spirit wants to be the Lord of your life.

0:33:17.600,0:33:21.020
He wants to possess you entirely

0:33:21.020,0:33:25.680
so that you are no longer in control of this little vessel in which you sail.

0:33:25.680,0:33:29.500
You are a passenger, you can be a crew member but you are not in charge.

0:33:29.500,0:33:32.240
You are not in control.

0:33:32.240,0:33:37.020
Put the Holy Spirit in charge; put the Holy Spirit in control.

0:33:37.020,0:33:43.640
When you welcome the Holy Spirit into your heart, you begin to think differently, dream differently,

0:33:43.640,0:33:46.260
you begin to have a sensitivity you never had before.

0:33:46.260,0:33:54.040
You will have the privilege of letting the Creator of Heaven and earth assist you in all you do.

0:33:54.040,0:34:02.700
And I pray that this Word finds a place in your heart today, in Jesus' name.

0:34:02.700,0:34:06.580
May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts.
