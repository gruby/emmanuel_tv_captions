0:00:00.000,0:00:04.340
As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,

0:00:04.340,0:00:08.100
all the works of satan in the lives of the people are destroyed,

0:00:08.100,0:00:12.640
bringing them out of the kingdom of darkness and into the kingdom of light.

0:00:12.640,0:00:14.760
As the man of God prays for this woman,

0:00:14.760,0:00:19.240
she falls to the ground as the evil spirit inside her begins to manifest.

0:00:19.240,0:00:22.540
Let us hear what it has to say.

0:00:22.540,0:00:25.440
I am a snake from the father's side.

0:00:25.440,0:00:27.080
Yes.

0:00:27.080,0:00:31.100
No peace. She thinks she wants to be married. For what?

0:00:31.100,0:00:36.080
There's no peace. The husband has another woman - for two years.

0:00:36.080,0:00:37.760
They have four children.

0:00:37.760,0:00:41.660
Eighteen years of marriage and he doesn't want to talk to her.

0:00:41.660,0:00:44.440
She took his money and ran away and came here - for what?

0:00:44.440,0:00:48.240
You people cannot deliver her. For what? Nothing!

0:00:48.240,0:00:52.420
She opened a business - she can't sell. The husband will close it.

0:00:52.420,0:00:57.780
Yes, everybody on the father's side - no marriage.

0:00:57.780,0:01:00.300
She is the one that said she wants to marry.

0:01:00.300,0:01:02.300
She is married for what?

0:01:02.300,0:01:05.140
As you can see, the woman is not herself.

0:01:05.140,0:01:08.100
She falls to the ground as the evil spirit - the snake -

0:01:08.100,0:01:10.660
that destroyed her marriage manifests.

0:01:10.660,0:01:16.900
No peace in her marriage. She hates the husband. They are fighting; every day, they are fighting.

0:01:16.900,0:01:20.500
From the father's side.

0:01:20.500,0:01:25.460
After the confession, T.B. Joshua delivers her in Jesus' name.

0:01:25.460,0:01:29.020
Thank You, Jesus, for setting me free!

0:01:29.020,0:01:33.460
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:33.460,0:01:36.460
My name is Angel Nwokoye.

0:01:36.460,0:01:40.800
I am originally from Mozambique but I live in South Africa.

0:01:40.800,0:01:48.160
I want to thank God that I came to The SCOAN, and I was located on the prayer line on Monday.

0:01:48.160,0:01:55.380
I was delivered from the spirit of snake that had been tormenting my marriage.

0:01:55.380,0:01:58.340
That spirit used to tell me to leave my marriage.

0:01:58.340,0:02:01.720
But I discovered that my husband, after our first child -

0:02:01.720,0:02:05.220
I didn't know that he had another child with another woman outside.

0:02:05.220,0:02:12.480
Three weeks after, he then told me that there was another woman who had a child for him,

0:02:12.480,0:02:15.040
that she came to his shop without the child.

0:02:15.040,0:02:20.360
After that, he was drinking, smoking, womanising and gambling.

0:02:20.360,0:02:24.620
Whenever I tried to talk to him, there was no peace; we would fight at home

0:02:24.620,0:02:27.100
and the children were scattered.

0:02:27.100,0:02:30.040
Because of that, I tried to report him to my dad.

0:02:30.040,0:02:34.220
My dad said he cannot do anything because I said I wanted to marry a Nigerian,

0:02:34.220,0:02:37.380
so I should go ahead and take care of myself.

0:02:37.380,0:02:40.460
Both my mother's family and my father's family abandoned me.

0:02:40.460,0:02:42.080
There was no one to help.

0:02:42.080,0:02:46.140
So now, I thought that I have four children with him.

0:02:46.140,0:02:50.200
For two years, he has been living with another lady; he only comes home to change.

0:02:50.200,0:02:54.980
He has rented a house for the woman in South Africa, taking care of the lady.

0:02:54.980,0:02:58.060
I even tried to confront the lady. The lady said she is not going to leave him

0:02:58.060,0:03:01.720
because he is the one who put her into that relationship

0:03:01.720,0:03:05.120
so if he wants, he must leave her but she is not leaving.

0:03:05.120,0:03:09.340
So now, when he decided that he was leaving, to come to Anambra (Nigeria),

0:03:09.340,0:03:10.840
because he is a Nigerian --

0:03:10.840,0:03:15.240
When he left, there was a friend of his that was supposed to bring money for him.

0:03:15.240,0:03:19.160
What I decided to do after he had left - I took that money,

0:03:19.160,0:03:21.820
I bought a ticket to come to The SCOAN.

0:03:21.820,0:03:30.240
When I arrived here on Sunday, I thank God that he located me through the prayer line,

0:03:30.240,0:03:34.220
and the man of God took care of me; he even gave me 15,000 naira

0:03:34.220,0:03:37.960
for my upkeep, food and everything.

0:03:37.960,0:03:44.060
So after that, I was delivered and set free.

0:03:44.060,0:03:47.660
When I was set free and went to the lodge to sleep,

0:03:47.660,0:03:51.840
the snake came to me, asking me what it was that I was doing.

0:03:51.840,0:03:57.200
That I now came to The SCOAN to seek for help to be delivered - for what?

0:03:57.200,0:04:00.760
When I tried to wake up to see who was talking, the snake vanished.

0:04:00.760,0:04:02.960
It vanished; I couldn't see it again.

0:04:02.960,0:04:06.960
That is how I realised that I was free and set free indeed.

0:04:06.960,0:04:09.540
Man of God, I thank you for what you have done for me.

0:04:09.540,0:04:16.220
I am here to seek God's intervention upon my marriage.

0:04:16.220,0:04:18.820
I have four kids with him.

0:04:18.820,0:04:21.980
Please, Man of God, help me; I have nowhere to go!

0:04:21.980,0:04:29.540
I want my husband back but it is not in my hands; I don't want to go to the street with my kids.

0:04:29.540,0:04:31.420
We have just heard a wonderful testimony.

0:04:31.420,0:04:34.140
In other words, ever since you have been delivered,

0:04:34.140,0:04:36.280
you no longer see that snake?

0:04:36.280,0:04:38.600
No more - I'm free!

0:04:38.600,0:04:42.340
To God be the glory! And you are also here to know God's opinion about your marriage.

0:04:42.340,0:04:43.280
Yes.

0:04:43.280,0:04:45.700
To God be the glory! What about your husband?

0:04:45.700,0:04:50.100
I don't know where he is right now.

0:04:50.100,0:04:53.320
Ok, to God be the glory. This was a case that happened last week.

0:04:53.320,0:04:57.020
After she was delivered, the man of God took it upon himself

0:04:57.020,0:04:59.440
to ask the evangelists to invite her husband.

0:04:59.440,0:05:06.980
And to the glory of God, we believe her husband is in the midst of the people here right now.

0:05:06.980,0:05:09.640
So we want to invite him forward.

0:05:09.640,0:05:15.120
Testimony Time

0:05:15.120,0:05:18.180
My name is Ndubuisi Chika Nowokoye.

0:05:18.180,0:05:26.400
I am from Oka in Anambra State (Nigeria), residing in South Africa.

0:05:26.400,0:05:30.980
This is my junior sister - the last one from my mother's womb.

0:05:30.980,0:05:33.480
This woman is my wife.

0:05:33.480,0:05:38.120
It is true that she has four kids with me.

0:05:38.120,0:05:43.700
I met her seventeen years ago in South Africa.

0:05:43.700,0:05:47.520
She is resident in South Africa but originally from Mozambique.

0:05:47.520,0:05:53.800
So, when I met her, I approached her like a man approaches a lady.

0:05:53.800,0:05:58.920
From there, we entered into a relationship.

0:05:58.920,0:06:08.040
But before then, I had broken out from a relationship with a lady who has a kid for me.

0:06:08.040,0:06:13.360
When I met her, I approached her; we continued going from there.

0:06:13.360,0:06:16.380
She has a family in South Africa.

0:06:16.380,0:06:20.580
Her grandfather is living in South Africa; her grandmother is living in South Africa with their children.

0:06:20.580,0:06:22.660
So we went and met them.

0:06:22.660,0:06:26.420
After that approach to marry her, to which she agreed,

0:06:26.420,0:06:33.240
I went to Mozambique to pay marriage rights and everything.

0:06:33.240,0:06:40.220
First year to the fourth year, the marriage was so sweet.

0:06:40.220,0:06:48.420
Then, I don't know what happened, she wanted to 'ride' me; she wanted to be the man of the house.

0:06:48.420,0:06:51.540
She wanted to order me to do what she wanted.

0:06:51.540,0:06:53.240
I said, no, I am from Oka.

0:06:53.240,0:06:57.140
As far as I am concerned, no woman can put us under this thing.

0:06:57.140,0:07:01.920
It is true that I am in South Africa but I know where I come from.

0:07:01.920,0:07:08.520
No woman I know can put me in a cage, that whatever she says, is what I will do now.

0:07:08.520,0:07:14.580
She wants to know about my money, who I do business with, where I keep the money.

0:07:14.580,0:07:17.660
So, many times she would be threatening me that she will take the children and go;

0:07:17.660,0:07:19.060
that I will not see the children.

0:07:19.060,0:07:21.800
She has done it more than five times.

0:07:21.800,0:07:24.940
At a time, it was unbearable.

0:07:24.940,0:07:30.100
So, I complained to my sisters and family at home.

0:07:30.100,0:07:32.660
They were telling me that I know where I come from;

0:07:32.660,0:07:35.740
don't let a woman kill you in South Africa.

0:07:35.740,0:07:38.660
If worse comes to worse, let her go.

0:07:38.660,0:07:45.720
But I tried to patch up.

0:07:45.720,0:07:49.700
It came to a stage where I felt no more happiness in me.

0:07:49.700,0:07:52.780
It made me to drink a lot and go out.

0:07:52.780,0:07:57.600
Whenever I decided to go back home, my heart would tremble.

0:07:57.600,0:08:02.740
I would say, no, let me leave her at home and have my pleasure in the bar.

0:08:02.740,0:08:09.580
Six months ago, I had a fatal accident when I was about to go home.

0:08:09.580,0:08:12.240
I was drunk, driving home.

0:08:12.240,0:08:15.260
My car tumbled eight times; I nearly died.

0:08:15.260,0:08:20.020
I came out alive, nothing happened to me, but the car is beyond repair - crushed -

0:08:20.020,0:08:22.140
because of this woman.

0:08:22.140,0:08:26.640
So at the end of the day, I said to myself, no, for me to die,

0:08:26.640,0:08:30.680
I don't want to die for this woman; let me let her go.

0:08:30.680,0:08:34.980
I told her that I am travelling to Nigeria to visit my parents but she didn't know my plan.

0:08:34.980,0:08:37.720
My plan was that I am fed up.

0:08:37.720,0:08:39.900
I don't need her again.

0:08:39.900,0:08:51.420
I'm tired of the miserable life we have been living for 12 years now.

0:08:51.420,0:08:57.720
So, I came to Nigeria to look for a wife but I did not tell my parents.

0:08:57.720,0:09:00.360
I did not tell my father and sisters.

0:09:00.360,0:09:02.740
Whenever they are asking of her, I would be saying, she is fine.

0:09:02.740,0:09:06.480
When I call her phone, her phone is on voicemail.

0:09:06.480,0:09:10.000
Then, I don't know what happened, the whole Saturday I was stressed.

0:09:10.000,0:09:11.220
I asked myself, what happened now.

0:09:11.220,0:09:14.080
Maybe she has run away again because she ran away with the children many times.

0:09:14.080,0:09:17.020
Many times she ran away with my money and misuse it.

0:09:17.020,0:09:22.500
The next day being Sunday, I had a call from friends that they saw my wife in The SCOAN.

0:09:22.500,0:09:24.160
I said, what?

0:09:24.160,0:09:30.580
So does this mean that this woman left a kid of six months with other children for Nigeria?

0:09:30.580,0:09:35.840
But if she is in The SCOAN, I don't know, but I want to hear what the man of God will say.

0:09:35.840,0:09:38.540
They said that they saw her; she manifested.

0:09:38.540,0:09:40.540
I used to watch Emmanuel TV.

0:09:40.540,0:09:42.700
I know what the man of God can do.

0:09:42.700,0:09:46.200
But now I have decided that I don't want this woman; I don't need her again.

0:09:46.200,0:09:50.940
On Monday, I had a call from The SCOAN. They said that the man of God wants to see me.

0:09:50.940,0:09:53.580
Hey! That's a call I can't refuse!

0:09:53.580,0:09:58.200
If it were her mother, father or brother, I wouldn't come.

0:09:58.200,0:10:03.500
But because of this call - it is a call I cannot say no to.

0:10:03.500,0:10:06.340
I called my sister that there is a call from The SCOAN,

0:10:06.340,0:10:08.840
and that there is nothing I can do; I have to come.

0:10:08.840,0:10:16.160
But what I want to tell the man of God - please, I know you get it directly from Heaven,

0:10:16.160,0:10:19.840
what is God saying here, but for me, it's okay.

0:10:19.840,0:10:21.120
I'm full.

0:10:21.120,0:10:29.760
So, I want the man of God to help me, to tell me so that I can continue looking for what I'm looking for.

0:10:29.760,0:10:31.440
We thank God for this occasion.

0:10:31.440,0:10:37.200
Could you, sir, tell us how many children the woman has for you.

0:10:37.200,0:10:38.980
Four.

0:10:38.980,0:10:43.500
To God be the glory. And you are here to hear God's opinion from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:10:43.500,0:10:46.440
Yes, because I know that the man of God hears directly from Heaven.

0:10:46.440,0:10:49.700
Whatever he says to me now is what God says.

0:10:49.700,0:10:55.280
And that is the final conclusion.

0:10:55.280,0:10:56.580
To God be the glory.

0:10:56.580,0:11:02.280
As we all know, the man of God, where he is, we believe he is listening to this situation,

0:11:02.280,0:11:06.080
and by the special grace of God, he will be coming out in the power of the Holy Ghost

0:11:06.080,0:11:08.080
to address this situation.

0:11:08.080,0:11:10.420
Let's wait patiently for the man of God's arrival.

0:11:10.420,0:11:16.940
Let's hear briefly from your younger sister.

0:11:16.940,0:11:20.140
People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:11:20.140,0:11:23.240
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:11:23.240,0:11:27.000
My name is Chinyere Nwokoye.

0:11:27.000,0:11:29.660
I'm from Oka (Nigeria).

0:11:29.660,0:11:33.900
The man standing beside me is my elder brother.

0:11:33.900,0:11:39.120
The lady next to him is his wife Angel.

0:11:39.120,0:11:44.140
I've been hearing so many complaints from them.

0:11:44.140,0:11:47.920
Almost every week, they called me from South Africa.

0:11:47.920,0:11:50.680
If they don't call me, they call my elder sister,

0:11:50.680,0:11:53.780
complaining about one thing or the other.

0:11:53.780,0:12:01.280
But what I'm going to say is that I believe what is happening in their home is not ordinary.

0:12:01.280,0:12:06.240
So I plead with the man of God to also deliver my brother

0:12:06.240,0:12:13.520
as he has delivered the wife.

0:12:13.520,0:12:17.860
So I'm pleading with the man of God to deliver my brother too

0:12:17.860,0:12:20.500
so that peace will reign in their home.

0:12:20.500,0:12:23.780
As we have heard it earlier on, the man of God is in the best position

0:12:23.780,0:12:26.940
to tell the whole world God's position in this marriage,

0:12:26.940,0:12:31.400
and God bless you as you wait patiently to hear from the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:31.400,0:12:33.220
Thank you very much.

0:12:33.220,0:12:37.300
I was listening to my brother, and the sister has said it all.

0:12:37.300,0:12:43.160
Mr Nwokoye & Family - Nigerian Living In South Africa

0:12:43.160,0:12:49.420
The reason why my sister here was misbehaving in the house

0:12:49.420,0:12:55.680
was as a result of this evil spirit and she has been delivered.

0:12:55.680,0:13:00.180
Now you will have the good of her.

0:13:00.180,0:13:03.500
Now you are having a wife.

0:13:03.500,0:13:09.520
Now you too need to be delivered.

0:13:09.520,0:13:12.780
What marriage now after four children?

0:13:12.780,0:13:17.900
It is true you people have married but it is time now to rededicate your marriage.

0:13:17.900,0:13:20.000
She is free now from the past.

0:13:20.000,0:13:22.560
You too need to be free now from the past.

0:13:22.560,0:13:27.720
You know I said challenges - she has a lot of challenges, and God has delivered her.

0:13:27.720,0:13:34.520
You too have a lot of challenges, even to the extent that you went outside the marriage to have a child.

0:13:34.520,0:13:37.240
And I'm very happy for the honour you give to God.

0:13:37.240,0:13:42.040
And I want to tell you that I'm part of your family.

0:13:42.040,0:13:45.800
My sister, thank you very much for your intervention.

0:13:45.800,0:13:53.380
I want to tell the whole world that this marriage is from God.

0:13:53.380,0:13:58.140
After your deliverance, I want to invite you people again back from South Africa.

0:13:58.140,0:14:01.740
This is your home, and your home is also my home.

0:14:01.740,0:14:06.740
So, I want to tell you that I'm one of your brothers; thank you very much.

0:14:06.740,0:14:11.620
She's a wonderful wife; it is just satan, and satan has been removed.

0:14:11.620,0:14:14.360
On your own side too, satan needs to be removed

0:14:14.360,0:14:16.540
so you people can live in one accord.

0:14:16.540,0:14:20.360
DELIVERANCE TIME

0:14:20.360,0:14:22.720
Following the words of the man of God,

0:14:22.720,0:14:28.120
that the deliverance of the husband will cement the marriage that is from Heaven,

0:14:28.120,0:14:33.920
removing the satanic influence and allowing them to live in one accord.

0:14:33.920,0:14:37.520
The husband was delivered in the power of the Holy Spirit

0:14:37.520,0:14:42.300
when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him in Jesus' name.

0:14:42.300,0:14:44.940
The wife also receives a final touch.

0:14:44.940,0:14:48.660
The right knowledge of God settles peace.

0:14:48.660,0:14:56.840
And rising to their feet after the deliverance, they thank God and embrace in Jesus' name.

0:14:56.840,0:15:00.120
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:15:00.120,0:15:02.260
People of God, good morning!

0:15:02.260,0:15:05.280
My name is Angel Nwokoye.

0:15:05.280,0:15:09.560
I am originally from Mozambique but I live in South Africa.

0:15:09.560,0:15:13.540
The wonderful man beside me is my lovely husband.

0:15:13.540,0:15:18.620
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:15:18.620,0:15:25.260
I'm here to thank God for my deliverance two weeks ago

0:15:25.260,0:15:30.140
when I came to The SCOAN.

0:15:30.140,0:15:34.320
I came here and had an encounter with the man of God,

0:15:34.320,0:15:37.940
and I was delivered from the spirit of snake.

0:15:37.940,0:15:46.260
That spirit had really been tormenting me.

0:15:46.260,0:15:51.200
It was real because when I was growing up as a child,

0:15:51.200,0:15:53.500
I went to my father's village

0:15:53.500,0:15:57.420
and that is where my grandmother was telling me the story

0:15:57.420,0:15:59.940
that there is a house where that snake lives.

0:15:59.940,0:16:03.000
That my great-grandfather was a native doctor,

0:16:03.000,0:16:06.960
my grandfather was a native doctor, and my dad was the one

0:16:06.960,0:16:10.180
that was supposed to take over but he did not.

0:16:10.180,0:16:16.920
So the snake was moving around now, causing my sisters and everybody not to get married,

0:16:16.920,0:16:22.120
which was, I think, during that time that the snake entered me but I did not know.

0:16:22.120,0:16:27.200
So during that time my husband and I would be fighting; there was no peace.

0:16:27.200,0:16:31.700
I discovered that I normally used to see that snake on my pillow;

0:16:31.700,0:16:34.660
sometimes I used to see it between my husband and I.

0:16:34.660,0:16:37.900
I used to tell him that I used to dream of this big snake

0:16:37.900,0:16:39.900
that is coming in between us.

0:16:39.900,0:16:42.200
He would say, no problem, this thing will go.

0:16:42.200,0:16:46.200
But at the end of the day, I started noticing that this thing now -

0:16:46.200,0:16:51.240
I fighting with my husband and thinking that I could correct him - I'm not God.

0:16:51.240,0:16:54.420
Then it must have been this snake that is making him to hate me,

0:16:54.420,0:16:56.940
and making me to leave the house and misbehave.

0:16:56.940,0:17:00.960
So, during that time, I was watching Emmanuel TV,

0:17:00.960,0:17:04.500
the man of God was telling us that in relationship and marriage,

0:17:04.500,0:17:07.960
you should stay true to God; don't budge, let God release you.

0:17:07.960,0:17:13.260
And I would be saying, how will God release me because I was already in pain;

0:17:13.260,0:17:16.340
I was undergoing depression. I didn't know who to talk to.

0:17:16.340,0:17:21.100
When I called my dad, he would tell me I should take the kids, come home and leave this man.

0:17:21.100,0:17:23.880
I would be saying, I know this is not the right thing to do

0:17:23.880,0:17:27.540
because where can I go with four kids; they are all his,

0:17:27.540,0:17:31.700
and there is nowhere I could go to, so why should my dad be saying this.

0:17:31.700,0:17:38.360
To the point when I now talked to my friends, nobody came up with a good advice.

0:17:38.360,0:17:41.080
At the end of the day, this thing was known everywhere

0:17:41.080,0:17:44.780
that my husband and I were fighting because a particular girl that was fighting with me

0:17:44.780,0:17:47.060
from the same church that we were going to.

0:17:47.060,0:17:48.720
So now I said, what will I do.

0:17:48.720,0:17:51.180
I started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:17:51.180,0:17:56.960
I said, God, use these children and remember me for eighteen years of marriage.

0:17:56.960,0:18:00.360
Even if I have offended You, forgive me by using these children.

0:18:00.360,0:18:05.120
I would take this journey and go to The SCOAN so that I will receive my deliverance.

0:18:05.120,0:18:11.620
That was how my husband said he was coming here in December for holidays, and he left the house.

0:18:11.620,0:18:15.580
So now when he left, he sent somebody to bring money to us.

0:18:15.580,0:18:20.420
I told my son, what will I do with this money because I want to travel to The SCOAN.

0:18:20.420,0:18:24.480
My son said, Mummy, even if we don't eat, take this money and go.

0:18:24.480,0:18:27.340
Man of God will see you; just believe.

0:18:27.340,0:18:32.020
That's what I did. I purchased the ticket without him even knowing that I was coming here.

0:18:32.020,0:18:35.460
And I came. When I came here on Sunday,

0:18:35.460,0:18:39.300
glory be to God that the man of God located me

0:18:39.300,0:18:42.840
and he delivered me from that spirit of snake.

0:18:42.840,0:18:46.920
After delivering me, because he is a man of God and hears from Heaven,

0:18:46.920,0:18:52.080
he even knew in his spirit that I didn't even have any money, I had nowhere to go to.

0:18:52.080,0:18:55.300
He offered me a place to stay, he offered me food,

0:18:55.300,0:19:02.080
he took care of me, and I was accommodated. To God be the glory!

0:19:02.080,0:19:10.200
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:19:10.200,0:19:18.860
And then my husband was invited to come over to The SCOAN last week Sunday.

0:19:18.860,0:19:27.040
He too was here because he was called to come for reconciliation.

0:19:27.040,0:19:31.140
So now, I'm here, Man of God, to thank you.

0:19:31.140,0:19:37.340
Thank you very much, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, for the help and the love you gave to me.

0:19:37.340,0:19:42.240
I have never been to any church where I was offered accommodation and food for free.

0:19:42.240,0:19:46.740
All that you hear is "give"; even if you don't have, they don't want to know.

0:19:46.740,0:19:52.560
But God used you to reconcile me with my husband, my family and children.

0:19:52.560,0:19:56.960
I want to thank you and thank God Almighty for using you to reconcile me.

0:19:56.960,0:20:03.440
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:20:03.440,0:20:08.580
Now, since I have been delivered from that spirit of snake -

0:20:08.580,0:20:13.060
on Tuesday when I went back to the lodge to sleep,

0:20:13.060,0:20:16.520
the snake tried to come whilst I was sleeping.

0:20:16.520,0:20:19.580
It was asking me, "Why are you doing this to me?

0:20:19.580,0:20:23.000
Why did you come to The SCOAN for them to deliver you?"

0:20:23.000,0:20:26.960
I tried to ask, "Who is that? Who is talking?"

0:20:26.960,0:20:32.020
And when I woke up, the snake disappeared; I didn't see it anymore.

0:20:32.020,0:20:35.180
Now I am delivered; I am free, in Jesus' name.

0:20:35.180,0:20:39.920
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:20:39.920,0:20:44.680
And ever since my deliverance, I can really hug my husband;

0:20:44.680,0:20:47.080
we can now talk like husband and wife;

0:20:47.080,0:20:50.480
we can now phone our children together, there is peace.

0:20:50.480,0:20:52.220
He keeps telling me that he loves me;

0:20:52.220,0:20:56.060
that we need to plan how to live together with the children in peace.

0:20:56.060,0:20:58.060
There is peace and joy.

0:20:58.060,0:21:06.100
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:21:06.100,0:21:10.000
People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:21:10.000,0:21:13.780
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:21:13.780,0:21:18.140
My name is Ndubuisi Chika Nwokoye.

0:21:18.140,0:21:25.740
I am from Oka, Anambra State, Nigeria.

0:21:25.740,0:21:36.640
I am very happy to stand before the people of God in this great arena of liberty.

0:21:36.640,0:21:42.500
The beautiful lady standing by my side is my lovely wife.

0:21:42.500,0:21:48.820
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:21:48.820,0:21:57.440
In June it will be 13 years that we've been married.

0:21:57.440,0:22:00.580
At first, it was love.

0:22:00.580,0:22:04.080
After five years, it became a war.

0:22:04.080,0:22:08.280
Because, you know where I come from, we believe in one thing -

0:22:08.280,0:22:11.120
that a woman never rules a man.

0:22:11.120,0:22:14.320
And when we go into marriage, we don't go in for love.

0:22:14.320,0:22:19.640
We go into marriage - I am an Igbo man - we go into marriage for children.

0:22:19.640,0:22:25.920
Even when the woman gives birth to only females and not males, it brings more war.

0:22:25.920,0:22:28.360
We don't look at the woman as the first thing.

0:22:28.360,0:22:32.380
We look at what she is producing for us because it is  like employment.

0:22:32.380,0:22:38.680
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:22:38.680,0:22:44.200
If a woman does not give birth to a child, that is another big war.

0:22:44.200,0:22:48.780
Another thing is that the woman must be under us - under our authority.

0:22:48.780,0:22:51.420
She mustn't have a choice of her own.

0:22:51.420,0:22:57.540
She must be obedient, respect us - when we are wrong or right.

0:22:57.540,0:23:06.300
Because, as far as I know, in Igbo land, the chief can never be wrong.

0:23:06.300,0:23:13.360
If a woman goes out, it is a problem for the woman. But if a man goes out, he is still right

0:23:13.360,0:23:18.240
because he can have 2 or 3 wifes, according to the tradition of Igbo land.

0:23:18.240,0:23:27.640
But it came to a time - you can be possessed but you won't know that you are possessed.

0:23:27.640,0:23:33.160
If someone came to tell me before my deliverance that I was possessed, I would tell the person, "Get out!"

0:23:33.160,0:23:36.320
Because everthing I was doing was very right in my view,

0:23:36.320,0:23:40.800
never knowing that I was possessed.

0:23:40.800,0:23:46.240
This war between my wife and I - it came to a time when I could not take it anymore.

0:23:46.240,0:23:50.640
I said to myself, I have gone everywhere; I have gone to so many churches,

0:23:50.640,0:23:53.220
deliverance upon deliverance, but this woman is still the same.

0:23:53.220,0:23:55.660
I made the decision to take another wife

0:23:55.660,0:23:59.460
because in my place, we believe that if you want to quench a fire

0:23:59.460,0:24:03.860
of a woman in the house, marry another woman on top of her.

0:24:03.860,0:24:10.560
Then the war will leave you and be between her and the other lady that you are bringing in.

0:24:10.560,0:24:16.060
So, I told my wife that I was going to Nigeria for holiday, to visit my friends and family

0:24:16.060,0:24:21.200
but she didn't know that I was coming to Nigeria to look for a new wife.

0:24:21.200,0:24:24.800
As I was searching for this new wife in Nigeria,

0:24:24.800,0:24:33.900
I never knew that this woman that I had left in South Africa had landed at The SCOAN.

0:24:33.900,0:24:43.120
As I was here in Nigeria, in my hometown Oka, looking around, enjoying myself,

0:24:43.120,0:24:47.060
moving about as someone who is celebrating New Year and Christmas together,

0:24:47.060,0:24:49.800
looking for a new wife,

0:24:49.800,0:24:53.280
all the women I was seeing, I was comparing them with my wife,

0:24:53.280,0:25:01.440
I never saw someone as beautiful as her. I wanted to beat her with another beautiful one.

0:25:01.440,0:25:07.180
So, as time was going on, it happened on Sunday that I phoned my home in South Africa.

0:25:07.180,0:25:11.760
I asked my children, "Where is my wife?" They said that they didn't know her whereabouts.

0:25:11.760,0:25:14.820
In the evening I called back again. I asked, "Is she back?" They said, "No".

0:25:14.820,0:25:16.500
I asked, "What is happening?"

0:25:16.500,0:25:25.060
On Sunday, people started calling me that they saw my wife on Emmanuel TV.

0:25:25.060,0:25:28.400
I was shocked because I never knew about it.

0:25:28.400,0:25:30.100
I asked, "What happened?"

0:25:30.100,0:25:31.740
They said that they saw her.

0:25:31.740,0:25:34.380
Okay. I kept quiet.

0:25:34.380,0:25:41.100
On Monday, a call came from The SCOAN that they needed to see me here.

0:25:41.100,0:25:45.460
They said that the man of God wanted to see me.

0:25:45.460,0:25:48.020
That is a call I cannot say no to.

0:25:48.020,0:25:53.120
The way I was angry, I even said that I didn't want her forever.

0:25:53.120,0:25:57.400
Before I was hiding, then I was telling her openly, "No more!

0:25:57.400,0:26:02.440
Although you knew it before but now I'm telling you very openly that I don't want you forever".

0:26:02.440,0:26:05.620
She kept quiet; she didn't even answer.

0:26:05.620,0:26:10.820
If it were before, when I said something, she would answer with fire.

0:26:10.820,0:26:15.300
Okay. If it were the mother that called me, she knows I would not come.

0:26:15.300,0:26:19.460
Or her father or any of her relations.

0:26:19.460,0:26:22.820
But this was a call that touched my life.

0:26:22.820,0:26:26.580
The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, is someone that

0:26:26.580,0:26:31.500
when I watch him on Emmanuel TV, my body is shaking.

0:26:31.500,0:26:34.420
So I couldn't say no.

0:26:34.420,0:26:39.300
I took my car, called my friends and said, "I'm going to The SCOAN on Saturday

0:26:39.300,0:26:44.500
because a call came from here that they needed me".

0:26:44.500,0:26:48.180
When I came here, I didn't want to see my wife's face.

0:26:48.180,0:26:52.520
I was so angry because in my mind I said,

0:26:52.520,0:26:56.780
"Whatever happens, I have taken the decision - I need a new wife".

0:26:56.780,0:27:02.780
So, I said, "Man of God, whatever you say, I will accept it because I know that you hear directly from God".

0:27:02.780,0:27:06.920
The man of God told me that this marriage is from God.

0:27:06.920,0:27:09.740
That calmed me down - number 1.

0:27:09.740,0:27:16.040
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:27:16.040,0:27:23.700
Number 2 - that same Sunday evening, I went to the prayer line

0:27:23.700,0:27:26.400
where the man of God is delivering people.

0:27:26.400,0:27:30.200
When I was coming, I was myself.

0:27:30.200,0:27:34.200
Arriving there, immediately the man of God raised his hand,

0:27:34.200,0:27:37.880
I went back; I don't know what happened to me.

0:27:37.880,0:27:39.880
I fell under the anointing.

0:27:39.880,0:27:41.660
I said to myself, "Ah, am I myself?"

0:27:41.660,0:27:46.920
I wanted to stand up but there was no strength. I fell back again.

0:27:46.920,0:27:50.680
My head was as if it was divided into two.

0:27:50.680,0:27:56.140
This side is talking one thing; the other side is talking another thing.

0:27:56.140,0:28:00.100
So, I couldn't get myself very well.

0:28:00.100,0:28:04.580
After the deliverance, when I went to the place

0:28:04.580,0:28:08.620
where the man of God gave us to stay for free,

0:28:08.620,0:28:12.280
I told my wife, "Still now, I don't know what is happening to me!

0:28:12.280,0:28:18.520
My head is still divided. This one this side; this one talking another thing but I will see".

0:28:18.520,0:28:20.260
Then I fell asleep.

0:28:20.260,0:28:24.040
When I woke up in the morning, I looked at my wife.

0:28:24.040,0:28:27.720
She looked so young and beautiful.

0:28:27.720,0:28:32.160
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:28:32.160,0:28:36.200
I said to myself, ""Wow! Is it a mistake that I should make?"

0:28:36.200,0:28:43.180
So this girl I came to look for in Nigeria is still the same one I left in South Africa

0:28:43.180,0:28:46.320
that came here beautiful like this.

0:28:46.320,0:28:53.620
I said to myself, "Now I know that I really need deliverance; I am possessed".

0:28:53.620,0:28:56.760
Because so many things I was doing before,

0:28:56.760,0:29:00.440
I see it was wrong - wrong after wrong.

0:29:00.440,0:29:04.240
I asked myself, "Was it me doing this?" I was shocked.

0:29:04.240,0:29:07.080
I said to my wife, "Please forgive me!

0:29:07.080,0:29:10.380
Whatever wrong I have done to you before, forgive me!

0:29:10.380,0:29:14.720
I was not using my real eye. I had eyes then but I could not see.

0:29:14.720,0:29:18.300
Now that I can see clearly, you are beautiful!"

0:29:18.300,0:29:24.580
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:29:24.580,0:29:30.260
From that day, every day she is looking new,

0:29:30.260,0:29:34.860
more than new, more than beautiful.

0:29:34.860,0:29:40.880
I said, "Ay!" Today I stand in this great arena to ask the people of God

0:29:40.880,0:29:47.440
to thank the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, for me.

0:29:47.440,0:29:49.860
He really reconciled my wife and I.

0:29:49.860,0:29:55.060
I am very happy and I promise that I will love her more and more.

0:29:55.060,0:32:17.500
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:32:17.500,0:32:23.800
My advice to people, married people, all over the world

0:32:23.800,0:32:28.120
that are having a similar problem to what I encountered before

0:32:28.120,0:32:33.140
is that never say no when you enter into marriage.

0:32:33.140,0:32:36.360
Think of the heart that you wanted to break.

0:32:36.360,0:32:42.220
It is really not your heart but someone's that came from her parents' house to be with you.

0:32:42.220,0:32:48.580
Remember what God said that the woman will leave her mother and father,

0:32:48.580,0:32:52.680
join with a man and they will become one.

0:32:52.680,0:32:55.760
Whatever you encounter, never say no.

0:32:55.760,0:32:58.880
If it is so much for you that you cannot carry,

0:32:58.880,0:33:07.660
know that there is a place - the arena of liberty - where your problem can be solved.

0:33:07.660,0:33:11.380
Try, make your way to The SCOAN1

0:33:11.380,0:33:17.120
When you arrive here, I know that the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:33:17.120,0:33:21.520
that visited me and delivered me will surely do it for you.

0:33:21.520,0:33:29.200
Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony

0:33:29.200,0:33:34.920
My advice to the whole world and to married couples is that

0:33:34.920,0:33:38.200
we should always seek the face of God.

0:33:38.200,0:33:42.300
I know women would be saying that I don't know what I'm talking about.

0:33:42.300,0:33:45.880
But I went through so many pains; I've been there; I have done that.

0:33:45.880,0:33:49.180
Please, don't ever feel like leaving your home.

0:33:49.180,0:33:54.100
Just stay strong and help your husband. He might not know what he is doing

0:33:54.100,0:33:58.200
Be it you are a man and it is your wife that is misbehaving.

0:33:58.200,0:34:01.040
Be strong and believe in God.

0:34:01.040,0:34:04.740
Tell yourself that you will come together and find a solution.

0:34:04.740,0:34:10.640
And the advice I give is that the arena of liberty - The SCOAN -

0:34:10.640,0:34:18.420
whatever it will cost you, just land here and God will see you through.

0:34:18.420,0:34:22.360
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:34:22.360,0:34:25.440
People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:34:25.440,0:34:29.800
My name is Mrs Angel Nwokoye.

0:34:29.800,0:34:35.560
The man standing beside me is my husband, Mr Chika Ndubuisi Nwokoye.

0:34:35.560,0:34:42.480
We are here by the grace of God to testify for what God did in our lives,

0:34:42.480,0:34:50.240
concerning the reconciliation when I came to The SCOAN on January 15th.

0:34:50.240,0:34:56.200
I want to thank God because today, there is peace through the reconciliation;

0:34:56.200,0:34:59.520
there is peace and love between my husband and I.

0:34:59.520,0:35:02.280
Our children are happy, we are living happily

0:35:02.280,0:35:07.880
and I thank God and I thank Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua for allowing God to use him

0:35:07.880,0:35:10.280
to reconcile this marriage.

0:35:10.280,0:35:13.660
The situation was really terrible

0:35:13.660,0:35:16.840
but I thank God that I've been delivered

0:35:16.840,0:35:20.120
and now I'm fully happy in my marriage.

0:35:20.120,0:35:26.300
My name is Mr Ndubuisi Chika Nwokoye.

0:35:26.300,0:35:31.740
I'm from Oka, the capital of Anambra State, Nigeria.

0:35:31.740,0:35:40.240
The woman standing beside me is my lovely wife, Angel Nwokoye.

0:35:40.240,0:35:47.580
People of God, this is something I don't know how to explain.

0:35:47.580,0:35:54.320
It is something that is wonderful; something I have tried by all means to use my power.

0:35:54.320,0:36:01.860
I prayed to the Lord, fasted a lot but nothing worked. I became frustrated.

0:36:01.860,0:36:06.480
That is why I began to hate my wife the more

0:36:06.480,0:36:11.340
because when things were happening, I thought I could correct one or two,

0:36:11.340,0:36:13.340
but nothing was happening.

0:36:13.340,0:36:18.720
When I came here in January, I was invited by Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:36:18.720,0:36:22.360
I came here - it was wonderful.

0:36:22.360,0:36:27.920
That touch of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua changed everything in my life;

0:36:27.920,0:36:29.920
changed everything in my family;

0:36:29.920,0:36:36.080
changed everything that I thought could not be done.

0:36:36.080,0:36:39.060
You know before, I didn't know my children much.

0:36:39.060,0:36:44.160
I always liked to stay out at night.

0:36:44.160,0:36:47.760
At day time, I would not come in.

0:36:47.760,0:36:51.080
Night time - that is when I loved to go out.

0:36:51.080,0:36:58.200
I spent my time in the bar, with friends and doing all sorts of rubbish,

0:36:58.200,0:37:02.480
not knowing that the real joy is my family.

0:37:02.480,0:37:07.700
That the real joy is to stay, to know my children and my wife.

0:37:07.700,0:37:12.680
After the touch of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua - wow!

0:37:12.680,0:37:16.060
It was something that I cannot explain.

0:37:16.060,0:37:25.460
I began to enjoy staying at home, studying my children and staying with my wife.

0:37:25.460,0:37:29.420
In fact, I was in marriage but I was not in love before.

0:37:29.420,0:37:37.580
But now, I have come back with love; my marriage has become sweet.

0:37:37.580,0:37:41.880
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!

0:37:41.880,0:37:44.100
My life became sweet.

0:37:44.100,0:37:46.580
My marriage became sweet.

0:37:46.580,0:37:50.520
My children, everything around me became sweet.

0:37:50.520,0:38:01.160
In fact, another thing  - poverty that was following me disappeared.

0:38:01.160,0:38:04.840
Before, it was hand to mouth.

0:38:04.840,0:38:11.620
All the things I was bragging about was just a brag because no man paid.

0:38:11.620,0:38:18.260
But after the touch of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, wonders started happening.

0:38:18.260,0:38:27.060
My father, Chika Nwokoye, 90 years old, passed away.

0:38:27.060,0:38:31.340
But you know in Igbo land, to bury someone is not an easy something.

0:38:31.340,0:38:33.960
Espcially an old man - a celebration of life.

0:38:33.960,0:38:39.960
But when I looked around, what God had given me after I visited The SCOAN,

0:38:39.960,0:38:44.480
I smiled because I was loaded.

0:38:44.480,0:38:47.560
Wow! To God be the glory!

0:38:47.560,0:38:51.640
I can see that our brother is full of joy.

0:38:51.640,0:38:57.820
My advice to people is that every man that is in marriage,

0:38:57.820,0:39:01.260
please know it that marriage is of God.

0:39:01.260,0:39:05.180
If you encounter what I have encountered, don't chase your wife away.

0:39:05.180,0:39:08.920
Don't go and take another wife.

0:39:08.920,0:39:15.600
Consult God and you will see that God is in The SCOAN.

0:39:15.600,0:39:20.040
God will do the same thing in your life that he has done for me.

0:39:20.040,0:39:23.060
I'm so grateful; I'm so happy.

0:39:23.060,0:39:27.260
Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus!

0:39:27.260,0:39:31.520
Wow! To God be the glory! We thank God Almighty, and we also want to advise you

0:39:31.520,0:39:37.120
and encourage you as you rightly said, don't run from God but rather run to God

0:39:37.120,0:39:42.420
because He is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.

0:39:42.420,0:39:44.620
Never a problem he cannot solve

0:39:44.620,0:39:49.260
because He has given that spirit of reconciliation to reconcile families,

0:39:49.260,0:39:53.880
to reconcile nations and to reconcile the whole world.

0:39:53.880,0:39:56.500
