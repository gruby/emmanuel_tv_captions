0:00:00.080,0:00:08.020
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:08.020,0:00:17.100
You see me every day, and still, each time you see me, you start screaming.

0:00:17.100,0:00:22.840
I am supposed to scream too because I usually see you occasionally...

0:00:22.840,0:00:25.360
Not all the time I used to see you...

0:00:25.360,0:00:29.840
But you see me every day - every time you see me, you still scream...

0:00:29.840,0:00:36.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:36.080,0:00:42.960
What will I believe now? Will I believe this screaming?

0:00:42.960,0:00:48.520
Will I believe all this screaming and close my eyes? - I have to open one eye.

0:00:48.520,0:00:51.280
This your screaming every day!

0:00:51.280,0:01:00.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:00.260,0:01:07.680
I understand. You are inspired.

0:01:07.680,0:01:10.980
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:01:10.980,0:01:12.980
You are inspired.

0:01:12.980,0:01:20.240
I know that when one is inspired, you just see him laughing whereas there is nothing to laugh about.

0:01:20.240,0:01:25.760
Happy Mother's Day!

0:01:25.760,0:01:28.180
Hallelujah!

0:01:28.180,0:01:31.280
I thank God that I am not alone here.

0:01:31.280,0:01:34.200
If I was alone, I would feel shy.

0:01:34.200,0:01:38.420
I am not alone; I am in the midst of millions of people.

0:01:38.420,0:01:42.900
Can you see any one of them?

0:01:42.900,0:01:48.180
There are millions of people here. I'm not alone. That is why when you scream, I'm not moved.

0:01:48.180,0:01:53.180
Hallelujah. I was dancing and rejoicing with you. I watched testimonies.

0:01:53.180,0:01:59.820
It got to a stage when the Lord said, "Go out, it is time for you to attend to the people".

0:01:59.820,0:02:02.020
I said, "Lord, thank You".

0:02:02.020,0:02:08.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:08.240,0:02:16.840
Do we still have anyone that is going through satan's torture?

0:02:16.840,0:02:22.360
Satan tortures people with worry about now and the future.

0:02:22.360,0:02:25.800
When you are under that, you are under torture.

0:02:25.800,0:02:29.460
You understand what I´m saying? You may not know what I am talking about when I say,

0:02:29.460,0:02:34.420
"Do we have anyone that is going through satan's torture?"

0:02:34.420,0:02:38.000
That is when you begin to think, "I'm worried";

0:02:38.000,0:02:41.740
"Will I be healed?"; "How will I pay that debt?";

0:02:41.740,0:02:46.040
"When are we leaving here? I think I will not miss my flight."

0:02:46.040,0:02:52.120
So anxious and desperate.

0:02:52.120,0:02:53.680
A lot of people have been dancing.

0:02:53.680,0:02:58.000
You look around and see some of your neighbours - they refused to dance

0:02:58.000,0:03:03.820
because maybe, they are waiting for their testimony.

0:03:03.820,0:03:08.800
They say, "Until I have my testimony, I will not dance".

0:03:08.800,0:03:16.580
If you are waiting for your own testimony, definitely, that testimony may never come

0:03:16.580,0:03:23.120
because the pain of one is the pain of all, and the joy of one is the joy of all. Tell your neighbour.

0:03:23.120,0:03:28.380
The pain of one is the pain of all, and the joy of one is the joy of all.

0:03:28.380,0:03:29.780
I can´t hear you.

0:03:29.780,0:03:34.520
The pain of one is the pain of all, and the joy of one is the joy of all.

0:03:34.520,0:03:40.620
As a Christian, when you see your neighbour happy, join them.

0:03:40.620,0:03:43.040
You don't need to wait until you are happy.

0:03:43.040,0:03:49.100
You say, "They are giving testimony - until it happens to me!"

0:03:49.100,0:03:56.540
Some people just believe that, "Something must happen to me. If it has happened to me, it has happened.

0:03:56.540,0:04:00.680
If it has not happened to me, it has not happened".

0:04:00.680,0:04:04.420
They say, "Oh no, testimony. I am waiting for my own testimony".

0:04:04.420,0:04:09.600
That is not a good language for Christians.

0:04:09.600,0:04:14.780
The question I am even asking is, "Are you going through satan's torture?

0:04:14.780,0:04:21.100
So anxious, sad, depressed, worried about now and the future?"

0:04:21.100,0:04:29.760
"How will I be healed? I mean, I´m owing debt."

0:04:29.760,0:04:36.240
"My marriage, my health, my career!" - so anxious.

0:04:36.240,0:04:46.140
In the book of  Matthew 4:2, our Saviour, after 40 days and 40 nights,

0:04:46.140,0:04:51.740
He was hungry but not desperate.

0:04:51.740,0:04:55.000
No, he was very, very hungry.

0:04:55.000,0:05:03.500
Very, very hungry, after 40 days, 40 nights, but  not desperate, not anxious.

0:05:03.500,0:05:09.760
Because He was not anxious, that is why He did not fall into satan's trap.

0:05:09.760,0:05:15.280
Jesus did not fall into satan's trap because He was not what? - He was not desperate.

0:05:15.280,0:05:18.200
But today, many...

0:05:18.200,0:05:25.240
When you act so desperate, you will not mind where solution comes from.

0:05:25.240,0:05:34.000
When you are desperate, you will not mind God's time and God's time is the best.

0:05:34.000,0:05:42.980
"No, I just need it now. I'm so and so. I´m looking for a job. No, I don´t mind."

0:05:42.980,0:05:46.860
- when you are desperate, anxious.

0:05:46.860,0:05:48.940
Are you going through that?

0:05:48.940,0:05:51.560
God's time is the best. Tell your neighbour.

0:05:51.560,0:05:53.280
God's time is the best.

0:05:53.280,0:05:54.440
I can´t hear you.

0:05:54.440,0:05:56.040
God's time is the best.

0:05:56.040,0:06:01.220
At God's time, things look beautiful.

0:06:01.220,0:06:03.440
The right time.

0:06:03.440,0:06:09.860
When you receive something at God's time, it lasts forever.

0:06:09.860,0:06:14.440
What you need most, it´s there.

0:06:14.440,0:06:16.040
Don't be desperate. Tell your neighbour.

0:06:16.040,0:06:17.280
Don't be desperate.

0:06:17.280,0:06:18.440
I can´t hear you...

0:06:18.440,0:06:19.660
Don't be desperate.

0:06:19.660,0:06:32.280
The language of people that are desperate is, "I'm waiting for my testimony".

0:06:32.280,0:06:38.660
When they see people rejoice, they look to the other side.

0:06:38.660,0:06:44.020
They look to the other side, when they see people in church.

0:06:44.020,0:06:45.720
"Oh, why are you dancing?"

0:06:45.720,0:06:54.840
"Oh, testimony. I too have the same issue. I´m waiting for my own testimony."

0:06:54.840,0:06:59.120
That is when you´ll be happy.

0:06:59.120,0:07:01.860
Oh.

0:07:01.860,0:07:06.760
You have to rejoice with those who rejoice.

0:07:06.760,0:07:14.420
If not, your day of joy may never what? - May never come.

0:07:14.420,0:07:18.240
Each message is life-changing.

0:07:18.240,0:07:20.760
I am happy because you are  happy..

0:07:20.760,0:07:23.160
Are you not happy?

0:07:23.160,0:07:28.920
Because I´m seeing you happy.  You say what?

0:07:28.920,0:07:36.680
You're happy. You should not wait until it has happened to you, okay?

0:07:36.680,0:07:42.440
When you see your colleagues happy because of what God has done,

0:07:42.440,0:07:44.760
that is testimony for you.

0:07:44.760,0:07:50.280
What happens to your colleague is meant to build your faith.

0:07:50.280,0:07:54.380
What happened to me is meant to build your faith

0:07:54.380,0:07:59.720
and what happened to you is also meant to build my faith.

0:07:59.720,0:08:03.280
God is great!

0:08:03.280,0:08:05.160
Hallelujah!

0:08:05.160,0:08:09.420
We want to go to the sick ones.

0:08:09.420,0:08:14.200
Each issue brings revelation.

0:08:14.200,0:08:17.700
And as we share it together, we learn.

0:08:17.700,0:08:24.300
Like I have said, what will happen to anyone here is meant to build your faith;

0:08:24.300,0:08:27.460
it enhances your faith.

0:08:27.460,0:08:30.960
So when people say, "Thank You Jesus!",

0:08:30.960,0:08:39.180
you are looking to see what happened to the person before you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:08:39.180,0:08:46.260
That is why you say:  "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:08:46.260,0:08:51.540
When you now see what happens, you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:08:51.540,0:08:53.460
It is time to attend to them.

0:08:53.460,0:09:01.440
Viewers at home, I know you will see acts of mercy of God today;

0:09:01.440,0:09:08.580
acts of healing of God - you will see them clearly, in Jesus' name.

0:09:08.580,0:09:09.760
Thank you.

0:09:09.760,0:09:15.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:15.660,0:09:24.680
What is going on in your heart when you see people with bandages, braces, this and that?

0:09:24.680,0:09:29.480
I believe strongly that they have an appointment with God today and God is going to work.

0:09:29.480,0:09:31.340
Their pain is your pain.

0:09:31.340,0:09:33.240
Yes.

0:09:33.240,0:09:37.660
When you see their pain, it is your pain.

0:09:37.660,0:09:41.560
So when we start praying, you join us in prayer as well.

0:09:41.560,0:09:42.420
Yes.

0:09:42.420,0:09:45.320
When I say, "Be healed!", your heart too should say, "Be healed!"

0:09:45.320,0:09:46.040
Yes, Man of God.

0:09:46.040,0:09:49.400
When the person is healed, it means your prayer and my prayer made it happen.

0:09:49.400,0:09:50.720
Yes, Man of God.

0:09:50.720,0:09:57.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:57.220,0:10:04.120
What does it mean to you when you see people with different gadgets?

0:10:04.120,0:10:09.360
Man of God, like you said, it means that man is born into trouble.

0:10:09.360,0:10:10.980
Man is born into trouble.

0:10:10.980,0:10:11.600
Yes.

0:10:11.600,0:10:15.080
Ah, I´m afraid of you!

0:10:15.080,0:10:19.400
This man! Your word is pregnant.

0:10:19.400,0:10:24.400
Let me ask again. I don't know what he wants to say again.

0:10:24.400,0:10:25.740
Man of God...

0:10:25.740,0:10:28.380
Ah! In each word, you keep saying "Man of God".

0:10:28.380,0:10:29.040
Yes.

0:10:29.040,0:10:31.080
Why can't you go straight to the point?

0:10:31.080,0:10:35.960
You said, "Man of God, man is born into trouble".  Am I the one that born you into trouble?

0:10:35.960,0:10:39.800
Man of God, that is why you are sent to us

0:10:39.800,0:10:44.660
because Christ is in you and you are in Christ.

0:10:44.660,0:10:46.940
But you too. You are sent to me.

0:10:46.940,0:10:49.800
Man of God, each time I see you, I see Christ in you.

0:10:49.800,0:10:54.180
Each time I see you, I see Christ with a crown.

0:10:54.180,0:10:58.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:58.340,0:11:04.120
My brother, you have said it all. He said, "Man is born into trouble".

0:11:04.120,0:11:11.460
Each time you are facing challenges, you should know it is a way of life.

0:11:11.460,0:11:17.880
Stop saying "witches and wizards" instead of facing it.

0:11:17.880,0:11:25.760
Man is born into trouble.
Thank you very much. Clap for him.

0:11:25.760,0:11:30.040
So sister, how does the whole thing appeal to you?

0:11:30.040,0:11:32.620
Like their pain is my pain.

0:11:32.620,0:11:37.980
I should put myself in their position.

0:11:37.980,0:11:40.920
Put yourself in their position.

0:11:40.920,0:11:41.940
Yes.

0:11:41.940,0:11:45.940
When it is time for prayer, what is your position?

0:11:45.940,0:11:47.220
To pray for them too.

0:11:47.220,0:11:48.940
You pray; you join us in prayer.

0:11:48.940,0:11:49.640
Amen.

0:11:49.640,0:11:53.820
When the miracle happens, you know your prayer has been answered.

0:11:53.820,0:11:54.720
Amen.

0:11:54.720,0:11:58.780
Viewers at home, join me in prayer.

0:11:58.780,0:12:05.260
So when I stretch my hand, if you cannot stretch your hand, stretch your heart.

0:12:05.260,0:12:10.280
When I say, "In Jesus' name!", you too say after me, "In Jesus' name!"

0:12:10.280,0:12:24.860
And when the miracle happens, it happens because two believers are better than one.

0:12:24.860,0:12:35.620
Man of God, I experience difficulty in walking due to degeneration of disc disease.

0:12:35.620,0:12:43.300
I´m using a lumbar corset and lumbar body support to help me suppress the pain.

0:12:43.300,0:12:50.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:50.480,0:12:52.820
So you use a lot of tablets.

0:12:52.820,0:12:54.420
To suppress the pain.

0:12:54.420,0:12:58.480
So it is time to pray, ok?

0:12:58.480,0:13:01.860
So this is a Spirit prayer.

0:13:01.860,0:13:04.880
Prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:13:04.880,0:13:06.880
Be delivered, in Jesus' name!

I have shortness of breath.

0:13:50.340,0:13:54.820
I have been using a breathing machine to assist me with my breathing for two years now.

0:13:54.820,0:13:56.140
From where?

0:13:56.140,0:13:58.980
I´m from South Africa.

0:13:58.980,0:14:00.940
What is this?

0:14:00.940,0:14:01.940
It's an oxygen machine.

0:14:01.940,0:14:02.920
So you came with her?

0:14:02.920,0:14:03.780
Yes.

0:14:03.780,0:14:05.580
Ok, it's alright. Stand at the back.

Please help me, Man of God. This is the nebuliser that I use; it helps me to breathe.

I'm from America. I use this machine because I am suffering from high blood pressure,

gout, and hemorrhoids. I can´t sleep without this machine.

0:21:21.000,0:21:28.460
The doctor told me that if I don't use this machine, I will become paralysed and will die.

Healed Of Anus Cancer In Jesus' Name

0:23:47.860,0:23:52.740
Ok. To God be the glory! This is a brother who had the problem of anus cancer.

0:23:52.740,0:23:57.080
The doctors condemned my anus and on Thursday I was supposed to go for the third operation.

0:23:57.080,0:24:00.920
They said it was cancer of the anus and they would open part of my belly,

0:24:00.920,0:24:04.240
where I would be passing out my faeces a lifetime.

0:24:04.240,0:24:11.020
So, I left the hospital on Wednesday. From Bayelsa, I had to come to Lagos.

0:24:11.020,0:24:15.840
What happened to you now that caused this amazement? You're so surprised.

0:24:15.840,0:24:21.920
After the prayers, I am healed; I can sit now.

0:24:21.920,0:24:23.540
What about the pain?

0:24:23.540,0:24:26.620
The pain - it's gone!

0:24:26.620,0:24:28.580
Can you sit now? Sit and tell us...

0:24:28.580,0:24:32.900
Thank You, Jesus!

0:24:32.900,0:24:35.860
We thank God for His goodness in the life of the young man here.

0:24:35.860,0:24:39.460
You heard him. He said he has undergone two major operations

0:24:39.460,0:24:44.720
and he was booked for a third operation, before he proceeded on the journey to The SCOAN.

0:24:44.720,0:24:48.740
He said he could not sit at all for the past one year.

0:24:48.740,0:24:52.780
But after the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, touched him, he said the pain is gone.

0:24:52.780,0:24:56.860
For the first time in one year, he is sitting now, to the glory of God.

0:24:56.860,0:24:59.920
God of T.B. Joshua, thank You!

0:24:59.920,0:25:04.460
You heard this man saying that he had not slept for one year. See him sleeping.

0:25:04.460,0:25:08.480
That is to show that he received a touch of God, in Jesus' name.
