Recovering addicts sponsored by Emmanuel TV at the Lighthouse Recovery Center

0:00:08.060,0:00:12.900
We are thankful for this opportunity to be here with a very special brother.

0:00:12.900,0:00:14.600
Brother, can you first tell us your name?

0:00:14.600,0:00:17.220
Timothy.

0:00:17.220,0:00:23.460
We thank you, Emmanuel TV because this gives us the opportunity to hear from other people.

0:00:23.460,0:00:29.380
Their testimonies help reroute people who are going through rough times in life.

0:00:29.380,0:00:33.420
Brother, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?

0:00:33.420,0:00:38.220
As a kid, I grew up with my grandmother and I was really sheltered.

0:00:38.220,0:00:41.300
I never even heard a curse word.

0:00:41.300,0:00:45.220
When I was 11, she passed away.

0:00:45.220,0:00:48.940
After she passed away, I had to go and live with my mother.

0:00:48.940,0:00:54.200
Living there was a total environment change.

0:00:54.200,0:00:58.640
When I opened her closet, I would see 200 to 300 pounds of drugs.

0:00:58.640,0:01:00.540
It was her husband and hers.

0:01:00.540,0:01:02.820
There were guns around and there was violence.

0:01:02.820,0:01:04.060
How old were you?

0:01:04.060,0:01:06.020
I was 11 years old.

0:01:06.020,0:01:11.060
I was scared and didn’t know how to take it – the violence at home.

0:01:11.060,0:01:14.200
I ran away the week after I turned 13.

0:01:14.200,0:01:17.240
When I ran away, it was hard.

0:01:17.240,0:01:26.960
I became a petty thief and went on to what I saw at my mother’s house – drugs.

0:01:26.960,0:01:32.300
I did a lot of things with drugs and I made an older friend.

0:01:32.300,0:01:36.380
While hanging out with him, I learned a very important lesson quickly.

0:01:36.380,0:01:40.460
That is not to judge people on the streets because it is bad.

0:01:40.460,0:01:44.180
I hung out with him for about a year and half.

0:01:44.180,0:01:50.300
I would have bet everything I had in life that he would never be violent.

0:01:50.300,0:01:56.920
One day, we were in a situation where he pulled out a gun and shot somebody in front of me.

0:01:56.920,0:01:59.000
I was wrong.

0:01:59.000,0:02:04.460
That was a lesson I learnt because I was on the streets.

0:02:04.460,0:02:07.480
After that, it became a recurring thing.

0:02:07.480,0:02:10.180
He shot so many people in front of me, I thought it was normal.

0:02:10.180,0:02:12.500
Living in that background, I thought it was legal.

0:02:12.500,0:02:14.940
I’ve got gangster tattoos all over my arms.

0:02:14.940,0:02:22.740
Somehow, I went from an inspired kid to having my motivation change; I wanted to be a gangster.

0:02:22.740,0:02:26.780
About 25, that was when I really started carrying a gun.

0:02:26.780,0:02:30.760
I actually started carrying it when I was 20 but I didn’t understand what I was doing.

0:02:30.760,0:02:36.580
When I was 25, I started putting it to work.

0:02:36.580,0:02:41.100
Friends that I knew started noticing me and what I was doing.

0:02:41.100,0:02:45.880
They came to me and wanted me to collect some money for them.

0:02:45.880,0:02:53.340
The amount I collected went up; it went up to a couple thousand dollars, then 6,000-7,000 dollars.

0:02:53.340,0:02:57.820
The next thing I knew, it was 15,000 to 50,000 dollars.

0:02:57.820,0:03:02.820
I have always been a little guy.

0:03:02.820,0:03:06.500
For me to walk up to someone and expect them to pay their debts -

0:03:06.500,0:03:11.860
they already knew that the people they were messing with were no joke.

0:03:11.860,0:03:16.000
I had to put a little more use to the gun.

0:03:16.000,0:03:20.700
So, what does that mean?
What did you end up having to do?

0:03:20.700,0:03:23.260
I shot a lot of people.

0:03:23.260,0:03:32.100
I wasn’t a killer but with my common sense, I could say that I was always smart.

0:03:32.100,0:03:35.900
Maybe I wasn’t smart at that time but I felt like I could shoot someone in the foot

0:03:35.900,0:03:39.860
to get my point across and I didn’t have to worry about anyone dying.

0:03:39.860,0:03:42.660
I would shoot them in their hand or whatever it may be.

0:03:42.660,0:03:45.460
So, that was what I started doing.

0:03:45.460,0:03:47.580
Let me ask you this; how did that affect you?

0:03:47.580,0:03:48.940
How did it come back upon you?

0:03:48.940,0:03:51.760
Did you end up facing death at some point?

0:03:51.760,0:03:54.300
Yes, over the years as my name got bigger and bigger

0:03:54.300,0:04:00.980
and I started grabbing more money for people, I ended up getting shot.

0:04:00.980,0:04:02.820
I have been shot five different times.

0:04:02.820,0:04:08.380
I got shot right between my eyes by a 9mm gun from five feet away.

0:04:08.380,0:04:12.620
You were shot by a 9mm gun right between the eyes?

0:04:12.620,0:04:14.980
Right here is where it went in.

0:04:14.980,0:04:18.540
Behind the forehead, there is a plate that protects the brain.

0:04:18.540,0:04:22.200
It went through my forehead, hit the plate, went down and broke my jaw,

0:04:22.200,0:04:29.140
went back up through my eye, shattered my eye socket and then the bullet went into my temple.

0:04:29.140,0:04:33.200
Pieces of the bullet are still in there now.

0:04:33.200,0:04:38.380
I checked out of the hospital three days later and was right back at it.

0:04:38.380,0:04:43.260
I took a bullet like a trophy.

0:04:43.260,0:04:46.220
When I set my mind on something, I went for it.

0:04:46.220,0:04:50.480
At that time, I was building a reputation; I was one of the toughest guys in the area.

0:04:50.480,0:05:01.040
The enemy would actually blind us to even death; where we not even fear death that much.

0:05:01.040,0:05:04.160
I had no fear of death; I accepted it.

0:05:04.160,0:05:07.020
I got so deep in it that I accepted it.

0:05:07.020,0:05:10.920
Tell me now what led you here to the Lighthouse.

0:05:10.920,0:05:16.760
One day, I received a letter and this letter was crystal clear.

0:05:16.760,0:05:24.380
This letter was talking about God and how good life is.

0:05:24.380,0:05:25.880
It brought me to tears.

0:05:25.880,0:05:29.500
When I got out of prison, the Lighthouse Recovery Center accepted me.

0:05:29.500,0:05:33.740
When I came here, it was hard at first to adjust

0:05:33.740,0:05:37.500
because I was coming from a circle full of very dark people.

0:05:37.500,0:05:38.780
How long have you been here?

0:05:38.780,0:05:42.640
I have been here for six and a half months now.

0:05:42.640,0:05:48.100
When I got here, I picked up the Bible and started doing one-on-one therapy.

0:05:48.100,0:05:50.480
I realised all the errors in my thinking.

0:05:50.480,0:05:54.620
I just worked really hard and now I am in leadership.

0:05:54.620,0:05:58.980
Emmanuel TV is sponsoring us here at the Lighthouse Recovery Center.

0:05:58.980,0:06:00.720
This place is changing lives.

0:06:00.720,0:06:05.260
It’s not like every other rehab or drug programme.

0:06:05.260,0:06:09.020
This one involves God and I believe that is a very important thing.

0:06:09.020,0:06:12.380
It involves God and we are recovering; all things are possible.

0:06:12.380,0:06:20.480
Recovering addicts sponsored by Emmanuel TV at the Lighthouse Recovery Center

0:06:20.480,0:06:22.740
We are here, at the Lighthouse Recovery Center.

0:06:22.740,0:06:24.940
We've got a very special brother.

0:06:24.940,0:06:30.240
This is an encouragement to all young people going through challenges.

0:06:30.240,0:06:36.320
Determination is what it takes to change your life.

0:06:36.320,0:06:38.100
Brother, tell me your name.

0:06:38.100,0:06:40.820
I'm Matthew.

0:06:40.820,0:06:42.700
I heard a very encouraging story about you.

0:06:42.700,0:06:47.800
Tell me a little bit about yourself and what led you to the Lighthouse.

0:06:47.800,0:06:51.980
When you become a part of the life of drugs and alcohol,

0:06:51.980,0:06:55.080
you find yourself walking around aimlessly.

0:06:55.080,0:06:56.860
At one point in my life, I had everything.

0:06:56.860,0:07:01.620
I had a wife; I had a son named Joshua.

0:07:01.620,0:07:07.260
All of that got taken away from me because of my choice to go to the world and do the wrong thing.

0:07:07.260,0:07:11.620
Depression really crept in and I found myself walking across intersections

0:07:11.620,0:07:14.660
because I just wanted to end my life.

0:07:14.660,0:07:18.760
I closed my eyes and just hoped that as I was walking across an intersection,

0:07:18.760,0:07:21.160
somebody would just run me over.

0:07:21.160,0:07:24.300
I did that on a daily basis.

0:07:24.300,0:07:26.460
But God didn’t allow that to happen.

0:07:26.460,0:07:31.300
I heard about the Lighthouse Recovery Center in a way that gave me hope.

0:07:31.300,0:07:35.100
I knew that if I could make it here, I could start afresh

0:07:35.100,0:07:37.220
and do something different with my life,

0:07:37.220,0:07:41.100
even though everything was taken away from me.

0:07:41.100,0:07:44.240
I had known God before and I knew He could do it again.

0:07:44.240,0:07:47.060
I knew that if I could make it here, I could breathe again.

0:07:47.060,0:07:52.760
So, what did it mean? Somebody went and picked you up, or somebody flew you out here?

0:07:52.760,0:07:54.840
Tell me what happened.

0:07:54.840,0:07:58.080
I was in Lexington, Kentucky.

0:07:58.080,0:08:03.700
I ended up in Lexington, Kentucky due to an extradition of child support -

0:08:03.700,0:08:05.320
neglecting to pay my child support.

0:08:05.320,0:08:07.960
They let me out within a week but it left me homeless in Lexington.

0:08:07.960,0:08:12.680
That was where depression really set in because I had nobody to call.

0:08:12.680,0:08:16.060
I knew if I could make it here, I would be alright.

0:08:16.060,0:08:17.460
How far is Lexington from here?

0:08:17.460,0:08:21.540
It’s about a three and a half hour car trip and I walked it.

0:08:21.540,0:08:26.740
Three and a half hour car-trip; and you walked all the way here - so it means walking...

0:08:26.740,0:08:29.440
...for 54 hours.

0:08:29.440,0:08:31.220
You walked 54 hours just to get here.

0:08:31.220,0:08:32.500
Yes.

0:08:32.500,0:08:34.880
Emmanuel! God is with us!

0:08:34.880,0:08:37.780
Now, this brother is here and his life is changed.

0:08:37.780,0:08:41.420
This is the reason it is so important for us to support ministries like this.

0:08:41.420,0:08:46.460
So, Emmanuel TV and Partners, thank you for your support.

0:08:46.460,0:08:48.660
Thank you, my brother.

0:08:48.660,0:08:52.620
Emmanuel. We are still here at the Lighthouse Recovery Center.

0:08:52.620,0:08:55.220
I've got a very special guest with us right now.

0:08:55.220,0:09:00.960
I'm just going to get him to start by telling us his name, and give us a little bit of his background,

0:09:00.960,0:09:06.700
his upbringing, challenges in life, and what led him here to the Lighthouse.

0:09:06.700,0:09:08.060
First, I will start by asking your name.

0:09:08.060,0:09:08.880
Brother, what's your name?

0:09:08.880,0:09:11.020
I'm Jamie.

0:09:11.020,0:09:12.000
Where are you from?

0:09:12.000,0:09:16.280
I'm from Bloomington, Indiana.

0:09:16.280,0:09:18.960
Let us know; we know that you are here at the Lighthouse,

0:09:18.960,0:09:23.720
and we heard that you are a very important part of Lighthouse.

0:09:23.720,0:09:30.500
Can you tell us a little bit about your background, and what led you here?

0:09:30.500,0:09:34.340
In John 5, you have the man at the pool of Bethesda.

0:09:34.340,0:09:37.080
Jesus didn’t just heal the man and tell him to get up and walk

0:09:37.080,0:09:40.320
but it was very significant that He told him to take his mat and walk.

0:09:40.320,0:09:42.800
It was a symbol of what he was delivered from.

0:09:42.800,0:09:45.940
Some of the things I was delivered from and got out of,

0:09:45.940,0:09:52.160
I now lift up as a testimony of what God can deliver others from.

0:09:52.160,0:09:57.120
I grew up very roughly – in a criminal lifestyle and drug culture.

0:09:57.120,0:10:01.500
At the age of 18, I went to prison for murder.

0:10:01.500,0:10:06.580
I spent the past 23 years incarcerated for the charge of murder.

0:10:06.580,0:10:15.580
It was while incarcerated that I encountered some of the outreach ministries.

0:10:15.580,0:10:19.820
That’s how I became acquainted with the Lighthouse Recovery Center.

0:10:19.820,0:10:25.680
There are numbers of secular recovery places that deal with addiction and compulsion

0:10:25.680,0:10:32.860
but they are missing that spiritual component – that God-shaped hole.

0:10:32.860,0:10:35.380
This is that wholeness;

0:10:35.380,0:10:41.460
this is what is going to bring us back to that balance.

0:10:41.460,0:10:49.260
What would lead a person to feel like they have to defend themselves or commit murder?

0:10:49.260,0:10:57.680
I know this is a very hard question, but what would you say is the root of a problem like that?

0:10:57.680,0:11:02.720
There may be someone out there that has anger or outburst.

0:11:02.720,0:11:05.400
What would you say to them?

0:11:05.400,0:11:08.580
Because you’ve been through it and now you have come out of it

0:11:08.580,0:11:10.380
so you can help lead someone out.

0:11:10.380,0:11:15.560
I know it is a hard question but it is so real.

0:11:15.560,0:11:18.540
As a youth, I saw it in myself.

0:11:18.540,0:11:22.740
Reflecting back, I see that there are so many today that lack that soundness,

0:11:22.740,0:11:28.880
that appropriate fathering in an active sense.

0:11:28.880,0:11:37.440
They are really being fed, nurtured and reared as men in that setting.

0:11:37.440,0:11:39.940
The spiritual component is lacking.

0:11:39.940,0:11:48.660
I would say that this is where things like Christian fathering programmes, parenting programmes

0:11:48.660,0:11:56.580
and being ‘churched’ in a verb, in an action sense, being poured into and invested in -

0:11:56.580,0:12:01.840
those inadequacies – I felt and I see it in so many others, especially in our youth.

0:12:01.840,0:12:04.760
Now you were saying that when it comes to youth,

0:12:04.760,0:12:07.780
you see a lot of them trying to manoeuvre through life

0:12:07.780,0:12:14.520
and trying to make it on their own the best way they know how.

0:12:14.520,0:12:18.660
Emmanuel TV Talks To Recovering Addicts At The Lighthouse Recovery Center

0:12:18.660,0:12:21.460
Getting back to the God-shaped hole in their heart,

0:12:21.460,0:12:31.760
they are trying to take so many things from the secular world, violence and the drug culture.

0:12:31.760,0:12:33.880
It is a square peg in a round hole.

0:12:33.880,0:12:36.300
It’s not fitting; it’s not working.

0:12:36.300,0:12:43.920
We have responses like the incarceration rates, rates of addiction, suicide

0:12:43.920,0:12:50.440
and recidivism rates for people that are returning to incarceration and staying in that cycle.

0:12:50.440,0:12:54.940
This is the answer – things that are Christ-centered:

0:12:54.940,0:13:02.220
recovery from addictions; training, discipling and really fathering

0:13:02.220,0:13:11.440
from ultimate Fathering down into men, sons, women and daughters.

0:13:11.440,0:13:13.260
This is the solution.

0:13:13.260,0:13:16.720
In addition to drug addiction and alcoholism was hatred.

0:13:16.720,0:13:23.080
I was a member in a capacity of leadership for a number of years,

0:13:23.080,0:13:27.360
in the Indiana Department of Corrections with the Aryan (White) Brotherhood.

0:13:27.360,0:13:30.520
I was delivered from that in addition to addiction.

0:13:30.520,0:13:39.440
It is sin and it’s a sin that you spread and contaminate others with.

0:13:39.440,0:13:42.060
To be delivered from that, to have that lifted off,

0:13:42.060,0:13:45.500
for that weight to be gone and be replaced with love -

0:13:45.500,0:13:52.880
that stony-hard heart covered in swastikas and all this muck and mire -

0:13:52.880,0:13:56.280
to be brought up out of that and be given a heart of flesh,

to come to know God as your Father and to have an intimate relationship

0:14:00.540,0:14:07.800
as a joint heir with Christ and His Kingdom is powerful.

0:14:07.800,0:14:10.140
This is more than just delivery from drugs.

0:14:10.140,0:14:12.760
This is deliverance; this is freedom.

0:14:12.760,0:14:18.860
This is what true power in love looks like in the flesh.

0:14:18.860,0:14:23.100
The Lighthouse Recovery Center is a place where great things have been going on.

0:14:23.100,0:14:26.020
We have a very special brother here who we partnered with.

0:14:26.020,0:14:31.240
We hosted a Back-To School Block Party and give-away.

0:14:31.240,0:14:35.080
Josh, tell us some of the things that we gave away at the block party.

0:14:35.080,0:14:43.460
Shoes, backpacks, food and T-shirts.

0:14:43.460,0:14:46.200
You allowed me to be a blessing and hand out to these children.

0:14:46.200,0:14:51.580
I had some kids crying because they have never received designer shoes in their life.

0:14:51.580,0:14:55.220
I was able to donate them and kids loved them.

0:14:55.220,0:14:57.940
Their response was great!

0:14:57.940,0:15:03.100
We all know how important those items are, especially to young children coming up in school.

0:15:03.100,0:15:06.080
I mean, the peer pressure and everything.

0:15:06.080,0:15:13.260
I went to a big city school and I’ve seen kids get their stuff taken from them.

0:15:13.260,0:15:18.260
Seeing these kids appreciate it like that – it is a gift from God.

0:15:18.260,0:15:25.780
Thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to feel that kind of blessing.

0:15:25.780,0:15:28.220
We would like to thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:15:28.220,0:15:33.120
and the Emmanuel TV Partners because you allow us to continue to help.

0:15:33.120,0:15:41.460
Here is our donation of $3,500 towards this ministry.

0:15:41.460,0:15:45.280
That is why it is so important for you to continue to give so that we can continue to help

0:15:45.280,0:15:49.240
The Lighthouse Recovery Center because they are reaching people and changing lives.

0:15:49.240,0:15:52.880
Our slogan is changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.

0:15:52.880,0:15:55.960
We can do these types of things together.

0:15:55.960,0:15:58.680
Just tell us how many men are here.

0:15:58.680,0:16:02.180
Between our two facilities, we have about 87 men.

0:16:02.180,0:16:07.160
We have about 40-45 women at the women’s facility.

0:16:07.160,0:16:10.520
We have transitional housing which I do not have those exact numbers for.

0:16:10.520,0:16:14.740
Those are for graduates as they leave the programme, to help them stay plugged in

0:16:14.740,0:16:20.080
because people are a lot more successful if they stay plugged into the ministry once they graduate.

0:16:20.080,0:16:23.860
We are trying to expand that and get more transitional housing for them

0:16:23.860,0:16:27.860
because right now, we don’t have enough for the amount of people we have.

0:16:27.860,0:16:30.180
We are trying to expand that; we are trying to grow

0:16:30.180,0:16:39.980
and with the way Emmanuel TV is helping us, we are going to keep going in the right direction.

0:16:39.980,0:16:46.740
Remember, we are changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
