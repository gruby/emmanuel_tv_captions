0:00:00.000,0:00:09.060
We are about to offer a mass prayer.

0:00:09.060,0:00:18.820
Mass prayer we are about to offer is like "each hand will be on one's side".

0:00:18.820,0:00:24.920
You will receive a hand while the prayer will be going on.

0:00:24.920,0:00:30.380
Not only people here but viewers at their homes, all over the world.

0:00:30.380,0:00:36.960
You have the presence of a "touch" on you.

0:00:36.960,0:00:48.480
What is about to happen now... after that you are stamped and sealed.

0:00:48.480,0:00:49.940
(Amen.)

0:00:49.940,0:00:53.480
I don't want you to miss it.

0:00:53.480,0:01:01.500
I have held many revivals all over the world.

0:01:01.500,0:01:17.320
I witnessed the Spirit of Father descend but not remain on everyone.

0:01:17.320,0:01:20.000
Not that the Spirit will not come down - no.

0:01:20.000,0:01:21.340
Who is calling that Spirit?

0:01:21.340,0:01:24.500
His servant.

0:01:24.500,0:01:29.040
When you see this revival, you will know it is a revival.

0:01:29.040,0:01:31.840
People of all colours.

0:01:31.840,0:01:38.400
Not just "one-sided people": white or black or... no.

0:01:38.400,0:01:46.980
People of all colours, accepting themselves, worshipping together - that is revival.

0:01:46.980,0:01:53.620
Just because I am from this country, I should not go to that country and call my people,

0:01:53.620,0:01:55.480
to join me for the revival.

0:01:55.480,0:02:03.660
This is revival I held - several of them all over the world.

0:02:03.660,0:02:19.840
I witnessed the Spirit of God descend but not remain on some people.

0:02:19.840,0:02:25.640
It remained on some.

0:02:25.640,0:02:38.240
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:02:38.240,0:02:42.420
You can check yourself if you have this kind of a character.

0:02:42.420,0:02:45.600
You see people falling down...

0:02:45.600,0:02:48.440
You see people vomiting...

0:02:48.440,0:02:54.400
You may have a similar situation but you will be looking until the whole thing is finished.

0:02:54.400,0:02:58.560
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:02:58.560,0:02:59.600
Tell your neighbour.

0:02:59.600,0:03:01.940
(He does not remain when He is grieved.)

0:03:01.940,0:03:18.780
I mean, the Spirit of Father, God, our Lord Jesus – He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:03:18.780,0:03:21.620
He will come down.

0:03:21.620,0:03:27.340
Let the power of the Lord come down.

0:03:27.340,0:03:29.520
The voice is gone.

0:03:29.520,0:03:31.760
To where?
To Heaven.

0:03:31.760,0:03:37.140
The Heaven will be checking whose voice is this.

0:03:37.140,0:03:40.320
Oh yes - this is our servant.

0:03:40.320,0:03:41.880
OK, let's go.

0:03:41.880,0:03:45.240
They follow the voice again, down.

0:03:45.240,0:03:48.020
Atmosphere changes.

0:03:48.020,0:03:54.740
Heaven will be looking for people that are ready for Him.

0:03:54.740,0:04:01.220
He does not remain in people when He is grieved.

0:04:01.220,0:04:03.280
You have to take note of this.

0:04:03.280,0:04:07.080
Your pastor is calling the congregation for prayer - you should be ready.

0:04:07.080,0:04:13.700
If he successfully called the Holy Ghost, he can not detain Him.

0:04:13.700,0:04:20.280
He can only call and the Holy Ghost will go and look at those who are really ready for Him.

0:04:20.280,0:04:23.980
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:04:23.980,0:04:37.260
We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride and we express our pride in different, various ways.

0:04:37.260,0:04:42.760
Everybody knows that when the man is very proud he looks like this.

0:04:42.760,0:04:44.960
You say:
- That man is proud.

0:04:44.960,0:04:46.740
- Where?
- The one coming up.

0:04:46.740,0:04:52.060
You will see a man like this.

0:04:52.060,0:04:57.540
That man is very proud - he will look like this.

0:04:57.540,0:04:58.460
Is it not true?

0:04:58.460,0:05:06.920
You see it as a pride but you don't know that there are different ways we can express our pride.

0:05:06.920,0:05:08.260
It is not the only way.

0:05:08.260,0:05:10.940
There are different ways we can express it.

0:05:10.940,0:05:13.600
Any moment from now you will see what will be happening.

0:05:13.600,0:05:20.060
You will hear some people laughing at others, "Oh my God, look at this person, who fell back".

0:05:20.060,0:05:23.440
But he himself did not fall.

0:05:23.440,0:05:31.620
If you don't fall and somebody does, why do you comment about this person who fell?

0:05:31.620,0:05:37.820
It is not a joke.

0:05:37.820,0:05:40.060
This is a church of God.

0:05:40.060,0:05:45.160
Get yourself ready.

0:05:45.160,0:05:48.760
Let the Spirit of Father remain in you.

0:05:48.760,0:05:58.720
He wants to be Himself in you; He does not want you to instruct Him.

0:05:58.720,0:06:04.340
He wants to be Himself in you.

0:06:04.340,0:06:05.700
Tell your neighbour.

0:06:05.700,0:06:08.540
(He wants to be Himself in you.)

0:06:08.540,0:06:09.380
Again.

0:06:09.380,0:06:11.760
(He wants to be Himself in you.)

0:06:11.760,0:06:12.720
Again.

0:06:12.720,0:06:14.980
(He wants to be Himself in you.)

0:06:14.980,0:06:21.060
He wants to be Himself in you.

0:06:21.060,0:06:33.440
Though He is using your shape, organs, body, yet, He wants to be Himself.

0:06:33.440,0:06:35.260
What are your challenges?

0:06:35.260,0:06:38.520
What are the issues of grieve?

0:06:38.520,0:06:46.280
When I hold a grudge against you, I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:06:46.280,0:06:47.460
Tell your neighbour.

0:06:47.460,0:06:51.740
(When I hold a grudge against you, I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.)

0:06:51.740,0:06:52.980
Again.

0:06:52.980,0:06:56.340
(When I hold a grudge against you, I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.)

0:06:56.340,0:07:06.820
Whether you are right or wrong, for any reason, as a Christian - once I hold a grudge against you,

0:07:06.820,0:07:12.080
I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:07:12.080,0:07:15.380
Are you holding a grudge?

0:07:15.380,0:07:16.940
Pain of the past?

0:07:16.940,0:07:24.100
Feel free now; just say in your heart and mean it, "I forgive that man. I forgive that woman."

0:07:24.100,0:07:25.800
Begin to bless your people.

0:07:25.800,0:07:28.400
Bless them.

0:07:28.400,0:07:33.180
It is over my way - no, I am sorry, God.

0:07:33.180,0:07:39.220
Lord, forgive me as I forgive those who have sinned against me.

0:07:39.220,0:07:44.620
So, begin now, before we call Heaven.

0:07:44.620,0:07:53.620
When Heaven comes down, the Spirit of Father, He does not remain in a man who holds a grudge.

0:07:53.620,0:07:56.920
That is why you need to clear yourself now.

0:07:56.920,0:08:03.120
The blind man who couldn't see, will begin to say, "I can see!"

0:08:03.120,0:08:13.460
You will say, "Everything is happening around me. Is it arranged? Over there. Vomit, blood, worms, insects.

0:08:13.460,0:08:19.460
What's wrong? This does not work for me."

0:08:19.460,0:08:31.340
When Heaven – that is, the Spirit of Father – comes, He does not work in a man who holds a grudge.

0:08:31.340,0:08:36.280
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:08:36.280,0:08:41.020
We can only grieve Him when we hold a grudge against our brother.

0:08:41.020,0:08:45.180
Everyone holds grudges.

0:08:45.180,0:08:51.800
There is no single person here than can stand and say, "No, I'm free from this".

0:08:51.800,0:08:57.080
People will tell you they had been wounded, unjustly treated:

0:08:57.080,0:09:01.300
"I am innocent but this is what they have done to me. I am not happy."

0:09:01.300,0:09:06.880
You are holding a grudge; not on anyone else but on yourself.

0:09:06.880,0:09:12.520
Your spirit can never be free when you are not happy.

0:09:12.520,0:09:17.060
You have seen God as reliable.

0:09:17.060,0:09:21.400
When you know God is reliable, what happens next?

0:09:21.400,0:09:26.100
You begin to trust in Him!

0:09:26.100,0:09:28.620
That is the meaning of ‘reliable’.

0:09:28.620,0:09:39.400
The moment you realise He is reliable, you begin to trust in Him and depend on Him.

0:09:39.400,0:09:45.020
Rise up for prayer.

0:09:45.020,0:09:55.680
We are here to stand against anything that is not of God.

0:09:55.680,0:10:05.100
Those things are the cause of the crisis and challenges you are having today.

0:10:05.100,0:10:11.360
Therefore, let God Himself, Jesus, give us a Word to say.

0:10:11.360,0:10:15.780
If I allow you to begin to pray...

0:10:15.780,0:10:18.200
There are a lot of things you want to pray for.

0:10:18.200,0:10:20.080
They are too many.

0:10:20.080,0:10:23.900
You say, "I rebuke this one"...

0:10:23.900,0:10:26.280
There are a lot of things you want to rebuke.

0:10:26.280,0:10:29.560
We don’t know how to pray; the Holy Spirit gives us a Word.

0:10:29.560,0:10:35.100
When He gives us the Word in prayer, it becomes prayer language.

0:10:35.100,0:10:36.180
Prayer what?

0:10:36.180,0:10:37.740
(Language.)

0:10:37.740,0:10:41.920
You don't know prayer has its own language.

0:10:41.920,0:10:45.800
Holy Spirit, give me a Word; I don't know how to pray - the Holy Spirit gives me.

0:10:45.800,0:10:49.400
There is a barrier between you and God.

0:10:49.400,0:11:01.380
There is a wall, that does not allow you to even see, hear or feel the realm, the presence of God.

0:11:01.380,0:11:03.960
Something is between you and God.

0:11:03.960,0:11:05.820
That is a barrier.

0:11:05.820,0:11:17.180
It could be holding grudges, trials, an unforgiving spirit or pain in the past.

0:11:17.180,0:11:20.240
You refuse to let it go.

0:11:20.240,0:11:26.700
If you don’t let yesterday go, you can’t enjoy today.

0:11:26.700,0:11:29.740
That is what you have in the school - the carry-over.

0:11:29.740,0:11:32.860
That language is not good - carry-over.

0:11:32.860,0:11:40.200
Many of us are full of yesterday and we want to enjoy today – it’s not possible.

0:11:40.200,0:11:41.120
Tell your neighbour.

0:11:41.120,0:11:50.340
You are full of yesterday and we want to enjoy today – it’s not possible.

0:11:50.340,0:11:53.940
To be full of yesterday it to think about your past.

0:11:53.940,0:11:59.620
If what you are full of are good things of yesterday, you can enjoy today.

0:11:59.620,0:12:04.080
But they are not good things; the bad of it is what you are thinking about.

0:12:04.080,0:12:07.460
It will not allow you to enjoy today.

0:12:07.460,0:12:13.060
Take just good of yesterday and be full of that good.

0:12:13.060,0:12:18.740
You want to enjoy today but you remember the bad, how you were disappointed, how your job wasn't going well.

0:12:18.740,0:12:22.800
These are the problems you are facing.

0:12:22.800,0:12:24.060
You can release yourself.

0:12:24.060,0:12:31.080
These are the causes of the barrier.

0:12:31.080,0:12:32.900
OK.

0:12:32.900,0:12:35.660
You know, Jesus loves you.

0:12:35.660,0:12:36.580
I can't hear you.

0:12:36.580,0:12:37.720
(Amen.)

0:12:37.720,0:12:38.920
I can't hear you.

0:12:38.920,0:12:40.160
(Amen.)

0:12:40.160,0:12:44.800
If your confess that Jesus loves you, I want to hear you clear.

0:12:44.800,0:12:50.320
(Jesus loves me.)

0:12:50.320,0:12:53.180
Yes, I'm happy to hear that.

0:12:53.180,0:13:12.380
Right now, open your lips and begin to rebuke every satanic covenant of attitude and character!

0:13:12.380,0:13:14.280
Begin to rebuke it.

The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:15:10.020,0:15:11.960
I caused her pain.

0:15:11.960,0:15:13.220
What else?

0:15:13.220,0:15:16.460
I want her to be crying.

0:15:16.460,0:15:18.400
Just look at her.

0:15:18.400,0:15:21.440
She thinks she can deliver the family.

0:15:21.440,0:15:24.640
She thinks she can turn things around.

0:15:32.400,0:15:37.040
In the morning she is crying.

0:15:37.040,0:15:40.260
She wants to sing for the Lord - I said, "No".

0:15:40.260,0:15:45.000
Spirit of anger.

0:15:45.000,0:15:50.800
I have destroyed her.

0:15:50.800,0:15:53.720
Career failure.

0:15:53.720,0:15:56.580
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:15:56.580,0:16:00.160
(Amen.)

0:16:00.160,0:16:18.680
Whatever disease or sickness, be it infirmity, wherever it is located -

0:16:18.680,0:16:24.480
in the name of Jesus, begin to rebuke them!

0:16:24.480,0:16:31.600
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:16:31.600,0:16:40.120
I want to destroy her.

0:16:40.120,0:16:46.700
I want to kill her.

0:16:46.700,0:16:49.440
Her marriage is scattered.

0:16:49.440,0:17:01.380
Viewers all over the world, wherever disease, sickness or infirmity is located, Jesus is Lord.

0:17:01.380,0:17:12.820
I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:12.820,0:17:22.780
Viewers at home, wherever that pain or infirmity is located in your body -

0:17:22.780,0:17:34.120
be it in your kidney, liver, blood or fluids – go, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:34.120,0:17:37.920
(Amen.)

0:17:37.920,0:17:42.100
You must leave; you have to leave.

0:17:42.100,0:17:45.440
I say, leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:45.440,0:17:49.420
Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:49.420,0:17:51.300
You must leave.

0:17:51.300,0:17:54.140
I say, you must leave.

0:17:54.140,0:17:56.720
Leave my people!

0:17:56.720,0:18:03.920
I say, you pain, leave my people!

0:18:03.920,0:18:12.260
The part of your body that is giving you pain or discomfort -

0:18:12.260,0:18:20.340
whatever sickness or disease – I say to that disease, leave my people!

0:18:20.340,0:18:22.720
(Amen.)

0:18:22.720,0:18:30.280
That is not your place; it’s a wrong place for you.

0:18:30.280,0:18:33.140
Begin to relocate right now.

0:18:33.140,0:18:39.620
Leave my people!

0:18:39.620,0:18:55.860
In your blood, fluids, kidney, live or flesh – you must go!

0:18:55.860,0:18:57.520
(Amen.)

This girl is going to suffer all her life.

0:22:17.380,0:22:22.760
Her career - she doesn't do anything.

0:22:22.760,0:22:28.820
Her family - she is just working for them.

0:22:28.820,0:22:32.440
I entered her when she lost her parents.

0:22:32.440,0:22:38.480
I was having a pain here - all this side.

0:22:38.480,0:22:44.300
Now, after vomiting, after the prayer of the Prophet, I am feeling OK, I can do this.

0:22:44.300,0:22:48.540
Thank You, Jesus for healing me.

My name is Ms. Inkeshi Agbe (?)

0:24:05.140,0:24:09.860
For last six years I had ceased menstruation.

0:24:09.860,0:24:16.900
As the man of God, senior Prophet T.B. Joshua was rendering prayer, I felt a sensation in my stomach.

0:24:16.900,0:24:19.200
I rushed to the restroom.

0:24:19.200,0:24:22.200
I found out that my period has started rushing out now.

0:24:31.760,0:24:38.940
The lady rushes to the restroom to check herself and confirm the instant healing.

0:24:38.940,0:24:47.560
To the glory of God, the bloodied stains on the tissue paper prove that indeed her ceased menstruation

0:24:47.560,0:24:50.180
has been gloriously restored.

0:24:50.180,0:24:57.260
I just entered the restroom and discovered that the menstruation is coming out very well.

0:24:57.260,0:25:02.340
This problem of ceased menstruation has taken me to different hospitals.

0:25:02.340,0:25:09.560
Even the doctors from the hospital told me that there was no hope to see a period.

0:25:09.560,0:25:13.840
Watch your screen.

0:25:13.840,0:25:23.980
Jesus knows those areas in your health that are giving you discomfort.

0:25:23.980,0:25:26.020
He knows.

0:25:26.020,0:25:31.160
He sent me now to speak a Word to release you.

0:25:31.160,0:25:33.720
