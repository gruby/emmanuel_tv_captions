GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING

0:00:03.340,0:00:10.100
On 26th July 2009, during a Sunday live service at The SCOAN,

0:00:10.100,0:00:14.200
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a call to pray for the nation Iran.

0:00:14.200,0:00:16.000
These were his words.

0:00:16.000,0:00:19.840
In Jesus' name.

0:00:19.840,0:00:25.760
Pray for the nation Iran.

0:00:25.760,0:00:30.260
Please, open your lips and pray for the nation.

0:00:30.260,0:00:33.800
Prayer.

0:00:33.800,0:00:36.540
In Jesus' name we pray.

0:00:36.540,0:00:41.140
God's intervention.

0:00:41.140,0:00:44.840
On Sunday 6th November 2011,

0:00:44.840,0:00:50.280
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave another prophetic message about the nation Iran.

0:00:50.280,0:00:55.960
He called for peace between the nations, specifically Iran and Israel.

0:00:55.960,0:01:00.240
He then called on the congregation and viewers to pray for God's intervention.

0:01:00.240,0:01:03.120
We should pray for a nation to nation.

0:01:03.120,0:01:12.300
There was a prophecy I gave - pray for a country, Iran, and other super nations

0:01:12.300,0:01:14.900
that crisis---

0:01:14.900,0:01:16.980
I said it three years ago.

0:01:16.980,0:01:19.560
It is very close now.

0:01:19.560,0:01:21.740
I want everyone to be on their knees.

0:01:21.740,0:01:24.480
We don't want crisis again; we don't want war again.

0:01:24.480,0:01:26.040
We don't want an attack again.

0:01:26.040,0:01:31.480
Whatever God will do to put an end to crises from nation to nation---

0:01:31.480,0:01:35.420
I'm seeing crisis between these countries.

0:01:35.420,0:01:37.160
Be on your knees and pray.

0:01:37.160,0:01:39.220
Ask God - we need peace.

0:01:39.220,0:01:41.400
God's intervention.

0:01:41.400,0:01:44.340
It's close now - very, very close.

0:01:44.340,0:01:48.500
I'm seeing an attack. I'm seeing a fight between nation to nation.

0:01:48.500,0:01:52.820
Three years ago, I mentioned particularly Iran, that they should pray.

0:01:52.820,0:01:55.460
Pray for God's intervention.

0:01:55.460,0:01:59.920
God should settle every difference.

0:01:59.920,0:02:05.080
Ask God for intervention for that nation and other nations.

0:02:05.080,0:02:07.760
We don't want it.

0:02:07.760,0:02:10.780
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:02:10.780,0:02:16.160
Because the war is not going to bring solution to the whole world,

0:02:16.160,0:02:19.240
rather, crisis.

0:02:19.240,0:02:21.100
We want God's intervention.

0:02:21.100,0:02:33.460
God's intervention

0:02:33.460,0:02:37.240
In the whole world

0:02:37.240,0:02:44.280
God's intervention

0:02:44.280,0:02:47.980
We need God's intervention

0:02:47.980,0:02:51.240
In the whole world

0:02:51.240,0:03:01.000
God's intervention

0:03:01.000,0:03:04.340
In the whole world

0:03:04.340,0:03:10.680
God's intervention

0:03:10.680,0:03:13.880
We need God's intervention

0:03:13.880,0:03:17.420
In the whole world

0:03:17.420,0:03:19.680
Father, we thank You.

0:03:19.680,0:03:24.800
We want God's intervention in whatever differences between nation to nation.

0:03:24.800,0:03:27.680
We pray for the nation, Iran.

0:03:27.680,0:03:30.760
We pray for the nation, Israel.

0:03:30.760,0:03:34.260
God's intervention in whatever differences.

0:03:34.260,0:03:37.960
Father, with You, all things are possible.

0:03:37.960,0:03:42.060
We know, to Your power, everything is possible.

0:03:42.060,0:03:43.880
Father, we thank You.

0:03:43.880,0:03:45.700
Pray for God's intervention.

0:03:45.700,0:03:48.700
We know our God is able.

0:03:48.700,0:03:51.080
He is able

0:03:51.080,0:03:56.960
More than able

0:03:56.960,0:04:01.220
To accomplish what concerns

0:04:01.220,0:04:06.040
Me today

0:04:06.040,0:04:09.660
He is able

0:04:09.660,0:04:15.440
More than able

0:04:15.440,0:04:17.720
And He can handle

0:04:17.720,0:04:24.480
Anything that comes my way

0:04:24.480,0:04:27.800
He is able

0:04:27.800,0:04:34.160
More than able

0:04:34.160,0:04:36.080
To do much more

0:04:36.080,0:04:42.100
Than I could ever dream

0:04:42.100,0:04:45.480
He is able

0:04:45.480,0:04:51.700
More than able

0:04:51.700,0:04:58.800
To make me what He wants me to be

0:04:58.800,0:05:05.640
On Sunday, February 5th 2012, Prophet T.B. Joshua referred to the prophetic message

0:05:05.640,0:05:08.720
he had been speaking about for the past three years

0:05:08.720,0:05:12.560
concerning tension between the nations of Iran and Israel.

0:05:12.560,0:05:15.640
He then illustrated what would occur between the nations

0:05:15.640,0:05:20.340
if the tension continued and gave a call to pray for the whole world.

0:05:20.340,0:05:25.060
Last year, I reminded you of what I said three years ago

0:05:25.060,0:05:29.140
to pray for the nation Iran.

0:05:29.140,0:05:36.580
And I also said that I'm seeing tension between Iran and Israel.

0:05:36.580,0:05:43.040
I then said it last year, that what I was talking about was very close -

0:05:43.040,0:05:46.740
the tension of, I want to fight; you want to fight.

0:05:46.740,0:05:50.000
It's close; any moment from now, you will hear it.

0:05:50.000,0:05:52.760
And we all went on our knees.

0:05:52.760,0:05:56.320
Because if that should happen, it would be very serious,

0:05:56.320,0:06:00.460
more than any other one you have ever witnessed.

0:06:00.460,0:06:03.760
We went on our knees and we begged God.

0:06:03.760,0:06:14.240
But the prayer we offered that day, I know it will not go in vain.

0:06:14.240,0:06:17.120
Now, we'll follow the prayer.

0:06:17.120,0:06:22.600
They will continue to discuss, coming to a kind of compromise,

0:06:22.600,0:06:24.600
agreement and so on and so forth.

0:06:24.600,0:06:29.340
This will continue to drag until the full understanding comes.

0:06:29.340,0:06:36.220
But we should not stop praying because a break in prayer -

0:06:36.220,0:06:38.040
war will start.

0:06:38.040,0:06:40.880
Let us pray.

0:06:40.880,0:06:45.120
This one will be different from others.

0:06:45.120,0:06:48.840
This is why we don't want a fight.

0:06:48.840,0:06:55.760
If this kind of fight starts, every other one you have read about is an atom.

0:06:55.760,0:07:00.740
This one will be an element.

0:07:00.740,0:07:05.860
You know atom to element - how big the size is.

0:07:05.860,0:07:07.280
So that is it.

0:07:07.280,0:07:10.280
This one is not an issue of fighting a country to country

0:07:10.280,0:07:14.240
but the whole world should begin to pray that this should not happen;

0:07:14.240,0:07:19.240
they should come to an understanding and dialogue.

0:07:19.240,0:07:27.140
Because if this thing happens, many countries will join in support of others.

0:07:27.140,0:07:30.000
Trouble has come.

0:07:30.000,0:07:33.320
And it will not be an issue of---

0:07:33.320,0:07:36.000
Come on.

0:07:36.000,0:07:38.680
I'm talking to you; you are talking to me.

0:07:38.680,0:07:40.580
It's between me and you.

0:07:40.580,0:07:46.640
I will not agree! I will not!

0:07:46.640,0:07:48.940
God should stop the two of us.

0:07:48.940,0:07:50.640
If not---

0:07:50.640,0:07:52.300
Come.

0:07:52.300,0:07:56.600
You want to support this man to fight me.

0:07:56.600,0:07:59.800
You want to support me.

0:07:59.800,0:08:01.860
You want to support this man.

0:08:01.860,0:08:06.240
Come. You want to support this man.

0:08:06.240,0:08:09.460
You want to support me.

0:08:09.460,0:08:10.680
What is coming?

0:08:10.680,0:08:13.920
World War.

0:08:13.920,0:08:15.220
Sit down.

0:08:15.220,0:08:19.740
PROPHECY FOR ISRAEL AND IRAN | Prophet TB Joshua

0:08:19.740,0:08:21.960
So, I'm talking to you in parables.

0:08:21.960,0:08:24.560
This is the only way I can say it.

0:08:24.560,0:08:29.120
So, this is why I said, it's not like others.

0:08:29.120,0:08:33.560
The whole scenario, it's not like others.

0:08:33.560,0:08:38.440
So please, we should be very careful all over the world.

0:08:38.440,0:08:40.940
It's not like others.

0:08:40.940,0:08:48.520
Others may just go; but this one, it will spread.

0:08:48.520,0:08:53.380
So please, dialogue, settlement.

0:08:53.380,0:08:54.480
Thank you.

0:08:54.480,0:09:01.500
Rise up for this moment.

0:09:01.500,0:09:14.220
I want us to bow down our heads and pray to God for peace all over the world.

0:09:14.220,0:09:21.960
Pray that the world should be ready to shift ground.

0:09:21.960,0:09:24.740
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:09:24.740,0:09:26.120
Amen.

0:09:26.120,0:09:28.580
We pray that they should shift ground.

0:09:28.580,0:09:31.460
Shift ground means, "Leave the place".

0:09:31.460,0:09:32.920
"I said I will not leave."

0:09:32.920,0:09:38.860
"Well okay, I will leave this place."

0:09:38.860,0:09:48.640
Compromise means to overlook certain things to give chance for peace.

0:09:48.640,0:09:54.460
Every Monday from now, I want you to be on your knees in your home

0:09:54.460,0:09:57.000
and begin to pray for the whole world.
