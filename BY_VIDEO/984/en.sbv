0:00:00.000,0:00:12.060
I will take this my message from the Book of John 15, verse 11.

0:00:12.060,0:00:15.440
John 15, verse 11.

0:00:15.440,0:00:19.060
Are you there?

0:00:19.060,0:00:33.040
“I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.”

0:00:33.040,0:00:37.220
It means without God’s joy, we don’t have joy.

0:00:37.220,0:00:42.180
So, what is not done right is not done at all.

0:00:42.180,0:00:46.220
When something is not complete, it is nothing.

0:00:46.220,0:00:47.700
It is not right.

0:00:47.700,0:00:50.960
The joy of God makes our joy what?

0:00:50.960,0:00:52.720
(Complete.)

0:00:52.720,0:00:55.460
... makes our joy complete.

0:00:55.460,0:00:57.340
This is what the Bible says here.

0:00:57.340,0:01:06.740
“I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.”

0:01:06.740,0:01:09.400
(Amen.)

0:01:09.400,0:01:11.900
Think about that.

0:01:11.900,0:01:17.440
So, it means without God’s joy, we have no joy.

0:01:17.440,0:01:23.080
What is not done well is not done at all.

0:01:23.080,0:01:29.340
Don't forget the Book of John 16:33.

0:01:29.340,0:01:37.700
“These things I speak to you, in Me, you may have peace.”

0:01:37.700,0:01:38.520
(Amen.)

0:01:38.520,0:01:47.860
And this John 15:11 - it is telling us that without God's joy, we have no joy.

0:01:47.860,0:01:52.340
This means peace is synonymous to joy.

0:01:52.340,0:01:59.600
Peace is synonymous - that is, another word for peace is joy.

0:01:59.600,0:02:03.160
It is a fruit of faith – joy!

0:02:03.160,0:02:05.540
It is a fruit of what?

0:02:05.540,0:02:10.460
It is a fruit - like a mango on a tree.

0:02:10.460,0:02:15.580
You have a fruit on the top - the tree is faith.

0:02:15.580,0:02:24.300
Mango on top of... - joy, peace, love.

0:02:24.300,0:02:28.500
It is a fruit of faith.

0:02:28.500,0:02:40.200
It is a fruit that comes from the recreated spirit – love, peace, joy.

0:02:40.200,0:02:45.360
It means, without faith, no joy.

0:02:45.360,0:02:49.280
Faith is the tree that carries that.

0:02:49.280,0:02:59.760
This is why joy is something that only believers have; no other people.

0:02:59.760,0:03:03.900
If you are not a believer, you are without joy.

0:03:03.900,0:03:08.740
Joy is something that only believers have.

0:03:08.740,0:03:14.840
Tell your neighbour: "If you are not a believer, you have no joy."

0:03:14.840,0:03:19.020
If you are not a believer, you have no joy.

0:03:19.020,0:03:22.780
It’s not something you can manufacture or create by yourself.

0:03:22.780,0:03:25.640
You think, "I need joy, I need joy."

0:03:25.640,0:03:31.320
Money - millions of dollars cannot give you that joy.

0:03:31.320,0:03:41.820
The world may have happiness – they find that in their environment and in their surroundings.

0:03:41.820,0:03:46.640
The world, those who are not believers - they may have happiness.

0:03:46.640,0:03:50.460
Happiness, when they give you a million dollars you say, "Oh! Happiness has come!"

0:03:50.460,0:03:55.280
You begin to say, "Hey!" But not joy!

0:03:55.280,0:03:57.720
One day you receive a phone call from the president,

0:03:57.720,0:04:00.300
"Hey! They want to see you in the White House!" or whatever.

0:04:00.300,0:04:05.460
"Oh!" - that is happiness; it is not joy.

0:04:05.460,0:04:14.980
The world may have happiness – they find that in their environment and in their surroundings.

0:04:14.980,0:04:18.460
That is the world.

0:04:18.460,0:04:26.100
But joy is something only believers have.

0:04:26.100,0:04:27.980
Are you a believer?

0:04:27.980,0:04:29.120
I can't hear you.

0:04:29.120,0:04:31.340
(Yes!)

0:04:31.340,0:04:32.400
Are you a believer?

0:04:32.400,0:04:33.840
(Yes.)

0:04:33.840,0:04:36.020
You understand what I am saying.

0:04:36.020,0:04:40.100
That shows that joy is our conquering power.

0:04:40.100,0:04:42.080
Let someone say, “conquering power”.

0:04:42.080,0:04:43.200
(Conquering power.)

0:04:43.200,0:04:45.940
If you don’t have joy, no power - conquering power

0:04:45.940,0:04:49.660
Power to overcome sickness is joy.

0:04:49.660,0:04:52.100
Power to overcome hardship is joy.

0:04:52.100,0:04:54.990
Power to overcome isolation is joy.

0:04:54.990,0:04:57.880
Power to overcome affliction is joy.

0:04:57.880,0:05:00.480
If you don’t have joy, you cannot overcome this.

0:05:00.480,0:05:07.640
The Bible says, "All this will happen but cheer up, I have overcome."

0:05:07.640,0:05:10.740
(Amen.)

0:05:10.740,0:05:14.880
Conquering power.

0:05:14.880,0:05:28.380
Take note; whenever our joy seeps out and leaves us barren and empty,

0:05:28.380,0:05:37.240
it proves that we are out of fellowship, out of contact with God.

0:05:37.240,0:05:42.600
Anytime you notice that there is no joy - out of God.

0:05:42.600,0:05:49.140
You cannot pray - even when you are praying, you are not there.

Whenever our joy seeps out,

0:06:02.620,0:06:10.920
it proves that we are out of fellowship, out of contact with God.

0:06:10.920,0:06:20.680
Whenever you find no joy - no fellowship, no joy - no contact with God.

0:06:20.680,0:06:25.240
I have joy - this is why you see me.

0:06:25.240,0:06:29.820
Say, "Joy is my conquering power".

0:06:29.820,0:06:34.000
Yes.

0:06:34.000,0:06:35.500
Conquering power.

0:06:35.500,0:06:38.400
When you have joy, you will overcome affliction.

0:06:38.400,0:06:43.020
You have affliction but you tell people, "With God all things are possible".

0:06:43.020,0:06:46.480
You will be laughing, you see people laughing and happy, whereas they have...

0:06:46.480,0:06:53.560
Look at Apostle Paul with a thorn in his flesh - go and read it in Corinthians.

0:06:53.560,0:07:04.740
The Bible did not tell us exactly the affliction he had, but we know it was an affliction from the pit of hell.

0:07:07.780,0:07:18.540
As a Christian, trials may test you; they cannot destroy or rob your joy.

0:07:18.540,0:07:24.900
When you are not a believer, trials will destroy you,

0:07:24.900,0:07:28.160
will overthrow you from your position,

0:07:28.160,0:07:30.440
will take you out of God.

0:07:30.440,0:07:33.640
It is trial and affliction that cause all this today.

0:07:33.640,0:07:38.280
Many of us want to reestablish our relationship with God.

0:07:38.280,0:07:45.920
You keep going out, out, going out, out, going out because of trouble.

0:07:45.920,0:07:50.860
When you have trouble, you begin to say, "Why do I have this trouble?".

0:07:50.860,0:07:57.260
And you don't know that satan uses this to rob you of your joy,

0:07:57.260,0:08:02.040
to rob you of your relationship.

0:08:02.040,0:08:16.240
Temptation, affliction, poverty, hardship may test you as a man of faith;

0:08:16.240,0:08:20.180
they cannot destroy you because of joy.

0:08:20.180,0:08:21.560
(Amen.)
