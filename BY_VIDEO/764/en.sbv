0:00:00.160,0:00:05.020
Good morning.

0:00:05.020,0:00:16.940
Someone asked me to greet you, "Happy Birthday!"

0:00:16.940,0:00:22.260
I was asking Him, "why do You ask me to greet people of God 'Happy Birthday'?"

0:00:22.260,0:00:33.140
He said, "Wednesday is Emmanuel TV's birthday".

0:00:33.140,0:00:39.100
Emmanuel TV will be 11 years old. Happy Birthday!

0:00:39.100,0:00:41.580
Hallelujah.

0:00:41.580,0:00:47.480
Viewers all over the world, Happy Birthday!

0:00:47.480,0:00:56.320
Your Emmanuel TV will be 11 years old.

0:00:56.320,0:00:58.380
Hallelujah

0:00:58.380,0:01:00.120
Wow

0:01:00.120,0:01:13.260
Jesus knows many of us here will repent because you are a true 'born-again'.

0:01:13.260,0:01:17.120
How do we know you are a true 'born-again'?

0:01:17.120,0:01:26.880
We know you are a true 'born-again' when each time you miss the mark, you run to God

0:01:26.880,0:01:30.180
because you are a true 'born-again'.

0:01:30.180,0:01:33.620
Is it not a joyful thing for you?

0:01:33.620,0:01:39.760
I can’t see your joy.

0:01:39.760,0:01:41.620
It is a prophesy.

0:01:41.620,0:01:44.380
This is a message from Heaven.

0:01:44.380,0:01:52.580
Jesus says He knows you will repent because you are a true 'born-again'.

0:01:52.580,0:01:53.600
Amen.

0:01:53.600,0:02:09.220
You know, when is a true 'born-again', you can only miss the mark; you cannot sin if your adoption is genuine.

0:02:09.220,0:02:15.560
If you are a true 'born-again', nothing can separate you from God.

0:02:15.560,0:02:23.480
You can only miss the mark; you cannot sin.

0:02:23.480,0:02:28.760
The wrong becomes sin when you refuse to repent.

0:02:28.760,0:02:32.980
When you refuse to repent it becomes a sin.

0:02:32.980,0:02:36.100
How do we know a true 'born-again'?

0:02:36.100,0:02:43.360
We know a true 'born-again' when each time he misses the mark, he runs to God.

0:02:43.360,0:02:46.320
I'm sorry.

0:02:46.320,0:02:47.820
It is over.

0:02:47.820,0:02:48.940
That is truly 'born-again' -

0:02:48.940,0:02:50.400
he is connected.

0:02:50.400,0:02:54.580
His position cannot be displaced; it's always there.

0:02:54.580,0:03:01.520
He can only leave the position for a while and come back.

0:03:01.520,0:03:03.840
Hallelujah

0:03:03.840,0:03:09.960
Talk on faith.

0:03:09.960,0:03:13.200
Let someone say, "talk on faith".

0:03:13.200,0:03:14.980
Yes.

0:03:14.980,0:03:22.460
We have many books to read.

0:03:22.460,0:03:33.580
I will take the book of Hebrews which seems to be very appropriate, close to what we are about to talk.

0:03:33.580,0:03:36.800
Hebrews 4.

0:03:36.800,0:03:42.520
I will take my reading from verse 1, and the proof test will be verse 3 there.

0:03:42.520,0:03:50.600
"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful

0:03:50.600,0:03:54.280
that none of you be found to have fallen short of it."

0:03:54.280,0:04:03.000
None of you be found fallen for short of glory, grace...

0:04:03.000,0:04:10.740
Hebrews 4:2, "For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did;

0:04:10.740,0:04:14.900
but the message they heard was of no value to them,

0:04:14.900,0:04:21.880
because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed."

0:04:21.880,0:04:30.720
Verse 3, "Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said."

0:04:30.720,0:04:34.280
Those who believed enter that rest.

0:04:34.280,0:04:50.740
It means faith and rest cannot be separated from one another.

0:04:50.740,0:05:07.920
Whenever our heart truly believes, it will always be at rest.

0:05:07.920,0:05:20.000
If our hearts are uneasy and restless, if we are afraid of this or that,

0:05:20.000,0:05:33.280
if we are struggling with all our effort to plan, resolve, plead or ask for help,

0:05:33.280,0:05:39.740
this shows that we have not yet believed.

0:05:39.740,0:05:46.160
When one truly believes, he is at rest.

0:05:46.160,0:05:52.440
When a person believes, he will no longer worry.

0:05:52.440,0:05:58.700
When you truly believe Jesus, you will no longer worry.

0:05:58.700,0:06:00.440
Take note of that.

0:06:00.440,0:06:04.120
Faith does not come by force.

0:06:04.120,0:06:09.620
Anything that comes by force is not faith.

0:06:09.620,0:06:15.800
Faith is something that comes spontaneously, naturally.

0:06:15.800,0:06:21.420
Something that comes spontaneously.

0:06:21.420,0:06:32.240
For example, if we see a man, a person, we know he is there.

0:06:32.240,0:06:37.900
We don’t need to struggle to believe.

0:06:37.900,0:06:41.140
That is faith.

0:06:41.140,0:06:49.680
Within a second, we believe spontaneously.

0:06:49.680,0:06:52.580
I am just giving you the picture of faith.

0:06:52.580,0:06:55.520
There are all kinds of faith.

0:06:55.520,0:07:02.420
Faith in faith, faith in ourselves, faith in "such of nature", faith in this...

0:07:02.420,0:07:04.100
I have faith in business...

0:07:04.100,0:07:07.140
We use the word "faith" in business.

0:07:07.140,0:07:15.060
I have faith in you, I have faith you will do the job, I know by faith, all kinds of faith.

0:07:15.060,0:07:18.760
That is not the faith in God.

0:07:18.760,0:07:25.820
If you have faith in God, you should not just believe in Him.

0:07:25.820,0:07:31.840
Today, we claim we believe but where is our faith?

0:07:31.840,0:07:38.900
Faith is practical.

0:07:38.900,0:07:49.100
What we do expresses what we believe.

0:07:49.100,0:07:51.200
It is purely practical.

0:07:51.200,0:07:57.080
The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.

0:07:57.080,0:08:03.040
Have faith in God; all things are possible.

0:08:03.040,0:08:05.420
Have faith in God.

0:08:05.420,0:08:15.560
The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.

0:08:15.560,0:08:28.700
We should not merely talk about faith; we should put it into practice.

0:08:28.700,0:08:30.800
Faith is a conviction.

0:08:30.800,0:08:33.100
It’s a demonstration.

0:08:33.100,0:08:36.860
Have faith in God.

0:08:36.860,0:08:43.320
Today, people don’t know how to believe and express their faith.

0:08:43.320,0:08:45.440
Many people say they believe;

0:08:45.440,0:08:46.500
I believe Jesus...

0:08:46.500,0:08:49.680
If you believe Jesus, where is your faith?

0:08:49.680,0:09:06.660
Not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord; we should know Him like children know their father.

0:09:06.660,0:09:07.700
Take note,

0:09:07.700,0:09:21.140
not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord; we should know Him like children know their father.

0:09:21.140,0:09:23.720
How do children know their father?

0:09:23.720,0:09:26.620
Good children depend on their father.

0:09:26.620,0:09:29.880
Good children know how much they love their father.

0:09:29.880,0:09:33.720
Good children know how much they need their father.

0:09:33.720,0:09:36.260
That are good children.

0:09:36.260,0:09:40.160
Faith can be applied.

0:09:40.160,0:09:42.780
This is an application.

0:09:42.780,0:09:47.460
You can say, "I believe" because you know you cannot show that belief.

0:09:47.460,0:09:50.920
We hide under that belief.

0:09:50.920,0:09:55.840
Faith can be applied.

0:09:55.840,0:10:09.800
We can apply all of God's blessings through faith and make them manifest in us.

0:10:09.800,0:10:14.500
Have faith in God.

0:10:14.500,0:10:17.340
The Bible is full of promises.

0:10:17.340,0:10:40.240
For every matter, there are promises that God will do for us as long as we have faith.

0:10:40.240,0:10:45.640
God will listen to us as long as we have faith.

0:10:45.640,0:10:51.260
One without faith is dead.

0:10:51.260,0:10:57.620
Faith without works is dead in the same way.

0:10:57.620,0:11:07.760
How many of us can stand to say, "I know God like children know their father"?

0:11:07.760,0:11:10.300
No.

0:11:10.300,0:11:14.500
You only know Him as a Sovereign Lord.

0:11:14.500,0:11:25.780
He owns the world, He is a father of invisible and visible, that's all.

0:11:25.780,0:11:30.760
The question – how should one have faith in God?

0:11:30.760,0:11:37.780
We have faith in God through the daily things around us.

0:11:37.780,0:11:43.280
In Jesus' name.

0:11:43.280,0:11:50.860
See me, I want to talk - "in Jesus' name", I want to raise my hand - "in Jesus' name", I want to greet

0:11:50.860,0:11:53.220
I will mention Jesus.

0:11:53.220,0:11:59.660
I want to cough - I call Jesus before I cough.

0:11:59.660,0:12:01.400
I want to dress up.

0:12:01.400,0:12:07.580
Before raising my hand I need to call Jesus to help me - Jesus.

0:12:07.580,0:12:09.120
I want to comb my hair.

0:12:09.120,0:12:15.780
Before making an effort - Jesus.

0:12:15.780,0:12:21.180
Because faith is practical.

0:12:21.180,0:12:31.420
Like children know their father; children depend on their father for everything.

0:12:31.420,0:12:36.780
Daddy, mummy - they depend on their father for everything.

0:12:36.780,0:12:42.220
There is nothing good children want to do on their own.

0:12:42.220,0:12:44.340
Good children.

0:12:44.340,0:12:48.440
There is nothing good children want to do on their own.

0:12:48.440,0:12:51.980
They will call their daddy for everything.

0:12:51.980,0:12:53.080
You are His children.

0:12:53.080,0:12:54.940
The Bible calls us children.

0:12:54.940,0:12:58.460
We children - greater is He that is in us.

0:12:58.460,0:13:01.000
He never called you an adult.

0:13:01.000,0:13:02.800
He never called you "baba".

0:13:02.800,0:13:06.440
He never called you "mumma" but you are the one calling yourself "mumma".

0:13:06.440,0:13:12.700
Mumma, baba, daddy - those names do not enter Heaven.

0:13:12.700,0:13:19.820
In Heaven they know you as children.

0:13:19.820,0:13:28.180
You can continue to enjoy being called different names; father, mumma, baba, sister, uncle, this, that,

0:13:28.180,0:13:30.960
pastor, prophet - you enjoy it.

0:13:30.960,0:13:37.240
But when you get there you are children.

0:13:37.240,0:13:46.240
Because of those different names being used you think that you can do things yourself.

0:13:46.240,0:13:48.640
That is the problem you are having today.

0:13:48.640,0:13:54.480
Before God, you are a child.

0:13:54.480,0:13:56.800
Total dependence on God.

0:13:56.800,0:14:01.020
When you want to eat - Jesus.

0:14:01.020,0:14:04.300
When you want to wash your hands - Jesus.

0:14:04.300,0:14:07.380
When you want to comb your hair - Jesus.

0:14:07.380,0:14:11.060
When you want to wear your spectacles - Jesus.

0:14:11.060,0:14:13.600
When you want to sit down - Jesus.

0:14:13.600,0:14:15.960
When you want to stand up - Jesus.

0:14:15.960,0:14:17.380
When you want to take a bath - Jesus.

0:14:17.380,0:14:19.200
You want to dress - Jesus.

0:14:19.200,0:14:27.500
You want to greet, before you say "How are you?", you call Jesus

0:14:27.500,0:14:29.760
What is the name by which they know you in Heaven?

0:14:29.760,0:14:31.640
We are known as children of God.

0:14:31.640,0:14:33.500
Thank you.

0:14:33.500,0:14:38.460
So, mumma - your child is calling you, that is getting to your head.

0:14:38.460,0:14:39.860
Yes.

0:14:39.860,0:14:45.600
Because of that you believe that you can tie your hair on your own.

0:14:45.760,0:14:47.680
Mummy, mummy.

0:14:47.680,0:14:49.640
Yes, sir. I believe.

0:14:49.640,0:14:50.780
What do you need to do now?

0:14:50.780,0:14:54.300
I need to realise... even to humble myself the more.

0:14:54.300,0:14:56.480
Before the God I am a child.

0:14:56.480,0:14:58.280
What do you need to do as a child?

0:14:58.280,0:15:02.240
I have to behave as a child and try to know my Father.

0:15:02.240,0:15:04.180
OK, can somebody help?

0:15:04.180,0:15:08.180
To depend entirely on Him, as He is the Father.

0:15:08.180,0:15:10.740
How does a child depend on the Father?

0:15:10.740,0:15:14.080
By having faith in Him, not believing that He would fail.

0:15:14.080,0:15:20.300
Rest - when your Father is around, knowing that He takes care of you.

0:15:20.300,0:15:22.940
Can somebody say it in a simple form?

0:15:22.940,0:15:24.920
Who are you now to God?

0:15:24.920,0:15:26.080
I'm a child of God.

0:15:26.080,0:15:27.480
You are a child of God?

0:15:27.480,0:15:31.460
Not a father of God, like your children call you?

0:15:31.460,0:15:32.860
I'm a child of God.

0:15:32.860,0:15:33.640
Not a father?

0:15:33.640,0:15:34.320
No.

0:15:34.320,0:15:35.040
Not an uncle?

0:15:35.040,0:15:35.540
No.

0:15:35.540,0:15:36.200
Not a brother?

0:15:36.200,0:15:36.960
No.

0:15:36.960,0:15:39.700
Not the MD of the company?

0:15:39.700,0:15:40.860
No.

0:15:40.860,0:15:43.160
Not the general overseer of the Synagogue?

0:15:43.160,0:15:46.640
No.

0:15:46.640,0:15:47.680
We need to know ourselves.

0:15:47.680,0:15:49.880
This is the problem we have today.

0:15:49.880,0:15:50.560
No.

0:15:50.560,0:15:53.960
Viewers at home, listen to me.

0:15:53.960,0:15:57.080
Nobody will preach this without a revelation.

0:15:57.080,0:15:58.380
It is a pure revelation.

0:15:58.380,0:16:07.240
I am coming out with a revelation that will solve your problem.

0:16:07.240,0:16:12.300
Revelation that will solve your problem.

0:16:12.300,0:16:19.320
Before your children - father, before your uncle - brother, before anybody - this, MD of the company -

0:16:19.320,0:16:24.760
I am the richest, general overseer, all this here - in the world.

0:16:24.760,0:16:29.660
But think of God - we are children.

0:16:29.660,0:16:39.440
If we are children of God, what is the position of a child to the father?

0:16:39.440,0:16:42.960
Total dependence!

0:16:42.960,0:16:47.020
When you want to talk - Jesus - before you talk.

0:16:47.020,0:16:49.300
When you want to run - Jesus.

0:16:49.300,0:16:52.360
Children cannot do anything on their own.

0:16:52.360,0:16:54.120
Can a child do anything on his own?

0:16:54.120,0:16:54.880
No.

0:16:54.880,0:17:03.500
That is you!

0:17:03.500,0:17:10.980
It’s a deep revelation. People have gone astray in the world.

0:17:10.980,0:17:20.480
Total dependence upon Him – you must know how much you need Him

0:17:20.480,0:17:25.460
just like your children at home need you.

0:17:25.460,0:17:26.760
Good children, not bad children.

0:17:26.760,0:17:28.860
We have some bad children.

0:17:28.860,0:17:35.120
When you are not at home, little children would open  your pot and eat your soup.

0:17:35.120,0:17:41.860
Total dependence upon Him – to talk, look, dress and do everything.

0:17:41.860,0:17:47.080
Forget about your pride in this world, the honour you receive from you children.

0:17:47.080,0:17:54.200
Members of your church would call you prophet, bishop, this, that, general overseer...

0:17:54.200,0:17:59.100
Sometimes, when I'm going you call me "general overseer of the Synagogue" - I don't listen to you.

0:17:59.100,0:18:00.760
Because I know...

0:18:00.760,0:18:03.120
Vanity upon vanity.

0:18:03.120,0:18:06.420
The general is in Heaven, I'm not a general.

0:18:06.420,0:18:12.400
I know you want to kill me.

0:18:12.400,0:18:26.320
Not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord; we should know Him like children know their father.

0:18:26.320,0:18:31.760
Do you actually know Him like children know their father?

0:18:31.760,0:18:38.000
You praise Him, you adore Him, you worship Him, you dance, you defend Him, everywhere you say,

0:18:38.000,0:18:42.340
"Jesus is the only Lord, He is the Redeemer, He is Savior".

0:18:42.340,0:18:44.080
There is nothing you cannot say about Jesus.

0:18:44.080,0:18:47.760
Even you begin to defend and begin to say, "I'm a Christian, I'm born-again"...

0:18:47.760,0:18:55.000
Are you really sure you know Jesus like children know their father?

0:18:55.000,0:18:57.100
You read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.

0:18:57.100,0:19:00.600
There is no verse you cannot quote, or refer to.

0:19:00.600,0:19:06.360
You can combat a battle, you can face anyone quoting the Bible.

0:19:06.360,0:19:08.900
You have a degree, you have a level...

0:19:08.900,0:19:10.780
There is no tittle we do not have.

0:19:10.780,0:19:13.780
We are prophets, bishops, we are that and that...

0:19:13.780,0:19:18.420
Do you know Him like children know their father?

0:19:18.420,0:19:27.960
Back to who we are – you are a child of God.

0:19:27.960,0:19:31.000
Anywhere you introduce yourself, you say, “I am a child of God”.

0:19:31.000,0:19:33.220
You say you are a father of God.

0:19:33.220,0:19:35.280
Do you ever say you are a father of God?

0:19:35.280,0:19:36.780
How do you introduce yourself?

0:19:36.780,0:19:37.760
As a child of God.

0:19:37.760,0:19:43.400
Why can’t you behave like a child to Him?

0:19:43.400,0:19:46.240
Why do you behave like a mumma to God?

0:19:46.240,0:19:47.760
Are you the one who gave birth to God?

0:19:47.760,0:19:48.660
No.

0:19:48.660,0:19:50.940
But the way you behave...

0:19:50.940,0:19:56.660
You only run to Him when you have difficulty or challenges.

0:19:56.660,0:19:58.680
You don’t know how much you need Him.

0:19:58.680,0:20:06.920
If you are a child of God, why can’t you know Him like children know their father?

0:20:06.920,0:20:09.100
The word "faith" is about this.

0:20:09.100,0:20:10.760
What is faith?

0:20:10.760,0:20:20.020
Faith is a heart that believes God through ordinary circumstances.

0:20:20.020,0:20:28.620
I need God to sit down, stand up, take my bath, dress up and wear my spectacles.

0:20:28.620,0:20:40.480
If you can carry God along in those ordinary issues, tell me big issue - you will slip on His what?

0:20:40.480,0:20:42.960
The best way to live life is what I'm telling you today.

0:20:42.960,0:20:48.720
You are a child of God, why can’t you behave like a child to Him?

0:20:48.720,0:20:55.060
Behave like a child of God.

0:20:55.060,0:20:57.540
It is not too late.

0:20:57.540,0:20:59.560
You must know how much you need Him.

0:20:59.560,0:21:04.340
You need Him to sit down, you need Him to eat, you need Him to drink, you need Him to sleep,

0:21:04.340,0:21:06.220
you need Him to wake up, you need Him to greet.

0:21:06.220,0:21:09.940
You need Him even to put on your spectacles - you cannot do it yourself.

0:21:09.940,0:21:12.260
Say, "I cannot do it".

0:21:12.260,0:21:14.920
I cannot wear it myself, wear it for me God.

0:21:14.920,0:21:16.520
I'm a child.

0:21:16.520,0:21:18.080
Let someone say, "I'm a child".

0:21:18.080,0:21:19.420
I'm a child.

0:21:19.420,0:21:22.480
Wear my spectacles for me.

0:21:22.480,0:21:23.780
You need this strength.

0:21:23.780,0:21:26.700
You think this strength is yours - it is not yours.

0:21:26.700,0:21:29.220
You are fake.

0:21:29.220,0:21:39.340
You think you have strength, you can wear spectacles by yourself - it's God's strength but you fail to recognize it.

0:21:39.340,0:21:47.060
When an attack comes, and the hand is paralyzed, you will recognize God.

0:21:47.060,0:21:49.800
I never knew it was Your strength.

0:21:49.800,0:21:53.100
All this time I thought it was my strength.

0:21:53.100,0:21:57.840
Anytime you want to wear your spectacles you just pick it.

0:21:57.840,0:22:04.640
You fail to know that it is God's strength, but you will know this when an attack comes.

0:22:04.640,0:22:12.080
When satat attacks, and the hand is paralyzed, you will begin to ask God for a deliverance, healing.

0:22:12.080,0:22:15.080
You would say, "Help me God. Let me move" - you recognize Him.

0:22:15.080,0:22:18.460
Please - don't wait for that.

0:22:18.460,0:22:19.980
Say, “It’s Your strength Lord.”

0:22:19.980,0:22:21.420
It’s Your strength Lord

0:22:21.420,0:22:22.640
to sit.

0:22:22.640,0:22:25.400
It’s Your strength to stand.

0:22:25.400,0:22:27.880
It’s Your strength to greet.

0:22:27.880,0:22:45.200
It’s Your strength to look, sleep, love and to do all.

0:22:45.200,0:22:47.400
Start your Christian life from there.

0:22:47.400,0:22:49.600
There are many preachers here.

0:22:49.600,0:22:51.900
Preachers, sitting down here.

0:22:51.900,0:22:58.020
If I gave them the microphone to preach, nobody would listen to me.

0:22:58.020,0:22:59.620
They are on their seats.

0:22:59.620,0:23:10.820
My brothers - let us close our Bibles, let's listen to the revelation.

0:23:10.820,0:23:14.520
It is only a revelation that can solve our problem.

0:23:14.520,0:23:15.720
What can solve our problem?

0:23:15.720,0:23:16.700
Revelation.

0:23:16.700,0:23:17.660
I cannot hear you.

0:23:17.660,0:23:21.820
Revelation.

0:23:21.820,0:23:30.820
Look, this Bible, before it becomes revelation to you, you must first meditate it.

0:23:30.820,0:23:34.700
By meditation, revelation comes out of it.

0:23:34.700,0:23:38.020
For now it is the Bible.

0:23:38.020,0:23:44.240
For this Bible to become revelation, you must meditate it.

0:23:44.240,0:24:02.700
By meditation and turning it over and over, in your heart, it becomes a revelation.

0:24:02.700,0:24:06.260
Meditation turns to revelation.

0:24:06.260,0:24:27.660
Meditation on what you read, turn it over and over in your heart...

0:24:27.660,0:24:33.080
To turn something in your heart, you know when something is going in your heart,

0:24:33.080,0:24:35.680
it's going through what?

0:24:35.680,0:24:37.360
This thing.

0:24:37.360,0:24:41.740
Go over and over in your heart - that becomes a revelation.

0:24:41.740,0:24:52.460
The process of turning over in your heart is no longer in your mouth.

0:24:52.460,0:25:00.600
Then it can affect you, become a "character".

0:25:00.600,0:25:06.960
Let me use an example of the Bible - anyone can but it.

0:25:06.960,0:25:12.900
When you get to the market they will never ask you, "Are you a Christian?" before giving you a copy.

0:25:12.900,0:25:15.520
All they need is money.

0:25:15.520,0:25:20.980
That is to tell you - you make it work.

0:25:20.980,0:25:27.540
If you are a bad person your Bible is also bad.

0:25:27.540,0:25:32.820
If you are good your Bible is good.

0:25:32.820,0:25:38.880
That is why everybody has access to it.

0:25:38.880,0:25:50.320
Now - to make it a revelation, it must go through a meditation in your heart.

0:25:50.320,0:25:51.600
It must go through what?

0:25:51.600,0:25:52.780
Meditation.

0:25:52.780,0:25:58.280
Meditation can only occur in our heart.

0:25:58.280,0:26:02.020
Remember, there is a difference between meditation and thinking.

0:26:02.020,0:26:07.740
Meditation is a higher level, while thinking is a lower level.

0:26:07.740,0:26:09.960
Upper class, lower class.

0:26:09.960,0:26:12.600
When you are worried, you are thinking.

0:26:12.600,0:26:15.800
You never worry and meditate.

0:26:15.800,0:26:20.600
Until you are free of worry, then you can meditate.

0:26:20.600,0:26:29.680
Tell your neighbour, “I’m a child of God – total dependence on Him;

0:26:29.680,0:26:33.640
I should know how much I need Him.

0:26:33.640,0:26:49.340
I need Him to do everything, even to talk or look I need Him."

0:26:49.340,0:26:57.880
I need You more and more

0:26:57.880,0:27:06.100
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:27:06.100,0:27:14.700
I need You more and more

0:27:14.700,0:27:20.320
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:27:20.320,0:27:29.880
I need You more and more

0:27:29.880,0:27:36.340
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:27:36.340,0:27:49.380
I need You more and more

0:27:49.380,0:27:53.880
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:27:53.880,0:27:59.320
Like a flower needs the rain

0:27:59.320,0:28:03.240
Like a bird needs the wind

0:28:03.240,0:28:09.500
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:28:09.520,0:28:14.080
I need You more and more

0:28:14.080,0:28:20.220
More

0:28:20.220,0:28:27.240
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:28:27.260,0:28:31.180
I need You more and more

0:28:31.200,0:28:32.520
More

0:28:32.520,0:28:38.460
Lord, I need You more and more

0:28:38.460,0:28:45.940
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:28:45.940,0:28:49.840
You may be seated. Thank You, Lord.

0:28:49.840,0:28:54.420
I want you to write it in your book.

0:28:54.420,0:29:02.580
Today, you are a child of God and you should behave like a child to the father.

0:29:02.580,0:29:04.680
You are a child of God.

0:29:04.680,0:29:10.140
I said, "you may be seated" - you sat without even carrying God along.

0:29:10.140,0:29:15.240
You have forgotten because you are used to those your fake power.

0:29:15.240,0:29:20.720
Because you are a child, you need God to do all.

0:29:20.720,0:29:26.760
You introduce yourself as a child of God but you behave otherwise.

0:29:26.760,0:29:39.480
This why we see people who claim to believe, who don't know how to believe and express their faith.

0:29:39.480,0:29:45.720
What we do expresses what we believe.

0:29:45.720,0:29:59.360
If there is faith, there must be work that corresponds with that faith.

0:29:59.360,0:30:06.580
Faith is expressed through work.

0:30:06.580,0:30:10.940
By this work, faith is perfected.

0:30:10.940,0:30:16.620
By this work, faith is proved.

0:30:16.620,0:30:23.080
By this work, faith is completed.

0:30:23.080,0:30:32.280
If faith and work do not agree, there must be something wrong with our faith.

0:30:32.280,0:30:38.180
It is either faith in faith or faith in ourselves.

0:30:38.180,0:30:41.540
Self righteousness.

0:30:41.540,0:30:44.780
I repeat.

0:30:44.780,0:30:55.180
If faith and work do not agree, there must be something wrong with our faith.

0:30:55.180,0:31:04.980
It is either faith in faith or faith in ourselves.

0:31:04.980,0:31:16.760
Faith in what man has done: science, knowledge, just mention it.

0:31:16.760,0:31:23.020
What we have faith in is what man has done - it is what we have faith in.

0:31:23.020,0:31:31.260
Sometimes, when we enter a church we can see the crowd, we see a beautiful church - we have faith in it.

0:31:31.260,0:31:45.800
Oh, big church, many wonderful people, president - that is enough for our faith.

0:31:45.800,0:31:53.380
Or the way ministers of God preach, "I tell you - God is love" - it is a good preacher.

0:31:53.380,0:31:56.720
That is enough for our faith.

0:31:56.720,0:32:03.140
This can be regarded as "what man has done".

0:32:03.140,0:32:10.300
Faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ has to do with the supernatural.

0:32:10.300,0:32:12.780
Faith is practical.

0:32:12.780,0:32:15.960
It is as simple as a conviction.

0:32:15.960,0:32:24.520
It can not be expressed in abstracts.

0:32:24.520,0:32:32.120
That is why today people hide under the "belief" - I believe in Christ, I'm a believer...

0:32:32.120,0:32:38.720
The word "faith" has to do with a trust.

0:32:38.720,0:32:43.540
Finally – our work proves our faith.

0:32:43.540,0:32:46.140
What is your work?

0:32:46.140,0:32:55.460
Your work proves your faith.

0:32:55.460,0:32:59.900
Your work perfects your faith.

0:32:59.900,0:33:04.940
Because faith works together with its work.

0:33:04.940,0:33:06.780
I'm talking to the children of God.

0:33:06.780,0:33:08.140
Are you a child of God?

0:33:08.140,0:33:09.000
Yes.

0:33:09.000,0:33:10.120
I cannot hear you.

0:33:10.120,0:33:11.700
Yes.

0:33:11.700,0:33:14.720
Just recognize that you are a child.

0:33:14.720,0:33:17.620
And you know what a child needs from a father.

0:33:17.620,0:33:19.340
It is a total dependence.

0:33:19.340,0:33:24.040
There is nothing a child can do without the father.

0:33:24.040,0:33:27.680
You only call Him when an attack comes.

0:33:27.680,0:33:32.940
That is why He doesn't rescue you.

0:33:32.940,0:33:36.060
He knows you are calling Him for selfish reasons.

0:33:36.060,0:33:38.420
What are selfish reasons? It is just to rescue you.

0:33:38.420,0:33:44.820
After rescuing you, you will start living your own life - and He doesn't want that.

0:33:44.820,0:33:48.800
He wants your whole life, not a part of your life.

0:33:48.800,0:33:53.240
Go, and think about this.
