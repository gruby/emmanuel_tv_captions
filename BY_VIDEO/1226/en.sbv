0:00:00.000,0:00:03.780
Good Morning, people of God!

0:00:03.780,0:00:06.460

0:00:06.460,0:00:09.820
Say, "Neighbour, Good Morning!"

0:00:09.820,0:00:13.960
Greet the viewers, say, "Viewers, Good Morning!"

0:00:13.960,0:00:17.360
Indeed, Good Morning to your life today!

0:00:17.360,0:00:19.880

Good Morning to your destiny!

0:00:24.580,0:00:26.720
It is a new dawn!

0:00:26.720,0:00:31.600

0:00:35.900,0:00:38.400
Hallelujah!

0:00:38.400,0:00:40.680
Have your seat in His presence.

0:00:40.680,0:00:43.900
That joy shall be permanent.

0:00:43.900,0:00:48.460
It shall be permanent.

0:00:48.460,0:00:56.960
Please, forget the trouble that brought you here; it is no more a trouble.

0:00:56.960,0:01:05.000
Forget that problem that brought you here; it is no longer a problem because Jesus is alive.

0:01:05.000,0:01:08.700
Jesus is alive!

0:01:08.700,0:01:11.560
Thank You, Jesus, for the grace to be here today.

0:01:11.560,0:01:14.000
My name is Racine.

0:01:14.000,0:01:18.340
I am an evangelist here by the grace of God under my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:18.340,0:01:25.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:25.700,0:01:31.780
As you see me, God has done a miracle in my life.

0:01:31.780,0:01:35.620
If you saw me where I was before,

0:01:35.620,0:01:40.500
you would never believe that such a man could stand in your presence today.

0:01:40.500,0:01:45.240
God has visited my life through Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:45.240,0:01:51.260
and today, the same God will touch your life.

0:01:51.260,0:01:54.880
I want you to have the assurance I have today.

0:01:54.880,0:01:59.160
You may be having trouble deep inside your heart.

0:01:59.160,0:02:03.200
Trouble must have brought you here, but let me tell you,

0:02:03.200,0:02:09.320
there is Someone somewhere who is aware of your situation.

0:02:09.320,0:02:14.680
No matter how long you have been in darkness, the light shines.

0:02:14.680,0:02:19.600
The Scripture says, the prophetic light is the light shining in the darkness.

0:02:19.600,0:02:26.560
When you come out of darkness, you remain faithful to the light forever - Jesus is the light.

0:02:26.560,0:02:30.460
Thank You, Jesus, for my life.

0:02:30.460,0:02:35.740
Brethren, I want to just tell you a very short story about me.

0:02:35.740,0:02:37.180
Like many African people here,

0:02:37.180,0:02:46.140
we believe that the greener pastures are when we go to the western world - that,  I did.

0:02:46.140,0:02:55.820
I lived there for twenty-two years - worked with people, met different people.

0:02:55.820,0:03:00.700
I thought I had 'arrived' - on the outside.

0:03:00.700,0:03:09.260
But one day, after eighteen years, something happened.

0:03:09.260,0:03:14.540
Something happened that turned my life around.

0:03:14.540,0:03:21.020
All that I counted dear, important, collapsed in one day.

0:03:21.020,0:03:25.460
That business I was proud of collapsed.

0:03:25.460,0:03:33.880
That relationship I was into for so long collapsed in one day - on the eve of Christmas, 1998.

0:03:33.880,0:03:38.560
I found myself stranded in a foreign country where I knew nobody.

0:03:38.560,0:03:47.100
I found myself on the streets, stranded - nowhere to go. I did not know anybody.

0:03:47.100,0:03:50.660
I had my bag and the phone I had switched off.

0:03:50.660,0:03:55.820
I was roaming about with nowhere to go, on a Christmas day.

0:03:55.820,0:04:00.280
That day my whole life said: "Is this what you have come to do in this country?

0:04:00.280,0:04:03.860
What are you going to do? What is the way out?"

0:04:03.860,0:04:08.700
Imagine what can go through the heart of such a person

0:04:08.700,0:04:14.900
Happening on the day of Christmas - everybody in his home fellowshipping, dancing and dining.

0:04:14.900,0:04:17.000
I was looking for a hotel and I could not find any.

0:04:17.000,0:04:21.300
I entered one hotel one day.

0:04:21.300,0:04:24.300
I was overwhelmed.

0:04:24.300,0:04:30.500
I entered that room tired, and I slept.

0:04:30.500,0:04:34.060
And I had a dream.

0:04:34.060,0:04:43.540
I dreamt - I saw a mountain, a very high mountain and I was like a baby

0:04:43.540,0:04:46.700
â€“ eight months old baby wearing diapers.

0:04:46.700,0:04:49.240
I looked at the mountain - so high.

0:04:49.240,0:04:59.240
When I turned, I saw a man, as tall as the mountain - a black man, having a beard.

0:04:59.240,0:05:03.840
I looked at the mountain; I looked at the man. I said, "How can I go there?"

0:05:03.840,0:05:07.780
I looked at the man; the man looked at me and smiled.

0:05:07.780,0:05:09.520
I woke up.

0:05:09.520,0:05:13.580
When I woke up, something strange happened to me.

0:05:13.580,0:05:16.900
There was a small light, as if you lit a candle

0:05:16.900,0:05:21.340
At that moment, I said, "Who is this man?"

0:05:21.340,0:05:25.760
My focus changed immediately. I forgot about my trouble.

0:05:25.760,0:05:30.480
I said, "Who is this man?"

0:05:30.480,0:05:33.900
I looked for that man - from town to town.

0:05:33.900,0:05:36.540
I travelled to different countries to look for that man.

0:05:36.540,0:05:41.860
Anytime I heard, "There is man of God here", I ran there.

0:05:41.860,0:05:47.200
After four years, my life had not changed - the trouble was still there.

0:05:47.200,0:05:58.860
One day, I said, "God, if that dream is true, I will not allow water or food to enter my mouth

0:05:58.860,0:06:02.380
until you reveal to me that person".

0:06:02.380,0:06:10.400
For good six to seven days, I was there. And something happened.

0:06:10.400,0:06:13.700
Let somebody say, "Something happened".

0:06:13.700,0:06:19.780
On Monday, a friend called me and said, "Let's go to the prayer meeting

0:06:19.780,0:06:24.600
because they are going to show something very special and very strange".

0:06:24.600,0:06:27.980
So I went there.

0:06:27.980,0:06:30.560
What I saw shocked me.

0:06:30.560,0:06:37.800
The man I saw in the dream - they were calling that man, "The Man In The Synagogue".

0:06:37.800,0:06:43.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:43.200,0:06:48.300
When they played that video, I saw a man sitting on the ground -

0:06:48.300,0:06:51.040
the buttocks were eaten by worms.

0:06:51.040,0:06:54.300
The man was abandoned; I was shocked to see the image.

0:06:54.300,0:06:58.840
I said, "How can this person live?"

0:06:58.840,0:07:01.380
Immediately, he came and prayed for that man.

0:07:01.380,0:07:08.640
When I saw the video, the man was healed, delivered - as if he was never sick.

0:07:08.640,0:07:11.640
I said, "This is the man".

0:07:11.640,0:07:16.400
The SCOAN Sunday Live Service

0:07:16.400,0:07:19.940
I began to say God: "How can I go there, how can I see him?"

0:07:19.940,0:07:25.780
I slept and another dream came, showing me the map of Africa.

0:07:25.780,0:07:31.660
Nigeria was like a heartbeat.

0:07:31.660,0:07:37.400
When I got to my office the next day, I told my boss, "I want to go to Nigeria".

0:07:37.400,0:07:44.220
He looked at me and said, "What happened to you? Are you crazy?"

0:07:44.220,0:07:49.900
I said, "No. There is a prophet there; I want to go and see him".

0:07:49.900,0:07:54.400
Before I realised it, he came to me, took a cheque book,

0:07:54.400,0:07:57.900
signed a cheque and got my ticket.

0:07:57.900,0:08:02.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:02.540,0:08:08.040
So, I came here on February 2002.

0:08:08.040,0:08:14.460
On that fateful Sunday Service, the prophet saw me in his office.

0:08:14.460,0:08:19.000
When I entered, I couldn't talk. He gave me this.

0:08:19.000,0:08:29.920
This paper you see, has now been with me for good 16 years.

0:08:29.920,0:08:37.120
He looked at me and said, "What are you doing? God has a plan for you".

0:08:37.120,0:08:39.020
My dear brother,

0:08:39.020,0:08:47.380
if you don't know where you are destined to be, your destiny will be changed forever.

0:08:47.380,0:08:50.460
He gave me this; I took it and I read.

0:08:50.460,0:08:55.980
It says, "God will give you all that He has for His heirs".

0:08:55.980,0:09:04.780
That day, I understood that I am a child of promise.

0:09:04.780,0:09:09.720
So I wrote on the back: Sunday, 3 March 2002.

0:09:09.720,0:09:14.760
Immediately I read, something crossed my mind and said,

0:09:14.760,0:09:20.660
"If you believe in God, you will succeed. If you believe His prophet, you will prosper".

0:09:20.660,0:09:24.700
So, I went to the Scriptures and wrote down 2 Chronicles 20:20.

0:09:24.700,0:09:33.660
Today, my dream has come to pass.

0:09:33.660,0:09:37.560
What I want to tell you:

0:09:37.560,0:09:44.120
We are living in a world full of trouble but that trouble you are in today,

0:09:44.120,0:09:50.560
God may use it to release you to your future.

0:09:50.560,0:09:53.140
I'm telling you this to let you know that:

0:09:53.140,0:10:00.040
If you are in a situation, if what you are feeling in your heart is contrary to your heart's desire,

0:10:00.040,0:10:07.740
pause, take the time to change your focus, right now.

0:10:07.740,0:10:12.000
Stop thinking about your problem and start engaging your heart with God.

0:10:12.000,0:10:17.760
There is something in you that you need to discover.

0:10:17.760,0:10:21.860
Can I ask you one question?

0:10:21.860,0:10:34.780
How clearly do you see the world around you today?

0:10:34.780,0:10:41.440
When you look at your own life, what do you see?

0:10:41.440,0:10:49.300
When you look at your life, what do you see?

0:10:49.300,0:10:59.040
If you say you see setback, limitation, poverty, trouble, let me ask you the following question:

0:10:59.040,0:11:05.420
What does Jesus see when He is looking at you?

0:11:05.420,0:11:10.100
There is more to life than meets the ordinary eye -

0:11:10.100,0:11:16.180
there is man's point of view and we have eternity's perspective.

0:11:16.180,0:11:22.240
Which one is ruling your life today?

0:11:22.240,0:11:28.700
Look around you and you will see that many people are complaining, lamenting, crying,

0:11:28.700,0:11:36.620
weeping every day because their lives are centred, focused on what they are doing,

0:11:36.620,0:11:41.860
how they are feeling, how they are treated.

0:11:41.860,0:11:47.740
Worry destroys our sense of judgement; it makes the heart sick.

0:11:47.740,0:11:49.840
It affects your heart.

0:11:49.840,0:11:58.980
And the prophet says, our behavior is determined by the condition of our heart.

0:11:58.980,0:12:06.240
If you confess failure, you put failure on the throne.

0:12:06.240,0:12:09.740
Are you complaining about your life today?

0:12:09.740,0:12:18.280
if you do, it's because your heart is that way.

0:12:18.280,0:12:25.420
If you complain, it means your heart is that way.

0:12:25.420,0:12:32.140
With your complaints, you are constantly painting a public picture of your inner self -

0:12:32.140,0:12:36.120
the man himself, the real you.

0:12:36.120,0:12:40.320
But I have good news for you today.

0:12:40.320,0:12:47.020
When you realise that your heart is the fountain of all that you do,

0:12:47.020,0:12:54.400
then, you will see the need to allow Jesus to intervene on the inside of you.

0:12:54.400,0:12:57.900
Today, He wants to rebuild your life.

0:12:57.900,0:13:00.380
He wants to remove your tears.

0:13:00.380,0:13:04.400
He wants to show that there is something bigger than your problem.

0:13:04.400,0:13:06.860
Are you ready? Will you allow Him?

0:13:06.860,0:13:09.760
Change your focus.

0:13:09.760,0:13:19.480
Rebuilding you starts on the inside of you; it requires your attention.

0:13:19.480,0:13:23.760
By faith, listen to Jesus in the inner room.

0:13:23.760,0:13:36.140
By faith, listen to Him in the inner room telling you,

0:13:36.140,0:13:44.660
"Come to Me all you who are heavy laden and I will give you My rest".

0:13:44.660,0:13:51.240
When you step into the presence of Jesus, your thinking will change,

0:13:51.240,0:13:56.500
your attitude will change, everything about you will change.

0:13:56.500,0:14:02.600
You will no longer look at yourself in the natural; you will know what God says about you.

0:14:02.600,0:14:04.060
Are you ready?

0:14:04.060,0:14:08.220
Say, "Neighbour, keep focus.

0:14:08.220,0:14:11.060
Identify your source".

0:14:11.060,0:14:15.420
This leads me to our message today: FOCUS ON GOD.

0:14:15.420,0:14:17.980
Let someone say, "Focus on God".

0:14:17.980,0:14:20.660
Say, "Neighbour, focus on God".

0:14:20.660,0:14:26.040
Say to yourself, "My heart - focus on God".

0:14:26.040,0:14:36.340
Let me take you to the book of Hebrews 12. Let me start from verse 1.

0:14:36.340,0:14:43.280
"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,

0:14:43.280,0:14:50.100
let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us,

0:14:50.100,0:14:56.640
and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,

0:14:56.640,0:15:02.180
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

0:15:02.180,0:15:07.700
who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,

0:15:07.700,0:15:15.380
despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."

0:15:15.380,0:15:22.440
Let someone say: A seat of power with power.

0:15:22.440,0:15:26.300
Focus on God.

0:15:26.300,0:15:32.640
You are what you give your attention to.

0:15:32.640,0:15:38.160
What you are looking at affects your thoughts.

0:15:38.160,0:15:43.600
A man's life is what his thoughts make it.

0:15:43.600,0:15:52.180
My life is what my thoughts make it.

0:15:52.180,0:15:59.620
Your behaviour and conduct cannot change until Jesus gives birth to a picture in you

0:15:59.620,0:16:05.320
of what He is looking at when He sees you.

0:16:05.320,0:16:11.320
When you focus on God today, you are indeed what God says you are

0:16:11.320,0:16:16.780
and you have what God says you have.

0:16:16.780,0:16:23.480
Daniel was a captive but he never referred to himself as a captive

0:16:23.480,0:16:28.800
because he steadfastly focused on his God and knew who he was.

0:16:28.800,0:16:35.300
That enabled him to have a mighty breakthrough and he became a biblical hero of faith.

0:16:35.300,0:16:40.200
Get connected.

0:16:40.200,0:16:47.340
No matter the trouble, get connected by faith.

0:16:47.340,0:16:54.920
When you discover what God has made you for, your life will change.

0:16:54.920,0:16:58.840
When you connect to God, when you focus on God,

0:16:58.840,0:17:06.920
then you will realise what God has made you for and how He cherishes your company.

0:17:06.920,0:17:19.000
Mankind is designed by God to think with God, plan with God, act with God and talk with God.

0:17:19.000,0:17:34.460
No state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.

0:17:34.460,0:17:38.540
Are you living in tune with God?

0:17:38.540,0:17:45.840
Are you planning with Him? Are you acting with Him?

0:17:45.840,0:17:50.720
Acting on the Word of God builds faith in the heart of the believer

0:17:50.720,0:17:53.860
because faith focuses on Jesus.

0:17:53.860,0:17:59.420
Faith focuses on Jesus.

0:17:59.420,0:18:02.780
Look to the cross.

0:18:02.780,0:18:13.080
By looking at God, looking unto God, meditating on God, faith comes spontaneously.

0:18:13.080,0:18:18.820
Jesus Christ possesses a nature that makes us to believe in Him.

0:18:18.820,0:18:27.140
He possesses a nature that makes it easy to believe and trust in Him.

0:18:27.140,0:18:33.100
When you realise how reliable the Lord is, faith comes naturally.

0:18:33.100,0:18:36.260
Faith comes naturally.

0:18:36.260,0:18:42.500
Say with a smile, "Faith comes naturally".

0:18:42.500,0:18:50.760
The transforming promise Jesus Christ offers you and I today is liberation.

0:18:50.760,0:18:55.860
With this liberation, you will no longer be ruled by your situation.

0:18:55.860,0:18:58.740
You will no longer be ruled by your senses.

0:18:58.740,0:19:04.680
He is here today to deliver you from it.

0:19:04.680,0:19:08.300
He is here to offer you the kind of liberation...

0:19:08.300,0:19:13.320
The Bible says, if the Son of God sets you free, you are free indeed.

0:19:13.320,0:19:16.220
I am free indeed.

0:19:16.220,0:19:21.960
I refuse to look at my problem - I focus on Him.

0:19:21.960,0:19:26.580
Once you focus on Him, your life will never remain the same again.

0:19:26.580,0:19:31.540
You will know what we call the 'dividend of democracy'.

0:19:31.540,0:19:38.140
The dividend of living in tune with God.

0:19:38.140,0:19:40.760
What is it?

0:19:40.760,0:19:48.900
Once you make Jesus Christ of Nazareth your CEO, your Director,

0:19:48.900,0:19:53.240
you become one directed by the Heavenly Father.

0:19:53.240,0:20:00.820
You become a man or woman wired, connected to the Heavenly Father.

0:20:00.820,0:20:07.960
Then, you will know that there is nobody and there will be nobody quite like you.

0:20:07.960,0:20:10.580
You are unique.

0:20:10.580,0:20:18.640
There is nobody, there will be nobody quite like me.

0:20:18.640,0:20:22.940
Stop comparing yourself with others.

0:20:22.940,0:20:30.920
Once you realise that, you will have a sensitivity you never had before.

0:20:30.920,0:20:37.000
You will know God as children know their father.

0:20:37.000,0:20:42.880
You will know God's opinion about yourself and others.

0:20:42.880,0:20:48.100
You will have a relationship with God Almighty.

0:20:48.100,0:21:06.740
And the man of God says: A sense of fatherhood will produce a natural basis for prayer.

0:21:06.740,0:21:19.220
And he said: "The greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants us to pray".

0:21:19.220,0:21:25.540
The greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants you to pray.

0:21:25.540,0:21:29.900
When you do, you will want what God wants

0:21:29.900,0:21:32.820
and you will want it for the reason God wants it.

0:21:32.820,0:21:39.800
Whatever you ask shall be provided.

0:21:39.800,0:21:53.900
One is rewarded when he prays, laughs, looks and smiles in faith.

0:21:53.900,0:22:01.840
The Spirit of Father dwelling in your heart will enable you to cry out, "Abba Father!" naturally.

0:22:01.840,0:22:09.560
He will allow you to pray naturally, speak naturally.

0:22:09.560,0:22:15.820
When you pray in love and faith, God prays.

0:22:15.820,0:22:23.380
When you talk in love and faith, God talks.

0:22:23.380,0:22:27.260
Let someone say: "The dividend of democracy".

0:22:27.260,0:22:34.600
Say, "Neighbour, focus on God".

0:22:34.600,0:22:42.680
If you focus on your problem, you lose focus on God.

0:22:42.680,0:22:52.520
Focus on God Almighty and not on the problem - no matter what comes, no matter what happens.

0:22:52.520,0:22:58.500
Look at what happened to the Israelites at the point of entering the promised land.

0:22:58.500,0:23:01.740
They focused on their giant.

0:23:01.740,0:23:04.520
Fear took hold of them

0:23:04.520,0:23:09.540
and fear increased the size of their giant, mentally.

0:23:09.540,0:23:17.420
They began to exalt their giant above God and they destroyed their confidence in God.

0:23:17.420,0:23:20.620
Whatever your situation is -

0:23:20.620,0:23:22.620
is it barrenness?

0:23:22.620,0:23:24.440
Is it poverty?

0:23:24.440,0:23:26.440
Is it family curse?

0:23:26.440,0:23:31.420
No matter what it is, focus on God.

0:23:31.420,0:23:42.200
Ask Hannah, she will tell you that a lack of absolute confidence in what they believe

0:23:42.200,0:23:46.540
is what causes people today to lose focus and balance

0:23:46.540,0:23:51.580
when the answer to their prayers seems to delay.

0:23:51.580,0:24:00.400
A lack of absolute trust in what they believe is what causes people to lose focus and balance

0:24:00.400,0:24:03.820
when the answer to their prayers seems to delay.

0:24:03.820,0:24:09.940
They begin to look for alternatives.

0:24:09.940,0:24:16.160
What kept Hannah from despairing was not what she saw but what she believed -

0:24:16.160,0:24:24.340
because she knew, she learnt the value of focusing on God.

0:24:24.340,0:24:29.000
The Scripture says that she was faced with

0:24:29.000,0:24:38.100
a seemingly overwhelming natural circumstance of barrenness for so many years

0:24:38.100,0:24:48.860
but she refused to give up to that voice of discouragement that was howling over her mind

0:24:48.860,0:24:52.640
because she was conscious of her faith.

0:24:52.640,0:24:57.420
She focused on God Almighty.

0:24:57.420,0:25:02.620
As you are sitting down, whatever giant that is troubling your heart -

0:25:02.620,0:25:06.640
Jesus is greater than all.

0:25:06.640,0:25:11.700
She ran to God's presence in prayer.

0:25:11.700,0:25:20.620
Prayer is not saying words.

0:25:20.620,0:25:26.880
She ran into God's presence and she prayed.

0:25:26.880,0:25:33.840
She was silent but her faith was not silent.

0:25:33.840,0:25:37.660
She poured out her heart before God

0:25:37.660,0:25:45.660
and the Bible says her heart was deeply engaged with God Almighty.

0:25:45.660,0:25:50.740
Immediately she heard the Word of faith, she believed

0:25:50.740,0:25:55.140
and the state of her mind was renewed instantly.

0:25:55.140,0:26:06.720
God's Word refreshes my mind; God's Spirit renews my strength.

0:26:06.720,0:26:10.120
Engage your heart as you are sitting down.

0:26:10.120,0:26:12.540
He is in our midst.

0:26:12.540,0:26:22.080
God Almighty is in the house through His Word, by His Spirit.

0:26:22.080,0:26:28.220
Jesus Christ listens to us when we pray

0:26:28.220,0:26:36.160
and He replies according to the state of our mind.

0:26:36.160,0:26:39.240
What is the state of your mind?

0:26:39.240,0:26:43.920
What is going through you right now?

0:26:43.920,0:26:46.760
She believed the Word and the Bible says,

0:26:46.760,0:26:51.720
immediately, she looked beyond her circumstance.

0:26:51.720,0:26:57.060
She looked beyond the state of barrenness and saw herself in a future state of fruitfulness.

0:26:57.060,0:27:03.260
as if it was already there, as if it was already true.

0:27:03.260,0:27:05.260
Her behaviour changed.

0:27:05.260,0:27:14.880
Say, "Neighbour, prayer changes me; faith causes things to happen".

0:27:14.880,0:27:17.280
It will happen for you today.

0:27:17.280,0:27:25.940
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:25.940,0:27:32.640
A humble believing soul that truly loves Jesus Christ

0:27:32.640,0:27:37.780
takes everything Jesus says and does it in good faith

0:27:37.780,0:27:45.180
and puts the best construction on it.

0:27:45.180,0:27:48.860
When she heard and she believed, her behaviour changed.

0:27:48.860,0:27:54.880
Immediately, she removed the garment of sorrow and a smile enlightened her face

0:27:54.880,0:28:01.320
because she believed that her request for a child was granted by God

0:28:01.320,0:28:09.620
and indeed, Samuel, the great prophet and judge was born.

0:28:09.620,0:28:12.720
What is your giant?

0:28:12.720,0:28:18.560
What is the problem that brought you here today?

0:28:18.560,0:28:24.000
As you are seated, check your heart.

0:28:24.000,0:28:33.640
Whatever you are experiencing now that is contrary to your heart's desire - stop!

0:28:33.640,0:28:36.220
Stop thinking about your problem.

0:28:36.220,0:28:40.700
Take time to change your focus because you are in His presence.

0:28:40.700,0:29:02.700
Say, "Neighbour, listen to my voice. If you run out of rope, grab onto faith".

0:29:02.700,0:29:07.340
Don't run from God; run to God

0:29:07.340,0:29:22.380
and that hope, that promise will become a reality.

0:29:22.380,0:29:29.220
Jesus said in John 8:12, "I am the light of the world.

0:29:29.220,0:29:39.500
He who follows Me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life".

0:29:39.500,0:29:49.360
The only way you can see life clearly is to focus on Jesus.

0:29:49.360,0:29:55.580
It is not your mere wishful thinking but your rightful focus on Him

0:29:55.580,0:30:01.320
that determines who you are before God.

0:30:01.320,0:30:08.940
It is not your mere wishful thinking but your rightful focus

0:30:08.940,0:30:14.100
that determines who you are before God.

0:30:14.100,0:30:21.020
Focus on God, not on the problem.

0:30:21.020,0:30:24.620
Focus on Him.

0:30:24.620,0:30:33.660
What you regard as failure is not failure at all from eternity's perspective.

0:30:33.660,0:30:43.300
That problem, that trouble is not failure from eternity's perspective.

0:30:43.300,0:30:47.680
You need to know what God says about the situation.

0:30:47.680,0:30:50.520
You need to know what God says about you.

0:30:50.520,0:30:53.720
It is within you - it is hidden.

0:30:53.720,0:30:59.180
You need to discover it.

0:30:59.180,0:31:06.940
There is something in you that is dormant - as was my case.

0:31:06.940,0:31:13.600
Today is the day that the Lord has made.

0:31:13.600,0:31:16.900
I will rejoice and be glad in it.

0:31:16.900,0:31:25.860
If you believe, you will rejoice.

0:31:25.860,0:31:34.080
Focus on God Almighty, not on the trouble.

0:31:34.080,0:31:40.280
Your focus determines your response to the situation

0:31:40.280,0:31:46.580
and that response determines your future.

0:31:46.580,0:31:49.000
Look to God.

0:31:49.000,0:31:52.660
Discover it.

0:31:52.660,0:32:00.200
How do you discover it?

0:32:00.200,0:32:12.540
Meditation brings revelation.

0:32:12.540,0:32:19.200
As you are sitting down, that voice of condemnation, that voice of fear,

0:32:19.200,0:32:21.920
what people have been saying about you -

0:32:21.920,0:32:29.480
today, if you believe, you will get out of the wilderness.

0:32:29.480,0:32:36.020
Yielding your heart to the Word of God makes the Word of God a reality.

0:32:36.020,0:32:39.620
Yielding your heart to the Word of God makes the promise a reality

0:32:39.620,0:32:47.320
and when it does - the Bible says, you become Word-minded and God-minded.

0:32:47.320,0:32:55.240
When you are God-minded, you will know the mind of God about you and your situation.

0:32:55.240,0:33:03.400
The illumination of the Spirit of God will settle in your heart the truth from eternity's perspective.

0:33:03.400,0:33:14.720
The illumination of the Spirit of God will settle in my heart today the truth from eternity's perspective.

0:33:14.720,0:33:17.320
Look to Jesus.

0:33:17.320,0:33:25.100
Focusing on Jesus Christ of Nazareth puts everything else in its proper perspective.

0:33:25.100,0:33:31.340
Focusing on Him will put everything else in its proper perspective.

0:33:31.340,0:33:33.220
Are you barren?

0:33:33.220,0:33:38.040
Ask Hannah - you will see fruitfulness instead of barrenness.

0:33:38.040,0:33:42.240
You will see healing instead of sickness.

0:33:42.240,0:33:43.340
Are you poor?

0:33:43.340,0:33:48.580
Ask Jabez - you will see prosperity instead of setback.

0:33:48.580,0:33:50.500
Look to Jesus.

0:33:50.500,0:33:52.380
He has come to change your life.

0:33:52.380,0:34:04.200
He has changed my own; He will change your own if you believe.

0:34:04.200,0:34:11.900
King David, Daniel, Simon Peter, along with many heroes of faith -

0:34:11.900,0:34:18.620
they all struggled with various doubts in their lives

0:34:18.620,0:34:26.140
but they focused steadfastly on God Almighty and they prayed without ceasing.

0:34:26.140,0:34:30.020
They knew their enemy lost no time in plotting against them;

0:34:30.020,0:34:36.500
they lost no time in committing their lives to God Almighty.

0:34:36.500,0:34:51.380
The secret of a successful life is to learn to focus on God, not on the happenings around you.

0:34:51.380,0:34:53.680
Focus on Him.

0:34:53.680,0:35:04.040
No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, focus on God.

0:35:04.040,0:35:06.360
Engage your heart.

0:35:06.360,0:35:17.420
As you are sitting down, meditate on the Word of God and whatever you do will prosper.

0:35:17.420,0:35:19.560
Keep focus.

0:35:19.560,0:35:26.900
Tell your neighbour, "Keep focus; identify your Source".

0:35:26.900,0:35:29.220
Who is your Source?

0:35:29.220,0:35:34.780
Jesus Christ of Nazareth who raised the dead will change your life.

0:35:34.780,0:35:38.620
When you look at Him, you will see your life clearly.

0:35:38.620,0:35:47.400
May God Bless His Word.
