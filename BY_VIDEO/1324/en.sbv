0:00:00.000,0:00:01.560
Hallelujah

0:00:01.560,0:00:03.780
If I may call a brother there -

0:00:03.780,0:00:09.820
the brother that decided to abandon wife and children and leave home.

0:00:09.820,0:00:11.760
They didn’t know, you just abandoned home.

0:00:11.760,0:00:14.680
You left everything for them and ran for your dear life

0:00:14.680,0:00:21.600
because a ‘prophet’ or a ‘pastor’ told you that your wife was whatever you call her.

0:00:21.600,0:00:23.900
I will not join you to call your wife that.

0:00:23.900,0:00:29.980
Come out. You abandoned your wife and you are here today.

0:00:29.980,0:00:35.280
You abandoned your wife and your children at home – you are looking for ‘freedom’.

0:00:35.280,0:00:38.080
‘Your wife is the one in charge of this, your wife is the one who wants to kill you,

0:00:38.080,0:00:41.020
your wife is the one that made you jobless’ -

0:00:41.020,0:00:44.380
no, come and hear God’s opinion.

0:00:44.380,0:00:48.180
God loves you.

0:00:48.180,0:00:51.300
Give thanks to God.

0:00:51.300,0:00:55.420
Give thanks to Him.

0:00:55.420,0:00:58.460
My name is Godwin Ebhohimen.

0:00:58.460,0:01:04.380
I am the man the man of God prophesied about that has left his family.

0:01:04.380,0:01:07.680
I live in Abuja, doing business.

0:01:07.680,0:01:11.620
A pastor said my wife is the one bringing me down

0:01:11.620,0:01:17.760
because my business and everything went down the drain.

0:01:17.760,0:01:19.820
Even now, I am indebted.

0:01:19.820,0:01:22.520
Because of that, I decided to run away from them.

0:01:22.520,0:01:24.480
Nobody even knows where I am now.

0:01:24.480,0:01:27.360
I am the one the man of God prophesied about.

0:01:27.360,0:01:31.700
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:31.700,0:01:33.480
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:01:33.480,0:01:36.900
My name is Godwin Ebhohimen.

0:01:36.900,0:01:45.900
The woman standing right beside me is my lovely beautiful wife.

0:01:45.900,0:01:55.480
Last Sunday, I happened to be in The SCOAN where the man of God prophesied about a brother here

0:01:55.480,0:02:02.020
who had decided to abandon his home based on what he was told by a pastor

0:02:02.020,0:02:06.780
that his wife was responsible for his financial misfortunes.

0:02:06.780,0:02:10.120
He said I should come out and hear God’s opinion.

0:02:10.120,0:02:12.600
So, I came out.

0:02:12.600,0:02:18.220
Really, the prophecy is true.

0:02:18.220,0:02:23.020
In 2012, I was living in Abuja, doing my business.

0:02:23.020,0:02:29.620
I am into frozen foods, while my wife and children live in Edo State; she works there.

0:02:29.620,0:02:31.780
Every month, I visit them.

0:02:31.780,0:02:35.140
In 2012, customs seized my goods.

0:02:35.140,0:02:38.100
Early 2013, they seized more goods.

0:02:38.100,0:02:41.720
In 2013, we had our third baby.

0:02:41.720,0:02:44.260
We went to a church for the dedication.

0:02:44.260,0:02:53.920
During the dedication service, the pastor called my wife and both of our families

0:02:53.920,0:03:04.040
and told my wife that she was responsible for my downfall.

0:03:04.040,0:03:07.100
The families were crying and talking about it.

0:03:07.100,0:03:10.760
I told them to calm down.

0:03:10.760,0:03:13.700
He said my wife talked too much.

0:03:13.700,0:03:18.060
I told him that I knew the wife I married that she didn’t talk much or keep friends.

0:03:18.060,0:03:19.400
We went home.

0:03:19.400,0:03:21.820
The battle started.

0:03:21.820,0:03:24.040
In my home, there was no peace.

0:03:24.040,0:03:28.080
Any little thing that happened, I would recall the prophecy.

0:03:28.080,0:03:33.120
I quit my business because of financial problems and started another business.

0:03:33.120,0:03:35.920
That one – a car business also went down.

0:03:35.920,0:03:39.400
I went into property; that business also went down.

0:03:39.400,0:03:48.280
Any time I had financial difficulties, I would refer back to the message of that pastor

0:03:48.280,0:03:53.520
that my wife was responsible for my financial downfall.

0:03:53.520,0:04:00.320
It got to a point that even my children were sent out of school, the house rent was not paid

0:04:00.320,0:04:03.420
- so many problems.

0:04:03.420,0:04:07.560
Whenever I thought about that message, I would just take my bag and leave home.

0:04:07.560,0:04:12.700
It would be months before I returned home.

0:04:12.700,0:04:16.000
Mr Godwin Ebhohimen & Wife 
Prophecy Testimony

0:04:16.000,0:04:21.320
I had a property in Abuja that I decided to sell so that I could travel and leave this country.

0:04:21.320,0:04:26.700
I put it up for sale but nobody would buy it.

0:04:26.700,0:04:30.520
After going to three different agents, the property remained on the market.

0:04:30.520,0:04:35.520
Early this year, when we had a quarrel again and the children were sent out of school

0:04:35.520,0:04:39.500
and the landlord was disturbing us, I decided to leave for good,

0:04:39.500,0:04:43.780
to look for a way to sell the property and leave the country and live my life.

0:04:43.780,0:04:49.440
I left my wife and three kids.

0:04:49.440,0:04:53.820
I was in Ogun State and came to Ajah.

0:04:53.820,0:04:57.440
On Sunday, I came from Ajah to The SCOAN.

0:04:57.440,0:05:03.780
I decided that as I was leaving the country, I would change my sim card.

0:05:03.780,0:05:06.420
- No coming back to your wife...
- No coming...

0:05:06.420,0:05:08.080
When you finally came to the church - what happened?

0:05:08.080,0:05:15.520
When I came to the church, my aim was to get the Morning Water,

0:05:15.520,0:05:21.720
to sprinkle it on that property and see if God would give me the grace to sell the property and get out.

0:05:21.720,0:05:26.500
When I came here, I had the opportunity to get the Morning Water.

0:05:26.500,0:05:33.200
As soon as I got the Morning Water, I danced and felt happy that I would sell the property.

0:05:33.200,0:05:38.140
As I was dancing, I heard the man of God mention my case.

0:05:38.140,0:05:41.800
I was a bit reluctant but something pushed me and I came out.

0:05:41.800,0:05:46.340
The man of God gave the prophecy and I was asked to wait.

0:05:46.340,0:05:50.380
As I was waiting in the evening around six thirty something,

0:05:50.380,0:05:55.760
I received a phone call while I was in the church from one of the agents

0:05:55.760,0:06:00.160
stating that she had a buyer who wanted to negotiate for the same property

0:06:00.160,0:06:03.360
that nobody had called me about since last year.

0:06:03.360,0:06:13.140
When that call came, I said, “Wow, this is God who is in control. God is really here!”

0:06:13.140,0:06:15.000
We just want to ask you a question.

0:06:15.000,0:06:24.240
You said the message came forth and it pointed to your wife as the architect of your downfall.

0:06:24.240,0:06:26.380
Based on the fact that you were experiencing downfall,

0:06:26.380,0:06:31.300
you had to relate your misfortune in life to your wife.

0:06:31.300,0:06:34.660
That developed hatred and you abandoned her and the children.

0:06:34.660,0:06:37.680
Ever since you have abandoned her and the children, before you came to The SCOAN,

0:06:37.680,0:06:40.400
was your life really good?

0:06:40.400,0:06:45.580
Life was not good because so many people who I was owing were calling me, here and there.

0:06:45.580,0:06:47.300
At a point, I stopped wearing my wedding ring.

0:06:47.300,0:06:51.460
She would call me and ask where my wedding ring was.

0:06:51.460,0:06:55.320
I would tell her that ‘ring’ was not the problem, that it was the heart that was the problem,

0:06:55.320,0:06:58.540
so she shouldn’t care about the wedding ring.

0:06:58.540,0:07:00.520
Life was really miserable.

0:07:00.520,0:07:05.060
After the prophecy you received from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua telling you that

0:07:05.060,0:07:08.400
you are wrongly accusing your wife - what happened afterwards?

0:07:08.400,0:07:16.600
After that prophecy, I was waiting to see the man of God as he had directed when a call came in.

0:07:16.600,0:07:23.120
It was that call that really confirmed it to me - "Yes, this is God speaking."

0:07:23.120,0:07:32.940
When the call came in, I was happy that God had located me.

0:07:32.940,0:07:38.020
I called my wife to tell her where I was.

0:07:38.020,0:07:41.080
That same Sunday, she called me around 4pm when I was in church;

0:07:41.080,0:07:44.000
I told her not to worry, that I was safe and OK.

0:07:44.000,0:07:51.380
After the prophecy, on Monday morning, I called her and told her that I was in The SCOAN.

0:07:51.380,0:07:56.900
Before the prophecy, any time she called you, you didn't want to give her any attention,

0:07:56.900,0:07:58.920
because you still saw her as the architect of your problems?

0:07:58.920,0:07:59.560
Yes.

0:07:59.560,0:08:01.900
But after the prophecy, you intentionally gave her a call?

0:08:01.900,0:08:02.680
Yes.

0:08:02.680,0:08:04.660
Why did you have to call her after the prophecy?

0:08:04.660,0:08:10.280
Because I believe and confirm the prophecy is true.

0:08:10.280,0:08:17.220
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:08:17.220,0:08:23.880
Having heard from the man of God that you were wrongly accusing your wife and you were misinformed,

0:08:23.880,0:08:27.140
what is the state of your mind concerning your wife now?

0:08:27.140,0:08:31.300
Right now, she is the best woman on earth.

0:08:31.300,0:08:37.320
Immediately I called her, I went to search for where I had kept my ring and put it on

0:08:37.320,0:08:41.560
before seeing her face to face.

0:08:41.560,0:08:46.320
Once again, shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:08:46.320,0:08:48.880
What word do you have for your wife right now?

0:08:48.880,0:08:52.220
I have to beg her to please forgive me.

0:08:52.220,0:08:56.180
It was wrong information that was driving my heart.

0:08:56.180,0:09:02.040
Please, forgive me, my honey, my love.

0:09:02.040,0:09:08.680
That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:09:08.680,0:09:10.920
Right now, we want to hear from our madam.

0:09:10.920,0:09:16.560
We believe she is shedding tears of joy, because old things have passed away, all things have become new.

0:09:16.560,0:09:20.080
Right now, ma, to the glory of God and to the shame of the devil,

0:09:20.080,0:09:24.360
tell us your name, who is the man next to you and what you have to say about what your husband has said.

0:09:24.360,0:09:26.980
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:09:26.980,0:09:29.360
Good Morning everyone.

0:09:29.360,0:09:32.640
My name is Mrs Ebhohimen.

0:09:32.640,0:09:35.460
The man beside me is my husband.

0:09:35.460,0:09:38.080
We are from Edo State.

0:09:38.080,0:09:44.960
We got married in 2007 – November to be precise.

0:09:44.960,0:09:49.800
Within that time, our marriage was very sweet and loving.

0:09:49.800,0:09:57.880
It was not until 2012, when his business went down the drain.

0:09:57.880,0:10:03.120
In 2013, we had our third baby.

0:10:03.120,0:10:13.220
When we went for baby dedication in our local church, I invited friends; our relatives were there.

0:10:13.220,0:10:20.140
When it was time for the baby’s dedication, I carried my baby, right on the altar.

0:10:20.140,0:10:23.820
Everybody had followed me there to celebrate with me.

0:10:23.820,0:10:35.600
All of a sudden, the man of God told the whole church that he had an announcement to make - a prophecy.

0:10:35.600,0:10:46.520
He said, “This woman you are seeing here is the architect of her husband’s financial downfall”.

0:10:46.520,0:10:59.780
I stood there, speechless

0:10:59.780,0:11:03.280
waiting for my baby to be dedicated.

0:11:03.280,0:11:11.020
After the announcement he made, the dedication continued.

0:11:11.020,0:11:16.700
When we went home, things went the other way.

0:11:16.700,0:11:20.320
I saw another man in my husband.

0:11:20.320,0:11:24.540
I could no longer see my husband.

0:11:24.540,0:11:29.860
He no longer enjoyed my meals.

0:11:29.860,0:11:32.400
At the smallest quarrel,

0:11:32.400,0:11:39.100
he would ask me how was I sure that I was not the architect of his financial downfall.

0:11:39.100,0:11:44.240
Since then, life had not been easy for me.

0:11:44.240,0:11:46.100
At times, he would just leave the house.

0:11:46.100,0:11:50.600
On my return home from work, I would not meet him there.

0:11:50.600,0:11:58.380
He would not even speak a word or give a dime for the family upkeep.

0:11:58.380,0:12:07.900
Then, I had borrowed money from many people because he had left me and my children behind

0:12:07.900,0:12:11.300
and I was left alone to take care of my kids.

0:12:11.300,0:12:17.220
My salary was no longer enough for me to pay the debts I owed.

0:12:17.220,0:12:24.160
I continued borrowing to the extent that my salary was exhausted.

0:12:24.160,0:12:33.360
I would go out and buy food on credit to feed my children.

0:12:33.360,0:12:37.440
We strongly believe old things passed away, all things have become new.

0:12:37.440,0:12:40.340
Though it wasn't easy, but all to the glory of God.

0:12:40.340,0:12:44.620
This is the day the Lord has made and you will rejoice in it.

0:12:44.620,0:12:47.720
We strongly believe that you are only reflecting on a past issue,

0:12:47.720,0:12:53.300
knowing fully well that God has taken glory - restoration and reconciliation have come.

0:12:53.300,0:12:58.680
The vision is very clear now and to God be the glory.

0:12:58.680,0:13:11.940
My prayer then was for God to vindicate me and take away the garment of shame from my life.

0:13:11.940,0:13:17.440
On Monday last week, I had a phone call.

0:13:17.440,0:13:23.960
I was told the call was from The SCOAN, that my case was mentioned

0:13:23.960,0:13:28.980
and they wanted to see me here, on Saturday.

0:13:28.980,0:13:34.080
I left Edo State on Friday and came here yesterday.

0:13:34.080,0:13:37.700
I met my husband; they told me the prophecy.

0:13:37.700,0:13:45.980
I was so happy that at last I had been vindicated.

0:13:45.980,0:13:56.080
That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:13:56.080,0:13:57.440
To God be the glory.

0:13:57.440,0:14:03.640
It is a clear proof that when all hope is lost, Jesus Christ revives our hope.

0:14:03.640,0:14:06.780
No one is hopeless whose hope is in Christ Jesus.

0:14:06.780,0:14:13.640
Having received and honoured the call and meeting your husband, ever since then,

0:14:13.640,0:14:17.820
what are the changes you have noticed to confirm that the Lord has come to stay in this family?

0:14:17.820,0:14:26.360
The first change I noticed was his wedding ring because for a very long time, he had not put it on.

0:14:26.360,0:14:29.900
When I saw him yesterday, he was wearing the wedding ring

0:14:29.900,0:14:37.500
and I knew that God had restored my marriage.

0:14:37.500,0:14:41.400
To God be the glory.

0:14:41.400,0:14:45.940
Having gone through all this, right now you are vindicated.

0:14:45.940,0:14:50.460
As a woman, we believe you are in the best position to advise women out there.

0:14:50.460,0:14:54.260
If not for your patience, assuming you would have also taken a nasty step,

0:14:54.260,0:14:56.900
today there wouldn't have been anything like reconciliation.

0:14:56.900,0:15:00.760
You bore the situation, you were able to be patient, to persevere until today,

0:15:00.760,0:15:03.140
that the Lord has brought reconciliation to the family.

0:15:03.140,0:15:07.800
What word of advice do you have for women out there, how to handle issues like this?

0:15:07.800,0:15:11.420
It wasn’t easy for me as a woman.

0:15:11.420,0:15:15.980
It was the grace of God that kept me in the marriage ‘til today.

0:15:15.980,0:15:20.940
A day came when he told me he was tired of me and that I should leave.

0:15:20.940,0:15:29.720
I told him that I was not leaving the home because God said the two become one,

0:15:29.720,0:15:33.820
that we did our wedding in the church and I would never leave him.

0:15:33.820,0:15:37.660
I told him wherever he went, he must come back.

0:15:37.660,0:15:41.320
This has been the faith that has been keeping me.

0:15:41.320,0:15:48.840
My advice to my fellow women out there that have been blacklisted and called ‘witch’,

0:15:48.840,0:15:53.940
I want to advise you that there is nothing the Lord cannot do.

0:15:53.940,0:15:58.880
The Most High who has used our Prophet T.B. Joshua to vindicate me,

0:15:58.880,0:16:03.240
will visit you, in the name of Jesus.

0:16:03.240,0:16:07.760
To God be the glory. Our belief is that they have keyed into this advice.

0:16:07.760,0:16:12.080
We believe this advice will go a long way to bring a reconciliation to many families,

0:16:12.080,0:16:14.680
and give hope to women out there, who are facing similar situations,

0:16:14.680,0:16:17.280
as the Lord has taken control in your life.

0:16:17.280,0:16:22.800
Let's hear briefly from your husband.

0:16:22.800,0:16:28.020
With all said and done, we believe you are convinced that the Lord is good.

0:16:28.020,0:16:32.220
What word of advice you have for men out there?

0:16:32.220,0:16:42.960
My advice to the whole world is that whatsoever the situation, difficulty

0:16:42.960,0:16:52.560
or name they call our partner, loved one or people around you, don’t be in a haste to act.

0:16:52.560,0:16:57.780
Search for the mind of God towards that thing that is happening.

0:16:57.780,0:17:04.200
God would surely provide an answer, in Jesus’ name.

0:17:04.200,0:17:05.520
To God be the glory.

0:17:05.520,0:17:11.940
You heard it all; when you are in a haste to achieve something, you are likely to make a costly mistake,

0:17:11.940,0:17:14.400
that will pull you back if not down.

0:17:14.400,0:17:19.460
Having harkened to this word of advice, we also want to encourage you as a couple

0:17:19.460,0:17:24.200
having known that the Lord is good, and your coming together is for good, for better or worse,

0:17:24.200,0:17:28.720
if you go and maintain your relationship in Christ Jesus,

0:17:28.720,0:17:34.200
always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.

0:17:34.200,0:17:36.880
Let's clap for Jesus Christ.

0:17:36.880,0:17:43.100
Shortly afterwards, Mr & Mrs Godwin came back to The SCOAN

0:17:43.100,0:17:46.960
to testify to the goodness of God in their marriage.

0:17:46.960,0:17:48.600
Let’s listen to them.

0:17:48.600,0:17:52.420
My name is Godwin Ebhohimen.

0:17:52.420,0:18:00.620
I am the man the prophet prophesied about who abandoned his wife and children.

0:18:00.620,0:18:05.360
I give God the glory for locating me in that wonderful service.

0:18:05.360,0:18:11.980
Since that prophecy came, God has really changed my life.

0:18:11.980,0:18:19.460
I thank God that my family, my wife and I have been reconciled.

0:18:19.460,0:18:27.560
The love of God has started growing in our lives and I believe God that this reconciliation

0:18:27.560,0:18:37.180
that God used the man of God to bring to our lives is going to be permanent ‘til death do us apart.

0:18:37.180,0:18:44.660
I thank God today that God in His infinite mercy looked upon me and my family.

0:18:44.660,0:18:49.660
There have been great changes since this prophecy came to me.

0:18:49.660,0:18:51.720
I thank God for this prophecy.

0:18:51.720,0:18:57.940
I can see happiness, God’s love and unity.

0:18:57.940,0:19:02.700
We discuss things we didn’t discuss before.

0:19:02.700,0:19:06.380
Those are some of the changes I have started to experience.

0:19:06.380,0:19:07.340
Glory be to Jesus Christ.

0:19:07.340,0:19:09.720
We thank God for what He has done in your life.

0:19:09.720,0:19:12.340
Tell us what is the way forward from here.

0:19:12.340,0:19:16.840
The way forward from here is for me to commit myself to God the more.

0:19:16.840,0:19:23.340
I pray God will give me the grace to serve Him in humility, righteousness and faithfulness.

0:19:23.340,0:19:24.440
Thank you very much.

0:19:24.440,0:19:28.300
We want to hear a word from your wife as well.

0:19:28.300,0:19:29.920
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:19:29.920,0:19:33.240
My name is Mrs Ebhohimen.

0:19:33.240,0:19:36.940
The man beside me is my lovely husband.

0:19:36.940,0:19:43.160
I came to The SCOAN through a call from the man of God, here,

0:19:43.160,0:19:47.180
that my case was mentioned here in a Sunday service.

0:19:47.180,0:19:52.040
Since the reconciliation, I have seen love like never before.

0:19:52.040,0:19:54.280
There is peace and joy now.

0:19:54.280,0:20:00.260
Anything my husband thinks in his heart, he will tell me, which he didn’t use to do before.

0:20:00.260,0:20:01.860
I give God the glory.

0:20:01.860,0:20:03.360
Glory be to Jesus Christ.

0:20:03.360,0:20:05.300
We thank God for this beautiful reconciliation,

0:20:05.300,0:20:09.380
that God Almighty has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to perform in this marriage.

0:20:09.380,0:20:13.780
As you are here, and you are going back to your destination,

0:20:13.780,0:20:21.480
Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners have sent us to you with a cash gift of 100,000 Naira,

0:20:21.480,0:20:27.700
for your upkeep, future plans and endeavours, in order to support you,

0:20:27.700,0:20:31.580
to be able to succeed in whatever you want to achieve in life.

0:20:31.580,0:20:38.840
With it you also have one Mirror book for your spiritual growth.

0:20:38.840,0:20:41.340
I am shocked and overwhelmed.

0:20:41.340,0:20:47.120
I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners for this wonderful gift.

0:20:47.120,0:20:49.920
It is God’s grace for me to receive this.

0:20:49.920,0:20:55.820
I thank the Emmanuel TV partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:55.820,0:20:57.500
May God increase them.

0:20:57.500,0:21:03.900
May God increase his family, his ministry and his anointing, in Jesus' name.

0:21:03.900,0:21:07.220
Amen, glory be to Jesus Christ for what He has done in your life.

0:21:07.220,0:21:12.440
We know that this cash gift will go a way, in order to strengthen this family

0:21:12.440,0:21:17.980
and to make sure that you will be able to establish your family and your house in a right way,

0:21:17.980,0:21:18.920
for the glory of God.

0:21:18.920,0:21:21.440
We also want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your life,

0:21:21.440,0:21:26.760
so that everything you received here shall be permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:21:26.760,0:21:27.900
Amen.

0:21:27.900,0:21:32.000
Thank You, Jesus!
