0:00:00.200,0:00:05.920
If the way you pray is the same way I do pray,

0:00:05.920,0:00:09.740
my prayer would not answer.

0:00:09.740,0:00:13.380
Look, let me tell you a few words about prayer.

0:00:13.380,0:00:16.820
When you see me stretching my hand to pray for you,

0:00:16.820,0:00:20.300
that is not just the beginning.

0:00:20.300,0:00:30.480
I consider where I am coming from before I pray.

0:00:30.480,0:00:37.660
I must have been in an attitude of prayer before I say, "Be healed".

0:00:37.660,0:00:41.420
If I'm not in an attitude of prayer, in the realm of prayer,

0:00:41.420,0:00:44.660
I cannot say, "Be healed!"

0:00:44.660,0:00:47.200
Whom am I going to call when I'm not in the realm of prayer?

0:00:47.200,0:00:51.460
Jesus is in the realm of prayer; that is why He answers prayer.

0:00:51.460,0:00:54.040
When you are not in that realm of prayer and you are praying,

0:00:54.040,0:00:56.960
whom are you calling, whom are you talking to?

0:00:56.960,0:00:59.720
You are talking to yourself; you must be in the realm.

0:00:59.720,0:01:04.740
You can't stand here and begin to call somebody in Oshodi (Nigeria).

0:01:04.740,0:01:08.040
You must be in Oshodi (Nigeria) to call the person in Oshodi.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:16.400,0:01:17.900
Are you with me?

0:01:17.900,0:01:22.240
You can't stand here and begin to call someone in London (UK),

0:01:22.240,0:01:24.500
without being in London.

0:01:24.500,0:01:27.420
I mean, without any technology, using your mouth.

0:01:27.420,0:01:29.840
You cannot use your handset and begin to pray;

0:01:29.840,0:01:33.180
you want to use your handset to call Jesus. No!

0:01:33.180,0:01:37.340
It is not possible. You must get there and call the person.

0:01:37.340,0:01:41.160
It is meditation that takes us to Him.

0:01:41.160,0:01:43.760
When we get to Him, we pray.

0:01:43.760,0:01:47.280
But you don't meditate and you pray.

0:01:47.280,0:01:51.060
It is meditation that carries us to Jesus.

0:01:51.060,0:01:53.060
It carries us to Jesus. Look at the fruit.

0:01:53.060,0:01:54.740
Can you see the fruit here?

0:01:54.740,0:01:59.140
It is not possible for me here to take the fruit.

0:01:59.140,0:02:05.040
My hand is not that long; I cannot get any fruit.

0:02:05.040,0:02:07.320
I must get there to get the fruit.

0:02:07.320,0:02:10.240
To get there, it is by meditation.

0:02:10.240,0:02:14.420
Meditation will take me to the fruit.

0:02:14.420,0:02:16.440
And when I get there, I will now...

0:02:16.440,0:02:20.620
Prayer is ask, you shall be given; knock, it shall be opened.

0:02:20.620,0:02:22.620
That is prayer.

0:02:22.620,0:02:28.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:28.960,0:02:32.380
Now, the picture of your life is:

0:02:32.380,0:02:36.700
You are here and you asking for fruit; you want fruit.

0:02:36.700,0:02:40.680
"I want fruit, I want fruit" - who will give you the fruit? You cannot...

0:02:40.680,0:02:44.020
Look at it - you are far from the fruit.

0:02:44.020,0:02:49.840
Meditation removes the obstacles and takes you there.

0:02:49.840,0:02:58.480
It takes you to the realm of prayer - meditation.

0:02:58.480,0:03:06.560
This is why we say: Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.

0:03:06.560,0:03:07.500
Tell you neighbour.

0:03:07.500,0:03:15.420
Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.

0:03:15.420,0:03:16.600
I can't hear you.

0:03:16.600,0:03:19.920
Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.

0:03:19.920,0:03:21.920
Yes.

0:03:21.920,0:03:27.900
What are we meditating? God's Word.

0:03:27.900,0:03:31.760
Do you know that something is greater than all what you are waiting for?

0:03:31.760,0:03:49.120
Hearing from God is a much greater blessing than

0:03:49.120,0:03:51.920
any of the blessings you are waiting for.

0:03:51.920,0:03:54.340
To hear. You know when you hear from God,

0:03:54.340,0:03:58.200
you will know whether what you are asking for is the right thing to receive.

0:03:58.200,0:04:00.900
When you hear from God, you will know when to leave here.

0:04:00.900,0:04:04.220
When you hear from God, you will know who is talking to you.

0:04:04.220,0:04:07.840
When you hear from God, you will know when to go to work.

0:04:07.840,0:04:16.420
All this trouble that is happening all over the world - people don't hear from God.

0:04:16.420,0:04:23.820
Hearing from God while praying is a much greater blessing

0:04:23.820,0:04:31.580
than any blessing you are seeking - healing...

0:04:31.580,0:04:33.500
Hearing from God.

0:04:33.500,0:04:38.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:38.760,0:04:43.980
You are ignorant of things of God.

0:04:43.980,0:04:47.760
You see God as one of those things

0:04:47.760,0:04:51.740
and God is not one of those things. He is...

0:04:51.740,0:04:58.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:58.640,0:05:07.120
Don't wait until your last day before you know God; you have to know God.

0:05:07.120,0:05:16.500
Because you have wasted so many years and time.

0:05:16.500,0:05:19.280
If you knew the plan of God for your life,

0:05:19.280,0:05:24.720
you would be crying, "Ha, this is the plan of God for my life".

0:05:24.720,0:05:34.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:34.900,0:05:44.920
A break in prayer is a break in God.

0:05:44.920,0:05:51.420
You should be ready at any time.

0:05:51.420,0:05:57.780
It is not when the situation is at hand, you pray.

0:05:57.780,0:06:02.960
You should always be in an attitude of prayer.

0:06:02.960,0:06:05.260
What is now going on in your heart?

0:06:05.260,0:06:10.460
If you don't engage your heart, something else will take over your heart.

0:06:10.460,0:06:13.720
Right now, begin to engage your heart.

0:06:13.720,0:06:21.080
The heart cannot be neutral; it must say something.

0:06:21.080,0:06:27.280
You must take hold of your heart so that your past will not take hold of your heart -

0:06:27.280,0:06:33.480
where you are coming from, your situation.

0:06:33.480,0:06:41.280
Take hold of your heart; Jesus loves you.

0:06:41.280,0:06:47.300
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
