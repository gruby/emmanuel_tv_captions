0:00:02.060,0:00:15.600
Well let me wish you, Happy Wonderful Year

0:00:15.600,0:00:20.540
Good morning

0:00:20.540,0:00:24.960
Viewers all over the world,

0:00:24.960,0:00:27.020
Happy Wonderful New Year

0:00:27.020,0:00:34.500
I call it a wonderful year because it's a wonderful year.

0:00:34.500,0:00:39.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:39.200,0:00:41.500
Thank you

0:00:41.500,0:00:45.360
This year is a wonderful year.

0:00:45.360,0:00:54.460
I know many nations have not yet entered the new year

0:00:54.460,0:01:00.000
but I want to tell you what you are about to enter, or what you have entered

0:01:00.000,0:01:02.060
is a wonderful one.

0:01:02.060,0:01:03.240
Amen!!!

0:01:03.240,0:01:07.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:07.860,0:01:12.560
And those nations that have a different calendar.

0:01:12.560,0:01:19.040
But in all, 2017 is a wonderful year.

0:01:19.040,0:01:20.180
Amen!!!

0:01:24.440,0:01:29.720
And it's so wonderful for you, people of God.

0:01:29.720,0:01:38.520
After going through the whole thing -

0:01:38.520,0:01:44.180
the revelation and what we should be expecting in the year -

0:01:44.180,0:01:47.020
you will agree with me so wonderful.

0:01:47.020,0:01:49.520
I don't know how to call it.

0:01:49.520,0:01:56.700
Will i call it new year or new beginning or whatever but I chose the word wonderful.

0:01:56.700,0:02:00.040
Because it's so wonderful.

0:02:00.040,0:02:06.420
It demands trust and obey.

0:02:06.420,0:02:11.200
The year demands trust and obey.

0:02:11.200,0:02:19.820
That's why I said it is wonderful: It's a wonderful year because of what it demands.

0:02:19.820,0:02:30.940
If you want to go through the year, enjoy the year, overcome and walk through it smoothly,

0:02:30.940,0:02:35.980
just trust and obey.

0:02:35.980,0:02:40.080
That is why I call it a wonderful year.

0:02:40.080,0:02:57.760
This year we will experience challenges and some of these  challenges are going to be unique.

0:02:57.760,0:03:04.880
When something is unique, there are  things that you will not know how to handle

0:03:04.880,0:03:07.700
because you have never gone through them before.

0:03:07.700,0:03:10.920
There are not things you can handle.

0:03:10.920,0:03:17.060
When things you can handle come, you can say, "Yes, let me apply the former tactic,

0:03:17.060,0:03:20.000
the strategy I used in the past".

0:03:20.000,0:03:29.720
But for the one that is unique, you will say, "Ah, I don't know how to go about this".

0:03:29.720,0:03:42.840
A lot of these challenges will be very unique - different from what you know and are used to.

0:03:42.840,0:03:58.000
Remember yesterday I told you that no matter the challenges, they will not impair you but improve you -

0:03:58.000,0:04:03.740
just trust and obey.

0:04:03.740,0:04:18.780
The reason why there will be so many challenges and unique ones is because there is a dream for you.

0:04:18.780,0:04:24.980
Today, take my word, you have a dream.

0:04:24.980,0:04:29.640
Tell your neighbor: "I have a dream".

0:04:29.640,0:04:38.040
A dream is something that you may not know but people can tell you, "You have a dream".

0:04:38.040,0:04:45.300
You say what is the dream?

0:04:45.300,0:04:56.180
This year will come with so many challenges and unique ones because you have a dream.

0:04:56.180,0:05:01.920
There is something the Lord said to me that I should tell you -

0:05:01.920,0:05:06.500
the voice of their wailing shall be silenced.

0:05:06.500,0:05:07.780
Amen!!

0:05:09.900,0:05:19.240
That is - tell your people the voice of their wailing will be silenced.

0:05:19.240,0:05:25.800
This means that God is there to intervene and to rescue you.

0:05:25.800,0:05:41.680
The outcome of this is a dream - dream of breakthrough - the outcome of challenges.

0:05:41.680,0:05:49.340
You have nothing to worry about - just trust and obey

0:05:49.340,0:05:55.100
The Lord says, the voice of trouble shall be silenced.

0:05:55.100,0:05:56.800
What else again?

0:05:56.800,0:06:00.400
The voice of difficulty shall be silenced.

0:06:00.400,0:06:04.380
Setback, hardship, just name them, shall be silenced.

0:06:04.380,0:06:12.460
It means these will come; you will only hear the crying but they will not reach you.

0:06:12.460,0:06:14.440
Amen!!

0:06:18.780,0:06:30.640
Voice means strength - their strength, their ability to destroy you, to kill you will be combated.

0:06:30.640,0:06:34.640
Just trust and obey

0:06:34.640,0:06:46.320
Tell your neighbour, "Just trust and obey".

0:06:46.320,0:06:54.820
Those dreams, you thought were lost, they are not lost.

0:06:54.820,0:06:59.320
There are a lot of dreams you had in the past and you keep asking yourself -

0:06:59.320,0:07:06.000
I dreamt I gave a handshake to this man three years ago but I have never met the man until now.

0:07:06.000,0:07:11.580
There are lot of question you keep asking yourself, no  one to answer.

0:07:11.580,0:07:16.220
Those dreams are not lost.

0:07:16.220,0:07:18.220
Amen!!

0:07:20.340,0:07:29.600
This year, dream of breakthrough - a new dream for you (Amen!!!)

0:07:29.600,0:07:31.960
Write it down, write it down.

0:07:31.960,0:07:38.240
I am just giving you the summary of what is here.

0:07:38.240,0:07:46.800
Dream of breakthrough (Amen!!) - a new dream for you (Amen).

0:07:46.800,0:07:50.800
Just trust and obey.

0:07:50.800,0:07:59.760
Amidst trouble, that is in the midst of challenges you will find yourself in.

0:07:59.760,0:08:12.480
But the Lord says, "The voice of challenges shall be silenced!" (Amen)

0:08:12.480,0:08:20.180
The outcome of the temptation and difficult circumstances you will be going through,

0:08:20.180,0:08:25.040
the outcome of unique challenges you will be going through -

0:08:25.040,0:08:31.080
dream of breakthrough, a new dream for you.

0:08:31.080,0:08:33.080
Amen!!!

0:08:33.080,0:08:35.820
Dream of prosperity, a new dream for you.

0:08:35.820,0:08:37.160
Amen!!!

0:08:37.160,0:08:40.720
Are you writing it down?

0:08:40.720,0:08:46.400
These are the dreams you were supposed to have yourself but you could not,

0:08:46.400,0:08:51.360
but I had a dream and I am now telling you what I dreamt about you.

0:08:51.360,0:08:57.620
If you now doubt my dream, definitely there is no cause for you to come here.

0:08:57.620,0:09:04.020
Can somebody come out and tell me what dream you had about yourself concerning this new approach.

0:09:04.020,0:09:07.000
You are saying Happy New Year without a dream.

0:09:07.000,0:09:09.220
How come?

0:09:09.220,0:09:15.660
How do you know you are in a new beginning? How do you know?

0:09:15.660,0:09:23.440
Oh no, this is intellectual property, anyway.

0:09:23.440,0:09:25.580
You say it's a slogan.

0:09:25.580,0:09:28.700
It's not a slogan, it has to do with your life.

0:09:28.800,0:09:31.920
If you say "New Year - new beginning", you should believe it.

0:09:31.920,0:09:34.220
Your soul and spirit should believe it.

0:09:34.220,0:09:38.100
When your soul believes it, then it works for you.

0:09:38.100,0:09:40.100
It's not a slogan.

0:09:40.100,0:09:48.560
Talk to me, how do you know you are in a new beginning, a new year?

0:09:48.560,0:09:50.100
Praise the Lord.

0:09:50.100,0:09:57.300
You know that you are in a new year when you have a change in mind, change of mind, change of position.

0:09:57.300,0:10:01.560
Wanting to do things differently from how you used to do them before.

0:10:01.560,0:10:06.760
As soon as you have this feeling, you believe it, you begin to do things in that new way.

0:10:06.760,0:10:12.700
That makes you a new person, a new creature, not just a change in calendar

0:10:12.700,0:10:15.780
but change in position and change in what you believe in.

0:10:15.780,0:10:17.380
To a new thing.

0:10:17.380,0:10:18.400
Thank you!

0:10:18.400,0:10:21.480
Can we believe this is what you read?

0:10:21.480,0:10:23.600
Or is this what you believe?

0:10:23.600,0:10:25.600
I have never read it but I believe it.

0:10:25.600,0:10:26.340
You believe it?

0:10:26.340,0:10:28.460
I believe it.

0:10:28.460,0:10:33.760
Ok. Tell us those things that you have changed to start the new year.

0:10:33.760,0:10:37.260
Well basically I am business man.

0:10:40.680,0:10:43.120
Can you see where this man started from?

0:10:43.120,0:10:44.380
Sit down, sit down.

0:10:44.380,0:10:48.160
I know. I know you people.

0:10:48.160,0:10:53.640
First - money!

0:10:53.640,0:11:02.440
Well, you begin a New Year when you finally discover that everything you don't want

0:11:02.440,0:11:11.620
and you don't like - unfavourable situations - end with the year.

0:11:11.620,0:11:21.180
Ask your neighbour: "What are the unfavourable situations that have ended with the year 2016?"

0:11:21.180,0:11:23.180
Ask your neighbour.

0:11:23.180,0:11:31.860
What are those unfavourable situations you have been in that have ended with that year?

0:11:31.860,0:11:35.360
Carry over is not good.

0:11:35.360,0:11:39.620
You were fighting yesterday and you wake up. The fight continues.

0:11:39.620,0:11:44.300
"Happy New Year 2017" - the fight continues.

0:11:44.300,0:11:52.800
You have not began a new year, you are still 2016.

0:11:52.800,0:12:03.020
Every unfavourable situation you have been in, must end with the outgoing year.

0:12:03.020,0:12:05.020
Amen!!

0:12:05.020,0:12:08.260
That is how we know.

0:12:08.260,0:12:15.360
The way you were thinking yesterday, is the same way you are thinking now.

0:12:15.360,0:12:19.860
The same way you approached things yesterday is the same way you are approaching things now.

0:12:19.860,0:12:24.500
What is new then?

0:12:24.500,0:12:41.940
The same anger, pain, envy, jealousy, offense, bitterness, strife - those qualities are still there.

0:12:41.940,0:12:44.440
It's not too late now.

0:12:44.440,0:12:52.460
We are in the house of God right at beginning of the year - what a wonderful year!

0:12:52.460,0:12:54.460
This is why I call it wonderful year.

0:12:54.460,0:12:58.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:58.040,0:13:09.080
Let me tell you something. Assume this year did not start on a Sunday like last year.

0:13:09.080,0:13:15.260
You know where you were last year. You were with friends.

0:13:15.260,0:13:26.000
1st of January is a time, season to visit friends, go for tours which is opposite to where we are now.

0:13:26.000,0:13:28.560
Look at where you find yourself.

0:13:28.560,0:13:32.320
The approach you give to this year is so wonderful -

0:13:32.320,0:13:40.500
the best approach one can give is to trust and obey.

0:13:41.000,0:13:50.120
This is why we are here today and it is not too late to settle our accounts, 1st of January.

0:13:50.120,0:13:51.240
Are you ready?

0:13:51.240,0:13:52.520
Yes!!

0:13:52.520,0:13:55.760
That has to do with your heart.

0:13:55.760,0:14:05.340
Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall settle their accounts.

0:14:05.340,0:14:06.160
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:06.160,0:14:14.200
Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall settle their accounts.

0:14:14.200,0:14:24.260
That is, you will see God, you will have a new beginning, you will have a new dream.

0:14:24.260,0:14:32.000
I want to take you back again, the revelation I have for you. Are you ready to listen now?

0:14:32.000,0:14:37.800
Just listen and write it down.

0:14:37.800,0:14:46.020
I was in a vision and the Lord gave me a dream for you.

0:14:46.020,0:14:47.560
Amen!!!

0:14:47.560,0:14:51.660
You may exclude yourself, you may include yourself

0:14:51.660,0:14:55.740
It is a matter of faith.

0:14:55.740,0:14:58.980
You can say, "Yes! This man is talking to me";

0:14:58.980,0:15:01.920
"No, this man is not talking to me".

0:15:01.920,0:15:06.040
It is a matter of choice.

0:15:06.040,0:15:21.740
The Lord revealed to me that this year will come with unique challenges, so many challenges.

0:15:21.740,0:15:29.880
Tell your people they should believe and trust;

0:15:29.880,0:15:33.500
just trust and obey.

0:15:33.500,0:15:35.640
Are you writting it?

0:15:35.640,0:15:42.480
Just trust and obey.

0:15:42.480,0:15:48.460
The Lord said, "Remember I am the Father of dreams".

0:15:48.460,0:15:51.820
He said He is the Father of dreams.

0:15:51.820,0:15:56.760
He started telling me some of the people He had given dreams:

0:15:56.940,0:16:00.060
"I am sending you to your people, give them this dream".

0:16:00.060,0:16:06.840
He said He gave a dream to Abraham,

0:16:06.840,0:16:10.180
a dream to Daniel,

0:16:10.180,0:16:12.820
a dream to Joseph,

0:16:12.820,0:16:17.000
a dream to Peter and I woke up.

0:16:17.000,0:16:21.300
When I woke up, I said what is this?

0:16:21.300,0:16:25.820
I realized that this is a voice from Heaven.

0:16:25.820,0:16:31.000
The vision continued.

0:16:31.000,0:16:40.280
Here are dreams - dream of walking with the Lord, a new dream for you.

0:16:40.280,0:16:42.260
Whether you like it or not,

0:16:42.260,0:16:46.520
This year ...

0:16:46.520,0:16:50.380
Don't just delay. Something will propel you.

0:16:50.380,0:17:01.480
The unique challenges - you will know yourself that no witch doctor can help you with those.

0:17:01.480,0:17:07.160
No fake people, spiritualist or what ever can help you.

0:17:07.160,0:17:12.320
You will know yourself,  you will be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that nobody can help me.

0:17:12.320,0:17:14.560
Let me run to God.

0:17:14.560,0:17:21.820
You will run a proper run to God this year.

0:17:21.820,0:17:25.980
Ah! Ok.

0:17:25.980,0:17:35.700
There will be a force you cannot resist.

0:17:35.700,0:17:40.220
Dream of walking with the Lord - a new dream for you.

0:17:40.220,0:17:41.360
Tell your Neighbour.

0:17:41.360,0:17:56.260
Dream of walking with the Lord - a new dream for you this year, 2017.

0:17:56.260,0:18:01.140
You have not started, when you leave here you will see what will be happening in your life.

0:18:01.140,0:18:07.300
Amen!!!

0:18:07.300,0:18:12.220
By the time you leave here, you will start seeing a force you cannot resist.

0:18:12.220,0:18:21.060
You want to pray the more and fast the more.    (Amen!!!!)

0:18:21.060,0:18:32.400
The more the attack, the more you pray and fast this year.

0:18:32.400,0:18:40.480
You have been serving God in the past intellectually, that is how you serve God.

0:18:40.480,0:18:44.520
That will not work this year.

0:18:44.520,0:18:55.120
You will serve God with all your heart this year. That is a new dream for you.

0:18:55.120,0:19:03.360
The more the challenges, the more your desire for God this year.

0:19:03.360,0:19:07.620
So, the challenges we are talking about are a blessing.

0:19:07.620,0:19:10.980
Tell your neighbour, "It's a blessing then".

0:19:10.980,0:19:15.320
Whatever challenges T.B. Joshua is talking about are a blessing

0:19:15.320,0:19:19.400
because the more the challenges, the more my desire for God.

0:19:19.400,0:19:24.220
It's a blessing. Let it come! I want to draw closer to God.

0:19:24.220,0:19:35.480
If that will draw me closer to God, it's a blessing.

0:19:35.480,0:19:40.800
So, now, there is no cause for fear.

0:19:40.800,0:19:49.520
Before now, when challenges came in the past, 2016, you ran about, running to spiritualist.

0:19:49.520,0:19:55.640
Running to this, running to that, spending money. Being afraid!!

0:19:55.640,0:20:02.900
Running from God, instead of running to God.

0:20:02.900,0:20:06.160
It's a good year.

0:20:06.160,0:20:11.180
I know you are asking yourself: How will it happen? How will my desire for God happen?

0:20:11.180,0:20:14.540
Because when trouble comes, you always panic!

0:20:14.540,0:20:18.460
You panic and ask yourself, "How will I get out of this trouble?"

0:20:18.460,0:20:20.460
Rejoice!!

0:20:20.460,0:20:23.080
This Year.

0:20:23.080,0:20:26.700
I don't know how it will happen.

0:20:26.700,0:20:34.620
The vision I saw for you, number ONE -

0:20:34.620,0:20:45.720
a dream of walking with the Lord, a new dream for you.

0:20:45.720,0:20:57.640
A new dream has come. Happy New Year!!

0:20:57.640,0:21:03.880
Nothing and nothing will stop you from the love of God this year.

0:21:03.880,0:21:08.200
No challenges will stop you from the love of God.

0:21:08.200,0:21:13.160
No difficult circumstances can stop you from the love of God.

0:21:13.160,0:21:17.100
No infirmity will stop you from the love of God.

0:21:17.100,0:21:22.380
The more they come, the more your desire for God, in Jesus' name.

0:21:22.380,0:21:30.400
Stand up and give thanks to God!

0:21:30.400,0:21:35.860
The aim and objective of satan is to separate you.

0:21:35.860,0:21:41.480
He uses challenges and difficult circumstances to separate you,

0:21:41.480,0:21:48.920
to bring you into sin, to confess sin. This is just the aim of satan.

0:21:48.920,0:21:55.480
But his aim has been defeated! The more they come, the more your desire.

0:21:55.480,0:22:06.060
The more the challenges, trouble, sickness, infirmity, just name those things satan can bring -

0:22:06.060,0:22:12.120
the more they come, the more your desire and determination for God.

0:22:12.120,0:22:16.280
His aim has been defeated.

0:22:16.280,0:22:24.700
Be strong; trust Him. That is the key to begin this year.

0:22:24.700,0:22:29.120
When I had this vision, I was happy!

0:22:29.120,0:22:33.440
Immediately I stood up and I said, "Lord, thank you!!"

0:22:33.440,0:22:39.820
This is what I have been praying for, this is what has been rescuing me.

0:22:39.820,0:22:45.040
This is the tactic and strategy that has been protecting me.

0:22:45.040,0:22:49.460
The more these people come, the more my desire.

0:22:49.460,0:22:53.700
The more these people attack, the more my desire and determination.

0:22:53.700,0:23:01.040
The more they hate me, speak bad about me, the more my desire and my determination.

0:23:01.040,0:23:03.920
This has been protecting me.

0:23:12.320,0:23:19.240
When satan realizes that the more he attacks you, the more your desire for God, he will leave you.

0:23:22.480,0:23:26.520
At the beginning of this year, it may be a bit rough.

0:23:26.520,0:23:32.920
But when satan realizes that he cannot separate you with challenges ...

0:23:32.920,0:23:40.080
No matter the sickness, difficult circumstances, this person will not deny God.

0:23:40.080,0:23:50.760
Look at what happened to Job. The more I afflicted this person, the more he loves Jesus.

0:23:58.720,0:24:05.040
But the moment satan realizes that when he hits, you look back ...

0:24:05.040,0:24:10.980
It's not possible to look back and answer your enemy and at the same time continue the journey.

0:24:10.980,0:24:14.700
What are you saying?

0:24:14.700,0:24:17.280
Where are you going then?

0:24:17.280,0:24:19.740
Where am I going now?

0:24:19.740,0:24:23.180
I go nowhere. That is the journey you have been walking with the Lord.

0:24:23.180,0:24:26.480
That is your journey with the Lord.

0:24:26.480,0:24:30.220
Come brother, let me give you an example of what I am talking about!

0:24:30.220,0:24:32.960
This is God. Stand here.

0:24:35.140,0:24:38.760
I don't want to use anybody for satan.

0:24:38.760,0:24:43.900
I don't want to. We are in a new year.

0:24:43.900,0:24:54.100
Satan stands here, can you see?

0:24:54.100,0:24:55.800
Here is this foolish man.

0:24:57.820,0:25:06.500
Here you. You represent T.B. Joshua and this is God where you are going towards to.

0:25:06.500,0:25:12.500
On your way to God, satan will hit you.

0:25:12.500,0:25:25.100
When he hits you, it is either with disappointment, failure, setback, sickness or with something else.

0:25:25.100,0:25:28.500
He can't just hit you without those things like nightmare.

0:25:28.500,0:25:35.100
You are just going and satan just hits you. And when he hits you, you say, "Aha".

0:25:35.100,0:25:42.500
Then you cannot see where you are going. This is where you will be concentrating.

0:25:42.500,0:25:48.500
This is where you are going. Can you see where I am going now?

0:25:48.500,0:25:53.400
That is the journey you have been embarking on.

0:25:53.400,0:26:04.280
And his interest is to cause you your position,

0:26:04.280,0:26:14.240
to overthrow you and to cause you setbacks and limitations.

0:26:14.240,0:26:16.920
You see where I am going. Instead of going straight to God.

0:26:16.920,0:26:19.800
You will not be able to run a straight race.

0:26:19.800,0:26:30.800
Now, here satan hits me whilst I, T.B. Joshua, are on the journey I have been embarking on.

0:26:30.800,0:26:39.040
I will be talking, praying to fight satan but I will not look back.

0:26:39.040,0:26:47.800
I am fighting but I continue my journey.

0:26:47.800,0:26:55.400
That is why you are here today. If this journey had not been a straight race,

0:26:55.400,0:27:01.000
you would not be here today.

0:27:01.000,0:27:06.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:06.700,0:27:09.940
You would not be here today.

0:27:09.940,0:27:15.000
Your business has not been a straight race.

0:27:15.000,0:27:19.400
Your finances have not been a straight race.

0:27:19.440,0:27:23.600
Your marriage has not been a straight race.

0:27:23.600,0:27:26.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:26.800,0:27:34.200
This is why you have to run a straight race.

0:27:34.200,0:27:40.000
The more satan hits you, the more you should speed up your spiritual walk.

0:27:40.000,0:27:46.000
A hit of satan is like you are climbing a hill with a bike.

0:27:46.000,0:27:52.800
When you are climbing a hill with a bike, you put it on a small gear so that it can move.

0:27:52.800,0:27:57.400
The more you are hit with either sickness or disease does not make you a child of satan.

0:27:57.400,0:28:05.800
You can be sick in body and yet be a child of God. Continue your race. This is what the Lord said.

0:28:05.800,0:28:16.000
A new dream of walking with the Lord. A new dream for you.

0:28:22.700,0:28:29.000
When these attacks are not coming, your dream cannot come.

0:28:30.000,0:28:33.800
It is your dream that attract the challenges.

0:28:33.800,0:28:37.600
If there is no dream, there are no challenges.

0:28:37.600,0:28:43.300
No dream, no challenges.

0:28:43.300,0:28:51.600
Dream of walking with the Lord. If there is no dream of walking with the Lord, there are no challenges.

0:28:51.700,0:29:02.000
So, you are happy concerning a new dream; but it attracts challenges.

0:29:03.400,0:29:12.500
So, my brother when challenges come, remember your dream and your goal.

0:29:12.600,0:29:19.500
Nothing can be compared with your dream and your goal.

0:29:19.500,0:29:30.000
TWO - Don't forget what I said. It was not a message, it was a vision.

0:29:30.000,0:29:37.000
That your wailing will be silenced.

0:29:37.000,0:29:48.800
The voice of trouble, difficulty, and setback shall be silenced.

0:29:48.800,0:29:56.000
Their voices shall be silenced - write it down.

0:29:56.000,0:30:02.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:02.000,0:30:11.000
This will begin to manifest from June. From January to June, you will be ready to fight.

0:30:11.000,0:30:19.000
Challenges and difficulties from now until June.

0:30:19.000,0:30:43.620
But by June, when you trust and obey; satan will know that you cannot be separated. He will leave you alone.

0:30:43.620,0:30:44.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:44.500,0:30:52.000
All over the world. I am not talking to any particular nation. All over the world.

0:30:52.400,0:30:57.800
Those who are under the influence of my voice.

0:30:57.800,0:31:03.500
Viewers; you are under the influence of my voice. Can you write it down? It will guide you.

0:31:03.500,0:31:07.400
It's is a guide to help you throughout this year.

0:31:07.400,0:31:15.800
If you can do that, satan will soon know that you are not the type to be disturbed.

0:31:15.800,0:31:20.000
To be separated from God. He will soon know.

0:31:20.000,0:31:27.800
But satan has not yet known. He still believes that he can separate you from God.

0:31:27.800,0:31:34.000
That is why he keeps pushing you. He knows that soon you will follow him and renounce God.

0:31:34.800,0:31:41.400
Let him know that nothing can separate you from the love of God.

0:31:41.400,0:31:48.700
Tell your neighbor, "Let him know that nothing can separate you from the love of God".

0:31:48.700,0:32:08.000
Can hardship, sickness, infirmity, setback, poverty, humiliation or temptation? Nothing !

0:32:08.000,0:32:15.000
Talk to your God, talk to your God right now.

0:32:15.000,0:32:29.000
Nothing can make me look back ! Nothing can separate me !

0:32:31.500,0:32:48.000
They will come with their humiliation, challenges, setback, disease and sickness!

0:32:48.000,0:32:55.000
They will come, let them come!

0:32:56.220,0:33:02.400
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:33:02.400,0:33:15.200
Dream of walking with the Lord.  That means there will be grace for you, inner grace. Oh my God ...

0:33:18.200,0:33:26.200
All you lack and all you want - your business is not going well, your health is not ok.

0:33:26.200,0:33:30.200
Who owns your health? Who owns your business?

0:33:30.200,0:33:36.000
Don't you know that God is richer than your dream?

0:33:36.220,0:33:39.940
He will put everything in place.

0:33:39.940,0:33:48.780
I will not use the word "congratulations". I will say, "At last - a new dream has come".

0:33:48.780,0:33:51.580
Amen!!

0:33:51.580,0:33:54.980
You may be seated.

0:33:54.980,0:33:57.340
So, you are blessed.

0:33:57.340,0:34:05.120
Do you have any questions before we go further?

0:34:05.120,0:34:10.740
It's not really a question. You have just been speaking about me.

0:34:10.900,0:34:30.780
For 5 years and 7 months I have been in the bush fighting to come here.

0:34:30.780,0:34:36.120
I saw God, I saw Him.

0:34:36.120,0:34:48.900
You cannot see God; you can only hear His instruction.

0:34:48.900,0:34:59.340
God has given us discretion He cannot temper with. He gives us discretion to speak our mind.

0:34:59.340,0:35:10.600
But there can be a wrong discretion. We need to be in a proper state to act with God.

0:35:10.600,0:35:17.940
If you are not in a proper state to act with God, you need someone to intervene to be an intermediary.

0:35:17.940,0:35:20.900
How many years did you say you spent in the mountain?

0:35:20.900,0:35:22.200
5 years and 7 months.

0:35:22.200,0:35:30.200
Oh my God, I need to see you, Sir. Something is wrong somewhere.

0:35:30.200,0:35:33.200
While you were in the mountain, were you eating?

0:35:33.200,0:35:38.600
I was drinking once and eating once. These were the instructions.

0:35:38.600,0:35:39.100
Eating once?

0:35:39.100,0:35:42.000
I was eating once since 2002.

0:35:42.000,0:35:43.000
What time?

0:35:43.000,0:35:45.800
The 20th hour.

0:35:45.800,0:35:49.040
Ok, I want to see my brother like I said.

0:35:49.040,0:35:54.500
God is so much concerned about us, most especially when you have a family.

0:35:54.500,0:36:00.900
He will not now carry you from your family and put you on the mountain for 5 years.

0:36:00.900,0:36:04.000
With a family at home, with a wife and children.

0:36:04.000,0:36:11.500
Our God is concerned about us. He loves us so much just like He loves all His apostles.

0:36:11.500,0:36:17.700
So, that is why I am concerned that the God you are talking about carried you to the mountain for 5 years.

0:36:17.700,0:36:24.400
The family is at home and the children are home and you are eating once. What would the family eat?

0:36:24.400,0:36:29.100
You are the breadwinner of the family. I think that something is wrong somewhere.

0:36:29.100,0:36:30.000
Things were not normal.

0:36:30.000,0:36:39.700
I did not have anywhere to stay. I used to put on a green lady trousers and a pinky lady trousers.

0:36:39.700,0:36:44.400
Don't worry, Sir. I understand that something has happened, that is what I am saying.

0:36:44.400,0:36:49.800
Everything will be alright. That is why we are here. So, thank you.

0:36:49.800,0:36:57.100
Ok, any other question? Ok, let's ask our mommy here. You have a question, Ok.

0:36:57.100,0:37:06.840
So, these challenges will only attack us but not kill us?

0:37:06.840,0:37:09.940
She is afraid of death!

0:37:09.940,0:37:17.480
Do you hear what she is asking me? Do I mean that these challenges will only attack us but not kill us?

0:37:17.480,0:37:22.680
Already you have been having challenges, even as you are standing now, you have challenges.

0:37:22.680,0:37:26.800
But those challenges have not killed you, you are still alive?

0:37:26.800,0:37:27.800
Yes!

0:37:27.900,0:37:34.360
So, why do you think of death? Do you have a convenant?

0:37:34.360,0:37:36.940
No!

0:37:36.940,0:37:44.340
I was just thinking if a challenge like sickness comes on a loved one ...

0:37:44.340,0:37:46.760
Do you mean you have not been sick before?

0:37:46.760,0:37:48.720
I have.

0:37:48.720,0:37:51.420
That's it.

0:37:51.420,0:37:58.100
Thank you!!

0:37:58.100,0:38:01.260
You have answered all my questions.

0:38:01.260,0:38:08.960
Since 2017 is a wonderful year, I love my nation Kenya.

0:38:08.960,0:38:16.260
We are having elections. I am asking that you visit me in my dream so that I know how to pray about my nation.

0:38:16.260,0:38:19.120
God bless you, Sir.

0:38:19.120,0:38:22.460
You want to take me back to what I have written down there.

0:38:22.460,0:38:30.180
Even your country is one of the countries that is inside the paper there.

0:38:30.180,0:38:34.600
I will tell you a bit of what is inside that paper.

0:38:34.600,0:38:40.140
It will be very very close,

0:38:40.140,0:38:45.200
and it will be difficult to call. I will not say more than that.

0:38:45.200,0:38:52.000
Can you see? When something is close like this, it will be very difficult to call.

0:38:52.000,0:38:57.000
I don't want to go back to what is in the paper because it is one of the things in the paper.

0:38:57.000,0:39:07.800
It will be very close like this. The opposition and the ruling. It will very very difficult to call.

0:39:07.800,0:39:12.600
From there, I will not be able to say more than that because I am not here for that now.

0:39:12.600,0:39:17.200
Therefore, what can you expect from there. I will see you. Thank you.

0:39:17.200,0:39:19.460
So you love your nation so much.
