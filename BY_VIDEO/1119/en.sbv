0:00:44.900,0:00:49.900
Don't let this appearance take you off.

0:00:49.900,0:00:55.540
Let us celebrate the Being in my word today -

0:00:55.540,0:00:59.280
the Life, Jesus Christ.

0:00:59.280,0:01:02.220
Hallelujah!

0:01:02.220,0:01:04.440
Well.

0:01:04.440,0:01:10.020
Let us rise up and pray.

0:01:10.020,0:01:13.640
Viewers all over the world, let us pray.

0:01:13.640,0:01:25.540
We want to be one. If we are not one, we cannot move that mountain.

0:01:25.540,0:01:30.960
Now, we are going into His presence in a mighty way.

0:01:30.960,0:01:36.700
You must make sure your heart is not fearful.

0:01:36.700,0:01:44.360
You must make sure your heart does not comdemn you.

0:01:44.360,0:01:59.480
You must make sure your heart is in perfect fellowship with His living Word.

0:01:59.480,0:02:02.980
Be conscious that you are welcome.

0:02:02.980,0:02:08.140
Tell your neighbour, "Be conscious that you are welcome".

0:02:08.140,0:02:09.340
I can't hear you.

0:02:09.340,0:02:11.480
[Be conscious that you are welcome.]

0:02:11.480,0:02:12.680
I can't hear you.

0:02:12.680,0:02:14.680
[Be conscious that you are welcome.]

0:02:14.680,0:02:15.820
I can't hear you.

0:02:15.820,0:02:18.080
[Be conscious that you are welcome.]

0:02:18.080,0:02:19.160
Yes.

0:02:19.160,0:02:28.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:28.660,0:02:50.200
That root that keeps unforgiveness alive in you - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:50.200,0:03:01.640
That root that keeps anger, bitterness, envy, jealousy, pain of the past -

0:03:01.640,0:03:05.980
be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:05.980,0:03:08.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:08.120,0:03:09.980
Yes.

0:03:09.980,0:03:16.240
You need a free spirit to follow Him.

0:03:16.240,0:03:41.340
I have decided to follow Jesus

0:03:41.340,0:03:49.780
No turning back

0:03:49.780,0:03:51.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:51.480,0:03:59.280
You need a free spirit to follow Him.

0:03:59.280,0:04:12.580
The Spirit of God cannot share with a heart full of unforgiveness, anger, bitterness,

0:04:12.580,0:04:25.560
pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.

0:04:25.560,0:04:35.760
That root that keeps pain of the past alive in you - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:35.760,0:04:44.640
Be terminated, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:44.640,0:04:51.240
You know those areas in your life.

0:04:51.240,0:04:56.680
You know those against whom you are holding grudges.

0:04:56.680,0:04:59.900
Unforgiveness.

0:04:59.900,0:05:17.560
It is not always easy to forgive but we that are Christ's followers must follow His example.

0:05:17.560,0:05:19.120
Are you there?

0:05:19.120,0:05:25.040
It is not always easy to forgive the pain of the past

0:05:25.040,0:05:33.780
but we that are Christ's followers must follow His example.

0:05:33.780,0:05:44.980
If Christ could forgive the people who were killing Him,

0:05:44.980,0:05:58.600
we can certainly find a way to forgive those who hurt us.

0:05:58.600,0:06:13.160
When we cannot forgive, we are hurting ourselves more than anyone;

0:06:13.160,0:06:17.580
we are destroying ourselves more than anyone.

0:06:17.580,0:06:24.280
Tell your neighbour, "When you cannot forgive, you are destroying yourself,

0:06:24.280,0:06:29.680
you are hurting yourself more than anyone".

0:06:29.680,0:06:31.580
Tell your neighbour again.

0:06:31.580,0:06:36.400
[When you cannot forgive, you are destroying yourself more than anyone.]

0:06:36.400,0:06:44.140
Yes. You say, "Oh, that person embarrassed me! He insulted me!"

0:06:44.140,0:06:47.380
and you are holding that pain.

0:06:47.380,0:06:51.740
When you cannot forgive, you are hurting yourself,

0:06:51.740,0:06:55.900
you are destroying yourself and your future.

0:06:55.900,0:07:00.680
Any step you take, you take it into darkness, when you cannot forgive -

0:07:00.680,0:07:04.060
whether you are right or wrong.

0:07:04.060,0:07:06.840
More than anyone.

0:07:06.840,0:07:11.760
Nursing a grudge damages our heart.

0:07:11.760,0:07:16.860
Tell your neighbour, "Nursing a grudge damages our heart".

0:07:16.860,0:07:18.420
I can't hear you.

0:07:18.420,0:07:20.800
[Nursing a grudge damages our heart.]

0:07:20.800,0:07:22.040
I can't hear you.

0:07:22.040,0:07:24.440
[Nursing a grudge damages our heart.]

0:07:24.440,0:07:32.680
Nursing bitterness, unforgiveness, anger, pain of the past - whether you are right or wrong -

0:07:32.680,0:07:35.620
damages your heart.

0:07:35.620,0:07:42.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:42.700,0:07:46.480
Can you see?

0:07:46.480,0:07:51.740
Here you are.

0:07:51.740,0:07:55.320
In Your presence

0:07:55.320,0:08:12.360
In Your presence
I am content

0:08:12.360,0:08:23.780
In Your presence there is light
Expressions of Your love

0:08:23.780,0:08:31.300
Revelations of Your power and might

0:08:31.300,0:08:41.560
In Your presence I can bring
A love song offering

0:08:41.560,0:08:48.720
I'm in the presence of my King

0:08:48.720,0:08:51.480
Listen to that.

0:08:51.480,0:08:56.500
A step towards His presence - you are moving to His presence,

0:08:56.500,0:09:00.160
you want to move to God.

0:09:00.160,0:09:06.960
Your heart must be free from condemnation.

0:09:06.960,0:09:15.240
Make sure your heart is not fearful, does not condemn you,

0:09:15.240,0:09:23.000
is in perfect fellowship with His living Word.

0:09:23.000,0:09:28.140
Be conscious that you are welcome.

0:09:28.140,0:09:33.280
"Yes, I'm welcome."

0:09:33.280,0:09:36.760
Hallowed be

0:09:36.760,0:10:02.320
Hallowed be Your name

0:10:02.320,0:10:12.300
Lord and majesty
Divine authority

0:10:12.300,0:10:18.660
Hallowed be Your name

0:10:18.660,0:10:24.100
That is it. Hallowed be Your name.

0:10:24.100,0:10:28.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:28.740,0:10:37.180
Your heart must not be fearful.

0:10:37.180,0:10:44.520
Are you sure you are conscious that you are welcome?

0:10:44.520,0:10:51.720
When your heart is jumping up and down, the pain of the past?

0:10:51.720,0:10:56.760
Are you sure you are here?

0:10:56.760,0:10:59.400
[Yes!]

0:10:59.400,0:11:06.460
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to your heart.

0:11:06.460,0:11:13.980
He is Lord

0:11:13.980,0:11:17.760
Amen

0:11:17.760,0:11:28.340
He has risen from the dead
And He is Lord

0:11:28.340,0:11:40.160
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess

0:11:40.160,0:11:51.880
That Jesus Christ is Lord

0:11:51.880,0:12:02.240
It's not too late.

0:12:02.240,0:12:14.780
You can reconcile your account now.

0:12:14.780,0:12:16.900
In Jesus Christ's name!

0:12:16.900,0:12:18.520
[Amen!]

0:12:18.520,0:12:22.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:22.060,0:12:28.020
Ask your neighbour, "Are you sure that you are welcome?"

0:12:28.020,0:12:30.260
[Are you sure that you are welcome?]

0:12:30.260,0:12:32.840
Are you conscious that you are welcome?

0:12:32.840,0:12:35.880
[Are you conscious that you are welcome?]

0:12:35.880,0:12:37.360
You may be seated.

0:12:37.360,0:12:41.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:41.320,0:12:45.060
Hallelujah.

0:12:45.060,0:12:51.160
Let God's Word abide in us.

0:12:51.160,0:13:02.780
We take our reading from the Book of 1. Corinthians  2:13-14.

0:13:02.780,0:13:05.120
Take your time.

0:13:05.120,0:13:13.720
And the Book of Philippians 1:27.

0:13:13.720,0:13:25.620
And also the Book of John 15:7.

0:13:25.620,0:13:34.740
And the Book of James 1:21.

0:13:34.740,0:13:50.860
And the last reading will be 1 John 3:20.

0:13:50.860,0:13:56.460
Let me just take that first book

0:13:56.460,0:14:01.780
and I will leave the rest for you to read after the message.

0:14:01.780,0:14:06.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:06.720,0:14:13.220
1 Corinthians 2.

0:14:13.220,0:14:18.180
"And so it was with me, brothers and sisters.

0:14:18.180,0:14:28.460
When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom

0:14:28.460,0:14:34.460
as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God."

0:14:34.460,0:14:36.980
What is the testimony about God?

0:14:36.980,0:14:42.540
That is what I proclaimed to you.

0:14:42.540,0:14:54.200
"For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

0:14:54.200,0:15:03.160
I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling."

0:15:03.160,0:15:05.160
Verse 4.

0:15:05.160,0:15:17.440
"My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words

0:15:17.440,0:15:21.560
but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power

0:15:21.560,0:15:29.560
so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power."

0:15:29.560,0:15:37.420
That last verse - read it with me again - which is 5.

0:15:37.420,0:15:44.100
"so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power."

0:15:44.100,0:15:48.420
But today, our faith rests on human wisdom.

0:15:48.420,0:15:55.720
In the ministry of apostles - the ministry of Christ Jesus,

0:15:55.720,0:16:01.880
the spirit of man is the fountain of faith.

0:16:01.880,0:16:06.160
But today, our faith rests on human wisdom.

0:16:06.160,0:16:12.300
That is why we have not been seeing Jesus on the scene.

0:16:12.300,0:16:18.920
When we say, "Jesus Christ", where is Jesus Christ?

0:16:18.920,0:16:25.560
When you say, "Jesus Christ", you are to bring Jesus Christ to the scene.

0:16:25.560,0:16:31.720
Today, our faith rests on human wisdom.

0:16:31.720,0:16:40.460
Like I have given you - when you take your reading - the Book of Phillipians 1:27

0:16:40.460,0:16:50.340
and the Book of John 8:31 - you will get it clear.

0:16:50.340,0:16:58.600
And the Book of James 1:21.

0:16:58.600,0:17:06.460
And the last reading which is 1 John 3:20.

0:17:06.460,0:17:10.460
You have more.

0:17:10.460,0:17:16.900
Abide in the Word of God.

0:17:16.900,0:17:28.440
When you look around today, you will see that our schools, colleges, technical institutions

0:17:28.440,0:17:33.540
are for the moulding of the mind.

0:17:33.540,0:17:37.860
What do I mean by mind? - I mean, intellectual capacity.

0:17:37.860,0:17:43.120
This is what we are building.

0:17:43.120,0:17:52.060
We can see all over the world intellectual capacity.

0:17:52.060,0:17:59.640
All the knowledge we have has come through the senses.

0:17:59.640,0:18:06.160
And you will agree with me that there is nothing creative in the senses.

0:18:06.160,0:18:09.340
That is, there is nothing original.

0:18:09.340,0:18:16.460
Senses is about 'letter'. Where does the letter come from?

0:18:16.460,0:18:19.100
It is about 'letter' - "Jesus Christ".

0:18:19.100,0:18:29.420
This is why today, there is nothing original in reading the Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:18:29.420,0:18:37.360
Let me take the Bible to show you what I'm talking about.

0:18:37.360,0:18:39.060
See.

0:18:39.060,0:18:46.800
If I take the Bible because of my knowledge of the senses -

0:18:46.800,0:18:53.580
well educated or author - and I take it and read it -

0:18:53.580,0:18:56.260
Jesus this, Jesus that -

0:18:56.260,0:19:05.780
there is nothing original in reading the Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:19:05.780,0:19:16.380
There is nothing creative, there is nothing original in the letter.

0:19:16.380,0:19:18.060
It is 'letter'.

0:19:18.060,0:19:23.000
The Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit is 'letter'.

0:19:23.000,0:19:28.160
The Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit is mere 'letter'.

0:19:28.160,0:19:36.720
You can only teach it, preach it but to bring Jesus to the scene,

0:19:36.720,0:19:44.780
or to bring the Spirit of God into our heart - no.

0:19:44.780,0:19:49.280
This is why there is a cycle today.

0:19:49.280,0:19:56.600
We read the Bible without the help of the Holy Ghost.

0:19:56.600,0:20:06.380
How little we know about building our spirit.

0:20:06.380,0:20:17.840
That is why we read the Bible without the help of the Holy Ghost.

0:20:17.840,0:20:33.040
Unless today's church realises that the spirit of man is the fountain of faith,

0:20:33.040,0:20:53.000
that is when God - the Holy Spirit will be involved in our affairs -

0:20:53.000,0:20:58.040
the affair of the church and our life.

0:20:58.040,0:21:07.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:07.640,0:21:09.640
I take it again.

0:21:09.640,0:21:23.340
Unless today's church realises that the spirit of man is the fountain of faith,

0:21:23.340,0:21:34.060
that is when God - the Holy Spirit will be involved in our affairs.

0:21:34.060,0:21:41.620
If not, we are carrying 'letter', history.

0:21:41.620,0:21:46.420
That is why anyone can go to the bookshop and obtain a Bible

0:21:46.420,0:21:50.420
without being a Christian, without being a believer.

0:21:50.420,0:21:55.340
Just give money, they will give you a Bible.

0:21:55.340,0:22:07.180
When you go to many occult organisations today, you will see them using the same Bible

0:22:07.180,0:22:15.020
because it is a 'letter' without the Holy Ghost.

0:22:15.020,0:22:25.180
Without the Holy Ghost, it is a 'letter'.

0:22:25.180,0:22:36.600
Committing the Word to memory is valuable but does not do it -

0:22:36.600,0:22:45.000
I mean, does not bring Jesus to the scene, does not bring God's Spirit into our heart.

0:22:45.000,0:23:01.480
Committing the Word to memory - I mean, learning the history of the books of the Bible is valuable -

0:23:01.480,0:23:10.280
you can learn the history of the books of the Bible and become a lecturer, teacher, preacher;

0:23:10.280,0:23:17.940
it is valuable but does not do it - does not bring Jesus to the scene,

0:23:17.940,0:23:24.480
does not bring God's Spirit into our heart.

0:23:24.480,0:23:36.511
Learning the Hebrew or Greek words is valuable

0:23:36.511,0:23:41.480
but will not do it.

0:23:41.480,0:23:48.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:48.720,0:23:52.880
Only one thing

0:23:52.880,0:23:56.380
will do it:

0:23:56.380,0:24:11.880
Our doing the Word, living it in our daily life, practicing it, trusting in it, acting on it -

0:24:11.880,0:24:22.040
that is our secret.

0:24:22.040,0:24:26.700
Only one thing will do it:

0:24:26.700,0:24:33.020
Our doing the Word,

0:24:33.020,0:24:41.000
practicing it, living it in our daily life,

0:24:41.000,0:24:50.620
acting on it- that is our secret.

0:24:50.620,0:25:00.380
The just shall live by faith.

0:25:00.380,0:25:13.680
Faith has given birth to all the great achievements of man.

0:25:13.680,0:25:20.340
Feeding on the Word is feeding on God's wisdom.

0:25:20.340,0:25:24.360
Feeding on the Word is feeding on God's ability.

0:25:24.360,0:25:32.380
Feeding on the Word is feeding on God's very life.

0:25:32.380,0:25:41.520
Feeding on the Word - for you to know how important...

0:25:41.520,0:25:58.500
As you feed on the Word, it cultivates, strengthens, builds faith into you, builds God's ability into you,

0:25:58.500,0:26:20.580
builds your spirit up, builds into you every attractive thing that you see in the life of Jesus.

0:26:20.580,0:26:23.060
Trust and obey

0:26:23.060,0:26:26.720
For there's no other way

0:26:26.720,0:26:30.580
To be happy in Jesus

0:26:30.580,0:26:33.980
Than to trust and obey

0:26:33.980,0:26:42.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:42.840,0:26:50.780
Controlling your meditation while reading the Bible

0:26:50.780,0:26:59.880
gives ability to control your conduct and your speech.

0:26:59.880,0:27:12.520
Yielding your heart to the Word of God makes the Word a reality.

0:27:12.520,0:27:28.400
When you yield your heart to the Word of God, it makes the Word of God a reality.

0:27:28.400,0:27:48.120
When the Word becomes a reality, you become God-minded and Word-minded.

0:27:48.120,0:27:55.880
When you become God-minded and Word-minded, in the morning,

0:27:55.880,0:28:06.500
your spirit unconsciously goes to Him for guidance and wisdom for the day.

0:28:06.500,0:28:08.540
Unconsciously.

0:28:08.540,0:28:16.360
You will just wake up and find yourself...

0:28:16.360,0:28:23.940
Your spirit unconsciously goes to Him for guidance and wisdom for the day

0:28:23.940,0:28:35.160
when you become God-minded and Word-minded.

0:28:35.160,0:28:42.460
Tell your neighbour, "When you become God-minded and Word-minded,

0:28:42.460,0:29:03.600
your spirit unconsciously goes to God for guidance and wisdom for the day.

0:29:03.600,0:29:07.680
It is not an issue of "I have not prayed". How do you know you have not prayed?

0:29:07.680,0:29:09.280
It is a thing of the spirit.

0:29:09.280,0:29:11.100
"Wait for me, I want to pray."

0:29:11.100,0:29:14.860
Ah! Your prayer has become your job.

0:29:14.860,0:29:16.680
It is spiritual.

0:29:16.680,0:29:20.920
"Wait for me, I want to pray. Please tell him I'm praying."

0:29:20.920,0:29:24.560
"Hm, I'm praying. When you were calling me, I was praying."

0:29:24.560,0:29:28.800
It is becoming your job; not the Spirit's job.

0:29:28.800,0:29:39.320
When we don't know how to pray, the Spirit is helping our weakness.

0:29:39.320,0:29:49.980
When you become God-minded and Word-minded, in the morning,

0:29:49.980,0:30:08.200
your spirit unconsciously goes to God for guidance and wisdom for the day.

0:30:08.200,0:30:16.900
In the morning
Early in the morning

0:30:16.900,0:30:26.620
In the morning
I will rise and praise the Lord

0:30:26.620,0:30:36.240
In the morning
Early in the morning

0:30:36.240,0:30:46.300
In the morning
I will rise and praise the Lord

0:30:46.300,0:30:55.880
Good morning Jesus
Good morning Lord

0:30:55.880,0:31:05.800
I know You come from Heaven above

0:31:05.800,0:31:16.080
The Holy Spirit is on the throne

0:31:16.080,0:31:25.600
Good morning Jesus
Good morning Lord

0:31:25.600,0:31:35.760
I will enter His gates
With thanksgiving in my heart

0:31:35.760,0:31:46.400
I will enter His courts with praise

0:31:46.400,0:31:57.900
I will say this is the day that the Lord has made

0:31:57.900,0:32:08.880
I will rejoice for He has made me glad

0:32:08.880,0:32:18.840
He has made me glad
I am so glad

0:32:18.840,0:32:30.180
I will rejoice for He has made me glad

0:32:30.180,0:32:40.360
He has made me glad
I am so glad

0:32:40.360,0:32:49.700
I will rejoice for He has made me glad

0:32:49.700,0:32:57.460
When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.

0:32:57.460,0:33:01.240
You say, "Ah, what will I do this morning? I don't know what to do!"

0:33:01.240,0:33:03.340
"I don't know whether that business will be right."

0:33:03.340,0:33:06.020
"I don't know whether that man will attend to me."

0:33:06.020,0:33:09.040
"Ah, I'm worried. I don't know. Let me go."

0:33:09.040,0:33:13.920
When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.

0:33:13.920,0:33:15.020
Tell your neighbour.

0:33:15.020,0:33:19.620
[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]

0:33:19.620,0:33:20.860
I can't hear you.

0:33:20.860,0:33:25.000
[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]

0:33:25.000,0:33:26.440
I can't hear you.

0:33:26.440,0:33:30.440
[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]

0:33:30.440,0:33:31.780
I can't hear you.

0:33:31.780,0:33:36.100
[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]

0:33:36.100,0:33:39.060
You just find that in the morning, you start laughing.

0:33:39.060,0:33:41.580
People say, "Why are you laughing?"

0:33:41.580,0:33:44.520
"Because I'm happy!

0:33:44.520,0:33:52.800
Things may look very rough on the outside but on the inside, I'm happy!"

0:33:52.800,0:33:56.960
Because you are feeding on the Word.

0:33:56.960,0:34:09.180
When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.

0:34:09.180,0:34:16.060
When you feed on the Word, the Word becomes a reality.

0:34:16.060,0:34:26.600
In a crisis situation such as sickness, disease, hardship, poverty, you will not be afraid

0:34:26.600,0:34:39.680
because satan, the cause of crisis, has been defeated.

0:34:39.680,0:34:48.540
When you feed on the Word of God, the Word becomes a reality.

0:34:48.540,0:35:02.120
In a crisis situation such as sickness, disease, hardship, poverty, setback...you will not be afraid

0:35:02.120,0:35:08.420
because satan, the cause of crisis, has been defeated

0:35:08.420,0:35:24.880
and Jesus gave you the power of attorney to use His name.

0:35:24.880,0:35:31.880
Look, you need to know! This Bible is demanding!

0:35:31.880,0:35:51.820
As you feed on the Word, you dominate circumstances around you - live above them.

0:35:51.820,0:35:54.660
The Bible says, "Cheer up! I have overcome!"

0:35:54.660,0:35:56.380
It is true!

0:35:56.380,0:36:02.120
You just need to feed on the Word of God.

0:36:02.120,0:36:09.580
If that Word finds its way, if that Word of God finds its place in your heart,

0:36:09.580,0:36:23.380
by its very nature, it changes you automatically.

0:36:23.380,0:36:31.340
When you are changed, you will be called to act, to serve.

0:36:31.340,0:36:35.200
You will engage yourself in His projects - that is, God's projects.

0:36:35.200,0:36:37.220
There are God's projects.

0:36:37.220,0:36:41.660
The projects you are engaging yourself in -

0:36:41.660,0:36:44.780
there are God's projects and there are people's projects.

0:36:44.780,0:36:50.600
When you are called to serve, you engage in His projects.

0:36:50.600,0:37:06.740
When you engage in His projects, you begin to know God's opinion about yourself and others.

0:37:06.740,0:37:10.840
You know Jesus loves you.

0:37:10.840,0:37:15.340
How do you know when you do not belong to Him?

0:37:15.340,0:37:19.900
You can only belong to Jesus by being filled by His Spirit.

0:37:19.900,0:37:23.220
Are you filled by God's Spirit?

0:37:23.220,0:37:31.340
When you are filled by God's Spirit, you are emptied of your own.

0:37:31.340,0:37:35.760
You cannot be full of God's Spirit and also still of yourself.

0:37:35.760,0:37:41.700
Take more of me, give me more of You.

0:37:41.700,0:38:01.440
To belong to Jesus, you must be filled by His Spirit and emptied of your own.

0:38:01.440,0:38:03.980
Let's worship Him.

0:38:03.980,0:38:06.180
You raise me up

0:38:06.180,0:38:25.820
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

0:38:25.820,0:38:44.760
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

0:38:44.760,0:39:04.060
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

0:39:04.060,0:39:21.920
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

0:39:21.920,0:39:40.000
When I am down and oh my soul so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdens me

0:39:40.000,0:39:58.100
Then I am still and wait here in the silence
Until You come and sit a while with me

0:39:58.100,0:40:16.340
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

0:40:16.340,0:40:34.320
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

0:40:34.320,0:40:52.480
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

0:40:52.480,0:41:10.460
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

0:41:10.460,0:41:13.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:41:13.580,0:41:25.940
Now, the question - what is the state of your heart?

0:41:25.940,0:41:35.320
Because this is what we are talking about. You can't go anywhere without this heart.

0:41:35.320,0:41:56.420
Christianity lies in the heart. What is the state of your heart?

0:41:56.420,0:42:09.720
The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart full of unforgiveness, bitterness, anger, pain of the past,

0:42:09.720,0:42:15.200
bad feelings towards neighbours, bad feelings towards others.

0:42:15.200,0:42:19.840
What is the state of your heart?

0:42:19.840,0:42:32.380
So we are singing and dancing.

0:42:32.380,0:42:37.460
That is the question for you to answer now.

0:42:37.460,0:42:47.420
Ask yourself - what is the state of my heart?

0:42:47.420,0:42:53.800
We know it is not always easy to forgive.

0:42:53.800,0:43:06.840
We that are Christ's followers must live by His example.

0:43:06.840,0:43:14.600
If Christ could forgive the people who were killing Him -

0:43:14.600,0:43:23.360
"Father, forgive them", including you and I, "they don't know what they are doing" -

0:43:23.360,0:43:39.300
who is your Father, we can certainly find a way to forgive those who hurt us

0:43:39.300,0:43:52.380
because when you cannot forgive, the hurt on you is more than on anyone,

0:43:52.380,0:44:11.460
the destruction, failure, nightmare on you is more than on anyone - if you cannot forgive.

0:44:11.460,0:44:13.580
Tell your neighbour.

0:44:13.580,0:44:21.920
When we cannot forgive, the hurt on us is more than on anyone,

0:44:21.920,0:44:26.640
the destruction on us is more than on anyone,

0:44:26.640,0:44:31.240
the failure on us is more than on anyone,

0:44:31.240,0:44:37.640
the nightmare on us is more than on anyone.

0:44:37.640,0:44:51.440
Who needs forgiveness?

0:44:51.440,0:45:01.980
When you cannot forgive and you are saying, "I'm right, I'm just, I'm justified" -

0:45:01.980,0:45:06.260
you say, "You are right", they insulted you -

0:45:06.260,0:45:09.620
that is what you are holding against your neighbour...

0:45:09.620,0:45:24.300
If you cannot forgive, the hurt, destruction, failure, nightmare on you is more than on anyone.

0:45:24.300,0:45:26.720
This is what we are facing today.

0:45:26.720,0:45:29.980
This is what churches are facing today.

0:45:29.980,0:45:34.100
Unforgiveness is the burden we have.

0:45:34.100,0:45:38.140
"That man is not good", "That woman is not good", "That church is not good" -

0:45:38.140,0:45:42.080
as if you are the founder and you are God.

0:45:42.080,0:45:47.180
Because of that, you hold a grudge.

0:45:47.180,0:45:51.540
That "that man is not good" does not mean you should hold a grudge against him.

0:45:51.540,0:46:02.160
That is more of a reason why you should be his friend, to make him good.

0:46:02.160,0:46:03.640
Tell your neighbour.

0:46:03.640,0:46:11.780
That "that woman is not good" does not mean you should hold a grudge.

0:46:11.780,0:46:27.200
That is more of a reason why you should be her friend, to change her.

0:46:27.200,0:46:29.300
Can you face your neighbour and say:

0:46:29.300,0:46:37.160
"That you are not good does not mean I should hold a grudge against you.

0:46:37.160,0:46:47.660
That is more of a reason I should be your friend to change you."

0:46:47.660,0:46:50.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:50.680,0:46:53.420
So, where are we going?

0:46:53.420,0:47:01.020
Where are we going now? Can you see that you are not free of all this?

0:47:01.020,0:47:10.680
You are here today. You have so many enemies - uncountable ones.

0:47:10.680,0:47:13.600
You see them as the enemy.

0:47:13.600,0:47:16.920
No!  They are not your enemies!

0:47:16.920,0:47:27.400
They are to build you, mould you and reform you.

0:47:27.400,0:47:33.780
Those you call enemies are to build you, mould you and reform you.

0:47:33.780,0:47:40.520
How? They will make you pray the more, fast the more.

0:47:40.520,0:47:42.240
Hm. Over to you.

0:47:42.240,0:47:46.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:47:46.900,0:47:50.880
If someone makes you pray the more, is he your enemy?

0:47:50.880,0:47:55.300
If somebody makes you fast the more, you call him enemy?

0:47:55.300,0:48:07.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:48:07.860,0:48:18.460
If not the attack of the past, you cannot be strong like this.

0:48:18.460,0:48:21.420
You are strong in the Lord because of attack.

0:48:21.420,0:48:32.340
You are strong in the Lord because of what people are saying about you.

0:48:32.340,0:48:34.500
But I have said:

0:48:34.500,0:48:43.040
Settle your conscience because your heart is the communication point, the contact point for God.

0:48:43.040,0:48:46.420
If God wants to come to you, it is through your heart.

0:48:46.420,0:48:55.220
If your heart is full of envy, jealousy, unforgiveness, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others,

0:48:55.220,0:49:01.260
where would God come?

0:49:01.260,0:49:06.140
Your altar is your heart. Your prayer room is in your heart.

0:49:06.140,0:49:12.860
If your prayer room is dirty, full of unforgiveness and pain, you don't have a prayer room.

0:49:12.860,0:49:18.220
The altar you have at home is just cosmetic.

0:49:18.220,0:49:25.360
My altar at home is cosmetic; the real altar is here.

0:49:25.360,0:49:32.180
Thy Kingdom come.

0:49:32.180,0:49:36.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:49:36.680,0:49:37.400
Thank you.
