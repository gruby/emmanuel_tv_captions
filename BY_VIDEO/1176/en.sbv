IN MEMORY OF THE MARTYRS OF FAITH

0:00:04.220,0:00:14.820
Those who try to kill us are only helping us to go home and rest.

0:00:14.820,0:00:23.920
Whether we die young or old, what matters is the grace to continue living hereafter.

0:00:23.920,0:00:31.080
It is now four years since our beloved brothers and sisters slept in the Lord.

0:00:31.080,0:00:37.280
We must realise that their death is an unavoidable call -

0:00:37.280,0:00:44.620
a call to our Heavenly home that no one can disobey.

0:00:44.620,0:00:51.120
Jesus said that if you do not take up your cross and deny yourself daily

0:00:51.120,0:00:56.220
and perhaps even get killed for your belief in Him,

0:00:56.220,0:01:04.720
you are not worthy of Him.
(Matthew 10:38; Matthew 16:24)

0:01:04.720,0:01:13.940
The level at which satan attacks us seems to be equal to the level of our commmitment to the Lord.

0:01:13.940,0:01:18.360
I don't think enough people understand this.

0:01:18.360,0:01:25.600
If you are totally committed to God, He will take up satan's challenge against you.

0:01:25.600,0:01:32.140
As soon as we make a true conversion, a commitment asking Jesus to purchase us,

0:01:32.140,0:01:35.020
we become Jesus' property.

0:01:35.020,0:01:39.600
Then satan hates us the same way he hates Jesus.

0:01:39.600,0:01:42.700
That is why the moment we are truly saved,

0:01:42.700,0:01:50.800
we are engaged in a phenomental battle.
(John 15:18-22)

0:01:50.800,0:01:54.220
We cannot separate warfare from salvation.

0:01:54.220,0:02:00.400
True salvation is going to put you into direct conflict with satan.

0:02:00.400,0:02:04.480
Many of us would say, "Why should I suffer or die?

0:02:04.480,0:02:09.320
After all, Jesus won the victory on the Cross and suffered for me!"

0:02:09.320,0:02:14.140
But the question we need to ask ourselves is, "What did Jesus say?"

0:02:14.140,0:02:19.340
He said, "I have said unto you, the servant is not greater than his Master.

0:02:19.340,0:02:28.640
If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you". (John 15:20)

0:02:28.640,0:02:35.620
Anyone who claims that he does not have to suffer because Jesus did it for him

0:02:35.620,0:02:42.160
is indirectly saying that he is greater than his Master.

0:02:42.160,0:02:46.580
He is actually contradicting what Jesus said.

0:02:46.580,0:02:55.360
Basically, we need to give up our lives here on earth and gain eternal life in Heaven.

0:02:55.360,0:03:00.060
When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour,

0:03:00.060,0:03:08.700
we are accepting citizenship in Heaven and death here on earth.

0:03:08.700,0:03:15.020
Once Christ purchases us, we become aliens here on earth

0:03:15.020,0:03:20.340
and there is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.

0:03:20.340,0:03:26.400
We are servants, we simply obey the command of our Master.

0:03:26.400,0:03:32.180
We do not decide what suffering we must bear.

0:03:32.180,0:03:39.780
Many people have been serving the Lord fervently and have come into difficult life situations

0:03:39.780,0:03:47.000
because of being mistreated by either wicked men or carnal Christians.

0:03:47.000,0:03:51.500
The truth is that they have been treated unjustly.

0:03:51.500,0:03:56.920
But to become offended will only fulfill the enemy's purpose

0:03:56.920,0:04:01.660
of getting them out of the will of God.

0:04:01.660,0:04:07.900
If you stay free from offence, you will stay in God's will.

0:04:07.900,0:04:12.800
If you become offended, you will be taken captive by the enemy

0:04:12.800,0:04:18.620
to fulfill his own purpose and will.

0:04:18.620,0:04:23.900
If we are Christ's followers, we must follow His example.

0:04:23.900,0:04:27.780
If He could forgive the people who were killing Him,

0:04:27.780,0:04:33.500
we can certainly find a way to forgive those who hurt us.

0:04:33.500,0:04:39.780
When we cannot forgive, we hurt ourselves more than anyone.

0:04:39.780,0:04:44.820
Nursing a grudge damages our heart.

0:04:44.820,0:04:55.640
Life is too short to waste our time on things that have no lasting value or significance.

0:04:55.640,0:05:03.080
From eternity's perspective, death is not a period; it is only a comma

0:05:03.080,0:05:08.520
because of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection.

0:05:08.520,0:05:15.140
When a believer dies, he goes into glory, where there is no conflict.

0:05:15.140,0:05:18.740
Heaven is our home.

0:05:18.740,0:05:23.880
A man may die young yet be satisfied with living

0:05:23.880,0:05:33.080
but a wicked man is not satisfied even with long life.

0:05:33.080,0:05:39.180
Those who try to kill us are only helping us to go home and rest.

0:05:39.180,0:05:43.860
But those who send us home will go into further conflict;

0:05:43.860,0:05:48.620
they will have more questions to answer than when they were alive.

0:05:48.620,0:05:52.920
The wicked seem to prosper now and live without a care

0:05:52.920,0:05:57.420
but they will spend eternity in terror and despair.

0:05:57.420,0:06:02.100
How can we honour the memory of the martyrs of faith?

0:06:02.100,0:06:06.380
Endeavour by the grace of God to live for the Lord

0:06:06.380,0:06:10.640
and give yourself to the needs of others.

0:06:10.640,0:06:16.900
Romans 14:8 says, "If we live, we live for the Lord;

0:06:16.900,0:06:20.600
and if we die, we die for the Lord.

0:06:20.600,0:06:26.720
So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord".

0:06:26.720,0:06:30.700
What a blessed memorial!

0:06:30.700,0:06:40.960
How do I end this write-up?
Here, I drop my pen." - Prophet T.B. Joshua
