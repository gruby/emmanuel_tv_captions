Viewers, I know you are ready and the Spirit of God is much around to set us free.

0:00:10.920,0:00:14.340
He has descended already.

0:00:14.360,0:00:19.160
How He will remain - think about that.

0:00:19.160,0:00:27.040
Begin to talk to yourself. How He will remain - that is our challenge.

0:00:27.040,0:00:30.880
He does not remain in us when He is grieved.

0:00:30.880,0:00:33.100
I told you about offence.

0:00:33.100,0:00:40.500
When we hold a grudge against our brother, we have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:00:40.500,0:00:50.560
Whatever offence in the past, whatever pain in the past, it is time now to let go.

0:00:50.560,0:00:55.400
You have to do that now - before you receive.
