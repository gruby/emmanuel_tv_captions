As John 5:24 says, "He who hears My Word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life,

0:00:09.580,0:00:17.180
and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life."

On Wednesday, the 21st of February 2018,

0:00:22.840,0:00:31.680
God's General, Evangelist Billy Graham, was promoted to glory at the good old age of 99.

0:00:31.680,0:00:38.780
The legacy of Evangelist Billy Graham will live on forever in the hearts of believers worldwide,

0:00:38.780,0:00:45.860
and the countless thousands who came to the knowledge of saving grace through his ministry.

0:00:45.860,0:00:50.120
As Christians, our life is a race.

0:00:50.120,0:00:54.280
As ministers, our life is a warfare.

0:00:54.280,0:01:03.340
Like Apostle Paul, his warfare was accomplished, his race was run well, he has fought a good fight.

0:01:03.340,0:01:07.180
The course is good, the victory is sure.

0:01:07.180,0:01:13.080
As we celebrate the life and legacy of God's General, Evangelist Billy Graham,

0:01:13.080,0:01:18.680
let this moment prompt your hearts to make life's biggest decision as he did:

0:01:18.680,0:01:21.500
what to do with Jesus Christ.

0:01:21.500,0:01:27.480
You need not fear where you are going when you know Jesus is going with you.

0:01:27.480,0:01:32.380
Those who are born from above, long to be there.

0:01:32.380,0:01:35.100
Heaven is our home.

0:01:35.100,0:01:39.760
"Some day you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead. Don't believe a word of it.

0:01:39.760,0:01:43.960
I shall be more alive than I am now. I will just have changed my address.

0:01:43.960,0:01:49.340
I will have gone into the presence of God." 
- Billy Graham
