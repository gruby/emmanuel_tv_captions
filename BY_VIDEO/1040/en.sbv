0:00:00.080,0:00:03.440
I am Venerable Banmah Victor.

0:00:03.440,0:00:06.520
I'm a retired anglican priest.

0:00:06.520,0:00:13.560
I served the anglican communion for 15 years before I retired.

0:00:13.560,0:00:26.780
The woman next to me is the wife of my youth.

0:00:26.780,0:00:31.300
You must cherish the wife of your youth.

0:00:31.300,0:00:34.760
I'm getting to 82 years.

0:00:34.760,0:00:42.860
Venerable Banmah Victor & Wife
Retired Anglican Priest
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:00:42.860,0:00:47.180
The story I'm about to tell you is

0:00:47.180,0:00:54.500
what the motto of this church is - that distance is not a barrier.

0:00:54.500,0:00:57.860
I am of the anglican communion.

0:00:57.860,0:01:05.180
As you will know how people behave - I should not have anything to do with The SCOAN.

0:01:05.180,0:01:13.560
But the faith of God - if you demonstrate it, if you have it,

0:01:13.560,0:01:18.560
you can tell that mountain to move and it will move.

0:01:18.560,0:01:24.240
A mountain is not a physical thing. It's not. It does not exist anywhere.

0:01:24.240,0:01:29.440
Illness is a mountain and that is what I had.

0:01:29.440,0:01:32.580
I had pains in my ear.

0:01:32.580,0:01:38.560
And you know if you have pain in your ear, you will lose your balance.

0:01:38.560,0:01:43.800
So I started to fall in places where I thought I didn't need to.

0:01:43.800,0:01:46.420
Sometimes, I would fall in my room.

0:01:46.420,0:01:54.680
So I was afraid that I may not be able to attain the age of 81 that I am today.

0:01:54.680,0:02:02.520
But one night, my wife scrolled down to Emmanuel TV.

0:02:02.520,0:02:08.880
And I was there. I was sitting down lazily; I was looking at what was happening.

0:02:08.880,0:02:12.900
That whatever the prophet directed, I would do.

0:02:12.900,0:02:17.020
He said, "Affliction!"

0:02:17.020,0:02:19.700
Everybody would say, "Go!"

0:02:19.700,0:02:22.620
"Affliction!" - I also said the same thing, "Out!"

0:02:22.620,0:02:31.980

0:02:31.980,0:02:37.500
At the end of that session, I went into my room.

0:02:37.500,0:02:42.040
I started to have a slight pain on my temple.

0:02:42.040,0:02:46.940
I struck it a number of times, and the pain ceased.

0:02:46.940,0:02:52.320
But following that, immediately, I had some sensation in my nose.

0:02:52.320,0:02:58.940
And also following that, my right nostril was blocked.

0:02:58.940,0:03:02.260
I didn't know what it was. I thought it was mucus.

0:03:02.260,0:03:08.300
So I sucked it into my mouth and spat it out. It was like a twig.

0:03:08.300,0:03:11.860
I called my wife and said, "Something has come out from my nose".

0:03:11.860,0:03:16.100
We used the torch light. I started to look...

0:03:16.100,0:03:22.260
The evidence of what I saw is what is in this bottle.

0:03:22.260,0:03:27.440
It's a six-inches long worm.

0:03:27.440,0:03:33.600
You can imagine if this is in your body, you cannot live long.

0:03:33.600,0:03:39.880
I went to many doctors.

0:03:39.880,0:03:46.600
I went to an ENT specialist and she gave me drugs.

0:03:46.600,0:03:53.780
I also went to a physician who gave me exactly the same drugs.

0:03:53.780,0:03:55.900
They did nothing.

0:03:55.900,0:04:00.840
For over two years, I was battling with this problem.

0:04:00.840,0:04:05.120
Until that faithful day when I put my hand on the television

0:04:05.120,0:04:11.620
and said what the prophet was directing and this worm came out of my body.

0:04:11.620,0:04:15.540
Praise the Lord!

0:04:15.540,0:04:23.560
Our father, with due respect, ever since this worm came out of you, what are the things you can do now?

0:04:23.560,0:04:32.820
I don't stagger and I hear perfectly well.

0:04:32.820,0:04:42.540
At that time, I couldn't bite a bone but listen to how I rattle my teeth.

0:04:42.540,0:04:48.880
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:04:48.880,0:04:51.400
Now, our dear father,  what the Lord has done in your life,

0:04:51.400,0:04:55.060
what word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?

0:04:55.060,0:05:00.780
Sorry, I have a second testimony.

0:05:00.780,0:05:04.360
It follows the same pattern.

0:05:04.360,0:05:09.960
The prophet was praying and he said, "Those who eat with dead people in the night..."

0:05:09.960,0:05:15.880
I knew that I was eating with dead people in the night in my dreams.

0:05:15.880,0:05:21.500
So as he was praying, I was rubbing my stomach downwards.

0:05:21.500,0:05:28.140
Then immediately, I felt some movement in my stomach and the urge to go to the toilet.

0:05:28.140,0:05:36.700
So I rushed to the toilet and the only thing that came out was a round object as big as a ping-pong,

0:05:36.700,0:05:41.100
looking exactly like a walnut.

0:05:41.100,0:05:47.340
I didn´t take the picture of that because it was inside the water. Praise the Lord!

0:05:47.340,0:05:53.980
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:05:53.980,0:05:59.180
And ever since you passed out that stuff, do you still eat with dead people in your dreams?

0:05:59.180,0:06:01.360
No dreams anymore.

0:06:01.360,0:06:06.360
It happened on the 20th of last month.

0:06:06.360,0:06:10.780
Till today, I don't dream of any dead people or eat with them.

0:06:10.780,0:06:16.560
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:06:16.560,0:06:21.060
I will refer to the psalmist who said,

0:06:21.060,0:06:26.740
"If you hear the voice of God, do not harden your heart".

0:06:26.740,0:06:31.400
Today, the voice of God through the prophet is here,

0:06:31.400,0:06:37.180
it is louder and clearer and it is heard in all the continents.

0:06:37.180,0:06:43.260
So brothers and sisters, why will you not listen to the prophet?

0:06:43.260,0:07:05.420
Now, I´m imagining that very shortly, The SCOAN is going to become a pilgrimage destination.

0:07:05.420,0:07:10.300
That is, people will come from all over the world - not because they are sick

0:07:10.300,0:07:15.260
but to come and taste of what is happening here, to come and taste all the prayers,

0:07:15.260,0:07:22.800
to come and taste all the sermons and to come and taste all the teaching.

0:07:22.800,0:07:27.720
Brothers and sisters, I call on you. If you are far off, it doesn't matter.

0:07:27.720,0:07:32.040
Distance is nothing. It´s not a barrier. I call on you.

0:07:32.040,0:07:33.820
God loves you.

0:07:33.820,0:07:35.940
Jesus loves you.

0:07:35.940,0:07:41.140
The prophet of the Most High God T.B. Joshua also loves you.

0:07:41.140,0:07:46.380
He loves you with passion!

0:07:46.380,0:07:50.060
Praise the Lord!

0:07:50.060,0:07:56.960
My name is Mrs. Christiana Banmah. I'm 66 years old.

0:07:56.960,0:08:05.700
I confirm what my husband, my beloved husband, has said to be true.

0:08:05.700,0:08:12.800
And now you can see how fit he is, even at the age of 82 - going to 82.

0:08:12.800,0:08:20.200
He can chew bones but before this time, he could not do anything. I thank God Almighty!

0:08:20.200,0:08:25.500
I give Him the glory for using the great Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:08:25.500,0:08:32.720
to do mighty works in this land, in the whole world, in the lives of men and women.

0:08:32.720,0:08:35.580
Amen!

0:08:35.580,0:08:42.780
I want to seize this opportunity, to use this médium to remind and to advise

0:08:42.780,0:08:56.680
the doubting Thomases and the faithless pharisees, in quotes.

0:08:56.680,0:09:00.040
God is still saying something.

0:09:00.040,0:09:05.140
Don't harden your heart as in the day of provocation.

0:09:05.140,0:09:13.200
The purpose of God will be established in this country, in this SCOAN, in the name of Jesús!

0:09:13.200,0:09:17.580
God is still saying something so don't harden your heart.

0:09:17.580,0:09:20.600
That is the only advice I have for them.

0:09:20.600,0:09:27.860
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:09:27.860,0:09:30.500
God is still speaking.

0:09:30.500,0:09:34.960
He still has plenty of things to tell us.

0:09:34.960,0:09:42.740
And you can hear God through the prophet - the prophet of the Most High God.

0:09:42.740,0:09:50.240
What he has done for me, mainly through the televisión, it is a miracle.

0:09:50.240,0:09:58.160
When I mentioned it to my church - you know our church, you know how they can be.

0:09:58.160,0:10:03.340
They don't want to hear about any church where they make progress.

0:10:03.340,0:10:07.460
But I said, "No, this is not something I can keep to myself.

0:10:07.460,0:10:23.160
I must tell the whole world that there is a man in Nigeria, in Lagos,

0:10:23.160,0:10:33.580
in The SCOAN, that can do a lot of things to help humanity.

0:10:33.580,0:10:43.780
He has touched my life and he will touch the life of my children as time goes on. Praise the Lord!

0:10:43.780,0:10:50.840
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the Miracle-working God!
