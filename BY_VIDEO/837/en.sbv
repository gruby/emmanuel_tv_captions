The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:05.580,0:00:06.920
Hallelujah.

0:00:06.920,0:00:08.920
You may be seated. Thank you.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:12.180,0:00:15.240
Thank You, Jesus.

0:00:15.240,0:00:24.240
Viewers all over the world, Good Morning to you all.

0:00:24.240,0:00:28.340
Let's take our reading to the book of 1 Timothy.

0:00:28.340,0:00:34.360
Get home and read from Chapter 1 to the end.

0:00:34.360,0:00:40.260
But I will just go through verse 12 there.

0:00:40.260,0:00:44.100
The Lord's grace to Paul.

0:00:44.100,0:00:51.380
1 Timothy 1: 12: "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength,

0:00:51.380,0:00:59.820
that He considered me trustworthy, appointing me to His service."

0:00:59.820,0:01:01.820
Verse 13:

0:01:01.820,0:01:12.540
"Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man,

0:01:12.540,0:01:24.840
I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief."

0:01:24.840,0:01:31.700
Hallelujah. Take your reading from verse 1 when you get home -

0:01:31.700,0:01:36.640
from verse 1 to the end of 1 Timothy.

0:01:36.640,0:01:40.920
You will have so much to learn here.

0:01:40.920,0:01:43.420
Hallelujah.

0:01:43.420,0:01:48.780
I saw a woman when I was coming

0:01:48.780,0:01:53.360
who nearly felt so much discouraged.

0:01:53.360,0:02:02.540
I didn't know what happened between the woman, the usher and the worker.

0:02:02.540,0:02:05.520
I asked, "Madam, what happened?"

0:02:05.520,0:02:11.560
She said, "Oh! This is embarrassment!"

0:02:11.560,0:02:14.300
"Oh, embarrassment. Tell me what happened."

0:02:14.300,0:02:18.820
"Ah! I was about to come in... They were asking me..."

0:02:18.820,0:02:26.100
I said, "Ok. It is like you have so much to tell me, and I'm running out of time.

0:02:26.100,0:02:28.880
If you have so much to tell me, I'm running out of time.

0:02:28.880,0:02:31.340
There is no way I can listen.

0:02:31.340,0:02:33.480
So, let me leave you behind. Let me just...

0:02:33.480,0:02:37.740
Okay, after the service, just wait for me.

0:02:37.740,0:02:39.560
Forget about whatever happened.

0:02:39.560,0:02:43.100
Wait for me after the service. You will be my guest".

0:02:43.100,0:02:45.180
She laughed.

0:02:45.180,0:02:52.600
She had so much to tell me, and I was running out of time.

0:02:52.600,0:02:58.320
That will base my message today.

0:02:58.320,0:03:08.660
God cannot use a discouraged servant.

0:03:08.660,0:03:16.640
I will not say God cannot bless but let me say God cannot use a discouraged servant.

0:03:16.640,0:03:20.060
Are you one of the discouraged servants?

0:03:20.060,0:03:25.400
You can get irritated; anything can overwhelm you - just anything.

0:03:25.400,0:03:28.000
Maybe somebody messed there.

0:03:28.000,0:03:38.700
You know that the atmosphere was friendly but suddenly you begin to sense some nasty odour.

0:03:38.700,0:03:42.420
You will not be able to tell your neighbour that somebody has messed.

0:03:42.420,0:03:46.540
But you just feel so worried.

0:03:46.540,0:03:50.160
"This odour is not good! Somebody is messy!"

0:03:50.160,0:03:52.160
Anything can overwhelm you.

0:03:52.160,0:03:56.020
Anything can discourage you. You just say, "I'm leaving from here!"

0:03:56.020,0:04:00.720
The place you are going to may be even worse than the place you left.

0:04:00.720,0:04:04.300
Or even the atmosphere - maybe the weather.

0:04:04.300,0:04:10.960
You feel - "Look at the crowd! I don't know when and how this man can manage to attend to everyone!

0:04:10.960,0:04:15.060
What has he been doing since morning?"

0:04:15.060,0:04:24.100
God cannot use a discouraged servant.

0:04:24.100,0:04:38.320
We must overcome such attitude as a Christian.

0:04:38.320,0:04:46.380
Satan has a way of making you feel overwhelmed, worry and complain.

0:04:46.380,0:04:48.380
You are happy now.

0:04:48.380,0:04:51.760
But after a little time - maybe when I am praying for people, I just touched...

0:04:51.760,0:04:55.000
Suddenly maybe, I did not touch you.

0:04:55.000,0:05:00.020
"Ahh! These people have followed me here today!"

0:05:00.020,0:05:03.540
So, if they followed you here, they are the ones saying I shouldn't touch you.

0:05:03.540,0:05:05.080
Can you see?

0:05:05.080,0:05:07.740
You thought you are the next person to be touched.

0:05:07.740,0:05:12.040
Maybe somebody just fell on the floor, and I try to jump to the other side

0:05:12.040,0:05:15.880
and I escape you. You say, "Ah! These people have come here again!"

0:05:15.880,0:05:19.340
If they come here, would they ask me not to touch you?

0:05:19.340,0:05:22.860
If they have power over you, would they have power over me?

0:05:22.860,0:05:25.140
Over our Lord Jesus Christ?

0:05:25.140,0:05:27.360
So, anything, just anything.

0:05:27.360,0:05:31.660
Or maybe, probably, you are expecting to fall during the touching.

0:05:31.660,0:05:37.260
You saw your neighbour falling down but you are still standing.

0:05:37.260,0:05:46.880
"The thing does not work on me!"

0:05:46.880,0:05:51.220
You now begin to look at the people who are turning.

0:05:51.220,0:05:54.100
They have touched you and you are still the same.

0:05:54.100,0:05:58.760
"Ah! The thing does not work for me!"

0:05:58.760,0:06:00.920
God does as He wills.

0:06:00.920,0:06:03.960
It is not necessary that you should fall.

0:06:03.960,0:06:07.840
When God touches you, you may not even experience anything.

0:06:07.840,0:06:11.100
But God is working out the answer.

0:06:11.100,0:06:16.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:16.760,0:06:20.400
I may even not touch you. I may just see you and leave you.

0:06:20.400,0:06:24.580
That is the instruction given - "Don't touch this man. Don't touch this woman".

0:06:24.580,0:06:28.320
And the problem is gone without touching you.

0:06:28.320,0:06:31.240
It is the instruction. It is not you, it is me.

0:06:31.240,0:06:35.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:35.260,0:06:42.000
God cannot use a discouraged servant.

0:06:42.000,0:06:44.680
We must overcome such attitude.

0:06:44.680,0:06:50.360
So much of this attitude can lead to discouragement.

0:06:50.360,0:06:52.560
Even mosquito.

0:06:52.560,0:06:56.600
You may be fasting. You may be in the mountain for three days.

0:06:56.600,0:07:02.420
Suddenly, one big mosquito just comes.

0:07:02.420,0:07:04.420
That is the one that gives you awareness.

0:07:04.420,0:07:07.980
What about the one that has been on your body for two hours,

0:07:07.980,0:07:11.040
sucking so much blood?

0:07:11.040,0:07:16.940
By the time you just move your hand - a pool of blood!

0:07:16.940,0:07:23.580
"Oh! This mosquito has carried many diseases!"

0:07:23.580,0:07:26.480
A lot of discouragement.

0:07:26.480,0:07:37.040
We must confess with our mouth like the Book of Revelation 12:11 says

0:07:37.040,0:07:46.760
because what goes around must surely come around.

0:07:46.760,0:07:59.260
When we plant a wrong seed, a wrong harvest will surely come.

0:07:59.260,0:08:06.460
So, our confession is very important - what you say -

0:08:06.460,0:08:12.440
by saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.

0:08:12.440,0:08:21.000
Tell your neighbour: By saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.

0:08:21.000,0:08:22.460
I can't hear you.

0:08:22.460,0:08:25.820
By saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.

0:08:25.820,0:08:27.820
I can't hear you.

0:08:27.820,0:08:41.000
By saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.

0:08:41.000,0:08:47.900
We are made to overcome.

0:08:47.900,0:09:01.620
The Book of Philippians 4:13 says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me".

0:09:01.620,0:09:08.660
By saying about yourself what the Bible says about you.

0:09:08.660,0:09:13.660
What does the Bible say about you?

0:09:13.660,0:09:27.200
No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, stay steady.

0:09:27.200,0:09:32.220
Look at what the Bible says in the Book of 1 Timothy.

0:09:32.220,0:09:52.400
Paul warned Timothy not to take a step back when he is sick, attacked, persecuted.

0:09:52.400,0:10:09.280
He warned him not to take a step back when he is sick, persecuted or discouraged.

0:10:09.280,0:10:11.480
But what is happening to you today?

0:10:11.480,0:10:17.620
Remember, what is good for Timothy is equally good for us.

0:10:17.620,0:10:37.480
He is warning us not to take a step back while we are facing persecution or crisis

0:10:37.480,0:10:48.180
because persecution or whatever you call it is meant for our spiritual benefit.

0:10:48.180,0:10:51.780
What do you understand under "take a step back"?

0:10:51.780,0:10:56.900
By beginning to complain, looking at Jesus in a bad light.

0:10:56.900,0:10:59.620
"Why me of all this? Why me of all that?

0:10:59.620,0:11:03.160
I have stopped smoking. I have stopped drinking.

0:11:03.160,0:11:12.940
I have been praying. I go to church regularly. Why all this crisis? Why all this? Why all that?"

0:11:12.940,0:11:17.120
That is the beauty of our journey to eternal life.

0:11:17.120,0:11:33.500
Don't forget, we are not in Heaven. Something must punch us, poke us and test our faith.

0:11:33.500,0:11:37.540
He went further by saying,

0:11:37.540,0:11:42.060
"Timothy, I know what you are talking about.

0:11:42.060,0:11:46.340
You are talking about your setback,

0:11:46.340,0:11:49.380
you are talking about your sickness,

0:11:49.380,0:11:52.840
you are talking about people that accused you wrongly,

0:11:52.840,0:11:56.580
you are talking about this, you are talking about that.

0:11:56.580,0:12:01.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:01.120,0:12:04.400
When you read that Chapter down, he says that

0:12:04.400,0:12:15.360
he messed up big time but God enabled him.

0:12:15.360,0:12:19.720
"To mess up big time" means that he has done a lot,

0:12:19.720,0:12:28.580
being a persecutor, blasphemor and killer - this and that.

0:12:28.580,0:12:43.760
When you look up the word 'enable', it means to support with means, power and knowledge.

0:12:43.760,0:12:52.260
When God gives enablement, He gives everything.

0:12:52.260,0:13:02.220
Even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you fear not.

0:13:02.220,0:13:12.220
Paul Apostle said to Timothy, "I know what it is like to feel like giving up

0:13:12.220,0:13:22.640
while sick, facing disappointment or persecution".

0:13:22.640,0:13:42.560
He said he knew what it was like but he did not do it; he held on and kept fighting.

0:13:42.560,0:13:51.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:51.460,0:13:59.900
He held on and kept fighting.

0:13:59.900,0:14:13.100
The beauty of our journey is when you are going and something is there to punch you.

0:14:13.100,0:14:18.340
But when you are going and nothing punches you, you are free, 

0:14:18.340,0:14:23.120
how will you know that the Father you are serving is beautiful.

0:14:23.120,0:14:27.940
When you don't sit for an examination and read and sweat

0:14:27.940,0:14:31.220
to get a promotion, how will you value the promotion?

0:14:31.220,0:14:37.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:37.920,0:14:44.120
If you do not read day and night,

0:14:44.120,0:14:51.420
in a quiet place reading a lot of textbooks,

0:14:51.420,0:14:54.460
sitting for the exam - very tough -

0:14:54.460,0:14:59.500
and at the end of the day, you come out brilliantly,

0:14:59.500,0:15:03.260
how will you value your certificate?

0:15:03.260,0:15:06.920
Why are you proud to introduce yourself as a graduate?

0:15:06.920,0:15:09.740
"I have a first degree, PhD."

0:15:09.740,0:15:15.820
You are proud to introduce yourself because of what you have gone through to have that.

0:15:15.820,0:15:22.380
The beauty of our journey is when something is there to test our faith.

0:15:22.380,0:15:28.700
That is the beauty of our journey.

0:15:28.700,0:15:32.760
But you never knew this.

0:15:32.760,0:15:36.020
Various tests that would have promoted you spiritually,

0:15:36.020,0:15:41.280
you failed them because you see them as an attack from the enemy.

0:15:41.280,0:15:48.320
You see them as undeserved attacks, undeserved issues

0:15:48.320,0:15:55.720
instead of you to welcome that and see that as a friend to move you forward.

0:15:55.720,0:16:00.920
Your situations are friends to move you forward.

0:16:00.920,0:16:09.180
Your challenges are friends to move you ahead.

0:16:09.180,0:16:20.240
Tell your neighbour: Let your situation produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:16:20.240,0:16:22.240
I can't hear you.

0:16:22.240,0:16:25.780
Let your situation produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:16:25.780,0:16:36.040
Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:16:36.040,0:16:38.040
I can't hear you.

0:16:38.040,0:16:41.720
Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:16:41.720,0:16:43.140
Again.

0:16:43.140,0:16:46.740
Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:16:46.740,0:16:55.600
Yes, when you have challenges and those challenges now strengthen your desire for God.

0:16:55.600,0:16:59.200
They cause you to look unto God the more.

0:16:59.200,0:17:03.180
You are a type that sleeps anyhow, eats anyhow.

0:17:03.180,0:17:12.580
But when the challenges come, you go into fasting and pray the more.

0:17:12.580,0:17:15.860
It is no longer a challenge but a promotion.

0:17:15.860,0:17:23.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:23.620,0:17:31.440
Write this: Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:17:31.440,0:17:39.720
When the challenges come - it could be sickness, poverty, hardship, temptation or any foolish thing,

0:17:39.720,0:17:47.900
and you quickly look unto God and cry to God, it's meant for promotion.

0:17:47.900,0:17:53.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:53.320,0:18:02.260
Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:18:02.260,0:18:13.860
That is, when we pray, "Oh God, I cannot get along without You; help me!"

0:18:13.860,0:18:22.880
He will show Himself stronger.

0:18:22.880,0:18:29.260
But when challenges come and it does not produce a sense of dependence on God,

0:18:29.260,0:18:34.000
you are leading to the grave.

0:18:34.000,0:18:40.340
Challenges come - it could be trouble -

0:18:40.340,0:18:43.480
and when that trouble comes, you enter into more trouble again,

0:18:43.480,0:18:46.500
more trouble again, more trouble again, more trouble again,

0:18:46.500,0:18:49.460
and you never look unto God to get out of that trouble,

0:18:49.460,0:18:51.900
you know that this is the end of you.

0:18:51.900,0:18:54.920
How do we know promotion is coming?

0:18:54.920,0:18:59.800
When challenges come and produce a sense of dependence on God,

0:18:59.800,0:19:02.420
you know you are about to be promoted.

0:19:10.860,0:19:22.220
No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, stay steady.

0:19:22.220,0:19:28.520
Make this confession your roadmap.

0:19:28.520,0:19:35.140
I'm standing on the promise of God.

0:19:35.140,0:19:52.640
I am living steady, walking steady, remaining steady in unsteady times.

0:19:52.640,0:19:58.740
I choose not to be broke.

0:19:58.740,0:20:03.180
I choose not to live in poverty.

0:20:03.180,0:20:06.640
I choose not to walk in disappointment.

0:20:06.640,0:20:14.740
I choose to walk in God's way.

0:20:14.740,0:20:19.300
This world is unsteady.

0:20:19.300,0:20:21.880
It is unsteady.

0:20:21.880,0:20:23.940
This world you are living in is unsteady.

0:20:23.940,0:20:27.880
This is why the Bible says, "In this world, there will be tribulation",

0:20:27.880,0:20:30.660
because it is unsteady.

0:20:30.660,0:20:34.780
There will be lying, killing, stealing.

0:20:34.780,0:20:39.340
You look here - rubbish. You look there - rubbish.

0:20:39.340,0:20:41.440
You can't close your eyes when walking.

0:20:41.440,0:20:50.400
Even if you close your eyes, your heart will be yearning to smoke, for fleshly desires.

0:20:50.400,0:20:58.680
While having your eyes closed, your heart will still yearn for fleshly desires.

0:20:58.680,0:21:07.700
So, we are in an unsteady world.

0:21:07.700,0:21:13.560
This is why the song says, "This world is not my home".

0:21:13.560,0:21:17.220
This world is not my home

0:21:17.220,0:21:21.140
I'm just passing through

0:21:21.140,0:21:24.940
My treasures are laid up

0:21:24.940,0:21:29.040
Somewhere beyond the blue

0:21:29.040,0:21:36.300
The angels beckon me from Heaven's open doors

0:21:36.300,0:21:43.900
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

0:21:43.900,0:21:48.700
This world is not my home

0:21:48.700,0:21:52.120
I'm just passing through

0:21:52.120,0:21:56.660
My treasures are laid up

0:21:56.660,0:22:00.840
Somewhere beyond the blue

0:22:00.840,0:22:08.780
The angels beckon me from Heaven's open doors

0:22:08.780,0:22:18.500
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

0:22:18.500,0:22:22.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:22.420,0:22:27.600
We are in an unsteady world.

0:22:27.600,0:22:30.420
So, I want to leave you here.

0:22:30.420,0:22:32.860
Take this: 

0:22:32.860,0:22:41.400
When your situation reminds you of God, know that promotion is coming.

0:22:41.400,0:22:47.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:47.260,0:22:57.740
Tell your neighbour: When your situation reminds you of God, know that promotion is coming.

0:22:57.740,0:23:05.120
This is what I mean by our situation is meant for our spiritual benefit.

0:23:05.120,0:23:10.660
Our situation produces a sense of dependence on God.

0:23:10.660,0:23:14.740
When you have a situation, headache or a doctor says to you,

0:23:14.740,0:23:19.500
"Oh! This is serious! This is cancer! This is the liver!",

0:23:19.500,0:23:27.240
and this reminds you immediately of God, knowing that promotion is coming.

0:23:27.240,0:23:36.320
It is not meant to destroy you but to improve you - your relationship with God.

0:23:36.320,0:23:42.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:42.500,0:23:49.960
So, for other people - their situation does not remind them of God

0:23:49.960,0:23:58.000
because that situation is meant to destroy them.

0:23:58.000,0:24:03.780
But we - our situation reminds us of God.

0:24:03.780,0:24:09.420
That is why it produces a sense of dependence on God.

0:24:09.420,0:24:12.640
Our situation reminds us of God.

0:24:12.640,0:24:15.320
That situation is to improve us.

0:24:15.320,0:24:19.700
When you have a situation - no matter how big that situation -

0:24:19.700,0:24:26.780
and it reminds you of God, and you begin to fast and pray,

0:24:26.780,0:24:36.860
it is meant to build your relationship and strengthen your desire for God.

0:24:36.860,0:24:48.140
Rise up and make this confession your standard from today:

0:24:48.140,0:24:53.020
I'm standing on the promise of God.

0:24:53.020,0:25:07.060
I'm living steady, walking steady, remaining steady in unsteady times.

0:25:07.060,0:25:09.060
Thank you.

0:25:09.060,0:25:16.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:16.800,0:25:19.100
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:25:19.100,0:25:22.760
So, you think that the ground is smooth for me.

0:25:22.760,0:25:28.380
In a little time you hear T.B. Joshua is in America, T.B. Joshua is there.

0:25:28.380,0:25:32.500
You say, "Oh, this man! Oh my God, he is not going through what I'm going through!

0:25:32.500,0:25:34.980
Look! Everything is just smooth for this man!"

0:25:34.980,0:25:40.120
Ooh! The ground is not smooth! It is like this!

0:25:40.120,0:25:42.760
Just like you are walking on it, I'm walking on it.

0:25:42.760,0:25:49.120
But I'm living steady in an unsteady world.

0:25:49.120,0:25:54.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:54.260,0:25:56.520
Yes, it is not smooth for you.

0:25:56.520,0:25:58.640
You go by the standard of the ground.

0:25:58.640,0:26:00.240
I'm not going by the standard.

0:26:00.240,0:26:05.260
This is how the ground is vibrating and you too go by that vibration.

0:26:05.260,0:26:09.140
The ground is vibrating like this but I remain steady.

0:26:09.140,0:26:13.820
Whilst it is vibrating, I remain steady.

0:26:13.820,0:26:18.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:18.400,0:26:21.640
We are living in the same world.

0:26:21.640,0:26:23.840
We are eating the same food.

0:26:23.840,0:26:30.080
But the difference is that whilst the ground is vibrating - this way -,

0:26:30.080,0:26:34.240
you go by that vibration.

0:26:34.240,0:26:37.880
Because of that, whatever you carry, seems to fall.

0:26:37.880,0:26:43.860
But I walk steady on the vibrating ground.

0:26:43.860,0:26:48.120
I say, "No! I refuse to be broke.

0:26:48.120,0:26:49.900
I refuse to be poor.

0:26:49.900,0:26:52.360
I refuse to live in poverty

0:26:52.360,0:26:57.160
and I refuse to walk in discouragement!"

0:26:57.160,0:27:02.560
There's a lot of discouragement around but I refuse to walk in discouragement.

0:27:02.560,0:27:06.420
But you are walking in discouragement.

0:27:06.420,0:27:11.040
So much poverty around - just like you are seeing them, I am seeing them.

0:27:11.040,0:27:17.820
But I refuse to live in poverty.

0:27:17.820,0:27:24.380
So, we are walking on the same floor - unsteady world.

0:27:24.380,0:27:28.020
You are living there - you are there and I am there.

0:27:28.020,0:27:33.280
And it is not steady at all but you go by that vibration.

0:27:33.280,0:27:36.400
I refuse to.

0:27:36.400,0:27:45.340
You can refuse to. The name Jesus is given to you.

0:27:45.340,0:28:01.680
"Behold, I give you power to trample on scorpions and snakes."

0:28:01.680,0:28:04.040
Let me pray with you.

0:28:04.040,0:28:09.300
I pray the Lord gives you a hearing heart.

0:28:09.300,0:28:14.580
When situations come - no matter the sickness, disease, temptation,

0:28:14.580,0:28:18.800
false accusation or whatever comes to you and you know you are a Christian,

0:28:18.800,0:28:28.060
it is time to look unto God, the Finisher of our faith,

0:28:28.060,0:28:33.780
and He will show Himself stronger.

0:28:33.780,0:28:36.640
So, take this message.

0:28:36.640,0:28:41.360
But if you are not a Christian, not a believer, this is not an issue

0:28:41.360,0:28:47.300
because for others, their situation destroys them.

0:28:47.300,0:28:50.900
Their situation cannot make them look unto God.

0:28:50.900,0:28:57.000
Their situation cannot produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:28:57.000,0:29:00.440
Rather, their situation takes them away.

0:29:00.440,0:29:03.960
You may be seated.

0:29:03.960,0:29:13.460
If you are a believer, stop seeing your situation as an enemy.

0:29:13.460,0:29:24.640
Let your situation produce a sense of dependence on God.

0:29:24.640,0:29:34.520
When we pray, "Oh Lord, I cannot get along without You",

0:29:34.520,0:29:39.760
He will show Himself stronger.

0:29:39.760,0:29:47.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:47.660,0:29:49.600
Thank you.

0:29:49.600,0:29:55.460
Come on. What lesson have you learnt from this message?

0:29:55.460,0:29:59.880
I have learnt that I must depend on God.

0:29:59.880,0:30:08.060
Whatever challenge or situation I go through, I must depend on God's Word.

0:30:08.060,0:30:20.080
Your situation should produce a sense - that is, a feeling that it is time to go to God the more.

0:30:20.080,0:30:23.200
You shouldn't leave that for your situation.

0:30:23.200,0:30:31.280
You that have the situation should know that you need God the more

0:30:31.280,0:30:35.460
I need God the more.

0:30:35.460,0:30:43.340
I need You more and more

0:30:43.340,0:30:45.380
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:30:45.380,0:30:48.560
That is the voice of situation.

0:30:48.560,0:30:51.560
That is the voice of a Christian's situation.

0:30:51.560,0:30:55.720
That is the voice of a believer's situation that hears the voice.

0:30:55.720,0:30:59.760
Not others - others' situation cannot say this.

0:30:59.760,0:31:02.280
But our situation - this is the voice.

0:31:02.280,0:31:04.580
Sing again - listen to the voice.

0:31:04.580,0:31:07.280
I need You more and more

0:31:07.280,0:31:08.740
That is situation.

0:31:08.740,0:31:12.640
I need You more and more

0:31:12.640,0:31:20.660
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:31:20.660,0:31:28.860
I need You more and more

0:31:28.860,0:31:36.900
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:31:36.900,0:31:41.080
Like a flower needs the rain

0:31:41.080,0:31:45.180
Like a bird needs the wind

0:31:45.180,0:31:50.800
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:31:50.800,0:31:52.060
Thank you. 

0:31:52.060,0:31:57.100
You are crying. Why are you crying?

0:31:57.100,0:32:00.400
What do you want to tell the world about this message?

0:32:00.400,0:32:03.620
I'm so thankful for this message because it spoke into my heart.

0:32:03.620,0:32:07.220
For every situation that I face, I mustn't think it is the end of the world.

0:32:07.220,0:32:10.380
I must just know that God is there for me and I must just push through

0:32:10.380,0:32:12.760
and have the Word of God inside of me.

0:32:12.760,0:32:14.980
Thank you.

0:32:14.980,0:32:17.140
Any other?

0:32:17.140,0:32:18.900
Can I hear from you?

0:32:18.900,0:32:22.060
How does the message appeal to you?

0:32:22.060,0:32:24.880
This is exactly correct.

0:32:24.880,0:32:28.140
My situation demanded to bring me here.

0:32:28.140,0:32:29.860
This is exactly correct.

0:32:29.860,0:32:36.160
I am a pastor but wherever I go, there are failures.

0:32:36.160,0:32:39.520
That failures that come to me are right and correct.

0:32:39.520,0:32:42.780
Thank you. He said he is a minister of God.

0:32:42.780,0:32:46.660
He looked at situations before now as an enemy but it is a friend.

0:32:46.660,0:32:50.960
It is more of our friend than our enemy.

0:32:50.960,0:32:54.020
Our situation is more of our friend than our enemy.

0:32:54.020,0:32:58.340
Tell your neighbour: Our situation is more of our friend than our enemy.

0:32:58.340,0:33:04.340
My situation is more of my friend than my enemy.

0:33:04.340,0:33:08.640
Yes, it is more of our friend than our enemy.

0:33:08.640,0:33:10.000
That is it.

0:33:10.000,0:33:14.800
I know what situation has done in my life - to me.

0:33:14.800,0:33:19.040
I'm using my life to preach a message to you.

0:33:19.040,0:33:22.960
If not the situation from the beginning of my ministry,

0:33:22.960,0:33:26.340
I don't think I would be of this level today.

0:33:26.340,0:33:32.040
Your rejection becomes a blessing to me.

0:33:32.040,0:33:39.240
Your rejection leads to my closeness to God,

0:33:39.240,0:33:43.720
helping me to build my relationship with God,

0:33:43.720,0:33:47.440
helping me to have enough time for God.

0:33:47.440,0:33:49.600
Yes, your rejection.

0:33:49.600,0:33:54.960
At a time you realised that "Oh no! This is a man we should move closer to",

0:33:54.960,0:33:57.720
well, I think I have come very close to God.

0:33:57.720,0:34:02.020
At the beginning, if you had accepted me, I think I would have had problems. 

0:34:02.020,0:34:11.700
Big problems - your acceptance would have led to fall, to failure.

0:34:11.700,0:34:16.680
Acceptance at the beginning of my ministry - "He is a man of God!" -

0:34:16.680,0:34:20.420
today you would not talk about The Synagogue

0:34:20.420,0:34:27.420
because then, I was not mature to maintain acceptance.

0:34:27.420,0:34:31.240
Now I am mature to maintain acceptance.

0:34:31.240,0:34:33.800
You can accept me; I am ready.

0:34:33.800,0:34:37.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:37.100,0:34:39.540
You know, there is time for everything. 

0:34:39.540,0:34:45.940
This is why I don't fight back because God allowed you to reject me from the beginning of the ministry. 

0:34:45.940,0:34:50.980
The rejection from the beginning of the ministry was allowed by God

0:34:50.980,0:35:00.300
because God was building me and I was not mature to have all over the world around me then.

0:35:00.300,0:35:03.240
I needed some experience.

0:35:03.240,0:35:05.860
Oh yes!
