0:00:00.080,0:00:02.560
There is a woman there; as I am talking now;

0:00:02.560,0:00:05.340
she is ready to look for her former husband.

0:00:05.340,0:00:08.200
She has lost her husband for some months now.

0:00:08.200,0:00:10.840
Her spirit is saying, 'I am going to call my husband,

0:00:10.840,0:00:14.340
I am going to look for my husband ' and say, Please, whatever happened, 'I am very sorry'.

0:00:14.340,0:00:15.640
She is there!

0:00:15.640,0:00:17.960
The woman wants to reconcile now.

0:00:17.960,0:00:19.620
I know your husband has offended you.

0:00:19.620,0:00:21.140
But you really want to reconcile.

0:00:21.140,0:00:25.900
She said, she wants to bring this man here to know God's opinion.

0:00:25.900,0:00:26.940
The woman is there.

0:00:26.940,0:00:28.800
You put a chain on your neck.

0:00:28.800,0:00:30.420
Come! She is there.

0:00:37.100,0:00:39.660
Don't worry! Please, I want to meet her.

0:00:39.660,0:00:40.740
Let her wait for me.

0:00:40.740,0:00:45.600
Prophecy Confirmation

0:00:46.680,0:00:49.820
My name is Jane Udensi.

0:00:49.820,0:00:53.200
I come from Anambra state, Nigeria.

0:00:53.200,0:00:56.340
The man of God said, there is a woman here,

0:00:56.340,0:01:01.400
and he pointed his hand in the direction where I was staying.

0:01:01.400,0:01:07.400
He said that there was a woman there - her husband left her for some months now,

0:01:07.400,0:01:10.760
and that she was ready to reconcile with her husband but there was no way.

0:01:10.760,0:01:16.320
He also mentioned that the woman put a necklace on her neck.

0:01:16.320,0:01:18.120
I confirm it to be true.

0:01:18.120,0:01:20.860
How can you confirm this prophecy to be true?

0:01:20.860,0:01:27.400
I confirm it to be true because for some months now, my husband left me.

0:01:27.400,0:01:31.660
We had been quarrelling and fighting and he left me

0:01:31.660,0:01:35.840
because of the fruit of the womb. We had had no children since we married.

0:01:35.840,0:01:39.120
It affected my marriage because there was no peace;

0:01:39.120,0:01:41.860
we fought and quarrelled all the time.

0:01:41.860,0:01:47.880
He sent me packing and married another woman

0:01:47.880,0:01:51.140
and asked me to go for another man.

0:01:51.140,0:01:53.940
There was no peace, no joy, no affection.

0:01:53.940,0:02:04.380
In the last two months, he threw my things outside and seized the others.

0:02:04.380,0:02:09.740
I didn't do anything; he beat me and threw my things outside.

0:02:09.740,0:02:12.840
I confirm the prophecy to be true.

0:02:12.840,0:02:15.380
And now that you have received this prophecy,

0:02:15.400,0:02:21.320
God Almighty has brought  breakthrough, reconciliation and also healing in your life.

0:02:21.320,0:02:24.640
Yes I believe, because since the man of God called me out,

0:02:24.640,0:02:27.680
I know that my problem is over.

0:02:27.680,0:02:32.640
Amen, we thank Jesus Christ for the wonderful prophecy you have received today.

0:02:32.640,0:02:35.280
Today is your divine appointment with Jesus Christ.

0:02:35.280,0:02:39.660
And we believe that your way has been opened.

0:02:39.660,0:02:43.660
We want to encourage you, to make God's Word the standard for your life,

0:02:43.660,0:02:46.480
so that you can maintain the wonderful healing that you are about to receive

0:02:46.480,0:02:49.340
and the reconciliation, in Jesus' name.

0:02:49.340,0:02:50.300
Amen

0:02:50.300,0:02:53.980
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:02:53.980,0:02:59.780
My name is Jane Udensi. I come from Anambra state, Nigeria.

0:02:59.780,0:03:03.100
Last Sunday the man of God prophesied that there was a woman there

0:03:03.100,0:03:09.900
who had left her husband for more than two months now.

0:03:09.900,0:03:17.860
The woman was wearing a necklace and wanted to reconcile with her husband but he refused.

0:03:17.860,0:03:20.880
Then I came out.

0:03:20.880,0:03:28.000
He sent me away because since we got married, we have not had children and there was no affection.

0:03:28.000,0:03:33.960
He also said I had a spiritual husband that had been tormenting him in his dreams.

0:03:33.960,0:03:38.840
He said that I was an ogbanje (witch) and was causing him to be sick.

0:03:38.840,0:03:43.980
I think reasonably, we should hear from our brother.

0:03:43.980,0:03:48.780
My name is Ogochukwu Udensi. I came from Anambra state, Nigeria.

0:03:48.780,0:03:59.580
It's true that I sent my wife away because since we married, there has been no child.

0:03:59.580,0:04:08.200
There has been no affection because my wife had a spiritual husband

0:04:08.200,0:04:13.280
that had been tormenting me in my dreams.

0:04:13.280,0:04:16.820
He would carry a gun, or knife and pursue me.

0:04:16.820,0:04:19.100
He came physically?

0:04:19.160,0:04:21.340
No. In dreams, Man of God.

0:04:21.340,0:04:25.280
How? Tell us how he came in the dream!

0:04:25.280,0:04:32.100
He would carry a gun. Sometimes, he would carry a knife and I would run.

0:04:32.100,0:04:37.640
The spiritual husband resembled my wife, and pursued me with a gun.

0:04:37.660,0:04:42.420
How did you know that it was your wife that turned into a spiritual husband?

0:04:42.420,0:04:51.740
Because I could see her face.

0:04:51.740,0:04:54.680
That is why you pursued her out?

0:04:54.680,0:04:57.200
Yes. It is true, Man of God.

0:04:57.200,0:05:04.080
He said the reason why he pursued the woman out, the marriage collapsed

0:05:04.080,0:05:12.280
because he used to see this woman in the dream coming to attack him with a gun, weapon,

0:05:12.280,0:05:16.400
and he always found himself running.

0:05:16.400,0:05:21.340
In real life, did your wife use to pursue you?

0:05:21.340,0:05:22.360
No

0:05:22.360,0:05:27.380
Your wife cannot stand you in the physical. Then, why are you running in the dream?

0:05:27.380,0:05:29.840
And you know it is your wife. Why can't you wait for her?

0:05:29.840,0:05:32.060
Because she wanted to kill me.

0:05:32.060,0:05:34.480
That is why I ran.

0:05:34.480,0:05:37.300
Both of them need deliverance.

0:05:37.300,0:05:46.460
And after the deliverance, he will know that he is more of an enemy than friend to his wife.

0:05:46.460,0:05:50.000
And the wife too is more of an enemy than friend.

0:05:50.000,0:05:51.460
Do you listen to me?

0:05:51.460,0:05:52.800
I will repeat again.

0:05:52.800,0:05:59.920
You are more of an enemy than a friend to your wife. Your wife is more of an enemy than friend to you.

0:05:59.920,0:06:04.920
So who is a witch, who is a wizard now?

0:06:04.920,0:06:12.380
If the wife is a witch, he himself is a wizard.

0:06:12.380,0:06:18.680
Please tell him: If truly the wife is a witch, he himself is a wizard.

0:06:18.680,0:06:21.260
That is all. The two of them need deliverance.

0:06:21.260,0:06:22.140
Thank you.

0:06:22.140,0:06:30.300
They are husband and wife. This is a marriage from God.

0:06:30.300,0:06:36.360
