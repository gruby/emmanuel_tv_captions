There is a young couple - your wife beats you all the time.

0:00:05.880,0:00:06.920
Come out.

0:00:15.220,0:00:17.100
My name is Ogbe Emmanuel.

0:00:17.100,0:00:22.240
I'm the one the man of God prophesied about that his wife always beats him.

0:00:22.240,0:00:28.620
Each time I and my wife have a little quarrel or I want to correct her,

0:00:28.620,0:00:30.180
she will not listen to me.

0:00:30.180,0:00:34.700
Just a little correction - she would beat me.

0:00:34.700,0:00:41.280
Two months ago, she beat me on the mouth and blood started gushing out.

0:00:41.280,0:00:44.580
She does not have affection for me.

0:00:44.580,0:00:50.820
Since I married her in 2015, I have never felt like a married man.

0:00:50.820,0:00:53.100
How does a married man feel?

0:00:53.100,0:00:55.440
They feel happy with their wives.

0:00:55.440,0:00:57.340
Prophecy Time

0:00:57.340,0:00:59.140
So, she used to beat you.

0:00:59.140,0:01:00.820
Yes. Very well, Man of God.

0:01:00.820,0:01:03.080
My name is Obiora Edith.

0:01:03.080,0:01:05.140
You used to beat your husband.

0:01:05.140,0:01:09.300
Yes, whenever I am angry, I slap him.

0:01:09.300,0:01:11.300
Prophecy Time

0:01:11.300,0:01:17.140
Most of the time, I get angry when I am close to him. I don't know why.

0:01:17.140,0:01:20.340
Get close to him and see whether you will be angry.

Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:31.940,0:01:38.260
Our names are Mr and Mrs Obiora Emmanuel.

0:01:38.260,0:01:47.320
We thank God for the deliverance that God has given us last week, Sunday.

0:01:47.320,0:01:56.040
Last week Sunday, during the mass prayer, the man of God prophesied and pointed to my area.

0:01:56.040,0:02:02.340
He said there was a young people over there and the wife always beats the man.

0:02:02.340,0:02:07.920
Prophecy Testimony

0:02:07.920,0:02:15.260
I thought about it for a minute because I knew what was happening in my home.

0:02:15.260,0:02:19.020
Immediately, I jumped up from my seat.

0:02:19.020,0:02:22.760
You are so happy, laughing and smiling today.

0:02:22.760,0:02:25.900
Yes, I'm very happy because I know that I'm free.

0:02:25.900,0:02:29.720
Prophecy Testimony

0:02:29.720,0:02:32.600
The man of God said that we are young.

0:02:32.600,0:02:40.740
As you can see, I'm young and my wife is very, very young as well.

0:02:40.740,0:02:56.960
I married in the year 2015 and to be frank with you, just as I tried to explain to the man of God,

0:02:56.960,0:03:03.640
I never tasted what you would call a happy home.

0:03:03.640,0:03:11.260
Before I married my wife, I was brought up in a Christian home

0:03:11.260,0:03:15.100
and always tried to follow the laws of God.

0:03:15.100,0:03:19.000
I prepared myself for this marriage.

0:03:19.000,0:03:22.080
There were many women and girls around me

0:03:22.080,0:03:29.840
but I separated myself from them for one year in order to look for a good partner.

0:03:29.840,0:03:32.540
I remembered this fine, beautiful lady over here.

0:03:32.540,0:03:37.620
I decided to give her a phone call.

0:03:37.620,0:03:43.720
I called her for the first time and asked her, "Will you marry me? Can you be my wife?"

0:03:43.720,0:03:49.920
I married my wife and trouble started.

0:03:49.920,0:03:57.500
At the time, my wife was just a young lady; she had just finished secondary school.

0:03:57.500,0:04:05.740
As we moved into our house, she would be on social media, always with her phone - busy.

0:04:05.740,0:04:11.020
She had no time for me and I talked to her about it.

0:04:11.020,0:04:21.340
I asked her to leave the phone for some time so we could talk and reason as husband and wife.

0:04:21.340,0:04:25.960
I begged her but she refused to listen.

0:04:25.960,0:04:31.280
I told her that what she was doing, I also knew how to do it very well.

0:04:31.280,0:04:35.600
If I started my own, it would be fire.

0:04:35.600,0:04:41.680
She refused; I gave her time to stop but she refused so then, I started my own.

0:04:41.680,0:04:47.680
I brought out my new phone, downloaded WhatsApp, social media and Facebook.

0:04:47.680,0:04:54.940
See friend requests from ladies - fine ones.

0:04:54.940,0:04:57.960
As I started my own, it became fire.

0:04:57.960,0:05:01.260
Nobody was listening to each other anymore.

0:05:01.260,0:05:03.860
Ok, let me forget that one.

0:05:03.860,0:05:06.520
This happened immediately after we got married.

0:05:06.520,0:05:08.240
More especially this year.

0:05:08.240,0:05:14.540
That's when I developed another habit of drinking alcohol.

0:05:14.540,0:05:24.900
What caused that was too much disrespect - beating me in the sense that I could not talk.

0:05:24.900,0:05:28.740
If I talked once, she would reply me twenty times.

0:05:28.740,0:05:37.040
If I tried to calm her down as a husband and come near her to ask what the problem was,

0:05:37.040,0:05:40.580
she would slap me.

0:05:40.580,0:05:45.980
I thank God for being in The SCOAN today because I have been yearning to come here

0:05:45.980,0:05:50.160
because I knew the man of God was the only one who could solve this problem.

0:05:50.160,0:05:52.300
I thank God for what happened last Sunday.

0:05:52.300,0:05:57.160
After the prophecy, I'm very happy with my wife.

0:05:57.160,0:06:01.940
Yesterday as we were walking, she held my hand.

0:06:01.940,0:06:11.300
Prophecy Testimony

0:06:11.300,0:06:14.860
Can you demonstrate what you are saying.

0:06:14.860,0:06:16.180
Like this.

0:06:16.180,0:06:17.920
You mean, it was strange?

0:06:17.920,0:06:19.720
It was strange.

0:06:19.720,0:06:24.820
And she was not looking ashamed; she was just focusing on me.

0:06:24.820,0:06:27.520
Prophecy Testimony

0:06:27.520,0:06:28.900
And you can see now...

0:06:28.900,0:06:31.360
If you saw how we were sitting there,

0:06:31.360,0:06:37.240
when she got tired, she would rest her head on my shoulder.

0:06:37.240,0:06:38.840
I'm very happy.

0:06:38.840,0:06:41.320
So you mean, she never used to do all this before?

0:06:41.320,0:06:43.680
All these things - before, I did not deserve them.

0:06:43.680,0:06:45.060
Instead it was beating...

0:06:45.060,0:06:53.160
Yes, if she mistakenly did this and then realised it, she would say, "No, you don't deserve it!"

0:06:53.160,0:06:57.340
But I thank God today that I deserve all this.

0:06:57.340,0:06:58.680
Amen.

Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:03.440,0:07:06.980
Our names are Mr and Mrs Obiora Emmanuel.

0:07:06.980,0:07:10.040
Last Sunday, the man of God gave us a prophecy.

0:07:10.040,0:07:13.360
It was after the mass prayer; I was sitting on the chair,

0:07:13.360,0:07:17.120
resting my head on the chair in front of me

0:07:17.120,0:07:21.960
when I heard, "There is a couple here. The wife always beats".

0:07:21.960,0:07:26.620
I was like, "Who does that?" I raised up my head to know who the person was.

0:07:26.620,0:07:31.360
Then I looked beside me and found out that my husband was no longer

0:07:31.360,0:07:35.940
sitting beside me - so it was me.

0:07:35.940,0:07:42.220
I was telling myself, "I'm not going out, unless all the ushers will come and carry me out.

0:07:42.220,0:07:46.520
I can't see myself standing here. For what now?"

0:07:46.520,0:07:51.520
I don't know what made me to just carry my bag.

0:07:51.520,0:07:55.980
The two couples sitting next to me - they were big, heavy -

0:07:55.980,0:07:58.300
before one could pass them, one would have to say, "Excuse me".

0:07:58.300,0:08:02.340
I found out that the space was big for me to pass.

0:08:02.340,0:08:07.480
When I came to the front, that is when I realised where I was.

0:08:07.480,0:08:12.620
I became more angry like "What is this man saying?"

0:08:12.620,0:08:15.820
I was so angry at my husband again.

0:08:15.820,0:08:24.340
After the prayer last Sunday, I now see my husband as my husband, unlike before.

0:08:24.340,0:08:27.800
Whenever I was close to him, I was always sweating; I don't know why.

0:08:27.800,0:08:30.760
Even if it was under aircondition, I would always sweat.

0:08:30.760,0:08:34.340
One day I asked him, "Don't you think it was a mistake getting married to you?

0:08:34.340,0:08:38.000
See how I am sweating when I'm together with you - imagine that".

0:08:38.000,0:08:40.380
And then he said, "You are not normal".

0:08:40.380,0:08:43.220
And then I realised, truly, I wasn't normal

0:08:43.220,0:08:48.420
because I had a spiritual husband, which I knew.

0:08:48.420,0:08:51.180
I kept praying.

0:08:51.180,0:08:55.560
I thank God that after everything, I came here and I was delivered.

0:08:55.560,0:08:57.320
Praise be to the Lord Jesus!

0:08:57.320,0:08:59.080
How did you beat your husband?

0:08:59.080,0:09:05.800
Whenever I was angry - everything he did was negative; I didn't see anything positive in him.

0:09:05.800,0:09:08.980
Only when he was not around, I would be seeing good.

0:09:08.980,0:09:11.420
I would think, "This man is really a good man".

0:09:11.420,0:09:14.780
But whenever he came back...

0:09:14.780,0:09:19.040
I would be seeing another person.

0:09:19.040,0:09:26.140
Whenever he was talking to me, I would think, "Why is he giving me this advice".

0:09:26.140,0:09:32.740
Instead of listening to his advice, I would be remembering all I had gone through

0:09:32.740,0:09:35.600
and I would just be like, "Leave me alone!

0:09:35.600,0:09:37.880
I would just slap him - I would not know where the hand hit him.

0:09:37.880,0:09:40.960
Sometimes I would not even know that I beat him; I would ask, "Did I hit you?"

0:09:40.960,0:09:42.320
He would say, "No, you didn't hit me".

0:09:42.320,0:09:45.400
I thank God for today. Thank you, Man of God.
