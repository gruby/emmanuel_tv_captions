During a Sunday Service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message

0:00:07.080,0:00:14.120
in which he referred to February as being a peculiar month in the Southern African subregion.

0:00:14.120,0:00:16.780
These were his words...

0:00:16.780,0:00:24.280
Ending of February - very peculiar month in the Southern African subregion.

0:00:24.280,0:00:26.700
I will not say more than that.

0:00:26.700,0:00:31.000
It means they have to be steadfast in prayer.

0:00:31.000,0:00:41.420
Ending of February is a peculiar month in the Southern African subregion.

0:00:41.420,0:00:49.140
Let us observe prayer sessions in the beginning for the leaders.

0:00:49.140,0:00:52.720
Ending of February to April.

0:00:52.720,0:00:55.780
That is, from the ending of February to April.

0:00:55.780,0:00:58.980
Let us observe prayer sessions.

0:00:58.980,0:01:04.920
I will let you know of further messages as they are revealed to me.
