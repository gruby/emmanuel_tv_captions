0:00:00.000,0:00:02.740
My name is Utuofon David Udo.

0:00:02.740,0:00:05.960
I am a student of the University of Calabar.

0:00:05.960,0:00:10.960
I have difficulty in walking because I sustained an accident.

0:00:10.960,0:00:14.860
I had a fracture on my ankle when I was driving to school.

0:00:14.860,0:00:16.800
Ok, you are a student of where?

0:00:16.800,0:00:18.500
The University of Calabar.

0:00:18.500,0:00:21.280
You mean you are still an undergraduate?

0:00:21.280,0:00:22.520
Yes.

0:00:22.520,0:00:26.180
When you are healed now, you will double your hair.

0:00:26.180,0:00:31.620
When you see them today - undergraduates - they begin to live as if they are working-class people.

0:00:31.620,0:00:35.160
If you now become working class, what will you put on?

0:00:35.160,0:00:37.700
This is the problem we are facing today.

0:00:37.700,0:00:39.220
Time for everything.

0:00:39.220,0:00:41.920
Can we say that our parents, after giving us the school fees,

0:00:41.920,0:00:46.940
they should give us extra money to do our hair?

0:00:46.940,0:00:49.380
This is the time to talk to her.

0:00:49.380,0:00:52.640
After healing now, you can't talk to her.

0:00:52.640,0:01:01.120
That is when you will see this.

0:01:01.120,0:01:02.260
Did you listen to me?

0:01:02.260,0:01:04.220
Yes.

0:01:04.220,0:01:07.040
You cannot read with this; it's not possible.

0:01:07.040,0:01:10.700
Promise - you have to cut your coat according to your size.

0:01:10.700,0:01:11.500
Yes.

0:01:11.500,0:01:15.300
What are you looking for? You are a beautiful girl already.

0:01:15.300,0:01:20.180
But with this one now, you look ugly.

0:01:20.180,0:01:23.080
Remove it, you will see your beauty, okay?

0:01:23.080,0:01:23.660
Yes.

0:01:23.660,0:01:27.460
Thank you. I think God wants me to talk to you, that is why you have this challenge.

0:01:27.460,0:01:30.840
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:01:30.840,0:01:32.780
Come on! Remove it!

0:01:32.780,0:01:38.340
As Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to offer prayer to Miss Udo, he instructs one of the evangelists,

0:01:38.340,0:01:42.780
to remove the ankle brace on her leg.

0:01:42.780,0:01:44.720
This is operation.

0:01:44.720,0:01:48.940
Yes, I have had three surgeries - two in Nigeria, one in India.

0:01:48.940,0:01:53.740
And you still carry this one?

0:01:53.740,0:01:57.400
You have to make God proud.

0:01:57.400,0:02:02.360
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the complete healing

0:02:02.360,0:02:06.540
of Miss Udo's ankle on which she had had three surgeries.

0:02:06.540,0:02:09.160
He tells her to rise up on her feet.

0:02:09.160,0:02:15.300
Look here.

0:02:15.300,0:02:16.800
Come on.

0:02:16.800,0:02:30.120
Healed In Jesus' name

0:02:30.120,0:02:35.520
Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!

0:02:35.520,0:02:38.500
Thank You, Jesus! My sister can walk!

0:02:38.500,0:02:44.140
The power of God has touched her life and she is able to walk again without the ankle brace.

0:02:44.140,0:02:45.620
Halleluyah!

0:02:45.620,0:02:50.940
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:50.940,0:02:58.220
We want the lady to come forward and share her wonderful testimony to the glory of God.

0:02:58.220,0:03:02.620
Yes, we can see the glory of God radiating in the life of the sister.

0:03:02.620,0:03:04.380
Wow! To God be the glory!

0:03:04.380,0:03:08.020
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:03:08.020,0:03:13.400
My name is Utotofon David. I am a student of the University of Calabar.

0:03:13.400,0:03:21.840
What brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of difficulty in walking.

0:03:21.840,0:03:34.100
I sustained a fracture of the tibia bone and left bone in a car accident in 2014 - 4th July to be precise.

0:03:34.100,0:03:39.720
I was in a car with my friend; we were driving, coming back from school.

0:03:39.720,0:03:49.660
And then we hit the biggest roundabout in Calabar and we jumped over to the other side of the road.

0:03:49.660,0:03:54.620
When we came out of the car, I discovered that I couldn't walk.

0:03:54.620,0:04:01.460
I tried to take 2 or 3 steps; I saw my leg was already swelling up and I could not walk.

0:04:01.460,0:04:06.380
So passersby took us in and took us to the hospital.

0:04:06.380,0:04:12.900
They sent for my mother. When she came, she was scared of surgery.

0:04:12.900,0:04:19.560
When she heard the fact that I was supposed to undergo an operation, she was afraid.

0:04:19.560,0:04:24.800
So she took me out from the hospital; and then she took me home.

0:04:24.800,0:04:32.500
She took me to a traditional bonesetter to try to fix my leg.

0:04:32.500,0:04:39.600
After some couple of weeks, there was still no solution and so we decided to go for the operation

0:04:39.600,0:04:42.320
that she had opted out initially.

0:04:42.320,0:04:50.760
When we went to the hospital, the doctor said, it was a little bit too late for the bone situation.

0:04:50.760,0:04:56.980
But he was still going to do the surgery. Then he operated on me the first time.

0:04:56.980,0:05:01.020
I was still having pains. There was no solution.

0:05:01.020,0:05:07.960
I went to another hospital, still in Abuja, Nigeria, and had another surgery.

0:05:07.960,0:05:10.560
There was still no solution.

0:05:10.560,0:05:16.360
So she took me to a hospital outside Nigeria; that is, in India.

0:05:16.360,0:05:22.860
They operated on me the third time, and we stayed there for three months,

0:05:22.860,0:05:26.660
so they could follow up on their physical therapies and everything.

0:05:26.660,0:05:30.700
But still there was no solution. So I got back home.

0:05:30.700,0:05:36.940
I have been going to rehabilitation centers, different places just to get a solution

0:05:36.940,0:05:40.080
but there was no solution.

0:05:40.080,0:05:46.260
It affected me in several ways. I couldn't take a shower on my own.

0:05:46.260,0:05:49.300
My siblings were the ones doing these things for me.

0:05:49.300,0:05:54.440
When they were back to school, it was my mother who would be doing those things for me.

0:05:54.440,0:05:59.320
It affected me so much in school that I had to write to my department

0:05:59.320,0:06:03.880
that they should please pardon me to write exams.

0:06:03.880,0:06:08.340
I was not even able to attend 70% of the lecture time

0:06:08.340,0:06:12.420
that is recommended for students to attend before writing exams.

0:06:12.420,0:06:17.040
They asked me to suspend my schooling until I would be totally healed.

0:06:17.040,0:06:22.840
But I could not because that was the only thing I could hold onto.

0:06:22.840,0:06:30.920
I didn't really want to be depressed due to doing nothing so they accepted it; they granted my request.

0:06:30.920,0:06:37.380
So I only went there to write exams or for some seminars.

0:06:37.380,0:06:43.460
I couldn't attend day-to-day lectures throughout this period when I was having this problem.

0:06:43.460,0:06:47.100
Tell us, why were you not able to attend the lectures? Why?

0:06:47.100,0:06:53.560
Because I couldn't walk to the lecture halls or run around as a student in school or for anything.

0:06:53.560,0:06:59.740
I was really in pains and my legs would be swelling up all the time so I could not make it.

0:06:59.740,0:07:08.180
I started watching Emmanuel TV where we were lodging for the very last surgery I had to undergo.

0:07:08.180,0:07:12.620
So I said to my mother that, I have been watching this TV,

0:07:12.620,0:07:16.920
and  I have seen what the man of God has been doing in people's lives.

0:07:16.920,0:07:21.880
We had gone virtually everywhere. She had done everything as a mother

0:07:21.880,0:07:27.040
to make sure that I was ok but everything was still the same.

0:07:27.040,0:07:34.220
That I would like to come here to Lagos, and come to The SCOAN

0:07:34.220,0:07:37.400
so that I can have my permanent solution.

0:07:37.400,0:07:40.960
And so she asked how I was going to come here,

0:07:40.960,0:07:46.600
because during that time, she had been following me to all the hospitals for months;

0:07:46.600,0:07:51.720
she had been staying away from her place of work and she had big problems.

0:07:51.720,0:07:57.840
She was queried or something that she had stayed away from work for so long, for some months.

0:07:57.840,0:08:00.980
So she said she could not come with me anymore

0:08:00.980,0:08:04.020
because she was already having problems at her place of work.

0:08:04.020,0:08:07.840
How was I going to come to The SCOAN?

0:08:07.840,0:08:11.680
So she called her sister and explained the situation.

0:08:11.680,0:08:16.360
So her sister send her son that could bring me to Lagos.

0:08:16.360,0:08:22.720
That was how we came to The SCOAN.

0:08:22.720,0:08:26.700
So tell us - what happened on that day?

0:08:26.700,0:08:36.300
When I came to The SCOAN last week, before the man of God even prayed for me,

0:08:36.300,0:08:42.780
he did something that only a loving father would do to his children.

0:08:42.780,0:08:44.880
He advised me.

0:08:44.880,0:08:50.000
Miss Ututofon David & Family
Healing Testimony

0:08:50.000,0:08:56.540
He corrected me on some things and I promised him I was going to keep to his advice.

0:08:56.540,0:08:59.080
And that is why I'm looking like this today.

0:08:59.080,0:09:03.680
Miss Ututofon David & Family
Healing Testimony

0:09:03.680,0:09:09.640
Ok, tell us once again. What was the correction he gave to you?

0:09:09.640,0:09:15.160
He said I should cut my coat according to my size as a student.

0:09:15.160,0:09:24.860
That I should remove the wig that was on my hair and I should just live as a student.

0:09:24.860,0:09:29.860
Yes, to live the life of Christ so that you can be able to assimilate as a student

0:09:29.860,0:09:32.820
and live in the righteous way of the Lord.

0:09:32.820,0:09:37.940
So now, how has that advice improved your life?

0:09:37.940,0:09:44.780
I discovered that I didn't even need them anymore. I mean I have my own hair.

0:09:44.780,0:09:50.820
I didn't need to attach anything to it any more. So, the advice - it's really good.

0:09:50.820,0:09:53.960
And I can also share it to my friends.

0:09:53.960,0:10:00.260
Wow, to God be the glory. Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus!

0:10:00.260,0:10:02.300
We thank God Almighty that you have taken to that advice

0:10:02.300,0:10:06.000
and we can really see in you the glory of God.

0:10:06.000,0:10:09.400
Even looking at you now, one can see the glory of God

0:10:09.400,0:10:15.360
and the beauty of God in your life as you are looking naturally as God has created you.

0:10:15.360,0:10:17.480
Continue with your testimony.

0:10:17.480,0:10:22.340
So on that day when the man of God came to you, what happened?

0:10:22.340,0:10:32.040
I remember when I was watching Emmanuel TV in April on the resurrection morning -

0:10:32.040,0:10:38.980
that was on a Sunday - I had a dream. In that dream, I saw myself.

0:10:38.980,0:10:44.540
I was still very sick and couldn't walk and so my mother here and my elder sister,

0:10:44.540,0:10:50.100
I saw them carrying me. That I should come as there was somebody that was healing people.

0:10:50.100,0:10:53.460
That I had been in that situation for too long. That I should come.

0:10:53.460,0:10:59.660
And so they carried me - one by the left shoulder and one by the right shoulder.

0:10:59.660,0:11:04.460
They took me to a particular room and said, "Just wait, be patient, be of good courage,

0:11:04.460,0:11:10.120
it will be your turn". And so I was waiting; I was laying on a mat.

0:11:10.120,0:11:14.800
Suddenly, I heard my name. I said, "Mummy, they are calling me". She said, "Yes".

0:11:14.800,0:11:24.960
And so they took me. When I reached the hall, it was Prophet T.B. Joshua who was there.

0:11:24.960,0:11:31.800
He stood at a distance from me and just said to me, "Be healed!"

0:11:31.800,0:11:35.140
And then right from that moment when he said, "Be healed",

0:11:35.140,0:11:42.880
I experienced a sensation from my waist down, it was a shocking sensation.

0:11:42.880,0:11:48.040
That was the sensation that woke me up to reality.

0:11:48.040,0:11:53.360
So that was a spiritual manifestation of your healing, your miracle that happened.

0:11:53.360,0:11:56.840
So now tell us - what happened on that day when you now physically met

0:11:56.840,0:11:59.040
the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:11:59.040,0:12:05.320
When I woke up, I told my mother about it when she came back from church.

0:12:05.320,0:12:12.520
She told me that though she didn't believe in dreams but what she could tell me as a mother was

0:12:12.520,0:12:17.420
that though my faith could not carry what I had just seen in the dream, her suggestion would be that

0:12:17.420,0:12:24.000
I should come to The SCOAN so that I could meet with the man of God,

0:12:24.000,0:12:29.460
so that my healing could come to reality since my faith could not take me.

0:12:29.460,0:12:35.620
When I came to Tthe SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.

0:12:35.620,0:12:40.980
As soon as he prayed for me, he told me to walk and I started walking to the glory of God.

0:12:40.980,0:12:47.400
Wow! Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!

0:12:47.400,0:12:50.300
So you mean, as the man of God came to you and prayed for you

0:12:50.300,0:12:54.640
and told you to stand up and walk, you found herself walking.

0:12:54.640,0:12:59.180
What you could not do before, you found yourself doing it, to the glory of God,

0:12:59.180,0:13:04.860
Yes. Even that day when I came, I was being supported by my brother there.

0:13:04.860,0:13:11.120
I was still limping, obviously. But as soon as he told me to walk, I started walking.

0:13:11.120,0:13:14.720
And right now, I can even walk much more better.

0:13:14.720,0:13:20.460
Wow. Shall we put our hands together once again for Jesus!

0:13:20.460,0:13:24.000
Wow. To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.

0:13:24.000,0:13:29.540
Can you demonstrate to us what you can do now, what you could not do before but now you can do,

0:13:29.540,0:13:34.080
after the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in your life.

0:13:34.080,0:13:40.080
Before, I couldn't walk without limping. If I walked, it would be so obvious  that I was limping.

0:13:40.080,0:13:45.100
But now, I can walk very well, and you wouldn't know anything. I give God the glory.

0:13:45.100,0:13:46.180
Thank You, Jesus!

0:13:46.180,0:13:50.120
Wow. To God be the glory.

0:13:50.120,0:13:53.740
On that day, we saw you with an ankle brace.

0:13:53.740,0:13:55.780
Are you still using the ankle brace?

0:13:55.780,0:13:58.420
No, I don't need the ankle brace anymore.

0:13:58.420,0:14:02.640
You don't need it anymore. Now you can do the things you could not do before,

0:14:02.640,0:14:05.000
to the glory of God. Wow, to God be the glory.

0:14:05.000,0:14:09.680
We thank God Almighty for His miracle in your life and as you can see on the screen,

0:14:09.680,0:14:15.140
we can see the day when the man of God prayed for her and God Almighty healed her

0:14:15.140,0:14:19.300
from the problem she was having, to the glory of God.

0:14:19.300,0:14:24.560
We can even see now that you are putting on shoes. Can we see?

0:14:24.560,0:14:28.960
Could you do all this before? Could you put on shoes like this and walk around?

0:14:28.960,0:14:30.640
No I couldn't.

0:14:30.640,0:14:35.280
But now you can do them to the glory of God which shows the mightiness of God in your life.

0:14:35.280,0:14:36.520
To God be the glory.

0:14:36.520,0:14:40.380
What advice do you have for people listening to you

0:14:40.380,0:14:44.880
because many people are also in the same condition that you were in before,

0:14:44.880,0:14:49.120
and they don't know how to go about it. What advice do you have for them?

0:14:49.120,0:14:54.100
My advice to people that are in this situation, especially to the young people, is

0:14:54.100,0:14:57.820
that after trying everything you think you can do -

0:14:57.820,0:15:02.440
I mean God's wisdom starts from where human knowledge stops.

0:15:02.440,0:15:09.460
So I advise every young person to run to God - to come to The SCOAN if you can.

0:15:09.460,0:15:15.380
But if you can't, watch Emmanuel TV, listen to the man of God and then do what he says you should do.

0:15:15.380,0:15:19.820
And then you will have your healing miracle or whatever you expect from God.

Healing Testimony

0:16:31.280,0:16:37.600
The woman standing beside me is my mother and the man standing beside me is my brother.

0:16:37.600,0:16:39.820
My mother's sister's son - he is my brother.

0:16:39.820,0:16:44.100
Ok. Can we just hear a few words from your mother.

0:16:44.100,0:16:50.880
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:16:50.880,0:16:57.000
Brethren, I want to thank God. I am not going to narrate the whole story again.

0:16:57.000,0:17:05.360
The young beautiful angel standing beside me is my second daughter from a family of five.

0:17:05.360,0:17:12.260
You know what it means for a young girl to have an accident - since 2014.

0:17:12.260,0:17:19.460
All I am saying now is that God has done it for me, in the name of Jesus.

0:17:19.460,0:17:27.360
God has done it so that I no longer have to carry her, carry water to her, do everything for her.

0:17:27.360,0:17:33.200
I mean, this accident did a lot of things to me - even the hypertension that I am having now,

0:17:33.200,0:17:35.600
at my place of work, everything.

0:17:35.600,0:17:38.720
It was because of the accident, running here and there.

0:17:38.720,0:17:47.640
I can remember one day that I was going to give a letter to the HOD in the University of Calabar.

0:17:47.640,0:17:54.460
As I was going, the BP started going up. I asked the driver to stop.

0:17:54.460,0:17:57.960
He said, "Madam, what happened?" I said, "I can't continue on this journey".

0:17:57.960,0:18:02.900
He asked, "Why?" I said, "Please stop. Where I am going to is far but here is nearer.

0:18:02.900,0:18:05.020
Let me just go back to the house".

0:18:05.020,0:18:07.660
I got off, after I had payed the money.

0:18:07.660,0:18:12.340
It went on like that. Till even when we travelled.

0:18:12.340,0:18:17.000
So, finally today - as I said, I am not going to narrate any story,

0:18:17.000,0:18:21.080
but all I'm saying is that God has done it for me.

0:18:21.080,0:18:28.640
And I want to thank God for this church, The SCOAN and the prophet, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:18:28.640,0:18:34.120
God is using him and God should keep him so that he will continue this work.

0:18:34.120,0:18:39.440
I cannot reward him, but I know that our Heavenly Father is a Rewarder

0:18:39.440,0:18:44.740
and He says in His Word that He will reward those who seek diligently for Him.

0:18:44.740,0:18:48.360
And I know that He will reward him, in Jesus' name.

0:18:48.360,0:18:52.740
We thank God Almighty for the glorious testimony that has been shared by your daughter.

0:18:52.740,0:18:58.160
Shall we put our hands together once again for Jesus Christ!

0:18:58.160,0:19:02.120
We thank God Almighty, sister, for what the Lord has done in your life.

0:19:02.120,0:19:06.960
We just want to enjoin and employ you that now that you have been healed and set free,

0:19:06.960,0:19:09.740
you should go and make God's Word the standard for your life

0:19:09.740,0:19:12.680
and let your way be channelled by the Word of God.

0:19:12.680,0:19:16.240
Remember, the healing that you have received is not an end in itself

0:19:16.240,0:19:20.860
but  a means to an end which is the salvation of your soul.

0:19:20.860,0:19:21.400
Amen.
