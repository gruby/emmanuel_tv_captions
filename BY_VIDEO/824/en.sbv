Hi. I’m Gary Hull, a general manager of the newest radio station in Israel - “Voice Of Hope” for all the middle east.

0:05:41.200,0:05:46.460
We are so glad that God has opened His door to give us the place next to the beautiful Sea of Galilee,

0:05:46.460,0:05:52.720
where Jesus walked on the water, so that we bring the people the bread of life throughout all the middle east;

0:05:52.720,0:05:58.840
throughout Lebanon, through Syria and Jordan, and of course throughout the beautiful land of Galilee.

0:05:58.840,0:06:04.920
Our programs are being produced locally, and we are also going to be producing programs for other ministries

0:06:04.920,0:06:10.600
around the world, presenting the gospel of Jesus in the Arabic language to all who would listen.

0:06:10.600,0:06:15.720
We hope to encourage Christians who have lost their homes through sufferings and warfare.

0:06:15.720,0:06:20.400
We hope to encourage others who don't yet know the Lord to come to know the One who can save them

0:06:20.400,0:06:22.000
and give them eternal life.

0:06:22.000,0:06:27.580

0:08:15.780,0:08:16.800
Yes, exactly.

0:08:16.800,0:08:24.700
Pastor Joshua, may I ask, you are known as a Prophet; what is your prophecy for this land?

0:08:24.700,0:08:26.160
That’s why we are here.

0:08:26.160,0:08:28.640
Are we going to have war or peace?

0:08:28.640,0:08:30.220
No, don’t worry, that is why we are here.

0:08:30.220,0:08:31.240
We are here.

0:08:31.240,0:08:34.920
Whatever life brings, we will be here with you.

0:08:34.920,0:08:36.280
So, we are protected now?

0:08:36.280,0:08:37.680
By the grace of God.

0:08:37.680,0:08:44.100
Can you tell us in a few sentences, how did you get your power?

0:08:44.100,0:08:50.240
From my Father, Jesus, who was born in this land.

0:08:50.240,0:08:57.960
I am an inheritance of His grace – the grace of Jesus Christ.

0:08:57.960,0:09:00.840
What was your first prophecy?

0:09:00.840,0:09:04.440
It is not my prophecy; it is God’s prophecy.

0:09:04.440,0:09:10.880
You cure people by chasing the devil or demons out of them;

0:09:10.880,0:09:16.100
are demons here also in this land?

0:09:16.100,0:09:21.500
Demons are responsible for the pain, killing, stealing and destruction.

0:09:21.500,0:09:27.940
My purpose of praying for people is to give them relief,

0:09:27.940,0:09:33.460
to separate them from the demons that are responsible for the pain and affliction.
