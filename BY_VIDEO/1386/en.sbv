0:00:00.000,0:00:04.820
I was sent by Leah's father from Adamawa State.

0:00:04.820,0:00:11.640
This girl was abducted alongside other school girls at Dapchi since 2018.

0:00:11.640,0:00:13.680
Why is the father not here?

0:00:13.680,0:00:16.380
The father is not well; he is traumatised.

0:00:16.380,0:00:17.980
I am his elder brother.

0:00:17.980,0:00:23.380
We want you to pray for us; we have gone to many places to look for help but could not get it.

0:00:23.380,0:00:28.960
We heard about you, that is why we came for your assistance and help.

0:00:28.960,0:00:37.260
I am Yakubu Nkeki, Chairman Of Abducted Chibok Girls' Parents, from Borno State.

0:00:37.260,0:00:39.260
Please, sir, help us!

0:00:39.260,0:00:49.060
The pictures of the girls I'm holding with me - they are 112 Chibok girls that are yet to be released

0:00:49.060,0:00:51.160
in the hands of the captors.

0:00:51.160,0:00:57.320
We have gone to so many places seeking for solution but there was no answer.

0:00:57.320,0:01:04.540
We heard from many people that there is a Prophet, T.B. Joshua, in Lagos

0:01:04.540,0:01:08.280
that is delivering people all over the nation.

0:01:08.280,0:01:13.500
That is why we from Chibok, on behalf of the 112 parents,

0:01:13.500,0:01:17.940
whose daughters have not yet been released came to seek for solution.

0:01:17.940,0:01:24.880
Help us to pray so that the 112 girls in the hands of the captors might be released.

0:01:24.880,0:01:29.680
We believe God will intervene and bring them home safely.

0:01:29.680,0:01:34.480

0:03:45.560,0:03:50.000
In Jesus Christ's name!

0:04:23.100,0:04:25.220
Sir, you are welcome, in Jesus' name.

0:04:25.220,0:04:28.300
Can you please introduce yourself and those who are standing with you.

0:04:28.300,0:04:30.680
My name is Yakubu Nkeki.

0:04:30.680,0:04:35.320
I'm the Chairman of Abducted Chibok Girls' Parents

0:04:35.320,0:04:42.900
that were abducted April 14, 2014 in Chibok local government, Borno State.

0:04:42.900,0:04:49.540
Here standing at my right hand side are the parents of the Chibok girls

0:04:49.540,0:04:53.940
that have not yet been released - 112 girls.

0:04:53.940,0:04:56.420
These are some of the parents.

0:04:56.420,0:04:58.460
Some are still at home.

0:04:58.460,0:05:04.020
We came here because we have visited many different places,

0:05:04.020,0:05:07.380
looking for solution to rescue the remaining girls.

0:05:07.380,0:05:14.380
Initially, they were 276 girls abducted.

0:05:14.380,0:05:22.680
In the process of negotiation, the government were able to rescue 113 girls.

0:05:22.680,0:05:25.860
We know that the government has tried its best.

0:05:25.860,0:05:28.020
Soldiers have tried their best.

0:05:28.020,0:05:31.980
Many soldiers have lost their lives in the process of rescuing these poor girls

0:05:31.980,0:05:33.580
from the hands of their captors.

0:05:33.580,0:05:37.160
We the Chibok girls' parents, appreciate the effort of the government

0:05:37.160,0:05:40.080
but there still remain 112 girls.

0:05:40.080,0:05:44.940
Since 2016, we have not received any credible information about them.

0:05:44.940,0:05:47.420
We have been looking for solution;

0:05:47.420,0:05:55.540
I, personally, have been to different countries: Germany, South Africa and many others.

0:05:55.540,0:06:03.560
We heard that there is a prophet in Lagos called Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:06:03.560,0:06:13.020
who delivers people from the hands of captors, from prison and delivers people from demons.

0:06:13.020,0:06:16.820
And those who are even crippled, walk!

0:06:16.820,0:06:24.780
This is what made us come to represent the parents of the 112 girls from Chibok

0:06:24.780,0:06:28.280
and to pray over these poor girls.

0:06:28.280,0:06:37.560
We know, with the power and miracles we have been seeing, God will bring the solution

0:06:37.560,0:06:42.340
through Prophet T.B. Joshua and God will release them, definitely.

0:06:42.340,0:06:51.380
By Sunday April 14, 2019 these poor girls will be exactly five years in the hands of their captors.

0:06:51.380,0:06:53.960
We do not know the condition they are in now.

0:06:53.960,0:07:02.280
Due to the pain of losing these poor girls, 34 parents also died

0:07:02.280,0:07:04.780
as they refused to eat or drink.

0:07:04.780,0:07:06.480
They were traumatised.

0:07:06.480,0:07:11.220
We believe definitely that the problem of these poor girls will be over

0:07:11.220,0:07:15.860
since we are here in The SCOAN.

0:07:15.860,0:07:23.960
He even ordered the nations to join him in praying for the release of the remaining 112 Chibok girls.

0:07:23.960,0:07:28.220
We believe, definitely they will be released.

0:07:28.220,0:07:37.000
He said that people around the world should fast on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.

0:07:37.000,0:07:41.500
By this, we know that God will intervene.

0:07:41.500,0:07:43.500
My name is Yana Galang.

0:07:43.500,0:07:47.380
I come from Chibok in Borno State, Nigeria.

0:07:47.380,0:07:50.900
The picture of the girl in my hand now is of my own biological daughter,

0:07:50.900,0:07:52.980
by name Rifkatu Galang.

0:07:52.980,0:07:59.660
She is one of the Chibok girls that was abducted on the 14th April 2014 by terrorists.

0:07:59.660,0:08:03.540
She is still with them and I don't know where she is

0:08:03.540,0:08:05.940
and I don't know what her condition is -

0:08:05.940,0:08:10.120
maybe she eats or drinks, I don't know.

0:08:10.120,0:08:16.900
But I know and believe that as we have come here to The SCOAN,

0:08:16.900,0:08:21.820
we believe in God, that God will intervene in this issue,

0:08:21.820,0:08:28.640
that these our children will be released very soon by the grace of God.

0:08:28.640,0:08:33.100
We believe, the faith that has brought them, will see them through

0:08:33.100,0:08:38.260
and these children will come out and they will give a testimony, in Jesus' name.

0:08:38.260,0:08:42.120
The anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent us to you

0:08:42.120,0:08:47.640
that you have come all the way long from Borno State in the Northern part of Nigeria

0:08:47.640,0:08:53.580
and the man of God knows all the expenses that you must have had

0:08:53.580,0:08:56.920
in order to come here today as a group

0:08:56.920,0:09:04.680
and also your accommodation, feeding - the man of God is so much concerned

0:09:04.680,0:09:06.600
and moved by the Spirit of God.

0:09:06.600,0:09:14.100
He said, we should give you the sum of 452,000 Naira.

0:09:14.100,0:09:19.100
This is the sum of 452,000 Naira for all of you

0:09:19.100,0:09:22.280
to cover your transport expenses, feeding, accommodation.

0:09:22.280,0:09:26.260
Also 'The Mirror' book for the salvation of your soul.

0:09:26.260,0:09:39.180
Abducted Chibok Girls' Parents Receive 452,000
Naira From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners

0:09:39.180,0:09:43.520
Thank you very much. We appreciate it.

0:09:43.520,0:09:47.200
May God bless him in abundance.

0:09:47.200,0:09:51.720
We never expected that we would even get close to him

0:09:51.720,0:09:57.040
but he even opened up, shaked hands with us and listened to our problem.

0:09:57.040,0:09:59.060
Thank you very much. We appreciate it.

0:09:59.060,0:10:05.940
And it is just a beginning and it shows that really, our daughters will be back soon.

0:10:05.940,0:10:06.940
Thank you very much.

0:10:06.940,0:10:09.980
I'm Yunana Sharibu.

0:10:09.980,0:10:15.380
I'm the senior brother to Nathaniel Sharibu, the father of Leah.

0:10:15.380,0:10:22.980
The picture in our hand is a picture of Leah Sharibu and her mother.

0:10:22.980,0:10:26.240
Her father cannot be around because he is not well.

0:10:26.240,0:10:28.240
The same applies to the mother.

0:10:28.240,0:10:37.540
Being the senior brother in the family, I decided to represent the family here.

0:10:37.540,0:10:40.740
The man beside me is an uncle to the family.

0:10:40.740,0:10:47.940
He is an evangelist residing in Yola.

0:10:47.940,0:10:54.800
Leah Sharibu has been in captivity since the 19th of April, 2018.

0:10:54.800,0:11:00.980
There were about 119 school girls at Dapchi

0:11:00.980,0:11:05.780
and all of them were returned after some time, with the exception of Leah.

0:11:05.780,0:11:10.640
We have travelled to many places in search for a solution, to get this girl back.

0:11:10.640,0:11:12.360
But all failed.

0:11:12.360,0:11:17.080
So now we heard about Emmanuel TV.

0:11:17.080,0:11:23.120
We came together with the parents of the Chibok abducted girls.

0:11:23.120,0:11:27.920
So Leah has been now one year and two months in captivity.

0:11:27.920,0:11:33.420
I will even start to say my testimony

0:11:33.420,0:11:37.400
because what I have seen today is more or less a testimony to me.

0:11:37.400,0:11:41.680
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent us to present to the family

0:11:41.680,0:11:49.340
the total cash sum of 700,000 Naira.

0:11:49.340,0:11:58.020
That is the total sum of 700,000 Naira by the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:11:58.020,0:12:02.880
and the Emmanuel TV Partners, and this money is to support the parents.

0:12:02.880,0:12:05.620
Out of this money, the man of God has instructed

0:12:05.620,0:12:12.100
that 500,000 Naira cash should be given to the mother and father of Leah

0:12:12.100,0:12:15.580
because of the condition they are in now.

0:12:15.580,0:12:21.180
200,000 Naira for you to take care of your feeding, transportation and accommodation.

0:12:21.180,0:12:24.080
And also 'The Mirror' book for the salvation of your soul.

0:12:24.080,0:12:25.880
He has also sent spiritual items.

0:12:25.880,0:12:27.560
We are very grateful.

0:12:27.560,0:12:31.900
We want to extend our regards and gratitude to the man of God.

0:12:31.900,0:12:34.200
We are very grateful. Thank you very much.
