0:00:09.280,0:00:15.260
When David was brought to the king to defend his cause,

0:00:15.260,0:00:27.980
he simply testified of how God had delivered him, saved him,

0:00:27.980,0:00:39.660
rescued him from the mouth of lion and bear, in his tender age.

0:00:39.780,0:00:54.120
Today, when we come out for the testimony it is nothing but the immediate goodness of God.

0:00:54.120,0:01:03.980
Remember the sickness you had in the past.

0:01:03.980,0:01:08.680
The same sickness others had and died,

0:01:08.680,0:01:15.660
while many others are still on the sickbed.

0:01:15.660,0:01:19.380
Life is in stages.

0:01:23.200,0:01:27.800
No matter how good you are,

0:01:27.800,0:01:32.340
no matter how clever you are,

0:01:32.340,0:01:44.220
there is always another level to reach for.

0:01:49.960,0:02:28.620
Those who are rich in every sense of the word, understand that life is a learning experience.

0:02:28.620,0:02:38.300
When you constantly strive to improve, you build character.

0:02:38.300,0:02:45.480
We Christians enjoy the opportunity to be a coach to others.

0:02:51.960,0:03:01.260
I've come to say how much I love You

0:03:01.260,0:03:10.400
I've come to say how much I adore You

0:03:10.400,0:03:14.300
Lord I'm not here to complain

0:03:14.300,0:03:19.640
About my many problems

0:03:19.640,0:03:24.620
By Your Spirit and Your grace

0:03:24.620,0:03:29.240
I'm confident You'll solve them

0:03:29.340,0:03:34.420
I'm here to say

0:03:34.420,0:03:38.800
I love You

0:03:38.800,0:03:43.520
I'm here to say

0:03:43.520,0:03:48.200
I adore You

0:03:48.280,0:03:53.000
I'm here to say

0:03:53.120,0:03:57.260
I love You

0:03:57.260,0:04:18.320
I love to love You Lord

0:04:18.420,0:04:21.420
You may be seated.

0:04:21.420,0:04:24.860
Hallelujah.

0:04:24.940,0:04:29.180
Today's message: "My testimony".

0:04:34.420,0:04:45.640
We shall watch a documentary on who is T.B.Joshua, and the Synagogue Church of all Nations.

0:04:45.640,0:04:57.240
A lot has been said by people concerning how the church,

0:04:57.240,0:05:02.180
'Synagogue' came into being.

0:05:02.180,0:05:16.380
Some people questioned my foundation, my mentor,

0:05:16.380,0:05:24.680
my educational background and my calling as a man of God.

0:05:24.680,0:05:33.800
I am not showing this documentary because people questioned

0:05:33.900,0:05:44.040
my foundation, my background, my mentor,

0:05:44.040,0:05:51.500
my educational background, my calling as a man of God.

0:05:51.500,0:06:03.000
I am showing it because it is God's time. That is, it is an act of God.

0:06:03.000,0:06:05.980
Stay blessed and watch.

0:06:10.480,0:06:14.340
This is prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer mountain.

0:06:14.420,0:06:22.000
Guided by the Holy Spirit prophet T.B. Joshua came to this prayer mountain to seek the face of God.

0:06:22.100,0:06:27.180
Like prophets of old, he fasted and prayed for forty days and forty nights,

0:06:27.220,0:06:32.380
as prayer and fasting open the door for God to enter.

0:06:32.480,0:06:38.800
It was at this very prayer mountain that prophet T.B. Joshua received divine anointing from God

0:06:38.800,0:06:40.900
to start his ministry.

0:06:40.980,0:06:48.560
As he raises his arms to heaven and then falls to pray, he receives a covenant from God

0:06:48.600,0:06:51.500
concerning his calling.

0:06:51.540,0:06:58.740
Only he and God know the divine message that was revealed to him at that moment.

0:06:58.860,0:07:04.100
Concerning this experience prophet T.B. Joshua said:

0:07:04.240,0:07:07.780
"I was in a trance for three consecutive days.

0:07:07.900,0:07:13.520
Then I saw a hand that pointed a Bible to my heart, and the Bible entered my heart,

0:07:13.600,0:07:18.440
and my heart immersed with the Bible immediately.

0:07:18.500,0:07:25.740
Then the awareness came, and I saw the apostles and prophets of old, with someone whose head I couldn't see

0:07:25.920,0:07:32.840
because He was tall to the Heaven and suspended, which I believe was our Lord - Jesus Christ

0:07:32.840,0:07:35.360
sitting in their midst.

0:07:35.440,0:07:38.080
I also saw myself in their midst.

0:07:38.240,0:07:45.300
After a while I saw a hand of the same tall man, I could not behold His face, which was glittering

0:07:45.300,0:07:47.560
with an unimaginable light.

0:07:47.800,0:07:53.620
But all the apostles - I could see their faces, particularly apostles Peter and Paul,

0:07:53.740,0:07:56.760
prophets Moses, Elijah, and others.

0:07:56.940,0:08:01.100
Their names were boldly written on their chests.

0:08:01.160,0:08:10.200
I heard the voice saying: "I am your God. I am giving you a divine commission to go and carry out the work of the

0:08:10.240,0:08:11.380
Heavenly Father".

0:08:11.440,0:08:18.060
At the same time, the same hand of the tall man gave me a small cross and a big Bible,

0:08:18.140,0:08:25.760
bigger than the one that had entered my heart, with the promise, that as I keep pressing in His time and name,

0:08:25.960,0:08:28.380
I would be given a bigger cross.

0:08:28.480,0:08:33.320
But if I fail the opposite would occur.

0:08:33.440,0:08:41.740
I also heard the voice of the same tall man, that I could not see His head, saying: "I am the Lord your God,

0:08:41.900,0:08:49.280
who was, and who is, Jesus Christ giving orders to all the apostles and prophets.

0:08:49.420,0:08:55.720
The same voice said to me: "I would show you the wonderful ways, I would reveal myself through you,

0:08:55.840,0:09:02.760
in teaching, preaching, miracles, signs and wonders for the salvation of souls.

0:09:02.840,0:09:10.060
Since then I have been receiving my visions every year according to my faithfulness to God.

0:09:10.220,0:09:16.460
A bigger cross means to me more responsibilities.

0:09:16.600,0:09:22.420
The Bible that entered my heart symbolized Spirit and Life - the Holy Spirit.

0:09:22.520,0:09:24.840
God's word is Spirit and Live.

0:09:24.840,0:09:27.360
He does nothing without His Word.

0:09:27.560,0:09:33.080
The book of Romans 8:16 says: "God's Spirit joins Himself to our spirit

0:09:33.240,0:09:36.340
to declare that we are children of God.

0:09:36.480,0:09:43.180
This divine anointing is performed by God Himself on all who have the wonderful privilage

0:09:43.260,0:09:45.360
of becoming His children.

0:09:45.460,0:09:49.880
It accompanies the conversion of those who trust in Christ.

0:09:49.980,0:09:59.020
Paul said that the Spirit dwells in every believer and His presence is the guarantee of our future glory in Heaven,

0:09:59.200,0:10:05.780
according to the book of 2 Corinthians 1:21-22

0:10:05.980,0:10:13.600
As a result of His indwelling presence we have the ability to become more like Christ, in accordance with

0:10:13.620,0:10:18.640
2 Corinthians 3:17-18.

0:10:18.700,0:10:24.680
We who are born of God have no excuse of remaining as we are.

0:10:24.780,0:10:32.660
We can be increasingly conformed to the image of Christ by yielding ourselves to God's anointing,

0:10:32.800,0:10:37.360
the Holy Spirit who dwells in our hearts.

0:10:37.560,0:10:44.480
Father, thank you for Your Spirit. Fill us with His Love and Power,

0:10:44.600,0:10:47.300
Change us into Christs' own image.

0:10:47.300,0:10:51.120
day by day and hour by hour.

0:10:51.280,0:11:00.280
Remember, Father gave us the Spirit to make us like His Son."

0:11:00.440,0:11:03.760
These are the pictures you will bring out and show people.

0:11:03.760,0:11:09.660
By the time the glory of God is revealed to the world and other countries start coming,

0:11:09.820,0:11:12.340
at that time, I will not have the time to come here again. I will have my own prayer mountain.

0:11:12.520,0:11:18.480
The man of God said that by the time the glory of God is revealed in his ministry, and people from other

0:11:18.680,0:11:23.300
countries start coming, he would no longer have the time to visit this prayer mountain,

0:11:23.540,0:11:31.520
and in the future he would have his own prayer mountain.

0:11:31.760,0:11:37.860
This is a picture of prophet T.B. Joshua praying for people after just having returned from a forty days,

0:11:38.020,0:11:41.020
and forty nights fasting at the prayer mountain.

0:11:41.020,0:11:47.820
During the early years of his ministry prophet T.B. Joshua did not have a vehicle to move around.

0:11:47.920,0:11:53.120
He walked almost everywhere he went for two years.

0:11:53.260,0:11:58.180
The children surrounding prophet T.B. Joshua are among those he gathered to follow him,

0:11:58.420,0:12:05.040
as he went to form first Synagogue Church of all Nations.

0:12:09.280,0:12:14.460
This is the first site and the first structure of the Synagogue Church of all Nations,

0:12:14.560,0:12:20.560
where prophet T.B. Joshua have just returned from the prayer mountain, lays the foundation of the church

0:12:20.740,0:12:25.660
located in Agodo-Egbe, Lagos Nigeria.

0:12:25.720,0:12:32.280
Prophet T.B. Joshua walks joyfully among the members as he lifts their faith with the Word of God.

0:12:32.360,0:12:34.800
Amen!

0:12:34.900,0:12:45.360
In fact, I don't know where to start. My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.

0:12:45.360,0:12:55.500
Today, we start the Synagogue here!

0:13:28.420,0:13:32.960
Worshipers gathered at the second church building of the Synagogue Church of all Nations,

0:13:33.180,0:13:42.360
that was built  to accommodate the increasing number of members.

0:13:51.240,0:14:00.260
Prophet T.B. Joshua moves in their midst and prays for them.

0:14:03.880,0:14:09.440
Due to a violent thunderstorm the second church building of the Synagogue Church of all Nations

0:14:09.560,0:14:17.720
was completely destroyed.

0:14:17.900,0:14:22.500
After the second church building was destroyed another building was built,

0:14:22.600,0:14:26.920
this time using the wooden planks.

0:14:26.980,0:14:34.100
The first service was held at the new building of the Synagogue Church of all Nations in 1992.

0:14:34.220,0:14:41.440
The man you are seeing now, although difficult to recognize, is prophet T.B. Joshua at the age of 29,

0:14:41.440,0:14:45.300
ministering to the members.

0:15:18.300,0:15:22.640
This is prophet T.B. Joshua's first crusade in 1992.

0:15:22.640,0:15:28.700
Listen to him as he addresses the people in his local dialect.

0:15:37.980,0:15:42.440
Clap for Jesus.

0:15:46.920,0:15:54.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesies to the people saying; we are in a small crusade now, but in the future

0:15:54.440,0:15:57.360
it is going to be big.

0:15:57.500,0:16:03.300
One might question why a church of just a small number of the outskirts of Lagos Nigeria should become

0:16:03.300,0:16:05.980
the Synagogue Church of all Nations

0:16:06.100,0:16:10.760
But this is a vision God had given to prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:16:25.560,0:16:33.460
Whatever situation you are going through serves a purpose.

0:16:33.460,0:16:43.180
It may be to stop you a while in order to reform you.

0:16:43.180,0:16:48.440
It may be to strengthen your desire.

0:16:48.440,0:16:52.480
Remember the man at the pool of Bethesda.

0:16:52.480,0:16:57.680
It may be to keep you for a new level in life.

0:16:57.800,0:17:07.740
We have seen people who had spent many years in the prison, later reaching the throne.

0:17:17.920,0:17:24.020
This is my song

0:17:24.020,0:17:33.320
Praising my Saviour

0:17:33.360,0:17:39.860
All the day long

0:17:39.980,0:17:48.840
This is my story

0:17:48.840,0:17:56.920
This is my song

0:17:57.060,0:18:07.580
Praising my Saviour

0:18:07.760,0:18:18.780
All the day long

0:18:18.780,0:18:21.900
You may be seated, thank you.

0:18:22.080,0:18:28.880
1 Samuel 17:37

0:18:28.880,0:18:38.680
“The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear,

0:18:38.860,0:18:43.260
will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”

0:18:43.400,0:18:45.320
David said it.

0:18:45.320,0:18:51.620
When David was brought to the king to defend his cause,

0:18:51.620,0:19:04.180
he simply testified of how God had delivered him, saved him,

0:19:04.180,0:19:15.100
rescued him from the mouth of lion and bear, in his tender age.

0:19:15.220,0:19:29.760
Today, when we come out for a testimony, it is nothing but the immediate goodness of God.

0:19:29.760,0:19:39.580
Remember the sickness you had in the past.

0:19:39.580,0:19:44.200
The same sickness others had and died,

0:19:44.200,0:19:50.000
while many others are still on the sickbed.

0:19:50.000,0:19:58.860
Life is in stages.

0:19:58.980,0:20:04.600
Here is prophet T.B. Joshua surveying the church premises after heavy rain,

0:20:04.720,0:20:09.900
had once again caused flooding.

0:20:19.260,0:20:31.080
Prophet T.B. Joshua is carrying a plank of wood to assist in rebuilding the church.

0:20:43.800,0:20:49.480
Prophet T.B. Joshua is packing sand along with members of the church to repair the damage,

0:20:49.480,0:20:57.700
that was caused to the first church's structure, due to the heavy rain storm.

0:21:50.820,0:21:54.960
Due to the increasing number of worshipers attending the church,

0:21:55.180,0:22:00.140
the Holy Spirit instructed prophet T.B. Joshua to move to a new location,

0:22:00.140,0:22:04.260
to accommodate the inflows of new worshipers.

0:22:04.400,0:22:11.180
In 1994 the church moved to Ikotun-Egbe, Lagos Nigeria.

0:22:11.280,0:22:14.760
This is the forth building of the Synagogue Church of all Nations.

0:22:14.840,0:22:20.440
The first building at the new site.

0:22:35.360,0:22:38.640
Thank you Jesus.

0:22:44.540,0:22:53.160
Inside the church are thousands of people joyfully receiving the Word of God.

0:22:53.160,0:22:59.380
After the service the man of God returns by motorcycle to his personal place of sanctuary,

0:22:59.380,0:23:06.100
his own prayer mountain, located 15 minutes from the church.

0:23:06.260,0:23:10.460
Here is prophet T.B. Joshua at the age of 32.

0:23:10.460,0:23:16.560
He was the overseer of the Synagogue Church of all Nations, while at the same time cleaning the toilets

0:23:16.560,0:23:23.340
of the church every day for 3 years.

0:23:45.160,0:23:54.860
One may ask the question; "why did prophet T.B. Joshua keep such a detailed record, right from the beginning,

0:23:54.860,0:23:56.960
of the life he lived?".

0:23:57.000,0:24:04.900
He is a man of vision, and his vision was inspired by the Holy Spirit.

0:24:04.900,0:24:10.660
It has God behind it for its accomplishment.

0:24:45.720,0:24:51.540
Every day for 3 years prophet T.B. Joshua also cleaned the sewers

0:24:51.540,0:24:56.240
of the Synagogue Church of all Nations by hand.

0:25:10.400,0:25:15.260
Life is in stages.

0:25:15.260,0:25:30.420
This record shows that there are different stages I went through in life.

0:25:30.420,0:25:37.120
Each stage served a purpose.

0:25:37.200,0:25:44.640
What are you going through as a Christian?

0:25:44.640,0:25:48.040
Tell you neighbor; "Are you a Christian?".

0:25:48.040,0:25:55.940
Whatever you are going through serves a purpose.

0:25:55.940,0:26:07.600
It may be to stop you a while in order to preserve you.

0:26:07.600,0:26:19.640
It may be to stop you a while in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.

0:26:19.640,0:26:31.460
Tell you neighbor; "Whatever you are going through, as a Christian served a purpose".

0:26:31.460,0:26:35.820
Just a little while longer I wanna pray

0:26:35.820,0:26:37.700
Can’t get You off my mind

0:26:37.700,0:26:42.260
So I came to say thank You Lord

0:26:42.260,0:26:48.060
Just for loving me

0:26:48.060,0:26:52.320
Many times I do forget

0:26:52.320,0:26:55.180
Every need that You have met

0:26:55.180,0:26:59.300
O thank You Lord

0:26:59.300,0:27:03.840
I know You're showing me

0:27:03.840,0:27:08.240
You are there when I am down and out

0:27:08.240,0:27:11.240
You’re holding me

0:27:11.240,0:27:16.020
Your love is so amazing

0:27:16.020,0:27:21.080
O it changed me

0:27:21.080,0:27:24.240
Here I am with all I have

0:27:24.240,0:27:28.220
I raise my hands to worship You

0:27:28.220,0:27:33.320
I wanna say thank You

0:27:33.320,0:27:35.880
O thank You

0:27:35.880,0:27:38.900
For everything

0:27:38.900,0:27:41.040
For who You are

0:27:41.040,0:27:43.340
You covered me

0:27:43.340,0:27:45.100
You touched my heart

0:27:45.100,0:27:50.060
I wanna say thank You

0:27:50.060,0:27:53.020
O thank You

0:27:53.020,0:27:57.880
Here I am with all I have

0:27:57.880,0:28:01.340
I raise my hands to worship You

0:28:01.340,0:28:06.800
I wanna say thank You

0:28:06.800,0:28:09.740
O thank You

0:28:09.760,0:28:13.120
For everything

0:28:13.120,0:28:15.100
For who You are

0:28:15.100,0:28:16.980
You covered me

0:28:16.980,0:28:18.820
You touched my heart

0:28:18.820,0:28:22.820
I wanna say thank You

0:28:22.820,0:28:29.580
O thank You

0:28:29.700,0:28:33.740
Just a little while longer I wanna pray

0:28:33.740,0:28:35.800
Can’t get You off my mind

0:28:35.800,0:28:38.800
So I came to say thank You Lord

0:28:38.800,0:28:44.980
Just for loving me

0:28:44.980,0:28:50.640
Many times I do forget

0:28:50.640,0:28:53.540
Every need that You have met

0:28:53.540,0:28:56.320
O thank You Lord

0:28:56.320,0:29:02.720
I know You are showing me

0:29:02.720,0:29:06.740
You are there when I am down and out

0:29:06.740,0:29:09.320
You’re holding me

0:29:09.320,0:29:15.340
Your love is so amazing

0:29:15.340,0:29:18.140
O it changed me

0:29:18.140,0:29:22.280
Here I am with all I have

0:29:22.280,0:29:26.320
I raise my hands to worship You

0:29:26.320,0:29:30.940
I wanna say thank You

0:29:30.940,0:29:34.540
O thank You

0:29:34.540,0:29:36.860
For everything

0:29:36.860,0:29:39.300
For who You are

0:29:39.300,0:29:41.200
You covered me

0:29:41.200,0:29:42.940
You touched my heart

0:29:42.940,0:29:47.580
I wanna say thank You

0:29:47.580,0:29:55.760
O thank You

0:29:55.760,0:29:58.640
Hallelujah. You may be seated.

0:30:01.600,0:30:09.660
Whatever situation you are going through, serves a purpose.

0:30:09.660,0:30:19.380
It may be to stop you a while in order to reform you.

0:30:19.380,0:30:24.600
It may be to strengthen your desire.

0:30:24.600,0:30:28.780
Remember the man at the pool of Bethesda.

0:30:28.780,0:30:34.020
It may be to keep you for a new level in life.

0:30:34.040,0:30:41.680
We have seen people who had spent many years in the prison, later reaching the throne.

0:30:41.680,0:30:55.480
I don’t mind waiting

0:30:55.480,0:30:59.720
On You Lord

0:30:59.720,0:31:13.780
I don’t mind waiting

0:31:13.780,0:31:15.780
On You Lord

0:31:15.880,0:31:31.620
I don’t mind waiting

0:31:31.620,0:31:36.040
On You Lord

0:31:36.040,0:31:49.440
I don’t mind waiting

0:31:49.440,0:31:53.080
On You Lord

0:31:53.080,0:31:55.860
Thank you. You may be seated.

0:31:55.960,0:32:06.280
In the college of God, however brilliant you may be,

0:32:06.280,0:32:15.920
you will not be given double promotion. You will take every course.

0:32:15.920,0:32:23.780
In the University of God, however brilliant you may be,

0:32:23.780,0:32:31.760
you will not be given double promotion. You will take every course

0:32:31.760,0:32:36.740
because each course serves a purpose.

0:32:42.200,0:32:47.400
Imagine the rumors and gossip that spread as a result of this incident.

0:32:47.460,0:32:51.660
A prophet detained in a cell for taking drugs and harboring weapons.

0:32:51.660,0:32:57.100
However his enemies soon notice, that not even a detention in a cell and false accusations

0:32:57.100,0:32:59.480
would shake his faith in God.

0:32:59.480,0:33:05.740
To the wise this was a foolish thing, but God used it to reveal his purpose in the life of T.B. Joshua,

0:33:05.740,0:33:10.700
giving him the necessary experience and maturity to handle the greater responsibilities

0:33:10.700,0:33:13.340
God was preparing for him.

0:33:13.340,0:33:24.460
Like Joseph in the Bible; he has learnt what it is to be loved, hated, rejected, and slaved.

0:33:24.600,0:33:33.320
Accused and falsely convicted he bore everything that happened to him calmly.

0:33:33.400,0:33:37.320
This is the letter from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency confirming the innocence

0:33:37.320,0:33:38.800
of T.B. Joshua,

0:33:38.880,0:33:46.180
and clearing him from the charge of drug dealing, for which he was detained in a cell for 13 days.

0:33:46.200,0:33:51.620
Remember, our enemy may rob us of our liberty and confine us in a prison cell,

0:33:51.640,0:33:57.500
but they cannot shut us out of the throne of mercy and communion with God.

0:33:57.500,0:34:03.740
Falsely accused of drug dealing by the (NDLEA) National Drug Law Enforcement Agency,

0:34:03.740,0:34:09.800
T.B. Joshua was arrested and held in cell for 13 days.

0:34:09.800,0:34:15.080
This is the first appearance of T.B. Joshua, having just been released from the cell.

0:34:15.080,0:34:19.760
He addressed the congregation thanking them for their faithfulness and love,

0:34:19.760,0:34:26.780
for standing by him in the hard times, referring to their unequal effort towards his absence.

0:34:26.820,0:34:34.360
You can see the man of God T.B. Joshua looking lean, having spent 13 days in a cell.

0:34:39.620,0:34:52.920
I am using this opportunity to thank you all for your unequal efforts towards my absence.

0:34:52.920,0:34:55.060
I am here to thank you all.

0:34:55.060,0:35:00.420
God Almighty will continue to be with you.

0:35:00.600,0:35:12.760
If you stay to yourself, “Why me of all this trouble, persecution, tribulation and all sorts'of things,"

0:35:12.860,0:35:22.480
I want you to now think back and ask, “Why me of all these spiritual blessing in my life?”

0:35:22.480,0:35:27.340
When you count the blessing of God in your life, doubt will fly away.

0:35:27.420,0:35:36.100
Even if you are suffering and you lack of this and that, remember the blessing of God

0:35:36.100,0:35:40.100
like food, shelter and many others you are enjoying today.

0:35:40.100,0:35:45.320
Having searched and found nothing against him, T.B. Joshua was released from the cell,

0:35:45.380,0:35:50.200
and the following Sunday appeared in the church service to thank the members and appreciate their love

0:35:50.200,0:35:53.000
and support during his absence.

0:35:53.000,0:35:58.600
Rather than to complain and query; "why me of all this trouble and persecution?" T.B. Joshua encouraged

0:35:58.600,0:36:05.000
the congregation to remember the spiritual blessings many are denied of, such as food and shelter,

0:36:05.000,0:36:10.180
that they can hold the very Word of God in their hands, and read it,

0:36:10.180,0:36:14.360
that they have the knowledge of His saving grace.

0:36:14.360,0:36:23.420
The man of God encouraged them saying; "when you begin to count your blessings your doubts will fly away".

0:36:23.420,0:36:38.260
In the College of God, however brilliant you may be, you will not be given a double promotion.

0:36:38.260,0:36:43.400
You will take every course.

0:36:43.400,0:36:54.360
In the University of God, however brilliant you may be, you will not be given a double promotion.

0:36:54.360,0:36:59.300
You will take every course,

0:36:59.300,0:37:05.060
because each course serves a purpose.

0:37:05.060,0:37:16.580
Right from the beginning, I knew that I must taste poverty in order to manage blessing.

0:37:26.840,0:37:33.720
Hundreds of benches and fans were installed inside the new church for the thousands of members,

0:37:33.720,0:37:38.460
that came daily to attend the services.

0:37:38.460,0:37:45.780
Not only did the prophet T.B. Joshua ministered to the congregation, he also gladly and faithfully

0:37:45.840,0:37:49.780
cleaned the fans and benches daily.

0:37:49.800,0:37:53.060
There were hundreds of them.

0:37:53.060,0:37:56.440
He cleaned them all.

0:38:03.860,0:38:16.940
As Colossians 3:23-24 says; whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for man,

0:38:16.940,0:38:22.320
since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.

0:38:22.480,0:38:26.760
It is a Lord Christ you are serving.

0:38:38.480,0:38:44.020
He is seen here cleaning the floor of the entrance to the church.

0:38:54.980,0:39:05.140
As is his practice,  T.B Joshua regularly takes time out to share food with the children, and enjoy their presence.

0:39:59.700,0:40:05.860
Occasionally, T.B. Joshua can be found sitting among the children in their Sunday school class,

0:40:05.900,0:40:11.160
and visiting the babies in the nursing mothers section of the church.

0:40:11.160,0:40:19.180
He is an integral part of every department of the church.

0:40:31.600,0:40:39.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua is returning from the quiet moment of devotion in prayer at the prayer mountain,

0:40:39.500,0:40:45.120
to resume his activities at the church.

0:41:18.980,0:41:25.840
After conducting the Sunday service prophet T.B. Joshua would usually join the members in the canteen.

0:41:25.900,0:41:29.060
He serves water to the members.

0:41:30.960,0:41:38.000
This is one of services in the first building at the new site of the Synagogue Church of all Nations.

0:41:38.000,0:41:43.200
In fulfillment of the prophecy given by the man of God at the prayer mountain,

0:41:43.200,0:41:51.340
here you can see hundreds of people from around the world, who have come to listen to the Word of God,

0:41:51.440,0:41:56.780
that Jesus Christ has revealed to His servant - prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:42:02.140,0:42:15.700
Right from the beginning I knew I must taste tribulation in order to manage freedom.

0:42:20.580,0:42:29.300
Right from the beginning I knew I must taste condemnation in order to manage praises.

0:42:34.500,0:42:45.820
My objectives, right from the beginning, and my motives were determined at once.

0:42:45.820,0:42:58.160
I wanted what God wanted. I wanted if for the reason God wanted it.

0:42:58.160,0:43:09.440
Those principles anchored me through my teenage years.

0:43:09.440,0:43:15.340
They guided me.

0:43:15.340,0:43:26.100
They were the fountain stone of my life.

0:43:26.660,0:43:30.900
You raise me up

0:43:30.900,0:43:37.100
So I can stand on mountains

0:43:37.300,0:43:41.180
You raise me up

0:43:41.180,0:43:47.020
To walk on stormy seas

0:43:47.020,0:43:57.020
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders

0:43:57.020,0:44:00.960
You raise me up

0:44:00.960,0:44:04.580
To more than I can be

0:44:04.580,0:44:11.160
You raise me up

0:44:11.180,0:44:15.780
So I can stand on mountains

0:44:15.780,0:44:21.240
You raise me up

0:44:21.240,0:44:25.920
To walk on stormy seas

0:44:25.920,0:44:36.900
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders

0:44:36.900,0:44:40.900
You raise me up

0:44:40.900,0:44:44.600
To more than I can be

0:44:44.600,0:44:50.860
You raise me up

0:44:50.860,0:44:56.800
So I can stand on mountains

0:44:56.800,0:45:00.260
You raise me up

0:45:00.260,0:45:05.060
To walk on stormy seas

0:45:05.180,0:45:16.140
I am strong when I am on Your shoulders

0:45:16.320,0:45:19.460
You raise me up

0:45:19.460,0:45:23.320
To more than I can be

0:45:23.320,0:45:32.260
I don’t know why Jesus loved me

0:45:32.260,0:45:42.440
I don’t know why He cared

0:45:42.440,0:45:49.760
I don’t know why sacrificed His life

0:45:49.760,0:45:57.240
O but I’m glad so glad He did

0:45:57.240,0:45:59.940
You may be seated, thank you.

0:46:00.840,0:46:17.420
There were the fountain stone of my home, and the reason of our evangelists and pastors to be.

0:46:17.580,0:46:24.880
People of God, God has a time for everything.

0:46:24.880,0:46:35.580
A time to be born, a time to grow, a time to face persecution,

0:46:35.580,0:46:45.420
a time to overcome and a time to show the proceeds of victory.

0:46:51.040,0:46:56.480
Ask you neighbor: "what time are you in?".

0:46:56.480,0:46:59.140
Nothing happens by chance.

0:46:59.200,0:47:06.940
Unless you understand this, you will continue to murmur and despair

0:47:06.940,0:47:14.140
when what you want seems not to go the way you want it.

0:47:18.380,0:47:33.100
In the college of God, however brilliant you may be, you will not be given a double promotion.

0:47:33.100,0:47:40.400
You will take every course.

0:47:40.400,0:47:51.480
In the University of God, however brilliant you may be, you will not be given a double promotion.

0:47:51.480,0:48:03.640
You will take every course, because each course serves a purpose.

0:48:03.720,0:48:11.080
People of God, God has a time for everything.

0:48:11.080,0:48:21.740
A time to be born, a time to grow, a time to face persecution,

0:48:21.740,0:48:31.320
a time to overcome and a time to show the proceeds of victory.

0:48:54.240,0:49:01.760
During the raining season, heavy rain storms continue to flood entire church premises.

0:49:01.860,0:49:08.000
This is prophet T.B. Joshua in the rain in a dark-colored jacket.

0:49:29.180,0:49:38.640
Prophet T.B. Joshua works alongside the members to rebuild a wall that had been destroyed by the storm.

0:50:19.700,0:50:25.660
One life for Jesus is all I have. On live for Him is so dear.

0:50:25.660,0:50:34.520
He’s my love, my joy, my strength, my all. Without Him, I will fall.

0:50:46.880,0:50:53.000
Everybody desires a breakthrough,

0:50:53.000,0:51:04.020
whereas God sometimes uses disappointment

0:51:04.020,0:51:07.740
to keep us for a new level.

0:51:07.740,0:51:12.760
Everybody desires a breakthrough,

0:51:12.760,0:51:23.300
whereas disappointment is sometimes used

0:51:23.300,0:51:27.060
to prepare us for the challenges ahead.

0:51:27.060,0:51:32.260
Everybody desires a breakthrough,

0:51:32.260,0:51:40.820
whereas disappointment is sometimes used

0:51:40.820,0:51:47.600
to reform us for a better position in God.

0:51:47.600,0:51:52.080
Everybody desires a breakthrough,

0:51:52.080,0:51:58.640
whereas disappointment is sometimes used

0:51:58.640,0:52:03.120
to strengthen our desire for God.

0:52:03.340,0:52:13.080
Ask your neighbor; "Who knows what could have happened if your prayer for a better condition

0:52:13.080,0:52:16.220
had been answered?".

0:52:18.440,0:52:26.040
God’s time is the best time

0:52:26.040,0:52:34.580
My time doesn’t matter

0:52:34.580,0:52:42.900
God’s time is the best time

0:52:42.900,0:52:51.080
My time doesn’t matter

0:52:51.080,0:52:57.500
Everything that has to do with God is fixed

0:52:57.500,0:53:02.780
There is a time to be born

0:53:02.780,0:53:08.520
And a time to die

0:53:08.520,0:53:16.700
God’s time is the best time

0:53:16.700,0:53:23.520
My time doesn’t matter

0:53:23.520,0:53:32.720
God’s time is the best time

0:53:32.720,0:53:39.940
My time doesn’t matter

0:53:39.940,0:53:47.060
Everything that has to do with God is fixed

0:53:47.060,0:53:52.300
There is a time to be born

0:53:52.300,0:53:56.160
And a time to die

0:53:56.160,0:54:00.280
I choose to wait

0:54:00.280,0:54:03.860
Lord for Your time

0:54:03.860,0:54:08.360
I choose to wait

0:54:08.360,0:54:12.160
Only for You

0:54:12.160,0:54:20.200
I choose to leave my past behind

0:54:20.200,0:54:24.660
I choose to wait

0:54:24.820,0:54:29.660
Only for You

0:54:29.660,0:54:37.160
God’s time is the best time

0:54:37.160,0:54:44.360
My time doesn’t matter

0:54:44.360,0:54:53.260
God’s time is the best time

0:54:53.260,0:55:00.220
My time doesn’t matter

0:55:00.220,0:55:08.400
Everything that has to do with God is fixed

0:55:08.400,0:55:12.140
There’s a time to be born

0:55:12.140,0:55:16.740
And a time to die

0:55:16.740,0:55:25.620
God’s time is the best time

0:55:25.620,0:55:33.620
My time doesn’t matter

0:55:33.620,0:55:41.480
God’s time is the best time

0:55:41.480,0:55:48.800
My time doesn’t matter

0:55:48.800,0:55:56.200
Everything that has to do with God is fixed

0:55:56.200,0:56:00.900
There’s a time to be born

0:56:00.900,0:56:04.840
And a time to die

0:56:04.840,0:56:09.040
I choose to wait

0:56:09.040,0:56:13.180
Lord for your time

0:56:13.180,0:56:17.360
I choose to wait

0:56:17.360,0:56:21.340
Only for You

0:56:21.340,0:56:29.780
I choose to leave my past behind

0:56:29.780,0:56:33.900
I choose to wait

0:56:33.900,0:56:38.160
Only for You

0:56:38.160,0:56:46.540
I'm forever grateful to You

0:56:46.540,0:56:55.980
I'm forever grateful for the Cross

0:56:55.980,0:57:06.080
I'm forever grateful Lord to You

0:57:06.080,0:57:20.200
That You came to seek and save the lost

0:57:20.360,0:57:24.060
Hallelujah. Thank you. You may be seated.

0:57:24.060,0:57:26.000
Hallelujah.

0:57:26.000,0:57:36.880
When you know the principle of life, you will always reflect on life itself

0:57:36.880,0:57:40.260
rather than the situation you are in.

0:57:40.260,0:57:48.760
The principle of life is that nothing happens by chance.

0:57:55.260,0:58:07.060
Are you without strength, without smoothness of tongue, fast legs?

0:58:07.060,0:58:16.280
There is hope. Jesus is the hope.

0:58:16.280,0:58:25.740
This record is not saying I have arrived.

0:58:25.740,0:58:30.180
Remember our message here. Better is not good enough.

0:58:30.320,0:58:34.440
[congregation] The best is yet to come. [congregation]

0:58:44.220,0:58:50.300
As a Christian, the situation you are in serves a purpose.

0:58:50.360,0:58:58.700
You need to know the purpose it has, so that you stop grumbling, you stop to murmur.

0:58:58.780,0:59:06.500
In the Biblical characters from Genesis to Revelation,

0:59:06.600,0:59:13.040
nothing happens for nothing and nothing comes by chance.

0:59:13.040,0:59:25.960
In the Biblical characters, you will see how much pain,

0:59:25.960,0:59:37.020
how much hardship, trouble, tribulation, persecution, hatred, setback,

0:59:37.020,0:59:47.100
sickness, disease, they endured to come to a new level in life.

0:59:47.100,1:00:04.940
I know the persecutions I went through were the Lord's doing to strengthen my desire,

1:00:04.980,1:00:07.900
to keep me for a new level in life.

1:00:07.900,1:00:22.720
I know the hatred, the isolation, name-calling, intimidation, are the Lord's doing to preserve me.

1:00:22.720,1:00:34.780
The Lord used it to bring my real value.

1:00:38.900,1:00:45.040
The Lord used persecution to bring my real value.

1:00:45.040,1:00:52.540
When you are your real value, you will see life the way God sees it.

1:00:52.540,1:00:56.060
You will begin to see yourself the way God sees you.

1:00:56.060,1:00:59.780
You will work with God's projects.

1:00:59.780,1:01:05.240
You will get God's opinion about yourself and about others, when you are your real value.

1:01:05.240,1:01:08.880
Let someone say; "real value".

1:01:08.880,1:01:16.160
That is - what you are, not in the eyes of people but of God.

1:01:20.660,1:01:26.900
When you are your real value, you live the live of contentment.

1:01:26.900,1:01:29.740
A life without complain.

1:01:34.760,1:01:42.340
In the Biblical characters from Genesis to Revelation

1:01:42.340,1:01:51.140
nothing happens for nothing and nothing comes by chance.

1:01:51.140,1:02:04.120
In the Biblical characters, you will see how much pain,

1:02:04.120,1:02:15.200
how much hardship, trouble, tribulation, persecution, hatred, setback,

1:02:15.200,1:02:25.080
sickness, disease, they endured to come to a new level in life.

1:02:33.820,1:02:37.340
Welcome to a Sunday service at the Synagogue Church of all Nations.

1:02:37.360,1:02:42.080
T.B. Joshua is busy delivering an anointed message to the congregation.

1:02:43.880,1:02:45.260
What is that noise?

1:02:45.260,1:02:47.000
Where is the prophet going?

1:02:47.040,1:02:49.400
See the crowd rushing through the streets.

1:02:49.400,1:02:52.140
Where are they rushing to?

1:02:52.140,1:02:54.040
What we see is frightening.

1:02:54.060,1:02:59.360
Armed robbers are shooting on the streets outside the church.

1:02:59.420,1:03:03.200
See the man of God walking with boldness and confidence.

1:03:03.200,1:03:05.780
He has moved straight to the robbers.

1:03:05.780,1:03:08.300
See the scattered people.

1:03:08.300,1:03:10.180
What happened?

1:03:10.260,1:03:17.660
Well, let's follow the prophet and the crowd back into the church.

1:03:17.660,1:03:22.160
The prophet is making his way to the altar.

1:03:22.160,1:03:24.180
What's in his hand?

1:03:24.180,1:03:25.620
It's the gun.

1:03:25.680,1:03:28.660
The prophet has collected the arm robbers' gun.

1:03:28.660,1:03:31.580
This can only be the work of God.

1:03:31.580,1:03:36.400
[song] I know in whom I believe

1:03:36.400,1:03:40.060
I know in whom I serve

1:03:40.060,1:03:43.820
No evil principalities can change my mind

1:03:43.820,1:03:46.600
I know in whom I believe [song]

1:03:46.600,1:03:57.760
As the Bible says; "If you are a man of faith, fear of arm robbers in nonsense, fear of guns is foolish".

1:03:59.360,1:04:08.480
The purpose of this record – first, to show my total dependence upon God.

1:04:08.480,1:04:15.260
One life for Jesus is all I have. One life for Him is so dear.

1:04:15.260,1:04:22.900
He's my love, my joy, my strength, my all. Without Him, I will fall.

1:04:31.780,1:04:43.520
And to tell the weak that there is hope.

1:04:43.520,1:04:48.600
Jesus is the hope.

1:04:48.600,1:05:00.340
Are you without strength, without smoothness of tongue, fast legs?

1:05:00.340,1:05:08.460
There is hope. Jesus is the hope.

1:05:08.460,1:05:17.920
This record is not saying I have arrived.

1:05:17.920,1:05:22.820
Remember our message here. Better is not good enough.

1:05:22.820,1:05:26.560
[congregation] The best is yet to come [congregation]

1:05:33.460,1:05:38.240
It's my way of showing my thanksgiving.

1:05:38.300,1:05:48.300
Tell your neighbor; "No matter how good you are, no matter how clever you are,

1:05:48.300,1:05:56.200
there is always another level to reach for".

1:06:05.740,1:06:15.940
Those who are rich, in every sense of the world,

1:06:15.940,1:06:26.500
understand that life is a learning experience.

1:06:26.500,1:06:34.160
Those who are rich, in every sense of the world,

1:06:34.160,1:06:44.520
understand that life is a learning experience.

1:06:44.520,1:06:54.100
When you constantly strive to improve, you build a character.

1:06:54.100,1:07:02.220
We Christians enjoy the opportunity to be a coach to others.

1:07:02.220,1:07:05.640
Open your lips.

1:07:05.640,1:07:14.540
Ask God to remove the hands of evil spirit from the affairs of your life,

1:07:14.540,1:07:22.900
so that you can see life the way He sees it.

1:07:34.760,1:07:37.740
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

1:07:37.740,1:07:39.700
Amen.

1:07:39.700,1:07:44.960
This is your hour, this is your day, this is your time.

1:07:44.960,1:07:46.540
Amen.

1:07:46.540,1:07:48.820
Open your lips.

1:07:48.880,1:07:58.740
Continue to ask God to remove evil hands from affairs of your life - prayer!

1:08:42.200,1:08:44.920
In Jesus' name we pray.

1:08:44.920,1:08:46.680
Amen.

1:08:46.680,1:08:53.480
Don’t let my situation escape the anointing of God - prayer.

1:09:54.840,1:09:59.340
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray!

1:09:59.340,1:10:03.980
Amen.

1:10:03.980,1:10:05.220
This is your day.

1:10:05.220,1:10:09.280
Amen.
