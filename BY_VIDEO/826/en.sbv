Children of God, Emmanuel! (God with us  -  Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.780,0:00:05.940
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:05.940,0:00:10.900
My name is Corporal Yerimah Peter Ojoh.

0:00:10.900,0:00:16.660
I am from Edo State by birth. I reside here in Lagos.

0:00:16.660,0:00:19.820
I serve as a soldier in the Nigerian army.

0:00:19.820,0:00:22.460
Praise God.

0:00:22.460,0:00:27.640
The testimony that I have to share with you this morning

0:00:27.640,0:00:31.180
is a testimony about a liver infection.

0:00:31.180,0:00:35.240
Many people believe that a liver infection has no cure.

0:00:35.240,0:00:37.440
But Jesus has the cure.

0:00:37.440,0:00:43.500
Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.

0:00:43.500,0:00:49.720
It all happened in 2012 when my wife gave birth.

0:00:49.720,0:00:58.180
I was away on a mission in Darfur when my wife gave birth to my first son.

0:00:58.180,0:01:04.880
After giving birth, from the second day, unusual things started happening in my life.

0:01:04.880,0:01:13.380
My body changed - I could not walk, breath and even see well.

0:01:13.380,0:01:15.700
These are the things that started happening in my life.

0:01:15.700,0:01:17.900
I couldn't share this with anybody.

0:01:17.900,0:01:20.960
I was just lying in the hostel.

0:01:20.960,0:01:26.580
I was encouraged to visit the hospital for a medical check-up.

0:01:26.580,0:01:33.400
I could not go by myself, the M.R.S. on the mission assisted me.

0:01:33.400,0:01:43.280
The doctors could not detect the cause and referred me to our Level 1 hospital in Nyala,

0:01:43.280,0:01:47.320
which is the transit camp for all military staff in Darfur.

0:01:47.320,0:01:57.140
They carried out some medical examinations and could not detect what it was and referred me again,

0:01:57.140,0:02:02.580
to Pakistan Military Hospital, which is at Level 3.

0:02:02.580,0:02:09.940
I couldn't walk so I was assisted to reach there.

0:02:09.940,0:02:15.540
It was there where they carried out some medical tests about my life.

0:02:15.540,0:02:21.360
What you are seeing here are not school certificates but certificates of life.

0:02:21.360,0:02:22.720
Praise the Lord.

0:02:22.720,0:02:25.140
Please, can you help me.

0:02:25.140,0:02:26.540
God bless you.

0:02:26.540,0:02:32.320
The first one on the board indicates all the blood functions,

0:02:32.320,0:02:35.040
and they discovered that there was no problem.

0:02:35.040,0:02:41.300
They conducted a test on the liver. I didn't know then that I had a liver problem.

0:02:41.300,0:02:44.740
They detected that I had a liver infection.

0:02:44.740,0:02:55.120
It had risen from a normal number up to 80. If it had went up from 80 to 90, that would have been fatal.

0:02:55.120,0:03:08.440
The doctor's report confirmed that I could not walk, had severe headaches, pains, dizziness and could not stand.

0:03:08.440,0:03:13.760
They had to refer me to a place where they could refer me back to my country.

0:03:13.760,0:03:16.860
I and another soldier had that problem.

0:03:16.860,0:03:23.320
We were told that by Monday, the two of us would be referred to Nigeria.

0:03:23.320,0:03:27.480
That there was no cure for this kind of sickness.

0:03:27.480,0:03:35.740
On Sunday, my colleague who is now retired -

0:03:35.740,0:03:40.400
I believe wherever he is now he is watching Emmanuel TV because he is an Emmanuel TV partner -

0:03:40.400,0:03:43.760
he said they should bring me to the screen

0:03:43.760,0:03:47.660
because he had a laptop in the hostel on which he was watching the LIVE service.

0:03:47.660,0:03:50.900
He said they should call me and assist me to be there

0:03:50.900,0:03:53.880
as the Man of God was about to pray for the whole nation.

0:03:53.880,0:03:59.040
He wanted me to join them and lay my hand on the screen as he knew that something would happen.

0:03:59.040,0:04:08.920
The Man of God began praying. He said, "Wherever you are now, touch the screen, distance is not a barrier.

0:04:08.920,0:04:14.660
Connect your faith with mine. Whatever problem you have, Jesus knows about it".

0:04:14.660,0:04:20.360
Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.

0:04:20.360,0:04:24.340
I touched the screen and he then mentioned my problem.

0:04:24.340,0:04:29.400
He said, "I speak to your liver, bones and kidneys.

0:04:29.400,0:04:33.120
Whatsoever pain you have, I command the pain out!"

0:04:33.120,0:04:40.960
I said "Amen". They assisted me to touch the screen, then after the prayer they assisted me back to my bed.

0:04:40.960,0:04:46.960
During the night, something happened.

0:04:46.960,0:04:52.620
I was sleeping. Then, I heard a voice, an echoing voice saying, "My son, stand up!"

0:04:52.620,0:04:59.240
I woke up from my body, part of me was still lying down. I rose up and looked at myself.

0:04:59.240,0:05:04.580
I said, "Ah, what kind of magic is this?" because I was still seeing part of myself lying down.

0:05:04.580,0:05:10.980
He said, "I created you without a problem. Those bodies you are seeing here..." -  I was seeing two bodies.

0:05:10.980,0:05:13.820
I was seeing myself lying down on one side and another replica of myself lying down next to that one.

0:05:13.820,0:05:20.100
He said, "One has sickness, and the other has no sickness. Which one do you belong to?"

0:05:20.100,0:05:24.760
I said, "You created me without a problem or sickness, that is where I belong".

0:05:24.760,0:05:28.960
He said, "Ok, lay here. There is no sickness there" and I Iay in the body with no sickness.

0:05:28.960,0:05:37.740
Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.

0:05:37.740,0:05:39.380
Amen.

0:05:39.380,0:05:42.060
I lay there and then woke up.

0:05:42.060,0:05:48.640
There was no pain in my body. I was very strong and agile.

0:05:48.640,0:05:51.520
I looked at all of this and started shouting in the hall.

0:05:51.520,0:05:54.940
All the soldiers came and asked what happened.

0:05:54.940,0:05:58.720
I said, "It's because of that prayer. God has done it!"

0:05:58.720,0:06:00.820
They were celebrating with me.

0:06:00.820,0:06:08.500
The soldier who was also being referred to Nigeria with me left alone.

0:06:08.500,0:06:12.320
That was in 2012, but you can see me here today.

0:06:12.320,0:06:19.260
I'm healthy. People do ask if Emmanuel TV testimonies are magic

0:06:19.260,0:06:21.260
or if Prophet T.B. Joshua truly is a man of God.

0:06:21.260,0:06:27.420
I am here today to let the world know, that "Yes. Indeed, he is a man of God".

0:06:27.420,0:06:35.700
Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.

0:06:35.700,0:06:37.360
Amen.

0:06:37.360,0:06:41.860
He had never known me before. He had never seen me before.

0:06:41.860,0:06:46.280
If somebody needs proof, see that my report is from Sudan.

0:06:46.280,0:06:51.460
This is a confirmation from the United Nations. It is not from Nigeria.

0:06:51.460,0:06:56.300
When I came back and shared what had happened with my wife,

0:06:56.300,0:06:59.940
she said that even if she had called to find out, I would have told her that there was no problem.

0:06:59.940,0:07:03.420
"Let us go and test because you're telling me it is a deadly disease."

0:07:03.420,0:07:05.400
I said, "It is a deadly disease. I wouldn't be here now".

0:07:05.400,0:07:09.480
She said, "Let us test". Then, I went to the medical hospital in Forty-four.

0:07:09.480,0:07:18.860
The tests were conducted and according to the report, instead of the level 80 where the devil wanted me to die,

0:07:18.860,0:07:26.300
Jesus has given me life and the new level is at 33. Amen.

0:07:26.300,0:07:34.880
The battallion I went with was number 33 and Jesus gave me the same healthy liver number of 33. Amen.

0:07:34.880,0:07:37.720
Which is a normal range?

0:07:37.720,0:07:42.400
That is the normal range. That is how it is supposed to be for a normal human being.

0:07:42.400,0:07:43.820
Amen.

0:07:43.820,0:07:48.700
The reason why I have not been able to come here all this while, to share this testimony,

0:07:48.700,0:07:54.500
is because there was a saying then, "Don't watch Emmanuel TV. Don't partner with them.

0:07:54.500,0:07:58.920
You're a pastor so don't mix with them".

0:07:58.920,0:08:06.200
After some time I started seeing senior pastors with Morning Stickers.

0:08:06.200,0:08:14.620
Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.

0:08:14.620,0:08:20.580
I started seeing them with Morning Stickers on their vehicles. Some even have Morning Water.

0:08:20.580,0:08:27.600
I thought to myself that I am not a senior pastor yet, I am just a baby.

0:08:27.600,0:08:33.020
Since I am a baby, let me share this testimony so that the world will know that

0:08:33.020,0:08:38.320
the disease that the devil says nobody can cure, God can cure it.

0:08:38.320,0:08:43.380
God can remove the old part and put in a new one. That was my case.

0:08:43.380,0:08:52.120
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:52.120,0:08:55.640
We give all the glory to God for this wonderful testimony.

0:08:55.640,0:08:59.240
Sir, you have said it all. In the light of what Jesus has done for you,

0:08:59.240,0:09:02.520
what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?

0:09:02.520,0:09:08.140
Emmanuel! My advice to the viewers all over world is:

0:09:08.140,0:09:15.380
Number one is for all the ministers.

0:09:15.380,0:09:20.900
Don't say anthing against yourselves; don't condemn yourselves.

0:09:20.900,0:09:28.600
This race is one that Jesus has called you to, you have to team up together to defeat satan.

0:09:28.600,0:09:33.240
He says something in John 15:15,

0:09:33.240,0:09:40.320
"Henceforth I call you not servants as a servant will not know what a master is doing.

0:09:40.320,0:09:44.000
I call you friends so that the things I do will be made known unto you".

0:09:44.000,0:09:49.620
So why can't we join hands together and support the Man of God and support each other

0:09:49.620,0:09:54.040
so that more miracles can happen every day.

0:09:54.040,0:10:01.540
Secondly, this is for my colleagues - wherever you are, even on the battle field, Jesus is there.

0:10:01.540,0:10:07.980
Always connect yourself with faith. Pray with the Man of God and you will receive your miracle.

0:10:07.980,0:10:14.820
Those on the sickbed, whether you are having the same problem that "that man" was having then

0:10:14.820,0:10:18.820
because he's no longer here now, a new person is here.

0:10:18.820,0:10:24.760
If you're having the same problem that "that man" was having then, connect your faith wherever you are

0:10:24.760,0:10:29.120
with the Man of God today because he will pray for you and you will receive your own miracle

0:10:29.120,0:10:31.680
and God will see you through, in Jesus' name.

0:10:31.680,0:10:38.760
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
