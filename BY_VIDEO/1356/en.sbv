0:00:00.020,0:00:02.300
There's a woman there.

0:00:02.300,0:00:07.360
I know, it will look embarrassing; this marriage is about to collapse.

0:00:07.360,0:00:13.080
The marriage is about to collapse because of an accusation. Come out.

0:00:13.080,0:00:17.540
Your husband is here. I think this is threatening your marriage.

0:00:17.540,0:00:21.380
In response the prophecy of a couple having a problem in their marriage,

0:00:21.380,0:00:24.220
these two come forward to meet the man of God.

0:00:24.220,0:00:27.880
I said, there is a conflict between husband and wife that is here.

0:00:27.880,0:00:30.680
Yes, it is us, sir. That is why we are here.

0:00:30.680,0:00:33.200
It is not the fault of your wife.

0:00:33.200,0:00:37.920
There is an evil spirit that is tormenting this woman.

0:00:37.920,0:00:39.340
This is your wife.

0:00:39.340,0:00:40.240
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:40.240,0:00:44.500
What I am about to say is nothing - I will not be able to say it here

0:00:44.500,0:00:47.040
because your wife embarrassed you.

0:00:47.040,0:00:49.180
Yes, Man of God. It is true, Man of God.

0:00:49.180,0:00:51.980
People you are giving money - they are embarrassing you.

0:00:51.980,0:00:53.000
It's true, Man of God.

0:00:53.000,0:00:54.120
Don't worry.

0:00:54.120,0:00:58.040
Help us, Man of God!

0:00:58.040,0:01:00.540
She came from London two days ago just because of this issue.

0:01:00.540,0:01:05.720
Look, if you believe you are a beautiful lady and you are selling your beauty,

0:01:05.720,0:01:07.620
you are deceiving yourself.

0:01:07.620,0:01:13.900
Listen, this is your husband. If you leave this man - oh my God, forget about your beauty.

0:01:13.900,0:01:17.460
I know you have a spirit that is tormenting you to do what you are doing.

0:01:17.460,0:01:20.940
You have wronged him.

0:01:20.940,0:01:22.980
I have wronged him.

0:01:22.980,0:01:28.480
Did you listen to that? She said, inside her, she knows she has wronged you and she is sorry.

0:01:28.480,0:01:30.960
She will be delivered. Ok?

0:01:30.960,0:01:33.620
I am happy that you said this.

0:01:33.620,0:01:36.760
Stand up!

0:01:36.760,0:01:40.920
Whatever threat - the threat to leave the marriage or whatever, put it behind you,

0:01:40.920,0:01:42.500
there is nothing like that.

0:01:42.500,0:01:45.220
That should be the reason why you should love her.

0:01:45.220,0:01:48.280
What happened to you should be the reason why you should love this man.

0:01:48.280,0:01:52.500
What happened to this lady should be the reason why you should love her the more.

0:01:52.500,0:01:57.280
And tell those people, "Now I'm loving my wife more than ever before."

0:01:57.280,0:01:59.860
Shame off you.

0:01:59.960,0:02:01.140
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:01.140,0:02:02.580
Thank you so much!

0:02:02.580,0:02:03.960
Thank you, Man of God!

0:02:03.960,0:02:10.120
The man of God met with the couple after the service to pray for their deliverance.

0:02:10.120,0:02:17.800
Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the couple, delivering them both in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:02:17.800,0:02:22.140
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:02:22.140,0:02:24.480
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:24.480,0:02:26.520
My name is Lucky Egharevba.

0:02:26.520,0:02:32.760
I am a Nigerian, residing in the UK, and the good lady standing beside me is my wife.

0:02:32.760,0:02:35.020
She is Clara Egharevba.

0:02:35.020,0:02:40.200
Sir, tell us the word of prophecy that you received with your wife last week.

0:02:40.200,0:02:43.440
Yes, I can confirm the prophecy to be true.

0:02:43.440,0:02:48.840
The man of God was spot on because that was the reason why we actually came for the deliverance.

0:02:48.840,0:02:54.360
It is true because some time ago, my wife actually confided in me

0:02:54.360,0:02:58.320
to let me know that she has been attacked with the spirit of lust.

0:02:58.320,0:03:05.980
By so doing, I felt a bit so disturbed, knowing the kind of level we were in, in the UK.

0:03:05.980,0:03:10.900
That's actually why we came here. It has not been so easy coming here.

0:03:10.900,0:03:16.140
It has been taking me about two years, praying, fasting to make sure she comes here

0:03:16.140,0:03:22.140
to get herself delivered from this spirit of lust that has actually destroyed our marriage.

0:03:22.140,0:03:25.960
Ok, sir. Can you explain how long you've known her, how long you been married

0:03:25.960,0:03:30.260
and how this spirit of lust in the life of your wife really affected the marriage

0:03:30.260,0:03:32.660
and how you found out about this.

0:03:32.660,0:03:35.380
The spirit of lust has affected our marriage.

0:03:35.380,0:03:39.420
We have been together for over 20 years because our first son is 19 years now.

0:03:39.420,0:03:45.640
And 10 years ago, we celebrated our marriage and it was like a carnival,

0:03:45.640,0:03:48.880
very big in Benin - we came to celebrate our marriage.

0:03:48.880,0:03:55.240
But after the marriage celebration, the business that we were doing very very well,

0:03:55.240,0:04:02.260
we began to notice some galloping in the business and we didn't really know what was happening.

0:04:02.260,0:04:08.880
Whilst this was going on, from nowhere, I just packed my load from London

0:04:08.880,0:04:12.840
and I came to Nigeria for no reason. I didn't even know.

0:04:12.840,0:04:18.600
And I left a multi million business back in England.

0:04:18.600,0:04:26.040
While I was in Nigeria, I now diverted into something I didn't even know anything about.

0:04:26.040,0:04:28.880
I believe that this spirit was also tormenting me too

0:04:28.880,0:04:35.120
because I was now doing a bar business, completely different from what I even know.

0:04:35.120,0:04:40.300
Whilst I was Nigeria, I began to hear some rumours about my wife.

0:04:40.300,0:04:45.780
But because I have never believed in third parties coming into our marriage,

0:04:45.780,0:04:47.700
I have always ignored it.

0:04:47.700,0:04:50.600
So this kept on going.

0:04:50.600,0:04:54.840
Then whilst I was in Nigeria, my wife would also often come to Nigeria.

0:04:54.840,0:04:58.840
Every year, sometimes twice a year.

0:04:58.840,0:05:01.760
So it kept on going like that.

0:05:01.760,0:05:07.060
There was a day when I was about to see her off to the airport,

0:05:07.060,0:05:11.520
I noticed she was too glued to her mobile phone.

0:05:11.520,0:05:15.980
Then something just told me, "Can I have the mobile phone?"

0:05:15.980,0:05:21.180
When I got hold of the mobile phone, I discovered a whole lot of text messages

0:05:21.180,0:05:23.640
that were not really godly and friendly.

0:05:23.640,0:05:30.340
That was how I got to know that, "Oh, this rumour that I was hearing about, it's all true".

0:05:30.340,0:05:36.280
So I now said to her, "Let's see if we can make things work out".

0:05:36.280,0:05:39.200
I now invited her; she travelled back out that very day.

0:05:39.200,0:05:46.900
I now invited her to come back to Nigeria almost immediately so we could talk about it.

0:05:46.900,0:05:52.520
Then we did talk about it and I said, "Ok, try as much as you can".

0:05:52.520,0:05:55.100
But she also made me to understand that it was not her.

0:05:55.100,0:05:58.100
When the spirit came upon her, she could not handle it.

0:05:58.100,0:05:59.360
I understood it.

0:05:59.360,0:06:03.180
But because of also the preaching of the man of God who always says,

0:06:03.180,0:06:08.020
"Don't reject people because of their weakness" - I held on to that.

0:06:08.020,0:06:14.200
I kept on supporting her, praying and fasting to make sure a day like this actually comes to pass

0:06:14.200,0:06:18.640
where we can be standing and testifying for the glory of God and shame unto the devil.

0:06:18.640,0:06:20.040
That is actually why we are here.

0:06:20.040,0:06:26.020
Ok, sir. So you heard these rumours whilst you were in Nigeria and she was in the UK

0:06:26.020,0:06:30.460
and later when you discovered the various text messages on her phone, you confronted her.

0:06:30.460,0:06:35.120
Did she actually open up and admit that this was what was happening and

0:06:35.120,0:06:38.720
who were the caliber of people that she found herself meeting?

0:06:38.720,0:06:42.340
Yes. Going back to the prophecy of the man of God - that is where that one comes in.

0:06:42.340,0:06:47.700
Yes, when that happened, she admitted and confessed to me,

0:06:47.700,0:06:50.760
"Oh, this is exactly what the issue is".

0:06:50.760,0:06:54.960
The embarrassment that the man of God said, that was during the confession

0:06:54.960,0:07:00.160
when she was now telling me, mentioning names, I just discovered they were all the people,

0:07:00.160,0:07:05.760
even sometimes people that were even working under me which was really not too good at all.

0:07:05.760,0:07:10.140
That was actually where the embarrassment the man of God talked about comes in

0:07:10.140,0:07:11.640
and I confirm that to be true.

0:07:11.640,0:07:16.140
This is in confirmation of the prophecy that your wife's behaviour in the UK

0:07:16.140,0:07:19.640
really caused embarrassment to you because the people she was involved with

0:07:19.640,0:07:24.320
were people that were working for you or people that saw you as father figures, elderly people.

0:07:24.320,0:07:28.340
These were actually the people that she had an encounter with because of that spirit of lust.

0:07:28.340,0:07:30.740
Yes, that's correct.

0:07:30.740,0:07:35.400
Ok, and the man of God said that the marriage was literally on the point of collapsing

0:07:35.400,0:07:37.780
if not that the prophecy came forth.

0:07:37.780,0:07:39.140
What can you say about that, sir?

0:07:39.140,0:07:42.740
I can confirm that to be true because some time last year,

0:07:42.740,0:07:49.080
there is this my little cousin's daughter that my wife went to the house and

0:07:49.080,0:07:53.440
she gave the little girl her phone to help her to type a message.

0:07:53.440,0:07:58.660
That my cousin always tells her daughter that auntie is our brother's wife.

0:07:58.660,0:08:04.080
So after the little girl typed the message, she went back to her mother,

0:08:04.080,0:08:10.720
"Mummy, isn't it you said auntie is your brother's wife?" Her mummy said, "Yes".

0:08:10.720,0:08:13.560
Then the mummy said, "Why did you ask?"

0:08:13.560,0:08:19.580
She now said that the message she typed that auntie said she should help her to type was to a man.

0:08:19.580,0:08:22.220
Then that cousin called me.

0:08:22.220,0:08:26.800
So I felt disturbed. I said, "Ah, not again. Not after what we have gone through".

0:08:26.800,0:08:34.200
Then I also invited her to come and after, there was a little bit of argument

0:08:34.200,0:08:37.760
but she also let me know, "Oh yes, something went wrong".

0:08:37.760,0:08:43.120
I then said, "This time, it's either you come to The SCOAN for your deliverance

0:08:43.120,0:08:48.020
or the marriage has to stop. I am not going further without deliverance".

0:08:48.020,0:08:50.580
That was exactly how we finally came here.

0:08:50.580,0:08:53.920
Ok, so this was a situation this couple was in.

0:08:53.920,0:08:56.720
They had come to a point where they were about to separate

0:08:56.720,0:09:00.680
unless there was an agreement to come to The SCOAN for deliverance.

0:09:00.680,0:09:05.260
To the glory of God, sir, last week the Prophet located your case in a prophecy,

0:09:05.260,0:09:07.820
counselled you and then prayed for you and your wife.

0:09:07.820,0:09:11.820
Can you just tell us - since the deliverance that you and your wife received last week,

0:09:11.820,0:09:14.660
what are the changes you have witnessed to the glory of God?

0:09:14.660,0:09:20.020
Oh, I can confirm it's been so beautiful since the prayer from the man of God.

0:09:20.020,0:09:24.600
My wife is totally a new person. She is so different.

0:09:24.600,0:09:28.520
She is always saying, "I'm so light". It's like something left her.

0:09:28.520,0:09:30.660
She is actually a different person.

0:09:30.660,0:09:35.040
And I must say to you, I love her even more than I have always loved her.

0:09:35.040,0:09:37.740
I give all the glory to God. I say, "Thank You, Jesus, for this deliverance".

0:09:37.740,0:09:40.720
Amen let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:09:40.720,0:09:43.880
That is the power of deliverance in that word of prophecy.

0:09:43.880,0:09:48.260
So you mean to say now, sir, that there's no more thought in your heart of leaving your wife;

0:09:48.260,0:09:53.240
you're now with her and you know that that spirit of lust has left her completely.

0:09:53.240,0:09:55.140
Not at all. I have no thought of leaving her.

0:09:55.140,0:09:57.920
If it's possible, I want to marry her again and again and again.

0:09:57.920,0:09:59.760
I just love her.

0:09:59.760,0:10:03.380
Glory be to God Almighty. We thank Jesus Christ for what He has done in this marriage.

0:10:03.380,0:10:08.660
We just want to hear a quick word from your wife as well before listening to your advice, sir.

0:10:08.660,0:10:11.720
Madam, you are welcome, in Jesus' name. Just introduce yourself to us

0:10:11.720,0:10:17.060
and tell us how you can confirm the prophecy of the man of God to be true.

0:10:17.060,0:10:18.820
Good Morning, everybody.

0:10:18.820,0:10:22.480
My name is Clara Egharevba.

0:10:22.480,0:10:25.860
Everything my husband said about me is true

0:10:25.860,0:10:33.360
and the word of prophecy of the man of God is true.

0:10:33.360,0:10:36.120
So, how can you confirm that prophecy to be true?

0:10:36.120,0:10:39.040
Just explain how this prophecy is true for your life.

0:10:39.040,0:10:43.480
It started when I was a little girl.

0:10:43.480,0:10:52.080
I remember my mother always told me that when I was sleeping and dreaming, I would say a lot of words

0:10:52.080,0:10:54.800
and sometimes, they would get a paper and write it down.

0:10:54.800,0:10:59.660
My late father always said, "Oh, my prophetess starts talking".

0:10:59.660,0:11:04.820
Even sometimes, they told me that when I was sleeping, I would talk.

0:11:04.820,0:11:10.420
I noticed that if I wanted something now, and I said I wanted something, I would get it.

0:11:10.420,0:11:13.660
So the thing was always pushing me.

0:11:13.660,0:11:18.300
When he left London, I was mixing with bad friends.

0:11:18.300,0:11:22.460
When we were together, I didn't even know - I have lived in London for 30 years -

0:11:22.460,0:11:26.460
I didn't even know anywhere in London - just me and him like that.

0:11:26.460,0:11:34.780
But the influence of my friends added to my spiritual husband that was tormenting me.

0:11:34.780,0:11:38.200
But now, I'm so happy that I am delivered from it.

0:11:38.200,0:11:41.780
Thank You, Jesus. Thank you, Man of God, for saving me.

0:11:41.780,0:11:45.100
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ

0:11:45.100,0:11:48.260
We have heard it from our sister. She said that when her husband left -

0:11:48.260,0:11:53.480
strangely, he just suddenly left the UK to come to Nigeria despite his businesses there -

0:11:53.480,0:11:56.740
at that moment she was having the influence of bad friends.

0:11:56.740,0:12:01.420
Tell us, sister, what did that influence lead you to do -

0:12:01.420,0:12:04.680
the influence of these bad friends you were moving with?

0:12:04.680,0:12:13.020
A lot of things - going out, thinking out of wedlock, not concentrating on my husband.

0:12:13.020,0:12:16.660
Even sometimes when my husband called me, I wouldn't concentrate on him.

0:12:16.660,0:12:23.300
It made me to hate him; to feel that, "Oh, I have lived in the darkness, this man is not for me".

0:12:23.300,0:12:25.500
A lot of things.

0:12:25.500,0:12:30.040
And when that spirit of lust came upon you, you would not be able to control yourself at that point.

0:12:30.040,0:12:33.640
Yes, I wouldn't know. It was like when somebody gets drunk. You don't know what you are doing.

0:12:33.640,0:12:37.460
You think you're doing the right thing at that time.

0:12:37.460,0:12:41.100
We thank God that last week, you came to The SCOAN,

0:12:41.100,0:12:43.380
received that prophecy and the man of God prayed for you.

0:12:43.380,0:12:47.100
Just tell us what happened to you when the man of God prayed for you.

0:12:47.100,0:12:49.980
When I saw him, I was scared.

0:12:49.980,0:12:56.440
Then when he prayed for me, I felt something strange leaving my body immediately.

0:12:56.440,0:12:59.260
So when you people took me back, I said, "Oh God".

0:12:59.260,0:13:04.140
And on top of that, as far as I'm in this building, I know I have already been delivered.

0:13:04.140,0:13:07.580
You mean to say that since that prayer, you felt something leave you

0:13:07.580,0:13:11.760
and ever since then, what are the changes in your life and your marriage?

0:13:11.760,0:13:13.280
I'll be thinking differently.

0:13:13.280,0:13:17.780
It's like I just married my husband newly; the first love I have for him.

0:13:17.780,0:13:19.700
It's like I have just renewed it again.

0:13:19.700,0:13:23.560
Thank you, Man of God, for delivering from the spirit of lust.

0:13:23.560,0:13:25.200
Thank you so much. God bless you.

0:13:25.200,0:13:28.800
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:13:28.800,0:13:32.500
We give all the glory to God for what He has done in the life of this couple.

0:13:32.500,0:13:35.680
Madam, what is your word of advice to our viewers around the world,

0:13:35.680,0:13:38.180
with what Jesus has done for you?

0:13:38.180,0:13:44.100
It's just to believe in God and if you have any problem, don't hide it from God.

0:13:44.100,0:13:50.820
Don't listen to people; just come straight to a living church and be delivered and have trust.

0:13:50.820,0:13:54.880
Thank You, Jesus Christ. Finally let's just hear a word of advice from our brother as well

0:13:54.880,0:13:56.360
to cap off this wonderful testimony.

0:13:56.360,0:13:59.180
Sir, what is your word of advice especially to married couples

0:13:59.180,0:14:04.400
that may be facing a challenge that you and your wife once faced before you came here?

0:14:04.400,0:14:11.340
My advice to couples who are also in the state we were in the past:

0:14:11.340,0:14:15.580
Stand by your loved one because this spirit that is tormenting,

0:14:15.580,0:14:18.020
making someone to do what they're not supposed to do,

0:14:18.020,0:14:21.040
it's not really the person; it is the spirit behind it.

0:14:21.040,0:14:24.020
So I would advise couples to key into that word:

0:14:24.020,0:14:31.160
Don't reject someone because of their weakness, rather see how you can assist them, out of faith.

0:14:31.160,0:14:36.280
When you have any problem, don't run from God, run to God

0:14:36.280,0:14:39.980
and come and get your deliverance; look for any living church and get delivered.

0:14:39.980,0:14:44.020
And the same God that located us will also locate you for the glory of God, in Jesus' name.

0:14:44.020,0:14:47.600
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:14:47.600,0:14:48.960
We thank God for this marriage.

0:14:48.960,0:14:53.040
We pray that God will give you both the grace to make the Word of God the standard for your home

0:14:53.040,0:14:54.960
and we believe that as you do so, you are going to come back

0:14:54.960,0:14:57.340
with more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.
