There is another.  You have an indian hemp in your pocket.

0:00:05.780,0:00:09.740
Come out for deliverance.  Jesus Christ will set you free.

0:00:09.740,0:00:15.480
After Prophet T.B Joshua had given this prophetic message, this man came out from the crowd and

0:00:15.480,0:00:18.960
moved toward the alter in response to the prophesy.

0:00:18.960,0:00:22.840
that "there is a man here with indian                                  hemp in his pocket."

0:00:23.560,0:00:28.760
As he steps forward to confirm the prophesy, his deliverance is only a moment away

0:00:29.260,0:00:30.260
Come here!

0:00:33.380,0:00:40.740
Instructing the man to come on the altar, Prophet T.B Joshua reaches into his pocket and  pulls out an item.

0:00:43.160,0:00:45.160
What is this?

0:00:45.160,0:00:45.880

I am from Abia State, Nigeria.

0:01:15.500,0:01:19.500
We saw that the man of God was calling out words of prophesy during the first service.

0:01:19.900,0:01:24.500
You came out in response to one of them. Can you tell us the word of prophesy he spoke to you?

0:01:24.940,0:01:29.980
The man of God prophesied that there is a man here with indian hemp.

0:01:30.000,0:01:30.900
"Please you should come out!"

0:01:30.900,0:01:37.240
There is a brother, you have Indian hemp in your pocket.

0:01:45.120,0:01:50.100
This man came from out of the crowd and moved toward the alter in response to the prophesy.

0:01:50.500,0:01:54.240
that "there is a man here with indian                                    hemp in his pocket."

0:01:54.900,0:01:59.740
As he steps forward to confirm the prophecy, his deliverance is only a moment away.

0:02:00.840,0:02:02.800
Come here!

0:02:04.140,0:02:06.480
Instructing the man to come unto the alter

0:02:06.620,0:02:09.600
Prophet T.B Joshua reaches into his pocket

0:02:10.380,0:02:11.520
and pulls out an item.

0:02:14.660,0:02:16.720

Watch your screen

0:02:21.780,0:02:27.040
Confirming the prophesy, this is the indian hemp that was inside the mans pocket

0:02:28.200,0:02:31.040
Immediately he mentioned the case, I became afraid

0:02:31.040,0:02:36.680
and something fell on me, so I had to come out...because I am the person.

0:02:36.680,0:02:42.340
Since I have been smoking this drug,I have been into a lot of evil...

0:02:42.340,0:02:43.340
even bad gangs

0:02:43.340,0:02:45.860
You mean that you are the one that the man of God prophesied

0:02:45.860,0:02:49.040
that "there is a brother here who has indian hemp in his pocket;

0:02:49.460,0:02:51.360
in the house of God, and that mans should come out!."

0:02:51.860,0:02:53.640
Yes!

0:02:53.640,0:02:55.960
Where is that indian hemp now?

0:03:01.100,0:03:03.100
This is the indian hemp.

0:03:03.880,0:03:07.300
Okay you mean that this in your hand this is the indian hemp that you brought to the church today

0:03:07.300,0:03:09.140
that the man of God prophesied about

0:03:09.660,0:03:11.940
Yes!

0:03:12.060,0:03:13.940
Have you told anyone that brought indian hemp?

0:03:13.960,0:03:16.940
How is it possible, that you think that the man of God could prophesy this?

0:03:17.460,0:03:19.960
I am surprised because this drug,                                                                I brought it yesterday, I wanted to

0:03:19.960,0:03:24.260
smoke it.  Later in the night, I fell asleep; so I did not remember.

0:03:24.260,0:03:26.860
This morning I said that after the service, I will go out and smoke it

0:03:26.860,0:03:31.040
but I was surprised when I came here, the man of God mentioned it.

0:03:31.040,0:03:34.320
I became afraid. I have been trying to stop it

0:03:34.320,0:03:35.180
but to no avail.

0:03:35.180,0:03:37.940
I thank God for being here. I know that since God has

0:03:37.940,0:03:40.380
used the man of God to prophesy
about it, I know that the yoke

0:03:40.380,0:03:42.320
has been broken in my life.

0:03:42.320,0:03:44.840
Amen, continue to yield to the Holy Spirit

0:03:44.900,0:03:48.000
and you will be Christ filled, as He continues to lead you

0:03:48.080,0:03:49.740
to the throne, thank you!

0:03:49.740,0:03:51.120
Amen!
