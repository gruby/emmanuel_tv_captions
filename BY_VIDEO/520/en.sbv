0:00:00.100,0:00:04.440
Praise the Lord!

0:00:04.440,0:00:11.160
Praise His holy name!

0:00:11.160,0:00:19.900
I am meeting pastors and leaders!

0:00:19.900,0:00:29.560
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:29.560,0:00:41.640
The message is not only for the pastors but also for the leaders.

0:00:41.640,0:00:47.400
And the anointing of God too!

0:00:47.400,0:00:51.520
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:51.520,0:00:53.520
Hallelujah!

0:00:53.520,0:00:58.680
The Book of Galatians 5:6.

0:00:58.680,0:01:01.420
Very very important.

0:01:01.420,0:01:08.460
Also 1 Corinthians 13:13.

0:01:08.460,0:01:19.100
I want to talk about this before we go into the issue why we are here today.

0:01:19.100,0:01:25.000
Which is the book of Ephesians 4.

0:01:25.000,0:01:33.040
It actually gives me sleepless nights when I see the level that Christianity is going

0:01:33.040,0:01:50.100
and we cannot differentiate the Christians from religious people.

0:01:50.100,0:02:03.500
It is difficult today to separate the Christians from religious people.

0:02:03.500,0:02:20.880
Because of our practices, we find it difficult to know who is religious and who is a Christian.

0:02:20.880,0:02:32.520
I will now take this little message 'Christianity is not a religion'.

0:02:32.520,0:02:36.660
It is not a religion.

0:02:36.660,0:02:44.600
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:02:44.600,0:03:10.980
For Christians, Jesus actually came from above to keep the relationship and fellowship between us and God.

0:03:10.980,0:03:17.700
We don't need to go there; He came.

0:03:17.700,0:03:31.700
Just because of the relationship between you and God and our fellowship.

0:03:31.700,0:03:44.840
Christianity is not a religion but a love relationship.

0:03:44.840,0:03:52.620
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:03:52.620,0:04:03.160
That is why many of us today, we miss it.

0:04:03.160,0:04:15.260
We practice some teachings religiously.

0:04:15.260,0:04:27.240
When I say, some teachings religiously - without a loving relationship.

0:04:27.240,0:04:35.360
It is not a loving relationship if I stand here and fail to preach love;

0:04:35.360,0:04:58.900
we would continue to cause disunity, hatred and conflict amongst the Body of Christ.

0:04:58.900,0:05:09.100
Imagine if I was here preaching hatred,

0:05:09.100,0:05:19.380
telling you that place is not good, that religion is not good. No, we are not to judge.

0:05:19.380,0:05:36.000
If we judge now, who will judge us on the last day?

0:05:36.000,0:05:46.800
If I turn to be a judge, who will judge me on the last day?

0:05:46.800,0:05:47.920
Yes.

0:05:47.920,0:05:59.420
Christianity is not a religion but a loving relationship.

0:05:59.420,0:06:07.700
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:06:07.700,0:06:17.400
It is all about, "I love you and I love God"

0:06:17.400,0:06:22.100
I love God and I love you.

0:06:22.100,0:06:23.620
Hallelujah.

0:06:23.620,0:06:40.340
When you look at your life today, you will agree with me that your life is measured by your love for God.

0:06:40.340,0:06:54.760
Your life is measured by the love you have for God and for your fellow human beings.

0:06:54.760,0:07:02.540
Faith without love is faithless.

0:07:02.540,0:07:12.140
If you have faith without love, your faith cannot work.

0:07:12.140,0:07:25.680
That is why many of us today have a hard time using our faith.

0:07:25.680,0:07:43.180
In Galatians 5:6, Paul emphatically stated that faith works by love.

0:07:43.180,0:07:53.780
If faith works by love, it means one must possess these two.

0:07:53.780,0:08:15.860
The possession of both faith and love will motivate us to love God and our fellow human beings.

0:08:15.860,0:08:24.180
Without love, no matter how big your faith is,

0:08:24.180,0:08:38.200
you will only have passion for God, desire for God and an encounter with Him.

0:08:38.200,0:08:48.300
You cannot put love as passion or desire.

0:08:48.300,0:08:50.780
That is it.

0:08:50.780,0:08:58.140
Faith is faithless without love.

0:08:58.140,0:09:14.960
A person who does not love cannot be entrusted with the grace of God to heal, to deliver, to bless.

0:09:14.960,0:09:24.840
It is not possible for anyone without love to heal, in the name of Jesus.

0:09:24.840,0:09:37.260
It is not possible for anyone to deliver without love.

0:09:37.260,0:09:46.740
Because without love, it will become a personal gain.

0:09:46.740,0:09:55.900
When you don't love, you can collect money from anybody.

0:09:55.900,0:10:08.740
Even if a person is sick or dying, you would ask for money before praying for the person.

0:10:08.740,0:10:10.700
Without love.

0:10:10.700,0:10:15.620
Without love, money can come from anywhere.

0:10:15.620,0:10:23.800
Without love, you don't mind the source of money -

0:10:23.800,0:10:27.880
faith is faithless.

0:10:27.880,0:10:37.580
We ministers of God here today, I want to tell you, it is not possible.

0:10:37.580,0:10:51.240
Without the possession of both faith and love, you cannot go anywhere with God.

0:10:51.240,0:10:53.520
Take note of that.

0:10:53.520,0:11:03.720
You can see the hindrance you are having when using you faith.

0:11:03.720,0:11:05.720
Hallelujah.

0:11:05.720,0:11:12.520
I am taking you to the book of Ephesians for today's message.

0:11:12.520,0:11:18.120
The book of Ephesians 4.

0:11:18.120,0:11:23.060
Unity in the body.

0:11:23.060,0:11:31.920
Once again, it is all about love.

0:11:31.920,0:11:39.260
"Therefore, I, a prisoner for serving the Lord,

0:11:39.260,0:11:49.040
beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling,

0:11:49.040,0:11:58.960
a life worthy of your calling..."

0:11:58.960,0:12:05.780
Ask your neighbour, "What is your calling?"

0:12:05.780,0:12:07.440
Thank you.

0:12:07.440,0:12:14.900
If you are to live a life worthy of your calling,

0:12:14.900,0:12:20.680
if that calling is from God,

0:12:20.680,0:12:35.680
the most important aspect in your life to God is love.

0:12:35.680,0:12:43.800
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:12:43.800,0:12:52.080
If you are to live a life worthy of your calling,

0:12:52.080,0:12:57.440
and that calling is from God,

0:12:57.440,0:13:02.320
you are what you love

0:13:02.320,0:13:14.860
and your life is measured by your love to God and your fellow human beings.

0:13:14.860,0:13:23.840
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:13:23.840,0:13:41.000
Whatever your profession flows out of your relationship with Jesus.

0:13:41.000,0:13:55.620
Are you a pastor or whatever your calling flows out of your relationship with Jesus.

0:13:55.620,0:14:03.620
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:14:03.620,0:14:17.420
If you desire greater things, you need a greater relationship.

0:14:17.420,0:14:25.820
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:14:25.820,0:14:32.020
Verse 30.

0:14:32.020,0:14:38.740
"And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit..."

0:14:38.740,0:14:47.580
Our heart is the contact point for the Holy Spirit.

0:14:47.580,0:14:56.280
But the question is, "Is your heart free?"

0:14:56.280,0:15:04.100
As you are sitting, you need a free spirit.

0:15:04.100,0:15:06.920
Are you free?

0:15:06.920,0:15:11.600
Are you free from your past?

0:15:11.600,0:15:15.480
From where you are coming from?

0:15:15.480,0:15:22.820
Are you still in the present or in the past?

0:15:22.820,0:15:31.220
A free spirit is sensitive to God;

0:15:31.220,0:15:38.900
it can contact God, it can attract God.

0:15:38.900,0:15:45.160
We receive here free spirit.

0:15:45.160,0:15:50.140
Are you free?

0:15:50.140,0:15:55.080
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:15:55.080,0:16:02.260
"...Remember, He has identified you as His own,

0:16:02.260,0:16:12.600
guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.

0:16:12.600,0:16:18.280
Get rid of all bitterness..."

0:16:18.280,0:16:30.360
I have been to so many pastors and leaders' conferences

0:16:30.360,0:16:48.600
and I have seen the Spirit of Father descend but did not remain.

0:16:48.600,0:16:53.820
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:16:53.820,0:17:06.580
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:17:06.580,0:17:21.460
He does not remain when He is grieved.

0:17:21.460,0:17:26.700
That the Spirit of God will not descend here today - no!

0:17:26.700,0:17:44.500
It's hundred percent guaranteed but the question is, "Will that Spirit remain in you?"

0:17:44.500,0:17:52.500
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:17:52.500,0:18:11.380
Because of pride and arrogance - our past life. Many are still living in the past as we are talking now.

0:18:11.380,0:18:24.920
When the Spirit of Father comes, He wants to be Himself in us.

0:18:24.920,0:18:36.780
Did you know that? That is to be ungrieved.

0:18:36.780,0:18:41.840
To be ungrieved.

0:18:41.840,0:18:49.520
When He comes---
I am telling you because He is about to come now.

0:18:49.520,0:18:57.580
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:18:57.580,0:19:17.320
When He comes, He wants to be Himself in us.

0:19:17.320,0:19:28.320
That is, to be ungrieved.

0:19:28.320,0:19:45.640
Many of us are coming from falsehood, fear of failure, fear of false accusation,

0:19:45.640,0:19:54.220
longstanding grudges, unforgiving spirits.

0:19:54.220,0:20:00.280
There are so many people you cannot forgive.

0:20:00.280,0:20:05.280
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:20:05.280,0:20:12.080
When you look at the book of James 5:17,

0:20:12.080,0:20:29.100
Elijah became depressed because he was angry with God.

0:20:29.100,0:20:38.900
He was a man just like you.

0:20:38.900,0:21:06.320
Depression comes from longstanding grudges, spirit of pride, arrogance.

0:21:06.320,0:21:19.220
We pastors, you know there is no superstar in the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

0:21:19.220,0:21:33.020
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:21:33.020,0:21:47.680
The spirit of competition among churches - robbing Peter to pay Paul.

0:21:47.680,0:21:58.500
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:21:58.500,0:22:08.680
Competition; we are not running a race between churches.

0:22:08.680,0:22:23.020
When the Spirit of Father comes, He wants to be Himself in you.

0:22:23.020,0:22:32.560
Are you free?

0:22:32.560,0:22:36.480
Do you have a free spirit?

0:22:36.480,0:22:43.400
Nothing bothers you at all now as you are sitting down?

0:22:43.400,0:22:54.180
Those things that bother you put your spirit in bondage.

0:22:54.180,0:22:58.440
Will T.B. Joshua touch me?

0:22:58.440,0:23:01.920
Will this man pray for me?

0:23:01.920,0:23:05.320
Will I get healed?

0:23:05.320,0:23:09.300
Will I be anointed today?

0:23:09.300,0:23:15.140
How will I get free today?

0:23:15.140,0:23:26.960
Spirit of bitterness, envy and jealousy.

0:23:26.960,0:23:34.780
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:23:34.780,0:23:41.800
These are the things that grieve the Holy Spirit.

0:23:41.800,0:23:49.620
He wants to remain in you and you to remain in Him

0:23:49.620,0:23:56.580
but because of all these---

0:23:56.580,0:24:04.580
The greatest battle seems to be the senses.

0:24:04.580,0:24:12.280
What you see, you desire it.

0:24:12.280,0:24:21.180
What you smell, you want to taste it.

0:24:21.180,0:24:28.640
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:24:28.640,0:24:37.740
This is my fear now, you have to be free before I come into your midst.

0:24:37.740,0:24:43.420
You have to release yourself! Rise up and begin to release yourself!

0:24:43.420,0:24:50.600
Rise up and begin to release yourself from that spirit of bitterness, unforgiving spirit,

0:24:50.600,0:24:53.300
where you are coming from,

0:24:53.300,0:24:56.960
those things that are bothering you!

0:24:56.960,0:25:01.820
Stand up and begin to release yourself!

0:25:01.820,0:25:09.440
So that the Spirit of God can remain and you too can remain in Him.

0:25:09.440,0:25:13.880
Open your lips and begin to release yourself!

0:25:13.880,0:25:19.480
What are you worried about? 
What are you thinking about?

0:25:19.480,0:25:24.860
The Spirit of Father needs a free spirit.

0:25:24.860,0:25:29.980
Open your lips right now!

0:25:29.980,0:25:48.620
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:25:48.620,0:25:52.940
Release me Lord!

0:25:52.940,0:25:57.220
Make me Your vessel of honour.

0:25:57.220,0:26:08.740
Release me Lord from the spirit of fear!

0:26:08.740,0:26:12.420
Fear of failure.

0:26:12.420,0:26:16.660
Fear of false accusation.

0:26:16.660,0:26:22.880
Fear of sickness and disease.

0:26:22.880,0:26:26.660
Fear of setback.

0:26:26.660,0:26:32.220
Fear of limitation.

0:26:32.220,0:26:35.780
Fear of divorce.

0:26:35.780,0:26:46.440
Open your lips and begin to release yourself! There are many fears.

0:26:46.440,0:26:51.460
Release me Lord!

0:26:51.460,0:26:58.900
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:26:58.900,0:27:06.100
When you come Lord, I want You to be in me!

Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:27:18.160,0:27:34.260
Begin to dump all the bitterness, malice, evil speaking!

0:27:34.260,0:27:43.200
Dump them!

0:27:43.200,0:27:54.660
Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:27:54.660,0:28:00.700
Dump them - the spirit of anger, spirit of bitterness,

0:28:00.700,0:28:05.920
spirit of pride, arrogance,

0:28:05.920,0:28:11.280
malice, evil speaking!

Amen.
