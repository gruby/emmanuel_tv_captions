0:00:00.000,0:00:04.120
Let somebody say: "Thank you, Jesus!"

0:00:04.120,0:00:10.440
Indeed, a million thanks are not enough to express our gratitude to God

0:00:10.440,0:00:14.400
for what you have been seeing from the beginning of the service.

0:00:14.400,0:00:22.240
Let somebody say: "The Lord is here". Let somebody say: "The Healer is in our midst."

0:00:22.240,0:00:27.060
Let somebody say: "The living God is in our midst."

0:00:27.060,0:00:35.260
The Creator of Heaven and earth is in our midst through his Word and by his Spirit

0:00:35.260,0:00:40.740
Give thanks to Him.

0:00:40.740,0:00:52.080
Say: "Lord Jesus, I thank you for every moment of Your attention".

0:00:52.080,0:01:02.060
Say: "Lord, we don't know how to satisfy the needs of our lives

0:01:02.060,0:01:07.140
but Lord, You do -  that's why I'm here."

0:01:07.140,0:01:10.180
Say: "Lord, that's why I'm here."

0:01:10.180,0:01:16.160
Give thanks to God for His mercy and for His grace.

0:01:16.160,0:01:18.480
You maybe seated in His presence.

0:01:18.480,0:01:19.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:19.700,0:01:21.640
Hallelujah!

0:01:21.640,0:01:23.920
Am I talking to believers?

0:01:23.920,0:01:25.880
I hear only two.

0:01:25.880,0:01:30.300
Am I talking to believers in Christ?

0:01:30.300,0:01:36.160
If I am talking to a genuine believer, a smile should enlighten your face

0:01:36.160,0:01:40.900
because you know it has been done already.

0:01:40.900,0:01:45.000
Yes, brethren.

0:01:45.000,0:01:57.160
Christianity is not a religion but a living relationship with a living God.

0:01:57.160,0:02:07.400
Just because a person calls himself a Christian does not mean he is a believer.

0:02:07.400,0:02:18.800
A man of sense-knowledge belief may mentally assent and never have;

0:02:18.800,0:02:23.580
he may hope and never have.

0:02:23.580,0:02:31.880
He may be familiar with the original text of the of the Scriptures in Greek and Hebrew,

0:02:31.880,0:02:38.360
he may know the history of the Word and still never have.

0:02:38.360,0:02:39.320
Let someone say:

0:02:39.320,0:02:58.840
It is not our logic, our philosophy, our knowledge that brings about a new life in Christ Jesus.

0:02:58.840,0:03:03.660
Men may mentally assent and not have.

0:03:03.660,0:03:15.680
Men may do much by outward restraint but lack the character of God in their resolutions.

0:03:15.680,0:03:22.360
That's why the Bible says in the Book of Matthew 7:20

0:03:22.360,0:03:27.720
By their fruit you shall know them.

0:03:27.720,0:03:36.720
Jesus Christ never strived to look good; He was simply good.

0:03:36.720,0:03:46.260
Jesus Christ never strived to have a good reputation; He had character from above.

0:03:46.260,0:03:55.780
A man can be a Christian by profession, by confession and not such in heart.

0:03:55.780,0:04:02.880
Human knowledge, human understanding oftentimes makes a mistaken judgement

0:04:02.880,0:04:13.780
of character but the Lord only values the holy faith, love, peace -  the fruit of the spirit -

0:04:13.780,0:04:17.540
embedded in your heart, beyond human discernment

0:04:17.540,0:04:20.220
This leads us to the title of our message:

0:04:20.220,0:04:24.000
CHRISTIANITY IS ALL ABOUT HEART

0:04:24.000,0:04:29.480
Let's somebody say: "True Christianity is all about heart."

0:04:29.480,0:04:37.640
Let me take you to the book of Matthew 15:8

0:04:37.640,0:04:40.220
It says,

0:04:40.220,0:04:46.340
"These people draw near to Me with their mouth and honour me with their lips,

0:04:46.340,0:04:49.460
but their heart is far from me..."

0:04:49.460,0:04:51.240
Verse 9:

0:04:51.240,0:04:59.220
"And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."

0:04:59.220,0:05:03.320
Let somebody say: "It's all about heart."

0:05:03.320,0:05:09.280
The Book of Proverbs 27:19 says that

0:05:09.280,0:05:12.140
our life reflects what is in our hearts.

0:05:12.140,0:05:21.800
This means the heart refers to the man himself.

0:05:21.800,0:05:23.220
The Prophet T.B. Joshua says

0:05:23.220,0:05:31.480
it is the seat of desires, emotions, knowledge, conscience and moral character.

0:05:31.480,0:05:37.780
Let somebody say: "Living is all about heart."

0:05:37.780,0:05:39.560
2 Corinthians 5.

0:05:39.560,0:05:48.240
The mind of God says that if anyone is in Christ Jesus, he is a new creation.

0:05:48.240,0:05:54.380
The old man has ceased to be; the new man has taken place.

0:05:54.380,0:06:01.580
This means your past is over. Say: "My past is over."

0:06:01.580,0:06:07.520
When your past is over, it means you are born anew.

0:06:07.520,0:06:13.920
It means you are sanctified by the truth of Christ.

0:06:13.920,0:06:21.980
When you give the control of your life to Jesus, the Lord will give you a new heart,

0:06:21.980,0:06:26.100
He will give you a new nature and new desire to please Him.

0:06:26.100,0:06:28.220
Say: "Neighbour,

0:06:28.220,0:06:38.160
when you give the control of your life to God, He will give you a new heart,

0:06:38.160,0:06:43.360
a new desire to please Him."

0:06:43.360,0:06:52.480
Accepting Jesus Christ is to accept the nature of God.

0:06:52.480,0:07:00.140
How do we have the nature of God? It is God's Word that builds the nature of God into us.

0:07:00.140,0:07:02.060
In other words,

0:07:02.060,0:07:14.580
Christ is building Himself into us, as His Word rules, dominates and sanctifies our spirit nature.

0:07:14.580,0:07:15.320
Let somebody say:

0:07:15.320,0:07:20.640
"God's Word is spirit and life."

0:07:20.640,0:07:33.640
Whatever my heart engages on, influences my conduct and my character.

0:07:33.640,0:07:42.920
The Holy Spirit uses God's Word to act upon our soul to produce the virtues of Christ's character.

0:07:42.920,0:07:47.140
God's Word can only enlighten you and me, it can only quicken us

0:07:47.140,0:07:50.340
when it is illumined by the Spirit of God.

0:07:50.340,0:07:56.140
God's Word reflects His character.

0:07:56.140,0:08:04.220
When the Word of God dominates our mouth, it will dominate our heart.

0:08:04.220,0:08:12.380
When the Word of God dominates our heart, it will influence our behaviour, our character, our attitude.

0:08:12.380,0:08:12.900
Let someone say:

0:08:12.900,0:08:16.840
"The Word of God - the living Word -

0:08:16.840,0:08:23.520
the Word of God is the living presence of the divine power.

0:08:23.520,0:08:35.800
It is God's power working through His Word and by His Spirit that brings about a new life.

0:08:35.800,0:08:46.620
I am here for a change. My life will change. My attitude will change. My past is over.

0:08:46.620,0:08:52.760
The evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.

0:08:52.760,0:08:58.420
Today, if you believe, no matter your past,

0:08:58.420,0:09:03.540
Jesus has come to put an end to your past and give birth to your future.

0:09:03.540,0:09:10.500
The Gospel of God's grace challenges and changes everything.

0:09:10.500,0:09:15.920
We have seen a sinner's character being healed.

0:09:15.920,0:09:21.680
We have seen a liar becoming truthful.

0:09:21.680,0:09:26.140
We have seen a drunkard becoming sober.

0:09:26.140,0:09:31.160
To His power nothing is impossible.

0:09:31.160,0:09:38.300
Saul grew up under the feet of Gameliel. He knew all the rights of the law of Moses.

0:09:38.300,0:09:43.640
But the Bible says he was serving a God he did not know.

0:09:43.640,0:09:48.720
Because we can't God by outward things.

0:09:48.720,0:09:54.260
He was persecuting those who believed in Christ Jesus.

0:09:54.260,0:10:00.720
Because he was living outside the truth, where the true light comes from.

0:10:00.720,0:10:04.120
Saul simply needed to know God better.

0:10:04.120,0:10:06.120
Say: "Neighbour,

0:10:06.120,0:10:15.940
you need to know God better. No matter your problem, focus on God.

0:10:15.940,0:10:25.340
You need to know God better." Just an encounter with the Lord and your life will change today.

0:10:25.340,0:10:28.660
After his encounter with Jesus,

0:10:28.660,0:10:35.680
Saul's sense-knowledge belief gave way to a new kind of knowledge.

0:10:35.680,0:10:40.340
It is a spiritual knowledge, revelation knowledge.

0:10:40.340,0:10:41.520
The Bible says that

0:10:41.520,0:10:52.680
immediately Saul discovered the man God wanted him to be, the great Apostle Paul.

0:10:52.680,0:11:01.720
Jesus Christ never disconnects Himself from anyone who makes mistakes in their life.

0:11:01.720,0:11:08.480
No matter what brought you here today, no matter the mistakes you have committed -

0:11:08.480,0:11:10.700
there is hope for you.

0:11:10.700,0:11:13.180
I say, there is hope for you.

0:11:13.180,0:11:21.060
Jesus never rejected anyone who came to Him for healing, deliverance, salvation.

0:11:21.060,0:11:23.660
There was a woman of bad character.

0:11:23.660,0:11:27.500
The Bible says she was a sinful woman.

0:11:27.500,0:11:32.780
But she met Jesus in the house of Simon, the Pharisee.

0:11:32.780,0:11:41.700
Jesus met her in the condition where she was rejected because of the sinful life she was living.

0:11:41.700,0:11:51.540
But immediately she knew about Jesus, the Bible says, she became conscious of her sins

0:11:51.540,0:12:02.620
and she ran to Jesus ready to restore and make peace with her Creator, Jesus Christ the Lord.

0:12:02.620,0:12:13.960
She came to Jesus behind, crying and Jesus saw in her an attitude of remorse, humility,

0:12:13.960,0:12:18.340
self-denial and a desire to change.

0:12:18.340,0:12:24.780
And the Lord was moved to compassion, brushed aside her unworthy past

0:12:24.780,0:12:27.480
and her life of prostitution came to an end.

0:12:27.480,0:12:31.840
She became a woman of noble character.

0:12:31.840,0:12:34.940
I want you to talk to your neighbour, say: "Neighbour,

0:12:34.940,0:12:38.420
I don't know what you are going through,

0:12:38.420,0:12:41.580
I don't know where you are coming from,

0:12:41.580,0:12:44.040
I don't know what your challenge is

0:12:44.040,0:12:51.800
but all I know, we are are serving a God who never dodges crisis.

0:12:51.800,0:12:54.880
He sees them as a challenge.

0:12:54.880,0:13:02.220
If you put your problem into the hand of Jesus today, He will put his peace in your heart.

0:13:02.220,0:13:04.940
Say neighbour: "Are you such in heart?"

0:13:04.940,0:13:10.340
Ask your neighbour: "Are you such in heart?"

0:13:10.340,0:13:12.860
Man of God says:

0:13:12.860,0:13:23.160
"The principal source of finding ourselves spiritually, the principal source of knowing ourselves saved

0:13:23.160,0:13:29.820
is the Holy Bible; there is no substitute to it.

0:13:29.820,0:13:37.820
The Word of God is the seed of divine life that comes into our heart and causes faith to grow.

0:13:37.820,0:13:45.900
And faith purifies the heart and sanctifies it from all those lusts of the world.

0:13:45.900,0:13:47.900
Are you ready?

0:13:47.900,0:13:50.200
Say: "Neighbour, are you ready?

0:13:50.200,0:13:53.280
For the radical transformation

0:13:53.280,0:13:57.360
that only God can bring?

0:13:57.360,0:14:08.280
Today, many confess the name of Jesus Christ and deny Him in action.

0:14:08.280,0:14:14.520
Many confess the name of the Lord and deny Him by their attitude.

0:14:14.520,0:14:22.560
Their attitude does not reflect what they believe. What is the cause of this?

0:14:22.560,0:14:31.920
Only our character can testify to our confession of Jesus.

0:14:31.920,0:14:39.780
Jesus Christ has no place in the heart not dominated by His Word.

0:14:39.780,0:14:44.200
The word has priority over His name.

0:14:44.200,0:14:49.120
We must be grounded, rooted in the Word of God before we call that name,

0:14:49.120,0:14:55.100
before we bring Jesus on the scene.

0:14:55.100,0:15:04.580
Failure to give Jesus Christ His proper position in our hearts is actually responsible

0:15:04.580,0:15:08.080
for the crisis of our faith today.

0:15:08.080,0:15:08.740
Let someone say:

0:15:08.740,0:15:18.740
"Failure to give Jesus His proper position in our heart is actually responsible

0:15:18.740,0:15:22.300
for the crisis of our faith.

0:15:22.300,0:15:29.680
In other words, failure to allow the Word of God in the midst of our hearts

0:15:29.680,0:15:34.640
is actually responsible for the crisis of our faith.

0:15:34.640,0:15:39.520
Brethren, I put to you finally.

0:15:39.520,0:15:51.460
In Christ Jesus there is a general offer of life and salvation to all who believe.

0:15:51.460,0:15:55.920
When you accept Jesus Christ genuinely,

0:15:55.920,0:16:01.300
you have the very presence of God in your heart through the Holy Spirit.

0:16:01.300,0:16:02.420
And the man of God says

0:16:02.420,0:16:07.780
the Holy Spirit is God's imperative of life. He is a Giver  of all life.

0:16:07.780,0:16:12.900
He renews and changes our lives.

0:16:12.900,0:16:17.880
The basic work of the Spirit of God in our life in salvation is to impart a new life

0:16:17.880,0:16:20.300
into the heart of the believer.

0:16:20.300,0:16:26.300
Thus making me and you a child of God, a true believer in Christ.

0:16:26.300,0:16:32.280
I want you to stand up in His presence. Say:

0:16:32.280,0:16:38.700
"Lord Jesus, I am here for a change.

0:16:38.700,0:16:48.120
I am here, Lord, for the radical transformation of my life that only You can bring.

0:16:48.120,0:16:57.540
Lord, here I am. I believe; help me overcome my unbelief.

0:16:57.540,0:16:59.580
Here I am.

0:16:59.580,0:17:03.300
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ."

0:17:03.300,0:17:04.220
Brethren,

0:17:04.220,0:17:11.560
the moment you make Jesus the CEO, the Director of your life,

0:17:11.560,0:17:15.100
you will be wired to the creator in a unique way.

0:17:15.100,0:17:19.620
You will fear no more; you will worry no more.

0:17:19.620,0:17:24.940
I am reconciled; I am linked up with God.

0:17:24.940,0:17:26.880
Brethren,

0:17:26.880,0:17:31.660
to be born again is to have a new life.

0:17:31.660,0:17:36.220
Repentance is our only hope for God's mercy.

0:17:36.220,0:17:41.160
It is a commitment to a new way of life.

0:17:41.160,0:17:47.300
It is a commitment to a new way of righteousness of following God in Spirit and in truth.

0:17:47.300,0:17:53.260
When you follow Jesus today, your life will change, your attitude will change

0:17:53.260,0:17:56.880
and you will become saved and delivered in Jesus' name.

0:17:56.880,0:18:00.500
May the Word of God bless your heart in Jesus Christ's name.

0:18:00.500,0:18:04.420
Thank you, Jesus.
