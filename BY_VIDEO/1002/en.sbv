SHOCKING: What Happened After I Slept With A Prostitute!!!

0:00:03.360,0:00:12.420
This young man came to The SCOAN from Kaduna in northern Nigeria with a problem of permanent erection,

0:00:12.420,0:00:19.460
diagnosed in his medical report from the Lagos State Government Hospital as priapism.

0:00:19.460,0:00:28.440
Mister Victor Kachiro, although just 24 years of age, has been suffering with this problem for several months.

0:00:28.440,0:00:38.520
He stands still raising his t-shirt, then turns slowly to his left-hand side to show the obvious bulge in his trousers.

0:00:38.520,0:00:46.100
Gently sliding his baggy trousers down, the painful permanent erection is clear to see.

0:00:46.100,0:00:49.500
HEALING TIME

0:00:49.500,0:00:54.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and healing under the control of the Spirit of God

0:00:54.060,0:00:57.680
to people with various afflictions, in need of divine mercy.

0:00:57.680,0:01:00.280
Please, help my son, man of God!

0:01:00.280,0:01:04.160
He met a prostitute and has been having a permanent erection.

0:01:04.160,0:01:06.580
Please, man of God, help my son.

0:01:06.580,0:01:08.120
Help my son, nam of God!

0:01:08.120,0:01:12.400
In the Name of Jesus Christ, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Victor Kachiro

0:01:12.400,0:01:18.900
and the cause of the problem of permanent erection is destroyed by the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:01:18.900,0:01:25.500
He falls to the floor under the Spirit of God's delivering influence, declared free, in Jesus' name.

0:01:25.500,0:01:30.320
He rises to his feet to thank Jesus Christ - his healer.

0:01:30.320,0:01:33.280
Thank You, Jesus, I am free!

0:01:33.280,0:01:37.320
Thank You, Jesus, my son is free!

0:01:37.320,0:01:45.720
Some time later, Mr Victor Kachiro returned to The SCOAN to testify of what the Lord Jesus Christ

0:01:45.720,0:01:51.040
has done in his life after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:51.040,0:01:52.200
Let's watch!

0:01:52.200,0:02:15.000
BEFORE | AFTER

0:02:15.000,0:02:17.500
As you can see now, I am healed.

0:02:17.500,0:02:19.940
I can touch it; I can feel it.

0:02:19.940,0:02:21.820
I don’t feel any pain anymore.

0:02:21.820,0:02:24.680
I couldn’t do this before but now, I can do it.

0:02:24.680,0:02:25.860
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:25.860,0:02:28.060
The erection is gone; everything is gone.

0:02:28.060,0:02:30.420
I am healed – totally healed!

0:02:30.420,0:02:35.140
Thank You, Jesus!
I am healed!

0:02:35.140,0:02:39.900
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:02:39.900,0:02:43.200
My name is Victor Kachiro

0:02:43.200,0:02:48.680
The woman standing next to me is my mum - her name is Rebeca Kachiro.

0:02:48.680,0:02:54.620
This is my dad - mister Kachiro.

0:02:54.620,0:03:03.320
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN  was a permanent erection.

0:03:03.320,0:03:12.940
I had been suffering from this problem since December, 2016 when I went out with my friends.

0:03:12.940,0:03:16.380
We did all sorts of bad things.

0:03:16.380,0:03:23.300
That was what led to the permanent erection.

0:03:23.300,0:03:33.540
This is how it all started: my friends and I would go out and take all sorts of things,

0:03:33.540,0:03:38.280
like drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.

0:03:38.280,0:03:44.140
Then, we would look for prostitute and sleep with them.

0:03:44.140,0:03:52.580
The next day after sleeping with a prostitute, I discovered that my penis was erect

0:03:52.580,0:03:58.740
and was unable to go down; I was in so much pain.

0:03:58.740,0:04:00.380
After that...

0:04:00.380,0:04:06.840
So, just to be clear brother - immediately after you met with this prostitute, under the influence of alcohol,

0:04:06.840,0:04:12.520
smoking, the following morning your erection was permanent and it refused to go down

0:04:12.520,0:04:14.380
and was extremely painful.

0:04:14.380,0:04:16.600
Yes.

0:04:16.600,0:04:30.420
Then, I was taken to hospital where the doctor told me that I had to be operated on.

0:04:30.420,0:04:38.360
After the doctor told me that I was to be operated...

0:04:38.360,0:04:42.700
At that time, I was in pain and had no choice.

0:04:42.700,0:04:51.700
I laid on the bed waiting for them to carry out their procedures.

0:04:51.700,0:05:00.040
When my mum came, I told her what the doctor had said.

0:05:00.040,0:05:13.340
My mum said no, that I couldn’t be operated on as she had faith that God could do it for me.

0:05:13.340,0:05:19.300
I'm sorry brother; when the doctors booked you for an operation, what did they say would happen to you

0:05:19.300,0:05:23.560
after the operation, as a consequence of doing that operation?

0:05:23.560,0:05:34.600
They said that I might become impotent.

0:05:34.600,0:05:40.700
So, the doctors told you that there was a high risk of you becoming impotent, as a result of this operation,

0:05:40.700,0:05:45.760
but because of the pain you were going through, you agreed to it and you were booked for the operation,

0:05:45.760,0:05:48.840
when your mum came and met you at the hospital?

0:05:48.840,0:05:50.780
Yes.

0:05:50.780,0:05:53.280
So, after that...

0:05:53.280,0:06:05.980
They even convinced me that I had the right to decide on my own whether or not to be operated on.

0:06:05.980,0:06:14.160
I then told them that since my mum was there, I would go with what she advised.

0:06:14.160,0:06:20.780
I would go anywhere my mum took me to.

0:06:20.780,0:06:28.540
That day, they even wrote notes about us with a red pen instead of a blue one -

0:06:28.540,0:06:35.300
because they were angry – I don’t know why.

0:06:35.300,0:06:41.440
We went home and the next day, we came to Lagos.

0:06:41.440,0:06:52.700
On the 20th of December, we came to The SCOAN.

0:06:52.700,0:06:58.640
We want to understand; when you came to The SCOAN, you were in this very critical situation, in a lot of pain,

0:06:58.640,0:07:00.820
and Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.

0:07:00.820,0:07:05.160
Can you describe to us what happened when he prayed for you?

0:07:05.160,0:07:16.520
When he prayed for me, I felt so happy and I am relieved.

0:07:16.520,0:07:19.140
Everything in normal.

0:07:19.140,0:07:23.560
I feel like a newborn baby.

0:07:23.560,0:07:24.360
OK.

0:07:24.360,0:07:28.260
So, we saw when he prayed for you, you actually fell to the ground.

0:07:28.260,0:07:32.580
Can you describe what was happening in your body at that moment?

0:07:32.580,0:07:42.400
When he laid his hand on me, firstly, it felt like there was a flash of light on my eyes,

0:07:42.400,0:07:46.040
after which, I fell on the ground.

0:07:46.040,0:07:50.840
While on the ground, I didn't know what was happening.

0:07:50.840,0:07:55.980
I regained full consciousness and found that everything was back to normal!

0:07:55.980,0:07:56.980
- Praise the Lord!
- Amen!

0:07:56.980,0:08:00.340
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:00.340,0:08:06.060
So, you mean to say brother that at that moment the severe, intense pain left and you were relieved?

0:08:06.060,0:08:09.600
And tell us what happened after the prayer.

0:08:09.600,0:08:20.460
After the prayer and regaining full consciousness, I felt normal.

0:08:20.460,0:08:26.660
I went back home and everything was back to normal.
I no longer did the things I used to do.

0:08:26.660,0:08:30.420
I returned fully to my normal self.

0:08:30.420,0:08:36.180
You mean to say that the pain left and then you realised that the erection started reducing

0:08:36.180,0:08:43.000
and finally it returned completely to normal, just a few days after that touch from Jesus Christ?

0:08:43.000,0:08:43.820
Yes.

0:08:43.820,0:08:47.640
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:08:47.640,0:08:52.160
Brother, it has been several months since then; just tell us - does it mean that for this whole period

0:08:52.160,0:08:57.560
you have been living a normal life, freely, without having that pain or permanent erection?

0:08:57.560,0:08:59.040
Yes.

0:08:59.040,0:09:02.320
Everything is...
Yes.

0:09:02.320,0:09:07.140
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:09:07.140,0:09:12.980
To the glory of God; can you just show us, touch the area, so we can see for ourselves the fact

0:09:12.980,0:09:14.700
that everything is normal now?

0:09:14.700,0:09:17.660
You can see it here.

0:09:17.660,0:09:20.180
Everything is back to normal.

0:09:20.180,0:09:25.400
I can jump and bend down now.

0:09:25.400,0:09:30.740
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:09:30.740,0:09:36.500
We can see people laughing but obviously, if you were in his position, you would understand the amount of pain

0:09:36.500,0:09:38.560
he suffered when he was injured,

0:09:38.560,0:09:44.460
even to the extent that doctors actually booked him for an operation because of that situation.

0:09:44.460,0:09:46.800
To the glory of God - he is completely free now.

0:09:46.800,0:09:51.680
Brother, what do you want to advise viewers around the world, especially young people,

0:09:51.680,0:09:57.780
since you acknowledged that it was as a result of influence of bad friends, going out to meet prostitutes,

0:09:57.780,0:10:00.380
smoking and drinking, that led you to this predicament?

0:10:00.380,0:10:03.200
What is your advice to the young people?

0:10:03.200,0:10:13.240
The advice that I want to give to young people is to stay away from bad friends and prostitutes

0:10:13.240,0:10:17.460
because they will make your life miserable.

0:10:17.460,0:10:21.340
Always keep good friends, who will lead you to the right way,

0:10:21.340,0:10:24.640
not bad friends who will lead you to the wrong way

0:10:24.640,0:10:29.320
because they will not help you in your future; they cannot help matters.

0:10:29.320,0:10:35.260
Always follow the Scripture and keep it in your heart.

0:10:35.260,0:10:39.260
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:39.260,0:10:41.420
That is an advice born of life experience.

0:10:41.420,0:10:45.120
We believe that our brothers and sisters around the world are listening what our brother has to say.

0:10:45.120,0:10:47.000
Let's quickly hear a word from your mum.

0:10:47.000,0:10:50.300
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:10:50.300,0:10:52.360
Children of God; Emmanuel!

0:10:52.360,0:10:57.200
I am Mrs Rebecca Kachiro.
I am from Kaduna State.

0:10:57.200,0:10:59.520
That is my lovely husband there,

0:10:59.520,0:11:01.060
and this is my son.

0:11:01.060,0:11:04.560
I am a mother of six - this is my fourth born.

0:11:04.560,0:11:05.980
It all happened...

0:11:05.980,0:11:10.760
He lives quite a distance away from us.

0:11:10.760,0:11:13.780
I had received a phone call that he was sick.

0:11:13.780,0:11:19.760
It was as if they were trying to hide it from me; they didn’t want me to know the actual problem.

0:11:19.760,0:11:23.840
Because of the pain he was in, he had agreed to be operated upon.

0:11:23.840,0:11:28.640
To God be the glory, it was a divine arrangement.

0:11:28.640,0:11:34.360
He was supposed to be taken to theatre that fateful day at 9am.

0:11:34.360,0:11:39.280
But I left Kaduna at 10:30am.

0:11:39.280,0:11:45.220
They did not take him to theatre before I arrived.

0:11:45.220,0:11:52.720
When I arrived, I told them that no, this boy would not be operated on.

0:11:52.720,0:11:56.360
They asked me why and I replied that my faith was not in the hospital.

0:11:56.360,0:12:02.760
To God be the glory, I overheard the doctors discussing among themselves

0:12:02.760,0:12:08.680
that they would operate on him and everything would go well

0:12:08.680,0:12:12.360
but that there was the risk that he would become impotent.

0:12:12.360,0:12:16.780
I then told my husband what the doctors had said.

0:12:16.780,0:12:20.340
He asked, "Since the boy is in pain, what do we do?"

0:12:20.340,0:12:22.540
I said no, that God would do something.

0:12:22.540,0:12:27.600
I pleaded; they took me to the general manager of the hospital to convince me

0:12:27.600,0:12:30.380
that my boy should undergo the operation.

0:12:30.380,0:12:33.920
I told them that my faith was not in the hospital,

0:12:33.920,0:12:35.880
that they should allow me to take the boy to church.

0:12:35.880,0:12:40.000
So, that was how in the end, God won the battle for me.

0:12:40.000,0:12:43.440
They took him to theatre to force him to be operated on.

0:12:43.440,0:12:47.820
I saw him coming out saying, "Madam, since you..."...

0:12:47.820,0:12:53.380
They gave me a document and asked me to sign it.

0:12:53.380,0:13:00.520
I insisted on reading the wording before I signed it.

0:13:00.520,0:13:11.000
It stated that I would take full responsibility in the event that anything happened to him.

0:13:11.000,0:13:16.880
I told them that I would come back to that hospital with a testimony.

0:13:16.880,0:13:19.200
Praise the Lord!

0:13:19.200,0:13:21.800
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:13:21.800,0:13:23.860
We thank God for our mother's faith.

0:13:23.860,0:13:28.360
She realised that this problem was not just a natural problem but a spiritual one.

0:13:28.360,0:13:32.440
We all know that doctors treat but Jesus Christ cures.

0:13:32.440,0:13:38.000
Doctors are playing a wonderful role in helping many people but our mother realised that the case of her son

0:13:38.000,0:13:43.960
was not a natural situation but a spiritual situation, that required divine intervention.

0:13:43.960,0:13:47.900
Madam, when you brought your son to The SCOAN and he received prayer;

0:13:47.900,0:13:52.440
can you just tell us what happened and what are the changes that you saw in his life thereafter?

0:13:52.440,0:13:54.160
Praise the Lord!

0:13:54.160,0:13:59.840
When we came to The SCOAN, my son was placed at the prayer line.

0:13:59.840,0:14:06.700
During the prayer, he fainted and I knew that something had happened.

0:14:06.700,0:14:10.820
On reaching home, after six days, everything became normal.

0:14:10.820,0:14:13.180
Praise the Lord!

0:14:13.180,0:14:18.100
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.

0:14:18.100,0:14:19.400
Thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:14:19.400,0:14:20.520
We give all the glory to God.

0:14:20.520,0:14:25.440
Madam, in the lights of what God has done for your son, what is your own word of advice for our viewers?

0:14:25.440,0:14:27.100
Praise the Lord!

0:14:27.100,0:14:30.460
Parents, I want you to take note of your children.

0:14:30.460,0:14:35.660
Observe their movements; observe the type of friends they keep.

0:14:35.660,0:14:42.440
You may not follow them everywhere they go but you can render prayers.

0:14:42.440,0:14:49.620
I took a bold step believing that I have a God who would answer and deliver him.

0:14:49.620,0:14:54.300
Inside me, I felt that the operation was not going to be successful.

0:14:54.300,0:14:57.360
So, I want to address mothers especially.

0:14:57.360,0:15:00.200
Mothers, say "Praise the Lord!"

0:15:00.200,0:15:01.660
Mothers have a lot to do.

0:15:01.660,0:15:03.240
Men are often too busy.

0:15:03.240,0:15:06.840
As a mother, it is your duty to do good work.

0:15:06.840,0:15:10.140
Your husband is just like a baby in your hands - I always say this.

0:15:10.140,0:15:13.900
Especially your children, they are little babies, no matter how they have grown.

0:15:13.900,0:15:19.780
You have to decide for them in some issues, especially in terms of spiritual battle.

0:15:19.780,0:15:25.940
So, I believe that if we follow these tips, God will see us through, in Jesus' name.

0:15:25.940,0:15:30.080
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:30.080,0:15:34.520
Finally, let's hear a word from the father of the young man as well.

0:15:34.520,0:15:35.260
Sir, you are welcome.

0:15:35.260,0:15:41.320
Please, introduce yourself to us and tell us what can you say about this wonderful testimony.

0:15:41.320,0:15:43.980
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:15:43.980,0:15:48.860
My name is Anthony Dennis Kachiro.

0:15:48.860,0:15:51.340
We are all from Kaduna State.

0:15:51.340,0:15:56.020
He is Victor Kachiro, my fourth son,

0:15:56.020,0:15:59.260
and this is my darling; wife Rebecca Kachiro.

0:15:59.260,0:16:15.160
The devil wanted to enter the family but with the faith that my wife had, we were able to succeed.

0:16:15.160,0:16:20.680
It was one morning, when I was preparing to go to work for an assignment

0:16:20.680,0:16:27.780
that I received a phone call that my son had been taken to the general hospital.

0:16:27.780,0:16:33.360
I tried to ask them what the matter was because I hadn't had any reported case of ill health.

0:16:33.360,0:16:37.980
Then, the person who tried to tell me said that it was something very strange.

0:16:37.980,0:16:44.620
I became so confused and told my wife to rush to the hospital.

0:16:44.620,0:16:50.440
She went after analysing and seeing everything and then called me on the phone,

0:16:50.440,0:16:54.780
and told me that they were talking about an operation.

0:16:54.780,0:16:59.500
I reminded her that she had told me he was in serious pain

0:16:59.500,0:17:03.400
and asked her what she wanted us to do, that why couldn't she just allow them to operate

0:17:03.400,0:17:10.980
but she insisted that he had to be taken for prayers in The SCOAN.

0:17:10.980,0:17:13.600
So, I accepted.

0:17:13.600,0:17:16.840
I have to thank God for making this possible.

0:17:16.840,0:17:20.740
She came and we made arrangements.

0:17:20.740,0:17:24.220
That is exactly what has happened.

0:17:24.220,0:17:32.700
I want to say that she has encouraged me and encouraged the family

0:17:32.700,0:17:37.520
because we were all confused at that stage.

0:17:37.520,0:17:41.000
So, once again, we can understand how critical the situation was.

0:17:41.000,0:17:44.080
Glory be to God that your son came to The SCOAN.

0:17:44.080,0:17:50.740
Sir, what can you say about the transformation in his life through the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:17:50.740,0:17:54.380
There was a transformation, not only concerning the sickness

0:17:54.380,0:17:57.760
but also concerning some of the issues we were confronting.

0:17:57.760,0:18:02.340
As soon as he was prayed for, when he received his healing,

0:18:02.340,0:18:05.600
he became strong and everything was so much in order.

0:18:05.600,0:18:12.020
There were some things that some of his brothers could not do that he, wholeheartedly,

0:18:12.020,0:18:18.620
had engaged himself in doing – all those things that we had been missing from a son.

0:18:18.620,0:18:19.320
Amen.

0:18:19.320,0:18:23.440
So, you mean to say he was completely restored, the permanent erection went after the prayer,

0:18:23.440,0:18:27.000
he has now been living a normal life for several months?

0:18:27.000,0:18:28.820
Yes.

0:18:28.820,0:18:30.120
Exactly, glory be to God.

0:18:30.120,0:18:32.480
Finally sir, what is your own word of advice?

0:18:32.480,0:18:40.860
I want to advise all youth that they should always try to follow things gradually.

0:18:40.860,0:18:47.300
Going into these vices of smoking, drinking and doing what they are not supposed to do will not help them.

0:18:47.300,0:18:55.040
Rather, they are to hold fast to their studies so they would be able to achieve and build a family.

0:18:55.040,0:19:01.120
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
