0:00:00.000,0:00:03.400
Good morning Church?

0:00:03.400,0:00:05.200
Thank you!

0:00:05.200,0:00:09.100
You may be seated, thank you!

0:00:09.100,0:00:11.800
Good morning once again?

0:00:11.800,0:00:16.800
I want to say good morning to the viewers all over the world!

0:00:16.800,0:00:21.400
I don't see myself leaving the word faith.

0:00:21.400,0:00:25.600
So let us begin where we stopped the last message.

0:00:25.600,0:00:30.600
Message Title: Talk on Faith!

0:00:30.600,0:00:42.200
Let's take our reading from the book of matthew - that is the first book of the new testament.

0:00:42.200,0:00:47.000
[MATTHEW 21:18]

0:00:47.000,0:00:50.800
'Jesus cursed a fig tree.'

0:00:50.800,0:01:00.100
18 Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.

0:01:00.100,0:01:12.400
"Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves.

0:01:12.400,0:01:23.100
Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!”

0:01:23.100,0:01:32.200
Because he could not find anything on the tree, except leaves. Jesus said to the tree

0:01:32.200,0:01:39.200
“May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered

0:01:39.200,0:01:46.100
Immediately the tree withered, when the disciples saw this,

0:01:46.100,0:01:53.700
they were amazed - surprised, what a manner of man is this?

0:01:53.700,0:02:00.380
"How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" They thought.

0:02:00.380,0:02:09.300
Jesus replied, "truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt."

0:02:09.300,0:02:14.500
Not only can you do what was done to the fig tree

0:02:14.500,0:02:24.200
but also you can say to this mountain, "Go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done."

0:02:24.200,0:02:26.800
Think about that.

0:02:26.800,0:02:31.100
The last verse - Are you there?

0:02:31.100,0:02:33.500
That is verse 22

0:02:33.500,0:02:46.900
"If you believe you will receive whatever you ask in prayer" can that be true of you?

0:02:46.900,0:02:49.500
That is the question.

0:02:49.500,0:02:59.400
"If you believe you will receive whatever you ask in prayer" can that be true of you?

0:02:59.400,0:03:07.400
That is the question you need to ask. Ask your neighbor, can that be true of you?

0:03:07.400,0:03:17.600
The bible says,"If you believe you will receive whatever you ask in prayer" can that be true of you?

0:03:17.600,0:03:30.200
Because the word believe is not an application, but faith is an application.

0:03:30.200,0:03:44.800
Faith is a demonstration. Faith is a conviction. Faith is an application - you want to apply.

0:03:44.800,0:03:51.600
We can only apply all of God's blessing through faith.

0:03:51.600,0:04:00.800
If you say you believe, show me your faith.

0:04:00.800,0:04:10.000
"I believe" - show me your faith.

0:04:10.000,0:04:21.000
This is a question of the heart.

0:04:21.000,0:04:27.200
This is a question of what? - The heart.

0:04:27.200,0:04:34.200
Faith is of man's heart.

0:04:34.200,0:04:40.100
You may believe and not be able to express your faith.

0:04:40.100,0:04:47.600
Anyone can believe but not everyone can express their faith.

0:04:47.600,0:04:55.300
Many claim that they are believers, but they do not know how to believe and express their faith.

0:04:55.300,0:04:58.000
That is what is going on all over the world.

0:04:58.000,0:05:05.600
Everyone here say that they are believers, if they ask you, you say "I am are a believer."

0:05:05.600,0:05:13.700
But you do not know how to believe and express your faith!

0:05:13.700,0:05:25.400
Faith is an application. Faith is a demonstration. Faith is a conviction. Faith is practical.

0:05:25.400,0:05:29.000
That is the word practical - REALITY.

0:05:29.000,0:05:37.400
Yes, I can see this fruit - that is believe.

0:05:37.400,0:05:41.100
Yes, this is fruit in my hand - that is faith.

0:05:41.100,0:05:43.160
That is you and Jesus

0:05:43.160,0:05:52.500
I will demonstrate again, your relationship with Jesus; those who claim they are believers.

0:05:52.500,0:05:56.600
Yes, that is fruit, I believe it is fruit.

0:05:56.600,0:06:01.300
Yes!, it is fruit, this is fruit, it is fruit.

0:06:01.300,0:06:05.000
The word faith now,

0:06:05.000,0:06:08.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:08.300,0:06:13.800
This is faith now - you have faith to take it.

0:06:13.800,0:06:20.600
Without faith, you will continue to see the power, deliverance and all of God's blessings.

0:06:20.600,0:06:29.000
But you will not be able to apply them to yourself or make them manifest in you.

0:06:29.000,0:06:34.200
It is by faith we make all of God's blessings manifest in us.

0:06:34.200,0:06:40.500
By faith, we can apply all of God's blessings.

0:06:40.500,0:06:47.100
Faith is a question of the heart - whom we trust.

0:06:47.100,0:06:54.300
You can say, "I believe", but you believe not with your heart.

0:06:54.300,0:06:58.400
PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA - The Synagogue Church of All Nations.

0:06:58.400,0:07:16.300
For every matter, there are promises in the Bible - that God will do for us as long as we have faith.

0:07:16.300,0:07:29.400
Work without faith is dead, in the same way faith without work is dead.

0:07:29.400,0:07:39.200
What we do expresses what we believe.

0:07:39.200,0:07:47.400
The matter is quite simple - faith is expressed through work.

0:07:47.400,0:08:09.100
Faith work together with its work; by this faith is perfected, proved and completed.

0:08:09.100,0:08:17.700
If you say you believe, where is your faith?

0:08:17.700,0:08:23.700
Because faith is practical.

0:08:23.700,0:08:28.700
The belief in your heart is released by faith.

0:08:28.700,0:08:41.000
The belief in our heart can only be released by faith, if not your belief will remain dormant, inactive.

0:08:41.000,0:08:49.300
Ok, you can believe but it is dormant. If our belief remains dormant; what is dormant is what?

0:08:49.300,0:09:02.000
If you say you have money and you cannot spend it, do you have money?

0:09:02.000,0:09:04.500
Can you say you have money?

0:09:04.500,0:09:08.400
Because you need money it means you will be borrowing money.

0:09:08.400,0:09:13.505
When you have money and you cannot spend it, it means you will be borrowing money.

0:09:13.505,0:09:15.200
You will become a debtor.

0:09:15.200,0:09:21.300
So, the belief in our heart can only be released by faith.

0:09:21.300,0:09:28.300
When you don't have faith, the belief in your heart will remain dormant.

0:09:28.300,0:09:30.700
Are you a christian?

0:09:30.700,0:09:37.400
When there is no faith, the belief in your heart will remain dormant.

0:09:37.400,0:09:42.900
So how will you call Jesus, how will you talk to Jesus when the belief in your heart is dormant?

0:09:42.900,0:09:50.700
In Jesus name, you need faith; but there is no faith to release the belief.

0:09:50.700,0:09:55.500
You can only say amen, by faith you release the belief in your heart.

0:09:55.500,0:09:58.500
But it is not released.

0:09:58.500,0:10:03.320
"Thank you Jesus" you can only say this when faith releases the belief in your heart.

0:10:03.320,0:10:07.300
but the believe in your heart is dormant.

0:10:07.300,0:10:20.200
This is why I said, many claim to be believers but do not know how to believe and express their faith.

0:10:20.200,0:10:29.600
They claim to be believers but they do not know how to believe and express their faith.

0:10:29.600,0:10:33.100
You believe in God in a certain matter.

0:10:33.100,0:10:38.300
You should have the work of faith in that matter.

0:10:38.300,0:10:59.700
Tell your neighbor, if you believe in God in a certain matter, you should have the work of faith in that matter.

0:10:59.700,0:11:01.600
Faith without work is dead.

0:11:01.600,0:11:07.500
It means without the work of faith, that belief is dead.

0:11:07.500,0:11:11.900
And what is the work of faith? That is the question.

0:11:11.900,0:11:15.700
The work of faith can simply be defined in this way:

0:11:15.700,0:11:23.900
Absolute trust in God that he is now working out the answer.

0:11:23.900,0:11:26.600
That is the work of faith.

0:11:26.600,0:11:56.500
Tell your neighbor again, absolute trust in God that he is now working out the answer.

0:11:56.500,0:12:00.100
That is the work of faith!

0:12:00.100,0:12:08.700
If a man says he believes that God is working for him,

0:12:08.700,0:12:25.500
but he is busy making his own plans, worrying and distressed this is false faith.

0:12:25.500,0:12:31.700
I am about to go out and I realized that the cloud was dark and it is about to rain.

0:12:31.700,0:12:38.960
I now moved into my bedroom and begin to pray,

0:12:38.960,0:12:51.400
"Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus - I don't want this rain, I want to go to my work, help me stop this rain,Thank you Jesus!"

0:12:51.400,0:12:56.500
Then I say God has answered my prayer and I now move and

0:12:56.500,0:13:03.500
say to my family thank you I am going to work. It will not rain I have prayed to God.

0:13:03.500,0:13:11.000
God said to me it will not rain and at the same time I move towards an umbrella.

0:13:11.000,0:13:13.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:13.300,0:13:23.700
and I put it inside my bag, and I say "Thank you Jesus." {Singing}

0:13:23.700,0:13:30.500
and I am going to work. What does that umbrella mean?

0:13:30.500,0:13:33.300
In case of what? [It rains]

0:13:33.300,0:13:36.000
That has nullified my what? [My belief]

0:13:36.000,0:13:43.000
My belief.

0:13:43.000,0:13:44.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:44.900,0:13:49.500
That alone has nullified my belief.

0:13:49.500,0:14:00.400
Because if I actually believe in a certain matter, I must have the work of faith in that matter.

0:14:00.400,0:14:03.700
Carrying an umbrella is not the work of faith.

0:14:03.700,0:14:12.500
The work of faith is an absolute trust in Him that he is now working out the answer.

0:14:12.500,0:14:15.000
Is that not the life we live?

0:14:15.000,0:14:17.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:17.200,0:14:27.400
You pray over some trouble which arises in your life,

0:14:27.400,0:14:45.900
And later you find yourself full of anxiety and worries. As if you have never prayed before.

0:14:45.900,0:15:09.700
Prayer should be followed by an absolute trust in Him that he is now working out the answer.

0:15:09.700,0:15:20.200
Tell your neighbor - Prayer should be followed by an absolute trust in God

0:15:20.200,0:15:25.200
that he is now working out the answer.

0:15:25.200,0:15:33.600
Yes, after you finish praying what should follow is an absolute trust.

0:15:33.600,0:15:38.440
'Jesus, Jesus, thank you Lord, thank you Lord' What are you thanking him for

0:15:38.440,0:15:42.500
when you know he has not answered your prayer?

0:15:42.500,0:15:51.300
If you know you have not received, why are you saying thank you Jesus, because every prayer ends by what?

0:15:51.300,0:16:00.600
If you have not received teaching, the promise of the father - the Holy Spirit, in your spirit;

0:16:00.600,0:16:09.500
forcing yourself to do such acts indeed is a risk.

0:16:09.500,0:16:18.900
That is where your problem comes from - forcing yourself to do such acts indeed is a risk.

0:16:18.900,0:16:26.900
I believe that many of us have not received the promise of the father in our spirit.

0:16:26.900,0:16:30.800
You need to be grounded in the word of God.

0:16:30.800,0:16:33.600
Faith comes by hearing.

0:16:33.600,0:16:42.000
Since we have not heard and obeyed enough you cannot act in faith.

0:16:42.000,0:16:43.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:43.480,0:16:47.000
That is where our problem comes from, you might have heard the word;

0:16:47.000,0:16:50.800
but you have not obeyed what you heard.

0:16:50.800,0:16:58.300
You hear it to teach it, you hear it to practice it but not hear it to live it.

0:16:58.300,0:17:03.900
Like the father of the demon possessed boy, he said, "I believe help my unbelief.

0:17:03.900,0:17:06.800
He was acting like us then.

0:17:06.800,0:17:13.100
He was acting like us, that is why he said to Jesus, "I believe, help my unbelief."

0:17:13.100,0:17:17.000
That kind of belief is like the belief we have today.

0:17:17.000,0:17:19.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:19.100,0:17:22.300
This is what the father of the demon possessed boy said to Jesus,

0:17:22.300,0:17:28.400
"I believe, help my unbelief," what kind of belief again?

0:17:28.400,0:17:32.200
If you believe and you are asking to help your unbelief,

0:17:32.200,0:17:41.300
it means the belief he had was the one of hearing the word of God to preach and to teach.

0:17:41.300,0:17:44.900
Not to live the Word.

0:17:44.900,0:17:50.000
If you hear the word of God and live it you will act in faith.

0:17:50.000,0:17:58.200
So, this is why we keep seeing the present darkness.

0:17:58.200,0:18:07.200
Physical eyes will always and continue to see the present darkness.

0:18:07.200,0:18:13.300
And the eyes of faith will always see the light.

0:18:13.300,0:18:20.080
The present darkness is the situation you are in now, your challenges are the present darkness.

0:18:20.080,0:18:24.800
This is the only thing you can see, you can't see beyond your situation.

0:18:24.800,0:18:34.800
That is why you lament, cry, doubt, become sober, anxious and worried

0:18:34.800,0:18:40.900
because all you can see is your present darkness.

0:18:40.900,0:18:44.700
You cannot see beyond your present darkness.

0:18:44.700,0:18:53.200
Assuming you have faith, you will be able to see the light.

0:18:53.200,0:19:04.800
Physical eyes can only see what? Present darkness! Tell your neighbor [...]

0:19:04.800,0:19:23.000
Our sight can only see the present darkness, but the eyes of faith can see the light.

0:19:23.000,0:19:24.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:24.900,0:19:31.700
And what is the present darkness? Your situation right now.

0:19:31.700,0:19:37.720
I call it present darkness because as soon as you change, you have faith,

0:19:37.720,0:19:42.280
you are converted through conversion - It's gone!

0:19:42.280,0:19:45.500
Because it is not something that is going to permanent.

0:19:45.500,0:19:48.900
Once you change, the situation changes.

0:19:48.900,0:19:52.200
That is why I call it present darkness.

0:19:52.200,0:19:57.400
Your sight can only see the present darkness.

0:19:57.400,0:20:02.200
And this is what you are seeing and is worrying you. You are thinking of this;

0:20:02.200,0:20:09.840
of hardship, limitation, poverty, sickness, infirmity, of the message you received,

0:20:09.840,0:20:18.000
nightmare, the phone call you received this is your present darkness you are battling with.

0:20:18.000,0:20:21.400
And as the result of your sight.

0:20:21.400,0:20:28.800
If I lived the way you have been living - you will not meet me here today.

0:20:28.800,0:20:39.000
Situations, challenges, what you people have done to me and what you people are thinking of doing to me,

0:20:39.000,0:20:44.500
this will not allow me to stand here to address you because I would be worried and thinking.

0:20:44.500,0:20:53.000
But I cannot see my present darkness at all, all I see is light.

0:20:53.000,0:20:56.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:56.740,0:21:02.800
And now that I am only seeing the light, it means that God is going to take care of any...

0:21:02.800,0:21:06.600
any darkness that appears to be darkness.

0:21:06.600,0:21:10.300
But you are seeing them and they are disturbing you,

0:21:10.300,0:21:18.100
you are being disturbed by your challenges and by all sorts of situation - you are worried.

0:21:18.100,0:21:24.100
Even when Jesus stands by you and you are seeing your present darkness - you will be worried.

0:21:24.100,0:21:27.900
I would like to know about it, what is going to happen next?

0:21:27.900,0:21:31.200
I don't know what will happen, will I overcome this situation?

0:21:31.200,0:21:36.440
How will I overcome the situation? The nightmare is too much, I am having pain,

0:21:36.460,0:21:43.200
my doctor says I should go and write my will, this is a deadly disease; what will I do about it?

0:21:43.200,0:21:48.900
This debt - how will I pay this debt? I don't know how to pay, there is no future, there is no hope.

0:21:48.900,0:21:51.800
Everything seems so rough.

0:21:51.800,0:21:59.200
Under that atmosphere you cannot have faith - you cannot express your faith, it is not possible.

0:21:59.200,0:22:03.300
You can only express your faith when you see the light,

0:22:03.300,0:22:11.000
but seeing the present darkness, it is difficult to express your faith.

0:22:11.000,0:22:13.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:13.800,0:22:17.900
Faith demands for a free spirit.

0:22:17.900,0:22:22.000
tell your neighbor!

0:22:22.000,0:22:30.300
But your spirit is not free; your spirit is in bondage, in prison.

0:22:30.300,0:22:41.300
Free spirit. Faith demands for a free spirit but your spirit is not free.

0:22:41.300,0:22:44.000
Your spirit is not free.

0:22:44.000,0:22:55.000
You need a free spirit to attract God.

0:22:55.020,0:23:04.200
So, this is why I said since you have not received the promise of the Father in your spirit.

0:23:04.200,0:23:08.500
Or you have not been grounded in the Word of God.

0:23:08.520,0:23:17.800
To be grounded in the Word of God is to have your spirit join himself with God's spirit.

0:23:17.860,0:23:29.000
That will now declare you a true born again. Not the kind of born again we talk about today.

0:23:34.300,0:23:43.800
This is a question of the heart: Whom do you trust?

0:23:43.800,0:23:52.000
This is why we need to struggle to believe.

0:23:52.000,0:23:54.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:54.980,0:24:00.200
And there is no need for us to struggle to believe.

0:24:00.220,0:24:12.400
You have to struggle, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. You have to struggle to believe, and there is nothing like that.

0:24:12.400,0:24:18.000
It happens naturally instead you have to struggle to believe.

0:24:18.000,0:24:29.600
We don't need to struggle to believe.

0:24:29.620,0:24:40.300
This is the way with all kinds of faith.

0:24:40.300,0:24:48.200
It is when you have problems that you fast, you run here and there to the church, I mean...

0:24:48.200,0:24:51.360
many of us were supposed to be here a long time ago.

0:24:51.360,0:24:55.360
But because problems became overwhelming we run down to the church.

0:24:55.360,0:25:00.661
When the trouble has not become too much for you, you consult your elders,

0:25:00.661,0:25:05.600
'pharisees and sadducees for advice - where to go.

0:25:05.660,0:25:12.240
But when you now have so many problems and you know these problems may likely take your life,

0:25:12.240,0:25:21.000
you don't need to consult them, you go on your own. This is the way with all kinds of faith.

0:25:21.000,0:25:27.000
Anything that comes by force is not faith.

0:25:27.000,0:25:37.600
Faith is something that comes spontaneously - that is naturally. That is faith!

0:25:37.680,0:25:41.120
Who will open the door for the belief that you have?

0:25:41.120,0:25:45.000
The belief is inside the box, being locked.

0:25:45.000,0:25:51.000
Faith locked the belief and puts the key in the pocket.

0:25:51.000,0:25:58.800
For the belief to come out, faith needs to bring out the key and open the door for the belief to come out.

0:25:58.800,0:26:16.000
You have the belief but no faith. So your belief is dormant inside the box - it is inactive.

0:26:16.000,0:26:26.300
Christianity is not mere talk; we should put it into practice.

0:26:26.360,0:26:33.800
Its a thing of the heart, christianity lies in the heart.

0:26:33.800,0:26:37.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:37.100,0:26:39.900
May God bless His Word.

0:26:39.960,0:26:44.000
Rise up for prayer!

0:26:44.000,0:26:47.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:47.440,0:26:57.900
We need to talk to our heart. This is a question of the heart, whom do you trust?

0:26:57.940,0:27:03.200
If I ask you, you will say you trust Jesus!

0:27:03.200,0:27:08.300
Will you allow your heart to talk instead of you talking.

0:27:08.300,0:27:15.200
If I ask, "Whom do you trust?" you will say "Jesus." Which is quite different from what your heart trusts.

0:27:15.200,0:27:21.100
This is a question of the heart, tell your neighbor.     [This is a question of the heart.]

0:27:21.100,0:27:29.840
Christianity is a question of the heart.

0:27:29.840,0:27:32.800
When you are asked, "Who are you?" You say, "I am a christian".

0:27:32.880,0:27:38.800
Anybody can confess this and profess what is not in the heart.

0:27:38.800,0:27:54.000
It is a question of the heart, will you allow your heart to talk? Because faith is of man's heart.

0:27:54.000,0:28:04.000
Whom do you trust? Because faith is a trust. Tell your neighbor, [faith is a trust]

0:28:04.000,0:28:14.400
For you to struggle to believe is wrong. There is nothing like that, that struggle has ended over there!

0:28:14.400,0:28:19.900
You know the state where Peter's struggles ended.

0:28:19.900,0:28:25.300
When Peter saw Jesus on the sea, he said, "I want to come with you."

0:28:25.300,0:28:33.700
He started by putting his leg inside the water and was going inside the sea to meet Jesus.

0:28:33.700,0:28:38.800
As he was going, he was sinking, he was sinking; that is struggle.

0:28:38.800,0:28:46.600
He was sinking, he was sinking until the water level was here!

0:28:46.600,0:28:50.000
And Jesus said, "Come!"

0:28:50.000,0:28:57.200
He was still sinking and Jesus allowed him to struggle until the water level was here.

0:28:57.200,0:29:06.000
When the water level was above him and Jesus was only seeing his hands and fingers.

0:29:06.000,0:29:14.000
Jesus said, Yes! I can see your genuine willingness.

0:29:14.000,0:29:24.100
He said, "Come up!" [Clapping]

0:29:24.100,0:29:32.100
I know you need to struggle before Jesus notices you, and that struggle must be genuine.

0:29:32.100,0:29:39.200
You must struggle, your struggle will not impair you, but improve you!

0:29:39.200,0:29:43.000
So this is just the case.

0:29:43.000,0:29:50.100
Like I said, what you are seeing is present darkness.

0:29:50.100,0:29:59.800
And the moment you give all and surrender to Jesus you will begin to see the light.

0:29:59.800,0:30:02.000
Are you ready?

0:30:02.000,0:30:07.200
You just have to see beyond this present darkness.

0:30:07.200,0:30:17.300
Listen to the voice of God, someone is just changing your history. [AMEN!]

0:30:17.300,0:30:24.000
Let your story change!

0:30:24.000,0:30:28.400
Story of your health - change!

0:30:28.400,0:30:32.200
Story of your career - change!

0:30:32.200,0:30:35.600
Story of your business - change!

0:30:35.600,0:30:39.020
Story of your finances - change!

0:30:39.020,0:30:42.600
Story of your marriage - change!

0:30:42.600,0:31:01.600
Let your story change - In Jesus Name!

0:31:01.600,0:31:09.100
When your story changes, you will no longer see the present darkness!

0:31:09.100,0:31:21.400
This is the voice of God: Whatever is the story of your health - receive a new dream!

0:31:21.400,0:31:25.200
Breakthrough is a new dream.

0:31:25.200,0:31:31.300
Whatever is the story of your career - receive a new dream!

0:31:31.300,0:31:34.600
Prosperity is a new dream.

0:31:34.600,0:31:54.200
It's your new dream - receive a new dream!

0:31:54.200,0:32:01.600
Whatever is the story I don't want to know - up and down stories.

0:32:01.600,0:32:08.100
You know where you are supposed to be going by your effort.

0:32:08.100,0:32:13.400
You know where you are supposed to be going by your struggles.

0:32:13.400,0:32:29.800
You know where you are supposed to be. Let your story change!

0:32:29.800,0:32:41.800
Yes, going by your effort and struggles you know where you are supposed to be and where you belong.

0:32:41.800,0:32:45.400
You know!

0:32:45.400,0:33:02.000
Day and night effort to make it happen - It is the will of God to change your story!

0:33:02.000,0:33:09.100
Each time you sit down on your own, you keep asking yourself

0:33:09.100,0:33:12.600
How long shall we continue like this?

0:33:12.600,0:33:19.500
You have exhausted all your effort, tactics and strategies.

0:33:19.500,0:33:26.200
You thought when you've studied, thought when you've traveled to America, Europe all over the world,

0:33:26.200,0:33:29.500
you thought when you've had a good partner;

0:33:29.500,0:33:34.700
you would have what we call rest.

0:33:34.700,0:33:41.500
Yet, you are still struggling, at this moment you don't know what to do next.

0:33:41.500,0:33:51.700
This is why you run to God and say, "God I have exhausted all my strategies and tactics,

0:33:51.700,0:34:02.900
I have applied every intelligence and effort, I have done this and that I don't know what to do next."

0:34:02.900,0:34:09.600
"Rescue me lord!"

0:34:09.600,0:34:14.400
Rescue me lord and rewrite my history!

0:34:14.400,0:34:32.040
Rescue me lord and change my story!

0:34:32.040,0:34:37.000
Rescue my marriage, and change the history!

0:34:37.000,0:34:41.400
Rescue my business, and change the history!

0:34:41.400,0:34:46.300
Rescue my career, and change the history!

0:34:46.300,0:35:07.000
Rescue my finances, and change the history! In Jesus Christ Name!

0:35:07.000,0:35:08.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:08.020,0:35:27.200
Until you realize that, "No, I need someone wiser, smarter, cleverer." Who is Jesus!

0:35:27.200,0:35:47.800
{There is a wonderful name - Jesus!}

0:35:47.800,0:35:55.800
{There is no other name I know!}
