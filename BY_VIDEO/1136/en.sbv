0:00:00.000,0:00:01.800
My name is Cynthia.

0:00:01.800,0:00:05.960
I am one of the thousands of Nigerians that were deported from Libya.

0:00:05.960,0:00:10.840
These are my colleagues; we came back from Libya together.

0:00:10.840,0:00:16.620
I went to Libya 8 years ago; I was 18 years old at that time.

0:00:16.620,0:00:20.820
I didn't know anything, I was still very young.

0:00:20.820,0:00:25.620
At that point in time, I was learning hair dressing.

0:00:25.620,0:00:34.480
I was dating a particular guy at that point in time who then told me about the journey to Libya.

0:00:34.480,0:00:39.480
He gave me some connection; that if I go, I will be able to make it over there.

0:00:39.480,0:00:44.240
I closed my salon and everything and followed him.

0:00:44.240,0:00:54.560
When we got there, he sold me to a Nigerian woman who was into human trafficking.

0:00:54.560,0:01:06.640
We could sleep with 20 - 30 men a day, just to be able to pay the money.

0:01:06.640,0:01:10.340
I was so depressed and didn't know what to do.

0:01:10.360,0:01:13.060
They told me that if I didn't pay the money,

0:01:13.060,0:01:18.160
they would kill me and throw my body into the desert

0:01:18.160,0:01:21.320
where my family members would never hear from me again.

0:01:21.320,0:01:24.640
So I had no option but to just do the job.

0:01:24.640,0:01:28.320
While in the house there, we heard gunshots.

0:01:28.320,0:01:32.940
Everybody had it in their mind to run; who could run, would run.

0:01:32.940,0:01:35.840
I was not able to run and they caught me.

0:01:35.840,0:01:40.780
While in prison, the wardens that were taking care of us

0:01:40.780,0:01:44.180
were talking to some Nigerians there.

0:01:44.180,0:01:48.780
While they were talking to a Nigerian and threatening him with a gun,

0:01:48.780,0:01:52.280
that was how I was being shot on my leg.

0:01:52.280,0:01:55.460
On my left leg.

0:01:55.460,0:01:58.620
There was no treatment over there.

0:01:58.620,0:02:03.680
I just stayed there, staying in one position for almost 4 months.

0:02:03.680,0:02:07.200
I was not able to walk or do anything by myself.

0:02:07.200,0:02:09.020
I was just in one position.

0:02:09.020,0:02:16.640
With the assistance of my friends and colleagues, I was able to go to the bathroom.

0:02:16.640,0:02:19.720
It affected my hands, I couldn't move my hands.

0:02:19.720,0:02:25.480
I decided to return to Nigeria.

0:02:25.480,0:02:31.640
One day, I was very sick over there, whilst working for the woman.

0:02:31.640,0:02:36.540
The sickness affected me and I had to cut my hair.

0:02:36.540,0:02:39.200
I was very weak and I was losing strength.

0:02:39.200,0:02:44.500
I begged the woman that I couldn't work for that day, that she should pardon me.

0:02:44.500,0:02:45.920
She refused.

0:02:45.920,0:02:51.540
She used the stick that is used to turn 'eba' to beat me severely

0:02:51.540,0:02:55.100
and put ground pepper in my private part.

0:02:55.100,0:03:00.380
I started rolling on the floor, screaming and 
shouting for help

0:03:00.380,0:03:03.060
but I didn't see anybody that would help me.

0:03:03.060,0:03:06.640
She sat down there, seeing me rolling, screaming and shouting.

0:03:06.640,0:03:08.520
She didn't answer me at all.

0:03:08.520,0:03:16.740
After that, I left because of the condition of my leg; I was left with a wound.

0:03:16.740,0:03:22.060
Because I didn't have better treatment, the
gunshot bullet was affecting my whole body.

0:03:22.060,0:03:25.220
I became weak and very sick.

0:03:25.220,0:03:28.580
I was looking so pale and I lost strength.

0:03:28.580,0:03:32.060
So I  went to stay with one of my friends.

0:03:32.060,0:03:36.960
While I was there, I was caught the second time.

0:03:36.960,0:03:41.320
They gave us an option that we should return to our country.

0:03:41.320,0:03:48.080
That even if we didn't make it over there, by returning to our country, we would be able to make it here.

0:03:48.080,0:03:53.760
So, I decided to return to my country to start all over.

0:03:53.760,0:03:57.980
That was how I was deported to Nigeria.

0:03:57.980,0:04:01.180
Can you show us where you had the gunshot wound?

0:04:01.180,0:04:06.880
I was shot here; the bullet passed here and came out from underneath my leg.

0:04:06.880,0:04:13.880
I was very sick when I came back because from my waist downward, I was affected.

0:04:13.880,0:04:16.480
I was very weak and losing strength.

0:04:16.480,0:04:19.920
When I came here, they assigned me to some doctors,

0:04:19.920,0:04:25.300
they gave me some medication that helped me to be able to sleep and eat well.

0:04:25.300,0:04:35.720
I was able to walk well, though I am still feeling pains but I am bearing the pain.

0:04:35.720,0:04:39.880
My advice to young people is that they should not try this thing,

0:04:39.880,0:04:42.740
this illegal journey because it is not good.

0:04:42.740,0:04:47.720
People might post different pictures on the internet that may make you think the place is good,

0:04:47.720,0:04:50.220
"Ah, they are making money there and they are doing well!"

0:04:50.220,0:04:51.900
The place is not good.

0:04:51.900,0:04:56.880
They don't treat us Nigerians well; they beat and treat people like us there like slaves.

0:04:56.880,0:05:00.300
My advice to parents, please take care of your children.

0:05:00.300,0:05:04.520
Don't give your children out to people who are doing human trafficking.

0:05:04.520,0:05:08.200
They may not tell you what they are 
taking your children to go and do over there.

0:05:08.200,0:05:13.520
They would just tell you that they want to take your child to go over there to do something.

0:05:13.520,0:05:16.640
At the end of the day, they would change the whole story for you.

0:05:16.640,0:05:20.520
So please, parents, be careful of such people.

0:05:20.520,0:05:24.580
Young girls of nowadays, it is not good to date at an early stage

0:05:24.580,0:05:31.760
because in my case, it was through the person I was dating that I got into all these things.

0:05:31.760,0:05:37.400
My name is Mary. I was among the thousands that were deported from Libya.

0:05:37.400,0:05:42.540
I went to Libya because things were not moving well for me.

0:05:42.540,0:05:48.560
I have no parents; nobody to take care of us and my younger siblings.

0:05:48.560,0:05:52.060
I was trying to give them a better future.

0:05:52.060,0:05:57.520
When I was learning hair dressing, I was explaining to my friend,

0:05:57.520,0:06:02.480
"Look at the situation we are in. There is nobody to help".

0:06:02.480,0:06:04.680
My friend advised me to travel.

0:06:04.680,0:06:08.620
That if I travelled, I would be able to take good care of my younger siblings.

0:06:08.620,0:06:14.560
That if I looked at my friends who have travelled, they have acquired cars and houses.

0:06:14.560,0:06:17.920
That if I went there, I would be able to take care of my family.

0:06:17.920,0:06:23.440
I decided to travel; there was nobody to advice me.

0:06:23.440,0:06:29.520
When I started on the journey, it was so tough and I could not come back.

0:06:29.520,0:06:33.380
The journey was 50/50 and I had to continue with the journey.

0:06:33.380,0:06:38.260
If I die, I die. Or I get saved. So I continued the journey.

0:06:38.260,0:06:43.940
I went to the desert - we trekked for 8 hours in the desert with no water or food.

0:06:43.940,0:06:49.600
We spent some days in the desert and then they brought us back.

0:06:49.600,0:06:54.480
They said that we must continue the journey because there was no more going back.

0:06:54.480,0:06:57.940
So many people were dying; children were dying.

0:06:57.940,0:07:07.360
They would dig the ground and bury people alive.

0:07:07.360,0:07:13.140
God helped me and I was able to pass that desert in the hot sun.

0:07:13.140,0:07:16.420
The sun is like fire on the head.

0:07:16.420,0:07:17.880
I got to Libya.

0:07:17.880,0:07:23.260
When I got there, the friend that deceived me in going there abandoned me.

0:07:23.260,0:07:26.520
He did not pay the money I used to go to Libya.

0:07:26.520,0:07:28.080
So they then sold me.

0:07:28.080,0:07:31.560
When they sold me, the man said that I had to do prostitution.

0:07:31.560,0:07:34.940
I told him I vowed in my life never to do prostitution.

0:07:34.940,0:07:37.620
It is not good and a sin against God.

0:07:37.629,0:07:40.540
He insisted I must do it and he beat me up.

0:07:40.540,0:07:43.300
He stripped me naked, and took my picture.

0:07:43.300,0:07:48.180
He cut my hair and finger nails, and 
took my bra and underwear.

0:07:48.180,0:07:51.520
He threatened to post it on the internet to show what I was doing.

0:07:51.520,0:07:53.780
I told him it is not good and I can't do it.

0:07:53.780,0:07:55.500
He said I must pay the money.

0:07:55.500,0:07:57.340
He beat me every day.

0:07:57.340,0:08:01.860
I had no choice; I cried every day doing prostitution.

0:08:01.860,0:08:07.780
In a day, about 10 men would sleep with me.

0:08:07.780,0:08:09.940
I would be crying.

0:08:09.940,0:08:12.340
Those that would be sleeping with me, when they saw me crying,

0:08:12.340,0:08:15.740
I would tell them that that job was not for me.

0:08:15.740,0:08:18.920
They would go to the man and tell him that they wanted to help me.

0:08:18.920,0:08:21.880
The man would refuse and insist that I must do that prostitution.

0:08:21.880,0:08:23.060
So I had no choice.

0:08:23.060,0:08:26.300
He would beat me and put a bottle inside my private part.

0:08:26.300,0:08:27.740
That I must do it.

0:08:27.740,0:08:30.680
Anytime I worked, he collected the money.

0:08:30.680,0:08:34.640
The police then came to the place, to come and bust that place.

0:08:34.640,0:08:36.600
They took me to prison.

0:08:36.600,0:08:39.940
I was in prison, with no food or water.

0:08:39.940,0:08:41.680
I just asked God to help me,

0:08:41.680,0:08:45.320
because I was always praying, telling God to see me through.

0:08:45.320,0:08:49.060
This work was not for me. Even if I was poor, but God should help me.

0:08:49.060,0:08:53.200
I was praying, "When will I came back to Nigeria? Nigeria is good".

0:08:53.200,0:08:55.200
Many Africans were dying.

0:08:55.200,0:08:58.720
The journey is not good; the road is very bad.

0:08:58.720,0:09:02.260
We were finally deported to Nigeria.

0:09:02.260,0:09:08.140
I came back to Nigeria with nothing.
All the work I did was in vain.

0:09:08.140,0:09:13.100
When we came here yesterday, the man of God took good care of us.

0:09:13.100,0:09:15.920
He took us to the hospital.

0:09:15.920,0:09:17.820
He listened to our stories.

0:09:17.820,0:09:22.020
So I decided that today, I must come to the church to testify.

0:09:22.020,0:09:23.860
I am very happy.

0:09:23.860,0:09:25.640
How old are you?

0:09:25.640,0:09:28.420
I am 27 years old.

0:09:28.420,0:09:32.140
How long did you spend over there?

0:09:32.140,0:09:37.620
I spent 2 years.

0:09:37.620,0:09:39.540
Okay, two years.

0:09:39.540,0:09:44.040
I would advice the young girls not to travel illegally;

0:09:44.040,0:09:48.320
they should not listen to anyone because they would come with sweet words,

0:09:48.320,0:09:50.940
telling you nice things about the journey.

0:09:50.940,0:09:56.660
It is not good to enter into a relationship at a young age.

0:09:56.660,0:10:02.280
I entered into a relationship at a young age because I had no helper.

0:10:02.280,0:10:08.160
I don't want my sisters to enter into a relationship at a young age.

0:10:08.160,0:10:11.360
I want them to live a better life.

0:10:11.360,0:10:15.720
I am here, thanking God for what He has done for me.

0:10:15.720,0:10:18.180
I thought I was never going to come back to Nigeria

0:10:18.180,0:10:24.820
because I wasn't allowed to make a call whilst I was in Libya.

0:10:24.820,0:10:27.200
My family never knew where I was.

0:10:27.200,0:10:30.520
But I thank God for bringing me here.

0:10:30.520,0:10:35.820
Okay, so you mean you actually regret going on this journey?

0:10:35.820,0:10:36.840
Yes.

0:10:36.840,0:10:42.620
And do you now value your country better than where you were traveling to?

0:10:42.620,0:10:44.440
Yes.

0:10:44.440,0:10:48.560
Okay. We have listened to the sister.

0:10:48.560,0:10:51.880
Can we listen to the next person?

0:10:51.880,0:10:56.600
I am Washington, I am a Liberian.

0:10:56.600,0:11:00.060
It was my friend who encouraged me to embark on this journey.

0:11:00.060,0:11:05.740
He told me that I am a mechanic and I can travel to work as a mechanic over there

0:11:05.740,0:11:09.700
because there is much money in it.

0:11:09.700,0:11:15.160
So I embarked on the journey. When I got  to Libya, they kidnapped me.

0:11:15.160,0:11:18.760
I called one of my friends in Liberia.

0:11:18.760,0:11:24.900
He sent me 1,700 US dollars to free me from the kidnappers.

0:11:24.900,0:11:30.760
Our brother says his name is Washington and he is originally from Liberia.

0:11:30.760,0:11:35.120
He is one of the deportees from Libya.

0:11:35.120,0:11:41.040
He was actually deceived by a friend to come over to Germany

0:11:41.040,0:11:44.640
through an illegal route, passing through Libya.

0:11:44.640,0:11:52.580
When he was traveling, he was arrested and faced a lot of torture in Libya.

0:11:52.580,0:11:55.960
In the prison, I was beaten every morning and evening.

0:11:55.960,0:11:59.120
When my friend paid the money, the kidnappers refused to free me.

0:11:59.120,0:12:01.680
I had one Nigerian friend in prison.

0:12:01.680,0:12:06.960
He said that when he got to Libya, he was kidnapped and put in prison.

0:12:06.960,0:12:14.520
In prison, he was calling his family to bail him out.

0:12:14.520,0:12:18.180
But he could not get in touch with his family to bail him out.

0:12:18.180,0:12:21.820
It was one of his friends that paid the money to bail him out.

0:12:21.820,0:12:26.460
Even after paying the money, they refused to release him from prison.

0:12:26.460,0:12:28.600
The Nigerian man I met there told me he got the key to the prison

0:12:28.600,0:12:31.475
and he could open the prison door so that everyone inside can escape.

0:12:31.480,0:12:34.840
He opened it and everyone climbed on the fence and jumped down unto the desert.

0:12:34.840,0:12:37.000
He opened it and everyone climbed on the fence and jumped down unto the desert.

0:12:37.000,0:12:43.800
We were in the desert for three days.

0:12:43.800,0:12:49.680
He said while they were in prison and many other people with him,

0:12:49.680,0:12:54.640
there was a Nigerian man who happened to get the keys to the prison.

0:12:54.640,0:12:57.940
the man opened the prison door and they all ran out.

0:12:57.940,0:13:03.060
He spent three days in the desert without food and water.

0:13:03.060,0:13:09.260
In the desert, we scattered; we were six per group.

0:13:09.260,0:13:15.100
As we were going, they kidnapped four persons; I and my brother escaped.

0:13:15.100,0:13:18.480
He said while they were escaping through the desert,

0:13:18.500,0:13:22.420
they divided themselves into groups of six people.

0:13:22.420,0:13:30.000
In his own group of six, four were captured and taken to the prison

0:13:30.000,0:13:33.040
while himself and one other person managed to escape.

0:13:33.040,0:13:39.400
When we escaped, we went to our big man's place.

0:13:39.400,0:13:41.740
We stayed indoors, we couldn't come outside.

0:13:41.740,0:13:43.120
We were in the house throughout.

0:13:43.120,0:13:47.500
That day, he told us he would send us to Italy.

0:13:47.500,0:13:49.620
That same day, they caught us again.

0:13:49.620,0:13:53.560
The police put me in prison; I was there for 8 months.

0:13:53.560,0:13:57.820
He said after that time, he managed to find his way to the sea,

0:13:57.820,0:14:01.560
trying to cross over the Mediterranean sea to Europe.

0:14:01.560,0:14:06.240
The day he was waiting to go on that journey on the sea,

0:14:06.240,0:14:09.780
himself and other people were captured and put in the prison.

0:14:09.780,0:14:13.540
They were arrested and he spent 8 months in prison.

0:14:13.540,0:14:16.460
I was seeing other people going to their country

0:14:16.460,0:14:20.320
but there was no flight from Libya to my country.

0:14:20.320,0:14:24.700
So, I decided to declare myself as Nigerian in order to come to Nigeria.

0:14:24.700,0:14:28.540
While in the prison, I heard about Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:14:28.540,0:14:33.220
So, I decided to come to The SCOAN for him to send me back to Liberia.

0:14:33.220,0:14:37.660
He said while he was in the prison, he started hearing about

0:14:37.660,0:14:40.760
the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and about the church

0:14:40.760,0:14:46.340
and how the man of God has been helping the deportees from Libya.

0:14:46.340,0:14:49.920
When they come back to the country, the man of God would help them,

0:14:49.920,0:14:53.800
trying to integrate them back into the society and establish them.

0:14:53.800,0:15:01.120
He said that the organisations that were deporting them to different countries came

0:15:01.120,0:15:04.620
and people from different countries were deported.

0:15:04.620,0:15:07.800
But for him, there were no flight going to his country

0:15:07.800,0:15:10.440
because he was the only Liberian in the prison.

0:15:10.440,0:15:15.440
So what he had to do was to lie that he was a Nigerian

0:15:15.440,0:15:17.560
so that he could come with the Nigerian people.

0:15:17.560,0:15:20.420
That is why he is in Nigeria today.

0:15:20.420,0:15:25.300
Mr Washington
Libya Deportee Shares Experience

0:15:25.300,0:15:28.280
So he said because of what he has been hearing

0:15:28.280,0:15:30.440
how the man of God has been helping people,

0:15:30.440,0:15:33.520
he believed that if he came to Nigeria,

0:15:33.520,0:15:40.420
God would use the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to help him get back to Liberia.

0:15:40.420,0:15:48.600
While in the prison, my Nigerian friend told me that if I was not careful, I would fail the interview.

0:15:48.600,0:15:50.200
He decided to teach me.

0:15:50.200,0:15:54.720
When they asked me where I came from, I should tell them that I was from Kaduna State.

0:15:54.720,0:15:58.460
When they asked me about the local government, I should tell them it was Sanga.

0:15:58.460,0:16:01.860
He wrote it on a piece of paper and I practised it.

0:16:01.860,0:16:06.960
When I sat for the first test, I failed in the first test; I was the third person.

0:16:06.960,0:16:09.940
They now gave me number 50; I went all the way back.

0:16:09.940,0:16:12.200
I started crying because if I failed the tests,

0:16:12.200,0:16:14.800
if I didn't go back to my country, I would surely die in that prison.

0:16:14.800,0:16:18.260
because I was the only Liberian in that prison; there was no flight to Liberia.

0:16:18.260,0:16:21.820
Even in Libya, I couldn't call Liberia because the call wouldn't go through.

0:16:21.820,0:16:24.340
If I wanted to call my mum, I would call through Guinea

0:16:24.340,0:16:27.920
and tell the person to call my mum. My mum would then call me.

0:16:27.920,0:16:29.760
That's how I used to communicate with my mum.

0:16:29.760,0:16:36.100
He said while in the prison, it was even difficult to call his family in Liberia.

0:16:36.100,0:16:40.060
While others were interviewed, documentations were done

0:16:40.060,0:16:44.860
and they were deported to their country, he faced a lot of challenges.

0:16:44.860,0:16:49.120
He was not a Nigerian and so when he went for the interview,

0:16:49.120,0:16:50.920
he was not able to say the right thing.

0:16:50.920,0:16:55.460
But there was a Nigerian brother that was teaching him what to say -

0:16:55.460,0:16:58.580
from this State and local government - but each time he would fail.

0:16:58.580,0:17:00.780
So they were taking him back into the prison again

0:17:00.780,0:17:04.640
where he would start crying and begging them so they gave him another chance.

0:17:04.640,0:17:10.260
Then he was able to scale through the interview and got the documents to come to Nigeria.

0:17:10.260,0:17:13.120
How long did you spend over there in Libya?

0:17:13.120,0:17:15.160
I spent eight months in prison.

0:17:15.160,0:17:19.260
The whole time I was in Libya, I was in prison throughout; I never came out.

0:17:19.260,0:17:23.000
And you couldn't get to your destination, Europe?

0:17:23.000,0:17:24.400
Yes, I couldn't get to my destination.

0:17:24.400,0:17:27.760
So what advice do you have for people who are listening to you now?

0:17:27.760,0:17:32.660
Youngsters all over the place, in every country, what advice do you have for them?

0:17:32.660,0:17:35.720
The advice I have for my friends all over the world is

0:17:35.720,0:17:40.240
that you should never use this route to go anywhere.

0:17:40.240,0:17:44.120
Don't let anyone fool you on Facebook that so and so thing is going on,

0:17:44.120,0:17:45.980
I want you to come to so and so place.

0:17:45.980,0:17:50.880
If you don't have the money to fly to a country, don't use the desert road to go anywhere;

0:17:50.880,0:17:53.060
don't use the sea route to go anywhere.

0:17:53.060,0:17:58.720
Okay, so our brother is advising everyone, especially the youth,

0:17:58.720,0:18:04.300
that if you want to travel, travel through the right channel, through legal means.

0:18:04.300,0:18:09.000
Don't go by an illegal route, don't allow anyone to lure or deceive you

0:18:09.000,0:18:11.560
that everything would be fine.

0:18:11.560,0:18:15.160
He is coming from there and nothing is actually fine.

0:18:15.160,0:18:19.800
It is a regrettable journey; he doesn't want anyone to experience what he has experienced.

0:18:19.800,0:18:25.280
So what do you want now? You are now in Nigeria, what exactly do you want?

0:18:25.280,0:18:35.420
I even came without clothing and the man of God gave me clothes, food and shelter.

0:18:35.420,0:18:39.240
Okay. You heard from the brother. He said he came with nothing

0:18:39.240,0:18:47.360
and the man of God gave him money to get clothes, send him for medical treatment,

0:18:47.360,0:18:51.300
before he now came to share this experience today.

0:18:51.300,0:18:53.380
So, what do you want now?

0:18:53.380,0:18:58.360
I want to tell the man of God to please help me and send me back to my country.

0:18:58.360,0:19:01.600
That is all that I want from him, I want to go back to my country.

0:19:01.600,0:19:03.100
I miss my people so much.

0:19:03.100,0:19:04.860
So you are begging to go back to your country now?

0:19:04.860,0:19:10.040
I want to go back, I really want to go back.

0:19:10.040,0:19:17.220
Okay, that is a lesson for everyone that no matter how bad your country is,

0:19:17.220,0:19:22.300
the situation of your county is, home is home and there is no place like home.

0:19:22.300,0:19:25.060
He has gone on the journey, just like others.

0:19:25.060,0:19:28.580
They have experienced the other side of other countries.

0:19:28.580,0:19:34.940
Now, they begged to come back to their country and are appreciating their country better.

0:19:34.940,0:19:39.720
For God Almighty to bring you back safely, we believe He has a plan for your life.

0:19:39.720,0:19:44.820
All the experiences you have passed
 through is to help you for your future. Amen!

0:19:44.820,0:19:45.660
Amen!

0:19:45.660,0:19:47.680
Thank you very much.

0:19:47.680,0:19:50.380
My name is Danazumi.

0:19:50.380,0:19:55.920
I am one of the thousand immigrants that were deported from Libya.

0:19:55.920,0:20:01.300
On going to Libya, there were about 50 cars carrying us through the desert.

0:20:01.300,0:20:06.500
On the way, many people died and some fainted.

0:20:06.500,0:20:11.800
There was no food and water in the desert - for many days, about one month.

0:20:11.800,0:20:20.120
Some people spent one month, some several weeks and some about seven days in the desert.

0:20:20.120,0:20:28.860
In Libya, we were arrested by some men who used us to look for money.

0:20:28.860,0:20:33.120
They asked us to call our parents to pay some ransom.

0:20:33.120,0:20:36.340
We called our parents with their phone.

0:20:36.340,0:20:42.500
I called my parents and told them that I was kidnapped by some men

0:20:42.500,0:20:45.040
and they asked me to pay the sum of 700,000 Naira.

0:20:45.040,0:20:48.880
My mum shouted, "Where do you expect me to get that amount of money from?

0:20:48.880,0:20:50.800
Did you tell me that you were travelling?"

0:20:50.800,0:20:52.660
I said, "That is not the question now.

0:20:52.660,0:20:55.360
The question is: How am I going to leave from here?"

0:20:55.360,0:21:02.740
She then told me, "I have nothing to do. I will not kill myself because of you".

0:21:02.740,0:21:08.800
She was angry, so, I began to plead with her, "I beg, please help me in this situation".

0:21:08.800,0:21:11.220
She thought that I was lying.

0:21:11.220,0:21:16.360
The day when she saw me that I was being hanged, 
which is called 'monkey hanging' -

0:21:16.360,0:21:20.440
they called her through video call, they were videoing me, beating me -

0:21:20.440,0:21:24.280
she began to cry on the phone, saying, "What is she going to do?"

0:21:24.280,0:21:27.640
I told her to run around and maybe sell the plot of land,

0:21:27.640,0:21:30.900
or to do any other thing to raise the money to help me out.

0:21:30.900,0:21:33.940
She did whatever she could and helped me out of there.

0:21:33.940,0:21:40.360
When I got out, I looked for where to hustle to get money to feed

0:21:40.360,0:21:42.720
because I didn't want to call my mother again for money.

0:21:42.720,0:21:49.480
I started working with a man who carried me to work every day and also gave me food.

0:21:49.480,0:21:51.800
He said he would pay me after seven days.

0:21:51.800,0:21:53.820
When the seventh day reached, I went to meet him,

0:21:53.820,0:21:57.380
"I beg, I want to collect the money you said you will pay me".

0:21:57.380,0:22:01.740
He said, "Which money?"

0:22:01.740,0:22:06.800
I thought to myself that if we were in Nigeria, this man would give me the money by force.

0:22:06.800,0:22:09.460
I tried to force him to give me the money.

0:22:09.460,0:22:11.680
The man asked me to wait for him.

0:22:11.680,0:22:13.960
I thought he was going to bring the money.

0:22:13.960,0:22:18.320
He went inside and came out with an AK-47 in his hand.

0:22:18.320,0:22:21.200
I thought to myself that if I ran, he would shoot me,

0:22:21.200,0:22:24.780
so it would be better to wait for him to beat me up.

0:22:24.780,0:22:28.420
The man used the gun and flogged me continuously.

0:22:28.420,0:22:31.020
I was thanking God that the man did not shoot me.

0:22:31.020,0:22:38.980
He beat me to the extent of breaking a bone on my hand.

0:22:38.980,0:22:42.260
He then allowed me and I left that place.

0:22:42.260,0:22:47.000
I went to my friend's place to ask them to help me.

0:22:47.000,0:22:52.740
We have listened to the brother; many of us could not actually understand him.

0:22:52.740,0:22:57.260
He was speaking in pidgin English to express himself very well.

0:22:57.260,0:23:01.040
He said he was one of the people that travelled to Libya through an illegal route.

0:23:01.040,0:23:05.740
Before he left, he never told his mother or any member of his family

0:23:05.740,0:23:10.180
until when he got there, he was kidnapped, put in the cell

0:23:10.180,0:23:15.720
and was asked to pay a ransom of 700,000 Naira.

0:23:15.720,0:23:21.540
He contacted his mother and told her that kidnappers were demanding 700,000 Naira.

0:23:21.540,0:23:30.220
The mother could not afford it and she had sell a plot of land and other things to raise the money.

0:23:30.220,0:23:37.200
After he was released from the prison, he went out and got someone who offered him a job.

0:23:37.200,0:23:39.980
He would be paying him after every seven days.

0:23:39.980,0:23:45.560
After working for seven days, he went to the man and demanded his money.

0:23:45.560,0:23:49.380
The man asked him, "What money? Which money are you talking about?"

0:23:49.380,0:23:52.620
He told the man, "But our agreement was that you would pay me after seven days".

0:23:52.620,0:23:53.920
The man told him, "Ok, wait for me".

0:23:53.920,0:23:58.220
He said that he was trying to be stubborn to the man; he thought he was in his country.

0:23:58.220,0:24:01.320
But before he knew, it was too late.

0:24:01.320,0:24:05.320
When the man went in, he thought the man was going to bring the money to pay him.

0:24:05.320,0:24:08.040
Rather, the man brought out an AK-47 rifle.

0:24:08.040,0:24:12.180
He couldn't run because he believed that the man was going to shoot him.

0:24:12.180,0:24:16.300
So he waited and the man used the AK-47 to hit him.

0:24:16.300,0:24:20.380
That was how he sustained this broken arm.

0:24:20.380,0:24:23.840
I went home to meet my friends and told them

0:24:23.840,0:24:26.420
that I want to go to the hospital to get treatment.

0:24:26.420,0:24:29.240
My friend asked me, "Do you know where you are?

0:24:29.240,0:24:33.460
Do you have anything to go to the hospital with?

0:24:33.460,0:24:35.940
You cannot go to the hospital in this country.

0:24:35.940,0:24:38.920
We will help you to tie the hand; you will carry it like that".

0:24:38.920,0:24:41.980
That is how they tied the hand and I was in that condition for almost seven months.

0:24:41.980,0:24:47.020
I was going up and down with this hand, looking for a way to go back to my country

0:24:47.020,0:24:49.880
or go further to get treatment for the hand.

0:24:49.880,0:24:53.780
There was no solution until I was arrested.

0:24:53.780,0:24:58.480
Okay, can you tell us what advice you have for people who are listening to you now?

0:24:58.480,0:25:01.460
Remember, you left your country hale and hearty

0:25:01.460,0:25:07.280
and now you are back with a broken arm and a terrible experience over there.

0:25:07.280,0:25:12.240
What advice do you have for people, especially the youth?

0:25:12.240,0:25:15.740
My advice to everyone watching me now is that

0:25:15.740,0:25:19.000
you can see that I have come back with a broken arm

0:25:19.000,0:25:22.320
with nothing - all the money was being wasted.

0:25:22.320,0:25:30.380
They should be careful with the kind of friends they mingle with.

0:25:30.380,0:25:35.240
Parents should take good care of their children

0:25:35.240,0:25:39.440
and find out what they are doing - whether it is right or wrong.

0:25:39.440,0:25:47.600
They should be careful of the lies people tell them about this journey,

0:25:47.600,0:25:50.200
"In two or three days, you are going to be there".

0:25:50.200,0:25:53.100
They are telling you lies, just to collect money.

0:25:53.100,0:25:57.060
No one should embark on this journey because it is very deadly.

0:25:57.060,0:26:00.140
Many people die on the sea and on the land.

0:26:00.140,0:26:04.360
I want to advise them to always stay in their country to hustle.

0:26:04.360,0:26:06.740
I believe that one day God will make a way

0:26:06.740,0:26:11.000
and God will bless them and they will become something in life.

0:26:11.000,0:26:14.320
Our brothers and sisters who have come today to share their experiences,

0:26:14.320,0:26:22.740
as we can see, they are in helpless need of assistance to be able to start life again.

0:26:22.740,0:26:27.880
In view of this, the anointed man of God says help is the best investment.

0:26:27.880,0:26:31.840
We should make a tangible contribution to the life of others.

0:26:31.840,0:26:35.040
With the support of the Emmanuel TV partners,

0:26:35.040,0:26:39.160
the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has asked us to give

0:26:39.160,0:26:44.320
the sum of 200,000 Naira to each of our brothers and sisters here.

0:26:44.320,0:26:51.780
Libya Deportees Each Receive 200,000 Naira
From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners

0:26:51.780,0:26:56.340
That is the sum of 200,000 Naira cash each,

0:26:56.340,0:27:01.700
and 'The Mirror' book offered by the anointed man of God for the salvation of your soul.

0:27:01.700,0:27:06.860
Remember that whatever the man of God does is for the salvation of souls

0:27:06.860,0:27:11.480
so that they can go back and make something meaningful with their lives.

They can get into a business, trade, and be able to get back on their feet again

0:27:16.660,0:27:21.280
and never think of going through this kind of journey again.

0:29:39.100,0:29:42.480
all you need to do is to make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:29:42.480,0:29:48.700
Anywhere you go, please take time out to advise people not to go on this illegal journey.

0:29:48.700,0:29:52.800
If anyone wants to travel outside the country for a good purpose,

0:29:52.800,0:29:55.960
they should wait for God's time and go through the right channel.

0:29:55.960,0:29:59.140
We pray that God Almighty will give you the grace

0:29:59.140,0:30:02.320
to make the best use of the resources you have received,

0:30:02.320,0:30:06.660
and God Almighty who has provided this will continue the supply, in Jesus' name!

0:30:06.660,0:30:07.580
Amen!

0:30:07.580,0:30:15.340
After listening to their complaints in regards to their health, the Libya Deportees received prayer

0:30:15.340,0:30:21.060
in the power of the Holy Spirit for healing and deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:30:21.060,0:30:23.040
Let's watch.

0:30:23.040,0:30:24.540
Man of God, please, help me.

0:30:24.540,0:30:27.520

My name is Akeem. I am one of the thousands that were deported.

0:32:28.520,0:32:31.320
I came back with a broken hand.

0:32:31.320,0:32:34.180
But since the man of God prayed for me, I received my healing.

0:32:34.180,0:32:38.680
Now I can move my hand and use it to eat.

0:32:38.680,0:32:43.980
Thank You, Jesus. I am free.

After listening to Mr Washington's situation, Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners

0:32:52.020,0:32:56.920
helped him with all the necessary documents to travel back to his country, Liberia,

0:32:56.920,0:33:04.620
including the flight ticket and also the sum of $1,000 USD so that he can start his life afresh in Liberia.

Let's watch.

STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:33:11.900,0:33:17.700
My name is Washington, I'm a Liberian.

0:33:17.700,0:33:21.480
I am one of the deportees from Libya.

0:33:21.480,0:33:24.020
There was no flight from Libya to my country,

0:33:24.020,0:33:28.100
so I decided to lie to the people that I am from Nigeria.

0:33:28.100,0:33:30.140
That's why they brought me to Nigeria.

0:33:30.140,0:33:33.660
I'm appealing to the man of God to send me back to my country.

0:33:33.660,0:33:35.600
I came without any documents.

0:33:35.600,0:33:39.300
I don't have a passport, identity card or identity document.

0:33:39.300,0:33:42.760
I'm appealing to the man of God to help me, to send me back to my country.

0:33:42.760,0:33:46.240
I can't stay in Nigeria because I am not from Nigeria.

0:33:46.240,0:33:49.240
We have heard from the young man.

0:33:49.240,0:33:53.920
He's a Liberian and he finds himself in Nigeria because he had to be deported

0:33:53.920,0:34:00.480
with other Nigerian Libyan deportees because he couldn't go back to his country, Liberia.

0:34:00.480,0:34:07.560
Now, he is stranded in Nigeria because he has no money to transport himself back to Liberia

0:34:07.560,0:34:11.080
and he doesn't have any travelling document - no passport, nothing.

0:34:11.080,0:34:13.420
He didn't even have clothes when he came.

0:34:13.420,0:34:19.480
It was the man of God that provided clothing, feeding and accommodation for him

0:34:19.480,0:34:23.820
ever since last week when they were deported from Libya.

0:34:23.820,0:34:29.160
We can see you holding a document. 
What document is this?

0:34:29.160,0:34:37.040
This is the document they used to deport me from Libya to Nigeria.

0:34:37.040,0:34:42.860
This is the document that Mr Washington received after claiming that he was a Nigerian,

0:34:42.860,0:34:47.500
so that they would deport him out of Libya.

0:34:47.500,0:34:56.720
The anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua is aware of your case

0:34:56.720,0:35:00.820
and he has also responded promptly.

0:35:00.820,0:35:07.240
He has made all the necessary travelling documents available for you

0:35:07.240,0:35:10.120
to be able to travel back to your country, Liberia.

0:35:10.120,0:35:15.520
These include the police report, affidavit, travelling documents

0:35:15.520,0:35:22.240
and your flight ticket to go back to Liberia.

0:35:22.240,0:35:31.880
These are all the documents and all the expenses have been paid by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:35:31.880,0:35:44.260
Here is your main travelling document which replaces your passport.

0:35:44.260,0:35:49.900
With this you can travel back to your country, Liberia.

0:35:49.900,0:35:58.340
This is your flight ticket back to Liberia.

0:35:58.340,0:36:03.700
This is the affidavit.

0:36:03.700,0:36:15.720
Lastly, we have the Nigerian police report.

0:36:15.720,0:36:17.440
To God be the glory.

0:36:17.440,0:36:22.940
Mr Washington has received all the necessary documents as well as the flight ticket

0:36:22.940,0:36:27.720
that would enable him to travel legally and freely back to Liberia.

0:36:27.720,0:36:35.140
In addition to the travel documents that have been procured by Prophet T.B. Joshua - all expenses paid -

0:36:35.140,0:36:39.100
the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, with the support of the Emmanuel TV Partners

0:36:39.100,0:36:44.760
has also decided to bless you with a cash gift so that when you get back to your country, Liberia

0:36:44.760,0:36:51.120
you would not have to start going around on the street or engaging yourself in any activities

0:36:51.120,0:36:53.980
that would not make you useful to the society.

0:36:53.980,0:37:03.240
The man of God has therefore asked us to give you this sum of $1000 USD.

0:37:03.240,0:37:08.340
Thank you so much.

0:37:08.340,0:37:12.160
Thank you so much, Man of God. May God bless you.

0:37:12.160,0:37:14.700
I am so happy for that. Thank you so much.

0:37:14.700,0:37:17.180
God bless you. God bless the ministry.

0:37:17.180,0:37:20.960
God bless everyone, God bless all the members of the church.

0:37:20.960,0:37:22.840
Thank you so much, Man of God.
