0:00:00.000,0:00:04.380
A gentleman over there – you have two wives.

0:00:04.380,0:00:09.700
You don’t know how you came about these two wives; they live separately.

0:00:09.700,0:00:14.040
You will not be able to continue this life – it is too tough, too difficult for you.

0:00:14.040,0:00:15.780
You scraped your hair.

0:00:15.780,0:00:20.980
He is a young man with a t-shirt with some pictures on it.

0:00:20.980,0:00:23.880
Yes.

0:00:23.880,0:00:31.020
You will not be able to cope; you just need God’s intervention to save you.

0:00:31.020,0:00:37.100
You will not be able to cope this time because people may see you as very hilarious;

0:00:37.100,0:00:40.520
he is a gentleman; it is just appearance.

0:00:40.520,0:00:46.480
My name is Gabriel.
I come from the Republic of Benin.

0:00:46.480,0:00:55.460
Don't mind my English because I'm not from Nigeria.

0:00:55.460,0:00:59.360
This is my lovely wife.

0:00:59.360,0:01:04.800
This is my first daughter.

0:01:04.800,0:01:09.760
This is my lovely second daughter.

0:01:09.760,0:01:21.100
I came here last week for the first time and the man of God prophesied that someone had two wives

0:01:21.100,0:01:25.760
and they were not in the same country; they were in different countries.

0:01:25.760,0:01:33.520
When the man of God said this, my conscience told me that I wasn’t here for this so don’t rise up.

0:01:33.520,0:01:35.640
Then, I kept sitting.

0:01:35.640,0:01:41.800
But when he repeated it the second time, I don’t know what pushed me to the front.

0:01:41.800,0:01:45.580
Then I said, “Yes, Man of God, the prophecy is mine”.

0:01:45.580,0:01:50.460
I am a marine man; I used to work in Lagos.

0:01:50.460,0:01:57.120
I supply vessels.

0:01:57.120,0:02:02.160
For over three years, my business is not moving.

0:02:02.160,0:02:06.800
I used to travel to Ghana and Lome, Togo for my work.

0:02:06.800,0:02:13.200
Anywhere I went, women used to love me.

0:02:13.200,0:02:19.900
Even if I met them for the first time, they used to fall in love with me.

0:02:19.900,0:02:22.600
My business was not moving at all.

0:02:22.600,0:02:31.740
I went to many places for solution but there was no way.

0:02:31.740,0:02:40.860
One of my friends introduced me to The SCOAN last week, I came and the man of God prophesied to me.

0:02:40.860,0:02:48.280
With the work I used to do in Nigeria, I used to stay four to five months before going back to Benin.

0:02:48.280,0:02:52.620
So, my family and my wife used to miss me because when I came to Lagos,

0:02:52.620,0:02:58.180
I used to have many women so, I wouldn’t bother about my family.

0:02:58.180,0:03:01.960
She would be calling me and I would tell her not to worry, that I had come to make money and

0:03:01.960,0:03:04.200
when I had money, I would come home.

0:03:04.200,0:03:07.100
I could stay for five months but no money.

0:03:07.100,0:03:09.760
I would go back home and she would feed me.

0:03:09.760,0:03:12.180
I tried my best; I went to Ghana.

0:03:12.180,0:03:16.860
If the white men came, they would call me at Ghana or Lome.

0:03:16.860,0:03:22.560
If I went there, I would do the work, the money would come but I wouldn't know how the money went.

0:03:22.560,0:03:25.240
I didn’t usually come home with anything.

0:03:25.240,0:03:30.900
When I came for my first time, last week, the man of God prophesied to me.

0:03:30.900,0:03:35.820
I said, "Yes, truly; but this was too much".

0:03:35.820,0:03:39.160
I thought to myself that I should get another wife.

0:03:39.160,0:03:48.300
I went out in Lagos, found another lady and got married to her, which my wife doesn’t know about.

0:03:48.300,0:03:55.940
What the man of God said is true.

0:03:55.940,0:04:03.160
I didn’t expect that in my life this secret could leak out because my wife is in Benin,

0:04:03.160,0:04:06.360
while the other woman is staying in Lagos.

0:04:06.360,0:04:20.340
I brought my wife here once but when I got the second wife, I didn’t bring her anymore.

0:04:20.340,0:04:24.960
You mean that today is the first time your wife is hearing of this?

0:04:24.960,0:04:26.860
It is the first time that my wife is hearing this.

0:04:26.860,0:04:33.700
Even the lady that I am talking about now, the man of God said I should invite her and she is here now.

0:04:33.700,0:04:35.000
My wife does not know her.

0:04:35.000,0:04:41.400
Please, I want the man of God to help me settle my family.

0:04:41.400,0:04:44.380
This has destroyed my business.

0:04:44.380,0:04:50.580
When I came here, what the man of God said means that through this, my business is not moving.

0:04:50.580,0:04:54.020
My wife and children are not happy with me.

0:04:54.020,0:04:57.260
That is why my business has a breakage.

0:04:57.260,0:05:00.620
Please, Man of God, help me and reconcile my family for me.

0:05:00.620,0:05:05.160
My name is Florence.
I am from Benin.

0:05:05.160,0:05:12.700
It is because of the prophecy that I got to know that my husband is having a woman outside.

0:05:12.700,0:05:22.060
When he used to tell me that he is going to work, I never thought that he was doing a different thing.

0:05:22.060,0:05:27.520
When he leaves the house, he can stay outside for three months

0:05:27.520,0:05:30.860
and when he comes back, he is never really happy.

0:05:30.860,0:05:35.480
Just for a little thing, he can get annoyed and begin to shout at me.

0:05:35.480,0:05:41.600
So, I am asking the man of God to save my marriage because presently, I am living in

0:05:41.600,0:05:48.100
my parents' house because of the financial problem we have.

0:05:48.100,0:05:50.840
I stay at the house of my parents.

0:05:50.840,0:05:56.000
So, I am asking the man of God to save me and to save my marriage.

0:05:56.000,0:06:02.180
After accommodating Mr Gabriel & his family in The SCOAN, the following Sunday,

0:06:02.180,0:06:07.420
Prophet T.B. Joshua counsels the family and also Mr Gabriel’s second wife,

0:06:07.420,0:06:13.660
telling them the mind of God about their future and praying for them in Jesus' name.

0:06:13.660,0:06:17.080
I also got married to this lady in Lagos.

0:06:17.080,0:06:20.800
You got married?

0:06:20.800,0:06:22.280
How many months now?

0:06:22.280,0:06:27.440
In August, it will be two years.

0:06:27.440,0:06:28.240
Give me your hand.

0:06:28.240,0:06:30.320
And my sister hearing it...

0:06:30.320,0:06:39.660
For her to even follow you here, she just wants to channel her own course and her own direction;

0:06:39.660,0:06:45.640
she is not interested and sees it as a past tense event.

0:06:45.640,0:06:47.600
Mistakes are correctable.

0:06:47.600,0:06:50.560
When we learn from our mistakes, we move on.

0:06:50.560,0:06:54.500
I want to say to my sister, I am your brother; I am at your service.

0:06:54.500,0:06:57.800
We shall meet after the prayer.

0:06:57.800,0:07:00.500
We can ask God the direction.

0:07:00.500,0:07:02.500
OK?

0:07:02.500,0:07:06.540
This is a family already that God has brought together.

0:07:06.540,0:07:12.820
It is just satan who came to try and separate this family; we thank God it is over today.

0:07:12.820,0:07:13.900
Thank you very much.

0:07:13.900,0:07:16.660
OK?

0:07:16.660,0:07:22.600
Since you have not talked of having a child between you and her, nothing like that?

0:07:22.600,0:07:23.300
No.

0:07:23.300,0:07:24.680
OK

0:07:24.680,0:07:26.720
Glory be to God.

0:07:26.720,0:07:29.660
Thank you very much.

0:07:29.660,0:07:35.920
It is not an issue you should raise at home; rather, put it behind you.

0:07:35.920,0:07:41.780
If you raise this issue anytime there is trouble, you begin to make jest of your husband

0:07:41.780,0:07:48.320
or remind him of his past, you also may be tempted because the Bible says

0:07:48.320,0:07:56.520
when one is caught out of sin or wrong, you who caught such a person should restore them gently

0:07:56.520,0:07:58.340
so that you will not be tempted.

0:07:58.340,0:08:00.140
OK?
Thank you.

0:08:00.140,0:08:18.340
Prophet T.B. Joshua Counsels Mr Gabriel & His Wife After The Sunday Service

0:08:18.340,0:08:19.980
Thank you, Man of God, I understand.

0:08:19.980,0:08:21.260
Thank you very much.

0:08:21.260,0:08:24.240
The right knowledge of God settles peace.

0:08:24.240,0:08:31.340
After the counselling, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mr Gabriel and his family in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:08:31.340,0:08:36.080
TESTIMONY TIME

0:08:36.080,0:08:41.780
My name is Gabriel.
I am from the Republic of Benin.

0:08:41.780,0:08:46.640
I am 38 years old.

0:08:46.640,0:08:49.220
The lady beside me is my lovely wife.

0:08:49.220,0:08:54.380
Her name is Florence.

0:08:54.380,0:08:55.640
You are both welcome, sir.

0:08:55.640,0:09:01.240
Can you just tell us what God Almighty has done for you since coming to The SCOAN?

0:09:01.240,0:09:06.680
Two weeks ago, I came to the service and the man of God prophesied that

0:09:06.680,0:09:10.640
there was somebody who had two wives who were not staying in the same country,

0:09:10.640,0:09:12.740
which was my prophesy.

0:09:12.740,0:09:26.920
Then, I rose up very surprised because he said the story of my life and I said, I was the one.

0:09:26.920,0:09:35.100
The man of God invited me to come with those two women to settle our lives.

0:09:35.100,0:09:37.420
Then, I brought them here.

0:09:37.420,0:09:41.040
That was when the man of God told me that because I had been cheating on my wife,

0:09:41.040,0:09:48.540
that things had turned upside down for me because I was not straight forward with her.

0:09:48.540,0:09:58.900
When I was working, all my things were upside down, my business collapsed, nothing went on.

0:09:58.900,0:10:05.680
I believe that any time from today when I apologise to God and her

0:10:05.680,0:10:08.980
that things will get better in the name of Jesus.

0:10:08.980,0:10:16.220
What he advised me to do was to stop looking outside and face my wife and family.

0:10:16.220,0:10:17.820
Then, my life will change.

0:10:17.820,0:10:22.480
I believe that and I apologise to my wife, that the past should be the past,

0:10:22.480,0:10:27.200
let us take steps towards what we are about to start genuinely.

0:10:27.200,0:10:28.880
So, I thank God.

0:10:28.880,0:10:29.880
Glory be to God.

0:10:29.880,0:10:36.880
Prophet T.B. Joshua counselled you that after the prophecy you should stay faithful to your wife

0:10:36.880,0:10:42.120
and that you should disconnect from the relationship with the other lady outside.

0:10:42.120,0:10:45.580
You are saying that right now you are actually asking for forgiveness from your wife

0:10:45.580,0:10:52.380
and you are promising that you are not gonna betray her again, that you gonna be faithful and stay with her.

0:10:52.380,0:10:55.920
Yes, truly – backwards never.

0:10:55.920,0:11:00.880
I am straight forward now with my wife and I promise her that all this is in the past.

0:11:00.880,0:11:02.880
The past cannot come to the present again.

0:11:02.880,0:11:06.080
I promise her one hundred percent of my new life.

0:11:06.080,0:11:12.980
My heart used to be heavy but now, I am light.

0:11:12.980,0:11:18.240
There are a lot of changes in my life and I thank God for all this.

0:11:18.240,0:11:22.760
We thank God for our brother's life and for the reconciliation that has taken place in his marriage

0:11:22.760,0:11:26.500
through that prophetic word and the counsel from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:11:26.500,0:11:47.340
There are a lot of changes in my life and I thank God for all this.

0:11:47.340,0:11:50.880
Thank You, Jesus.

0:11:50.880,0:11:59.400
My name is Florence.
I am from Benin.

0:11:59.400,0:12:01.540
Who is the man beside you?

0:12:01.540,0:12:05.740
It is my husband.

0:12:05.740,0:12:21.720
When I came to the church, I heard the prophecy given to my husband and I thank God for it.

0:12:21.720,0:12:37.680
I forgive him for all he has done and I ask God to give us a long life together.

0:12:37.680,0:12:45.260
I want to advise other women to take heart; no matter what happens in your home, have faith.

0:12:45.260,0:12:54.840
There is a God who is above all and takes care of all; just be patient and courageous.

0:12:54.840,0:13:10.840
Prophecy Testimony

0:13:10.840,0:13:14.440
We thank God for this wonderful word of advice and we salute our sister here

0:13:14.440,0:13:18.580
for really choosing to stay in the marriage despite everything that happened.

0:13:18.580,0:13:20.220
Hallelujah. We thank God once again.

0:13:20.220,0:13:23.400
We are here right now with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:13:23.400,0:13:28.860
Prophet T.B. Joshua said that now, as you have started this new chapter in your marriage, a new life in Christ

0:13:28.860,0:13:32.260
after this reconciliation, that he wants to support this family.

0:13:32.260,0:13:35.120
On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,

0:13:35.120,0:13:43.680
we are presenting you with this gift of 100, 000 naira.

0:13:43.680,0:13:49.480
This is to encourage this family to stay close to Jesus Christ and make the word of God

0:13:49.480,0:13:53.700
the standard for their lives and use this to start a fresh chapter in their lives,

0:13:53.700,0:13:57.640
now that the reconciliation has come, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:13:57.640,0:14:00.240
Amen.

0:14:00.240,0:14:04.660
I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners for all they have done.

0:14:04.660,0:14:13.900
May God be with them and bless them more.

0:14:13.900,0:14:18.500
Thank You, Jesus!

0:14:18.500,0:14:23.740
Mr. Gabriel And His Wife Receive 100,000 Naira From Prophet T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
