If your marriage is having challenges, don't give up! Ask God.

0:00:04.500,0:00:09.080
Don't let challenges quit you; let God.

0:00:09.080,0:00:12.700
Your business - don't let challenges quit you.

0:00:12.700,0:00:15.660
Your marriage - challenges should not quit you.

0:00:15.660,0:00:18.380
Your relationships - challenges should not quit you.

0:00:18.380,0:00:22.420
If you allow challenges to quit you. you are destroyed.

0:00:22.420,0:00:27.380
You are running from strength. You are running from grace, more grace.

0:00:27.380,0:00:35.160
Don't let challenges quit you but God. God should say leave, not challenges.

0:00:35.160,0:00:37.880
You abandon your marriage because of challenges.

0:00:37.880,0:00:40.660
You abandon your business partner because of challenges.

0:00:40.660,0:00:44.100
Don't let challenges quit you, but God.

0:00:44.100,0:00:50.460
Challenges are a grace to strengthen, help and equip you more.

0:00:50.460,0:00:54.620
When you are in the midst of challenges, ask God whether to quit or not -

0:00:54.620,0:00:56.560
not for that challenge to quit you.

0:00:56.560,0:01:01.860
No matter what they say about your wife or husband. Don't let it quit your marriage.

0:01:01.860,0:01:05.580
You quit your village because of witches and wizards.

0:01:05.580,0:01:10.740
Many of you that are here now - you abandoned your village because of witches and wizards.

0:01:10.740,0:01:14.120
You left your husband. You divorced because of challenges.

0:01:14.120,0:01:17.080
Everywhere are challenges.

0:01:17.080,0:01:21.660
You should see challenges as a blessing, not enemy.

0:01:21.660,0:01:27.940
See challenges as a blessing, not an enemy.

0:01:27.940,0:01:34.020
See me - my challenges turned to blessings.

0:01:34.020,0:01:43.260
Say with me, "My challenges turned to blessings".

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:48.700,0:01:51.320
Thank You, Lord.

0:01:51.320,0:01:59.440
Viewers, take this: Don't quit your marriage because of challenges.

0:01:59.440,0:02:04.520
Challenges could be this, could be that. Whatever they say about your wife or your husband -

0:02:04.520,0:02:11.160
your husband is this, your husband is a womanizer, your wife is a womanizer -

0:02:11.160,0:02:14.220
all challenges, situation.

0:02:14.220,0:02:27.400
Whatever they say, don't quit your marriage. Ask God.

0:02:27.400,0:02:31.200
In every situation, God has something to say.

0:02:31.200,0:02:36.900
If you ask God, "God, with this situation now, what will I do?" - God will tell you what to do.

0:02:36.900,0:02:45.840
Sometimes, these challenges are blessings to strengthen marriage or relationships.

0:02:45.840,0:02:50.600
When you see a wonderful relationship or great marriage today,

0:02:50.600,0:02:58.520
ask them and they will tell you how many times great challenges came.

0:02:58.520,0:03:11.640
They refused to quit but today, they are role-models.

0:03:11.640,0:03:16.280
"Ah, I love that husband and wife. I love them. Look at their home - wonderful!"

0:03:16.280,0:03:29.100
Ask them what they have gone through. They will tell you a story that you could not bear.

0:03:29.100,0:03:36.700
A story that divorced your marriage. A story that separated you from your relationship.

0:03:36.700,0:03:39.940
But yet, they stand together.

0:03:39.940,0:03:44.000
50% of  us here are a good example of what I'm talking about.

0:03:44.000,0:03:52.720
You know before now, some years in the past, your impression about T.B. Joshua was so bad.

0:03:52.720,0:04:00.000
Many of you were asked to pray against me, in your different meetings.

0:04:00.000,0:04:04.220
But I refused to pray against you because I knew you will be coming here one day.

0:04:04.220,0:04:10.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:10.800,0:04:16.740
When you were asking God to bind me, to loose me, to bind me, to loose me -

0:04:16.740,0:04:20.480
there is nothing you have not said in your fasting and prayer, but I kept quiet

0:04:20.480,0:04:24.100
because I knew you would be coming. You are welcome.

0:04:24.100,0:04:28.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:28.420,0:04:33.940
Let's assume while you were binding me, loosing me, I too was standing here to loose you, to bind you.

0:04:33.940,0:04:37.380
If you could not bind me, I would have bound you.

0:04:37.380,0:04:39.960
If you could not loose me, I would have loosed you.

0:04:39.960,0:04:43.360
If you could not deliver me, I would have delivered you. Something would have happened.

0:04:43.360,0:04:46.380
You take a stone, you throw it at me

0:04:46.380,0:04:50.100
If I show you many stones - your own stones, I stored them.

0:04:50.100,0:04:54.640
Instead of taking it and throwing it back, I said, "No, I will not throw this stone back".

0:04:54.640,0:05:00.460
I kept the stone because I knew you would be coming back here.

0:05:00.460,0:05:04.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:04.040,0:05:07.220
You know, it's a stone you are throwing when you say,

0:05:07.220,0:05:11.200
"Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, this man is a devil, is this..."

0:05:11.200,0:05:16.360
You are throwing stones and each stone bounces in front of me.

0:05:16.360,0:05:20.980
I look at it. God says, "No, don't throw it back!"

0:05:20.980,0:05:25.420
Assume I throw the stone back - if you cannot deliver me, I will deliver you.

0:05:25.420,0:05:30.940
But today, you are here. This is a good example of what I'm talking about.

0:05:30.940,0:05:35.240
You destroy relationships beyond repair.

0:05:35.240,0:05:41.280
When people offend you, your attitude, your behavior -

0:05:41.280,0:05:46.660
you curse the person to the extent that that relationship will not be repaired again.

0:05:46.660,0:05:49.680
That is exactly what many of you are going through now.

0:05:49.680,0:05:59.080
When you know that this person that is bad now can be the best tomorrow, you will take precaution.

0:05:59.080,0:06:08.900
Do you know that someone who is satan today to you, can be your saviour tomorrow?

0:06:08.900,0:06:14.020
I don't destroy relationships beyond repair.

0:06:14.020,0:06:17.920
If I have you as a friend, no matter what you have done to me,

0:06:17.920,0:06:22.040
I will make sure I will not destroy that relationship beyond repair.

0:06:22.040,0:06:27.140
because I know tomorrow, you may be my saviour.

0:06:27.140,0:06:31.540
Brother, come. See my brother here.

0:06:31.540,0:06:36.120
No matter if I am a friend to my brother here - we are very close friends -

0:06:36.120,0:06:40.160
no matter what happens between us, no matter what the attempt,

0:06:40.160,0:06:47.480
if I learn that he is trying to murder me, to kill me, to destroy me and God protects me,

0:06:47.480,0:06:53.080
I will make sure that that relationship will not be destroyed through me beyond repair

0:06:53.080,0:06:59.180
because I know tomorrow, this man may be there for me.

0:06:59.180,0:07:04.480
But if I now, because of what this man wants to do to me and God protects me,

0:07:04.480,0:07:09.340
I now begin to fight back beyond repair,

0:07:09.340,0:07:14.780
I will not be able to have this opportunity in the future, tomorrow.

0:07:14.780,0:07:25.720
But today, you destroy relationships beyond repair because of situations, challenges, conflicts.

0:07:25.720,0:07:32.700
Tell your neighbour, "You have been destroying your relationships with people beyond repair,

0:07:32.700,0:07:37.660
because of conflicts, trouble and challenges.

0:07:37.660,0:07:49.640
You have been destroying your relationships with people beyond repair".

0:07:49.640,0:07:58.700
You can fight but be conscious that the person you are fighting may be your saviour tomorrow.

0:07:58.700,0:08:05.960
Don't destroy that relationship beyond what? - Repair.

0:08:05.960,0:08:10.900
This is the situation many of you find yourself in today. All of you. All.

0:08:10.900,0:08:16.380
There are many people you know - very very great and they were very close to you.

0:08:16.380,0:08:19.180
They were your enemy in the past.

0:08:19.180,0:08:25.040
Because of fight, you used your hand to destroy that relationship beyond repair.

0:08:25.040,0:08:29.760
Today, you can't just have that goal to meet them.

0:08:29.760,0:08:35.560
Even marriage, your former husband - you divorced and separated -

0:08:35.560,0:08:39.160
that relationship should not be destroyed beyond repair.

0:08:39.160,0:08:42.860
That is your former marriage and you divorced, you left the marriage.

0:08:42.860,0:08:46.240
That man can be someone who is your saviour tomorrow.

0:08:46.240,0:08:50.540
You woman too can be a saviour to that man tomorrow.

0:08:50.540,0:08:57.840
I am a good example. People have destroyed their relationship with me beyond repair.

0:08:57.840,0:09:08.420
Today, imagine I stand here and say, "Hey,  praise the Lord. That man is devil, he is evil spirit.

0:09:08.420,0:09:11.280
He drinks blood. he did that...".

0:09:11.280,0:09:14.660
If you now see me with the man tomorrow, how will you feel?

0:09:14.660,0:09:18.040
The church is scattered. You will leave my church.

0:09:18.040,0:09:22.860
"T.B - you said yesterday that the man is a devil. You said the man drinks blood.

0:09:22.860,0:09:30.880
You are now flirting with the man. It means you people are drinking blood together."

0:09:30.880,0:09:36.660
That is the problem. This is why I'm just alone here.

0:09:36.660,0:09:43.360
Imagine I stand here to say, "Hey, that church is devil, that church drinks blood, that man is not good.

0:09:43.360,0:09:52.040
That man is this, that man is that". - I have said it, and all of you know. And it is televised on Emmanuel TV.

0:09:52.040,0:09:58.020
So, if you now see me with the man I said is drinking blood, is a devil,

0:09:58.020,0:10:02.880
you know he is a devil, you can bet it, and you now see me tomorrow with the man,

0:10:02.880,0:10:07.300
will you still be a member of my church?

0:10:07.300,0:10:12.920
Ah! You have to leave because we are drinking blood together.

0:10:12.920,0:10:18.360
That is, destroy relationships beyond repair.

0:10:18.360,0:10:20.980
That is the life I live.

0:10:20.980,0:10:25.160
When I know the argument is too hot, I keep quiet

0:10:25.160,0:10:29.700
because I don't want to destroy the relationship beyond repair.

0:10:29.700,0:10:33.900
That is why people, the whole world says, "T. B. Joshua will not reply".

0:10:33.900,0:10:38.580
That is the slogan people say - "Ah, that man will not talk."

0:10:38.580,0:10:43.200
If you say, "T.B. Joshua is this, is that", no matter what you say about T.B. Joshua, he will not talk.

0:10:43.200,0:10:47.760
The reason is that I don't want to destroy any relationship beyond repair

0:10:47.760,0:10:57.480
because the man I'm fighting may be my saviour tomorrow.

0:10:57.480,0:11:02.820
So, it's better I should choose the side of silence.

0:11:02.820,0:11:07.340
If I remain silent, you don't know what is in my mind. I will just remain silent.

0:11:07.340,0:11:13.360
This is why the noise everywhere, they say, "He is not replying, he is not this" - I will not talk

0:11:13.360,0:11:21.100
because the man that is fighting me, the man that wants me to die may be my saviour tomorrow.

0:11:21.100,0:11:24.520
Tomorrow is mystery.

0:11:24.520,0:11:27.460
So, I don't want to destroy that relationship.

0:11:27.460,0:11:31.960
If tomorrow he is my saviour, I can still walk majestically towards him.

0:11:31.960,0:11:37.600
I will tell him, "I never said anything when you were abusing me. I never said anything.

0:11:37.600,0:11:40.800
Quote me, what did I say?" He will say, "You never said anything".

0:11:40.800,0:11:44.300
"Ok, let the relationship continue."

0:11:44.300,0:11:49.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:49.960,0:11:57.680
I think this will help you in many things you have in court - going to court, sueing this, that.

0:11:57.680,0:12:02.520
Many things you say, 'over your dead body', your former wife, your former husband,

0:12:02.520,0:12:06.680
whatever he might have done to you yesterday, whatever -

0:12:06.680,0:12:11.380
I think you can still look to see what you can quickly do.

0:12:11.380,0:12:15.260
If you say you are too big, what of your children?

0:12:15.260,0:12:20.540
If I say, "I'm too big to be helped", what of my children?

0:12:20.540,0:12:25.200
The person who wants me to die can be my children's saviour tomorrow.

0:12:25.200,0:12:31.240
Madam, you are crying. Come. What happened?

0:12:31.240,0:12:38.840
Man of God, I am going through that situation.

0:12:38.840,0:12:41.400
I have been so hurt so much by...

0:12:41.400,0:12:46.540
Don't worry. Sit down. The message really touched her.

0:12:46.540,0:12:53.700
She cannot bear it again and started crying, saying, "Ah! Oh! This message is talking to me!"

0:12:53.700,0:12:57.920
Please, don't destroy relationships beyond repair. Tell your neighbour.

0:12:57.920,0:13:00.400
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:00.400,0:13:01.740
Tell your neighbour again.

0:13:01.740,0:13:03.740
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:03.740,0:13:05.460
Tell your neighbour, please.

0:13:05.460,0:13:07.300
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:07.300,0:13:09.260
Stand up and say it to yourself.

0:13:09.260,0:13:12.260
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:12.260,0:13:14.360
Tell viewers all over the world.

0:13:14.360,0:13:16.820
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:16.820,0:13:18.520
I can't hear you.

0:13:18.520,0:13:20.860
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:20.860,0:13:22.160
I can't hear you.

0:13:22.160,0:13:24.580
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:24.580,0:13:26.120
Again and again.

0:13:26.120,0:13:28.700
[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]

0:13:28.700,0:13:30.360
That's all.

When there is a hot argument, look at the person who is after you.

0:13:43.820,0:13:45.920
He may be the saviour tomorrow.

0:13:45.920,0:13:50.400
You may be seated. Thank you. Hallelujah.
