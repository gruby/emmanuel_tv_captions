Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.020,0:00:03.660
My name is Andries Coetzee.

0:00:03.660,0:00:05.540
I'm coming from South Africa.

0:00:05.540,0:00:08.800
This is my fiancée Jacqueline.

0:00:08.800,0:00:12.660
This is our baby boy Ethan Coetzee.

0:00:12.660,0:00:21.780
The thing that brought me to The SCOAN was addiction to drugs, cigarettes and drinking.

0:00:21.780,0:00:26.600
I smoked for 22 years and drank for 22 years.

0:00:26.600,0:00:30.540
In between that, I used drugs as a habit.

0:00:30.540,0:00:35.800
In the morning, afternoon and when I wanted to go to bed, I wanted to do drugs.

0:00:35.800,0:00:40.500
I used abusive words on my fiancée.

0:00:40.500,0:00:48.020
I met her three and a half years ago and things were not good with us.

0:00:48.020,0:00:55.080
I never wanted to go to church; I never wanted to talk to God or talk to anybody.

0:00:55.080,0:00:58.440
I just wanted to be by myself and do my work.

0:00:58.440,0:01:04.200
I would be aggressive to work colleagues, especially the ones who were closest to me.

0:01:04.200,0:01:10.280
I had done it for twenty-two years and eight months.

0:01:10.280,0:01:17.640
I have bruises and marks all over my body that I can show you

0:01:17.640,0:01:23.140
because I was drinking and acting aggressively.

0:01:23.140,0:01:29.240
At what age did you start smoking, drinking alcohol?

0:01:29.240,0:01:34.120
Since the age of 16 or 15.

0:01:34.120,0:01:35.840
It has been for how many years now?

0:01:35.840,0:01:39.400
That is about 23 years exactly.

0:01:39.400,0:01:41.440
You said you had some scars on your body.

0:01:41.440,0:01:45.860
Can you show us and tell us these scars came about?

0:01:45.860,0:01:51.640
This is caused by alcohol aggression.

0:01:51.640,0:01:58.000
I would get annoyed and would just want to fight for no reason.

0:01:58.000,0:02:05.720
I was just like the devil was at the back of my mind telling me, “You have to do this”.

0:02:05.720,0:02:09.900
This one was caused by drinking beer.

0:02:09.900,0:02:12.000
This one was caused by smoking weed.

0:02:12.000,0:02:20.800
This one took more than 17 stitches and it was also caused by drugs I was using.

0:02:20.800,0:02:25.400
This one on my leg was from two years ago.

0:02:25.400,0:02:26.780
I got annoyed in the house.

0:02:26.780,0:02:33.820
I wanted to make trouble with me fiancée.

0:02:33.820,0:02:42.420
I took my clothes out of the drawer and started tearing them with a knife.

0:02:42.420,0:02:45.560
It was bad and I started abusing her.

0:02:45.560,0:02:47.780
What happened, how did you get that injury?

0:02:47.780,0:02:51.420
I stepped on the pants and wanted to cut them with a knife.

0:02:51.420,0:02:55.320
The knife didn’t go through the pants; it went straight to my leg.

0:02:55.320,0:02:57.100
It was after taking alcohol?

0:02:57.100,0:02:59.240
It was after taking alcohol.

0:02:59.240,0:03:02.340
You say you smoked cigarettes and what?

0:03:02.340,0:03:05.140
Weed.

0:03:05.140,0:03:08.500
Each time you smoked...

0:03:08.500,0:03:10.740
How did it make you feel?

0:03:10.740,0:03:15.160
How did that affect your life generally?

0:03:15.160,0:03:26.200
It affected the ones close to me most – the annoyance, abuse, fighting and bad temper.

0:03:26.200,0:03:30.860
It affected them and it affected me in a bad way.

0:03:30.860,0:03:32.980
How did the miracle happen?

0:03:32.980,0:03:37.940
My fiancée has a friend in Ghana whom we called.

0:03:37.940,0:03:49.340
One day I said to my fiancée, “Please can you ask your friend for one package from The SCOAN?”

0:03:49.340,0:03:51.400
So, my fiancée spoke to her.

0:03:51.400,0:03:55.900
How did you get to know about The SCOAN?

0:03:55.900,0:03:57.980
I started watching.

0:03:57.980,0:04:04.780
We have DSTV so I changed the channel and saw Emmanuel TV.

0:04:04.780,0:04:14.180
I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying and I saw all these great testimonies and people being healed.

0:04:14.180,0:04:16.820
I said I wanted to give my life to God

0:04:16.820,0:04:21.840
because the way I was living was not the way of God; it was the way of the devil.

0:04:21.840,0:04:31.940
Did you, at any time, try to stop these dangerous habits: smoking, taking weeds and alcohol?

0:04:31.940,0:04:38.820
Yes, I made more than seven attempts but there was absolutely nothing, none at all.

0:04:38.820,0:04:41.260
When you saw the Emmanuel TV, what happened?

0:04:41.260,0:04:46.780
When I saw Emmanuel TV, I saw all these great testimonies coming from people.

0:04:46.780,0:04:53.380
I saw people getting healed and delivered.

0:04:53.380,0:04:58.740
That was when I started talking to my fiancée, telling her I needed to change my life

0:04:58.740,0:05:05.380
because my life was going in a wrong direction.

0:05:05.380,0:05:11.800
After asking her friend to get the Morning Water package for us,

0:05:11.800,0:05:18.800
we got it on a Tuesday and we started to pray and anoint ourselves.

0:05:18.800,0:05:24.180
We went on our knees and I said, “God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, if You are there,

0:05:24.180,0:05:32.180
please, listen to me, help me and answer my prayers as I do not want to be the same person”.

0:05:32.180,0:05:34.720
So, you have never been here before?

0:05:34.720,0:05:35.760
Never.

0:05:35.760,0:05:37.060
Wow.

0:05:37.060,0:05:43.840
You requested the package of the Morning Water and after praying with it, the miracle happened.

0:05:43.840,0:05:48.920
Tell us how this addiction finally stopped.

0:05:48.920,0:05:53.220
On Tuesday we got it, we started praying and using it.

0:05:53.220,0:05:56.360
We went on our knees and I started reading the Bible.

0:05:56.360,0:06:02.100
I said, “Please, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, please listen to my prayers, please answer my prayers.

0:06:02.100,0:06:06.600
I know You are annoyed with me because of the wrong doings in my life

0:06:06.600,0:06:11.940
but I know I can change my life around because with You, all things are possible”.

0:06:11.940,0:06:21.360
Nothing is impossible so I said to my fiancée that it is better we use the Morning Water.

0:06:21.360,0:06:26.640
Wow, we can see the emotional expression there.

0:06:26.640,0:06:36.400
We all believe this is born out of great joy, of a deliverance from a bondage of so many years.

0:06:36.400,0:06:38.740
So, after the prayer...?

0:06:38.740,0:06:46.040
After the prayer, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I started feeling itching on my body.

0:06:46.040,0:06:51.260
We took the CD of Prophet T.B. Joshua where he was prophesying.

0:06:51.260,0:06:55.220
We put it in and started listening to the words.

0:06:55.220,0:07:01.440
We went on our knees and touched the TV and I and my fiancée said,

0:07:01.440,0:07:05.140
“Please, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, turn our lives around

0:07:05.140,0:07:09.580
because it is only You who can do it for us; nobody else can do it”.

0:07:09.580,0:07:16.400
Only God can do good things in your life because you cannot do any good thing.

0:07:16.400,0:07:19.140
I started to itch badly.

0:07:19.140,0:07:23.980
For more than thirty to forty minutes, I started to itch all over my body.

0:07:23.980,0:07:31.120
I said to my fiancée, “I’m not feeling well. There is something wrong; I don’t know what’s going on”.

0:07:31.120,0:07:32.320
We went to the room.

0:07:32.320,0:07:36.520
I took off all my clothes and put on new clothes; I thought it was my clothes.

0:07:36.520,0:07:39.360
I said, “No, something is really wrong”.

0:07:39.360,0:07:42.500
I put on the new clothes but I was still itching.

0:07:42.500,0:07:46.740
I went to the back of the door and started scratching my back

0:07:46.740,0:07:51.800
because my back was itching and all over was itching.

0:07:51.800,0:07:56.380
After forty-five minutes of itching, I went on my knees and started to pray.

0:07:56.380,0:08:03.180
I said, “God, please tell me what is happening because I do not know what is happening with myself".

0:08:03.180,0:08:11.060
I have some photos my fiancée took when it was happening.

0:08:11.060,0:08:16.640
After the itching, what happened?

0:08:16.640,0:08:19.140
That is the best part of everything.

0:08:19.140,0:08:22.980
After the itching, I went down on my knees and prayed.

0:08:22.980,0:08:28.780
After praying, I went to the porch – I usually smoked and drank on the porch.

0:08:28.780,0:08:30.940
I went and sat on the porch.

0:08:30.940,0:08:34.660
I took the cigarette and as soon as I lit it and put it in my mouth,

0:08:34.660,0:08:38.860
I said, “Something is not tasting well” and I threw the cigarette down.

0:08:38.860,0:08:42.000
It has been more than two months now that I have not touched beer!

0:08:42.000,0:08:44.980
I do not touch alcohol, cigarettes or drugs!

0:08:44.980,0:08:45.700
Nothing!

0:08:45.700,0:08:48.780
Hallelujah!

0:08:48.780,0:08:50.660
Glory be to God!

0:08:50.660,0:08:55.100
You have some pictures to show us there.

0:08:55.100,0:08:59.540
We would like you to explain what we can see on those pictures.

0:08:59.540,0:09:05.700
This was just after watching the CD when I stared scratching.

0:09:05.700,0:09:09.660
I had scratches on the back and the front.

0:09:09.660,0:09:10.860
This is one of the photos.

0:09:10.860,0:09:13.360
The other one - if you can turn...

0:09:13.360,0:09:16.880
You didn't understand what was itching all over your body?

0:09:16.880,0:09:19.160
Nothing at all.

0:09:19.160,0:09:27.020
The moment the itching stopped - you mean that was the end of urge to smoke and drink?

0:09:27.020,0:09:29.120
That was the end of everything.

0:09:29.120,0:09:33.600
Really, there was no taste for cigarettes.

0:09:33.600,0:09:37.300
I didn’t look at beer; I didn’t want to drink it.

0:09:37.300,0:09:38.980
I just want to tell God, “Thank You!”

0:09:38.980,0:09:44.400
Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!

0:09:44.400,0:09:47.680
Can we hear a word or two from your fiancée?

0:09:47.680,0:09:50.140
My name is Jacqueline.

0:09:50.140,0:09:53.160
I'm from Liberia.

0:09:53.160,0:10:00.660
This is my fiancé and this is my little baby boy.

0:10:00.660,0:10:03.940
My fiancé has already explained it all.

0:10:03.940,0:10:09.340
Since I met him three years ago, he had been smoking a lot.

0:10:09.340,0:10:15.020
He could smoke three to four packets of cigarettes a day.

0:10:15.020,0:10:18.380
Sometimes, I would really get annoyed with him and would say,

0:10:18.380,0:10:22.680
“Please leave the cigarettes; they are not good for you and they are not good for your health”.

0:10:22.680,0:10:25.560
He would say, “Oh, leave me”.

0:10:25.560,0:10:27.480
Sometimes, even if we didn’t have money,

0:10:27.480,0:10:33.260
we would borrow cigarettes from the nearest shop just for him to smoke.

0:10:33.260,0:10:41.020
It was really bothering me but I just gave all to God, for God to take control.

0:10:41.020,0:10:47.320
Last year in November, we were watching Emmanuel TV.

0:10:47.320,0:10:54.600
I had been seeing a lot of testimonies and the goodness of God through this ministry.

0:10:54.600,0:11:00.040
So I told him that we should always watch Emmanuel TV.

0:11:00.040,0:11:07.860
Every night and every morning, we watch Emmanuel TV and then we pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:11:07.860,0:11:12.620
One day, I called my friend and I said it would be better if we got the Morning Water package

0:11:12.620,0:11:17.580
because through the Morning Water, I had seen a lot of people get their deliverance.

0:11:17.580,0:11:20.260
I believed that we would have our deliverance, too.

0:11:20.260,0:11:24.120
I asked one of my friends in Ghana and she helped.

0:11:24.120,0:11:27.140
She came here and got one Morning Water package for us.

0:11:27.140,0:11:32.260
She sent it to us and as God would have it, we got it.

0:11:32.260,0:11:36.840
It was on a Tuesday we started ministering the Morning Water.

0:11:36.840,0:11:42.620
I ministered it on him first and then I ministered it on myself and on our baby.

0:11:42.620,0:11:44.820
We started praying just like that.

0:11:44.820,0:11:50.460
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and on Friday we watched the CD.

0:11:50.460,0:11:55.000
As we were watching the CD, we put our hands on the screen.

0:11:55.000,0:12:03.040
Then, I just saw my fiancé scratch his body for thirty to forty-five minutes.

0:12:03.040,0:12:05.360
I asked him what was going on.

0:12:05.360,0:12:08.000
He said he didn’t know and was even confused.

0:12:08.000,0:12:13.580
I said, “OK, let’s go into the room” because we had guests in the house.

0:12:13.580,0:12:18.060
I said, “Let’s go into the room and I will minister the Morning Water on you”.

0:12:18.060,0:12:20.420
We went into the room and took all his clothes off.

0:12:20.420,0:12:25.000
He said, “Maybe the clothes are doing this; maybe they weren’t washed well”.

0:12:25.000,0:12:30.260
I said, “I don’t think so; I think it’s your deliverance”.

0:12:30.260,0:12:33.060
He took off his clothes and I started spraying.

0:12:33.060,0:12:39.340
I said, “You demon, be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!

0:12:39.340,0:12:42.080
You demon, wherever you are, you do not belong in this body!

0:12:42.080,0:12:43.940
Be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!”

0:12:43.940,0:12:45.640
And then we started praying.

0:12:45.640,0:12:50.880
I said, “God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I know this is our deliverance, in Jesus’ name!”

0:12:50.880,0:12:56.640
I started spraying; that was how he came to himself and then we prayed.

0:12:56.640,0:12:57.700
And since then...?

0:12:57.700,0:13:00.360
Since then, he stopped taking cigarettes.

0:13:00.360,0:13:02.760
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:13:02.760,0:13:07.280
Andries Coetzee & Family
Morning Water Testimony

0:13:07.280,0:13:09.940
The next day, my baby fell sick.

0:13:09.940,0:13:16.560
His stomach started running so we took him to the hospital.

0:13:16.560,0:13:19.600
The Morning Sticker – I put it in my baby’s clothes.

0:13:19.600,0:13:21.560
His stomach was running and he was vomiting.

0:13:21.560,0:13:24.220
He was helpless.

0:13:24.220,0:13:28.580
They admitted him and the next morning, as God would have it, he was healed.

0:13:28.580,0:13:31.760
I told my husband and he said we should go to South Africa.

0:13:31.760,0:13:34.020
I said no, we have to come to Nigeria.

0:13:34.020,0:13:36.160
This is our first time here.

0:13:36.160,0:13:38.840
We had to come and testify to the goodness of God.

0:13:38.840,0:13:42.700
Hallelujah!
Put your hand together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:42.700,0:13:46.840
Thank you very much.

0:13:46.840,0:13:54.640
Lastly, can we hear a word of advice from you?

0:13:54.640,0:14:01.520
I would advise people around the world that have addictions to cigarettes, drugs and alcohol

0:14:01.520,0:14:06.640
to change your life to God because only God can deliver you from this evil.

0:14:06.640,0:14:11.520
Because it is evil; it is a spirit that is not supposed to be in your body.

0:14:11.520,0:14:16.100
Brother, turn yourself to God because God can do wonders.

0:14:16.100,0:14:17.000
Thank you.

0:14:17.000,0:14:18.100
Thank you very much.

0:14:18.100,0:14:20.860
Glory be to God!

0:14:20.860,0:14:27.780
We also want to encourage you, now that Jesus Christ has proven His power in your life, -

0:14:27.780,0:14:33.160
it is not enough to come to Jesus to receive help and spiritual healing...

0:14:33.160,0:14:37.360
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that when we are healed, blessed or delivered,

0:14:37.360,0:14:41.960
we must follow Jesus Christ, who is the Healer, the blessing Provider,

0:14:41.960,0:14:46.960
and make His Word the standard for our lives, so that whatever we receive from Him

0:14:46.960,0:14:50.940
will be permanent, and even will multiply, in Jesus' name!

0:14:50.940,0:14:55.500
