The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature and although

0:00:08.060,0:00:12.360
it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.

0:00:12.360,0:00:16.940
As this woman sits down at the SCOAN,

0:00:16.940,0:00:24.200
we can tell by the look on her face that she is in a great deal of pain and discomfort.

0:00:24.200,0:00:31.460
As the camera moves down here body; what is revealed is a gustily wound at the top of her thigh,

0:00:31.460,0:00:34.400
which has become cancerous.

0:00:34.400,0:00:43.320
The woman by name Adia Umina had come to the SCOAN  with pelvic cancer dripping with pus.

0:00:43.320,0:00:50.820
The open sore causes Adia great pain and her face tells the sad story of what she is going through.

0:00:50.820,0:00:56.320
The pelvic cancer had already eaten deep into the flesh of her right thigh,

0:00:56.320,0:01:01.420
which hangs disfigured as the sickness digs deeper yet.

0:01:01.420,0:01:08.140
As the camera pulls out, we see that the cancer is located at the top of the thigh of her right leg.

0:01:08.140,0:01:14.780
Ordinarily someone in this condition would have little hope of recovering their leg from such an affliction.

0:01:14.780,0:01:18.960
The life depending on painful amputation to survive.

0:01:18.960,0:01:24.080
However, faith makes that which seems to be against us to be for us.

0:01:24.080,0:01:29.320
Let us hear from the woman as she waits for prayer at the SCOAN

0:01:29.320,0:01:33.040
Madam tell us what is your name.(Adia Umina)

0:01:33.040,0:01:37.100
Tell us what  is the problem that brought you to SCOAN today.

0:01:37.100,0:01:43.000
Cancer in my body.

0:01:43.000,0:01:45.860
You say the cancer brought you to Synagogue today?

0:01:45.860,0:01:47.100
Yes

0:01:47.100,0:01:53.580
It is painful; l cannot sleep. I am worried and  I cannot walk.

0:01:53.580,0:01:55.720
Where did you go for help?

0:01:55.720,0:01:56.960
I had been to the chemist to search for solution.

0:01:56.960,0:02:00.500
How did you know about Synagogue.

0:02:00.520,0:02:03.180
Somebody directed me to the SCOAN

0:02:03.180,0:02:07.060
I believe that God will heal me of the sickness.

0:02:07.060,0:02:11.320
With that belief in her heart that Jesus Christ was able to heal her

0:02:11.320,0:02:14.620
as she sat silently before the mountain of her life.

0:02:14.620,0:02:20.940
She was arranged in The Synagogue Church Of All Nations Prayer Line for prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:20.940,0:02:26.820
Here she sat at the prayer line of Synagogue Church Of All Nations with an open wound of a pelvic cancer

0:02:26.820,0:02:32.540
praying to attract God's attention and commitment through the Man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:32.540,0:02:38.100
As she receives prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit she rises to her feet.

0:02:38.100,0:02:43.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua uses his hand as a point of contact and prays for her

0:02:43.060,0:02:46.080
and tells her to go for she has been set free.

0:02:46.080,0:02:50.620
Jesus Christ the miracle worker has done it again in her life.

0:02:50.620,0:02:55.900
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:55.900,0:03:00.380
Some months later Adia Umina came back to the SCOAN

0:03:00.380,0:03:06.900
to show how the Lord Jesus Christ had performed the word of His servant and healed her body completely.

0:03:06.900,0:03:11.800
There is only a scar remaining of the once malignant pelvic cancer

0:03:11.800,0:03:14.380
which had threatened her life.

0:03:14.380,0:03:17.080
Now healed, she taps the place.

0:03:17.080,0:03:18.100
Do you feel pain?

0:03:18.100,0:03:19.480
No.

0:03:19.480,0:03:23.880
Now tell us what was the problem that brought you to SCOAN.

0:03:23.880,0:03:25.380
It is cancer

0:03:25.380,0:03:27.880
You mean pelvic cancer?

0:03:27.880,0:03:28.880
Yes

0:03:28.880,0:03:32.200
The problem is over. I am happy and I thank God.

0:03:32.200,0:03:36.580
Where did you go to look for solution to that kind of problem?

0:03:36.580,0:03:39.060
I went to hospital and spent a lot money but there was no solution.

0:03:39.060,0:03:42.620
I nearly died before I was brought here to SCOAN.

0:03:42.620,0:03:45.840
You mean to say there was no solution before you came to SCOAN? (Yes)

0:03:45.840,0:03:48.040
Madam let us see that place again.

0:03:48.040,0:03:49.740
To God be the glory.

0:03:49.740,0:03:55.800
All that remains of the life threatening sore is this thin mark on her thigh.

0:03:55.800,0:03:58.880
Who else could justly heal her?

0:03:58.880,0:04:01.980
Who else could justly restore her?

0:04:01.980,0:04:05.760
Who else could have done this but Jesus Christ?

0:04:05.760,0:04:12.200
So glad was she at the hand work of God in her life that she shows the place and taps it once again

0:04:12.200,0:04:14.820
demonstrating that there is no more pain.

0:04:14.820,0:04:16.180
Do you feel pain?

0:04:16.180,0:04:19.140
I no longer feel any pain.

0:04:19.140,0:04:21.520
Before, it was like a big hole.

0:04:21.520,0:04:23.860
My leg was nearly amputated.

0:04:23.860,0:04:30.600
With the healing complete Adia Umina then gave a testimony live at the church.

0:04:30.600,0:04:34.840
My name is Adia Umina. I am from Cross River States.

0:04:34.840,0:04:39.340
What was the problem that brought you to the SCOAN?

0:04:39.340,0:04:40.720
It was cancer.

0:04:40.720,0:04:45.320
I had been to hospital and herbalist in search of a  solution.

0:04:45.320,0:04:51.740
I had spent a lot of money to the extend that I didn't have money anymore.

0:04:51.740,0:04:53.720
I nearly died.

0:04:53.720,0:04:59.400
It was my neighbour who directed me to SCOAN

0:04:59.400,0:05:05.360
When I was brought to the prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.

0:05:05.360,0:05:08.240
Prophet T.B. Joshua was used by God to heal you.

0:05:08.240,0:05:10.080
Prophet T.B. Joshua did not even touch my head,

0:05:10.080,0:05:14.500
he just stretched his hand towards me and I was healed.

0:05:14.500,0:05:17.400
So he just shook his hand towards you.

0:05:17.400,0:05:19.700
So what happened immediately?

0:05:19.700,0:05:25.440
From there , I felt coldness in my body and I was healed.

0:05:25.440,0:05:28.460
To God be the glory.

0:05:28.460,0:05:35.680
Just open that place and let us see the place where the problem was there before.

0:05:35.680,0:05:39.940
As she testifies to the congregation Adia Umina lifts up her clothes

0:05:39.940,0:05:43.100
to show the evidence of God's miracle in her life.

0:05:43.100,0:05:46.240
Now without pain she vigorously taps it

0:05:46.240,0:05:49.680
to prove beyond doubt that she is completely healed.

0:05:49.680,0:05:52.020
To God be the glory.

0:05:52.020,0:05:53.400
I don't feel pain anymore.

0:05:53.400,0:05:56.840
Put your hands together for Jesus one more time.
