The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:01.500,0:00:03.000
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:03.000,0:00:04.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:04.940,0:00:11.500
Viewers all over the world, I know you were joining them dancing.

0:00:11.500,0:00:14.660
There is nothing anybody can do.

0:00:14.660,0:00:17.440
That is your belief.

0:00:17.440,0:00:20.000
Your belief is solid.

0:00:20.000,0:00:30.760
I say your belief is solid because you are acting on what God has spoken.

0:00:30.760,0:00:36.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:36.840,0:00:47.380
There are some people here that while many here were dancing, they were doing like this.

0:00:47.380,0:00:48.240
Why?

0:00:48.240,0:00:53.460
They were trying to act on what God had not spoken.

0:00:53.460,0:00:59.560
When you are trying to act on what God has not spoken,

0:00:59.560,0:01:06.280
you force yourself to believe in what God has not spoken

0:01:06.280,0:01:09.880
that is not believing.

0:01:09.880,0:01:18.240
You are dreaming, acting on your own imagination.

0:01:18.240,0:01:22.540
We need to know God's will and act accordingly.

0:01:22.540,0:01:25.160
If I allow you again, you are ready.

0:01:25.160,0:01:28.260
So, I have to congratulate you for your belief.

0:01:28.260,0:01:35.620
The word belief - believing is simply acting on what God has spoken.

0:01:35.620,0:01:36.920
Simple.

0:01:36.920,0:01:43.660
It makes believing very simple.

0:01:43.660,0:01:45.500
What kind of belief are we talking about?

0:01:45.500,0:01:52.980
Many of us spend two to three days in connecting flights - from one country to another.

0:01:52.980,0:01:55.660
It is difficult nowadays, it is not easy.

0:01:55.660,0:01:59.180
When you fly from one country to another, it is stop-over.

0:01:59.180,0:02:02.560
You may spend three days there.

0:02:02.560,0:02:05.360
We have many people like that here.

0:02:05.360,0:02:13.640
You have paid some price.

0:02:13.640,0:02:15.920
God is aware.

0:02:15.920,0:02:17.080
I can’t hear you.

0:02:17.080,0:02:18.500
Amen.

0:02:18.500,0:02:19.640
I can’t hear you.

0:02:19.640,0:02:21.400
Amen.

0:02:21.400,0:02:22.860
Yes.

0:02:22.860,0:02:30.680
You are actually here because you believe God has promised you.

0:02:30.680,0:02:41.140
If your Father promised to give you something and you base your belief on that,

0:02:41.140,0:02:46.580
that believing is solid.

0:02:46.580,0:02:50.220
I’m not talking of your father at home: I’m talking of God.

0:02:50.220,0:03:02.620
If your Father promised you something and you now base your belief on that,

0:03:02.620,0:03:06.440
this believing is solid.

0:03:06.440,0:03:12.560
This is why we need to know God’s will and act accordingly.

0:03:12.560,0:03:19.280
We need to know God’s promise and act according to His will.

0:03:19.280,0:03:26.560
If you don’t know God's promise, you want healing and you just say, "God, heal me, heal me",

0:03:26.560,0:03:30.640
you may have some problem because you need to know

0:03:30.640,0:03:39.620
whether it is the will of God to heal you at that moment or not - before you open your mouth.

0:03:39.620,0:03:45.360
We know His will before we pray.

0:03:45.360,0:03:47.200
Are you with me?

0:03:47.200,0:03:51.960
If you see any prayer that is answered - let there be light and there is light -

0:03:51.960,0:03:59.140
the person knows God will bring light before he offers his prayer.

0:03:59.140,0:04:02.220
This actually affects our faith.

0:04:02.220,0:04:09.460
Today you don’t know whether you’re a man of faith or not. You don’t know.

0:04:09.460,0:04:17.660
You consider your relationship with God according to the number of prayers that are answered.

0:04:17.660,0:04:21.700
If your prayer is answered, you say, "Oh! God loves me".

0:04:21.700,0:04:24.520
God loves everyone.

0:04:24.520,0:04:26.960
Hallelujah.

0:04:26.960,0:04:42.080
If your Father promised you something and you base your belief on that promise,

0:04:42.080,0:04:47.020
this believing is solid.

0:04:47.020,0:04:57.400
When your Father has not promised you, you force yourself to believe -

0:04:57.400,0:05:12.380
you are not believing but dreaming because you believe in something that is not factual.

0:05:12.380,0:05:17.580
I want to take it back again. The word believing is a difficult issue.

0:05:17.580,0:05:22.140
Believing is between you and salvation.

0:05:22.140,0:05:34.280
Believing is made easy when you know that it is acting on what God has promised,

0:05:34.280,0:05:37.400
on what God has said.

0:05:37.400,0:05:41.120
That is, you must know His will.

0:05:41.120,0:05:44.100
This is why we say, "Let the will of God be done!"

0:05:44.100,0:05:46.000
Do you really mean what you are talking about?

0:05:46.000,0:05:51.300
If it is the will of God to be done in your life and you want to step out for something,

0:05:51.300,0:05:55.260
you must know God will's about it.

0:05:55.260,0:06:08.440
It is when you know God’s will that you can act accordingly to His will before you pray.

0:06:08.440,0:06:14.980
This is why we need to know God’s will and act accordingly.

0:06:14.980,0:06:18.180
It is a prophetic word to your life.

0:06:18.180,0:06:19.080
Take it.

0:06:19.080,0:06:23.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:23.540,0:06:26.240
How do you express your belief?

0:06:26.240,0:06:31.840
You have not based your belief on what God has said.

0:06:31.840,0:06:37.120
You base your belief on what you want, what you are looking for, what you want.

0:06:37.120,0:06:41.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:06:41.140,0:06:47.440
Not on what God has said or what God will do.

0:06:47.440,0:06:51.160
That is why your belief seems to be dreaming.

0:06:51.160,0:06:53.400
You know when you’re dreaming of something,

0:06:53.400,0:06:58.140
it may happen in one year's time or be a kind of imagination.

0:06:58.140,0:07:04.680
Such belief is not factual.

0:07:04.680,0:07:09.980
You are dreaming out of your imagination.

0:07:09.980,0:07:13.740
This is what is happening to us today.

0:07:13.740,0:07:26.860
If God has not promised you something and you force yourself, which today...

0:07:26.860,0:07:34.840
If I did not know God’s will, I would have joined you in the kind of prayer you want to offer.

0:07:34.840,0:07:38.580
But I’m going to pray according to God’s will.

0:07:38.580,0:07:41.020
This is why we are going to receive.

0:07:41.020,0:07:46.240
If I shall allow you to offer your prayer, you would continue to force your belief

0:07:46.240,0:07:49.920
on what God has not said.

0:07:49.920,0:07:56.700
If God has not promised and you force yourself to believe,

0:07:56.700,0:08:03.040
such belief is not factual,

0:08:03.040,0:08:08.480
you are dreaming out of your imagination.

0:08:08.480,0:08:11.860
This is what is happening to us today.

0:08:11.860,0:08:18.820
Everything satan tries to bring in order to destroy us is an advantage to us.

0:08:18.820,0:08:26.380
If satan brings headache, it’s an opportunity to pray the more.

0:08:26.380,0:08:32.220
If satan brings anger, opportunity to move closer to God.

0:08:32.220,0:08:34.540
Hallelujah. Rise up! Thank You, Lord.

0:08:34.540,0:08:38.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:38.120,0:08:42.820
The way and manner God arranged this ministry:

0:08:42.820,0:08:52.520
He arranged it in such a way that it will be very difficult for you to come here without you having faith.

0:08:52.520,0:09:00.860
Ninety to ninety-nine have seen the finger of God before they leave.

0:09:00.860,0:09:09.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:09.160,0:09:13.260
In summary again:

0:09:13.260,0:09:24.640
God’s promise must be known to us before we pray.

0:09:24.640,0:09:25.860
Tell your neighbour.

0:09:25.860,0:09:29.740
God’s promise must be known to us before we pray.

0:09:29.740,0:09:30.860
I can't hear you.

0:09:30.860,0:09:34.360
God’s promise must be known to us before we pray.

0:09:34.360,0:09:40.760
If not, you will continue to be disappointed.

0:09:40.760,0:09:45.860
You will not even know the difference between a miracle and when a strange thing happens.

0:09:45.860,0:09:54.760
If you don’t know God’s promise and you offer prayer,

0:09:54.760,0:10:01.380
when something strange happens, you call it answer from God.

0:10:01.380,0:10:04.260
God’s promise means God’s will.

0:10:04.260,0:10:12.580
In the Bible, anywhere you see God’s promise means God’s will.

0:10:12.580,0:10:17.340
When we know God's will, we act according to His will.

0:10:17.340,0:10:21.140
This is why we say, "Let the will of God be done!"

0:10:21.140,0:10:26.420
This is the problem we are facing today.

0:10:26.420,0:10:31.280
Simply because we cannot define the word faith.

0:10:31.280,0:10:33.060
They cannot.

0:10:33.060,0:10:45.580
Faith is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, reliable, trustworthy.

0:10:45.580,0:10:58.300
It means we are not looking for great faith but great God.

0:10:58.300,0:11:03.060
Great God!

0:11:03.060,0:11:05.320
Who is that ‘other party’?

0:11:05.320,0:11:08.940
Who is reliable in the world?

0:11:08.940,0:11:11.500
Who is trustworthy?

0:11:11.500,0:11:20.320
It is One that has no beginning and no end that can be trusted.

0:11:20.320,0:11:41.660
Faith is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, reliable, trustworthy.

0:11:41.660,0:11:48.160
Where our trouble lies as a Christian is in the word belief.

0:11:48.160,0:11:49.820
The word believe.

0:11:49.820,0:11:53.260
And the word faith.

0:11:53.260,0:11:59.160
Faith and believe. This is just the problem we have.

0:11:59.160,0:12:01.420
There is power in our mouth.

0:12:01.420,0:12:15.300
The belief in our heart is released by faith.

0:12:15.300,0:12:22.320
"Let there be light!" - to release that power, I need faith to release it.

0:12:22.320,0:12:37.520
Faith is a Heavenly resource.

0:12:37.520,0:12:41.880
If you need Heavenly resources, it is faith you use.

0:12:41.880,0:12:48.220
Like if you need to buy something, you need dollar, naira, rand.

0:12:48.220,0:12:51.680
You take money and purchase it.

0:12:51.680,0:13:03.620
Now, you want to get Heavenly things like healing, deliverance, all of God's blessings, salvation,

0:13:03.620,0:13:07.640
you need faith to purchase them.

0:13:07.640,0:13:10.860
They are all Heavenly resources.

0:13:10.860,0:13:15.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:15.320,0:13:26.160
It means that faith can be regarded as a Heavenly currency that purchases Heavenly resources.

0:13:26.160,0:13:30.720
It’s not everything that you can buy with 5 dollars.

0:13:30.720,0:13:34.780
You can't use 5 dollars to buy things costing 10 dollars.

0:13:34.780,0:13:38.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:38.240,0:13:41.380
You now understand the word faith.

0:13:41.380,0:13:43.000
Faith is a Heavenly currency.

0:13:43.000,0:13:43.880
Tell your neighbour.

0:13:43.880,0:13:46.100
Faith is a Heavenly currency.

0:13:46.100,0:13:57.400
What you are able to achieve, depends on the amount of Heavenly currency you have.

0:13:57.400,0:14:05.780
The Heavenly resources you are able to receive depend on the Heavenly currencies you have.

0:14:05.780,0:14:08.980
You cannot purchase more than what you have.

0:14:08.980,0:14:21.420
Faith grows as we continue to read, hear and obey - it grows.

0:14:21.420,0:14:25.020
Tell you neighbour: "Allow your faith to grow".

0:14:25.020,0:14:26.480
I can't hear you.

0:14:26.480,0:14:28.220
Allow your faith to grow

0:14:28.220,0:14:36.180
so that you can purchase greater Heavenly resources.

0:14:36.460,0:14:42.280
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
