0:00:00.000,0:00:11.120
Yes, I give warning; this is warning – a red card to the evil spirits right now.

0:00:11.120,0:00:12.400
Come out!

0:00:12.400,0:00:15.080
I say, "Out!"

0:00:15.080,0:00:23.520
You, evil spirit - leave my people!

0:00:23.520,0:00:29.460
Leave my people!

0:00:29.460,0:00:40.540
She is possessed with spirit of flirting and this spirit has been in the family.

0:00:40.540,0:00:42.080
It will be cast out.

0:00:42.080,0:00:43.700
She is like a dog.

0:00:43.700,0:00:47.960
Dog means, she is just flirting with any man.

0:00:47.960,0:00:51.960
Anytime the spirit comes upon her, she is just like a prostitute.

0:00:51.960,0:00:56.600
She is not going to a hotel but she is flirting around.

0:00:56.600,0:01:00.940
That is the problem she has.

0:01:00.940,0:01:02.880
Jesus loves her.

0:01:02.880,0:01:04.340
What you said is true.

0:01:04.340,0:01:06.380
I came here for freedom.

0:01:06.380,0:01:10.920
I have been praying to God so many times to set me free.

0:01:10.920,0:01:17.620
After the service, the woman who had received the prophecy met T.B. Joshua for her deliverance.

0:01:17.620,0:01:23.600
Here, the man of God ministers prayer and deliverance, with a touch, in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:01:23.600,0:01:28.560
backed up, accompanied by all the power of heaven.

0:01:28.560,0:01:32.620
Her deliverance takes place and she is free.

0:01:32.620,0:01:36.940
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:01:36.940,0:01:41.000
My name is Roberta and I'm coming from Spain.

0:01:41.000,0:01:48.760
First of all, I would like, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, to tell everything, to expose the devil

0:01:48.760,0:01:51.060
and say my testimony today.

0:01:51.060,0:01:55.340
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:01:55.340,0:01:59.100
Indeed, this testimony is to put shame to the devil for what he has done

0:01:59.100,0:02:01.820
and to glorify Jesus for His deliverance in your life.

0:02:01.820,0:02:07.340
Share with us what was the word of prophecy you received last week Sunday.

0:02:07.340,0:02:13.280
T.B. Joshua prophesied that I had the spirit of flirting and it comes from my family

0:02:13.280,0:02:20.860
and the spirit was putting me into the prostitution, but Jesus loves me and He took me out - He saved me.

0:02:20.860,0:02:22.600
Thank You, Jesus.

0:02:22.600,0:02:29.280
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:02:29.280,0:02:34.680
Share with us your experience in life; how can you confirm this prophecy to be true?

0:02:34.680,0:02:37.720
My family was a disaster.

0:02:37.720,0:02:40.020
Everyone...

0:02:40.020,0:02:46.720
I didn't even experience what it means to have a family because everyone is divorced;

0:02:46.720,0:02:50.300
my aunts, my mother and father...

0:02:50.300,0:02:54.060
It was a disaster - I was suffering so much.

0:02:54.060,0:02:55.060
I was praying, "Lord..."

0:02:55.060,0:03:02.340
I remember - when I was little, I wasn't a Christian and I just said, "Me - I am not gonna live like that".

0:03:02.340,0:03:06.100
I was praying, "God, rescue me".

0:03:06.100,0:03:16.360
When I was about 18 years old, my mother used to say, "Oh, women in our family are very sexual. Don't worry -

0:03:16.360,0:03:21.900
it's fine. Go and flirt with the men. It's nothing bad"

0:03:21.900,0:03:28.740
I always had this temptation to talk to guys and get the things I wanted.

0:03:28.740,0:03:31.400
I never understood why...

0:03:31.400,0:03:35.600
Since I was very young, men used to look at me incredibly.

0:03:35.600,0:03:38.220
I never understood what was wrong with me.

0:03:38.220,0:03:45.840
Even when I was dressing up simply, without make-up, without anything, I used to get so much attention

0:03:45.840,0:03:49.120
that I couldn't handle it.

0:03:49.120,0:03:54.620
I didn't have a Spirit of God, at that time.

0:03:54.620,0:04:01.640
I remember, when I was about 18 years old, when I was going back home from the gym,

0:04:01.640,0:04:07.500
there was a man following me and when I entered my house

0:04:07.500,0:04:11.700
he grabbed me and touched my intimate parts.

0:04:11.700,0:04:14.860
He wanted to pull me out of the house.

0:04:14.860,0:04:21.060
But he didn't know that I lived in that neighbourhood and my mother opened the door, and she saw him -

0:04:21.060,0:04:24.480
then he dropped me on the floor and ran away.

0:04:24.480,0:04:30.540
So, God was saving me always from all kinds of situations.

0:04:30.540,0:04:35.700
While I was in serious relationships, I didn't understand why I was looking at the men,

0:04:35.700,0:04:42.880
why I had this feeling for the men, why I wanted...

0:04:42.880,0:04:44.400
I couldn't understand.

0:04:44.400,0:04:47.220
My heart didn't want that but my body, my flesh...

0:04:47.220,0:04:52.760
I was even scared to look at the guy, because when I looked at him, he was getting crazy.

0:04:52.760,0:05:03.460
When I go to the gym, I don't even want to look at anyone because I feel like men wait for my eye-contact.

0:05:03.460,0:05:13.300
Once I accepted Jesus Christ a year ago, the spiritual fight started because I started to feel so bad about it.

0:05:13.300,0:05:22.260
I knew I wasn't having sex with them but I felt so much guilt and disgust inside of me.

0:05:22.260,0:05:31.860
I was asking the Lord, "What's happening? Why do I feel this spiritual fight inside of me?"

0:05:31.860,0:05:36.480
What was in my head... and it's true...

0:05:36.480,0:05:44.720
In my mind I knew that If I wasn't a Christian, I would be going around with all the men and would have pleasure,

0:05:44.720,0:05:45.980
I wouldn't be able to finish that.

0:05:45.980,0:05:47.780
That was in my head.

0:05:47.780,0:05:48.900
That really scarred me.

0:05:48.900,0:05:51.940
I remember one time I came back home because I couldn't be in the church...

0:05:51.940,0:05:55.180
I thought, "I am a Christian, but I feel so dirty and bad".

0:05:55.180,0:06:02.340
I came back home and I was praying to the Lord - I said, "Take my life back to heaven and finish with me,

0:06:02.340,0:06:06.700
or deliver me, because I don't want to live like that."

0:06:06.700,0:06:10.800
So, we can really understand that this spirit of flirting, of a dog,

0:06:10.800,0:06:14.380
has really pushed you around and made your life miserable.

0:06:14.380,0:06:18.480
You mentioned earlier that when you went to a gym it was almost

0:06:18.480,0:06:21.980
as if men were waiting to have contact with your eyes.

0:06:21.980,0:06:22.960
What can you say?

0:06:22.960,0:06:27.280
Do you think there was a power in your eyes?

0:06:27.280,0:06:28.240
Yes.

0:06:28.240,0:06:32.100
I will tell you one thing - it is for girls, listen to me.

0:06:32.100,0:06:37.900
I was a Christian already and I loved God - this is why I am here delivered now.

0:06:37.900,0:06:46.240
A month ago, when I went to the gym, the nice guys were saying to me, "You are so good, so nice".

0:06:46.240,0:06:50.840
You might think maybe he could be a Christian in the future, your husband or whatever.

0:06:50.840,0:06:56.160
I used to say, "I am a Christian. I can't meet with you."

0:06:56.160,0:07:01.380
When they start to talk with you and have more confidence, they would say,

0:07:01.380,0:07:06.840
"Oh, I would like to read the Bible with you. I would like to know about God. Maybe you could lead me to God?"

0:07:06.840,0:07:11.120
It is a lie!!

0:07:11.120,0:07:15.660
Even before my coming to The SCOAN, there was a man who...

0:07:15.660,0:07:17.460
Thanks God that I didn't sleep with him.

0:07:17.460,0:07:19.440
You know what he told me when I was going home?

0:07:19.440,0:07:25.300
He said, "From now on, you are going to think about me, and you will beg me to call you back,

0:07:25.300,0:07:28.220
and to have sex with me, and to finish what we started."

0:07:28.220,0:07:29.720
That is demon.

0:07:29.720,0:07:36.200
That is not a guy who wants to know the Bible, that's not a Christian and it is not from God!

0:07:36.200,0:07:38.440
Wow, we can really understand how these spirits...

0:07:38.440,0:07:41.460
Let's put our hands together for Jesus

0:07:41.460,0:07:45.760
for rescuing our sister from what could have been a very terrible life indeed.

0:07:45.760,0:07:50.700
Tell us, what were some of the things, that this spirit of flirting has pushed you to do,

0:07:50.700,0:07:55.900
that now, being delivered you find yourself regretting.

0:07:55.900,0:07:58.620
You know, I regret...

0:07:58.620,0:07:59.300
How to say?

0:07:59.300,0:08:01.420
This spirit...

0:08:01.420,0:08:05.420
If I had died, I would have gone to hell.

0:08:05.420,0:08:10.060
That is what I regret most - that I...

0:08:10.060,0:08:10.840
I mean...

0:08:10.840,0:08:19.580
That was the thing: God saved my soul, He saved my spirit because if I had died, I would have gone to hell

0:08:19.580,0:08:23.520
God is holy and He hates sin.

0:08:23.520,0:08:31.500
That is what I regret: doing sin, not being delivered and not fighting with devil harder -

0:08:31.500,0:08:34.120
but it is difficult when you are not delivered.

0:08:34.120,0:08:35.520
OK. We understand.

0:08:35.520,0:08:39.520
Now, for the glory of God - you said you wanted to put devil to shame

0:08:39.520,0:08:42.260
for what he has used you to do in the past;

0:08:42.260,0:08:48.160
tell us some of those worst experiences you had with this spirit of flirting and dog.

0:08:48.160,0:08:54.060
What are the things you want to confess now, in the presence of God?

0:08:54.060,0:08:57.600
Guilt, disgust...

0:08:57.600,0:09:00.800
I had dreams of having sex with men.

0:09:00.800,0:09:07.520
I also had a dream where the man was saying to me, "You are not gonna achieve it. You are nothing.

0:09:07.520,0:09:13.380
You are disgusting. I will take you. You will not achieve what you want to."

0:09:13.380,0:09:16.540
They used to talk to me through the people, even Christians.

0:09:16.540,0:09:23.580
Can you imagine that they told me, "You gonna stay always like that. You will not change."?

0:09:23.580,0:09:27.000
That's how devil was manipulating me.

0:09:27.000,0:09:28.960
That was the worst experience to me.

0:09:28.960,0:09:34.000
Also, I thought that I would never get married because I could not settle.

0:09:34.000,0:09:39.260
I was with a person and I was thinking about doing something with other men.

0:09:39.260,0:09:43.000
I didn't want that but I couldn't deal with it.

0:09:43.000,0:09:46.400
It was just in my mind; it was making me crazy.

0:09:46.400,0:09:47.680
I had a depression.

0:09:47.680,0:09:54.400
I remember - for seven months I used to wake up, go to the bathroom and cry...

0:09:54.400,0:09:56.820
I couldn't even work.

0:09:56.820,0:10:00.300
So, you mean that even when you were in a serious relationship with someone,

0:10:00.300,0:10:02.180
this spirit of flirting would not stop.

0:10:02.180,0:10:04.860
It would still be pushing you to look for other people, even...

0:10:04.860,0:10:05.820
Yes. And I remember...

0:10:05.820,0:10:11.540
For example I was in a serious relationship and I used to blame my ex-boyfriend and say,

0:10:11.540,0:10:16.840
"Don't you want to look at other girls and to do something with them? Because I do."

0:10:16.840,0:10:20.020
I was blaming him.

0:10:20.020,0:10:25.280
I was asking him, "Don't you feel like that? Don't lie. I feel that way."

0:10:25.280,0:10:26.380
I couldn't understand.

0:10:26.380,0:10:30.300
I was feeling that everyone had this kind of feeling.

0:10:30.300,0:10:36.100
When I talked to my mother and said, "I don't know what's happening to me. I feel like going with men to flirt,

0:10:36.100,0:10:39.380
and that was like 'feeding' me, giving me strength.”

0:10:39.380,0:10:42.040
I didn't understand that.

0:10:42.040,0:10:48.620
I even asked Christians what was wrong with me, because I could say "No".

0:10:48.620,0:10:59.960
I wanted to go for a dinner, to get attention - it seemed like it gave me power, confidence, strange feeling to me.

0:10:59.960,0:11:04.860
At the same time, it made you feel like you had power and confidence.

0:11:04.860,0:11:10.680
How did they make you feel about yourself, knowing that you kept having eyes for every man in the room?

0:11:10.680,0:11:13.540
When I wasn't a Christian, that made me to feel cool.

0:11:13.540,0:11:18.660
When I became a Christian, without my conscience, I started to feel guilty and very bad.

0:11:18.660,0:11:21.660
That's how the spiritual battle started.

0:11:21.660,0:11:28.180
When I started to read the Word of God, when Jesus touched my heart, I felt so bad.

0:11:28.180,0:11:31.300
I even thought that God didn't love me.

0:11:31.300,0:11:35.300
Right now, after the deliverance, every time when...

0:11:35.300,0:11:36.420
Because we are human...

0:11:36.420,0:11:39.920
If I had a mind, the thought or something...

0:11:39.920,0:11:48.940
When Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "Jesus loves her", this mind was like a fire to every thought coming to my head.

0:11:48.940,0:11:50.740
It is an incredible feeling.

0:11:50.740,0:11:56.160
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:11:56.160,0:11:58.980
You received your deliverance, as we saw on the screen.

0:11:58.980,0:12:02.340
Tell us what was your experience, when the man of God prayed for you.

0:12:02.340,0:12:05.280
It's incredible.

0:12:05.280,0:12:08.340
I was praying for deliverance a long time ago.

0:12:08.340,0:12:14.260
I went to my church and pastor prayed for me to cast out the demon.

0:12:14.260,0:12:19.080
I didn't know what kind of demon I had, but I knew I had one.

0:12:19.080,0:12:25.720
That's very important to ask God, to reveal if you are delivered or not.

0:12:25.720,0:12:28.020
I knew I was not delivered.

0:12:28.020,0:12:32.760
When other pastors prayed for me I didn't feel anything, and it was like "really?"

0:12:32.760,0:12:38.160
but when T.B. Joshua was praying with the power of God, my body...

0:12:38.160,0:12:42.760
I couldn't handle my body anymore.

0:12:42.760,0:12:45.740
I was loosing the conscience.

0:12:45.740,0:12:50.140
At the same time, my spirit started to feel happy.

0:12:50.140,0:12:55.260
I started to pray with T.B. Joshua saying, "Go out, in the name of Jesus".

0:12:55.260,0:12:57.200
Then the demon manifested.

0:12:57.200,0:13:02.480
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:02.480,0:13:06.320
Now, you have been with us, in the church for another week, since your deliverance.

0:13:06.320,0:13:09.280
Tell us what are the changes you have seen now.

0:13:09.280,0:13:12.780
You know, I could...

0:13:12.780,0:13:20.040
The most important change for me - that's something I would like to maintain, for that I pray to God everyday...

0:13:20.040,0:13:24.420
When I read the Bible it enters my heart.

0:13:24.420,0:13:31.920
Before I used to read the Bible and it was like, "I want to understand but I don't. It doesn't touch me anyhow."

0:13:31.920,0:13:34.960
Right now, I read it and I remember it.

0:13:34.960,0:13:37.260
Can you believe that?

0:13:37.260,0:13:42.800
Hallelujah! Puts your hand together for Jesus!

0:13:42.800,0:13:47.060
What can you say about this spirit of flirting, that you have been delivered from?

0:13:47.060,0:13:52.440
Are you still having the urge, are you still looking around, anytime you move around?

0:13:52.440,0:13:55.980
I can look but I don't feel anything.

0:13:55.980,0:13:58.320
I mean, I'm not gonna be like this, you know.

0:13:58.320,0:14:04.020
I look at the person but I don't have any feeling, like talking or whatever.

0:14:04.020,0:14:06.540
That's a good feeling - yeah!

0:14:06.540,0:14:11.800
Hallelujah! Let's put your hands together for Jesus!

0:14:11.800,0:14:14.140
What a wonderful deliverance.

0:14:14.140,0:14:19.160
Now, that you are free, we want you to tell your word of advice to people watching and listening to you

0:14:19.160,0:14:21.180
all over the world.

0:14:21.180,0:14:24.280
I was praying, "Lord, what could I say to people?"

0:14:24.280,0:14:26.560
That is what came to my head.

0:14:26.560,0:14:31.020
I will read from 1 John 1:6.

0:14:31.020,0:14:42.260
"If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.

0:14:42.260,0:14:48.940
But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another,

0:14:48.940,0:14:53.560
and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin." 1 John 1:6-7

0:14:53.560,0:15:02.640
So, my message would be, "Check your life. Are you walking in the light? Are you a liar?"

0:15:02.640,0:15:05.740
Because I was a liar.

0:15:05.740,0:15:12.460
At some moment I said to God, "God, if I die today, I will go to hell. Help me. Save me."

0:15:12.460,0:15:15.240
Now, I'm here - wooo!

0:15:15.240,0:15:18.100
Thank You, Jesus!

0:15:18.100,0:15:19.020
Amen!

0:15:19.020,0:15:20.100
To God be the glory!

0:15:20.100,0:15:25.460
Lastly, we want you to give a word of advice to women or even men watching you,

0:15:25.460,0:15:29.320
who maybe find themselves having the similar problem of this flirtatious spirit.

0:15:29.320,0:15:31.080
What should they do?

0:15:31.080,0:15:33.420
Well, that worked for me.

0:15:33.420,0:15:40.160
First of all, ask God to reveal... to deliver you.

0:15:40.160,0:15:45.440
Because without deliverance, with the mind or body it's impossible.

0:15:45.440,0:15:49.420
Our flesh cannot defeat satan - it's impossible.

0:15:49.420,0:15:51.360
We need the Holy Spirit.

0:15:51.360,0:15:58.900
First of all, we need to ask God for a deliverance and for the strength to say "No".

0:15:58.900,0:16:01.700
We need to please God, not people!

0:16:01.700,0:16:05.140
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:16:05.140,0:16:10.160
We encourage you sister; you are delivered by the Word of God - make God's Word the standard for your life

0:16:10.160,0:16:14.540
to maintain this deliverance, and the best is yet to come for you, in Jesus' name.

0:16:14.540,0:16:16.360
Thank you, in Jesus name.
