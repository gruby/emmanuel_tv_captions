Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.160,0:00:04.260
Praise the Lord, Church!

0:00:04.260,0:00:07.540
My name is Ogbonna Iwuogbonnaya.

0:00:07.540,0:00:12.460
I am from Abia State, Nigiera, living in Libya.

0:00:12.460,0:00:19.040
My testimony goes like this: I am a gas welder by profession.

0:00:19.040,0:00:23.360
One day, a customer brought me an item to work on in my shop.

0:00:23.360,0:00:32.820
When I started the work, I had already checked to see if the gas was working properly.

0:00:32.820,0:00:37.640
However, immediately when I started working, the gas exploded.

0:00:37.640,0:00:42.000
As it exploded, I didn't know again where I was.

0:00:42.000,0:00:49.080
I was very confused to the extent that I could not open my eyes.

0:00:49.080,0:00:54.620
I called my driver who took me to a private hospital.

0:00:54.620,0:01:05.160
When we reached there, they said they couldn't do anything and directed me to another hospital.

0:01:05.160,0:01:15.680
When I reached there, I met more than five Libyan citizens sitting there with different cases.

0:01:15.680,0:01:21.340
After waiting more than thirty minutes, I told my driver that we had to leave.

0:01:21.340,0:01:28.120
The driver was confused and asked why because he knew I was in severe pain.

0:01:28.120,0:01:34.140
I couldn't even sit down or touch my face because the pain was too much for me.

0:01:34.140,0:01:40.620
I couldn't bear the pain and told my driver that we should go.

0:01:40.620,0:01:45.400
You mean when you were being taken to the first hospital, you were completely rejected?

0:01:45.400,0:01:46.060
Yes.

0:01:46.060,0:01:49.440
Because your face was completely damaged, burnt?

0:01:49.440,0:01:50.189
Exactly.

0:01:50.189,0:01:51.760
And they couldn't attend to you?

0:01:51.760,0:01:52.640
Exactly.

0:01:52.640,0:01:55.180
From there, you were taken to the second hospital?

0:01:55.180,0:01:55.880
Yes.

0:01:55.880,0:01:59.940
When you got there, there were no doctors to attend to your case.

0:01:59.940,0:02:00.920
Exactly.

0:02:00.920,0:02:02.280
So what happened from there?

0:02:02.280,0:02:09.380
From there, I remembered that I had Morning Water in my house; I used to watch Emmanuel TV.

0:02:09.380,0:02:16.280
I had seen God using Prophet T.B. Joshua to heal many people.

0:02:16.280,0:02:20.820
I decided to return to my house.

0:02:20.820,0:02:26.540
The pain was so much that I didn't even know where I was.

0:02:26.540,0:02:31.960
The pain was so severe that I couldn't even touch my face.

0:02:31.960,0:02:36.640
More than five people were fanning me even though I was in an air-conditioned room.

0:02:36.640,0:02:38.840
You mean the burning sensation was so severe?

0:02:38.840,0:02:39.700
So severe.

0:02:39.700,0:02:41.480
That you could not even touch your face?

0:02:41.480,0:02:42.400
Not at all.

0:02:42.400,0:02:43.380
You couldn't even open your eyes?

0:02:43.380,0:02:51.220
I could not open my eyes; I even thought that my eyes had been blinded.

0:02:51.220,0:02:52.300
You thought you were blind?

0:02:52.300,0:02:54.760
I thought I had been blinded.

0:02:54.760,0:03:03.020
When I ministered the Morning Water on my face, immediately my eyes opened!

0:03:03.020,0:03:08.340
I said, "What is this?"

0:03:08.340,0:03:15.220
So, the first time that you ministered the Morning Water on your face, you could open your eyes clearly?

0:03:15.220,0:03:16.340
Is this what you are saying?

0:03:16.340,0:03:24.320
It was when I ministered the Morning Water that I was able to see what had happened to me.

0:03:24.320,0:03:28.600
Immediately after ministering the Morning Water, I took a mirror and looked at myself.

0:03:28.600,0:03:31.760
I said, "Oh God!" I thanked God.

0:03:31.760,0:03:42.000
I continued ministering the Morning Water and gradually, without taking medication,

0:03:42.000,0:03:45.700
my face started healing and the wound drying.

0:03:45.700,0:03:51.600
Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!

0:03:51.600,0:03:53.860
Indeed, we are serving a mighty God.

0:03:53.860,0:03:57.680
We want you to show us - we can see some pictures on the board next to you.

0:03:57.680,0:04:01.920
Can you please tell us what these pictures stand for.

0:04:01.920,0:04:08.080
This is a picture of when the incident happened.

0:04:08.080,0:04:14.040
On the screen of our television, we can see the picture of when the incident took place - when he was affected.

0:04:14.040,0:04:20.580
When I began ministering the Morning Water, my face started peeling, as you can see in this picture.

0:04:20.580,0:04:25.600
So that is when the burnt skin started peeling off, after the ministration of the Morning Water?

0:04:25.600,0:04:26.100
Yes.

0:04:26.100,0:04:33.920
I even thought that my skin would not be smooth again as I had seen others who faced a similar problem

0:04:33.920,0:04:38.040
and they died or their face was condemned.

0:04:38.040,0:04:44.860
To God be the glory, through the Morning Water, the skin on my face became normal.

0:04:44.860,0:04:49.160
I am here now; I am a living testimony!

0:04:49.160,0:04:56.060
I even left my beard to grow because I never thought I would grow a beard again.

0:04:56.060,0:04:58.100
You said what? Please repeat what you said.

0:04:58.100,0:05:05.220
I even left my beard to grow because I never thought I would grow a beard again.

0:05:05.220,0:05:10.500
Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!

0:05:10.500,0:05:19.340
Indeed, we can imagine! How can a beard grown again on a burnt face? - By no means.

0:05:19.340,0:05:22.000
Sir, we want to ask you one more question:

0:05:22.000,0:05:28.540
If not for the medium of the Morning Water, what do you think would have happened to your face

0:05:28.540,0:05:30.800
that we are seeing glowing now?

0:05:30.800,0:05:34.720
I would have had to undergo plastic surgery.

0:05:34.720,0:05:37.440
But to God be the glory, what happened to your face?

0:05:37.440,0:05:43.480
I thank God so much that I'm okay now and strong. Even my hand that was burnt is okay now.

0:05:43.480,0:05:45.120
Everything is completely restored?

0:05:45.120,0:05:45.880
Yes.

0:05:45.880,0:05:52.320
To God be the glory. Let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus!

0:05:52.320,0:05:57.760
What can you now say about this powerful medium of the Morning Water that God Almighty has used

0:05:57.760,0:06:01.920
to restore your skin and to replace it to its original position?

0:06:01.920,0:06:14.780
I used to tell people that God sent the Morning Water through Prophet T.B. Joshua for us to use.

0:06:14.780,0:06:20.560
The Morning Water is something I even find difficult to explain.

0:06:20.560,0:06:29.940
There was a boy who was brought to my house in Libya with stomach pain.

0:06:29.940,0:06:34.880
He couldn't eat; he would immediately vomit anything that entered his mouth.

0:06:34.880,0:06:45.620
But when I ministered the Morning Water to him, he immediately ate biscuits and took a drink.

0:06:45.620,0:06:50.880
Within a small time, he asked for rice - and this was a boy who couldn't eat for three days.

0:06:50.880,0:06:55.020
Anything he put into his mouth before, he would vomit it immediately.

0:06:55.020,0:07:02.440
So, the Morning Water is a great thing God Almighty sent to us through Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:07:02.440,0:07:05.320
To God be the glory! We know we are blessed.

0:07:05.320,0:07:11.680
What advice do you now have for the viewers watching you and those listening to you right now?

0:07:11.680,0:07:13.240
Praise the Lord!

0:07:13.240,0:07:19.760
My advice to viewers, especially those who are watching me in Libya -

0:07:19.760,0:07:34.580
on Sundays we don't have to go to work in Libya and always worship with Emmanuel TV -

0:07:34.580,0:07:42.120
my advice is to believe in God because with Him, all things are possible.

0:07:42.120,0:07:51.360
I did not believe before that I would be like this today but through Emmanuel TV and the Morning Water,

0:07:51.360,0:07:56.160
I am a living testimony today; I thank God.

0:07:56.160,0:07:58.140
Amen.

0:07:58.140,0:08:00.620
Can you please touch your face for the last time?

0:08:00.620,0:08:03.020
You said you were unable to touch your face before.

0:08:03.020,0:08:07.000
Can you please touch your face and tell us if you are still feeling any pain?

0:08:07.000,0:08:09.600
Nothing. No pain. Now I am okay.

0:08:09.600,0:08:10.840
Are you feeling any pain?

0:08:10.840,0:08:12.320
Nothing. I'm alright.

0:08:12.320,0:08:13.620
Everything is fresh?

0:08:13.620,0:08:14.660
Everything is fresh.

0:08:14.660,0:08:16.860
Wholesome, for the glory of God.

0:08:16.860,0:08:21.160
Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!

0:08:21.160,0:08:24.740
We thank God Almighty for this wonderful testimony you have shared with us.

0:08:24.740,0:08:30.220
We believe this has really encouraged us and has lifted up our faith in Christ Jesus.

0:08:30.220,0:08:34.600
We want to encourage you that now that you have been set free, healed for the glory of God,

0:08:34.600,0:08:38.540
continue to live your life to please Jesus Christ, and we pray that He would give you the grace to

0:08:38.540,0:08:42.480
maintain this wonderful healing, in Jesus' mighty name.
