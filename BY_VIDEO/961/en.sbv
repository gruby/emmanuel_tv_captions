Viewers all over the world, we have been on journey of salvation

0:00:05.820,0:00:11.080
I know you have been listening to the message 'the beauty of life'.

0:00:11.080,0:00:17.240
The beauty of life does not depend on how happy we are,

0:00:17.240,0:00:22.980
but on how happy others can be because of us.

0:00:22.980,0:00:26.620
How many people are happy because of you?

0:00:26.620,0:00:31.440
How many lives have you touched today?

0:00:31.440,0:00:36.160
Don't forget somebody needs something you possess.

0:00:36.160,0:00:40.940
It may be your love, it may be your smile with all your heart.

0:00:40.940,0:00:43.080
It may be your money.

0:00:43.080,0:00:45.760
You may say you are poor.

0:00:45.760,0:00:51.960
You may be surprised to see someone who is poorer than you are.

0:00:51.960,0:00:57.180
This means, someone is in need of us.

0:00:57.180,0:01:03.900
No matter how little, how small - someone is in need of us.

0:01:03.900,0:01:09.480
If you cannot part with little, you will not be able to part with much.

0:01:09.480,0:01:14.520
Viewers, the journey of salvation.

0:01:14.520,0:01:23.940
I break all self-will within your heart - be broken in the name of Jesus!

0:01:23.940,0:01:32.600
Every self-will within your heart, be broken in the name of Jesus!

0:01:32.600,0:01:35.440
What you want to do is not what you are doing.

0:01:35.440,0:01:40.300
Every self-will be broken in the name of Jesus.

0:01:40.320,0:01:48.120
Let the will of God be done!

0:01:48.120,0:01:54.440
Viewers, begin to confess those self-wills, fleshly desires,

0:01:54.440,0:02:00.960
those things that come to tempt you, those things you try to resist.

0:02:00.960,0:02:04.080
What you want to do is not what you find yourself doing.

0:02:04.080,0:02:07.700
If that, it is the sin in your life.

0:02:07.700,0:02:09.900
Be broken in the name of Jesus!

0:02:09.900,0:02:13.820
Be disconnected!

Salvation - ready to be delivered.

0:02:21.000,0:02:30.100
I can see you being delivered in the name of Jesus!

0:02:30.100,0:02:34.560
Self-thought, self-will within your heart.

0:02:34.560,0:02:36.600
Faith is of man's heart.

0:02:36.600,0:02:42.240
For the Word of God to dominate your heart, you need to be delivered

0:02:42.240,0:02:46.660
and when you are delivered, you begin to enjoy the Word of God.

0:02:46.660,0:02:51.440
Then, this can influence your character and your conduct.

0:02:51.440,0:02:54.440
You are disconnected in the name of Jesus!

0:02:54.440,0:02:57.200
Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:57.200,0:03:00.400
Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:00.400,0:03:09.640
Let the will of God be done!

More of Your holiness, purity, faithfulness, obedience, in Jesus' name!

0:04:07.200,0:04:10.440

Viewers all over the world, your temple, your body is not its place (affliction, sickness).

0:04:28.520,0:04:39.140
You affliction in their temple - say, "Affliction in my body, I command you out!"

0:04:39.140,0:04:47.500
It can be in your blood - whatever, wherever it is, begin to flush them out!

0:04:47.500,0:04:53.220
In your bones, in your kidneys - I command healing in the name of Jesus!

0:04:53.220,0:04:55.180
In your liver!

0:04:55.180,0:05:08.980
Wherever that affliction, wherever that pain - open your lips and begin to command them out!
