DELIVERANCE TIME

0:00:05.140,0:00:11.040
During the Sunday live service at the SCOAN, Wiseman Christopher ministers prayer

0:00:11.040,0:00:13.960
in the power of the Holy Ghost to the people.

0:00:13.960,0:00:18.780
As he ministers spirit-filled prayer, every chain satan has used to connect the people to himself

0:00:18.780,0:00:21.960
is being disconnected in Jesus' name.

0:00:21.960,0:00:27.400
You can see the reaction of the people as Wiseman Christopher ministers prayer in Jesus' name.

0:00:27.400,0:00:33.580
The demons that are the cause of their problems are being exposed and removed in Jesus' name.

0:00:33.580,0:00:38.440
Get ready to watch what happens when Wiseman Christopher encounters this man.

0:00:38.440,0:00:39.580
Don't come to me!

0:00:39.580,0:00:40.520
Why?

0:00:40.520,0:00:42.700
I don’t want to see a man like you!

0:00:42.700,0:00:44.760
You don’t want to see a man like me?

0:00:44.760,0:00:46.440
I said I'm serious about this!

0:00:46.440,0:00:51.860
Now, bring down your hand.

0:00:51.860,0:00:55.880
We don't carry on missions that we cannot finish.

0:00:55.880,0:00:58.560
I must surely finish what I started.

0:00:58.560,0:00:59.540
Who are you?

0:00:59.540,0:01:03.320
I don’t know if you can do yours.

0:01:03.320,0:01:11.360
What is your mission?

0:01:11.360,0:01:14.740
Follow me.

0:01:14.740,0:01:17.620
You!

0:01:17.620,0:01:22.920
I know who you are!

0:01:22.920,0:01:25.600
This is the time!

0:01:25.600,0:01:26.820
Time to do what?

0:01:26.820,0:01:30.640
I'm going to show you my last power!

0:01:30.640,0:01:34.120
What is the power all about?

0:01:34.120,0:01:36.900
I destroy.

0:01:36.900,0:01:39.420
I kill.

0:01:39.420,0:01:42.460
I fornicate.

0:01:42.460,0:01:46.760
I disturb the peace of the people.

0:01:46.760,0:01:50.580
Nobody ever questioned me. How dare you?!

0:01:50.580,0:01:53.800
Let me tell you what you don't know.

0:01:53.800,0:01:57.140
This one is our own.

0:01:57.140,0:01:58.940
Which one?

0:01:58.940,0:02:02.400
We have destroyed so many of them.

0:02:02.400,0:02:05.820
But the Lord wants to save this one.

0:02:05.820,0:02:10.280
He cannot!

0:02:10.280,0:02:19.560
I knew that a day like this would come, when I would meet you one on one.

0:02:19.560,0:02:22.380
What other evil have you done?

0:02:22.380,0:02:27.680
We don’t and we can never work like children!

0:02:27.680,0:02:29.760
We are matured in the realm.

0:02:29.760,0:02:31.000
Which realm?

0:02:31.000,0:02:32.500
You don’t know?

0:02:32.500,0:02:34.540
You want to tell me you don’t know?

0:02:34.540,0:02:38.200
Jesus knows.

0:02:38.200,0:02:40.520
The name we don’t want to hear.

0:02:40.520,0:02:42.340
Get out!

0:02:42.340,0:02:43.560
Why?

0:02:43.560,0:02:47.440
You said you don’t want to hear the name of Jesus, why?

0:02:47.440,0:02:49.100
See!

0:02:49.100,0:02:51.100
You may be holding me

0:02:51.100,0:02:54.440
but let me tell you, you are not as strong as this man!

0:02:54.440,0:02:56.340
Stop that!

0:02:56.340,0:02:59.080
Stop that and answer me, you demon.

0:02:59.080,0:03:05.360
What is the evil you have done?

0:03:05.360,0:03:08.200
How did you enter this man's body?

0:03:08.200,0:03:09.460
Through many ways!

0:03:09.460,0:03:10.620
Like what?

0:03:10.620,0:03:11.980
In the dream!

0:03:11.980,0:03:21.240
We fed him many years ago in his dreams!

0:03:21.240,0:03:25.620
He is married to a wife in the spirit.

0:03:25.620,0:03:30.460
Do you think that you can take the wife away from him?

0:03:30.460,0:03:36.560
Though his future is bright, I don’t know if you can do that!

0:03:36.560,0:03:41.940
If you think you can, let's get to the battleground!

0:03:41.940,0:03:43.560
What other evil have you done?

0:03:43.560,0:03:45.100
Don't frustrate me!

0:03:45.100,0:03:47.560
I told you!

0:03:47.560,0:03:50.900
Or, you think I'm joking with you?

0:03:50.900,0:03:53.660
I know you are a man of God

0:03:53.660,0:03:56.920
but the power...

0:03:56.920,0:04:07.160
My last power – I will use it to fight the last battle, if this is the one.

0:04:07.160,0:04:10.600
What do you mean by the last battle?

0:04:10.600,0:04:13.020
The last mission in my life.

0:04:13.020,0:04:22.680
If I don’t destroy him, then the victory is yours.

0:04:22.680,0:04:27.920
How do you want to go about destroying him?

0:04:27.920,0:04:29.540
I know the family background.

0:04:29.540,0:04:30.760
What have you done to the family?

0:04:30.760,0:04:34.860
I know what they did in the family, before they gave birth to him.

0:04:34.860,0:04:38.740
They would have killed the mother

0:04:38.740,0:04:44.640
but God loves the mother and the son.

0:04:44.640,0:04:49.020
Both the parents are dead and the son will not live.

0:04:49.020,0:04:52.280
What did you do to the family?

0:04:52.280,0:04:54.780
Go and ask them in the village!

0:04:54.780,0:04:57.400
We almost finished the family!

0:04:57.400,0:05:03.500
The family is a family of ten, but it is only four that survived.

0:05:03.500,0:05:04.960
What happened to the other six?

0:05:04.960,0:05:10.200
Don’t question me, I told you!

0:05:10.200,0:05:12.720
How dare you to question a man like me?!

0:05:12.720,0:05:15.780
I said I'm strong in the realm.

0:05:15.780,0:05:20.860
That's why you see me today.

0:05:20.860,0:05:24.980
Let's get to the battleground!

0:05:24.980,0:05:27.820
I know you are one of the heads.

0:05:27.820,0:05:29.880
Are you not?

0:05:29.880,0:05:34.340
You want me to tell you all about you?

0:05:34.340,0:05:39.280
I'm just waiting for the last bell to ring, then the battle will begin.

0:05:39.280,0:05:42.300
What do you mean by the battle?

0:05:42.300,0:05:45.740
You cannot just cast a spirit out of a human without a fight.

0:05:45.740,0:05:48.760
It is a struggle!

0:05:48.760,0:05:52.280
Let's make it 50/50.

0:05:52.280,0:05:53.640
Do you know what I mean by that?

0:05:53.640,0:05:56.340
Go ahead and explain.

0:05:56.340,0:06:02.260
One of your body parts will be destroyed for you to save this one.

0:06:02.260,0:06:04.320
You think I'm joking, right?

0:06:04.320,0:06:06.340
Are you now ready for the battle?

0:06:06.340,0:06:07.800
Of course, yes!

0:06:07.800,0:06:10.940
Are you strong enough to withstand me? Then let's try it!

0:06:10.940,0:06:19.620
The battle for survival is not a personal challenge, but one against Jesus.

0:06:19.620,0:06:20.720
Are you ready?

0:06:20.720,0:06:22.080
Don't fight with me, please!

0:06:22.080,0:06:23.460
You said what?

0:06:23.460,0:06:32.080
I will call he who is stronger than me to fight you, right now!

0:06:32.080,0:06:35.280
Are you now ready to fight?

0:06:35.280,0:06:36.420
Yes, I am.

0:06:36.420,0:06:43.580
Can you stand right and get ready? Position yourself!

0:06:47.860,0:06:51.560
Get ready. Is there any other thing you need to do?

0:06:51.560,0:06:54.920
Are you getting ready?

0:06:54.920,0:06:57.420
I command fire from Heaven.

0:06:57.420,0:07:01.860
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:01.860,0:07:06.020
Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:06.020,0:07:08.640
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:08.640,0:07:10.920
Come out, you demon!

0:07:10.920,0:07:12.340
Out!

0:07:12.340,0:07:14.520
Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:14.520,0:07:15.680
Fire in the name of Jesus!

0:07:15.680,0:07:20.260
Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:20.260,0:07:21.960
Fire!

0:07:21.960,0:07:24.140
Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:24.140,0:07:24.760
Help me!

0:07:24.760,0:07:33.840
Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:33.840,0:07:35.920
No hiding place!

0:07:35.920,0:07:41.380
You cannot go beyond the Word of God, come back!

0:07:41.380,0:07:44.980
Come back here in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:44.980,0:07:48.700
Come!

0:07:48.700,0:07:49.780
Didn’t I tell you?

0:07:49.780,0:07:51.380
Come!

0:07:51.380,0:07:57.280
It would be 50/50 today!

0:07:57.280,0:08:00.840
Now, stop!

0:08:00.840,0:08:07.120
Are you still ready to fight?

0:08:11.000,0:08:12.320
Stop!

0:08:12.320,0:08:18.580
Come back, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:18.580,0:08:22.400
At the count of three!

0:08:22.400,0:08:23.360
Didn’t I tell you?

0:08:23.360,0:08:26.440
Are you ready to lose one of your hands for him to be free?

0:08:26.440,0:08:27.720
Stop there!

0:08:27.720,0:08:28.920
I stopped.

0:08:28.920,0:08:34.700
That means I have surrendered but I can't just surrender.

0:08:34.700,0:08:39.660
I want to see more of your power.

0:08:39.660,0:08:42.920
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:42.920,0:08:44.440
Come out, in the name of Jesus!

0:08:44.440,0:08:47.740
Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:53.440,0:09:00.560
At the mention of the name "Jesus Christ" all knees shall bow.

0:09:01.540,0:09:03.740
Now go.

0:09:03.740,0:09:06.760
No!

0:09:06.760,0:09:11.340
What can I do for you to allow me? |

0:09:11.340,0:09:12.460
Go.

0:09:12.460,0:09:19.160
No, because we don’t have anywhere to go.

0:09:19.160,0:09:21.060
I command you to go.

0:09:21.060,0:09:28.560
Move.

0:09:28.560,0:09:31.220
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:09:40.640,0:09:43.160
Move.

0:09:43.160,0:09:47.820
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:09:47.820,0:09:51.040
Stop!

0:09:53.580,0:09:55.140
Where are you going?

0:09:55.140,0:09:57.820
Come back.

0:09:57.820,0:09:59.580
Come back here.

0:10:02.420,0:10:10.720
Allow me to be myself, but until the shoes are removed…

0:10:10.720,0:10:13.580
Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:13.580,0:10:18.080
Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:18.080,0:10:21.840
Out!

0:10:21.840,0:10:24.360
Pity me, please.

0:10:24.360,0:10:26.600
Go back to where you are coming from.

0:10:26.600,0:10:29.500
But this is the only home I have.

0:10:29.500,0:10:32.580
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:32.580,0:10:34.100
Come out of him.

0:10:34.100,0:10:36.960
Come back here!

0:10:36.960,0:10:38.940
Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:10:38.940,0:10:41.300
Fire!

0:10:54.280,0:10:55.460
What did you say?

0:10:55.460,0:10:57.420
What is happening now?

0:10:57.420,0:10:59.380
Where am I?

0:10:59.380,0:11:03.240
Tell me please!

0:11:03.240,0:11:05.520
Come here!

0:11:05.520,0:11:07.240
The Lord has set you free; relax.

0:11:07.240,0:11:09.740
Are you sure? Am I safe?

0:11:09.740,0:11:10.740
What is this?

0:11:10.740,0:11:11.820
Calm down.

0:11:11.820,0:11:16.260
What is happening here? Look at my clothes.

0:11:16.260,0:11:18.240
You said you were a demon.

0:11:18.240,0:11:20.960
That you possessed this body.

0:11:20.960,0:11:25.660
And you had a mission and your mission was in three categories -

0:11:25.660,0:11:29.140
to kill, to steal and to destroy.

0:11:29.140,0:11:29.740
No.

0:11:29.740,0:11:35.680
You destroyed a lot of people and you wanted to kill this brother.

0:11:35.680,0:11:40.860
They had ten people in the family and you succeeded in killing six;

0:11:40.860,0:11:42.820
only four remain now.

0:11:42.820,0:11:49.180
I only knew that there were a lot of problems in my family.

0:11:49.180,0:11:51.820
Almost all of my brothers are dead.

0:11:51.820,0:11:53.100
My parents are dead.

0:11:53.100,0:12:00.100
Even me, nothing is in place at all.

0:12:00.100,0:12:04.360
Sometimes, I think I should go drink poison and die.

0:12:04.360,0:12:06.640
There was a day, I was watching Emmanuel TV,

0:12:06.640,0:12:11.360
people were receiving miracles, in a restaurant where I went to eat.

0:12:11.360,0:12:15.600
I thought that one day I would visit the church and God would help me.

0:12:15.600,0:12:17.820
And here you are. Lord has cast out...

0:12:17.820,0:12:23.900
Praise the Lord!

0:12:23.900,0:12:28.720
Thank You, Jesus!

0:12:28.720,0:12:30.460
I know I'm free!

0:12:30.460,0:12:31.820
I am free!

0:12:31.820,0:12:35.040
Thank You, Jesus! I am free!

0:12:35.040,0:12:39.320
In Jesus' name, I am free forever!
