0:00:00.000,0:00:02.660
Hallelujah!

0:00:02.660,0:00:06.660
Happy Easter!

0:00:06.660,0:00:11.420
Viewers all over the world,

0:00:11.420,0:00:15.260
that is the language everywhere - Happy Easter!

0:00:15.260,0:00:22.440
I need to use a language you understand. But today, we are going to talk about that revelation.

0:00:22.440,0:00:28.160
For the name Jesus is revelation and the message too is revelation.

0:00:28.160,0:00:35.720
Even faith is made known by divine revelation.

0:00:35.720,0:00:41.780
And even I'm here today - if you are not looking at me through revelation,

0:00:41.780,0:00:48.200
you continue to see T.B. Joshua, that your brother that has white hair here.

0:00:48.200,0:00:51.140
You may be seated. Thank you

0:00:51.140,0:00:53.460
Hallelujah!

0:00:53.460,0:00:55.460
Yes

0:00:55.460,0:00:59.840
You are not here to see the man.

0:00:59.840,0:01:06.040
You are here by revelation to see a man called Prophet,

0:01:06.040,0:01:10.420
not a man called T.B. Joshua.

0:01:10.420,0:01:12.700
Hallelujah!

0:01:12.700,0:01:18.580
T.B. Joshua is your brother. There is a man you need to know by revelation.

0:01:18.580,0:01:20.540
That is divine nature.

0:01:20.540,0:01:23.480
Hallelujah!

0:01:23.480,0:01:30.060
Ok, let's quickly look at the book of 1 Corinthians 12, the name Jesus.

0:01:30.060,0:01:32.780
Hallelujah!

0:01:32.780,0:01:36.500
1 Corinthians 12:3:

0:01:36.500,0:01:45.460
"Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says,

0:01:45.460,0:01:54.860
'Jesus be cursed', and no one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the help of the Holy Ghost."

0:01:54.860,0:02:02.760
You can say "Jesus." It means you cannot just wake up and say "Jesus" without being led.

0:02:02.760,0:02:10.100
Because you hear people say "Jesus" and you say "Jesus" - you are calling your brother at home.

0:02:10.100,0:02:15.960
I was watching a game yesterday; I saw a guy named Jesus.

0:02:15.960,0:02:20.480
And the referee would say "Jesus, Jesus!" and I would say, "What Jesus?"

0:02:20.480,0:02:26.460
On the field. That was yesterday, I saw a guy who was playing football - number 7.

0:02:26.460,0:02:33.100
His name is Jesus. I said, "Aha! So this is the name some of our people used to call".

0:02:33.100,0:02:37.080
And the man cannot help them.

0:02:37.080,0:02:45.360
But the Jesus of Nazareth can be revealed to you by revelation.

0:02:45.360,0:02:48.980
You must be led by the Spirit to that Jesus -

0:02:48.980,0:02:55.720
not to the name of your brother, but to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

0:02:55.720,0:02:58.940
Hallelujah!

0:02:58.940,0:03:07.360
Let's read together again. 1 Corinthians 12:3:

0:03:07.360,0:03:14.600
"Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says..."

0:03:14.600,0:03:22.760
But if you call the name Jesus by the help of the Spirit, you will not call your brother at home.

0:03:22.760,0:03:29.100
...no one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the Holy Ghost."

0:03:29.100,0:03:32.600
That is, Holy Spirit. The name Jesus must be revealed to you.

0:03:32.600,0:03:37.960
No one can say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit, by the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:03:37.960,0:03:42.980
What does that mean? Your God is not a human being.

0:03:42.980,0:03:50.420
Because He came from where? To do what?

0:03:50.420,0:03:53.159
Because we say "Happy Easter", what is the meaning of Easter?

0:03:53.160,0:04:01.040
What do mean? Whom are we celebrating? Is it your brother or someone you know somewhere?

0:04:01.040,0:04:09.420
You know revelation brings conviction. And conviction brings real movement.

0:04:09.420,0:04:12.880
When we say real movement, we mean, power steps.

0:04:12.880,0:04:19.480
The moment you say, "I am a Christian", you talk of power. You can't separate Christianity from power.

0:04:19.480,0:04:22.780
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:04:22.780,0:04:35.100
Real movement means power steps - steps with intent, purpose.

0:04:35.100,0:04:47.640
Revelation is the realisation of something previously not known.

0:04:47.640,0:04:52.620
"Hey, Jesus Christ!" - in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:04:52.620,0:04:58.320
Like we are going to see today. We are going to see Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost

0:04:58.320,0:05:01.500
and it will be revealed to you in the Spirit.

0:05:01.500,0:05:03.880
Healing is a relation.

0:05:03.880,0:05:07.400
Deliverance is a revelation.

0:05:07.400,0:05:10.300
Salvation is a revelation.

0:05:10.300,0:05:16.260
He said: "Be healed!" You just see people begin to, "What is happening here?"

0:05:16.260,0:05:25.020
Just because I said to you that studying the Bible is good for you,

0:05:25.020,0:05:32.480
that does not mean that I can get you to believe that studying the Bible is good for you.

0:05:32.480,0:05:41.920
You must get that revelation in order to believe.

0:05:41.920,0:05:48.300
That is, I had the revelation that studying the Bible is good for you.

0:05:48.300,0:05:58.100
That does not mean that I can get you to believe that studying the Bible is good for you.

0:05:58.100,0:06:06.680
You must get that revelation in order to believe.

0:06:06.680,0:06:18.380
The challenges we have now is that we are too conditioned into believing

0:06:18.380,0:06:22.560
that what we are reading in the Bible is for people in the Bible.

0:06:22.560,0:06:27.900
When you remember your weakness, your fault, your pitfall,

0:06:27.900,0:06:34.820
you say,  "'Son of David, have mercy on me', that is for the blind Bartholomew".

0:06:34.820,0:06:42.840
You blind today, when you remember your weakness, pitfall, sin,

0:06:42.840,0:06:50.460
you say,  "No, that cannot work for me. That is for the man".

0:06:50.460,0:07:04.680
We are too conditioned into believing that what God said can happen to others

0:07:04.680,0:07:06.740
will not happen to you.

0:07:06.740,0:07:09.580
That is just the sense.

0:07:09.580,0:07:16.940
What God says can happen to others will not happen to you - that is the condition.

0:07:16.940,0:07:27.560
We look at all of our weaknesses, sins, pitfalls, faults and say,

0:07:27.560,0:07:34.020
"It is not going to happen to me because of my sin".

0:07:34.020,0:07:41.540
Remember the message I gave last Sunday.

0:07:41.540,0:07:49.620
Success, greatness is not about your weakness, fault, pitfall.

0:07:49.620,0:08:04.620
It is about what Jesus did for us at the cross.

0:08:04.620,0:08:12.020
He made us fit for God.

0:08:12.020,0:08:14.320
He made us what?

0:08:14.320,0:08:17.580
Fit! This is what we are talking about today.

0:08:17.580,0:08:23.820
Fitness means, your past is over;

0:08:23.820,0:08:27.800
your sin has been forgiven.

0:08:27.800,0:08:32.980
If your sin has been forgiven, what follows?

0:08:32.980,0:08:36.500
He made you fit for God.

0:08:36.500,0:08:44.880
Tell your neighbor, "Happy Easter! Jesus made you fit for God!"

0:08:44.880,0:08:46.780
I canÂ´t hear you.

0:08:46.780,0:08:51.480
Happy Easter! Jesus made you fit for God!

0:08:51.480,0:09:02.240
You are a work of art.

0:09:02.240,0:09:08.500
If you want to become God's person, follow His process.

0:09:08.500,0:09:15.380
Tell your neighbour,  "If you want to become God's person, follow His process".

0:09:15.380,0:09:16.520
I can't hear you.

0:09:16.520,0:09:20.240
"If you want to become God's person, follow His process."

0:09:20.240,0:09:21.160
Again.

0:09:21.160,0:09:24.580
"If you want to become God's person, follow His process."

0:09:24.580,0:09:29.160
That is that. That's like you take a pen.

0:09:29.160,0:09:31.940
You just begin to draw.

0:09:31.940,0:09:36.320
You put hair, you put hand, you put that - you want to put on the picture of T.B. Joshua.

0:09:36.320,0:09:38.720
You know where you have to start from.

0:09:38.720,0:09:40.720
You say, This is leg, this is hand.

0:09:40.720,0:09:44.640
You are a work of art.

0:09:44.640,0:09:53.660
If you want to become God's person, follow His process.

0:09:53.660,0:10:25.240
All the way to Calvary He went for me

0:10:25.240,0:10:38.240
He went to set me free

0:10:38.240,0:10:52.060
For you to be here today and join us to celebrate Easter, God prepared you.

0:10:52.060,0:10:56.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:56.720,0:11:07.620
Tell your neightbour, "God prepared me in advance".

0:11:07.620,0:11:16.560
Tell your neighbour again, "For me to be here today, God prepared me in advance

0:11:16.560,0:11:23.220
before putting me in the fire of life".

0:11:23.220,0:11:31.840
He was there before Daniel in the lion's den. That is why the lions turned to friends.

0:11:31.840,0:11:40.740
That is why the fire turned to ice because He was there.

0:11:40.740,0:11:50.820
God is trying to build character now so that when you get to the place of destiny,

0:11:50.820,0:11:56.720
you will not crash, explode and lose it all.

0:11:56.720,0:12:02.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:02.640,0:12:06.940
Are you with me?

0:12:06.940,0:12:10.760
Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:12:10.760,0:12:11.900
Tell your neighbour.

0:12:11.900,0:12:14.400
"Nothing good happens without discipline."

0:12:14.400,0:12:15.480
I can't hear you.

0:12:15.480,0:12:17.780
"Nothing good happens without discipline."

0:12:17.780,0:12:18.560
Again

0:12:18.560,0:12:21.080
"Nothing good happens without discipline."

0:12:21.080,0:12:22.460
Again and again.

0:12:22.460,0:12:24.720
"Nothing good happens without discipline."

0:12:24.720,0:12:28.380
If you count many things that happened to you, that you are not satisfied,

0:12:28.380,0:12:35.240
that you are not happy with, you will know you were not disciplined when all this happened.

0:12:35.240,0:12:38.520
They came when you were out of discipline.

0:12:38.520,0:12:41.740
Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:12:41.740,0:12:46.680
You talk of sickness, you talk of this, you talk of that.

0:12:46.680,0:12:51.160
Any time you are disciplined, what follows? Good.

0:12:51.160,0:12:55.420
Any time you are not disciplined, what follows? Bad.

0:12:55.420,0:12:59.580
Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:12:59.580,0:13:03.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:03.580,0:13:09.080
Happy Easter!

0:13:09.080,0:13:19.980
Tell your neighbour, "Nothing good happens without discipline".

0:13:19.980,0:13:31.840
Becoming rich and influential without the right character is all type.

0:13:31.840,0:13:36.360
It is out of balance.

0:13:36.360,0:13:46.820
Jesus does not want us to succeed financially and lose our kids, children to drugs

0:13:46.820,0:13:53.500
and lose our children to militants and lose our children to the world.

0:13:53.500,0:14:00.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:00.520,0:14:07.620
Pick that word and take it home before you begin to celebrate. Go and put your home in order.

0:14:07.620,0:14:11.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:11.960,0:14:17.940
Sometimes you say, "I run after business... Look at my friend".

0:14:17.940,0:14:22.920
You want to be a Christian? Look at your children. What are you doing with them?

0:14:22.920,0:14:28.200
You want to be great and abandon them to drugs. You want to be great and allow them to be in the world.

0:14:28.200,0:14:32.740
You can never be great in the Lord.

0:14:32.740,0:15:00.180
All the way to Calvary He went for me

0:15:00.180,0:15:08.620
He went to set me free

0:15:08.620,0:15:19.640
Becoming rich and influential without the right character is all type.

0:15:19.640,0:15:23.280
It is out of balance.

0:15:23.280,0:15:28.020
The children, they are part of your blessing.

0:15:28.020,0:15:35.420
If one is faulty, all are faulty. If one is bad, all are bad.

0:15:35.420,0:15:38.660
There is no shortcut.

0:15:38.660,0:15:53.740
Life is a marathon, not a sprint - no shortcuts.

0:15:53.740,0:15:58.700
We want to use a shortcut.

0:15:58.700,0:16:00.840
You see the world today.

0:16:00.840,0:16:06.280
When you see many general managers, these are the people who cannot manage their homes.

0:16:06.280,0:16:11.120
Many heads of parastatals cannot manage their homes.

0:16:11.120,0:16:23.980
Many want to own their own company, and they cannot keep their own car clean.

0:16:23.980,0:16:27.820
What kind of company do you expect from people like that?

0:16:27.820,0:16:37.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:37.980,0:16:48.620
Many want to get married because of their age but they cannot keep their pet at home.

0:16:48.620,0:16:58.500
They cannot manage their pet at home but they want to get married because of their age.

0:16:58.500,0:17:04.760
This is what turns the whole world upside down today.

0:17:04.760,0:17:13.040
You that cannot keep your car clean, you want to own your own company.

0:17:13.040,0:17:20.300
You cannot manage your home but you are the head of big, different companies.

0:17:20.300,0:17:22.300
MD of the companies.

0:17:22.300,0:17:25.980
What can you expect from such a company?

0:17:25.980,0:17:27.880
Charity begins at home.

0:17:27.880,0:17:34.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:34.380,0:17:38.360
Happy Easter!

0:17:38.360,0:17:42.380
Jesus was able to manage His team.

0:17:42.380,0:17:51.800
That is why He paid the supreme price wee are here today to celebrate.

0:17:51.800,0:18:01.800
Jesus does not want any one of us to end our days saying,

0:18:01.800,0:18:06.520
"I should have been, I would have been, I could have been".

0:18:06.520,0:18:08.460

0:18:08.460,0:18:15.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:15.640,0:18:23.680
Tell your neighbour, "JesÃºs does not want us to end our days saying,

'I could have been, I should have been, I would have been'".

We are here today.

0:18:39.780,0:18:42.760
Your kid is at home; your children are at home.

0:18:42.760,0:18:47.500
You can't say, "Let us go!" They will tell you, "What are you celebrating?"

0:18:50.420,0:19:03.700
But you are the leader, controller, instructor, commander of other children.

0:19:03.700,0:19:12.900
We want to use shortcuts.

0:19:12.900,0:19:23.540
Life is a marathon.

0:19:23.540,0:19:29.120
You want to be God's person - follow His process.

Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:19:38.960,0:19:41.240
Nothing good happens without what?

0:19:41.240,0:19:44.240
Discipline!

0:19:44.240,0:19:55.400
This is whyJesus is trying to build character now so that when you get to the place of your destiny,

0:19:55.400,0:19:59.720
you will not crash, explode and lose it all.

0:19:59.720,0:20:05.760
Many lose it all today. You see the world - going up and losing it all.

0:20:05.760,0:20:17.600
Greatness - lose it all. Popularity, fame - lose it all because we are not following the process.

0:20:17.600,0:20:24.000
Tell your neighbour, "I know why I'm going through what I'm going through.

0:20:24.000,0:20:29.260
God is busy building character".

0:20:29.260,0:20:34.040
Yes, that character will help you.

0:20:34.040,0:20:45.800
When you are at the place of your destiny, it will help you to sustain, to stand the challenges of time.

0:20:45.800,0:20:49.840
You say, "Ah! My business is not going well! Why is my business like this?

0:20:49.840,0:20:53.540
Why do I not have a job? What's wrong?

0:20:53.540,0:20:58.260
I'm sick. I am a Christian".

0:20:58.260,0:21:01.260
Ask God for the reason.

0:21:01.260,0:21:07.440
It may be that God is busy building character.

0:21:07.440,0:21:14.120
Say after me, "God is trying to build character NOW!".

0:21:14.120,0:21:15.120
I canÂ´t hear you.

0:21:15.240,0:21:18.400
God is trying to build character NOW!

0:21:18.400,0:21:24.760
That NOW should be in a capital form - Capital N, Capital O, Capital W.

0:21:24.760,0:21:29.500
God is trying to build character NOW!

0:21:29.500,0:21:37.540
If you don't get that character NOW, whatever you achieve, you will likely lose it!

0:21:37.540,0:21:40.760
Character is a tonic.

0:21:40.760,0:21:50.240
There's nothing you can keep for a while, for long, without character.

0:21:50.240,0:21:53.420
Character is the oil in the lamp.

0:21:53.420,0:21:59.900
Whatever you achieve is that flame. The light that is burning; but the oil in the lamp is character.

0:21:59.900,0:22:04.120
And if there is no oil in the lamp, what will happen to the lamp?

0:22:04.120,0:22:06.680
It will be off!

0:22:06.680,0:22:08.420
One thing off!

0:22:08.420,0:22:10.420
One, one, one, one!

0:22:10.420,0:22:12.840
Influence will be off!

0:22:12.840,0:22:15.100
The glory will be off!

0:22:15.100,0:22:19.560
Popularity will be off! They say, "Where is this man? They can't hear of him again!"

0:22:19.560,0:22:28.000
The oil is dry - that is character.

0:22:28.000,0:22:29.880
Are you with me?

0:22:29.880,0:22:33.260
The oil in the lamp is character.

0:22:33.260,0:22:36.600
The lamp light is what?

0:22:36.600,0:22:38.860
Proceeds.

0:22:38.860,0:22:48.860
Proceeds could be money, fame, popularity, this, that, president, minister, senate.

0:22:48.860,0:22:55.240
These are proceeds, but the oil inside the lamp is character.

0:22:55.240,0:23:01.760
And when the oil dries, all the proceeds will soon...

0:23:01.760,0:23:12.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:12.580,0:23:16.040
If I were you, just put a lamp on your altar.

0:23:16.040,0:23:19.180
I know you have everything you need.

0:23:19.180,0:23:25.080
Electricity is there but electricity apart, put a lamp on your table.

0:23:25.080,0:23:30.820
It is a symbol that the light there is proceeds.

0:23:30.820,0:23:34.740
The oil inside the lamp is character.

0:23:34.740,0:23:41.680
Any time you fail to put oil and you try, you see the light off.

0:23:41.680,0:23:50.860
That is your life. When you put a lamp on your altar, it's a symbol of you. You are that lamp.

0:23:50.860,0:23:56.480
If you look at my altar, you see a lamp there. There is electricity. People say,  "Why that lamp?"

0:23:56.480,0:24:00.880
Yes, it is a symbol.

0:24:00.880,0:24:08.720
When the oil is gradually drying, you see a kind of dim light.

0:24:08.720,0:24:12.860
That is, you are not able to identify anything with that dim light.

0:24:12.860,0:24:15.720
This is the life of many of us today.

0:24:15.720,0:24:20.860
Your proceeds are not enough. It's causing you trouble.

0:24:20.860,0:24:28.560
Where you are supposed to give 1 million naira, 1 million dollar, you are given 5000 naira.

0:24:28.560,0:24:31.220
What is not done well, is not done at all.

0:24:31.220,0:24:33.640
They have given you a name.

0:24:33.640,0:24:41.240
You don't know what to do again because what you have is no longer enough because the oil is drying.

0:24:41.240,0:24:47.420
We are talking of dividends of Easter

0:24:47.420,0:24:51.500
What is Easter?

0:24:51.500,0:25:02.320
He went for you to make you fit, to make you qualified,

0:25:02.320,0:25:09.720
to make you a friend of God, to make you dine and wine with God.

0:25:09.720,0:25:15.660
You can still reinstate your way and put things right.

0:25:15.660,0:25:19.860
Those of you that know that you cannot even manage the little home you have

0:25:19.860,0:25:23.740
but you are the head of companies,

0:25:23.740,0:25:30.420
you can still look back because you'll soon lose it all.

0:25:30.420,0:25:38.820
You have money, influence and you have lost your kid, your children to drugs,

0:25:38.820,0:25:43.820
militants, the world - you can still look back.

0:25:43.820,0:25:47.980
It is not too late to carry them along.

0:25:47.980,0:25:51.960
What is right is right;  what is not right is not right.

0:25:51.960,0:26:05.340
Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:26:05.340,0:26:16.340
We look at all our weaknesses, faults and say,

0:26:16.340,0:26:21.240
"It is not going to happen to me - what happened to others".

0:26:21.240,0:26:33.560
What happens in the name of God is not about your weakness, pitfalls, faults;

0:26:33.560,0:26:47.100
It is about what Jesus achieved, did for us.

0:26:47.100,0:26:50.720
He made you qualified.

0:26:50.720,0:26:55.720
I say, it can happen to you, in the name of Jesus!

0:26:55.720,0:27:01.000
If satan wants to rob you of your blessings, he will say to you,

0:27:01.000,0:27:02.920
"Because of your weakness!"

0:27:02.920,0:27:06.520
He will immediately remind you of your weakness, your faults.

0:27:06.520,0:27:10.960
And when that begins to come into your heart, you know it is the work of satan.

0:27:10.960,0:27:14.460
You know you came from home.

0:27:14.460,0:27:21.780
Many of you through flight - you know it's fire of life to fly on the air.

0:27:21.780,0:27:28.020
Human being pilots - he may be a drunkard, smoker.

0:27:28.020,0:27:31.560
But that is fire of life.

0:27:31.560,0:27:40.400
If God has not prepared you in advance, you will not be able to skip through.

0:27:40.400,0:27:44.500
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:27:44.500,0:28:01.760
Say, "He prepared me in advance before putting me inside the aircraft, train, vehicle to here".

0:28:01.760,0:28:06.260
Overflow Congregation

0:28:06.260,0:28:15.060
If God had not prepared you, it would have been very easy for your enemy to get you.

0:28:15.060,0:28:17.320
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:28:17.320,0:28:23.780
From one flight to stopover, sleeping, joining another flight,

0:28:23.780,0:28:29.160
back, entering a car - oh my God!

0:28:29.160,0:28:35.520
He had prepared you in advance before putting you...

0:28:35.520,0:28:52.240
Say, "He had prepared me in advance before putting me in the fire of life".

0:28:52.240,0:28:56.160
You can say to your neighbour,  "Happy Easter!"

0:28:56.160,0:29:04.520
Jesus of Nazareth must built character

0:29:04.520,0:29:13.060
so that when you get to the place of your destiny, you will not crash.

0:29:13.060,0:29:17.420
Now, here is character.

0:29:17.420,0:29:19.640
Happy Easter!

0:29:19.640,0:29:20.840
Answer me.

0:29:20.840,0:29:22.440
Happy Easter!

0:29:22.440,0:29:31.000
You know I told you that the Word becomes part of us by meditation.

0:29:31.000,0:29:34.940
The Word of God becomes part of you by what? - Meditation.

0:29:34.940,0:29:36.660
See.

0:29:36.660,0:29:39.720
Sometimes when I'm alone, I continue to fire on.

0:29:39.720,0:29:42.720
I told you I watched a game yesterday - football.

0:29:42.720,0:29:48.340
I have time; itÂ´s not a sin. I was just sitting there and watching while this one was in my hand.

0:29:48.340,0:29:50.980
I saw that number 7.

0:29:50.980,0:29:56.200
"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!" - I said, "Which Jesus are they calling?"

0:29:56.200,0:29:59.060
He was about to score. They said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, go, go!"

0:29:59.060,0:30:01.900
I said, "Ah! This one is not Jesus; he cannot score".

0:30:01.900,0:30:06.840
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:30:06.840,0:30:08.480
Hallelujah!

0:30:08.480,0:30:13.280
Can I hear your lesson and the message you are taking home this Easter?

0:30:13.280,0:30:16.000
Come on. Someone there.

0:30:16.000,0:30:18.660
Tell me about your children now.

0:30:18.660,0:30:27.220
Jesus does not want you to succeed and lose your kid to drugs.

0:30:27.220,0:30:33.860
Jesus does not want me to succeed and lose my kids, so thereby I must work on my character

0:30:33.860,0:30:39.020
and my children - I must work on their spiritual life.

0:30:39.020,0:30:42.940
You can see that IÂ´m drawing very close to you because I like what you are saying.

0:30:42.940,0:30:43.720
Yes, daddy.

0:30:43.720,0:30:50.280
Jesus does not want you to succeed and lose your kid to drugs.

0:30:50.280,0:30:56.240
He does not want you to succeed financially and lose your kid to militants.

0:30:56.240,0:31:01.620
He does not want you to succeed and lose your kid to the world.

0:31:01.620,0:31:03.240
What do you want to say about that?

0:31:03.240,0:31:04.060
Yes, daddy.

0:31:04.060,0:31:06.340
The one at home.

0:31:06.340,0:31:14.420
By the grace of God, I'm teaching them the way of God because I want them to grow in the fear...

0:31:14.420,0:31:15.700
And they listen to you?

0:31:15.700,0:31:17.900
Yes, daddy. By the grace of God, they listen to me.

0:31:17.900,0:31:19.240
Your daughter listens to you?

0:31:19.240,0:31:21.880
Yes, daddy, by the grace of God.

0:31:21.880,0:31:26.640
DonÂ´t - why the grace of God? It is the grace of God.

0:31:26.640,0:31:32.700
Nowadays when you hear a Christian saying, "By the grace of God, I will get there", it is a lie.

0:31:32.700,0:31:37.120
He is saying, expressing a doubt.

0:31:37.120,0:31:41.500
When a man says, "By the grace of God, I will get there", he is expressing doubt.

0:31:41.500,0:31:44.220
What kind of grace?

0:31:44.220,0:31:47.780
Grace is not a mango.

0:31:47.780,0:31:51.920
Okay, we are helping you. Now you know the message, you are to go back.

0:31:51.920,0:31:54.260
You have a job to do.

0:31:54.260,0:31:59.740
Most especially that daughter. You have to go back and work on her.

0:31:59.740,0:32:00.600
Yes, daddy.

0:32:00.600,0:32:01.460
Okay?

0:32:01.460,0:32:05.640
If not, you may likely lose it all.

0:32:05.640,0:32:08.760
That is, the blessing you have.

0:32:08.760,0:32:10.480
Yes, daddy.

0:32:10.480,0:32:19.180
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:32:19.180,0:32:20.960
Thank you.

0:32:20.960,0:32:26.600
When I heard the message, "Jesus does not want me to succeed because He wants to prepare me

0:32:26.600,0:32:30.100
or prepare my children for my future",

0:32:30.100,0:32:33.960
this made me to remember a dream I had some time ago.

0:32:33.960,0:32:38.600
Before you go further - did you listen to  the way she turned it now?

0:32:38.600,0:32:44.060
She said it is like God is building character, that is why her success is delayed.

0:32:44.060,0:32:48.760
If you don't have character and you succeed, you may likely lose it all.

0:32:48.760,0:32:52.520
Clap for her.

0:32:52.520,0:32:56.680
So, for you now to be thinking that "God does not answer my prayer"...

0:32:56.680,0:33:01.860
No, who told you that God does not answer your prayer. He loves you; HeÂ´s busy building character.

0:33:01.860,0:33:06.840
Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:33:06.840,0:33:09.920
I think the message I will take home is that

0:33:09.920,0:33:14.840
nothing good happens without discipline.

0:33:14.840,0:33:21.180
All challenges a human being has is a part of discipline.

0:33:21.180,0:33:25.340
You cannot have salvation without discipline.

0:33:25.340,0:33:28.640
Clap for him.

0:33:28.640,0:33:30.460
Did you listen to that?

0:33:30.460,0:33:33.840
It's not possible to have salvation without discipline.

0:33:33.840,0:33:37.900
If you have that salvation, you will lose it all.

0:33:37.900,0:33:43.320
No salvation without discipline. Nothing good happens without discipline.

0:33:43.320,0:33:46.600
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

0:33:46.600,0:33:53.560
Without salvation - you're looking for salvation, trying to earn it.

0:33:53.560,0:33:57.060
Because everything you earn,

0:33:57.060,0:34:03.440
it's only by the time you agree with yourself that "This is what I can do,

0:34:03.440,0:34:08.300
that money is good" - but not just getting money from all angles,

0:34:08.300,0:34:11.960
there is money that is without process

0:34:11.960,0:34:15.120
and when it comes to you, it's actually not going to help you.

0:34:15.120,0:34:18.220
That money is good but with process.

0:34:18.220,0:34:20.300
Thank you. Clap for him.

0:34:20.300,0:34:22.500
Did you listen to that?

0:34:22.500,0:34:27.580
So it is time now to begin to think inwardly.

0:34:27.580,0:34:32.580
Many of us here are heading a company.

0:34:32.580,0:34:37.100
Many of us here own their own company.

0:34:37.100,0:34:41.380
There are many MDs, general managers here.

0:34:41.380,0:34:48.420
You can still look back. Even your little house, you cannot manage them.

0:34:48.420,0:34:52.980
Are you talking of those of us that have a company -

0:34:52.980,0:34:58.100
your car, house - one can see that this is a general manager.

0:34:58.100,0:35:09.160
There are many marriages today - tension, so much tension

0:35:09.160,0:35:12.660
because God's time is the best.

0:35:12.660,0:35:14.760
Take a lesson.

0:35:14.760,0:35:22.500
We also have many here that are blessed - you have money, you have enough.

0:35:22.500,0:35:27.140
Where are your children?

0:35:27.140,0:35:35.500
Many of our children - we have lost them to the world.

0:35:35.500,0:35:42.240
If you don't quickly run to God and look back,

0:35:42.240,0:35:47.320
seek for solution for these children, you may likely lose it all.

0:35:47.320,0:35:56.420
Like I have said, Jesus does not want us to end our days saying,

0:35:56.420,0:36:01.860
"I could have been, I should have been, I would have been".

0:36:01.860,0:36:04.780
LetÂ´s hear from you.

0:36:04.780,0:36:09.840
I have learnt that before you believe, you must get your own revelation.

0:36:09.840,0:36:14.260
You must believe in God through the Holy Spirit to get a revelation.

0:36:14.260,0:36:19.660
There's nothing that you can become - an MD - without carrying your children along.

0:36:19.660,0:36:23.900
You must always carry your children along.

0:36:23.900,0:36:25.540
Did you listen to that?

0:36:25.540,0:36:28.580
They are an integral part of you.

0:36:28.580,0:36:39.140
On the last day, our Lord Jesus will ask you, "Where are they?"

0:36:39.140,0:36:43.420
Will you tell Jesus, "I have lost them to drugs"?

0:36:43.420,0:36:47.300
Will you tell JesÃºs, "I have lost them to militants"?

0:36:47.300,0:36:50.900
Will you tell Jesus, "I have lost them to the world"?

0:36:50.900,0:36:53.080
Question mark.

0:36:53.080,0:36:57.040
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:36:57.040,0:36:58.480
Thank you.

0:36:58.480,0:36:59.980
Anyone?

0:36:59.980,0:37:01.740
Okay, my brother here.

0:37:01.740,0:37:06.880
I've learned that life is a marathon, not a sprint

0:37:06.880,0:37:14.060
and God can use any situation to discipline us.

0:37:14.060,0:37:17.340
So we must value the process.

0:37:17.340,0:37:19.480
Thank you. Clap for him.

0:37:19.480,0:37:21.380
Did you listen to that?

0:37:21.380,0:37:25.420
Our brother is taking us through to process.

0:37:25.420,0:37:36.680
That if you want to become God's person, you must follow His process.

0:37:36.680,0:37:38.520
Are you there?

0:37:38.520,0:37:40.860
Let's hear from our sister.

0:37:40.860,0:37:42.240
Good morning, Church.

0:37:42.240,0:37:43.020
Good morning.

0:37:43.020,0:37:47.300
What I learnt today is that there is no shortcut in life.

0:37:47.300,0:37:53.520
That as we are a work of art in God's hand, we must wait patiently

0:37:53.520,0:37:58.820
and follow His process so that whatsoever we will receive in life,

0:37:58.820,0:38:02.420
will stand a test of time. Emmanuel!

0:38:02.420,0:38:03.880
Did you listen to that?

0:38:03.880,0:38:09.360
She said, you are a work of art.

0:38:09.360,0:38:11.140
Thank you.

0:38:11.140,0:38:17.180
You know you take a pen, you are taking a picture, trying to draw some objects.

0:38:17.180,0:38:21.320
Tell your neighbour, "I'm a work of art".

0:38:21.320,0:38:24.000
Again and again.

0:38:24.000,0:38:32.280
If you want to be a person of God, you must follow His process.

0:38:32.280,0:38:33.400
Thank you.

0:38:33.400,0:38:37.780
What I'm taking back home with me - I have learnt here that

0:38:37.780,0:38:41.820
we cannot separate Christianity from power.

0:38:41.820,0:38:45.080
The revelation I got here for myself is that

0:38:45.080,0:38:55.220
the wisdom is to see but seeing is also power from God and responsibility

0:38:55.220,0:39:00.140
which means, through the power of God, we can change the situation.

0:39:00.140,0:39:03.980
My brother must like power.

0:39:03.980,0:39:08.540
Power - my brother likes power. Clap for my brother.

0:39:08.540,0:39:14.300
You can see in the statement that he mentioned power up to four times.

0:39:14.300,0:39:22.660
That is, revelation brings conviction and conviction brings real movement.

0:39:22.660,0:39:29.660
Real movement - power steps.

0:39:29.660,0:39:31.240
Can you understand that?

0:39:31.240,0:39:37.660
Power steps - steps with intent and purpose.

0:39:37.660,0:39:40.300
Clap for my brother. Thank you very much.

0:39:40.300,0:39:45.260
With this, you can know if you are born again.

0:39:45.260,0:39:49.640
You can know.

0:39:49.640,0:39:53.320
The question - what kind of Christian do you want to be?

0:39:53.320,0:39:54.240
Ask you neighbour.

0:39:54.240,0:39:57.140
What kind of Christian do you want to be?

0:39:57.140,0:39:58.100
I can't hear you.

0:39:58.100,0:40:00.300
What kind of Christian do you want to be?

0:40:00.300,0:40:04.120
Because there are many Christians - Christians without the power of the Holy Ghost,

0:40:04.120,0:40:07.140
Christians with the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:40:07.140,0:40:10.120
Because to be a Christian, you must be led by the Holy Ghost.

0:40:10.120,0:40:13.240
And many Christians today are not led by the Holy Ghost.

0:40:13.240,0:40:17.160
That's why I'm asking you what kind of Christian you want to be.

0:40:17.160,0:40:20.780
What kind of leader do you want to be? -  A leader with purpose.

0:40:20.780,0:40:23.420
A leader with difference

0:40:23.420,0:40:32.360
So when we talk of power, as a Christian, you need to ask what kind of Christian you want to be.

0:40:32.360,0:40:35.660
When the Bible says in 1 Corinthians verses 12-30,

0:40:35.660,0:40:40.820
"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' without the help of the Holy Ghost",

0:40:40.820,0:40:45.180
no one can be a Christian without the help of the Holy Ghost.

0:40:45.180,0:40:46.880
Thank you. Our brother.

0:40:46.880,0:40:49.080
Good morning, Church.

0:40:49.080,0:40:54.580
The lesson I learnt today, that I will take home is about character and self-discipline.

0:40:54.580,0:40:59.860
We are not to rush to have big things while we cannot manage small things.

0:40:59.860,0:41:02.940
The man of God talked about not being able to clean a small car,

0:41:02.940,0:41:05.480
but you want to run a fleet of Benz.

0:41:05.480,0:41:07.440
Clap for my brother.

0:41:07.440,0:41:09.300
Did you listen to that?

0:41:09.300,0:41:15.340
Yes! You want to have your own company,

0:41:15.340,0:41:21.000
fleet of companies and you cannot keep your car clean.

0:41:21.000,0:41:27.420
You'll be very surprised to see many owners of companies if you open their garage.

0:41:27.420,0:41:33.100
They cannot do anything. They have housemaid, houseboy - money cannot do anything.

0:41:33.100,0:41:36.440
What are you talking about?

0:41:36.440,0:41:51.440
You have to lead by example; if not, you will lose it all.

0:41:51.440,0:41:55.400
Like that.

0:41:55.400,0:42:01.000
We have many of us here that this message is talking to.

0:42:01.000,0:42:03.920
You own companies.

0:42:03.920,0:42:08.320
Not one, not two, not three companies.

0:42:08.320,0:42:12.000
In a week, you may not even go to any of these companies

0:42:12.000,0:42:16.460
because you have money to employ people to do the job for you.

0:42:16.460,0:42:20.340
For how long will you continue this?

0:42:20.340,0:42:24.840
Can money run a company?

0:42:24.840,0:42:33.360
Your presence is a good thing to your worker and to your follower.

0:42:33.360,0:42:36.940
They want to know how you became what you are.

0:42:36.940,0:42:39.480
They want to know how you talk.

0:42:39.480,0:42:44.700
They want to know how you move. They want to know how you relate with people.

0:42:44.700,0:42:48.020
That will give them hope for the future.

0:42:48.020,0:42:54.200
But hardly - your staff, workers hardly see you one day.

0:42:54.200,0:42:56.640
They don't know their boss.

0:42:56.640,0:43:01.540
You live in Heaven.

0:43:01.540,0:43:03.240
Let's hear from our brother.

0:43:03.240,0:43:06.040
The word that I'm carrying with me home

0:43:06.040,0:43:10.560
is that the Word of God becomes part of us through meditation.

0:43:10.560,0:43:11.320
Yes.

0:43:11.320,0:43:16.400
The more you meditate, the more you hear the voice of the Lord

0:43:16.400,0:43:22.120
and the more you become the person of the Lord and will follow His processes.

0:43:22.120,0:43:24.840
Clap for him.

0:43:24.840,0:43:26.600
Did you listen to that?

0:43:26.600,0:43:31.360
Meditation brings revelation; revelation brings conviction

0:43:31.360,0:43:34.740
and conviction brings real movement.

0:43:34.740,0:43:36.980
Can you see? - Process.

0:43:36.980,0:43:44.880
If you want to be God's person, you must follow His process.

0:43:44.880,0:43:48.800
Meditation. What am I talking about now? Begin to meditate.

0:43:48.800,0:43:52.540
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate.

0:43:52.540,0:43:55.660
And turn it over and over in your heart.

0:43:55.660,0:44:02.000
Revelation comes and that revelation will become conviction and lead you to real movement.

0:44:02.000,0:44:07.360
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:44:07.360,0:44:12.860
Yes, the message I'm taking home is that life is a marathon and not a sprint.

0:44:12.860,0:44:17.480
and that discipline plays an important role in our lives.

0:44:17.480,0:44:20.420
Can you tell me how this affects you?

0:44:20.420,0:44:21.060
Me..?

0:44:21.060,0:44:22.360
Because you are a young man..

0:44:22.360,0:44:23.360
Yes, sir.

0:44:23.360,0:44:27.680
I know you are talking by your experience.

0:44:27.680,0:44:29.680
He's laughing.

0:44:29.680,0:44:32.040
People want to learn..

0:44:32.040,0:44:35.280
We are hungering for the knowledge, this Easter.

0:44:35.280,0:44:37.680
Hungry for the knowledge.

0:44:37.680,0:44:42.880
Most of us want to be successful so fast by using the shortcut.

0:44:42.880,0:44:46.000
Thank you. Clap for him.

0:44:46.000,0:44:48.460
Did you listen to that?

0:44:48.460,0:44:55.380
He's a young one so I know. He said, we want to make a shortcut,

0:44:55.380,0:45:01.400
forgetting that life is a marathon, not just a sprint.

0:45:01.400,0:45:07.300
Shortcut means, we are not waiting for God to build character.

0:45:07.300,0:45:10.860
If you don't wait for God to build this character in you,

0:45:10.860,0:45:19.980
by the time you get to your place of destiny, what happens?

0:45:19.980,0:45:26.740
Something will crash, explode and you will likely lose all.

0:45:26.740,0:45:29.300
This is what is happening today.

0:45:29.300,0:45:34.000
This is what is happening all over the world.

0:45:34.000,0:45:40.100
Character - like I have said - is oil in the lamp.

0:45:40.100,0:45:44.640
When there's no oil in the lamp, what happens to the light?

0:45:44.640,0:45:48.720
That's just it!  That's just you!

0:45:48.720,0:45:53.080
Now with this message, now you know why you are going through what you are going through.

0:45:53.080,0:45:58.520
It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.

0:45:58.520,0:45:59.560
Tell your neighbour,

0:45:59.560,0:46:07.980
"It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer".

0:46:07.980,0:46:08.820
Again..

0:46:08.820,0:46:14.040
"It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer."

0:46:14.040,0:46:19.100
"God, I need, I need, I need a car. I need a car. I need to pay my debt."

0:46:19.100,0:46:24.080
But after the prayer, nothing. The prayer seems not to answer.

0:46:24.080,0:46:27.520
I now say I have no faith. - No!

0:46:27.520,0:46:30.980
God is busy building character.

0:46:30.980,0:46:36.860
God knows, "If I give you what you want immediately - Ha!

0:46:36.860,0:46:40.880
Something will crash and you will likely lose it all".

0:46:40.880,0:46:44.280
So you say,"I have no faith". That is why you have stopped going to church.

0:46:44.280,0:46:47.480
"I have no faith." That is why you refuse to pray.

0:46:47.480,0:46:50.740
You pray, "Lord, I want to pass my examination".

0:46:50.740,0:46:58.700
But when the result come out, you find that there's some setback or failure.

0:46:58.700,0:47:04.980
You now say, "I fast. I pray. Even my friend that was not fasting, that was not praying,

0:47:04.980,0:47:11.120
has first class. But I fast, I pray but see me. I have third class".

0:47:11.120,0:47:20.340
No, the reason why you will not have your result is: God is holding you a little back;

0:47:20.340,0:47:23.540
He wants to build your character.

0:47:23.540,0:47:30.560
When the character comes, you can stand for the greatness that is coming.

0:47:30.560,0:47:35.020
The SCOAN Sunday service

0:47:35.020,0:47:40.460
The result of your prayer now is not all that important now but more important tomorrow.

0:47:40.460,0:47:41.600
Tell your neighbour again.

0:47:41.600,0:47:52.480
The result of my prayer now is not all that important now but more important tomorrow.

0:47:52.480,0:47:57.000
That is, what you are going to receive today after prayer from God

0:47:57.000,0:48:01.560
is important but more important tomorrow.

0:48:01.560,0:48:07.520
You need it in a difficult time; in the trial time, you need those results.

0:48:07.520,0:48:14.140
So please, God is trying to build character.

0:48:14.140,0:48:18.040
Listen to that. God is trying to do what? - To build character.

0:48:18.040,0:48:23.160
So that when you get to the place of your destiny,

0:48:23.160,0:48:30.540
you will not crash, explode and lose it all.

0:48:30.540,0:48:31.900
Okay, next.

0:48:31.900,0:48:35.700
I just want to thank God for revealing this revelation to me.

0:48:35.700,0:48:40.600
Because what I was going through, I didn't know that God was disciplining me.

0:48:40.600,0:48:46.700
My life was in a mess and I just thought, "What is going on in my life?"

0:48:46.700,0:48:51.720
Because my first time of coming here to this church, it was not for the salvation of my soul.

0:48:51.720,0:48:56.040
It was all about - I wanted business, making money.

0:48:56.040,0:49:01.040
But myself, I didn't have the character. Even the way I used to talk to people,

0:49:01.040,0:49:04.280
it was not representing that I am a Christian.

0:49:04.280,0:49:07.580
So I just want to thank God for this revelation

0:49:07.580,0:49:13.060
that God is building my character and it is God's processing.

0:49:13.060,0:49:14.440
Clap for my mum.

0:49:14.440,0:49:16.180
Good!

0:49:16.180,0:49:18.280
Did you listen to that?

0:49:18.280,0:49:25.080
My mum now realised that nothing good happens without discipline.

0:49:25.080,0:49:27.880
And what gives us discipline?  - God's character.

0:49:27.880,0:49:33.960
It is God's character that brings discipline; the proceeds of God's character is discipline.

0:49:33.960,0:49:37.540
Nothing good happens without what?

0:49:37.540,0:49:39.540
Without discipline.

0:49:39.540,0:49:44.080
Salvation cannot come without discipline.

0:49:44.080,0:49:48.380
Even the blessings we are waiting for or the healing we are waiting for now -

0:49:48.380,0:49:54.180
if you are healed without discipline, you will likely lose it.

0:49:54.180,0:49:57.800
If you are blessed without discipline, you will likely lose it.

0:49:57.800,0:50:05.300
If you are blessed without discipline, it will crash. And it will crash at a time you will need it most.

0:50:05.300,0:50:10.620
Emmanuel! What I've learnt today is that yes, God has provided for all our needs

0:50:10.620,0:50:12.980
but we are the cause of the delay

0:50:12.980,0:50:16.500
because we don't want to submit to God's discipline process.

0:50:16.500,0:50:19.440
Clap for my brother.

0:50:19.440,0:50:24.720
That is, we are the cause of delay because we don't want to submit.

0:50:24.720,0:50:30.420
We just want something from God but we are not ready to submit.

0:50:30.420,0:50:34.080
We are not ready for salvation; salvation is salvation.

0:50:34.080,0:50:38.420
We are not ready for salvation so we are the cause of delay.

0:50:38.420,0:50:40.700
Are you ready?

0:50:40.700,0:50:43.600
So listen to my brother. He said, "We are the cause of delay".

0:50:43.600,0:50:45.020
Are you ready?

0:50:45.020,0:50:46.400
- Yes!

0:50:46.400,0:50:48.760
Hallelujah! Thank you.
