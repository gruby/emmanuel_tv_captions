0:00:00.020,0:00:07.760
My name is Frank Azaya from Endo State. I was one of the deportees from Libya two days ago.

0:00:07.760,0:00:14.100
Before I left, I was staying in River state. I was doing business there.

0:00:14.100,0:00:19.040
I was going to Libya, from there to Europe to go and live a better life. As I was going,

0:00:19.040,0:00:25.860
on the way, the car we took to Libya - some people died in the car.

0:00:25.860,0:00:29.540
We thought that it is a very easy journey.

0:00:29.540,0:00:36.660
So on our way we were 34 in number in the car, some people died.

0:00:36.660,0:00:41.820
God helped us. He took us to Libya safely.

0:00:41.820,0:00:49.780
Along the line, as we were about to cross to Europe, we paid the connection man to take us to Europe.

0:00:49.780,0:00:55.260
As were are going, we sailed across the Mediterranean Sea starting from Libya.

0:00:55.260,0:01:01.500
On our way, close to international waters the people they call osama -

0:01:01.500,0:01:05.440
they came and cut us on top of the sea.

0:01:05.440,0:01:11.940
They took us to the underground prison. It's a very hidden place.

0:01:11.940,0:01:20.900
Nobody knows that place is existing. A lot of Africans are there - up to 500 people.

0:01:20.900,0:01:27.300
They use that place to do business. When they arrest people, they go and sell them to people.

0:01:27.300,0:01:34.140
People become bad human beings there. We were there almost four months and some weeks.

0:01:34.140,0:01:43.640
In our presence, people were dying there. They gave us one havza in a day.

0:01:43.640,0:01:48.020
Morning and evening. We were there and were crying to God.

0:01:48.020,0:01:53.260
So one day one Senegalese man came there.

0:01:53.260,0:01:58.340
He brought a phone from outside to a brother there.

0:01:58.340,0:02:03.560
Just to be clear brother. This underground prison that you were kept in - no one was

0:02:03.560,0:02:07.680
allowed to have a phone or any such device in prison, you were just kept there

0:02:07.680,0:02:11.460
in that room unable to go out for more than four months.

0:02:11.460,0:02:14.980
So as he brought the phone, we collected it.

0:02:14.980,0:02:17.840
This is a friend of mine, he said: "Ok, what do we do about the issue now?"

0:02:17.840,0:02:21.380
I said: "Let's tell people to come and help us

0:02:21.380,0:02:26.700
out of this place here, because nobody knows about that prison in Libya there."

0:02:26.700,0:02:35.260
So, as you have heard before, I was talking, calling upon T.B. Joshua,

0:02:35.260,0:02:43.780
Adiboye, people in the world to come and help us.That was July 7.

0:02:43.780,0:02:49.960
So you recorded this video inside cell within the Libyan prison

0:02:49.960,0:02:53.900
which was underground and you were calling on the Nigerian authorities.

0:02:53.900,0:03:00.380
You mentioned the names of several prominent men of God asking for help to release you from this prison.

0:03:00.380,0:03:10.300
Yes, I did this. Just for two days it was over. In the prison there - they received the video.

0:03:10.300,0:03:13.360
They now investigated that I am the one who send the video.

0:03:13.360,0:03:18.380
So they came to me. They pointed at me that I am the one who did the video.

0:03:18.380,0:03:23.500
They came to me, the man said they will hang me to death.

0:03:23.500,0:03:24.260
I was thinking that.....

0:03:24.260,0:03:28.620
Just before going ahead, people of God, we can see on the side of the screen

0:03:28.620,0:03:34.260
the video in question. Many people who are familiar with social media may have actually watched this video,

0:03:34.260,0:03:39.600
as it was spread around the internet showing the condition of the deportees

0:03:39.600,0:03:44.540
in Nigeria. He sent it to a friend telling him that they should expose this to the world

0:03:44.540,0:03:49.880
for people to know how they are suffering and what they are facing within the confines of

0:03:49.880,0:03:54.460
this underground prison. So you said two days after you sent this video -

0:03:54.460,0:03:56.460
tell us what happened to you, brother.

0:03:56.460,0:04:00.500
Though they now did see the video concerning the prison there. So the owner of the prison

0:04:00.500,0:04:05.140
came and investigated concerning the video. People pointed at me that

0:04:05.140,0:04:08.460
I am the one who sent the video. The man took me out of the prison.

0:04:08.460,0:04:11.400
He said he would sentence me to death.

0:04:11.400,0:04:16.940
So they took me to the back yard, they put chain on my neck, so they hung me.

0:04:16.940,0:04:25.060
And before I went on the journey, crossing the water, I dreamt about this our

0:04:25.060,0:04:28.440
father here T.B. Joshua. I saw him in the dream,

0:04:28.440,0:04:35.080
as he was praying for me. So as we were in the prison there, they took me to the back yard.

0:04:35.080,0:04:39.000
They went and hung there me with the chain.

0:04:39.000,0:04:42.280
In the morning, they thought that I'm dead.

0:04:42.280,0:04:48.480
They came and released me. So they took me and threw me

0:04:48.480,0:04:54.520
inside the forest. Getting there they found out that I'm still walking.

0:04:54.520,0:04:57.320
So they brought me back to prison.

0:04:57.320,0:05:01.460
Ok, so we want to understand very clearly. As a punishment for recording this video

0:05:01.460,0:05:06.580
you were hung with chains over night until they believed you had died.

0:05:06.580,0:05:09.560
They now took your body and took you to the forest.

0:05:09.560,0:05:12.320
What did they do when they got to the forest? What was their intention?

0:05:12.320,0:05:17.320
They took shovel to dig the ground so that they could bury me there.

0:05:17.320,0:05:21.640
They found out that I'm still walking.

0:05:21.640,0:05:23.840
You are still breathing.

0:05:23.840,0:05:28.940
As they carried you, your body was lifeless, you were limp. They thought you had died.

0:05:28.940,0:05:34.880
But as they were about to throw you into the shallow grave, they discovered that you were still breathing.

0:05:34.880,0:05:41.120
Yeah. They now brought me back to prison. As I was there, so they locked me

0:05:41.120,0:05:45.280
in a single cell in the underground there.

0:05:45.280,0:05:50.660
So two days after the men came to me and said that I must pay 10 000 dinars.

0:05:50.660,0:05:55.220
to translate to Nigerian money - 500 000 naira.

0:05:55.220,0:06:01.200
After four days I told the men that I didn't have that kind of money.

0:06:01.200,0:06:07.940
My people in Nigeria could hardly send me the amount of 180 000 naira

0:06:07.940,0:06:11.500
that is equal to 10 500 dinars. I paid them saying that this was what I had.

0:06:11.500,0:06:14.500
He collected the money. He was still keeping me here.

0:06:14.500,0:06:20.020
So after one week interval, ION now intervened in the issue.

0:06:20.020,0:06:25.900
As ION now came to the prison, they brought the whole Nigerian people out of the prison,

0:06:25.900,0:06:29.660
registered their names so that there were first deportees.

0:06:29.660,0:06:33.300
The men locked me inside the room. They said they would not deport me.

0:06:33.300,0:06:36.660
Why? Because I'm the one who did the video.

0:06:36.660,0:06:42.320
So as they registered those people, even my people here, they now told ION that

0:06:42.320,0:06:48.380
somebody inside that room did the video - they would not allow this young man to come out there.

0:06:48.380,0:06:52.080
That is how they advanced it for Tripoli.

0:06:52.080,0:06:55.140
They now called our embassy in Tripoli there.

0:06:55.140,0:06:57.700
So they called the ION people to come back to the prison again

0:06:57.700,0:07:02.520
to come and register me. And the next day, they came to the prison.

0:07:02.520,0:07:06.680
They told the owner of the prison that embassy is not involved in the issue,

0:07:06.680,0:07:09.880
that they should open the gate so that I would be registered.

0:07:09.880,0:07:12.300
That's how they brought me out of the prison.

0:07:12.300,0:07:18.940
So finally they registered me.The first day I found myself in Nigeria.

0:07:18.940,0:07:24.740
I am happy to be here. Actually, I said - let me go to this place to come and share my testimony,

0:07:24.740,0:07:30.200
to thank, appreciate the name of God, to come alive, to I appreciate the name of God

0:07:30.200,0:07:35.260
for all what God has been using this T.B. Joshua to do for people.

0:07:35.260,0:07:41.500
Before I got there, I saw in the dream the way he was acting both spiritually and physically.

0:07:41.500,0:07:44.680
That's why I'm here today to come and appreciate the name of God,

0:07:44.680,0:07:50.400
appreciating you also, the Lord will bless you in the name of Jesus.

0:07:50.400,0:07:52.920
Amen.

0:07:52.920,0:07:58.620
Let's just hear a very quick word from the brother beside him who actually took that very video.

0:07:58.620,0:08:02.160
Brother, if you introduce yourself and tell us that video you took.

0:08:02.160,0:08:07.260
My name is Efemena Amu Steven. I am from Delta State,

0:08:07.260,0:08:17.680
I am among the Libyan deportees that were brought to Nigeria from Libya on Thursday.

0:08:17.680,0:08:26.000
And I'm also among the prisoners that were being locked up in Osama prison in Libya.

0:08:26.000,0:08:36.640
The journey to Libya was horrible and the experience - it was like a horror film.

0:08:36.640,0:08:45.580
When we were finally caught in the sea, we were taken to  the prison.

0:08:45.580,0:08:51.960
We got to discover that the prison is meant for business and not for deportation.

0:08:51.960,0:08:59.140
If not for the video that we did, that we sent out, we wouldn't have been here today

0:08:59.140,0:09:08.060
because in that video we expose the activities of the prison and that was how almost the whole

0:09:08.060,0:09:14.540
of the other African people, from other countries - that was how they got their freedom.

0:09:14.540,0:09:20.820
We thank God that the brothers here are out safely. Let's just hear from the other brother as well.

0:09:20.820,0:09:24.220
Please, introduce yourself and tell us your own side the story.

0:09:24.220,0:09:25.840
Emmanuel! (God is with us! - Matthew 1:23)

0:09:25.840,0:09:30.720
My names are Miracle Chidi. I am from Imo State.

0:09:30.720,0:09:37.880
My journey to Libya was horrible. I was heading to Europe and not Libya.

0:09:37.880,0:09:43.640
But unfortunately, I found myself in Libya after spending years.

0:09:43.640,0:09:48.880
On that Mediterranean Sea - we spent three days on top of that sea.

0:09:48.880,0:09:52.540
Even when we got to International, we lost souls there.

0:09:52.540,0:10:00.860
Osama held us captive there in the sea. We were taken back to Libya.

0:10:00.860,0:10:06.020
We thought they were about to deport us, not knowing that it was for a business.

0:10:06.020,0:10:11.140
They took us to the prison. We spent months there. People died.

0:10:11.140,0:10:19.920
Beatings everyday, no food. No good water. No treatments. I was passing out blood

0:10:19.920,0:10:28.720
for weeks in that prison, almost pleading every day, crying and sharing tears just to get just nothing.

0:10:28.720,0:10:35.660
Finally, some people born there died. If it was not for the wisdom that was applied for the video,

0:10:35.660,0:10:41.480
I don't think we could have come back to Nigeria alive because we lost souls every day.

0:10:41.480,0:10:46.140
We give glory to God that our brethren are here, right now we want to listen to another one

0:10:46.140,0:10:51.760
of the deportees who will share a slightly different experience concerning what happened

0:10:51.760,0:10:56.520
to him when he underwent this horrific journey into Libya.

0:10:56.520,0:10:59.800
Brother, please introduce yourself and tell us your own side of this story.

0:10:59.800,0:11:05.660
My names are Mr Esosa Odike. I'm from  Edo state.

0:11:05.660,0:11:12.120
What really happened in my journey? I experienced something that I have never seen in my entire life.

0:11:12.120,0:11:17.620
I went to Libya just to cross and we were not there to stay.

0:11:17.620,0:11:26.060
but unfortunately, the worst part that I have seen in that journey was on top of the sea, the Mediterranean Sea.

0:11:26.060,0:11:30.000
I spent three days on top of the Mediterranean  Sea,

0:11:30.000,0:11:33.600
when they pushed us because they call it 'lapalapa' - the boat they use,

0:11:33.600,0:11:37.280
it's just a polin - the one they use for canopy. They sew it together,

0:11:37.280,0:11:42.000
pump it, fill it with gas and air - that is what they put passengers in.

0:11:42.000,0:11:48.640
The lowest number of passengers they load on it is 120, 122, 130. That is how they would cross the Mediterranean Sea that has no end.

0:11:48.640,0:11:51.780
So we were on top of the Mediterranean Sea...

0:11:51.780,0:11:55.120
How many people were in the boat that you were in? How many people?

0:11:55.120,0:12:01.680
In my boat we were 122. We spent three days without rescue, the sea

0:12:01.680,0:12:06.400
is three colours, white, blue,  black. After moving for three days without

0:12:06.400,0:12:11.440
getting rescued, so we had to turn back. The heavy wave came and the boat capsized.

0:12:11.440,0:12:15.980
But the greatest thing that I saw that gave me joy, when we were in our camp -

0:12:15.980,0:12:20.360
before they pushed us, we always prayed and I always watched Emmanuel TV.

0:12:20.360,0:12:26.240
in my GoTV  at home. And we always prayed in the name of God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:26.240,0:12:28.700
On top of the sea, I began to call Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:28.700,0:12:33.380
But 118 people died in my boat, remaining 4.

0:12:33.380,0:12:40.360
So among the 4;  I was number 1, my brother that put on the black jacket second,

0:12:40.360,0:12:46.240
and 2 other girls. We were the only  4 people that survived among those 122.

0:12:46.240,0:12:51.680
So, I didn't even believed I would survive. So when I saw myself in Nigeria,

0:12:51.680,0:12:56.120
I didn't believe. Even as I am here, I don't even believe I'm still alive.

0:12:56.120,0:12:59.800
Could you share with us, brother - how was it that you were able to survive and what did you see

0:12:59.800,0:13:03.760
at that moment that shocked you, when you were in the ocean?

0:13:03.760,0:13:07.720
After 2 days, the third day we decided to turn the boat back.

0:13:07.720,0:13:10.920
The captain said we should return the boat because there was no rescue.

0:13:10.920,0:13:16.260
As we were coming, there was a wave... Automatically, before the wave get to where we were,

0:13:16.260,0:13:20.800
I saw people that were dining and wining in the camp,

0:13:20.800,0:13:23.840
they began to manipulate, change into vampires,

0:13:23.840,0:13:29.200
their teeth began to grow, their fingers began to grow, they began to attack each other.

0:13:29.200,0:13:33.860
If anyone bit the other one, the other one would turn to the same thing.

0:13:33.860,0:13:38.900
They began to attack themselves. Then I saw that in the midst of humans there were vampires.

0:13:38.900,0:13:43.660
I have never seen it in my life before. But on top of the boat I saw people turning to vampires.

0:13:43.660,0:13:48.000
Ok, we want to understand very clearly. At the point when the boat was about to capsize -

0:13:48.000,0:13:53.020
one of the people inside the boat, you saw them, suddenly as their teeth grew

0:13:53.020,0:13:58.700
and they started biting other members within the people on that group on the boat.

0:13:58.700,0:14:00.760
And what would happen to the people that they bit?

0:14:00.760,0:14:04.840
What happened to the people they bit - assuming, if they bit me,

0:14:04.840,0:14:08.960
I would bite another person, that one will bite another person and anybody that they bite

0:14:08.960,0:14:12.660
would change and be like them. So immediately, as the boat broke

0:14:12.660,0:14:16.480
from the middle - because they put a board on top -

0:14:16.480,0:14:20.400
and immediately as the boat broke into two, the lapalapa now covered

0:14:20.400,0:14:25.260
So everybody that was sitting in n the center - about 70 to 77 -

0:14:25.260,0:14:27.380
immediately all of them fell inside the water.

0:14:27.380,0:14:32.260
Yes, all of them fell inside the water. Some of them came up again, they entered the boat.

0:14:32.260,0:14:38.340
Instantly, men, women, boys, girls, pregnant women began to manipulate.

0:14:38.340,0:14:42.340
Pregnant women that were in that boat  were up to about 40. All of them died.

0:14:42.340,0:14:47.040
The babies that were up there began to die. I saw vampires, people growing

0:14:47.040,0:14:52.480
teeth. They would just bite, as they bit - I  am still seeing the picture.

0:14:52.480,0:14:56.360
As they bit, the other one would bite the other, the other one would bite the other one.

0:14:56.360,0:14:59.320
So I was scared, so I ran back

0:14:59.320,0:15:05.280
calling  God of Pastor T.B. Joshua. But when I see the miracle of God in the camp

0:15:05.280,0:15:12.240
and in the water, especially on the Mediterranean Sea - I believe, I will die in the house of God.

0:15:12.240,0:15:18.400
So our brother is re-narrating his experience what he saw with his own eyes,

0:15:18.400,0:15:23.520
when he was on the top of the ocean, as his boat capsized. This is not

0:15:23.520,0:15:27.280
a horror film or something that he just imagined. This was his own experience

0:15:27.280,0:15:32.420
as people were dying in his midst. Brother, how did you actually survive? What did you do?

0:15:32.420,0:15:36.820
How did you manage to survive, when all the of the 90% of your colleagues drowned?

0:15:36.820,0:15:43.700
On top of the boat, after 3 days, after we saw people on top of the sea - they looked like birds.

0:15:43.700,0:15:50.740
Dead bodies - the water began to float them, so I kept holding the boat because on that boat

0:15:50.740,0:15:55.820
there was a rope that they put round the boat, that rope lead to the general valve.

0:15:55.820,0:16:00.420
So I held the rope and we were still calling the God of Pastor T.B. Joshua. I held the boat

0:16:00.420,0:16:05.060
without no shirt. I was with just a knicker. I was not with a life jacket,

0:16:05.060,0:16:10.020
I was on top of the boat. On the third day, a ship came.

0:16:10.020,0:16:13.660
Those Chinese people were inside.

0:16:13.660,0:16:18.860
So they took us to the ship. So they promised that they would give us shelter, they would take us to their place.

0:16:18.860,0:16:25.160
But when we were sleeping, then we saw some policemen putting on soldier uniform.

0:16:25.160,0:16:29.780
So they were Libyans. They woke us up, and they took me and my friend and the other two girls

0:16:29.780,0:16:34.560
back to Libya. That is how we have been imprisoned till Thursday morning,

0:16:34.560,0:16:36.740
when they brought us out and deported us.

0:16:36.740,0:16:40.840
Let's hear from the other gentleman who was also a survivor on this boat.

0:16:40.840,0:16:46.860
As we listen, we say that there was 120 plus people in the boat and only 4 survived,

0:16:46.860,0:16:52.620
two of them are in our midst. So brother, can you share briefly your own side of this experience.

0:16:52.620,0:16:58.740
My names are Iboye Ufuoma. I am from Delta state.

0:16:58.740,0:17:05.520
The worsest thing I have ever experienced in my life was is encountering on that route to Libya.

0:17:05.520,0:17:09.600
I have not seen a thing like this before.

0:17:09.600,0:17:13.100
But the most worseful one is in the sea.

0:17:13.100,0:17:17.820
Likewise my brother have said, that was the worsest experience.

0:17:17.820,0:17:24.000
We were 122 in the boat. We were seeking asylum abroad,

0:17:24.000,0:17:30.880
to make sure we can survive. So as we approached, we've been in the sea for 3 days.

0:17:30.880,0:17:37.100
At the end of the day, a mighty wave came and smashed our boat and the boat teared into two.

0:17:37.100,0:17:43.140
Out of that boat, inside the boat, everybody in the middle sank inside the water.

0:17:43.140,0:17:51.960
So it was remaining only four of us, and out of the four - two were women, the other two were boys.

0:17:51.960,0:17:58.340
So I have been in that water; all my legs were eaten up by fishes. Fish were eating my legs.

0:17:58.340,0:18:03.740
And do you know my body was...I don't know because the salty water was eating up all my body,

0:18:03.740,0:18:09.200
and there were fish feeding under my leg. So a thought came to me because when we were in the camp,

0:18:09.200,0:18:10.980
we were always using the God of T.B. Joshua to pray.

0:18:10.980,0:18:16.360
The mind came to me and said - why don't you shout the name of God of T.B. Joshua,

0:18:16.360,0:18:23.080
if all those things that are growing up here". Because I finally noticed that there were people manifesting

0:18:23.080,0:18:27.340
a kind of things I have never experienced before. People were growing up teeth.

0:18:27.340,0:18:32.520
Everyone that fell inside the water, when he came out - he came out with another shape.

0:18:32.520,0:18:38.560
They were growing up teeth, growing up fingers. They were biting the one inside the boat again.

0:18:38.560,0:18:40.680
So everywhere was just scattered.

0:18:40.680,0:18:44.420
Brother, you know people, it's difficult for people to believe what you are saying

0:18:44.420,0:18:49.480
because it's a strange thing. You mean, that when people were drowning, as they entered the water

0:18:49.480,0:18:54.500
that very same person, when they came back - you would see their features have changed?

0:18:54.500,0:18:59.940
Their teeth had grown, they had grown claws and they became very wild

0:18:59.940,0:19:03.920
and aggressive. Is this what you yourself saw with your  eyes on this sea?

0:19:03.920,0:19:07.700
That was exactly what I experienced. People were growing up teeth.

0:19:07.700,0:19:11.440
The people we were meeting with inside the boat were growing up teeth again

0:19:11.440,0:19:15.800
to eat up the people inside the boat. That was how the boat finally capsized.

0:19:15.800,0:19:19.620
After the boat capsized, it was remaining only four of us.

0:19:19.620,0:19:22.420
This my brother here; and some other two women.

0:19:22.420,0:19:26.080
Those ones have gone to their various places.

0:19:26.080,0:19:30.800
So it was terrible, so terrible that I have not seen in my life but I have witnessed it.

0:19:30.800,0:19:35.920
But to the glory of God you survived. You said, even your skin changed colour because

0:19:35.920,0:19:37.810
of the salt in the water.

0:19:37.810,0:19:41.760
My skin totally changed because the water is salty water.

0:19:41.760,0:19:48.000
It eats up my body. And the fishes were feeding under my legs. So immediately I called on the name of

0:19:48.000,0:19:55.160
the God of T.B. Joshua, the next day we saw a ship that came from nowhere

0:19:55.160,0:20:00.200
that rescued us. Inside the ship they were white men from China.

0:20:00.200,0:20:05.680
After they finished the rescue, they said we shouldn't worry,

0:20:05.680,0:20:13.260
that they would give us shelter, they would make us ok, that they would handle us to their country

0:20:13.260,0:20:15.900
and take good care of us.

0:20:15.900,0:20:22.680
In the night, when we were sleeping, suddenly we saw some people putting on military uniform.

0:20:22.680,0:20:26.760
They came to wake us up. To my greatest surprise I said: "What is this?

0:20:26.760,0:20:30.540
You people promised us that you will take us to their place. So what am I seeing?"

0:20:30.540,0:20:35.680
They said we should get up in Libyan language. They said: "Asma, tahala!"

0:20:35.680,0:20:41.320
I said: "What on earth is tahala?"

0:20:41.320,0:20:47.840
So what our brother is explaining is that even after suffering in such a condition

0:20:47.840,0:20:52.800
seeing, witnessing  his own colleagues drowning before his eyes, some of them even transforming

0:20:52.800,0:20:55.920
into demonic figures, as a result of that death -

0:20:55.920,0:21:02.020
even after that way he survived, he was still taken back to Lybia into captivity.

0:21:02.020,0:21:08.020
So the effort all the years and months he spent going abroad in attempt to reach Europe -

0:21:08.020,0:21:11.300
he never even reached the destination he tried to get to.

0:21:11.300,0:21:14.040
He went back to Lybia and back to the prison.

0:21:14.040,0:21:18.160
And that was how you finally were deported back to Nigeria with your colleagues two days ago.

0:21:18.160,0:21:18.880
Is that right?

0:21:18.880,0:21:26.980
Yes, that was how I finally deported  here to Nigeria and I had spent a lot of months in the prison.

0:21:26.980,0:21:29.320
Eating havza daily.

0:21:29.320,0:21:33.960
Let's just hear from the other young man there to quickly conclude the experiences

0:21:33.960,0:21:38.860
of our brothers. Brother, just introduce yourself to us and tell us what happened to you when you were in Libya.

0:21:38.860,0:21:45.040
My name is Mathias Edegbe. I am from Eboni state, Abakaliki Town.

0:21:45.040,0:21:52.160
I went to Libya last year April. As I went to Lybia, I went to cross to Europe.

0:21:52.160,0:21:58.620
We reached the Mediterranean Sea. They arrested us, they took us back to dry land.

0:21:58.620,0:22:02.320
As we were coming back to dry land, the boat capsized.

0:22:02.320,0:22:07.760
People died. So they called rescue. Some people were rescued and did go back to dry land.

0:22:07.760,0:22:14.200
So I was trying to escape from them. The street boys catched me and put back

0:22:14.200,0:22:20.180
to the prison. As I was trying to pray that day, it was around 12 o'clock in the night.

0:22:20.180,0:22:25.900
The Arab man came, he said: "What is happening, why are you making noise inside the prison?"

0:22:25.900,0:22:31.800
I told him that I wanted to pray. That is how he brought gun and started to shoot inside the house.

0:22:31.800,0:22:37.980
Many people died. He held me and used  bottle and knife

0:22:37.980,0:22:43.860
and cut my hand. Look at my hand. My teeth almost came out of my mouth.

0:22:43.860,0:22:48.940
They used gun and broke my head. I received some injuries inside my body,

0:22:48.940,0:22:53.320
as we are talking just now. So that one passed.

0:22:53.320,0:22:57.320
This year I still tried to cross to Europe.

0:22:57.320,0:23:03.300
So brother, the scars we are seeing on your arms are wounds that were inflicted

0:23:03.300,0:23:06.640
upon you in the Libyan prison, when they told you to stop making noise

0:23:06.640,0:23:12.800
during your prayer. They used a glass to open and tear skin on your arm

0:23:12.800,0:23:17.440
and even displaced the bone in your arm. Is that right?

0:23:17.440,0:23:21.960
So what we are seeing - is the bone coming out, sir?

0:23:21.960,0:23:27.740
This is the bone. They beat me and used knife, bottle and cut my hand.

0:23:27.740,0:23:34.320
So this year, I went to cross again. Almost the same thing that happened last year - that's how it happened.

0:23:34.320,0:23:38.120
And that is how you were deported back to Nigeria with your colleagues?

0:23:38.120,0:23:45.480
Ok, let's finally hear from the lady at the far end who actually came with a very small child.

0:23:45.480,0:23:50.940
Libya Deportees Share Life Experiences

0:23:50.940,0:23:55.120
Can you introduce yourself to us and tell us your own experiences in Libya.

0:23:55.120,0:24:00.700
My name is Ada. I stayed in Nigeria, before one of my friends from Germany

0:24:00.700,0:24:09.680
said I should come. So I reached Saba, where the guy came to pick me up.

0:24:09.680,0:24:15.420
So I went to see the connection man to help me to find work.

0:24:15.420,0:24:18.940
When I got there, I worked for two months.

0:24:18.940,0:24:26.000
The woman came and she beat me. As she beat me. She asked me to bring a cup

0:24:26.000,0:24:30.880
and I brought plate because these words are related in Arabic.

0:24:30.880,0:24:39.580
So she beat me. There they are used to stay on ground not mopping.

0:24:39.580,0:24:42.620
They use something else.

0:24:42.620,0:24:47.740
So as I cleaned and finished - no food.

0:24:47.740,0:24:52.340
Instead of telling me to remove the tea cup,

0:24:52.340,0:24:54.980
she started beating me again.

0:24:54.980,0:24:59.380
I said I better run away from the big person like that.

0:24:59.380,0:25:03.440
Ok, so for the benefit of those who may not understand what our sister is explaining.

0:25:03.440,0:25:07.500
She is speaking in Pidgin English. She is explaining how she was among the people that

0:25:07.500,0:25:10.420
travelled illegally through the deserts to Libya

0:25:10.420,0:25:15.440
and upon arriving she was actually sold into slavery, where she was forced

0:25:15.440,0:25:21.440
to work under a particular lady who maltreated her, beat her mercilessly.

0:25:21.440,0:25:26.000
Even she was so confused, as a result of the beating that if she was asked to bring

0:25:26.000,0:25:29.460
something, she would bring the wrong thing which could lead to a lot of beating

0:25:29.460,0:25:33.740
and torture and she asked herself, is this what she travelled from Nigeria for,

0:25:33.740,0:25:38.180
to work, as a slave. So can you tell us, sister, how did you now end up in prison?

0:25:38.180,0:25:40.940
And what led to you being here with this little baby?

0:25:40.940,0:25:48.280
As I went around on the road, I met one boy on the road.

0:25:48.280,0:25:54.500
I said I needed help. He couldn't help me. I said: "Help me, put me in a house."

0:25:54.500,0:26:00.060
From there he gave me belly. He still 
couldn't help me.

0:26:00.060,0:26:04.160
She's explaining that she ran away from this particular lady and on the street,

0:26:04.160,0:26:10.320
she met some man who promised to help her. The man took her to his house and that man

0:26:10.320,0:26:15.140
impregnated her. So tell us, what happened after that, after you became pregnant for this man.

0:26:15.140,0:26:19.380
We couldn't go for pushing, they couldn't push us to go sea side - that is where we

0:26:19.380,0:26:26.160
went to cross to Europe. And I was pregnant.

0:26:26.160,0:26:32.220
So from there we could see a plane.

0:26:32.220,0:26:38.440
We believed this was the plane where they would direct us - Italian plane.

0:26:38.440,0:26:45.000
Arab men drove the boat. So we couldn't go the wrong side.

0:26:45.000,0:26:51.840
But here now water got spoiled. People even said last prayer. They didn't even finish.

0:26:51.840,0:26:56.100
Some stayed at this edge, and some stayed at this edge, as the waters slapped.

0:26:56.100,0:27:02.760
People fell in the water and entered inside the boat. I thiught I would die in this sea.

0:27:02.760,0:27:09.860
God brought a rescue - Libyan rescue.

0:27:09.860,0:27:15.280
So they rescued us. As they rescued us, we were imprisoned for 2 months.

0:27:15.280,0:27:17.280
I got confused.

0:27:17.280,0:27:22.520
Okay, so just to explain what our sister is saying. With this man that impregnated her

0:27:22.520,0:27:27.020
they attempted to travel on the sea to Europe through entering the rubber dinghy,

0:27:27.020,0:27:32.060
known as lapalapa - a very small boat, inflatable boat.

0:27:32.060,0:27:36.660
As they were going across the Mediterranean Sea, while she was pregnant,

0:27:36.660,0:27:40.440
although they saw a plane above which they believed was a signal that they would be rescued -

0:27:40.440,0:27:47.220
at that point, storm set in and people at the extreme end of the boat, began to fall into the water.

0:27:47.220,0:27:50.900
They died by drowning and then finally a boat came to rescue them

0:27:50.900,0:27:55.180
but they discovered that it was a Libyan boat who took them back to Libya,

0:27:55.180,0:27:59.200
and took them to prison. So whilst there in prison, tell us what happened there.

0:27:59.200,0:28:04.260
When we were in the prison, they wanted to escape.

0:28:04.260,0:28:10.860
As the guy who gave me child - before he ran, he said he was going to give me number,

0:28:10.860,0:28:16.320
so that I could locate him. He did not give me, I did not see him that night when they all escaped.

0:28:16.320,0:28:22.480
Before I knew, the car left. Now on one of them came to meet me saying: "That boy ran away,

0:28:22.480,0:28:27.260
left you here. What will you do now?" I said I did not know what to do

0:28:27.260,0:28:33.500
because he didn't give me his number. So I didn't hear from him for almost

0:28:33.500,0:28:36.180
two months now.

0:28:36.180,0:28:42.540
So I don't even know how to locate them.

0:28:42.540,0:28:48.320
Our sister is explaining that whilst they were in prison, the owner of the pregnancy,

0:28:48.320,0:28:53.280
her boyfriend burst out of the prison, escaped with several others inmates.

0:28:53.280,0:28:56.600
He told her to follow, but because she was heavily pregnant

0:28:56.600,0:29:03.260
she could not. And even before he left, he had not given her contact details of his family.

0:29:03.260,0:29:08.380
So there was no trace of him. She doesn't know now whether he's alive or dead.

0:29:08.380,0:29:13.280
She doesn't know the number or name of any of his family members and to this point

0:29:13.280,0:29:18.140
since he ran away from the prison, she has no idea of his whereabouts.

0:29:18.140,0:29:27.060
Mrs Ada & Baby
Libya Deportee Life Experience

0:29:27.060,0:29:31.480
So we are seeing our sister overcome by emotion. We can imagine what it means

0:29:31.480,0:29:39.260
for the father of her child to have disappeared and she has no ways of tracing or knowing the family

0:29:39.260,0:29:42.160
or even whether he's alive or dead right now.

0:29:42.160,0:29:45.960
And we can understand what our sister is passing through, the reason why she is crying.

0:29:45.960,0:29:47.500
Tell us, the baby you are holding...

0:29:47.500,0:29:55.820
So inside the prison, nobody to help. I got to call one Yoruba girl to help me.

0:29:55.820,0:30:04.420
She held me, she used granite soil to rub my vagina, to rub my back.

0:30:04.420,0:30:12.140
The baby's head didn't come outside. I pushed inside the prison there.

0:30:12.140,0:30:17.960
So as God may have it, that's how I gave birth to my baby.

0:30:17.960,0:30:21.900
No treatment, nothing. Even my belly is still big

0:30:21.900,0:30:29.940
because the blood from inside did not come outside.

0:30:29.940,0:30:33.720
Now I came here...

0:30:33.720,0:30:36.740
Okay, people of God, we are listening to our sister. A question, sister.

0:30:36.740,0:30:39.920
How old is this baby you are holding right now?

0:30:39.920,0:30:43.760
A week and three days.

0:30:43.760,0:30:47.740
So we're hearing from our sister the baby is just one week and three days old.

0:30:47.740,0:30:51.660
She delivered the baby in the Libyan prison

0:30:51.660,0:30:56.900
without any medical assistance with just the prisoners who were around

She has no way of knowing, where the father of this child is or contacting his family

0:31:07.520,0:31:11.940
and that's why she's among those that came to the Synagogue, Church Of All Nations

0:31:11.940,0:31:17.640
to seek supports and help. Now, people of God, we know that at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations
