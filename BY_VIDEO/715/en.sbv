0:00:04.820,0:00:06.620
Good morning church!

0:00:06.640,0:00:09.960
Congregation: Good Morning!

0:00:11.540,0:00:12.480
Hallelujah!

0:00:12.720,0:00:13.840
Congregation: Amen!

0:00:14.320,0:00:15.220
You may be seated.

0:00:15.220,0:00:16.040
Thank you

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:20.740,0:00:26.440
We are going to talk about a very, very important issue.

0:00:26.440,0:00:29.080
It has to do with relationships.

0:00:29.260,0:00:38.080
Natural, I mean, human relationships, are very, very important.

0:00:40.220,0:00:43.360
That is why we are here today.

0:00:44.080,0:00:46.480
I am talking to you.

0:00:46.960,0:00:49.840
Here and now.

0:00:50.500,0:00:54.480
Because you are there, listening to me.

0:00:54.520,0:01:01.500
If you are there listening me, you cannot come here. I would be talking to the air.

0:01:01.500,0:01:09.140
Viewers at home, I say I am talking to you because I believe you are there, listening.

0:01:09.140,0:01:11.140
Paying attention to me.

0:01:11.560,0:01:13.780
I want to thank you, thank you for that.

0:01:14.000,0:01:19.140
Today's message is: Let God release you.

0:01:19.920,0:01:20.820
Tell your neighbor!

0:01:20.820,0:01:23.440
Church: Let God release you!

0:01:23.820,0:01:24.880
In your business!

0:01:24.880,0:01:26.720
Church: in your business!

0:01:26.720,0:01:28.560
In your relationship!

0:01:28.560,0:01:30.540
Church: In your relationship!

0:01:30.540,0:01:51.000
Regular relationships, such as marriage, business, even friendship, can break out of sheer circumstances.

0:01:51.740,0:01:53.640
Just like that.

0:01:56.100,0:02:01.740
The origin of relationships is God.

0:02:02.580,0:02:07.180
Until God releases us, we cannot quit the relationship.

0:02:07.180,0:02:11.160
But today, it does not take us anything.

0:02:11.160,0:02:21.480
Just disagreement, misunderstanding, conflict, and we quit a relationship.

0:02:22.380,0:02:25.700
You cannot do it alone.

0:02:25.740,0:02:34.380
You keep quitting relationships: business partners, marriage, friendships.

0:02:34.380,0:02:36.060
You move from one church to another.

0:02:36.060,0:02:37.460
Just like that.

0:02:37.460,0:02:39.040
It doesn't take you anything.

0:02:39.240,0:02:46.380
Without God releasing you, when are you going to settle with relationships?

0:02:48.120,0:02:49.800
That is the question you need to ask yourself.

0:02:49.800,0:02:52.880
When are you going to settle with the relationship?

0:02:52.880,0:03:00.600
You can count how many business partners you have had in the past.

0:03:00.640,0:03:06.900
Friends.

0:03:06.980,0:03:13.820
And the Bible says relationship begins with who?

0:03:13.820,0:03:17.500
With God.

0:03:17.560,0:03:20.500
And then to humans.

0:03:20.580,0:03:30.200
Relationship begins with God, and then to humans.

0:03:30.220,0:03:40.560
If a relationship begins with God, we cannot just quit from it under any circumstance.

0:03:40.560,0:03:49.840
Something that you are not the origin of, you can't just quit under any circumstance.

0:03:49.840,0:03:59.900
Unless you are released, you cannot just quit from it.

0:03:59.980,0:04:06.500
And you know, God can speak through disagreement.

0:04:06.520,0:04:16.500
God can speak through conflict, through tribulation, and adversity.

0:04:16.500,0:04:18.560
God can speak through them.

0:04:18.560,0:04:24.800
He can speak joy through sadness.

0:04:24.880,0:04:32.360
If God does not release us, and we quit the relationship

0:04:32.360,0:04:38.840
because of disagreement, because of misunderstanding,

0:04:38.840,0:04:55.700
because of conflict, whatever, the way you quit is the way you will enter the next relationship.

0:04:55.720,0:04:57.820
Unless you are released.

0:04:57.820,0:05:01.780
We don't leave a relationship as Christian because of fights.

0:05:01.780,0:05:05.660
Because of disagreements, because of conflicts, or adversity.

0:05:05.660,0:05:11.740
We don't leave relationships because the man that is your enemy today, can be your savior tomorrow.

0:05:11.740,0:05:13.900
Look at many of you that are in the church today.

0:05:13.900,0:05:18.360
You know what you have said about this ministry before now.

0:05:18.360,0:05:21.300
Or what you have done about this ministry.

0:05:21.300,0:05:24.540
But today, you are here.

0:05:25.420,0:05:32.920
Let me quickly take you to the message from the book of John 20, verse 23.

0:05:32.920,0:05:35.580
John 20:23

0:05:35.580,0:05:42.640
"If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven.

0:05:42.640,0:05:48.100
If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

0:05:48.100,0:05:59.480
What the Bible is trying to say here is that, if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven.

0:05:59.480,0:06:07.560
But if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.

0:06:07.560,0:06:25.500
This means, we preserve the sins of other people when we pick up an offence, and harbor resentment.

0:06:25.540,0:06:35.120
It is impossible to establish a healthy, a good relationship

0:06:35.120,0:06:50.200
with a person who has left another relationship resentful and offended.

0:06:50.260,0:06:57.520
Someone who breaks a relationship because of misunderstanding or conflicts -

0:06:57.520,0:07:00.460
now becomes your friend?

0:07:00.460,0:07:01.800
There is no friendship there.

0:07:01.800,0:07:05.100
You are destroyed.

0:07:05.180,0:07:09.400
Come.

0:07:09.420,0:07:11.020
This is my brother.

0:07:11.120,0:07:13.360
We are friends.

0:07:13.360,0:07:17.340
But something happens and we start fighting.

0:07:17.340,0:07:18.120
Hey!

0:07:18.120,0:07:19.140
I don't know what happened.

0:07:19.140,0:07:20.940
You are foolish!

0:07:20.940,0:07:23.260
Maybe I am wrong, or maybe I am right.

0:07:23.260,0:07:25.540
Or you are wrong, or you are right.

0:07:25.540,0:07:36.400
We have no right to go with that conflict and establish another relationship.

0:07:36.800,0:07:43.680
If we now decided not to come together, and I now have another friend here.

0:07:43.680,0:07:50.520
This man is in trouble because the relationship we are going to establish is purely disease, affliction.

0:07:50.520,0:07:58.220
Because he has a broken relationship here- misunderstanding or disagreement that is unsettled.

0:07:58.220,0:08:00.140
But now you are now my friend.

0:08:00.140,0:08:04.300
And you too, you might have had your own, somewhere, and we come together.

0:08:04.300,0:08:18.140
Can you see the reason why we are facing relationships that are neither lasting nor rewarding?

0:08:18.140,0:08:25.380
This is why you end up with relationships without reward.

0:08:26.080,0:08:30.140
Because you fight this one, and you end the relationship.

0:08:30.140,0:08:32.700
And look for another friend.

0:08:32.700,0:08:42.900
Remember: You carry conflict, hatred, bitterness, offence, and become the friend of another person.

0:08:42.900,0:08:48.500
And the person, too, may also have a broken relationship somewhere.

0:08:48.500,0:08:50.420
And now the two of you are together.

0:08:50.420,0:08:53.360
Can you see the life we are living?

0:08:53.360,0:09:01.100
You cannot succeed alone. You need people. You need friends.

0:09:01.140,0:09:07.500
Jesus knew this. That is why He had disciples.

0:09:07.520,0:09:10.540
You will not be able to succeed alone.

0:09:10.540,0:09:14.680
It is impossible to establish a healthy, a good relationship,

0:09:14.680,0:09:24.240
with a person who has left another relationship bitter and offended.

0:09:24.240,0:09:27.720
You can never have a healthy relationship.

0:09:27.720,0:09:30.980
A rewarding relationship.

0:09:30.980,0:09:36.800
This is why today, when you see a broken home,

0:09:36.800,0:09:48.160
a divorced woman or man, marrying someone who is also divorced, at least 90% still divorced

0:09:48.160,0:09:55.600
Because the carryover they have where they are coming from.

0:09:55.620,0:10:07.700
If God releases you, you would not be under pressure to judge.

0:10:07.700,0:10:19.100
To be under pressure is to be under the control of our circumstances.

0:10:19.100,0:10:28.300
Allowing situations to control, mislead, and overwhelm us.

0:10:29.720,0:10:38.880
If you are released, you will go with joy, even in the face of adversity.

0:10:38.880,0:10:40.860
For a good example:

0:10:40.860,0:10:46.500
You know that attending church is a thing of God.

0:10:46.560,0:10:52.680
But today, someone just brought you here today.

0:10:52.680,0:10:56.200
Someone told you there are miracles here.

0:10:56.200,0:10:57.900
That is why you are here.

0:10:57.920,0:11:02.400
Someone just told you that a woman you have been looking for, for many years

0:11:02.400,0:11:04.700
is attending Synagogue Church.

0:11:04.700,0:11:06.700
That is why you are here today.

0:11:06.700,0:11:11.060
Someone just told you that your chairman is a member of the Synagogue Church.

0:11:11.060,0:11:12.700
That is why you are here today.

0:11:12.700,0:11:18.700
Someone told you that the man you are looking for a contract from, is a member of this church.

0:11:18.700,0:11:20.180
That is why you are here today.

0:11:20.180,0:11:26.600
Attending church is a thing of God.

0:11:26.600,0:11:33.900
When we go to church, we are answering God's invitation.

0:11:33.960,0:11:43.600
Do not leave under any circumstance because it is God's invitation.

0:11:43.660,0:11:55.560
Don't pull out of the church or a relationship under any circumstances.

0:11:55.560,0:12:03.340
Like disagreements, misunderstanding, taking offence.

0:12:03.340,0:12:10.700
Whether you are right or wrong.

0:12:10.720,0:12:16.100
We should let God release us.

0:12:16.100,0:12:21.200
We should let God do what?

0:12:21.200,0:12:27.060
If God releases you, even in the face of crisis, you will go with joy.

0:12:27.060,0:12:35.000
In the book of Isaiah 55, verse 12, it says you will go with joy.

0:12:35.640,0:12:50.480
Every Christian should realize that where God wants them to be, the devil will want to offend them to pull out.

0:12:51.500,0:13:07.200
If you are in a place where God wants you to be, the devil will want to offend you to pull out.

0:13:07.240,0:13:14.720
The devil is always interested in where God wants you to be!

0:13:14.720,0:13:17.160
Where God wants you to go!

0:13:17.160,0:13:19.480
Where God wants you to sit!

0:13:19.480,0:13:21.140
What God wants you to say.

0:13:21.140,0:13:23.000
The devil is interested in it.

0:13:24.160,0:13:32.740
Anytime you wake up, and you are going to business, and you start receiving an attack, or some accident happens, don't give up.

0:13:32.740,0:13:33.840
Continue to go there.

0:13:33.840,0:13:40.300
Anything close to Jesus receives attacks.

0:13:40.300,0:13:44.800
If your relationship with your wife or friend is being attacked,

0:13:44.800,0:13:54.520
or if your business is being attacked so much, know that this is where God wants you to be.

0:13:54.520,0:14:09.800
If you are in a place where God wants you, the devil will want to offend you to pull out.

0:14:09.880,0:14:15.800
You have abandoned a business that would have put you on the world map because of attacks.

0:14:16.560,0:14:22.840
You have abandoned a relationship that would have built your future and your career because of attacks.

0:14:22.840,0:14:24.260
You have abandoned...

0:14:24.260,0:14:25.300
Oh my God.

0:14:26.180,0:14:32.320
Think of the many things you have abandoned because of attacks, and threats, to your life.

0:14:32.700,0:14:42.620
A business that would have put you on the world map, you abandoned it because of too much debt and loss.

0:14:43.320,0:14:44.840
You abandoned it.

0:14:44.840,0:14:55.000
That is where and what God wants you to do. The devil knows and that is why he attacking you.

0:14:55.060,0:14:59.060
You abandoned something that would have changed your life.

0:14:59.060,0:15:04.840
The business that would have changed you forever, you abandoned it because of attacks.

0:15:04.840,0:15:11.640
A friend that would have helped you, because of conflict, or trouble, you abandoned that friend.

0:15:11.640,0:15:24.100
Wives, a place that would have changed you forever, you stopped because of attacks and trouble.

0:15:24.140,0:15:30.300
Think about that. The enemy? Who is that enemy? You are the enemy of yourself.

0:15:30.340,0:15:35.100
Why can't I abandon the Synagogue Church of All Nations with all that has been happening to me?

0:15:35.140,0:15:40.400
How do you know what you are doing now is the right thing or where God wants you to be?

0:15:40.440,0:15:44.500
Don't try to make it easy for the devil.

0:15:44.500,0:15:47.800
You are making it easy for the devil.

0:15:47.800,0:15:53.180
Stay where you are!

0:15:53.180,0:15:56.200
Don't budge.

0:15:56.200,0:15:58.840
Stay where you are.

0:15:58.840,0:16:05.740
In times of great conflict, stay where you are!

0:16:05.740,0:16:08.800
Don't budge!

0:16:08.820,0:16:13.480
Don't make it easy for the devil.

0:16:13.480,0:16:16.760
You are making it easy for the devil.

0:16:16.760,0:16:20.760
You are making it so simple for the devil to get what he wants.

0:16:20.760,0:16:23.360
This is a common problem.

0:16:23.360,0:16:31.400
This is why we do not wait patiently for God's release.

0:16:31.400,0:16:35.520
Rather, it is trouble that releases us from the relationship.

0:16:35.520,0:16:38.760
It is trouble that releases us from our marriage.

0:16:38.760,0:16:43.280
It is trouble that releases us from our business partners.

0:16:43.280,0:16:47.500
Think back about your journey, then you will know.

0:16:47.520,0:16:54.600
We do not wait patiently for God's release in our regular relationships.

0:16:54.600,0:17:00.700
Rather, it is our circumstances that release us.

0:17:00.700,0:17:15.500
This is why we are always facing relationships that are neither lasting nor rewarding.

0:17:15.540,0:17:19.960
You cannot succeed alone;  you need people.

0:17:19.960,0:17:29.820
But to get good people, you must work through bad to get good.

0:17:29.820,0:17:33.700
My Bible made me to understand that when you are looking for good

0:17:33.700,0:17:36.760
you cannot find it just by mere stretching your hand.

0:17:36.760,0:17:43.320
My Bible made me to understand that you walk through bad, worse, bad, worse,

0:17:43.320,0:17:45.780
before you can find good.

0:17:45.780,0:17:49.060
This is why the Bible says: "find out the truth".

0:17:49.060,0:17:52.080
You must do some work before you can get the truth.

0:17:52.080,0:17:58.660
To get the truth you must get through alot before getting the truth.

0:17:58.660,0:18:02.420
Find out the truth and the truth shall set you free.

0:18:02.420,0:18:04.360
It does not say: "get the truth".

0:18:04.360,0:18:16.020
As Christian, we should see situations such as conflict, hurt,

0:18:16.420,0:18:25.740
all forms of offences as God's way to strengthen our character.

0:18:25.920,0:18:27.440
Tell your neighbour.

0:18:27.440,0:18:48.000
See situations such as conflicts, hurt, all forms of offenses as God's way to strengthen our character.

0:18:48.000,0:18:52.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:52.900,0:19:00.300
Situations should not release us from our regular relationships.

0:19:00.300,0:19:03.400
See what situations have done in your life.

0:19:03.400,0:19:06.120
It is the situation that destroyed your marriage.

0:19:06.120,0:19:09.680
The same situation that destroyed your business.

0:19:09.680,0:19:12.300
Because of fight, disagreement.

0:19:12.300,0:19:19.340
He is a thieve, foreigner, a criminal... This and that. He has duped you.

0:19:19.340,0:19:22.940
If he has duped you its not enough for you to leave the business.

0:19:24.500,0:19:30.900
Stay and get used to the situation – the situation will mature you.

0:19:30.900,0:19:38.340
Our situations are tests to mature us.

0:19:38.340,0:19:46.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service [claps]

0:19:46.820,0:19:50.820
Let go of your past.

0:19:50.960,0:19:55.560
Let go of this moment because another moment is coming.

0:19:55.740,0:20:00.060
If I am going this way, this direction

0:20:00.240,0:20:07.340
whatever I encounter on my way going, I should let go, because I am going to meet another moment.

0:20:07.340,0:20:09.560
Every moment, let go.

0:20:09.720,0:20:12.500
This moment when somebody slaps me

0:20:12.540,0:20:17.580
OK, I am not going to stay there, I am going forward, to another moment.

0:20:17.580,0:20:21.660
I should let go, so I can deal with this moment.

0:20:22.380,0:20:29.500
I am going, they see me going. What happens at this moment? Somebody hits me.

0:20:29.560,0:20:36.600
OK. Do I still want to go? If I still want to go forward, I should let go this moment,

0:20:36.620,0:20:41.260
because if I don't let this moment go, and I move to another moment;

0:20:41.260,0:20:47.100
and somebody slaps me, and I still carry this slap of yesterday today again, it means...

0:20:47.180,0:20:51.240
You know what it means when you have a carryover.

0:20:51.480,0:20:57.800
It is not a good thing, a carryover in your school assignment. It is a very bad thing.

0:20:57.880,0:21:01.580
Since you know you cannot succeed alone

0:21:01.580,0:21:07.400
you cannot do without a friend, you cannot do without a business partner. It is not possible

0:21:07.400,0:21:16.200
Even our Lord, Jesus Christ knew this; that is why He had 12 disciples.

0:21:16.200,0:21:19.320
He had His disciples and distributed assignments for them

0:21:19.320,0:21:22.520
because He knew He would not be able to succeed alone.

0:21:22.680,0:21:29.640
So, there is nothing you can do alone.

0:21:29.840,0:21:35.900
If there is anything you can do alone - let me know.

0:21:35.920,0:21:38.760
So, you need people.

0:21:39.220,0:21:42.100
When I say you need people, I mean you need good people.

0:21:42.200,0:21:48.140
But to get those good people you go through bad, before you get the good.

0:21:48.440,0:21:53.040
And if you are looking for that good, you do not want to deal with bad people

0:21:53.120,0:21:56.320
but just looking for good ones - you can never get it.

0:21:56.320,0:22:01.000
Because the Bible says: "find out".

0:22:01.000,0:22:09.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service.

0:22:09.620,0:22:16.520
No matter what are you going through in your relationship,

0:22:16.520,0:22:22.600
remember that relationship begins with God.

0:22:22.600,0:22:24.780
If the relationship begins with God,

0:22:25.020,0:22:30.420
it means no matter what you are going through, it should not release you from that relationship.

0:22:30.600,0:22:36.380
LET GOD RELEASE YOU

0:22:36.380,0:22:42.100
If you had been waiting patiently for God to release you all this while,

0:22:42.100,0:22:46.540
I know, the sky would have been your limit.

0:22:46.540,0:22:52.280
Many things you see as bad, behind the bad, there is good.

0:22:52.280,0:23:01.780
A friend you see as a bad guy, is the saviour God sent to rescue you tomorrow.

0:23:01.780,0:23:08.940
He may be bad today but tomorrow he is another person.

0:23:09.140,0:23:14.840
LET GOD RELEASE YOU

0:23:15.560,0:23:20.400
Let God what? (Church response): release you!

0:23:20.420,0:23:23.000
Look at many marriages today.

0:23:23.020,0:23:29.580
It was this great crisis or conflict that separated many marriages.

0:23:29.880,0:23:35.440
And yet, they have not met the loved one they were looking for.

0:23:35.440,0:23:46.320
Ask anyone who is in this situation and they will tell you that they are managing.

0:23:46.320,0:23:51.780
Tell your neighbour, "They are managing".

0:23:51.780,0:24:07.140
We are dealing not only with the hurt which took place in the new relationship

0:24:07.140,0:24:19.360
but also with the hurt from the former relationship.

0:24:19.360,0:24:30.500
Tell your neighbour: we are dealing not only with the hurt that took place in the new relationship

0:24:30.500,0:24:37.740
but with the hurt from the former relationship.

0:24:37.740,0:24:46.360
Two hurts – the way you left this relationship, the way you will enter the new relationship.

0:24:46.580,0:24:49.980
It is a carryover. That is life.

0:24:50.160,0:24:58.400
The hurt of the former relationship and the new one are together.

0:24:58.400,0:25:01.640
I know that you will be very surprised to hear this from me.

0:25:01.640,0:25:13.420
The business that would have turned you around, you abandoned it because of circumstances.

0:25:13.420,0:25:22.620
A friend that would have helped you in life, in the past, you abandoned because of adversities.

0:25:22.860,0:25:27.700
Can I ask a question?

0:25:27.700,0:25:30.320
How do we have a healthy relationship?

0:25:30.320,0:25:38.760
We know that it is impossible to establish a relationship with a person

0:25:38.760,0:25:45.560
who has left another relationship bitter and offended.

0:25:45.560,0:25:56.340
It is impossible to establish a relationship with a person

0:25:56.340,0:26:02.320
who has left another relationship bitter and offended.

0:26:02.320,0:26:07.160
How does this message appeal to you?

0:26:08.160,0:26:09.660
Thank you.

0:26:11.180,0:26:14.260
How does this message appeal to you Sir?

0:26:14.580,0:26:18.620
(Response): Usually there will be a lot of carryovers.

0:26:19.600,0:26:24.200
The temptations is always there to judge the new relationship

0:26:24.360,0:26:28.640
with the mistakes of the former relationship.

0:26:28.800,0:26:32.360
And this always brings bitterness.

0:26:32.840,0:26:35.460
Such things in fact, I witnessed a marriage,

0:26:35.460,0:26:39.640
where the new wife,

0:26:39.900,0:26:43.880
whatever she does, the husband always says

0:26:43.880,0:26:47.380
why are you behaving like this other woman again?

0:26:47.380,0:26:51.840
Always remembering the experiences of the past marriage.

0:26:51.840,0:26:54.600
It's like a multiplication of the effects.

0:26:54.600,0:26:58.320
It's not the best. That's my advice.

0:26:58.480,0:27:00.500
Thank you Sir.

0:27:00.540,0:27:02.540
Lets hear from you, Sir.

0:27:04.140,0:27:12.040
(Response): First of all, I must confess the sermon today is for me.

0:27:12.820,0:27:15.360
From the start to the end.

0:27:15.880,0:27:23.820
Yesterday I arrived from Sierra Leone and even before I came to the Synagogue, I have been praying.

0:27:23.820,0:27:26.760
Sometimes I tried to come but I didn't have time to come.

0:27:26.760,0:27:28.760
I had other engagements.

0:27:29.100,0:27:32.600
The marriage aspect has to do with me.

0:27:32.600,0:27:35.920
The business aspect has to do with me as well.

0:27:35.920,0:27:37.920
The business aspect is even recent.

0:27:40.020,0:27:50.300
The marriage aspect... I just want to say, from the time the man of God entered here,

0:27:50.340,0:27:56.600
what I asked God for is what he is telling me. So, I want to thank God.

0:27:56.660,0:28:02.960
It's really excruciating.

0:28:02.960,0:28:08.380
You cannot compare it to anything else in this world. Not even losing money.

0:28:08.700,0:28:13.580
When you lose a relationship you have strived so much to keep.

0:28:14.040,0:28:19.600
Clap for him. Thank you very much.

0:28:19.660,0:28:23.400
Lastly, which I want you to go over again.

0:28:23.400,0:28:34.800
Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,

0:28:34.800,0:28:49.320
the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging.

0:28:49.320,0:29:01.860
Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,

0:29:01.860,0:29:18.500
the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging.

0:29:18.500,0:29:22.300
How do we know that we have not forgiven?

0:29:22.340,0:29:24.340
You say you have forgiven.

0:29:24.440,0:29:28.740
But how do we know you have not yet forgiven?

0:29:28.740,0:29:31.620
In a little time, you will talk and refer to the issue.

0:29:31.620,0:29:44.420
You keep referring to your loss but you never refer to your gain.

0:29:44.420,0:29:51.120
we know you are harbouring an offence, without forgiveness.

0:29:51.120,0:29:59.020
Tell your neighbour: you keep referring to your loss; you never refer to your gain.

0:29:59.020,0:30:05.680
You keep referring to your failure; you never refer to your success.

0:30:05.680,0:30:14.000
Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,

0:30:14.000,0:30:24.000
the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centeredness and total caging.

0:30:24.000,0:30:34.000
Tell your neighbor: you keep referring to your loss; you never refer to your gain.
