LET GOD RELEASE YOU! POWERFUL MESSAGE BY PROPHET TB JOSHUA! EMMANUEL TV.

0:00:05.040,0:00:08.600
Good morning, church!

0:00:11.340,0:00:14.460
Hallelujah.

0:00:14.460,0:00:17.380
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:20.700,0:00:29.340
We shall talk about a very important issue - it has to do with relationships.

0:00:29.340,0:00:40.360
Natural, human relationships are very important.

0:00:40.360,0:00:43.860
That is why we are here today.

0:00:43.860,0:00:54.980
I am talking to you here and now because you are there, listening to me.

0:00:54.980,0:01:01.300
If you were not there, listening to me, I couldn't come here and be talking to the air.

0:01:01.300,0:01:09.120
Viewers at home, I say I am talking to you because I believe you are there listening,

0:01:09.120,0:01:11.820
paying attention to me.

0:01:11.820,0:01:14.240
I want to say thank you for that.

0:01:14.240,0:01:19.800
This is the message for today:
"LET GOD RELEASE YOU"

0:01:19.800,0:01:23.760
Tell your neighbour:
"Let God release you"

0:01:23.760,0:01:30.280
In your business...
In your relationships...

0:01:30.320,0:01:51.960
Regular relationships, such as marriage, business or even friendship, can break out of sheer circumstances -

0:01:51.960,0:01:56.080
just like that!

0:01:56.080,0:02:02.480
And the origin of relationship is God.

0:02:02.480,0:02:07.480
Until God releases us, we cannot quit the relationship.

0:02:07.480,0:02:10.960
But today, it does not take us anything!

0:02:10.960,0:02:22.200
Just disagreement, misunderstanding or conflict and we quit the relationship.

0:02:22.200,0:02:25.920
But you cannot do it alone.

0:02:25.920,0:02:34.200
You keep quitting relationships - business partners, marriage or friendships.

0:02:34.200,0:02:40.880
You move from one church to another just like that - it doesn't take you anything - without God releasing you.

0:02:40.880,0:02:48.320
When are we going to settle with relationships?

0:02:48.320,0:02:53.120
That is the question you need to ask yourself. When are you going to settle with a relationship?

0:02:53.120,0:03:06.960
You can count how many business partners you have had in the past, or friends.

0:03:06.960,0:03:20.440
And the Bible says that relationship begins with God, and then (it overflows) to humans.

0:03:20.440,0:03:30.120
Relationship begins with God, and then (it overflows) to humans.

0:03:30.120,0:03:40.680
If relationship begins with God, we cannot just quit from it due to  any circumstance.

0:03:40.680,0:03:49.680
Something where you are not the origin - you cannot just quit due to any circumstance.

0:03:49.680,0:04:00.000
Unless you are released, you cannot just quit from it.

0:04:00.000,0:04:06.480
And you know that God can speak through disagreement.

0:04:06.480,0:04:16.280
God can speak through conflict, through tribulation or adversity.

0:04:16.280,0:04:19.200
God can speak through them.

0:04:19.200,0:04:24.840
He can speak joy through sadness.

0:04:24.840,0:04:27.980
If God does not release us

0:04:28.480,0:04:44.560
and we quit the relationship because of disagreement, misunderstanding, conflict or whatever,

0:04:44.560,0:04:55.920
the way you quit is the way you will enter the next relationship.

0:04:55.920,0:04:57.760
Unless you are released...

0:04:57.760,0:05:05.320
We don't leave a relationship as a Christian because of fights, disagreement, conflict or adversity.

0:05:05.320,0:05:07.280
We don't leave relationships (in that way).

0:05:07.280,0:05:11.960
Because the man who is your enemy today can be your saviour tomorrow.

0:05:11.960,0:05:14.280
Look at many of you that are in the church today.

0:05:14.280,0:05:21.120
You know what you have said about this Ministry before now, or what you have done about this Ministry.

0:05:21.120,0:05:25.920
But today, you are here!

0:05:25.920,0:05:35.480
Let me quickly take you to the message from John chapter 20 verse 23.

0:05:35.480,0:05:47.880
"If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven".

0:05:47.880,0:05:59.480
What the Bible is saying here is that if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven,

0:05:59.480,0:06:07.640
but if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.

0:06:07.640,0:06:25.240
This means that we preserve the sins of other people when we pick up offence and harbour resentment.

0:06:25.240,0:06:35.120
It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship, a good relationship,

0:06:35.120,0:06:50.220
with a person who has left another relationship resentful and offended.

0:06:50.220,0:07:00.380
Someone who breaks a relationship because of misunderstanding or conflict now becomes your friend.

0:07:00.380,0:07:09.260
There is no friendship there; you are destroyed.

0:07:09.280,0:07:17.280
This is my brother; we are friends, but something happens and we start fighting.

0:07:17.280,0:07:20.940
"What happened? You are foolish!"

0:07:20.940,0:07:25.360
Maybe I am wrong or right, or you are wrong or right.

0:07:25.360,0:07:36.800
We have no right to go with that conflict    and establish another relationship.

0:07:36.800,0:07:45.200
If we now decide not to come together  , and I now have another friend here, this man is in trouble.

0:07:45.200,0:07:50.360
The relationship were were going to establish is purely disease, affliction,

0:07:50.360,0:07:58.360
because I have a broken relationship here, with misunderstanding and disagreement; it is unsettled.

0:07:58.360,0:08:03.960
But now you are my friend, and you too must have had your own somewhere before we came together.

0:08:03.960,0:08:18.280
Can you see why we are facing relationships that are neither lasting nor rewarding?

0:08:18.280,0:08:25.920
This is why you end up with relationships without reward.

0:08:25.920,0:08:32.680
Because you fight this one, you end the relationship and look for other friends.

0:08:32.680,0:08:42.900
Remember you carry conflict, hatred, bitterness, offence and become the friend of another person.

0:08:42.900,0:08:48.480
And that person too may also have a broken relationship somewhere.

0:08:48.480,0:08:53.680
The two of you are together....
Can you see the life you are living?

0:08:53.680,0:09:01.360
And you cannot succeed alone; you need people, you need friends.

0:09:01.360,0:09:10.240
Jesus knew this; that was why He had disciples.
He would not have been able to succeed alone.

0:09:10.240,0:09:15.280
It is impossible to establish a healthy, good relationship

0:09:15.280,0:09:24.160
with a person who has left another relationship bitter and offended.

0:09:24.160,0:09:30.880
(In this situation) you can never have a healthy or rewarding relationship.

0:09:30.880,0:09:42.800
This is why today when you see a broken home - a divorced woman or man marry someone else,

0:09:42.800,0:09:47.840
they will still  also divorce, at least 90% of them,

0:09:47.840,0:09:55.680
because of the carry over they have, where they are coming from.

0:09:55.680,0:10:07.720
If God releases you, you will not be under pressure to judge.

0:10:07.720,0:10:19.240
To be under pressure is to be under the control of our circumstances,

0:10:19.240,0:10:29.800
allowing situations to control, mislead and overwhelm us.

0:10:29.800,0:10:38.960
If you are released, you will go with joy, even in the face of adversity.

0:10:38.960,0:10:46.560
As a good example, you know that attending church is a thing of God.

0:10:46.560,0:10:56.520
But today... Someone just brought you here today, someone just told you there are miracles here.

0:10:56.520,0:10:58.240
That is why you are here.

0:10:58.240,0:11:05.040
Or someone just told you that a woman you have been looking for for many years is attending this church.

0:11:05.040,0:11:06.920
That is why you are here today.

0:11:06.920,0:11:13.240
Or someone just told you that your Chairman is a member of this church - that is why you are here today.

0:11:13.240,0:11:18.360
Or someone just told you that the man you are looking for a contract from is a member of this church

0:11:18.360,0:11:20.200
That is why you are here today.

0:11:20.200,0:11:26.840
Attending church is a thing of God.

0:11:26.840,0:11:34.160
When we go to church, we are answering God's invitation.

0:11:34.160,0:11:43.600
Do not leave due to any circumstance, because it is God's invitation.

0:11:43.600,0:11:55.920
Don't pull out of the church or a relationship due to any circumstance

0:11:55.920,0:12:10.840
such as disagreement, misunderstanding or taking offences, whether you are right or wrong.

0:12:10.840,0:12:21.280
We should let God release us.

0:12:21.280,0:12:27.440
If God releases you then even in the face of crisis you will go with joy.

0:12:27.440,0:12:35.960
In the Book of Isaiah 55 verse 12, it says you will go with joy.

0:12:35.960,0:12:51.600
Every Christian should realise that where God wants them to be, the devil will want to offend them to pull out.

0:12:51.600,0:13:07.640
If you are in a place where God wants you to be, the devil will want to offend you to pull out.

0:13:07.640,0:13:17.240
The devil is always interested in where God wants you to be, where God wants you to go,

0:13:17.240,0:13:24.240
where God wants you to sit and what God wants you to say.

0:13:24.240,0:13:29.960
Any time you wake up and you are going to your business and you start receiving attack,

0:13:29.960,0:13:34.000
or something happens like an accident - don't give up, go there.

0:13:34.000,0:13:40.280
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:13:40.280,0:13:48.840
If your relationship with your wife or your friend is being attacked, or if your business is being attacked so much,

0:13:48.840,0:13:54.640
know that that is where God wants you to be.

0:13:54.640,0:14:10.000
If you are in a place where God wants you, the devil will want to offend you to pull out.

0:14:10.000,0:14:16.760
You have abandoned a business that would have put you on the world map, because of attacks.

0:14:16.760,0:14:22.640
You have abandoned a relationship that would have built your future and career, because of attacks.

0:14:22.640,0:14:26.280
You have abandoned...

0:14:26.280,0:14:33.080
Think of the many things you have abandoned because of attacks and threats to your life.

0:14:33.080,0:14:37.640
A business that would have put you on the world map, you abandoned it.

0:14:37.640,0:14:44.720
Because of so much debt, so much loss, you abandon it.

0:14:44.720,0:14:55.040
That is what God wants you to do! The devil knows; that is why he is attacking you.

0:14:55.040,0:14:59.040
You abandoned something that would have changed your life.

0:14:59.040,0:15:04.880
The business that would have changed you forever, you abandoned it because of attacks.

0:15:04.880,0:15:11.480
A friend that would have helped you, you abandoned them because of conflict or trouble.

0:15:11.480,0:15:24.320
Wives, a place that would have changed you forever, you stopped because of attacks and trouble.

0:15:24.320,0:15:26.280
Think about that.

0:15:26.280,0:15:30.640
Enemy? Who is that enemy? You are the enemy of yourself.

0:15:30.640,0:15:35.240
Why can't I abandon The Synagogue, Church of All Nations with what has been happening to me?

0:15:35.240,0:15:40.560
How do you know that what you are doing now is the right thing, where God wants you to be?

0:15:40.560,0:15:44.760
Don't try to make it easy for the devil.

0:15:44.760,0:15:47.800
You are making it easy for the devil.

0:15:47.800,0:15:56.200
Stay where you are! Don't budge!

0:15:56.200,0:15:58.880
Stay where you are.

0:15:58.880,0:16:09.000
In times of great conflict, stay where you are, don't budge.

0:16:09.000,0:16:13.600
Don't make it easy for the devil.

0:16:13.600,0:16:16.840
You are making it easy for the devil.

0:16:16.840,0:16:20.760
You are making it so simple for the devil to get what he wants.

0:16:20.760,0:16:31.640
These are common problems. This is why we do not wait patiently for God's release.

0:16:31.640,0:16:35.920
Rather, it is trouble that releases us from relationships.

0:16:35.920,0:16:43.160
It is trouble that releases us from our marriage; it is trouble that releases us from our business partner.

0:16:43.160,0:16:47.480
Think back over your journey. You will know...

0:16:47.480,0:16:54.520
We do not wait patiently for God's release in our regular relationships.

0:16:54.520,0:17:01.120
Rather, it is our circumstances that release us

0:17:01.120,0:17:15.560
This is why we are always facing relationships that are neither lasting nor rewarding.

0:17:15.560,0:17:20.320
You cannot succeed alone; you need people.

0:17:20.320,0:17:30.000
But to get good people, you must work through bad to get good.

0:17:30.000,0:17:33.440
My Bible makes me to understand that when you are looking for good,

0:17:33.440,0:17:36.640
you can't just find it by merely stretching your hand.

0:17:36.640,0:17:45.960
My Bible makes me to understand that you go through bad, worse, bad, worse, before you can find good.

0:17:45.960,0:17:49.160
This is why the Bible says, "find out the truth".

0:17:49.160,0:17:52.120
You must do some work before you can get the truth.

0:17:52.120,0:17:58.920
To get the truth, you must go through wrong and falsehood before getting to the truth.

0:17:58.920,0:18:02.800
Find out the truth and the truth will set you free.

0:18:02.800,0:18:04.720
It doesn't say, "get the truth"

0:18:04.720,0:18:20.400
As Christians, we should see situations such as conflict, hurt or all forms of offences

0:18:20.400,0:18:26.080
as God's way to strengthen our character.

0:18:26.080,0:18:39.600
Tell your neighbour, "see situations such as conflict, hurt or all forms of offences

0:18:39.600,0:18:52.800
as God's way to strengthen our character."

0:18:52.800,0:19:00.720
Situations should not release us from our regular relationships.

0:19:00.720,0:19:03.520
See what situations have done in your life.

0:19:03.520,0:19:09.840
It was the situation that destroyed your marriage, the same situation that destroyed your business.

0:19:09.840,0:19:15.760
Because of fights, disagreements, "he's a thief!", "he's a fraudster!", "he's a criminal!"

0:19:15.760,0:19:24.600
You receive a phone call, "he has duped you!" If he dupes you, it is not enough for you to leave the business.

0:19:24.600,0:19:31.160
Stay and get used to the situation. The situation will mature you.

0:19:31.160,0:19:37.160
Our situations are tests to mature us.

0:19:46.880,0:19:51.360
Let go of your past.

0:19:51.360,0:19:55.880
Let go of this moment because another moment is coming.

0:19:55.880,0:20:04.840
If I am going in this direction, whatever I encounter on my way I should let go

0:20:04.840,0:20:07.600
because I am going to meet another moment.

0:20:07.600,0:20:09.960
Every moment, let go.

0:20:09.960,0:20:17.440
At this moment somebody slaps me. OK, I'm not going to stay there, I am going forward to another moment.

0:20:17.440,0:20:23.560
I should let go so that I can deal with this (next) moment.

0:20:23.560,0:20:26.800
I'm moving forward. Yes, see me going.

0:20:26.800,0:20:30.400
At this moment, what happened? Somebody hit me.

0:20:30.400,0:20:36.640
OK, if I still want to move forward, I should let go of this moment.

0:20:36.640,0:20:42.800
Because if I don't let this moment go and I move to another moment and somebody slaps me again,

0:20:42.800,0:20:51.320
and I am still carrying this slap of yesterday - you know what it means when you have a "carry over" -

0:20:51.320,0:20:58.040
it is not a good thing. Carry over in your school is a very bad thing.

0:20:58.040,0:21:04.320
You know you cannot succeed alone, you cannot do without friends,

0:21:04.320,0:21:07.960
you cannot do without business partners - it is not possible.

0:21:07.960,0:21:16.520
Even our Lord Jesus Christ knew this; that was why he had twelve disciples.

0:21:16.520,0:21:19.640
He had his disciples and distributed assignments to them

0:21:19.640,0:21:22.760
because He knew He would not be able to succeed alone.

0:21:22.760,0:21:30.000
So also you, there is nothing you can do alone.

0:21:30.000,0:21:36.240
There is nothing. If there is anything you can do alone, let me know.

0:21:36.240,0:21:42.080
So, you need people - I mean you need good people.

0:21:42.080,0:21:48.480
But to get those good people, you go through bad, bad, bad before you get the good.

0:21:48.480,0:21:56.220
If you are looking for good and you don't want to deal with bad people, you can never get it -

0:21:56.220,0:22:00.020
because the Bible says, "Find out..."

0:22:09.680,0:22:16.720
No matter what you are going through in your relationship,

0:22:16.720,0:22:22.760
remember - that relationship begins with God.

0:22:22.760,0:22:27.440
If the relationship begins with God, it means that no matter what you are going through,

0:22:27.440,0:22:30.480
it should not release you from that relationship.

0:22:30.480,0:22:33.400
Let God release you.

0:22:36.560,0:22:42.400
If you had been waiting patiently for God to release you all this while,

0:22:42.400,0:22:46.920
I know that the sky would have been your limit.

0:22:46.920,0:22:52.560
Many things you see as bad, behind the bad there is good.

0:22:52.560,0:23:02.120
A friend you see as a bad guy is the saviour God sent to rescue you tomorrow.

0:23:02.120,0:23:09.400
He may be bad today, but tomorrow he is another person.

0:23:09.400,0:23:20.760
Let God release you.

Look at many marriages today. It was this great crisis or conflict that separated many of them.

0:23:30.120,0:23:35.760
Yet they have still not met the loved one they are looking for.

0:23:35.760,0:23:46.400
Ask anyone who is in this situation and they will tell you that they are merely managing.

0:23:46.400,0:23:51.960
Tell your neighbour, "They are managing".

0:23:51.960,0:24:07.600
We are dealing not only with the hurt that took place in the new relationship,

0:24:07.600,0:24:19.680
but also with the hurt from the former relationship.

0:24:19.680,0:24:30.800
Tell your neighbour, "We are dealing not only with the hurt that took place in the new relationship,

0:24:30.800,0:24:38.000
but also with the hurt from the former relationship."

0:24:38.000,0:24:46.720
Two hurts - the way you left this relationship and the way you will enter the new relationship.

0:24:46.720,0:24:50.400
It is a carry over. That is life.

0:24:50.400,0:24:58.480
The hurt of the former relationship and the new one, all together.

0:24:58.480,0:25:01.600
I know you will be very surprised to hear this from me:

0:25:01.600,0:25:13.680
The business that would have turned you around, you abandoned it because of circumstances.

0:25:13.680,0:25:22.800
A friend who would have helped you in life, in the past, you abandoned because of adversaries.

0:25:22.800,0:25:28.080
Can I ask a question?

0:25:28.080,0:25:30.560
How do we have a healthy relationship?

0:25:30.560,0:25:39.120
We know that it is impossible to establish a relationship with a person

0:25:39.120,0:25:45.760
who has left another relationship bitter and offended.

0:25:45.760,0:26:02.800
It is impossible to establish a relationship with a person who has left another relationship bitter and offended.

0:26:02.800,0:26:11.040
How does this message appeal to you?
Thank you.

0:26:11.040,0:26:14.480
How does this message appeal to you, sir?

0:26:14.480,0:26:21.280
Usually, there will be a lot of carry over and the temptation is always there

0:26:21.280,0:26:28.560
to judge the new relationship with the mistakes of the former relationship.

0:26:28.560,0:26:33.760
This always brings up bitterness.

0:26:33.760,0:26:44.400
In fact I witnessed a marriage where the new wife, whatever she does, the husband always refers back,

0:26:44.400,0:26:52.000
"Why are you behaving like this other woman?" Always remembering the experiences of the past marriage.

0:26:52.000,0:26:58.800
It was like a multiplication of the effect.
This is not always the best.

0:26:58.800,0:27:04.160
Thank you. OK, let's hear from you, sir.

0:27:04.160,0:27:16.000
First I must confess that the sermon today was for me, from the start to the end.

0:27:16.000,0:27:23.600
Yesterday, I arrived from Sierra Leone. Even before coming to The Synagogue, I have been praying.

0:27:23.600,0:27:29.440
I had previously set my time to come but didn't have time to come because of other engagements.

0:27:29.440,0:27:36.080
The marriage aspect, it has to do with me. The business aspect, it has to do with me as well.

0:27:36.080,0:27:39.520
And the business aspect is even recent.

0:27:39.520,0:27:50.320
Concerning the marriage aspect, I just want to say that from the time the man of God entered here,

0:27:50.320,0:27:56.480
what I asked God for is what he is telling me, so I want to thank God.

0:27:56.480,0:28:08.720
You know it is really excruciating - you cannot compare it to anything else in this world, even losing money -

0:28:08.720,0:28:14.960
when you lose a relationship you have strived so much to keep.

0:28:14.960,0:28:19.680
Thank you, clap for him. Thank you very much brother.

0:28:19.680,0:28:35.120
Lastly - I want you to go over it again - harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,

0:28:35.120,0:28:49.680
the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging.

0:28:49.680,0:29:02.080
Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,

0:29:02.080,0:29:18.800
the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging.

0:29:18.800,0:29:22.480
How do we know that we have not forgiven?

0:29:22.480,0:29:28.880
You say you have forgiven, but how do we know you have not yet forgiven?

0:29:28.880,0:29:31.760
The little time you talk, you refer to the issue.

0:29:31.760,0:29:39.440
You keep referring to your loss, but you never refer to your gain.

0:29:39.440,0:29:44.720
You keep referring to your loss, but you will never refer to your gain.

0:29:44.720,0:29:51.520
We know you are harbouring offence, without forgiveness.

0:29:51.520,0:29:59.440
Tell your neighbour, "You keep referring to your loss; you never refer to your gain.

0:29:59.440,0:30:06.320
You keep referring to your failure; you never refer to your success.

0:30:06.320,0:30:14.000
Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,

0:30:14.000,0:30:24.640
the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging."
