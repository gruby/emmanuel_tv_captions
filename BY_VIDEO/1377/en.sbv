I know your song is always in your heart - 'Sin's Power'.

0:00:07.880,0:00:10.960
Can we rise up and sing?

0:00:10.960,0:00:23.000
Sin's power over me is broken

0:00:23.000,0:00:33.560
Sin's power over us is broken

0:00:33.560,0:00:46.240
When Jesus rose I rose
When He rose we rose

0:00:46.240,0:00:57.400
Sin's power over us is broken

0:00:57.400,0:01:08.540
Sin's power over me is broken

0:01:08.540,0:01:17.940
Sin's power over us is broken

0:01:17.940,0:01:30.100
When Jesus went I went
When He went I went

0:01:30.100,0:01:39.980
Sin's power over us is broken

0:01:39.980,0:01:42.960
That is your secret.

0:01:42.960,0:01:48.120
Sin's power - you know what sin brings.

0:01:48.120,0:01:57.140
When you say, "Sin's power over me", it means tribulation, affliction, setback -

0:01:57.140,0:02:06.860
just mention any foolish thing - broken!

0:02:06.860,0:02:08.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:08.940,0:02:12.520
You must mean it when you sing it.

0:02:12.520,0:02:16.440
This is what you should sing before sleeping.

0:02:16.440,0:02:20.720
And when you are going, this should be in your heart.

0:02:20.720,0:02:23.160
Meditation.

0:02:23.160,0:02:26.620
As you are looking at me, that song should be going on in your heart.

0:02:26.620,0:02:28.620
It should go on in your heart.

0:02:28.620,0:02:36.620
It is well anointed to secure you for the glory.

0:02:36.620,0:02:38.240
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:02:38.240,0:02:41.140
Hallelujah.

0:02:41.140,0:02:51.120
If God's Word finds its place in your heart, let me see your joy.

0:02:51.120,0:02:55.800
That is why we are here; that is the most important thing -

0:02:55.800,0:02:59.620
God's Word must find its place in your heart.

0:02:59.620,0:03:07.220
God's Word in your heart heals, blesses, saves, brings Jesus to the scene.

0:03:07.220,0:03:10.980
Tell your neighbour, "God's Word in my heart".

0:03:10.980,0:03:12.060
I can't hear you.

0:03:12.060,0:03:13.580
[God's Word in my heart.]

0:03:13.580,0:03:14.660
I can't hear you.

0:03:14.660,0:03:16.060
[God's Word in my heart.]

0:03:16.060,0:03:17.380
Again and again.

0:03:17.380,0:03:18.940
[God's Word in my heart.]

0:03:18.940,0:03:26.580
Listen to that word 'heart' because Christianity lies in the heart.

0:03:26.580,0:03:35.000
Heart - the real man, the man himself.

0:03:35.000,0:03:37.620
Tell your neighbour, "Heart".

0:03:37.620,0:03:38.440
I can't hear you.

0:03:38.440,0:03:39.120
[Heart.]

0:03:39.120,0:03:41.180
Face your neighbour.

0:03:41.180,0:03:49.000
Heart - the real man, the man himself.

0:03:49.000,0:03:52.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:52.600,0:04:14.920
Inner my heart

0:04:14.920,0:04:33.520
Lord I want to be like Jesus
Inner my heart

0:04:33.520,0:04:34.720
Listen to that.

0:04:34.720,0:04:48.640
Lord I want to be like Jesus
Inner my heart

0:04:48.640,0:05:01.160
Not, "Lord I want to be like Jesus in my face".

0:05:01.160,0:05:06.960
Your face can be oblong or round; that is not an issue.

0:05:06.960,0:05:12.160
You must be like Jesus in your heart.

0:05:12.160,0:05:19.220
That is why faith is of man's heart because only faith pleases God.

0:05:19.220,0:05:21.260
See what you have been doing since morning.

0:05:21.260,0:05:28.820
Prayer is a work of faith; fasting is a work of faith.

0:05:28.820,0:05:34.880
Humility is a work of faith; faithfulness is a work of faith.

0:05:34.880,0:05:39.940
Kindness is a work of faith; obedience is a work of faith.

0:05:39.940,0:05:43.500
Only faith pleases God.

0:05:43.500,0:05:51.060
The real man - the man himself.

0:05:51.060,0:05:55.880
If I'm talking to you and not your heart, I'm not talking to you.

0:05:55.880,0:06:02.620
When you are talking to me not from your heart, I will not be able to help you.

0:06:02.620,0:06:07.920
If what you are saying is not from your heart, I will not be able to help you.

0:06:07.920,0:06:14.260
I'm a man of heart; I must talk to the man of heart.

0:06:14.260,0:06:18.760
Heart! Heart!
Heart to heart!

0:06:18.760,0:06:24.280
Are you here - your heart, your real man?

0:06:24.280,0:06:29.060
Ask your neighbour, "Are you here - your heart?"

0:06:29.060,0:06:30.320
I can't hear you.

0:06:30.320,0:06:33.240
[Are you here - your heart?]

0:06:33.240,0:06:40.540
Our presence here today is all about identification -

0:06:40.540,0:06:49.640
to identify and acknowledge our weakness.

0:06:49.640,0:07:01.740
To identify and acknowledge our weakness is victory itself.

0:07:01.740,0:07:08.820
You say, "Ah, I'm here because I'm a smoker".

0:07:08.820,0:07:11.060
"I'm here because I'm a liar."

0:07:11.060,0:07:14.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:14.220,0:07:18.600
"I'm here because I'm a thief."

0:07:18.600,0:07:31.260
To identify and acknowledge your weakness is victory itself.

0:07:31.260,0:07:38.660
Take note - it is 50 percent of the victory.

0:07:38.660,0:07:41.460
"I'm a smoker; I don't want to smoke any longer.

0:07:41.460,0:07:47.400
Jesus, help me. That is why I'm here.

0:07:47.400,0:07:50.560
I don't want to smoke any longer."

0:07:50.560,0:07:59.920
It is 50 percent of the victory; the remaining 50 percent, leave it for God.

0:07:59.920,0:08:07.240
Right now, begin to identify where you need to improve.

0:08:07.240,0:08:11.840
Ask your neighbour, "Where do you need to improve?"

0:08:11.840,0:08:18.600
Whatever blessing you have received in terms of miracle or healing cannot be permanent;

0:08:18.600,0:08:21.880
it is our weakness that robs us.

0:08:21.880,0:08:27.020
That is what satan will use to take away the blessing you have received.

0:08:27.020,0:08:37.840
That weakness is the route satan will take to snatch away the blessing you have received.

0:08:37.840,0:08:43.640
Ask your neighbour, "Where do you need to improve?"

0:08:43.640,0:08:45.180
Ask your neighbour again.

0:08:45.180,0:08:46.980
[Where do you need to improve?]

0:08:46.980,0:08:48.180
I can't hear you.

0:08:48.180,0:08:50.060
[Where do you need to improve?]

0:08:50.060,0:08:51.120
Ask your neighbour.

0:08:51.120,0:08:53.120
[Where do you need to improve?]

0:08:53.120,0:09:01.740
Where do you need to improve in order to have a permanent miracle, a miracle forever?

0:09:01.740,0:09:09.500
If not, your life will continue to be epileptic - up, down.

0:09:09.500,0:09:16.400
Yesterday, you were once rich; today, you are on the street.

0:09:16.400,0:09:25.180
Yesterday, you were once healthy; today, you are very sick.

0:09:25.180,0:09:39.260
Satan uses our weakness as a route to get us, to snatch the one we have from God.

0:09:39.260,0:09:46.300
You know what it means: when you were alright yesterday and today is the opposite.

0:09:46.300,0:09:49.520
You lived at peace yesterday; but today - opposite.

0:09:49.520,0:09:52.380
You know what it means.

0:09:52.380,0:09:54.380
There is a song you sing.

0:09:54.380,0:10:00.180
It shall be permanent

0:10:00.180,0:10:06.020
What the Lord has done for me
It shall be permanent

0:10:06.020,0:10:13.860
No, it cannot be permanent if you don't block that weakness - the route satan uses to get to you.

0:10:13.860,0:10:19.560
He uses that route to get to you - the route, your weakness.

0:10:19.560,0:10:26.820
It is the route, road satan uses to get to you.

0:10:26.820,0:10:32.400
Identify where you need to grow, where you need to improve.
