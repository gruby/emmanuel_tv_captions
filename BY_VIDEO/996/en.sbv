0:00:00.000,0:00:01.160
Can I talk to you?

0:00:01.160,0:00:02.860
Who is this to you?

0:00:02.860,0:00:04.600
This is your wife.

0:00:04.600,0:00:08.600
You were with a woman in the past and she disappointed you.

0:00:08.600,0:00:09.440
Yes, sir.

0:00:09.440,0:00:11.000
Before you had this woman.

0:00:11.000,0:00:11.920
Yes, sir.

0:00:11.920,0:00:14.740
What happened now; it has started now – it is an attack.

0:00:14.740,0:00:15.500
It’s true, sir.

0:00:15.500,0:00:17.500
When you married this lady, “My honey, my honey”.

0:00:17.500,0:00:19.140
Now the affection is not there any more.

0:00:19.140,0:00:19.760
It's true, sir.

0:00:19.760,0:00:22.920
When you people sit together, people will think you are husband and wife – no affection.

0:00:22.920,0:00:23.720
It's true, sir.

0:00:23.720,0:00:26.600
This woman doesn’t even want you to touch her.

0:00:26.600,0:00:27.380
It's true, sir.

0:00:27.380,0:00:30.280
When you sleep, in the night you will wake up and go sit on the chair.

0:00:30.280,0:00:33.540
It's true, sir.

0:00:33.540,0:00:37.320
Prophecy Time

0:00:37.320,0:00:38.720
I want to see you.

0:00:38.720,0:00:40.300
Go and wait for me.

0:00:40.300,0:00:43.120
My name is Mr Chijioke Nwafor

0:00:43.120,0:00:47.440
The lady standing by me is my wife - Mrs Nwafor.

0:00:47.440,0:00:54.120
We came from Anambra State but we are based in Ekiti State, Nigeria.

0:00:54.120,0:00:58.240
Last Sunday, the man of God gave us prophecy.

0:00:58.240,0:01:05.500
He said it was God that saved me, that he saw me with a woman in the past who disappointed me.

0:01:05.500,0:01:10.220
He said what happened to me with that lady in the past is happening in my marriage now,

0:01:10.220,0:01:18.000
that there was no affection in my marriage which was an attack.

0:01:18.000,0:01:19.900
So, I confirm the prophecy to be true.

0:01:19.900,0:01:26.420
She used to tell me that she wants to quit the marriage; we always fight and quarrel.

0:01:26.420,0:01:28.520
Because you don't want her to leave the marriage?

0:01:28.520,0:01:30.240
I don’t want her to leave the marriage.

0:01:30.240,0:01:31.940
Can you see now?

0:01:31.940,0:01:37.460
She wants to leave the marriage and the husband keeps portraying,

0:01:37.460,0:01:41.480
"What do you want me to do? You want me to cook for you today? I will cook for you.

0:01:41.480,0:01:46.060
You want me to wash your things? I'm ready to wash your clothes."

0:01:46.060,0:01:51.680
He has been washing, cooking, doing everything - yet, she still wanted to leave the marriage.

0:01:51.680,0:01:57.840
"What else do you want me to do? OK, I will carry you to America for holiday - New York.

0:01:57.840,0:02:08.300
After New York we go to London. After London we go to Africa..."

0:02:08.300,0:02:09.300
I don't know.

0:02:09.300,0:02:12.840
OK, now - I want to quit the marriage.

0:02:12.840,0:02:20.400
... because love is from the heart.

0:02:20.400,0:02:27.200
Listen to that: she says she wants to quit the marriage after everything he had done.

0:02:27.200,0:02:32.140
What is the solution?

0:02:32.140,0:02:33.540
Let's listen.

0:02:33.540,0:02:36.200
My name is Mrs Ebere Nwafor.

0:02:36.200,0:02:38.860
The man standing beside me is my husband.

0:02:38.860,0:02:43.760
We came from the Anambra State but we reside in the Ekiti State, Nigeria.

0:02:43.760,0:02:50.900
I am a 500 level student of Nnamdi Azikwe University in Akwa.

0:02:50.900,0:02:55.520
We have been married for the past one year.

0:02:55.520,0:03:03.760
Although I know my husband’s weakness, at a point, I had to call him and sit him down.

0:03:03.760,0:03:07.040
I told him the areas he was having weakness

0:03:07.040,0:03:12.200
and said we needed to build ourselves up together as one family.

0:03:12.200,0:03:16.960
The problem is all about his appearance; I want to start from there.

0:03:16.960,0:03:23.020
His appearance does not attract me, although I saw that before I married him.

0:03:23.020,0:03:27.280
What attracted me before I married him was his humility and simplicity.

0:03:27.280,0:03:33.100
I thought that if I entered the marriage, I would be able to mould him to my taste.

0:03:33.100,0:03:38.020
At a point, when we were together, I had to tell my husband that his appearance

0:03:38.020,0:03:40.100
was not as it supposed to be.

0:03:40.100,0:03:48.020
I told him he was only 35 years old but he dressed like someone who was 70.

0:03:48.020,0:03:52.840
I had to be sincere with him, told him to adjust and promised to help him.

0:03:52.840,0:03:54.460
No one is perfect.

0:03:54.460,0:03:58.580
I said I would mould him to my taste and he too would mould me to his own taste.

0:03:58.580,0:04:06.580
However, after we had planned everything, he would take a decision on his own.

0:04:06.580,0:04:10.320
At times, when he wanted to visit me in school, I would have to call him on the phone

0:04:10.320,0:04:15.620
and tell him what he had to wear because my friends were around.

0:04:15.620,0:04:18.120
I told him that he had to look good.

0:04:18.120,0:04:24.340
All these are the things which I experienced in marriage which I don’t like or want.

0:04:24.340,0:04:30.420
When you were about to get married, was he dressing like this?

0:04:30.420,0:04:36.120
He was not actually dressing like this but after the marriage, everything became worse.

0:04:36.120,0:04:38.820
His dressing does not attract me.

0:04:38.820,0:04:43.680
But before the marriage his look was very good?

0:04:43.680,0:04:46.360
He looked more attractive before I married him.

0:04:46.360,0:04:47.740
- OK.
- Yes.

0:04:47.740,0:04:49.520
Listen to that to learn a lesson.

0:04:49.520,0:04:55.440
Those who want to get married - you should dress well, rest...

0:04:55.440,0:05:01.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:01.360,0:05:04.840
After the marriage, no more gym.

0:05:04.840,0:05:07.000
The question now is...

0:05:07.000,0:05:10.880
Many of you are here today.

0:05:10.880,0:05:19.820
The posh car you were using when you wanted to get married - where is it after the marriage?

0:05:19.820,0:05:24.680
Does it mean you hired it?

0:05:24.680,0:05:26.120
This is what we are talking about.

0:05:26.120,0:05:30.180
Listen to her, she is making a point, as well as the gentleman.

0:05:30.180,0:05:32.800
We are here to learn.

0:05:32.800,0:05:42.420
Man of God, even in the aspect of his body, I have begged my husband to exercise himself.

0:05:42.420,0:05:44.920
You asked him to do exercise?

0:05:44.920,0:05:45.760
- Yes.
- OK.

0:05:45.760,0:05:46.920
I want him to...

0:05:46.920,0:05:48.860
Clap for her.

0:05:48.860,0:05:53.080
Mr & Mrs Chijioke Nwafor
Prophecy Confirmation

0:05:53.080,0:06:00.100
It has really affected my affection for him because after everything, he would agree to do it

0:06:00.100,0:06:02.860
but at the end of the day, he wouldn’t do it.

0:06:02.860,0:06:09.220
Later on, he would come back to me and start begging me to forgive him but I wouldn’t be happy within me.

0:06:09.220,0:06:12.440
I want him to go and do what will bring peace in the house

0:06:12.440,0:06:16.200
because whenever I look at him, I am not proud of him.

0:06:16.200,0:06:23.680
I want my husband to look good; it is my job to treat him in the way I should but he is not responding.

0:06:23.680,0:06:25.060
That is my problem.

0:06:25.060,0:06:27.120
Thank you.

0:06:27.120,0:06:35.380
But unless the prophecy had come at this time, you would have left the marriage.

0:06:35.380,0:06:37.960
Man of God, I must be sincere; I don’t want to leave the marriage.

0:06:37.960,0:06:40.140
OK, but you threatened that you wanted to leave?

0:06:40.140,0:06:42.660
Yes, but it’s not from my mind.

0:06:42.660,0:06:44.700
I don’t want to leave my marriage.

0:06:44.700,0:06:47.880
OK, thank you for all this.

0:06:47.880,0:06:51.040
I don't need to ask my brother, whatever...

0:06:51.040,0:06:57.100
Thank God you have mentioned his age.

0:06:57.100,0:07:04.040
The answer you gave me at first - we disagree with it - by saying that you just threatened your husband

0:07:04.040,0:07:08.120
about leaving the marriage.

0:07:08.120,0:07:12.200
We cannot live above our word.

0:07:12.200,0:07:16.100
That is - you cannot live above your word.

0:07:16.100,0:07:18.320
Yes.

0:07:18.320,0:07:23.300
Satan uses our words to strike.

0:07:23.300,0:07:30.500
When you say, "I want to die...", you will soon die.

0:07:30.500,0:07:36.420
If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.

0:07:36.420,0:07:45.840
What you say out and is in compliance with satan to make it work, "I want to die..." - that is the word of satan -

0:07:45.840,0:07:50.300
satan will come and catch you.

0:07:50.300,0:07:57.460
"I want to leave my marriage..." - you will see people around and your husband saying it.

0:07:57.460,0:08:02.940
There will be people around to get you out of the marriage.

0:08:02.940,0:08:08.780
What we are saying now is: love is a thing of the heart.

0:08:08.780,0:08:19.980
We know that there is also a need to look good but the major love is a thing of what?

0:08:19.980,0:08:20.680
(Heart.)

0:08:20.680,0:08:23.240
... is a thing of heart.

0:08:23.240,0:08:25.000
Love is a thing of what?

0:08:25.000,0:08:25.720
(Heart.)

0:08:25.720,0:08:27.380
It is a thing of heart.

0:08:27.380,0:08:34.900
Even if your husband dresses now properly and put on the most expensive things -

0:08:34.900,0:08:39.100
that love, we are talking about, might not come back any more.

0:08:39.100,0:08:43.080
If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.

0:08:43.080,0:08:47.500
Even the man raises up his hand.

0:08:47.500,0:08:51.960
Clap for Jesus.

0:08:51.960,0:08:56.300
Let's assume, my friend - maybe his stomach is big.

0:08:56.300,0:08:58.840
It is one of the reasons even if she doesn't want to say that.

0:08:58.840,0:09:07.980
She wants him to have a flat one that will look good.

0:09:07.980,0:09:11.280
She wants him to wear most expensive clothes.

0:09:11.280,0:09:14.860
That love may not be there.

0:09:14.860,0:09:19.200
Those things cannot bring love.

0:09:19.200,0:09:23.780
Appearance cannot bring the love we are talking about.

0:09:23.780,0:09:28.940
Appearance cannot give birth to the love we call marriage.

0:09:28.940,0:09:37.500
Tell your neighbour: "There are loves but the love we call marriage - appearance does not produce it".

0:09:37.500,0:09:47.620
Tell your neighbour, "There are so many loves but the love we call marriage - appearance does not give it".

0:09:47.620,0:09:52.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:52.880,0:09:58.080
If appearance gives marriage - that marriage cannot stand the test of time.

0:09:58.080,0:10:03.680
In a short time crisis or hardship will destroy the marriage.

0:10:03.680,0:10:06.020
By appearance...

0:10:06.020,0:10:12.860
The love we talk about is love of God.

0:10:12.860,0:10:18.740
If appearance is the basis of our marriage or relationship -

0:10:18.740,0:10:24.560
such relationship cannot stand the test of time.

0:10:24.560,0:10:29.720
Let us look at where the problem is coming from.

0:10:29.720,0:10:33.660
Does this marriage come from God?

0:10:33.660,0:10:36.000
What is the problem?

0:10:36.000,0:10:46.200
If I now say that my brother should go to gym, see doctor, go for a massage, reduce the stomach,

0:10:46.200,0:10:51.640
he is too short - he should be higher, and is too fat - he should be slimmer,

0:10:51.640,0:11:02.580
his head is too big - he should reduce it, there is too much fat in his hands - they should operate it -

0:11:02.580,0:11:08.100
that cannot give that love that will stand the test of time.

0:11:08.100,0:11:10.060
Let's look for love.

0:11:10.060,0:11:13.400
Tell your neighbour, "Let's look for love somewhere".

0:11:13.400,0:11:16.440
Let's look for love somewhere.

0:11:16.440,0:11:18.780
Not appearance.

0:11:18.780,0:11:21.800
So, I think this is where we are going now.

0:11:21.800,0:11:24.000
Deliverance will solve the problem.

0:11:24.000,0:11:28.060
The problem we used to have is not the issue of my stature or whatever...

0:11:28.060,0:11:30.800
No no no, don't defend yourself.

0:11:30.800,0:11:32.760
I'm not defending you.

0:11:32.760,0:11:35.560
I am not trying to defend you.

0:11:35.560,0:11:38.280
Don't build on my defence.

0:11:38.280,0:11:40.040
You can have a separate defence.

0:11:40.040,0:11:41.820
Don't talk about the appearance.

0:11:41.820,0:11:45.300
I'm only telling you the Word of God.

0:11:45.300,0:11:56.240
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:03.360,0:12:09.300
The original love, relationship comes from God.

0:12:09.300,0:12:18.380
If that relationship is the one that flows through your marriage, it has to do with things of the heart.

0:12:18.380,0:12:21.980
Things of the heart are quite different.

0:12:21.980,0:12:33.520
Listen, if you because of the things on the outside; appearance, money, position, being handsome,

0:12:33.520,0:12:40.680
get married with someone - bet with me; that marriage cannot stand the test of time.

What has happened to you is what has happened to the sister here.

0:12:49.380,0:12:51.680
I only mentioned your situation.

0:12:51.680,0:12:56.780
Yours is a disappointment.

0:12:56.780,0:13:04.980
The person she intended to marry before disappointed her.

0:13:09.660,0:13:16.260
Then she said, "Well, I just need to get married" - that is how she found you.

0:13:16.260,0:13:21.700
You have a problem and she has a problem - you need deliverance and she needs deliverance.

0:13:21.700,0:13:27.880
Let's assume you were able to find the person you are looking for to marry him from your heart -

0:13:27.880,0:13:30.700
this marriage would not exist today.

0:13:30.700,0:13:37.680
Let's assume she would be able to be with a person she gave her heart so much to

0:13:37.680,0:13:39.660
we would not talk of this marriage.

0:13:39.660,0:13:43.280
These two persons have similar problems.

0:13:43.280,0:13:45.700
Deliverance and deliverance.

0:13:45.700,0:13:47.120

I will see you people.
Thank you.
