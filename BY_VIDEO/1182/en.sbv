0:00:00.000,0:00:04.640
As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance to the people in Jesus' name,

0:00:04.640,0:00:08.900
he encounters this woman and the evil within her is exposed.

0:00:08.900,0:00:12.840
She will never be a psychiatrist.

0:00:12.840,0:00:18.460
If this girl can be a psychiatrist, the kingdom of darkness will lose.

0:00:18.460,0:00:20.100
She prays for patients.

0:00:20.100,0:00:22.220
Who gave her this sickness in her hand?

0:00:22.220,0:00:24.940
I gave her poison.

0:00:24.940,0:00:27.760
Everybody at work hates her.

0:00:27.760,0:00:29.480
She will never...

0:00:29.480,0:00:32.620
Listen you demon; how did you enter her?

0:00:32.620,0:00:35.100
I gave her poisoned coffee.

0:00:35.100,0:00:45.720
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:45.720,0:00:49.540
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:00:49.540,0:00:53.720
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:00:53.720,0:00:57.320
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:57.320,0:00:58.420
Amen!

0:00:58.420,0:01:01.140
My name is Sewela Setjie.

0:01:01.140,0:01:05.460
I am a medical doctor, specializing in psychiatry.

0:01:05.460,0:01:08.780
I'm 33 years old and I come from South Africa.

0:01:08.780,0:01:18.440
When I came to The SCOAN Easter Service 2017, I had three problems.

0:01:18.440,0:01:22.000
I had a problem with my right arm, my wrist.

0:01:22.000,0:01:31.060
I also had evil attacks as you saw in the clip, and I was also suffering from depression.

0:01:31.060,0:01:40.740
So I came and I was instantly healed from the problem that I had with my arm.

0:01:40.740,0:01:44.900
Every time I went to the doctors, they couldn't tell me what the problem was

0:01:44.900,0:01:49.560
but I was struggling at work - struggling to write, to function.

0:01:49.560,0:02:00.260
When I went home, I later on vomited the poison that you heart the evil spirit

0:02:00.260,0:02:02.760
speaking about in the clip.

0:02:02.760,0:02:08.280
These are the photos of the poison that I vomited.

0:02:08.280,0:02:11.420
So you can see right there is the poison.

0:02:11.420,0:02:15.320
The demon confessed that she had been poisoned through coffee

0:02:15.320,0:02:20.860
and this was the poison she actually vomited after that day.

0:02:20.860,0:02:22.740
You can see it there on her phone.

0:02:22.740,0:02:25.880
As you introduced yourself, you said you're a medical doctor

0:02:25.880,0:02:28.380
and you specialize in psychiatry.

0:02:28.380,0:02:32.600
Yet one of the problems you too were having when you came was depression.

0:02:32.600,0:02:38.880
Can you tell us about what God has done concerning that problem you once had.

0:02:38.880,0:02:45.220
I got divorced at the age of 26 and I also had a miscarriage.

0:02:45.220,0:02:50.780
Since then, I had been harboring deep pain in my heart.

0:02:50.780,0:02:54.200
Offence - I was offended at my ex-husband

0:02:54.200,0:02:59.360
I was also offended at God because I felt as if God was not with me

0:02:59.360,0:03:01.280
when I went through the challenges.

0:03:01.280,0:03:06.620
I went into depression; I was struggling at work.

0:03:06.620,0:03:11.580
The depression got so severe that at times when  was seeing patients,

0:03:11.580,0:03:15.740
if I asked a patient what their name was, how old they were,

0:03:15.740,0:03:19.000
I would forget the next question I was supposed to ask.

0:03:19.000,0:03:24.820
Sometimes, if I was driving, I would forget the direction.

0:03:24.820,0:03:28.380
I would have to stop on the way, on the side of the road.

0:03:28.380,0:03:31.620
It happened and I almost had an accident.

0:03:31.620,0:03:37.400
I had to call the psychiatrist who was treating me, crying for help.

0:03:37.400,0:03:44.340
At times if I went to the mall, parked my car, I would forget where the car was when I got out.

0:03:44.340,0:03:51.960
I needed to go out, take my remote, switch the car on wherever it was, for me to locate it.

0:03:51.960,0:03:56.800
I also later on had suicidal thoughts.

0:03:56.800,0:04:01.475
Honestly, being a medical doctor in psychiatry,

0:04:01.480,0:04:03.900
seeing what patients are going through

0:04:03.900,0:04:08.340
and going through the same thing made it hell.

0:04:08.340,0:04:12.173
I couldn't pray, focus or enjoy life.

0:04:12.180,0:04:14.600
I had no peace of heart.

0:04:14.600,0:04:18.200
I couldn't sleep; I lost so much weight.

0:04:18.200,0:04:21.440
Then I just decided that it was better for me to die.

0:04:21.440,0:04:25.440
When I was driving to the clinic because I work in Cape Town,

0:04:25.440,0:04:29.880
as I drove through passing the ocean, thoughts would come to me,

0:04:29.880,0:04:36.000
"Just drive  your car into the ocean" - almost every Thursday when I went to the clinic.

0:04:36.000,0:04:40.720
So we can see that the depression had really gone to an extreme level.

0:04:40.720,0:04:44.600
But you came to The SCOAN and received deliverance.

0:04:44.600,0:04:47.580
What happened thereafter?

0:04:47.580,0:04:55.580
When I came to The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua was teaching about forgiveness and unforgiveness.

0:04:55.580,0:05:01.680
And he said that a lot of Christians have never experienced the presence of God

0:05:01.680,0:05:08.200
because of harboring unforgiveness in their hearts, years of holding offence.

0:05:08.200,0:05:12.920
Later on when I went home, I watched the message again.

0:05:12.920,0:05:15.460
I meditated on the Word.

0:05:15.460,0:05:19.420
To be honest with you, children of God, when the prophet was preaching,

0:05:19.420,0:05:22.160
I didn't really think that message was for me;

0:05:22.160,0:05:27.120
I didn't really think that that was the cause of the depression.

0:05:27.120,0:05:30.200
I had suffered from depression since 2012,

0:05:30.200,0:05:33.280
taking medication but nothing was helping.

0:05:33.280,0:05:40.000
The more I meditated on the Word of God, that burden in my spirit was released.

0:05:40.000,0:05:45.260
And the healing that I was looking for for those many years came instantly.

0:05:45.260,0:05:48.260
Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:48.260,0:05:51.700

Deliverance / Healing Testimony

0:05:51.700,0:05:55.500
What has been happening is that now when I was at work,

0:05:55.500,0:06:00.260
I started doing my own research in a way on the side.

0:06:00.260,0:06:05.740
Most of the patients that came into my room were suffering from depression.

0:06:05.740,0:06:10.960
I would later ask them, "Madam, is there anybody that has hurt you in your life?"

0:06:10.960,0:06:13.860
I'm talking about people at the age of 60,

0:06:13.860,0:06:16.060
I'm talking about pastors' wives,

0:06:16.060,0:06:18.300
I'm talking about old men,

0:06:18.300,0:06:23.400
coming and crying and confessing that "Yes, in fact I was hurt".

0:06:23.400,0:06:27.360
I used the same sermon that I received,

0:06:27.360,0:06:35.400
the same word that I received from Prophet T.B. Joshua to minister into their lives.

0:06:35.400,0:06:37.500
Glory be to God.

0:06:37.500,0:06:41.060
And we know at that time, you had explained that apart from treating patients,

0:06:41.060,0:06:44.020
you had also began to treat yourself, taking medication.

0:06:44.020,0:06:47.760
What did you do with the medication?

0:06:47.760,0:06:53.920
The prophet said, "If you don't believe in God with your medication,

0:06:53.920,0:06:57.500
you will not believe in Him without your medication".

0:06:57.500,0:07:02.880
How or when I stopped taking the antidepressants - I will not tell you.

0:07:02.880,0:07:05.160
It came automatically.

0:07:05.160,0:07:08.460
I just started sleeping without it and I was able to sleep.

0:07:08.460,0:07:12.040
In fact, I was sleeping so much that I said, 
"God, this is too much.

0:07:12.040,0:07:16.480
I think You have healed me way too much".

0:07:16.480,0:07:19.640
I started enjoying life.

0:07:19.640,0:07:24.400
It is very painful for people to look at you and think, "Oh, you are successful";

0:07:24.400,0:07:27.760
to look at you from the outside and see you are dressed well,

0:07:27.760,0:07:30.060
but they don't know that what is going on in your heart

0:07:30.060,0:07:32.900
is even worse than cancer that people can see.

0:07:32.900,0:07:54.340
I give You glory Lord 
As I honour You

0:07:54.340,0:08:00.960
You are wonderful

0:08:00.960,0:08:06.520
You are worthy oh Lord

0:08:06.520,0:08:11.080
Amen! She has said it all. Congratulations!

0:08:11.080,0:08:16.180
And as your word of advice, let us know that we should refuse to be offended.

0:08:16.180,0:08:20.520
We have no right to hold offence whether offended or offender

0:08:20.520,0:08:24.680
as we all stand in helpless need of divine forgiveness.

0:08:24.680,0:08:27.171
Thank you so much for sharing your testimony.

0:08:27.171,0:08:30.400
You are blessed; continue to share it with others, in Jesus' name.
