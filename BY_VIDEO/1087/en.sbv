0:00:00.000,0:00:02.100
Man of God, please, help me.

0:00:02.100,0:00:08.680
My bone got broken since six months ago, due to an accident.

0:00:08.680,0:00:11.480
I am using crutches to walk.

0:00:11.480,0:00:13.460
Please, help me, man of God.

0:00:13.460,0:00:16.020
How do you know that Jesus would heal you?

0:00:16.020,0:00:19.920
I know that God would help me because He is still keeping me alive until now.

0:00:19.920,0:00:22.920
What would happen if you are not healed?

0:00:22.920,0:00:26.040
I believe that He will heal me.

0:00:26.040,0:00:29.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:29.140,0:00:33.220
If you are not healed, what would happen?

0:00:33.220,0:00:38.240
He would heal me. He is my God. He is supposed to heal me.

0:00:38.240,0:00:39.540
He would heal me.

0:00:39.540,0:00:41.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:41.460,0:00:44.040
I have been waiting for this time. He would heal me.

0:00:44.040,0:00:50.740
But answer this simple question: If you are not healed, what would be the state of your mind?

0:00:50.740,0:00:52.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:52.980,0:00:55.480
Man of God, I would be healed. I know I would be healed.

0:00:55.480,0:01:00.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:00.580,0:01:03.380
This is the last bus stop that I have.

0:01:03.380,0:01:05.160
I have gone to many places.

0:01:05.160,0:01:08.720
I have been talking to people in Liberia that I would come here and they would see me get healed.

0:01:08.720,0:01:10.660
You say this is the last bus stop?

0:01:10.660,0:01:11.740
This is a last bus stop.

0:01:11.740,0:01:15.280
So if this bus stop is not for you we would create another bust stop.

0:01:15.280,0:01:18.480
It is the last bus stop.

0:01:18.480,0:01:21.360
I can't go to a different place. This is the last bus stop.

0:01:21.360,0:01:24.000
I am supposed to be healed by the grace of God.

0:01:24.000,0:01:35.760
I am asking this question because it is easy to lose your miracle when you have not been grounded in the Word.

0:01:35.760,0:01:40.080
You can only maintain that miracle when you are grounded.

0:01:40.080,0:01:43.700
When you are grounded, submit to the Word after healing.

0:01:43.700,0:01:48.220
If you have been grounded and you receive the miracle,

0:01:48.220,0:01:51.320
automatically, you will be able to maintain it.

0:01:51.320,0:01:55.520
If you have not been grounded in the Word, you can receive the miracle as well

0:01:55.520,0:02:02.860
but you have to automatically submit to the Word so that you will be able to maintain it.

0:02:02.860,0:02:07.880
My father here has not been grounded in the Word.

0:02:07.880,0:02:16.240
So, if God heals him, he has to automatically submit to the  Word of God for maintenance.

0:02:16.240,0:02:17.720
Are you listening to me, sir?

0:02:17.720,0:02:18.440
Yes, sir.

0:02:18.440,0:02:21.640
The fact that you watch Emmanuel TV every day and you sleep with Emmanuel TV,

0:02:21.640,0:02:29.280
do you actually do what Emmanuel TV is saying, what you listen to?

0:02:29.280,0:02:31.520
Are you doing what the Word says?

0:02:31.520,0:02:33.320
That is the question.

0:02:33.320,0:02:39.500
What he is talking now is by feeling, emotion.

0:02:39.500,0:02:45.920
He is saying what he has been seeing happening to others.

0:02:45.920,0:02:56.360
It is not that he has received a conviction, message or revelation to come here.

0:02:56.360,0:03:02.180
For him, it's about, "I have seen people get healed, so, I am going there".

0:03:02.180,0:03:04.600
Let's hear from our mother.

0:03:04.600,0:03:06.500
How are you mum?

0:03:06.500,0:03:08.740
We are seeing you sitting here.

0:03:08.740,0:03:13.820
What revelation have you received that actually let to your coming here?

0:03:13.820,0:03:18.920
Man of God, I need help, healing.

0:03:18.920,0:03:20.960
I know you need healing.

0:03:20.960,0:03:23.000
It is revelation that brings healing.

0:03:23.000,0:03:24.240
Yes, man of God.

0:03:24.240,0:03:26.460
Meditation brings revelation.

0:03:26.460,0:03:30.980
The product of revelation is healing, deliverance and all that.

0:03:30.980,0:03:32.800
What revelation have you received?

0:03:32.800,0:03:38.160
Have you received any revelation from God concerning your health, your coming here?

0:03:38.160,0:03:42.900
If not, after your healing, you have to submit.

0:03:42.900,0:03:44.300
Yes, man of God.

0:03:44.300,0:03:51.180
Submit to the authority of the Word of God - that is the only way you can maintain your miracle.

0:03:51.180,0:03:53.800
People complain that their miracle is lost.

0:03:53.800,0:04:00.280
Why won't your miracle be lost when the Word is not  the standard for your life?

0:04:00.280,0:04:02.720
The Word must be the standard for your life.

0:04:02.720,0:04:06.780
If the Word has not been the standard for your life, you can also receive healing

0:04:06.780,0:04:12.160
but immediately you receive from Him, let the Word be the standard for your life to maintain it.

0:04:12.160,0:04:14.440
That is the only way you can maintain it.

0:04:14.440,0:04:18.320
The one who gave you should be the one to maintain you.

0:04:18.320,0:04:22.380
If Jesus gives, Jesus should be the One to maintain.

0:04:22.380,0:04:23.960
How are you?

0:04:23.960,0:04:25.260
Fine, man of God.

0:04:25.260,0:04:28.320
We are seeing you here today; you are welcome.

0:04:28.320,0:04:29.320
Thank you, man of God.

0:04:29.320,0:04:32.180
What message do you have concerning your coming here?

0:04:32.180,0:04:38.020
The message I have is that God is here, from what I have been seeing on Emmanuel TV.

0:04:38.020,0:04:39.640
How do you know that God is here?

0:04:39.640,0:04:41.760
How do you know God is inviting you?

0:04:41.760,0:04:43.420
Have you received God's invitation ?

0:04:43.420,0:04:48.040
My spirit tells me that God invited me here, and He made it possible for me to be here.

0:04:48.040,0:04:50.340
You spirit tells you?

0:04:50.340,0:04:51.740
Yes, man of God.

0:04:51.740,0:04:55.320
Where is the invitation?

0:04:55.320,0:04:57.620
Where is the invitation given to you to come?

0:04:57.620,0:04:59.400
It is spiritual.

0:04:59.400,0:05:02.040
It is my conviction.

0:05:02.040,0:05:04.260
Thank you, you are welcome.

0:05:04.260,0:05:13.060
Well, in some occasions too, if you are not invited and you go there, you may be received.

0:05:13.060,0:05:19.800
You would be received. It is not only invited people that enter the hall or are being attended to.

0:05:19.800,0:05:25.060
You may not be having an invitation but you go to the occasion and be received.

0:05:25.060,0:05:30.440
So, if you do not have God's invitation to come here and you come,

0:05:30.440,0:05:35.240
after He has attended to you, you have to submit to God.

0:05:35.240,0:05:38.160
If  not, it is all a waste.

0:05:38.160,0:05:41.200
There is no way you can maintain what you have received from God without God.

0:05:41.200,0:05:42.480
Tell your neighbour.

0:05:42.480,0:05:46.140
There is no way you can maintain what you have received from God without God.

0:05:46.140,0:05:54.960
In the world, you can receive something from A and run to B to maintain it.

0:05:54.960,0:05:59.820
In the case of Jesus, once you receive something from Him,

0:05:59.820,0:06:02.720
He should be the One to maintain it for you.

0:06:02.720,0:06:06.060
If not, you will loose it.

0:06:06.060,0:06:09.820
This is why we run helter-skelter today.

0:06:09.820,0:06:14.360
You were there yesterday but where are you today?

0:06:14.360,0:06:16.000
You think you can rob Him.

0:06:16.000,0:06:22.200
It's all for the salvation of your soul.

0:06:22.200,0:06:25.820
Be ready to stay with Him for maintenance.

0:06:25.820,0:06:29.440
You lack maintenance;
stay with Him for maintenance.

0:06:29.440,0:06:30.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:06:30.140,0:06:32.020
Stay with Him for maintenance.

0:06:32.020,0:06:32.680
Again.

0:06:32.680,0:06:34.680
Stay with Him for maintenance.

0:06:34.680,0:06:42.900
Because the blessing of Jesus attracts attack.

0:06:42.900,0:06:50.020
The healing of Jesus attracts attack.

0:06:50.020,0:06:55.260
The breakthrough from Jesus attracts attack.

0:06:55.260,0:07:02.000
When you receive the healing now, attack would be looking for you.

0:07:02.000,0:07:04.320
The healing is like honey.

0:07:04.320,0:07:09.560
Once you are given that honey, insects seek it and find it.

0:07:09.560,0:07:15.000
You will see insects looking for it without invitation.

0:07:15.000,0:07:18.920
So, He must be the One to maintain that honey for you.

0:07:18.920,0:07:22.260
You cannot maintain it; only Him can maintain it.

0:07:22.260,0:07:26.640
Let God's Word be the standard for your life.

0:07:26.640,0:07:27.140
Thank you.
