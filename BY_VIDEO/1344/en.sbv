Praise the living Jesus.

If you're happy to be in the presence of God, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus.

0:00:08.840,0:00:16.360
If you believe today is your day, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus.

0:00:16.360,0:00:21.200
Yes, greet your neighbours; say, "You are welcome to the presence of God".

0:00:21.200,0:00:25.180
You are welcome to the presence of God.

0:00:25.180,0:00:30.340
Viewers all over the world, we welcome you, in Jesus' name.

You may be seated.

0:00:36.960,0:00:41.740
Praise the Lord.

0:00:41.740,0:00:49.480
The Bible says that the essence of true worship is in honouring God

0:00:49.480,0:00:54.940
with what our lives depend on.

0:00:54.940,0:01:01.520
Once again, I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

0:01:01.520,0:01:06.540
How many of us love the Lord with all our heart?

0:01:06.540,0:01:11.640
How many of us love the Lord with all our strength?

0:01:11.640,0:01:16.080
With all our quality time - how many of us?

0:01:16.080,0:01:23.820
All our localty and substance - how many of us?

0:01:23.820,0:01:29.060
Well, it is good to see the raised hands.

0:01:29.060,0:01:37.380
But you know the answer to this question is more of the heart and a call for self-examination.

0:01:37.380,0:01:45.480
Ask yourself, "Do I really love God?"

0:01:45.480,0:01:49.940
Now ask your neighbour, "Do you really love God?"

0:01:49.940,0:01:58.500
You can see that the answer to the question is more of the heart and a call for self-examination.

0:01:58.500,0:02:09.280
God is concerned about you.

0:02:09.280,0:02:21.200
The Bible says He is busy planting the seeds of what you are becoming, if you love in truth.

0:02:21.200,0:02:32.100
In John 17:18, Jesus said to all His disciples, believers, Christians:

0:02:32.100,0:02:43.500
As the Father has sent me, so send I you - to love one another, just as I love you.

0:02:43.500,0:02:55.060
This statement was a kind of commissioning in all believers, thus giving them a pattern of operation.

0:02:55.060,0:02:59.860
In other words, Jesus was simply saying:

0:02:59.860,0:03:07.400
As my Father has commissioned me to be a solution to everyone in trouble,

0:03:07.400,0:03:18.280
so have I commissioned you as a solution.

0:03:18.280,0:03:24.360
Every person you meet today is trying to change their life in some way

0:03:24.360,0:03:28.520
but they don't just know how to.

0:03:28.520,0:03:37.700
Some want their health to be improved; others want financial freedom.

0:03:37.700,0:03:44.780
No matter your status in life - are you rich or poor?

0:03:44.780,0:03:51.720
No matter your status in life - are you strong or weak?

0:03:51.720,0:03:55.240
Are you educated or uneducated?

0:03:55.240,0:04:07.640
Someone is waiting for a lifeline from you, for you to put a quality smile on their face.

0:04:07.640,0:04:14.660
Therefore, do not allow your social, political, economic, cultural or religious background

0:04:14.660,0:04:23.160
to rob you of your love for Christ - I mean your love for one another.

0:04:23.160,0:04:29.860
Today, we claim we love God, yet our heart is full of offence,

0:04:29.860,0:04:34.540
making it difficult to love one another.

0:04:34.540,0:04:43.620
That is why Jesus says in Matthew 25, I was hungry - you gave me no food.

0:04:43.620,0:04:48.080
I was thirsty - you gave me no water.

0:04:48.080,0:04:52.680
I was a stranger - you did not take me in.

0:04:52.680,0:04:56.660
I was naked - you did not clothe me.

0:04:56.660,0:05:02.680
I was sick in prison - you did not visit me.

0:05:02.680,0:05:08.980
On that occasion His disciples asked, Master, when were you naked?

0:05:08.980,0:05:12.760
When were you thirsty and when were you hungry?

0:05:12.760,0:05:30.960
Jesus replied: When you stood in the midst of the lowly, those who could not help themselves.

0:05:30.960,0:05:38.940
Maybe you only imagine you are in the company of the poor, the uneducated, the destitute,

0:05:38.940,0:05:43.340
the weak and disadvantaged people.

0:05:43.340,0:05:51.700
Don't be surprised when you eventually realise, perhaps too late,

0:05:51.700,0:05:59.940
that it was Jesus Himself whom you denied.

0:05:59.940,0:06:03.740
That is why I tell you that do not allow your social, political, economic,

0:06:03.740,0:06:08.920
religious and cultural background to rob you of your love for Christ.

0:06:08.920,0:06:12.080
I mean your love for one another.

0:06:12.080,0:06:17.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:17.300,0:06:26.500
Today we all desire to reap but the question is: What have we planted?

0:06:26.500,0:06:31.040
If you plant love, the Bible says, you will reap love

0:06:31.040,0:06:37.880
because there is no loving in truth that does not express itself in giving.

0:06:37.880,0:06:42.040
There is no giving in truth without receiving.

0:06:42.040,0:06:48.480
The Bible says that true blessing actually comes from giving.

0:06:48.480,0:06:57.540
If you truly possess love - which is one of the fruits of the Spirit - the nature of God -

0:06:57.540,0:07:02.900
you will not look to the other side when your fellow brothers are in need.

0:07:02.900,0:07:06.620
This is compromise.

0:07:06.620,0:07:15.020
Many today believe that they can only give out of abundance, when they have surplus,

0:07:15.020,0:07:18.680
when they have plenty, when they are healed,

0:07:18.680,0:07:21.460
when they are blessed, when they have a breakthrough.

0:07:21.460,0:07:25.960
But this is a false belief.

0:07:25.960,0:07:30.180
Ask the poor widow in the book of 1 Kings 17

0:07:30.180,0:07:39.420
and she will tell you that everyone has something to give, no matter how small or big.

0:07:39.420,0:07:43.060
That is why Prophet T.B. Joshua says and I quote:

0:07:43.060,0:07:52.380
Your idea of 'if only I add money' keeps robbing you of your blessings.

0:07:52.380,0:08:01.100
Your idea of 'if I were strong' keeps robbing you of your strength.

0:08:01.100,0:08:10.600
Your idea of 'if I were free' keeps robbing you of your freedom.

0:08:10.600,0:08:16.720
Your idea of 'if I had money, I would give to the poor, I would help the weak,

0:08:16.720,0:08:22.740
if I were strong, I would help the less privileged, I would help the weak'...

0:08:22.740,0:08:34.080
The danger here is that if you fail to help from the little God has blessed you with, more may never come.

0:08:34.080,0:08:44.540
If you fail to help from the little strength God has given you, more may never come.

0:08:44.540,0:08:54.560
Brethren, help and be helped, when you help for God's sake.

0:08:54.560,0:09:02.460
Tell your neighbour, "Help and be helped, when you help for God's sake".

0:09:02.460,0:09:10.240
Love and receive love, when you love for God's sake.

0:09:10.240,0:09:15.320
This will bring me to the title of my message: "The Secret of Abundance".

0:09:15.320,0:09:21.880
Tell your neighbour, "The Secret of Abundance".

0:09:21.880,0:09:27.960
God is concerned about our growth.

0:09:27.960,0:09:38.760
Quickly turn with me to the Book of Galatians and that will be our first proof text for this message.

0:09:38.760,0:09:47.700
The Book of Galatians 6.

0:09:47.700,0:09:52.680
Let's take our reading from verse 6.

0:09:52.680,0:09:55.780
Are you there?

0:09:55.780,0:10:04.860
"Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.

0:10:04.860,0:10:15.820
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.

0:10:15.820,0:10:22.240
For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption,

0:10:22.240,0:10:30.480
but he sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life."

0:10:30.480,0:10:32.600
Verse 9.

0:10:32.600,0:10:36.980
"And let us not grow weary while doing good,

0:10:36.980,0:10:44.460
for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.

0:10:44.460,0:10:50.800
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all,

0:10:50.800,0:10:57.580
especially to those who are of the household of faith."

0:10:57.580,0:11:02.240
Let us read that verse 10 together.

0:11:02.240,0:11:09.140
"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all,

0:11:09.140,0:11:15.360
especially to those who are of the household of faith."

0:11:15.360,0:11:19.440
Praise the Lord.

0:11:19.440,0:11:31.680
The Bible says we must do good to all, especially to those of the household of faith.

0:11:31.680,0:11:37.880
Those who are to receive must learn how to plant.

0:11:37.880,0:11:45.880
Anyone who plants, the Bible says, is conscious of the future

0:11:45.880,0:11:53.960
because he will find help if he ever falls on hard times.

0:11:53.960,0:12:00.780
Anyone who plants is conscious of the future

0:12:00.780,0:12:07.840
because he will find help if he ever falls on hard times.

0:12:07.840,0:12:19.080
Brethren, today is for planting and tomorrow is for reaping.

0:12:19.080,0:12:26.480
Patience is an important tool when you are planting;

0:12:26.480,0:12:33.200
you must wait for what you plant to mature.

0:12:33.200,0:12:39.640
Surely your seed will come back to you in a hundredfold.

0:12:39.640,0:12:51.460
Just as the Bible says in Psalm 37:25 that the fruit of the righteous extends to his children.

0:12:51.460,0:12:57.480
If you realise that what you do today, whether good or bad, extends to your children,

0:12:57.480,0:13:04.160
then you will be careful of what you are doing now.

0:13:04.160,0:13:12.500
If you are conscious that whatever you do today, whether good or bad, extends to your fruit,

0:13:12.500,0:13:21.460
you will be conscious of whatever you are doing now.

0:13:21.460,0:13:27.860
Whatever situation you may be facing, if you are to know a successful life,

0:13:27.860,0:13:44.200
you must learn to plant your strength, forgiveness, mercy, kindness, faithfulness and love.

0:13:44.200,0:13:48.280
You must plant them.

0:13:48.280,0:13:58.340
God is not so much concerned about what we have to give as the manner in which we give it.

0:13:58.340,0:14:07.820
If you are to know a successful life, then you must learn to plant your strength, forgiveness,

0:14:07.820,0:14:16.560
kindness, faithfulness, mercy, favour and love.

0:14:16.560,0:14:22.260
Ask the widow in the Book of Mark 12 and she will tell you

0:14:22.260,0:14:28.780
that giving is a real privilege when it is done in a proper attitude.

0:14:28.780,0:14:35.440
The Book of Mark 12 captures the irony of a situation where a poor widow is exalted

0:14:35.440,0:14:46.700
far above the high and mighty in the society - all because of her selfless generosity

0:14:46.700,0:14:54.660
The Bible says she was one of those without any legal, political, social or economic stature

0:14:54.660,0:15:10.240
but Jesus noticed her as she gave her true offering.

0:15:10.240,0:15:16.500
Even though she was in dire need, the Bible says, she never held back.

0:15:16.500,0:15:22.400
Her action shows an example of sacrificial giving.

0:15:22.400,0:15:29.320
She was the only one who understood the principle of unlimited love and faith.

0:15:29.320,0:15:36.980
Let someone say, "Unlimited love and faith".

0:15:36.980,0:15:44.360
She was the only one who understood the principle of unlimited love and faith.

0:15:44.360,0:15:46.100
- a poor widow.

0:15:46.100,0:15:55.420
God is most honoured in our sacrificial giving.

0:15:55.420,0:16:01.000
True giving is sacrificial indeed.

0:16:01.000,0:16:05.880
The word 'sacrifice' does not suggest a bed of roses.

0:16:05.880,0:16:15.380
When you give, when you release forgiveness, sometimes it will cost you some pain to do so.

0:16:15.380,0:16:20.120
Sacrifice does not suggest a bed of roses.

0:16:20.120,0:16:25.740
When you sacrifice, you must feel the pain.

0:16:25.740,0:16:32.800
It is better not to give than to give what is not important to you.

0:16:32.800,0:16:38.380
The Bible says that God is most honoured by our sacrificial giving

0:16:38.380,0:16:45.060
but He is dishonoured by our offering of convenience.

0:16:45.060,0:16:48.380
We want to do it at our time.

0:16:48.380,0:16:52.220
We want to do it when we wish to do it.

0:16:52.220,0:16:55.460
We want to do it in our own way.

0:16:55.460,0:17:00.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:00.740,0:17:12.720
Brethren, ask Joseph in the Book of Genesis 41 - when you have the time, read it.

0:17:12.720,0:17:17.220
Ask Joseph in that Book of Genesis 41 and he will tell you

0:17:17.220,0:17:38.580
that whatever is in your hand right now is capable of changing the course of your life.

0:17:38.580,0:17:45.560
When he found himself in the prison, the Bible says, he never waited for a more convenient time

0:17:45.560,0:17:58.520
to show himself as a commissioned solution provider, even in pain and suffering.

0:17:58.520,0:18:03.360
Whatever situation you may be facing, brethren - whether you are happy or not -

0:18:03.360,0:18:09.640
you must always remember that weeping must not hinder your sowing.

0:18:09.640,0:18:14.860
No matter what your situation looks like, no matter how you feel,

0:18:14.860,0:18:22.380
brethren, weeping must not hinder your sowing.

0:18:22.380,0:18:29.660
Remember the beauty of life does not depend on how happy or youful you are

0:18:29.660,0:18:34.920
but how happy others can be because of you.

0:18:34.920,0:18:37.660
This was what Joseph realised;

0:18:37.660,0:18:48.180
he realised that sowing seeds in faith is using what God has given to obtain what God has promised.

0:18:48.180,0:18:55.240
That is why he released forgiveness, even when he found himself in prison.

0:18:55.240,0:19:03.660
Joseph released forgiveness. The Bible says, his gift, his talent ushered him to the throne;

0:19:03.660,0:19:12.520
his gift, his talent ushered him to his divine destiny.

0:19:12.520,0:19:18.860
It therefore implies that there is no one that God has created without a gift.

0:19:18.860,0:19:28.240
There is no one that God has created without a talent.

0:19:28.240,0:19:34.940
Brethren, your care to the lonely,

0:19:34.940,0:19:42.280
viewers all over the world, your concern for the weak,

0:19:42.280,0:19:53.120
the forgiveness you show to others might be what they need for their recovery

0:19:53.120,0:20:03.240
and at the same time that might be what you need to plant to discover your own destiny.

0:20:03.240,0:20:08.840
The love you give to the needy, the compassion you show,

0:20:08.840,0:20:14.600
the concern you give, the forgiveness you release to others -

0:20:14.600,0:20:22.480
that might be what you need to discover your divine destiny

0:20:22.480,0:20:29.440
and that might be what they need to discover themselves.

0:20:29.440,0:20:33.440
That may be what they need for their own recovery.

0:20:33.440,0:20:42.320
It might be what you need to plant to discover your own destiny.

0:20:42.320,0:20:48.500
If you say you are weak, don't be surprised to see those who are weaker than you.

0:20:48.500,0:20:54.040
If you say you are poor, don't be surprised to see those who are poorer than you.

0:20:54.040,0:21:01.940
Whatever that is in your hand right now is what God will use to bless others through you.

0:21:01.940,0:21:10.640
Someone is somewhere in need of what you have in your hand for their survival.

0:21:10.640,0:21:14.640
The Bible says it is true we may not be equally gifted

0:21:14.640,0:21:25.440
but God has done it in such a way that we all have some strength to contribute to one another.

0:21:25.440,0:21:37.980
You begin to succeed with your life when the hurts and problems of others begin to matter to you.

0:21:37.980,0:21:47.520
Tell your neighbour, "You begin to succeed with your life

0:21:47.520,0:21:55.540
when the hurts and problems of others begin to matter to you".

0:21:55.540,0:22:05.440
Remember the title of our message: The Secret of Abundance.

0:22:05.440,0:22:12.480
The Bible says that God oftentimes uses men as instruments of justice,

0:22:12.480,0:22:23.280
peace, kindness, love, patience, favour.

0:22:23.280,0:22:34.580
Brethren, God is concerned about your growth.

0:22:34.580,0:22:42.520
Viewers all over the world, God is concerned about your growth.

0:22:42.520,0:22:51.780
Today, many are not growing because they fail to realise that their future is connected to people.

0:22:51.780,0:23:01.480
Many deny their future from being reshaped because they never find joy or reason in helping others.

0:23:01.480,0:23:05.620
Many deny their future from being reshaped

0:23:05.620,0:23:19.400
because they never find joy or reason in releasing forgiveness, in settling differences.

0:23:19.400,0:23:25.400
You may say you are in the business of giving but there is nothing to show for it.

0:23:25.400,0:23:31.260
You may say, "I've been helping the poor but there is nothing to show for it".

0:23:31.260,0:23:38.580
You may say, "I released forgiveness but still, there is nothing to show for it!"

0:23:38.580,0:23:45.360
You may say, "I give everything I have to the poor but there is nothing to show for it".

0:23:45.360,0:23:50.480
Check the way and manner you give it.

0:23:50.480,0:24:00.080
If you have not seen anything, check the way and manner you give it.

0:24:00.080,0:24:09.380
When you give with pride and arrogance, you honour yourself and dishonour God,

0:24:09.380,0:24:14.520
thereby magnifying yourself above your Heavenly Father.

0:24:14.520,0:24:20.600
That is why it is difficult to see the results.

0:24:20.600,0:24:27.480
When you give with pride and arrogance, the Bible says we make ourselves creditors

0:24:27.480,0:24:31.600
instead of the debtors we are.

0:24:31.600,0:24:43.160
Remember, we are all debtors, being sinners; God is our Creditor, our Provider.

0:24:43.160,0:24:51.440
Tell your neighbour, "God is concerned about your growth".

0:24:51.440,0:24:56.860
God is concerned about our growth.

0:24:56.860,0:25:07.040
Finally brethren, let's turn our Bible to the Book of 2 Corinthians 9

0:25:07.040,0:25:12.740
and let us take our reading from verse 6.

0:25:12.740,0:25:21.000
"But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,

0:25:21.000,0:25:27.680
and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.

0:25:27.680,0:25:38.840
So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity;

0:25:38.840,0:25:42.600
for God loves a cheerful Giver."

0:25:42.600,0:25:52.360
The Bible says, as children of God, when you release the seed in your hand -

0:25:52.360,0:26:02.800
it may be the seed of forgiveness, love, compassion -

0:26:02.800,0:26:13.380
the Lord promises to take the blessing in His hand and release it to your life.

0:26:13.380,0:26:16.860
If you release the seed in your hand, brethren,

0:26:16.860,0:26:28.640
the Lord promises to take the blessing in His hand release it to your life.

0:26:28.640,0:26:34.920
This is a divine principle of a bountiful harvest that the Lord has founded

0:26:34.920,0:26:41.400
in all believers who are in their occupation of destiny.

0:26:41.400,0:26:49.920
This is a divine principle of a bountiful harvest that the Lord has founded

0:26:49.920,0:27:00.760
in all of us who are in our occupation of destiny.

0:27:00.760,0:27:07.140
Remember, giving is not only in monetary terms - it may be your mercy, favour,

0:27:07.140,0:27:14.580
forgiveness, care, concern, compassion.

0:27:14.580,0:27:19.580
There are many people on the sickbed in the hospital.

0:27:19.580,0:27:25.700
Visit them, show them care, love.

0:27:25.700,0:27:30.900
Who knows - that might be what they need for their recovery.

0:27:30.900,0:27:40.900
Who knows - that might be what is needed of you to discover your divine destiny.

0:27:40.900,0:27:54.540
Whatever that is in your hand right now is enough to create the future you desire.

0:27:54.540,0:27:58.560
Tell your neighbour, "Whatever that is in my hand right now..."

0:27:58.560,0:28:03.640
Raise your hand and say, "Whatever that is in my hand right now

0:28:03.640,0:28:12.220
is capable of changing the history of my life,

0:28:12.220,0:28:18.900
is capable of changing the course of my life.

0:28:18.900,0:28:25.560
Whether small or big - it doesn't matter.

0:28:25.560,0:28:32.600
By doing this, brethren, you will discover who you are.

0:28:32.600,0:28:38.380
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:28:38.380,0:28:47.440
Unforgiveness causes us to ignore our offenders when they are in pain.

0:28:47.440,0:28:51.260
Many a times we see those who hurt us - they are in trouble.

0:28:51.260,0:28:55.360
We ignore them, "It is not my business.

0:28:55.360,0:29:02.540
Okay, you can see he is reaping the fruits of his labour".

0:29:02.540,0:29:14.600
Unforgiveness causes us to ignore our offenders when they are in pain, trouble;

0:29:14.600,0:29:23.120
it retaliates and rejoices when others are hurt.

0:29:23.120,0:29:33.780
It is hard for those with unforgiveness in their heart to release help to their offenders.

0:29:33.780,0:29:41.000
The Bible says, it is more blessed, more rewarding to help those who hurt you,

0:29:41.000,0:29:43.780
those who do not share the same faith with you,

0:29:43.780,0:29:48.840
those who cannot even give you back.

0:29:48.840,0:29:51.940
You can count how many times you have seen those who hurt you,

0:29:51.940,0:29:57.180
you have seen your offenders in trouble and you ignored them.

0:29:57.180,0:30:03.540
Don't be surprised when you eventually realise, perhaps too late,

0:30:03.540,0:30:08.180
that it was Jesus Himself whom you denied

0:30:08.180,0:30:13.600
Ask yourself: Do I really love God?

0:30:13.600,0:30:21.160
Let that question run in your heart: Do I really love God?

0:30:21.160,0:30:30.620
How does the love of God function in a man who only thinks, works with an empty and idle word?

0:30:30.620,0:30:39.800
Ultimately, the Bible says we are called to respond to all human needs for that is what love entails.

0:30:39.800,0:30:48.700
This does not, however, mean that our care for the needy alone is enough to bring us to salvation.

0:30:48.700,0:30:56.220
But the Bible says, it forms the basis of judging the level of our kindness.

0:30:56.220,0:31:06.640
Looking the other side when your fellow brother is in trouble is equay to rejecting Christ.

0:31:06.640,0:31:13.620
Brethren, if you are waiting for a more convenient time to release forgiveness,

0:31:13.620,0:31:18.360
if you are waiting for a more convenient time to help the weak,

0:31:18.360,0:31:26.140
to help those who are in need, that time may never come.

0:31:26.140,0:31:34.580
If you are waiting for the time when you have abundance, that time may never come.

0:31:34.580,0:31:57.020
What we give out of little means a lot to us but the Bible says it attracts God's attention.

0:31:57.020,0:32:02.580
I want to leave you with these thoughts in mind.

0:32:02.580,0:32:10.820
Viewers all over the world, I want to leave you with this one thought in mind.

0:32:10.820,0:32:18.680
You will reap the full harvest of whatever you sow if only you persevere.

0:32:18.680,0:32:28.340
Tell your neighbour, "You will reap whatever you sow if only you persevere".

0:32:28.340,0:32:42.360
May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart, in Jesus' name.

0:32:42.360,0:32:44.220
Thank You, Jesus.
