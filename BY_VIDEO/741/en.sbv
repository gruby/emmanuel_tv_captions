0:00:00.640,0:00:12.240
We want the Lord to expose among us those spirits that kill, steal and destroy.

0:00:12.240,0:00:21.200
Holy Ghost fire!

0:00:21.200,0:00:23.200
Say, out!

0:00:23.200,0:00:27.680
When the fire of the Holy Ghost fell during the mass prayer of the first service,

0:00:27.680,0:00:32.000
arresting many who are possessed by evil spirits, was this man.

0:00:32.000,0:00:37.360
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:38.040,0:00:43.520
In the second service, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, furthered his deliverance

0:00:43.520,0:00:45.680
with a prophetic revelation.

0:00:45.680,0:00:48.820
Let us listen to the prophecy and its confirmation.

0:00:48.820,0:00:55.000
I see the involvement of a human being to make a charm

0:00:55.000,0:00:58.160
and that charm has become a demon.

0:00:58.160,0:01:00.200
It is in your house as I'm talking now.

0:01:00.200,0:01:01.480
Yes, sir.

0:01:01.480,0:01:03.900
My name is Tony.

0:01:03.900,0:01:09.400
When I had a problem I was initiated with a concotion.

0:01:09.400,0:01:12.880
The concotion comes to meet me every night in Lagos here.

0:01:12.880,0:01:17.820
It comes like a human being, calling my name and speaking with me

0:01:17.820,0:01:19.380
like a human being.

0:01:19.380,0:01:24.140
He will tell me what he wants, telling me that he needs such and such things.

0:01:24.140,0:01:29.680
I should bring them for him and I would do that.

0:01:29.680,0:01:34.640
The reason why he is running now is that he is afraid; they are getting very close to him.

0:01:34.640,0:01:37.540
He abandoned the house and he is now looking for somebody who can save him.

0:01:37.540,0:01:40.860
The demon is chasing him.

0:01:40.860,0:01:43.420
The concotion has become a human being.

0:01:43.420,0:01:44.700
It appears to you?

0:01:44.700,0:01:45.320
Yes, sir.

0:01:45.320,0:01:46.120
Physically?

0:01:46.120,0:01:47.280
Yes, sir.

0:01:47.280,0:01:57.220
One of the reasons God gives us His power is to confirm that

0:01:57.220,0:02:03.200
we are speaking for Him.

0:02:03.200,0:02:07.380
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:02:07.380,0:02:09.380
Out!

0:02:11.820,0:02:17.220
In the name of Jesus Christ, out!

0:02:26.600,0:02:31.700
Following the prophetic message given to Mr Anthony Nnemeka last Sunday,

0:02:31.700,0:02:36.400
the man of God gave him Anointing Water and instructed him in the name of Jesus

0:02:36.400,0:02:39.220
to go to the village and bring the charm.

0:02:45.080,0:02:49.020
This is the place where the charm the man of God prophecied about last Sunday is.

0:02:49.020,0:02:52.620
This is where it is in my village.

0:02:52.620,0:02:54.720
This is where I kept the charm.

0:02:54.720,0:02:57.680
This is the Anointing Water that the man of God gave to me to spray

0:02:57.680,0:03:00.800
on the charm and bring it to Lagos.

0:03:05.160,0:03:09.760
I command you to be destroyed in the name of Jesus.

0:03:17.200,0:03:20.120
This is the black cloth that used to cover it.

0:03:20.120,0:03:23.420
I command you to be destroyed in the name of Jesus.

0:03:23.420,0:03:27.520
In line with the word of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:03:27.520,0:03:35.800
I command you to be destroyed in the name of Jesus.

0:03:40.100,0:03:44.700
This is the 'juju' (charm), the pot and everything.

0:03:44.700,0:03:48.400
This is the pot used for the sacrifice.

0:03:48.400,0:03:51.440
I never came here for the sacrifice.

0:03:51.440,0:03:55.060
I used to send people because the charm is very powerful.

0:03:55.060,0:03:57.540
This is the Anointing Water.

0:03:57.540,0:04:04.200
I command you to be destroyed in the name of Jesus.

0:04:04.200,0:04:06.060
Look at the smoke!

0:04:06.060,0:04:07.960
Smoke is coming out!

0:04:07.960,0:04:09.240
Look at the smoke!

0:04:09.240,0:04:10.880
The power is going out.

0:04:10.880,0:04:13.260
The spirit is going out.

0:04:14.020,0:04:17.720
That smoke is a demon going away.

0:04:17.720,0:04:20.260
You see a pot but it is a demon.

0:04:20.260,0:04:21.280
Let's watch.

0:04:21.740,0:04:26.180
In the name of Jesus.

0:04:26.180,0:04:29.220
Jesus! You see the smoke going out. Jesus!

0:04:29.220,0:04:33.800
I'm afraid because the spirit is going out.

0:04:33.800,0:04:35.800
Eh! Chineke (God)!

0:04:40.220,0:04:42.320
Jesus!

0:04:42.320,0:04:45.560
My hand is being shocked!

0:04:45.560,0:04:47.020
Jesus!

0:04:47.020,0:04:50.160
In the name of Jesus, I command you to go out!

0:04:50.160,0:04:52.160
My hand is being shocked!

0:04:52.160,0:05:04.820
In the name of Jesus!

0:05:04.820,0:05:08.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua sent me to destroy you with the Anointing Water

0:05:08.440,0:05:10.440
and I hereby destroy you in the name of Jesus.

0:05:10.440,0:05:14.260
You must be destroyed in the name of Jesus.

0:05:14.260,0:05:17.420
I command every power in you to be destroyed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:17.420,0:05:28.540
In the name of Jesus!

0:05:28.540,0:05:34.440
You must go to Lagos, in the name of Jesus.

0:05:34.440,0:05:39.800
If not for God, I would not have been able to carry it.

0:05:39.800,0:05:41.800
It is very powerful.

0:05:41.800,0:05:46.380
But in the name of Jesus, every power in the thing is destroyed.

0:05:46.380,0:05:49.680
Thank You, Jesus.

0:05:51.420,0:05:56.940
Anthony Nnemeka arrives at The SCOAN with the charm.

0:05:56.940,0:06:00.340
He has come back for his final deliverance.

0:06:00.340,0:06:03.100
Thank God for the grace! Thank You, Jesus!

0:06:07.620,0:06:13.620
The purpose of watching this programme is for others to see and know that

0:06:13.620,0:06:17.060
there is refuge - Jesus is the refuge.

0:06:22.340,0:06:26.220
My name is Tony from Anambra State.

0:06:26.220,0:06:29.140
I was the one the man of God prophesied to last Sunday

0:06:29.140,0:06:32.800
that I have a charm in the village.

0:06:32.800,0:06:35.560
Yes, I'm the one.

0:06:35.560,0:06:41.640
It happened that when I had a problem, I went to a herbalist.

0:06:41.640,0:06:44.820
The herbalist said that he would prepare a charm for me.

0:06:44.820,0:06:50.200
After preparing the charm, he asked me to carry it to my house in the village

0:06:50.200,0:06:54.060
and keep it there and I did that.

0:06:54.060,0:06:58.140
I kept the charm in the village and came back to Lagos.

0:06:58.140,0:07:03.420
The charm always came and met me, the demon always came and met me in Lagos

0:07:03.420,0:07:11.260
and told me to come and sacrifice something like a dog or chicken and I would do that.

0:07:11.260,0:07:17.420
After doing that, I realised that the charm was destroying my family.

0:07:17.420,0:07:20.380
I decided to go for deliverance.

0:07:20.380,0:07:22.840
One day, I was watching Emmanuel TV.

0:07:22.840,0:07:27.700
I saw the way Prophet T.B. Joshua was delivering people

0:07:27.700,0:07:30.180
and I then decided to come to this place.

0:07:30.180,0:07:35.200
The night that I decided to come to this place, the demon came to meet me at midnight

0:07:35.200,0:07:39.780
and told me that as he was killing people, did I know that he can also kill me.

0:07:39.780,0:07:42.220
I asked him, "Why? What have I done?"

0:07:42.220,0:07:47.320
He did not answer me and left. That was before I came here last week Sunday.

0:07:47.320,0:07:51.380
Last week Sunday, the man of God prophesied to me.

0:07:51.380,0:07:54.520
This is me and the charm is also here.

0:07:54.520,0:07:58.200
The man of God gave me Anointing Water to go to my village,

0:07:58.200,0:08:03.500
spray it on the charm and bring it to Lagos State. I then went.

0:08:03.500,0:08:09.660
In the process of spraying the Anointing Water, smoke began to come out of the charm.

0:08:09.660,0:08:13.180
I was very scared because the charm is very powerful.

0:08:13.180,0:08:17.220
After spraying the Anointing Water, the smoke stopped.

0:08:17.220,0:08:23.760
As I wanted to put the charm into the bag, the charm began to shock my hand.

0:08:23.760,0:08:28.660
I began to pray and sprayed the Anointing Water on my hand, then it stopped.

0:08:28.660,0:08:33.760
Then I put the charm into the bag and brought it to Lagos.

0:08:33.760,0:08:36.040
Man of God, the charm is outside.

0:08:37.980,0:08:47.180
The worst of sin can be forgiven

0:08:47.180,0:08:54.880
Are your sins so grave or small

0:08:55.860,0:09:01.600
This is where we put the things sacrificed to the charm.

0:09:01.600,0:09:05.240
The charm was for my protection.

0:09:05.240,0:09:07.920
Through this charm, I was initiated.

0:09:08.480,0:09:10.320
Get the Anointing Water.

0:09:10.320,0:09:13.700
Just take the carton there. Let him take one out of it.

0:09:13.700,0:09:18.060
Okay. We need to sanctify the two hands.

0:09:18.060,0:09:21.240
Man of God said that the Anointing Water should be given to the man

0:09:21.240,0:09:24.600
for total separation from this demonic charm.

0:09:24.600,0:09:27.680
As you can see on the screen of your television set.

0:09:27.680,0:09:30.860
A newcomer there, please come.

0:09:30.860,0:09:34.440
Follow her to that place and give her Anointing Water.

0:09:34.440,0:09:36.880
Let her spray this Anointing Water on both hands.

0:09:36.880,0:09:39.240
Let us see what will happen to the man.

0:09:43.000,0:09:46.560
The Anointing Water we are going to collect today will be sprayed on both hands

0:09:46.560,0:09:49.300
which the man used to carry this demonic charm

0:09:49.300,0:09:52.260
so that we all can see the manifestation of the mighty power.

0:09:52.260,0:09:54.260
Just pick one out of it.

0:09:56.460,0:10:01.040
Watch the screen. The woman is picking the Anointing Water from the carton,

0:10:01.040,0:10:05.720
opening it, bringing it out and is about to unseal the Anointing Water bottle.

0:10:05.720,0:10:08.100
The Man of God has given her the instruction of what to do.

0:10:08.100,0:10:10.640
That she should ask the man to stretch out both hands

0:10:10.640,0:10:14.760
and she should spray the Anointing Water on both hands of the man.

0:10:14.760,0:10:18.460
On both hands, in the name of Jesus.

0:10:21.420,0:10:24.240
Be free in the name of Jesus!

0:10:24.240,0:10:33.720
Be delivered in the name of Jesus!

0:10:33.720,0:10:39.700
Be free in Jesus' name!

0:10:39.700,0:10:42.600
Responding to the power in the Anointing Water.

0:10:42.600,0:10:44.600
See what is happening to the man.

0:10:44.600,0:10:48.000
He can no longer hold himself. See what is happening to him.

0:10:48.000,0:10:51.600
Spinning around.

0:10:51.600,0:10:55.140
We can see what is happening to him now.

0:10:55.140,0:10:56.400
Down he goes.

0:10:57.020,0:11:00.300
Ok. Go near to him and spray his hands on the floor.

0:11:05.680,0:11:08.540
Watch the screen and see what is happening to the man,

0:11:08.540,0:11:11.940
immediately the Anointing Water touched his hands.

0:11:11.940,0:11:15.940
You can see what is happening to him right now -

0:11:15.940,0:11:18.180
shaking uncontrollably.

0:11:18.180,0:11:20.780
And shout the name Jesus, Madam.

0:11:20.780,0:11:22.780
In the name of Jesus!

0:11:33.540,0:11:37.540
That is deliverance. Watch your screen.

0:11:45.760,0:11:48.820
Give thanks to God for what the Lord has done in our lives today

0:11:48.820,0:11:50.500
and for what you have seen.
