0:00:00.000,0:00:03.760
Come here.
Come.

0:00:03.760,0:00:05.700
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:05.700,0:00:08.000
Come on.

0:00:08.000,0:00:11.160
Who is she to you?

0:00:11.160,0:00:14.220
That's my ex-wife of 30 years.

0:00:14.220,0:00:19.100
There is a divorce and you are the cause.

0:00:19.100,0:00:20.300
Yes.

0:00:20.300,0:00:21.660
You are the cause of divorcing.

0:00:21.660,0:00:22.820
Yes, I am.

0:00:22.820,0:00:26.640
That is why I have to talk to her; she's the issue.

0:00:26.640,0:00:30.040
If she says, "Yes" it's yes;
if she says "No", it's no.

0:00:30.040,0:00:31.380
You are the cause of all this.

0:00:31.380,0:00:32.280
I am the cause.

0:00:32.280,0:00:35.440
At a time, God was blessing you with money.

0:00:35.440,0:00:35.980
Yes.

0:00:35.980,0:00:37.400
So, you messed up the whole thing.

0:00:37.400,0:00:38.460
Yes, I messed up.

0:00:38.460,0:00:41.960
A time when things were very difficult, she was with you.

0:00:41.960,0:00:42.700
Yes.

0:00:42.700,0:00:48.440
Now, things are good, you go out looking for women.

0:00:48.440,0:00:51.040
Yes.

0:00:51.040,0:00:52.700
That destroyed your marriage.

0:00:52.700,0:00:53.900
It destroyed me.

0:00:53.900,0:00:58.360
You did not keep your marriage and this is a woman who can take care of you.

0:00:58.360,0:01:03.200
Because you have tasted many women who are zero.

0:01:03.200,0:01:06.100
I wasted 30 years.

0:01:06.100,0:01:11.340
You have not seen anything unless God restores this marriage.

0:01:11.340,0:01:16.640
I can't say this in the presence of my sister - I need to you see you.

0:01:16.640,0:01:17.960
This is sickness.

0:01:17.960,0:01:18.700
Yes.

0:01:18.700,0:01:20.660
This is sickness.

0:01:20.660,0:01:23.000
It is sickness.

0:01:23.000,0:01:30.960
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:30.960,0:01:36.420
Emmanuel!
(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)

0:01:36.420,0:01:42.760
My name is Velma Garland and the man standing next to me is my ex-husband Carl Garland.

0:01:42.760,0:01:46.960
We are from the USA.

0:01:46.960,0:01:53.720
Last Sunday was the first time I attended The SCOAN.

0:01:53.720,0:02:01.540
The Prophet came over to us and he began to prophecy to me.

0:02:01.540,0:02:07.460
He told my husband that there was trouble.

0:02:07.460,0:02:13.840
He said that there was a divorce.

0:02:13.840,0:02:16.880
He asked where was the letter.

0:02:16.880,0:02:20.280
He was talking about the letter of divorce.

0:02:20.280,0:02:24.960
He looked at my husband and said, "You caused it".

0:02:24.960,0:02:31.200
He said, "When you had nothing she was with you

0:02:31.200,0:02:41.140
but when God start blessing and the money start coming in you start going out looking for other women".

0:02:41.140,0:02:45.000
This leads me to my problem.

0:02:45.000,0:02:50.040
I have been married to Carl for 30 years.

0:02:50.040,0:02:56.080
What the man of God said was very very true and accurate.

0:02:56.080,0:03:05.880
Women were calling me and leaving messages on my phone.

0:03:05.880,0:03:12.800
One even had the nerve to tell me that she'd been seeing him for 7 years.

0:03:12.800,0:03:17.880
One left a message and she has some things to say too.

0:03:17.880,0:03:20.980
I asked him about this.

0:03:20.980,0:03:30.220
He promised that he would never do it again but then it happened again.

0:03:30.220,0:03:37.380
I believed him because at that point we'd been together like 25 years.

0:03:37.380,0:03:41.480
We went on but then it happened again.

0:03:41.480,0:03:49.820
Because of his numerous affairs and his dealing with other women

0:03:49.820,0:03:58.080
he made me sick and this led to our divorce.

0:03:58.080,0:04:05.740
This divorce happened last year.

0:04:05.740,0:04:18.740
In the process of this year I was looking on TV and I came across Youtube and I saw Emmanuel TV.

0:04:18.740,0:04:23.980
I was watching the testimonies there, which were very compelling.

0:04:23.980,0:04:29.460
I live in US and this is Africa - I have never been to Africa.

0:04:29.460,0:04:32.600
I said, "If he can help those people..."

0:04:32.600,0:04:39.160
I was watching deliverances and demons being manifested.

0:04:39.160,0:04:47.700
These people were talking about how God had reconciled them after the deliverance.

0:04:47.700,0:04:57.920
I felt like if I could get here that maybe God could do the same thing for me and my marriage.

0:04:57.920,0:05:04.020
When I got here - this was the first time I had ever been here -

0:05:04.020,0:05:13.280
he laid hands on us and especially with my husband - he got delivered.

0:05:13.280,0:05:18.980
It started last Sunday - I started to see a change in him.

0:05:18.980,0:05:25.400
True repentance - I mean true repentance

0:05:31.500,0:05:33.560
and humility.

0:05:33.560,0:05:39.500
The arrogance was not there.

0:05:39.500,0:05:42.660
The affection for me came back.

0:05:42.660,0:05:48.000

Prophecy Testimony

0:05:48.000,0:05:55.140
He acts like he cares for me again.

0:05:55.140,0:06:01.360
Yesterday, we went to the prayer mountain.

0:06:01.360,0:06:07.420
At that prayer mountain we began praying.

0:06:07.420,0:06:18.520
I began to speak, as we were praying, in my heavenly voice because he didn't have the Holy Ghost.

0:06:18.520,0:06:27.640
Next thing I know; he starts speaking in tongues - he got filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:06:27.640,0:06:29.700
You listen to that?

0:06:29.700,0:06:37.460
You know; I told you that satan cursed people to lose control.

0:06:37.460,0:06:42.780
The man, my brother, was losing control in the past.

0:06:42.780,0:06:46.720
He lost control.

0:06:46.720,0:06:51.180
But now he has come to his senses.

0:06:51.180,0:06:57.820
He realized that what he had been doing in the past was wrong.

0:06:57.820,0:06:59.880
Now you can see.

0:06:59.880,0:07:07.540
This is why you have to cultivate and have a habit of forgiveness.

0:07:07.540,0:07:10.220
Forgive your neighbour.

0:07:10.220,0:07:24.260
What they have done to you is not out of hatred but they lost control.

0:07:24.260,0:07:26.480
Tell your neighbour, "Forgive your neighbour."

0:07:26.480,0:07:28.800
[Forgive your neighbour.]

0:07:28.800,0:07:31.620
You can see now.

0:07:31.620,0:07:33.400
He lost control.

0:07:33.400,0:07:37.100
Now he has come to his senses and realized...

0:07:37.100,0:07:40.760
Look at the testimony the wife is giving about him.

0:07:40.760,0:07:43.500
She says she was shocked.

0:07:43.500,0:07:59.000
When you were under bondage and you are released, you will see the true colours of yourself.

0:07:59.000,0:08:05.160
This is why the Lord says, "Forgive and forget".

0:08:05.160,0:08:10.640
You have to learn to forgive.

0:08:10.640,0:08:12.660
OK?

0:08:12.660,0:08:21.280
Whatever anyone might have done to you; please forgive and forget.

0:08:21.280,0:08:23.300
Hallelujah.

0:08:23.300,0:08:31.480
After the prayer, after touching him - I know it is not easy when you are not delivered.

0:08:31.480,0:08:36.720
Forgiveness must come through deliverance.

0:08:36.720,0:08:40.780
You cannot just say, "I forgive" - because it is not natural.

0:08:40.780,0:08:43.800
What happened to you is not natural.

0:08:43.800,0:08:48.600
It is spiritual and you must be released.

0:08:48.600,0:08:53.060
When you are released you will see the need of forgiveness.

0:08:53.060,0:08:57.080
Man of God, here is the divorce letter that you spoke about.

0:08:57.080,0:09:03.840
OK, this is the divorce letter I told about, "Look, this is the divorce. Where is the letter?"

0:09:03.840,0:09:04.760
Can you see?

0:09:04.760,0:09:15.460
I want to know if the decision that I made to divorce him is wrong or right and what has God have to say

0:09:15.460,0:09:18.580
about this reconciliation.

0:09:18.580,0:09:20.840
Yes, I'm happy.

0:09:20.840,0:09:26.440
Now, you have realized yourself and himself has realized himself.

0:09:26.440,0:09:29.800
He lost control then.

0:09:29.800,0:09:33.920
That is why he committed that shameful acts.

0:09:33.920,0:09:36.520
Now, we have realized ourselves.

0:09:36.520,0:09:39.520
Love is natural.

0:09:39.520,0:09:42.060
It is from the heart.

0:09:42.060,0:09:48.220
When the love comes from the heart no one can stop it.

0:09:48.220,0:09:53.660
Now, the love that comes from the heart is what you have to exercise.

0:09:53.660,0:09:59.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:59.280,0:10:08.620
Not because he says sorry, cries or suffers.

0:10:08.620,0:10:12.740
Because of this, because of that  - no.

0:10:12.740,0:10:19.360
The love that comes from the heart - exercise it.

0:10:19.360,0:10:21.940
That is the love that can build a marriage.

0:10:21.940,0:10:26.820
Marriage is not for a while - it is forever.

0:10:26.820,0:10:32.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:32.180,0:10:39.480
The reason for which many marriages don't last is that this love is not from the heart.

0:10:39.480,0:10:51.500
If the love is from the heart, no matter what happens - the love from the heart will see you through.

0:10:51.500,0:10:58.540
What happened cannot destroy the marriage, cannot separate the marriage.

0:10:58.540,0:11:01.580
God can.

0:11:01.580,0:11:03.120
OK?

0:11:03.120,0:11:07.460
Because the love from the heart is love from God.

0:11:07.460,0:11:11.120
If God says "Yes" no one can say "No".

0:11:11.120,0:11:15.740
When the love comes from the heart, it does not mean there will be no tribulation.

0:11:15.740,0:11:17.820
There will be tribulation.

0:11:17.820,0:11:22.820
There will be all kind of crisis.

0:11:22.820,0:11:32.680
I was telling people yesterday that God's plan for our life causes us to face trouble.

0:11:32.680,0:11:39.980
Tell your neighbour, "God's plan for our life caused us to face trouble".

0:11:39.980,0:11:47.520
Your trouble could be temptation, persecution, sickness, or of any other kind.

0:11:47.520,0:11:55.400
God's plan for our life causes us to face trouble.

0:11:55.400,0:11:59.420
And we are all running for the trouble.

0:11:59.420,0:12:05.220
That trouble is the one that strengthens our life.

0:12:05.220,0:12:07.200
Are you with me there?

0:12:07.200,0:12:08.700
What strengthens our life?

0:12:08.700,0:12:10.500
[Trouble.]

0:12:10.500,0:12:18.200
We run for the very thing that brings strength for our life.

0:12:18.200,0:12:29.860
Tell your neighbour, "We run for the very thing that strengthens our life".

0:12:29.860,0:12:31.740
We run for the trouble.

0:12:31.740,0:12:34.720
Naturally, no one wants trouble.

0:12:34.720,0:12:39.280
Naturally, when you see a trouble coming you have to run.

0:12:39.280,0:12:52.400
It is that trouble that strengthens our life; just as fire strengthens gold, trouble strengthens our life.

0:12:52.400,0:12:56.080
Think about what I said; you will agree with me.

0:12:56.080,0:12:59.680
Just as fire strengthens gold.

0:12:59.680,0:13:04.440
You know; fire removes impurities from gold.

0:13:04.440,0:13:08.800
If not fire you cannot discover pure gold.

0:13:08.800,0:13:11.080
Impurities cover gold.

0:13:11.080,0:13:16.800
But when gold passes through fire, it removes those impurities.

0:13:16.800,0:13:20.660
You will now see a shining gold.

0:13:20.660,0:13:27.380
In the same day problem strengthens your life.

0:13:27.380,0:13:34.240
God's plan for our life causes us to face trouble.

0:13:34.240,0:13:42.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:42.460,0:13:52.620
Tell your neighbour, "God's plan for our life causes us to face problem".

0:13:52.620,0:13:55.860
What is the problem?

0:13:55.860,0:14:01.200
When problem comes and you overcome it - you are promoted.

0:14:01.200,0:14:04.280
It comes, you are promoted.

0:14:04.280,0:14:12.140
Without problem you remain on a spot.

0:14:12.140,0:14:22.260
We run for the very thing that brings strength to our life.

0:14:22.260,0:14:23.680
What is the very thing?

0:14:23.680,0:14:25.680
Problem.

0:14:25.680,0:14:34.820
Your problem could be persecution, hatred, sickness, - just name it.

0:14:34.820,0:14:40.640
Look at homes today: divorce, divorce, divorce...

0:14:40.640,0:14:41.780
What is the cause of divorce?

0:14:41.780,0:14:43.440
Problem.

0:14:43.440,0:14:51.600
When you see a wonderful, successful marriage today...

0:14:51.600,0:15:02.860
When you meet them; in all areas they succeeded: children, home...

0:15:02.860,0:15:04.740
They are at their senior age.

0:15:04.740,0:15:08.660
When you meet them and ask them to counsel you, you ask them how did they manage

0:15:08.660,0:15:13.740
to keep the marriage from the beginning and you refused to divorce and you are at your senior age.

0:15:13.740,0:15:19.340
They will tell you that they have seen a lot in their lives.

0:15:19.340,0:15:24.760
A friend wanted to separate the marriage, an enemy came to separate the marriage,

0:15:24.760,0:15:31.000
satan came to separate the marriage, a lot of lies, a lot of stories.

0:15:31.000,0:15:34.760
Temptation came - we refused to separate.

0:15:34.760,0:15:40.040
Today, this is a wonderful marriage.

0:15:40.040,0:15:49.120
We run for the very thing that brings strength to our life.

0:15:49.120,0:15:50.400
We run for problem.

0:15:50.400,0:15:53.240
When problem comes we try to avoid it.

0:15:53.240,0:15:57.880
Whatever you can do you want to do it.

0:15:57.880,0:16:07.740
When a trouble come in the marriage; "your wife is this" - you, instead of sitting down and know that

0:16:07.740,0:16:10.500
trouble cannot separate a marriage from God,

0:16:10.500,0:16:14.940
you start to worry yourself.

0:16:14.940,0:16:18.800
You are no longer interested in the marriage; you go to another one.

0:16:18.800,0:16:21.640
The same applies to work.

0:16:21.640,0:16:27.220
You have attempted a lot of businesses and jobs.

0:16:27.220,0:16:31.780
You were once an architect, contractor...

0:16:31.780,0:16:33.280
There is nothing you have not done.

0:16:33.280,0:16:39.900
If they look in your pocket they will see different business cards.

0:16:39.900,0:16:41.980
Why?

0:16:41.980,0:16:47.980
Once you attend the business and you run to loss - that is the end of this business.

0:16:47.980,0:16:50.080
You are looking for another business.

0:16:50.080,0:16:51.640
You don't want to hear about any loss.

0:16:51.640,0:16:59.120
And that loss strengthens our life, to succeed.

0:16:59.120,0:17:06.560
Successful businessmen today, chairmen of many companies; when you meet them they will tell you

0:17:06.560,0:17:10.100
a lot of loss they have gone through.

0:17:10.100,0:17:19.040
A lot of "prison", damage, they run into debts, but they stood by.

0:17:19.040,0:17:20.720
You move from one business to another.

0:17:20.720,0:17:22.580
You don't want to hear anything about loss.

0:17:22.580,0:17:24.420
You don't want to hear about shortage.

0:17:24.420,0:17:25.440
You don't want to hear this.

0:17:25.440,0:17:28.580
When you hear about shortage you run, you abandon the business, you run to another.

0:17:28.580,0:17:34.280
You look; my brother is forwarding, he made it - you run to that.

0:17:34.280,0:17:35.700
You abandoned the other one.

0:17:35.700,0:17:38.100
This is why our life is like this.

0:17:38.100,0:17:41.520
There is no such business where you would not face trouble.

0:17:41.520,0:17:44.500
You keep running for trouble.

0:17:44.500,0:17:52.100
Look, you need to go to Heaven, if you say that you don't want to see trouble.

0:17:52.100,0:17:53.260
I have answered your question now.

0:17:53.260,0:17:55.120
Yes, you have.

0:17:55.120,0:17:59.500
If you are looking for a smooth marriage you need to go to Heaven.

This is one of the things that strengthens marriage.

0:18:14.380,0:18:16.140
Dispute.

0:18:16.140,0:18:17.320
Trouble.

0:18:17.320,0:18:21.580
One of the things that strengthens the marriage.

0:18:21.580,0:18:34.660
When you get to US meet successful aged marriage couple.

0:18:34.660,0:18:44.100
Meet them, let them counsel you; they will tell you what they have gone through in life to maintain their marriage.

0:18:44.100,0:18:47.900
So you may say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:18:47.900,0:18:50.720
This is God's marriage.

0:18:50.720,0:18:53.680
Let me hear from our brother.

0:18:53.680,0:18:55.360
My name is Carl Garland.

0:18:55.360,0:18:58.640
I am from the USA.

0:18:58.640,0:19:09.180
I just want to say that last Sunday we were sitting over there and the man of God came and touched me.

0:19:09.180,0:19:16.580
He prophesied to me that he knew that there was a divorce.

0:19:16.580,0:19:27.700
He said that I had a lot of money and I was messing with a lot of women.

0:19:27.700,0:19:29.640
He said he saw a disease.

0:19:29.640,0:19:33.520
Look, we are not even expecting you to talk.

0:19:33.520,0:19:35.620
This is our mum here.

0:19:35.620,0:19:37.660
Once we hear from our mum we are OK.

0:19:37.660,0:19:42.000
Can you just give a hug to my mum and say "Thank You, Jesus".

0:19:42.000,0:19:43.860
Give her a hug.

0:19:50.480,0:19:52.840
Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...

0:19:52.840,0:19:53.800
I love you.

0:19:53.800,0:19:55.020
I want to tell...

0:19:55.020,0:19:56.720
Look, my brother.

0:19:56.720,0:20:01.440
I want to tell you that this woman is your mum.

0:20:01.440,0:20:05.760
Try to be a father.

0:20:05.760,0:20:06.540
OK?

0:20:06.540,0:20:07.400
Thank you.

0:20:07.400,0:20:14.920
He has gone through a lot of pain but because of Jesus he put everything behind.

0:20:18.900,0:20:21.560
Thank you, man of God.

0:20:21.560,0:20:23.280
Thank you.

0:20:23.280,0:20:28.080
Man of God, I want to thank you for reconciling me with my wife.

0:20:28.080,0:20:34.080
I also want to say that I love you and I am very sorry.

0:20:34.080,0:20:37.880
And I want to say to you - listen to me:

0:20:37.880,0:20:46.360
that the marriage has been settled does not mean that the crisis has stopped.

0:20:46.360,0:20:49.820
There will be trouble and trouble and trouble...

0:20:49.820,0:20:54.340
The more the trouble the more your strength.

0:20:54.340,0:20:56.120
Strength comes to marriage through what?

0:20:56.120,0:20:57.260
[Trouble.]

0:20:57.260,0:20:59.840
Through trouble.

0:20:59.840,0:21:02.900
No temptation can separate this marriage.

0:21:02.900,0:21:04.300
[Amen.]

0:21:09.060,0:21:12.860
Instead; the temptation will strengthen it.

0:21:12.860,0:21:17.560
As disagreement comes, strength comes.

0:21:17.560,0:21:24.400
Disagreement - agreement.

0:21:24.400,0:21:27.440
That is just life.

0:21:27.440,0:21:29.780
OK.

0:21:29.780,0:21:30.740
Thank you very much.

0:21:30.740,0:21:33.000
I want to meet you for counseling.

0:21:33.000,0:21:34.080
OK?

0:21:34.080,0:21:34.700
Thank you.

0:21:34.700,0:21:35.700
Give me your hand

0:21:35.700,0:21:36.340
Thank you.

0:21:36.340,0:21:39.680
Thank you so much.

0:21:39.680,0:21:41.520
Thank you.

0:22:00.060,0:22:01.200
Brother, come.

0:22:01.200,0:22:04.320
What would you do with those troubles coming to you?

0:22:04.320,0:22:08.680
I would not allow it to make me lose control.

0:22:08.680,0:22:12.520
Yes, you would not allow trouble to overwhelm you.

0:22:12.520,0:22:15.380
Because when it overwhelms you, you lose control.

0:22:15.380,0:22:16.160
Yes.

0:22:16.160,0:22:22.040
When something overwhelms you, like wine - when you are taking alcohol.

0:22:22.040,0:22:27.760
Your eyes begin to shine.

0:22:27.760,0:22:37.480
I know, when you sit sober with people taking alcohol - they will talk well after first cup.

0:22:37.480,0:22:42.760
But the second cup - you see their eyes becoming bright.

0:22:42.760,0:22:46.520
You ask them, "Are you all right?"

0:22:46.520,0:22:51.140
When trouble overwhelm you it takes control.

0:22:51.140,0:22:53.820
If you don't allow it to overwhelm you...

0:22:53.820,0:22:56.520
How can the trouble overwhelm us?

0:22:56.520,0:23:11.000
When we begin to look at the trouble, giving respect to the trouble as it is a way of life.

0:23:11.000,0:23:15.360
When it comes the end has not come.

0:23:15.360,0:23:19.580
You look at this trouble.

0:23:19.580,0:23:27.880
Remember, when you were in your mother's womb, when you were an embryo;

0:23:27.880,0:23:34.240
if trouble could not destroy you then - is it now that trouble would destroy you?
