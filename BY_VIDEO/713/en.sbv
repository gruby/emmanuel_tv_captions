Christians should not pull out of relationships or                                                    church under any circumstance.

0:00:17.720,0:00:27.460
Such as misunderstanding, disagreement, great conflict or taking offenses.

0:00:27.960,0:00:34.540
Whether you are right or wrong, we should wait patiently                                                          for God's release.

0:00:35.060,0:00:43.200
