During the Super Friday Healing and Deliverance service at the SCOAN,

0:00:05.000,0:00:09.280
while Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying, a young man cried out.

0:00:16.240,0:00:17.600
Come here. What did you say?

0:00:17.600,0:00:22.020
Two of them. This is my senior brother's daughter. Her father died in 2004.

0:00:22.020,0:00:24.880
This one is our last born. They killed my mother.

0:00:24.880,0:00:25.940
Who killed your mother?

0:00:25.940,0:00:28.720
The two of them. They have confessed that they have killed my mother.

0:00:28.720,0:00:32.180
Ok. If they confessed to you, can they confess to me?

0:00:32.180,0:00:34.680
Do you have any right to say that somebody is a witch?

0:00:34.680,0:00:39.800
You have been witnessing since morning when witches themselves said that they are witches

0:00:39.800,0:00:41.100
and they will demonstrate it

0:00:41.100,0:00:44.240
and if they are not, the Spirit of God will say:,"No, they are not".

0:00:44.260,0:00:47.300
But it is not for you now to speak on their behalf.

0:00:47.380,0:00:50.640
Do not speak on their behalf saying that they are witches.

0:00:50.640,0:00:54.080
You can only say that they have problems, either sickness or disease

0:00:54.080,0:00:57.500
but for you to say that they are witches, are you a prophet?

0:00:57.540,0:00:58.240
I'm not.

0:00:58.240,0:01:01.300
How are you my brother?

0:01:01.360,0:01:04.500
They are being tortured.

0:01:04.580,0:01:06.700
Psychological torture.

0:01:06.740,0:01:09.300
Your name?

0:01:09.380,0:01:10.800
Which school are you going to?

0:01:10.800,0:01:11.900
Primary school.

0:01:11.900,0:01:13.620
Do you understand what he is saying?

0:01:13.620,0:01:14.480
Yes.

0:01:14.480,0:01:16.420
And you. Do you understand what your brother is saying?

0:01:16.420,0:01:17.400
Yes.

0:01:17.440,0:01:19.340
What is he saying?

0:01:19.340,0:01:21.200
He says that I'm a witch.

0:01:21.280,0:01:22.320
He said that you are a witch?

0:01:22.340,0:01:23.700
Yes.

0:01:23.780,0:01:25.420
Are you a witch?

0:01:25.420,0:01:27.200
Yes.

0:01:27.240,0:01:29.200
You are not a witch.

0:01:29.220,0:01:30.900
It's a torture.

0:01:30.980,0:01:33.100
He's afraid. You can hear the tone.

0:01:33.140,0:01:36.200
He said, " Yes".

0:01:36.220,0:01:38.700
He's not a witch.

0:01:38.760,0:01:40.760
Your brother said that you are a witch.

0:01:40.760,0:01:41.260
Yes.

0:01:41.260,0:01:42.560
Are you a witch?

0:01:42.560,0:01:43.320
Yes.

0:01:43.320,0:01:45.140
Do you want to hear from me?

0:01:45.140,0:01:45.900
Yes, man of God.

0:01:45.900,0:01:49.200
I will pray for you people. These two are not witches.

0:01:49.240,0:01:51.720
I am the only person in our family that remains.

0:01:51.720,0:01:53.160
All my seniors have died.

0:01:53.160,0:01:56.400
I am the only person that can take care of them. They have rejected them.

0:01:56.400,0:01:59.300
Ok. Only you remain in the family?

0:01:59.300,0:01:59.800
Yes.

0:01:59.800,0:02:01.160
Everybody else has died?

0:02:01.160,0:02:01.840
Yes.

0:02:01.840,0:02:03.380
And you are the only person that is taking care of them?

0:02:03.380,0:02:04.640
Yes. We're three at home.

0:02:04.640,0:02:06.900
Ok, then I will join your family.

0:02:06.900,0:02:08.900
Thank you, man of God.

0:02:08.980,0:02:12.200
Thank you Jesus!

0:02:12.280,0:02:14.040
Tell me, how do you want me to join?

0:02:14.040,0:02:17.680
Do you want to take me as your senior brother or your junior brother

0:02:17.680,0:02:19.980
or do you want to take me as your son?

0:02:19.980,0:02:25.000
As my father.

0:02:25.040,0:02:28.020
Ok. Jesus will be our father.

0:02:28.040,0:02:32.200
So, we will just be members of the family.

0:02:32.260,0:02:38.700
I want to see you and see what we can do to move the family forward.

0:02:38.780,0:02:39.900
Thank you, Jesus!

0:02:39.900,0:02:41.980
What are you doing for a living?

0:02:41.980,0:02:44.500
Somebody borrowed me money to sell recharge cards -

0:02:44.500,0:02:45.720
since my mother has gone.

0:02:45.720,0:02:48.680
Ok, someone borrowed you money to sell recharge cards.

0:02:48.680,0:02:49.340
Yes.

0:02:49.360,0:02:50.680
And that is what you are doing?

0:02:50.680,0:02:52.140
Have you returned the money?

0:02:52.140,0:02:52.640
No.

0:02:52.640,0:02:53.640
You have not returned the money?

0:02:53.640,0:02:54.320
Yes.

0:02:54.320,0:02:56.160
How much did the person borrow you?

0:02:56.160,0:02:59.800
He borrowed me 30,000 naira.

0:02:59.820,0:03:01.940
I borrowed some money and joined the money together and took

0:03:01.940,0:03:03.400
them from Akwa Ibom to this place.

0:03:03.480,0:03:04.860
From which state are you?

0:03:04.860,0:03:06.600
Akwa Ibom.

0:03:06.680,0:03:08.080
They are not witches.

0:03:08.080,0:03:13.860
It is the situation in the house that makes everybody a witch or a wizard.

0:03:13.860,0:03:20.460
And their situation is so grave that, if they grow big in the nearest future

0:03:20.460,0:03:24.300
and you people are not delivered today, they will call you a wizard.

0:03:24.300,0:03:26.880
Assume that you are in their position and they are in your position.

0:03:26.880,0:03:29.400
They too will call you wizard.

0:03:29.480,0:03:32.400
They are looking for where the problem is coming from

0:03:32.400,0:03:34.900
and anybody can be a scapegoat.

0:03:45.940,0:03:52.300
Who is a witch now?

0:03:52.360,0:03:55.500
Who is a wizard?

0:03:55.580,0:03:59.600
You are free. You are all children of God.

0:03:59.620,0:04:01.900
Live at peace. Thank you.

0:04:01.960,0:04:04.860
L'homme de Dieu vient de declarer que l'enfant n'est pas un sorcier -

0:04:04.860,0:04:07.200
contrairement a ce que la famille disait.

0:04:07.260,0:04:14.300
Thank you, Jesus!

0:04:14.380,0:04:18.100
Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for the three from Akwa Ibom state

0:04:18.100,0:04:23.100
and declared that the little boy and girl accused of witchcraft were innocent

0:04:23.160,0:04:25.900
and that they are all children of God.

0:04:25.980,0:04:31.680
On Sunday, during the live service, Prophet T.B. Joshua brought their alarming case

0:04:31.680,0:04:35.400
to the attention of the congregation.

0:04:35.440,0:04:42.500
Two weeks ago, there was a brother that was called out

0:04:42.560,0:04:50.200
and claimed that the two children are witches and wizards.

0:04:50.280,0:04:54.000
After that deliverance, we began to probe into the matter.

0:04:54.020,0:04:56.500
It was a horrible issue.

0:04:56.580,0:04:59.100
Let's hear from the brother.

0:04:59.120,0:05:03.800
My name is Asuquo Etim Okon. I'm from Akwo Ibom state.

0:05:03.820,0:05:06.000
I'm 23 years old.

0:05:06.000,0:05:10.600
Last Friday, I came here to attend the prayer line

0:05:10.660,0:05:12.700
because of these two children.

0:05:12.700,0:05:13.980
They accused them.

0:05:13.980,0:05:16.300
They said that they are the ones that killed my mom.

0:05:16.320,0:05:19.700
I then took them to the Synagogue Church Of All Nations.

0:05:19.700,0:05:25.600
When we were here at the prayer line, the man of God touched my brothers.

0:05:25.680,0:05:30.300
I then shouted, "Please help me, man of God, help my brothers".

0:05:30.340,0:05:33.200
They accused them, saying that they are witches.

0:05:33.200,0:05:36.900
The man of God told me that these children are not witches.

0:05:36.900,0:05:40.820
They said that these children are the ones that killed my mom.

0:05:40.820,0:05:42.380
My mother's corpse is on the ground.

0:05:42.380,0:05:44.100
They never buried my mother's corpse.

0:05:44.100,0:05:45.660
They didn't take her to the mortuary.

0:05:45.660,0:05:48.400
They embalmed my mother and kept her body in the house.

0:05:48.420,0:05:52.100
So, these children, my father sent them away.

0:05:52.120,0:05:57.200
They rejected us and we have nowhere to go - nowhere to live.

0:05:57.220,0:06:02.700
I struggled to get money to try and do my mother's burial.

0:06:02.720,0:06:03.900
There was no money.

0:06:03.980,0:06:06.140
So, my friends started to call me.

0:06:06.140,0:06:10.040
They said that since my mother sent those ones out of the house,

0:06:10.040,0:06:13.800
they used to sleep under the transformer, in the rain.

0:06:13.860,0:06:15.360
You can look at their body now.

0:06:15.360,0:06:20.400
When you see their body, you would see that these people used to sleep under the transformer.

0:06:20.440,0:06:24.040
So, when they called me, they said that I should go back to our village

0:06:24.040,0:06:25.600
because there is something that they used to give them.

0:06:25.680,0:06:33.200
If you are really a witch, when they give you that thing, you are going to eat it and you wil die.

0:06:33.280,0:06:35.560
If you are not a witch, you will vomit it.

0:06:35.560,0:06:41.600
And if you are an enemy, when they give that thing to you, you will be able to pass through it and kill them.

0:06:41.600,0:06:47.660
So, I thought that if I do this thing for these children... . Especially this one.

0:06:47.660,0:06:50.680
Before my senior brother died, he left him in my hands

0:06:50.680,0:06:56.700
and said that as I am the only person that remains now, anywhere I go I should go with this one.

0:06:56.740,0:07:00.200
I thought of this thing and borrowed money.

0:07:00.200,0:07:05.900
When I go to town and visit my uncle, I used to watch Emmanuel TV.

0:07:05.940,0:07:10.820
I then planned and borrowed money everywhere to take them to this place.

0:07:10.820,0:07:12.500
That is why I am here.

0:07:12.540,0:07:15.600
My mother's dead body is on the ground since March

0:07:15.600,0:07:17.320
because they never burried my mom.

0:07:17.320,0:07:19.920
No one can buy a coffin to bury my mom.

0:07:19.920,0:07:22.440
I'm the only person that can take care of that.

0:07:22.440,0:07:24.100
I'm suffering. I'm jobless.

0:07:24.180,0:07:32.600
Did you listen to that? He said that his mother is late. The body is still ... where?

0:07:32.600,0:07:36.380
She's in the house. The body is not in the mortuary because there is no money

0:07:36.380,0:07:37.980
for me to take her to the mortuary.

0:07:37.980,0:07:39.520
The body is still inside the room?

0:07:39.580,0:07:40.400
Yes.

0:07:40.460,0:07:42.900
So, they cannot carry the body to the mortuary?

0:07:42.960,0:07:43.540
Yes.

0:07:43.580,0:07:44.260
Since when?

0:07:44.620,0:07:47.900
Since March.

0:07:47.960,0:07:52.180
This is my brother that used to light a lantern in that house in the evening

0:07:52.180,0:07:56.500
so that rats would not eat the dead body.

0:07:56.520,0:07:59.400
He said that this is the brother that lights lantern.

0:07:59.460,0:08:00.200
Yes.

0:08:00.240,0:08:01.200
In the house?

0:08:01.200,0:08:01.720
Yes.

0:08:01.720,0:08:04.120
So, that rats will not eat the dead body?

0:08:04.180,0:08:06.000
Yes.

0:08:06.020,0:08:08.000
From which state?

0:08:08.000,0:08:09.200
Akwa Ibom

0:08:09.280,0:08:15.800
So, I want those who have the heart for this situation to join me.

0:08:15.800,0:08:17.600
Those from Akwa Ibom state.

0:08:17.620,0:08:22.620
You come forward, and I will support you.

0:08:22.620,0:08:26.020
When they are going tomorrow, you can follow them to that community

0:08:26.100,0:08:28.740
and help them with whatever they need to do with the body.

0:08:29.020,0:08:32.860
If they still need more money to do the necessary and bury the woman

0:08:33.300,0:08:35.880
and restore this family back.

0:08:42.340,0:08:43.600
They are too little.

0:08:43.600,0:08:47.760
So, no matter what we give, if we do not follow them to their community

0:08:47.760,0:08:54.440
and stand by as a family to support the boy, I don't think that we have done anything at all.

0:08:54.440,0:08:59.700
So, people from Akwa Ibom, I know that they are here, and they are ready to join me

0:08:59.700,0:09:02.000
to help this family.

0:09:02.040,0:09:04.500
Our Lord Jesus Christ will lead us.

0:09:04.540,0:09:11.520
Let's hear from the little boy that used to light the lamp.

0:09:11.520,0:09:15.360
Yes, I am the one that lights the lamp. When there is no light,

0:09:15.360,0:09:21.000
the rats will eat my mother. That's why every night, I used to light the lamp.

0:09:21.040,0:09:23.280
You have heard it from the younger brother.

0:09:23.280,0:09:27.800
He said he is the one that used to light the lamp every night when there is no light

0:09:27.800,0:09:32.200
so that the rats would not eat the corpse of the mother.

0:09:32.240,0:09:36.260
You mentioned that you borrowed 30,000 naira.

0:09:36.280,0:09:46.100
Give him 300,000 naira and 30,000 naira to go and pay the debt.

0:09:46.100,0:09:47.480
Give them six bags of rice.

0:09:47.480,0:09:51.000
Thank you, man of God.

0:09:51.060,0:09:52.700
Thank you, Jesus!

0:09:52.720,0:09:56.540
Let them know that these children are not witches

0:09:56.540,0:10:00.920
because they thought that these children were the ones who killed the mother.

0:10:00.960,0:10:03.040
There's nothing like that.

0:10:03.040,0:10:05.200
Take care of the home.

0:10:05.200,0:10:06.400
Thank you.

0:10:08.580,0:10:12.600
The sum of 300,000 naira as a cash gift.

0:10:12.600,0:10:18.480
It has been handed to the brother an additional 30,000 naira which is a debt owned by him.

0:10:18.480,0:10:21.900
He said that he used the money to buy recharge cards to take care of the brothers and sisters

0:10:21.900,0:10:24.060
that were accused of witchcraft.

0:10:24.060,0:10:27.400
They had accused them of being the ones responsible for the death of their mother.

0:10:27.400,0:10:30.940
The corpse of their mother is still right in their home,

0:10:30.940,0:10:34.220
and the brother has to put on lantern every evening

0:10:34.220,0:10:38.280
to chase away the rats so that the corpse of the mother would not be eaten by rats.

0:10:38.280,0:10:43.500
The man of God has given the sum of 300,000 naira as a cash gift to them,

0:10:43.500,0:10:48.600
and also 30,000 naira for him to pay back his debt.

0:10:48.660,0:10:51.800
Man of God, God bless you!

0:10:51.800,0:10:54.420
Such a horrible case.

0:10:54.420,0:10:58.680
Due to the statement brought by the allegation of witchcraft on their family

0:10:58.680,0:11:03.740
and lack of finances, the dead body of their mother has not been buried

0:11:03.740,0:11:09.220
but was kept in a room in the family house for the past six months.

0:11:09.220,0:11:12.820
Every night one of the children would enter the dead mother's room

0:11:12.820,0:11:19.700
and light a lantern in order to prevent rats from eating the corpse of their mother.

0:11:19.720,0:11:21.800
After they had stated thieir case,

0:11:21.800,0:11:29.200
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave Asuquo and the family the sum of 300,000 naira, six bags of rice

0:11:29.240,0:11:32.260
and a Holy Bible to help take care of the family

0:11:32.260,0:11:38.600
and additional 30,000 naira to pay off the debt Asuquo owed.

0:11:38.640,0:11:46.100
Leaving The SCOAN,  the Etim Okon family accompanied by the Emmanuel TV team

0:11:46.100,0:11:51.740
embarked on their journey to Akwa Ibom state on a mission to bury their late mother

0:11:51.740,0:11:57.740
whose corpse has been lying abandoned in a room for six long months

0:11:57.740,0:12:04.200
and to reconcile the feuding family, following allegations of witchcraft.

0:12:04.280,0:12:06.600
My name is Asuquo Etim Okon.

0:12:06.660,0:12:08.600
I'm from Akwa Ibom.

0:12:08.640,0:12:11.400
I'm 23 years old.

0:12:11.480,0:12:17.400
These are my brothers and sisters and our father and mother in the Lord.

0:12:17.400,0:12:21.780
The man of God (T.B. Joshua) has sent them to come with us

0:12:21.780,0:12:26.380
to our village for the burial of our mother.

0:12:26.380,0:12:28.340
My name is George Udoh.

0:12:28.340,0:12:32.320
The man of God selected us to accompany the children

0:12:32.320,0:12:35.180
to go and reconcile both families

0:12:35.180,0:12:37.400
so that we can do the burial of the mother

0:12:37.400,0:12:42.120
who died in March this year and up till now, has not been buried.

0:12:42.120,0:12:46.400
So, we thank T.B. Joshua for what he has done for Akwa Ibom state.

0:14:15.320,0:14:21.960
Knowing that their journey would break the yoke of shame and separation within the Etim Okon family,

0:14:21.960,0:14:24.580
satan tried to disrupt the mission.

0:14:24.580,0:14:32.960
Due to adverse weather conditions and bad roads, the vehicle was stuck for almost three hours.

0:14:32.960,0:14:40.120
But as Christians, we know that hard times may test us but cannot destroy us.

0:14:40.120,0:14:43.920
Because the team was carrying out an assignment from God,

0:14:43.920,0:14:47.540
no matter what constituted the obstacle on their way,

0:14:47.540,0:14:49.760
they could not be stopped.

0:16:49.620,0:16:55.080
After much effort, hard work and perseverance, the vehicle was freed

0:16:55.080,0:16:59.840
and the team continued on their journey, knowing that the road to their destination

0:16:59.840,0:17:06.480
would not be a bed of roses but God's grace was sufficient for whatever they faced.

0:17:20.060,0:17:26.120
After a long journey, they finally arrived at the family's village in Akwa Ibom state.

0:17:26.120,0:17:33.080
The very place their dead mother's corpse was laid six months earlier in March,

0:17:33.080,0:17:38.600
and where the stigma of witchcraft had been attached to the family.

0:17:38.660,0:17:42.840
The elder son leads the team by foot into the village.

0:17:56.520,0:18:01.940
Later that night, the team went to the house where the corpse was laid

0:18:07.420,0:18:09.560
This is my father's compound.

0:18:09.560,0:18:12.480
This is the room my mother's corpse is laid.

0:18:12.480,0:18:17.380
Every evening, I used to come and light the lantern here, in this house.

0:18:17.380,0:18:23.900
I light the lantern because when there is no lantern, the rats would eat

0:18:23.900,0:18:29.700
the dead body. That is why I light the lantern every night.

0:18:29.740,0:18:32.300
And that is what you have come to do now?

0:18:32.300,0:18:33.120
Yes.

0:18:38.800,0:18:46.500
Here is the son who had the cruelling task of lighting a lamp in his late mother's room every night -

0:18:46.500,0:18:52.400
in an attempt to stop rats from eating the body.

0:18:52.420,0:18:56.140
The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature

0:18:56.140,0:19:00.300
and may not be suitable for all viewers, especially children.

0:19:00.300,0:19:04.560
But please take note that it is for the glory of God.

0:20:00.100,0:20:04.820
Carrying out his daily task, the boy lights the lamp.

0:20:42.600,0:20:49.540
The next day, the Emmanuel TV team return to meet the whole family, including the father.

0:21:00.820,0:21:02.500
Where are we now?

0:21:02.500,0:21:03.800
My father's house.

0:21:03.800,0:21:05.200
So this is your father's compound?

0:21:05.200,0:21:05.980
Yes.

0:21:08.320,0:21:13.680
Here we are in Akwa Ibom state with Asuquo Etim.

0:21:13.680,0:21:16.000
He said this is his father's compound.

0:21:16.000,0:21:20.540
We have come from The SCOAN - the team that the man of God sent with the evangelists -

0:21:20.540,0:21:25.320
to come for his mother's burial. He also complained to the man of God that

0:21:25.320,0:21:37.400
his mother's corpse lies in this very compound.

0:21:37.400,0:21:41.980
What is happening?

0:21:41.980,0:21:44.120
I am the owner of this house.

0:21:44.120,0:21:46.300
What is happening?

0:21:46.300,0:21:52.880
Mummy, we are coming from The SCOAN -

0:21:52.880,0:21:59.060
all the way from Lagos state.

0:21:59.060,0:22:06.440
These are the evangelists the man of God has sent to come with me for

0:22:06.440,0:22:08.500
my mother's burial.

0:22:08.500,0:22:11.920
I am very happy; thank you.

0:22:11.920,0:22:16.080
She said that she is very glad and happy to see us.

0:22:16.080,0:22:17.940
This is my father's compound.

0:22:17.940,0:22:20.300
This is the room where my mother's corpse lies.

0:22:20.320,0:22:23.040
My mother's dead body is inside the room.

0:22:23.040,0:22:27.900
This is where my father lives. This is my father's parlour.

0:22:27.900,0:22:31.700
For how long has your mother's dead body been in this room?

0:22:31.700,0:22:33.600
For five to six months now.

0:22:33.680,0:22:37.800
Can you tell us: How did you manage to keep your mother's dead body

0:22:37.800,0:22:40.960
for the past five to six months in this room?

0:22:40.960,0:22:45.200
Because there is no money to bury her.

0:22:45.220,0:22:48.900
So what did you do before you could keep her in this room?

0:22:48.900,0:22:52.380
Did you do anything to her body before you could keep her in this room?

0:22:52.400,0:22:53.920
For five to six months?

0:22:53.920,0:22:54.600
Yes.

0:22:54.600,0:22:55.700
What did you do? Tell us.

0:22:55.700,0:22:57.500
They embalmed her.

0:22:57.520,0:23:00.420
My brother used to light a lantern in the house.

0:23:00.420,0:23:00.960
Why?

0:23:00.960,0:23:08.100
Because of rats. If there is no lantern inside the house, rats will disturb

0:23:08.100,0:23:10.780
the dead body. They would eat the dead body.

0:23:10.780,0:23:14.800
This is where my mother's corpse is.

0:23:14.820,0:23:17.700
It is inside.

0:23:17.720,0:23:22.320
This is where I used to come and light the lantern because if there is no light,

0:23:22.320,0:23:25.660
the rats would eat my mother's body.

0:23:43.120,0:23:46.240
So, apart from you, no other person enters this room?

0:23:46.240,0:23:48.100
Nobody.

0:23:48.180,0:23:51.740
The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature

0:23:51.740,0:23:55.760
and may not be suitable for all viewers, especially children.

0:23:55.760,0:23:59.960
But please take note, it is for the glory of God.

0:24:15.220,0:24:31.080
All the expenses are being paid for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:24:31.080,0:24:35.800
This is my father and my step-mother - they are coming now.

0:24:35.800,0:24:42.060
Here comes the father of Asuquo - the man accused of killing his first wife

0:24:42.060,0:24:45.980
and initiating two of his children into witchcraft.

0:24:45.980,0:24:49.100
Why are all these people here?

0:24:54.300,0:24:56.340
Father, we have brought good news to your house.

0:24:56.340,0:25:03.960
Prophet T.B. Joshua sent these people from Lagos state

0:25:03.960,0:25:08.580
to follow me here because of the children that were accused of witchcraft.

0:25:08.580,0:25:11.160
They have come to let the community know that the children are not witches and wizards.

0:25:11.160,0:25:13.760
So, let them come with me and bury my late mother.

0:25:13.760,0:25:18.060
That is the reason I have brought them to come and see you.

0:25:18.060,0:25:24.000
Is this why you brought them? To come and help bury your late mother?

0:25:24.000,0:25:27.900
Thank you.

0:25:27.900,0:25:38.300
I am pleased; I am very happy.

0:25:38.300,0:25:43.340
After explaining to the father why the Emmanuel TV team had come to his house,

0:25:43.340,0:25:48.380
Asuquo proceeds to narrate their experiences at The SCOAN.

0:25:48.380,0:25:54.780
How Prophet T.B. Joshua had blessed them with the sum of 330,000 naira

0:25:54.780,0:25:58.200
and bags of rice upon hearing their ordeal.

0:25:58.200,0:26:03.760
He shows him evangelical items from the Church with Prophet T.B. Joshua's picture on them.

0:26:03.780,0:26:05.880
Let's hear what he has to say.

0:26:07.260,0:26:13.400
My name is Etim Okon Edem.

0:26:13.400,0:26:23.280
I am very glad for what my son has just said.

0:26:23.280,0:26:29.200
It makes me very happy.

0:26:29.260,0:26:33.160
They are all my children.

0:26:33.500,0:26:38.060
What I have to say concerning what the Prophet has said to my children

0:26:38.060,0:26:42.740
is that I am their father.

0:26:42.740,0:26:47.100
The witchcraft spirit they said that they are possessed with,

0:26:47.100,0:26:48.740
they said that I possessed my children with this witchcraft spirit.

0:26:48.740,0:26:52.340
I am prepared to follow my children to go to Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:26:52.340,0:26:55.180
to find out, whether I am the one who gave them the wizard spirit

0:26:55.180,0:26:57.140
or whether I have that wizard spirit.

0:26:57.140,0:27:02.700
I am very happy and at the same time these are my children.

0:27:02.700,0:27:08.560
Regarding the issue of witchcraft of which my children were accused,

0:27:08.560,0:27:12.000
I was not the one who accused my children.

0:27:12.000,0:27:17.180
I was accused of witchcraft and of being the one that possessed my children.

0:27:17.180,0:27:21.960
Now that my children have been vindicated of being witches and wizards,

0:27:21.960,0:27:25.740
I would also like to go and meet that man of God (Prophet T.B. Joshua)

0:27:25.740,0:27:30.640
so that he can also tell the whole world whether I am a wizard or not.

0:27:30.640,0:27:40.900
The late woman is my wife and these are the children she bore for me.

0:27:40.940,0:27:45.100
Five of the children are late and I'm left with five.

0:27:45.140,0:27:48.100
I am Mr Joe Edem.

0:27:48.100,0:27:50.400
I am a native of this land.

0:27:50.480,0:28:00.020
It happened exactly as Mr Etim said that he had been accused of witchcraft.

0:28:00.020,0:28:05.220
Because of that, they also accused Mr Etim of initiating his son

0:28:05.220,0:28:08.600
and this was taken to the market square.

0:28:08.620,0:28:15.460
On the action of the villagers, Mr Etim was beaten because of traditions we normally follow.

0:28:15.460,0:28:20.980
He was asked to give goats and drinks; however, there was no money.

0:28:20.980,0:28:25.200
He used his land just so that he could give these items.

0:28:25.200,0:28:29.200
Then, the next action was that the village gave an ultimatum for Mr Etim

0:28:29.200,0:28:36.660
to bury his wife and whatever concerns the burial, he would bear the full responsibility for that.

0:28:36.660,0:28:38.000
He did so.

0:28:38.000,0:28:40.560
They left the corpse of the wife with him.

0:28:40.560,0:28:43.720
They left the matter like this.

0:28:43.720,0:28:49.480
Even the child standing here, we beat him up severely in this village.

0:28:49.480,0:28:52.120
We were even about to kill him.

0:28:52.120,0:28:58.460
Because of that accusation, these children were driven out of the father's compound.

0:28:58.460,0:29:02.760
They faced a lot of hardship because when they entered someone's house,

0:29:02.760,0:29:05.500
they would pursue them out.

0:29:05.500,0:29:16.000
After some months, this one was accused of being a witch.

0:29:16.020,0:29:21.500
Then, the story became another thing entirely.

0:29:21.500,0:29:25.300
So, they were driven out.

0:29:25.300,0:29:37.800
Even the father - they called him to the village square again to fine, and so he did.

0:29:37.800,0:29:42.740
Mr Etim was accused of being the one that killed his wife

0:29:42.740,0:29:47.460
and that he joined hands with this little child standing here to kill his wife.

0:29:47.460,0:29:53.480
Because of that, they handed everything to him that he should bury his wife alone.

0:29:53.480,0:30:02.320
It was yesterday, about 5 pm that I heard the story of a team coming from Lagos

0:30:02.320,0:30:06.020
to bury this woman that is why I came to see.

0:30:06.020,0:30:08.960
Now when I came here, I saw these two.

0:30:08.960,0:30:15.960
They introduced themselves to me as members of T.B. Joshua's church.

0:30:15.960,0:30:25.160
To say it in brief, I am extremely happy and I am glad because even in this our area,

0:30:25.160,0:30:29.660
nobody would have known this. Since the man of God (Prophet T.B. Joshua) has done this for the community,

0:30:29.660,0:30:38.400
we here in this community give thanks to the Almighty God.

0:30:38.440,0:30:44.500
Mr Joe Edem, a native of Akwa Ibom state, explained how Mr Etim had been accused

0:30:44.500,0:30:51.880
of wizardry after the death of his wife and was publicly beaten and stigmatised in the society.

0:30:51.880,0:30:57.560
Two of his children were subsequently accused of witchcraft, rejected by the community

0:30:57.560,0:31:01.800
and left to their own fate.

0:31:01.880,0:31:06.500
This is the house of the chief of Mr Etim's community.

0:31:06.520,0:31:20.000
Mr Etim has brought the Emmanuel TV team here to formally introduce them to the chief.

0:31:20.080,0:31:33.900
This is the chief of the community taking his seat at the front of the house.

0:31:33.960,0:31:40.340
They explained the reason for their coming was to reconcile the family with the community

0:31:40.340,0:31:43.880
and to seek permission to bury Mr Etim's wife.

0:32:20.640,0:32:27.400
The Chief said that what Mr Etim said is true.

0:32:27.400,0:32:32.500
He was not even around when this problem started. He came and met it.

0:32:32.500,0:32:37.600
They said the man is a wizard and that he is the one that initated his

0:32:37.600,0:32:42.300
two children into that kingdom. The Chief wanted to settle the matter

0:32:42.300,0:32:47.400
but they refused 'til the whole thing scattered.

0:32:47.440,0:32:52.300
Exactly what he told you is what happened.

0:32:52.320,0:32:55.520
They even ordered, due to his stubbornness that

0:32:55.520,0:32:57.480
he should be flogged, and he was flogged.

0:33:06.980,0:33:12.740
They gave him a fine that he was supposed to pay to the village

0:33:12.740,0:33:23.000
but he did not obey. He said that he had no money.

0:33:23.000,0:33:28.080
The villagers went to his house forcefully and brought out

0:33:28.080,0:33:35.700
two she goats and slaughtered them for the villagers to eat.

0:33:35.700,0:33:37.860
They wanted to kill him.

0:33:37.860,0:33:42.620
So, now that we have come from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:33:42.620,0:33:48.280
and the man of God has said those that were accused of being witches and wizards are innocent,

0:33:48.280,0:33:53.220
that they are not witches or wizards and that we should come with those children

0:33:53.220,0:33:56.880
to let the villagers know that they are not witches or wizards

0:33:56.880,0:34:03.640
and also to give their mother a befitting burial. What does the Chief have to say concerning this?

0:34:45.640,0:34:53.700
The Chief says he is sending his regards to the man of God

0:34:53.700,0:35:00.820
for what he has done to recondile the village and the family.

0:35:00.820,0:35:02.220
He is happy.

0:35:02.220,0:35:15.200
The Heavenly Father should give him more anointing, more grace to continue the good work of God.

0:35:15.240,0:35:21.820
We want to ask Mr Etim if he has any other thing he would like to say to the Chief

0:35:21.820,0:35:25.440
concerning the burial of his wife.

0:35:35.340,0:35:39.880
Now that the Chief has agreed that he should bury his wife, he wants to know

0:35:39.880,0:35:44.460
what the items are that they need to buy for the burial.

0:35:44.460,0:35:49.980
The Chief says that if the total amount of money is brought here,

0:35:49.980,0:35:53.060
he will buy everything, settle the villagers,

0:35:53.060,0:35:55.660
so that we can go ahead with the burial.

0:35:55.660,0:35:58.240
The total is 26,000 naira.

0:35:58.560,0:36:03.360
On behalf of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV team,

0:36:03.360,0:36:12.440
this is the money to buy the items that are needed for the final burial of the wife of Mr Etim Okon.

0:36:12.440,0:36:18.360
As the man of God has said that he is going to support Mr Okon's family to make sure

0:36:18.360,0:36:24.280
a befitting burial is given to his wife, this has commenced with this list that was given to us

0:36:24.280,0:36:28.320
by the Chief of this community and now we are handing over the cash to him

0:36:28.320,0:36:30.300
so that he can buy all these items

0:36:30.300,0:36:35.680
and a befitting burial can be given to the wife of Mr Okon in this community.

0:36:38.460,0:36:40.980
He says that we are free to go ahead with the burial,

0:36:40.980,0:36:42.480
that he thanks us so much and

0:36:42.480,0:36:46.300
asks that we should send his regards to the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:36:46.300,0:36:50.880
Having finalised the agreements concerning the burial of Mr Etim's wife,

0:36:50.880,0:36:54.720
the Emmanuel TV team present the Chief of this community

0:36:54.720,0:37:00.120
with two bags of rice as a gift from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:37:00.380,0:37:07.900
Thanking the Chief, the team respectfully take their leave.

0:37:07.900,0:37:14.300
Now, Mr Etim leads the Emmanuel TV team to the chief of the neighbouring community

0:37:14.300,0:37:18.500
who is also the father of his late wife.

0:37:18.500,0:37:23.940
The team comes down from the bus and approaches the house.

0:37:30.860,0:37:35.260
Mr Etim is telling his father-in-law that these people that have come with him

0:37:35.260,0:37:41.560
are the people the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, sent to come

0:37:41.560,0:37:44.580
and help him bury his wife.

0:37:44.580,0:37:50.560
So, as he is here now, the father-in-law should tell him all traditional rites

0:37:50.560,0:37:52.400
so that he will observe it.

0:37:55.200,0:37:58.920
He says his name is Chief Etim Willems.

0:38:08.920,0:38:11.500
After agreeing to bury the deceased,

0:38:11.500,0:38:16.680
they discuss the items required for the burial as their tradition stands.

0:38:35.280,0:38:40.620
The Chief says that if you will comply with him and give him all that he mentioned,

0:38:40.620,0:38:44.380
you are free to go ahead with the burial.

0:38:44.380,0:38:46.220
On behalf of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:38:46.220,0:38:52.900
we want to present the sum of 38,000 naira, which is the cash needed

0:38:52.900,0:38:59.740
to buy the items that were stated by the Chief for the final burial of Mr Etim Okon's wife.

0:38:59.740,0:39:02.340
So, Chief, thank you, sir.

0:39:13.920,0:39:16.740
The Chief says that as you have given him what he requested,

0:39:16.740,0:39:19.800
you can carry on with the burial.

0:39:19.860,0:39:24.280
The Chief says that it is about five months now since their daughter died

0:39:24.280,0:39:27.400
and that there was no way for them to bury her.

0:39:27.480,0:39:30.200
He thanks God for this.

0:39:46.060,0:39:50.780
The Chief says that he is very happy, and that there was no hope of this

0:39:50.780,0:39:56.860
but since the Lord has done this for him, he gives thanks to God.

0:39:57.180,0:40:01.060
The Emmanuel TV team gives the Chief 38,000 naira

0:40:01.060,0:40:06.700
to pay for the burial rites of Mr Etim's wife.

0:40:06.740,0:40:12.560
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent this team to this family

0:40:12.560,0:40:17.440
to inform them that those that were accused of being witches and wizards

0:40:17.440,0:40:19.420
are not witches and wizards

0:40:19.420,0:40:26.160
and also to give a benefitting burial to their daughter who is the wife of Mr Etim Okon

0:40:26.160,0:40:29.100
who is sitting right here.

0:40:29.120,0:40:32.640
With the successful completion of the negotiation,

0:40:32.660,0:40:35.180
the Emmanuel TV team gives the Chief

0:40:35.180,0:40:40.600
the gift of two bags of rice on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:40:40.620,0:40:46.620
He says you should go and tell the man of God that he is happy

0:40:46.620,0:40:52.240
about what he has done for this family. He prays that the blessings of God,

0:40:52.240,0:40:57.200
should remain with him and God should extend his wisdom

0:40:57.200,0:41:03.400
so that he would continue to do that, in Jesus' name. Amen.

0:41:03.480,0:41:07.060
In order to give Mrs Aret a befitting burial,

0:41:07.060,0:41:11.500
the Emmanuel TV team made preparations to purchase a coffin.

0:41:12.920,0:41:17.820
Since the man of God has taken up the responsibility to

0:41:17.820,0:41:21.500
to give your mother a befitting burial, I think the first thing we should do now

0:41:21.500,0:41:24.140
is to get a coffin for her burial so do you have any one

0:41:24.140,0:41:26.720
that can help to go and get the coffin?

0:41:26.720,0:41:27.880
Yes, I have.

0:41:27.880,0:41:37.900
Can you call the person so that we can make preparations towards that?

0:41:37.940,0:41:41.660
We were just talking about his mother's burial

0:41:41.660,0:41:45.660
and we want someone to help us get a coffin and he has called you.

0:41:45.660,0:41:48.740
So, do you have any idea how much a coffin will cost?

0:41:48.740,0:41:55.000
The coffin is 30,000 naira. Together with the transportation, it is 36,000.

0:41:55.000,0:41:58.520
36,000 is for the coffin and the transportation?

0:41:58.520,0:42:00.000
For the coffin and the transportation.

0:42:00.000,0:42:00.500
Ok.

0:42:00.500,0:42:03.780
On behalf of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV team,

0:42:03.780,0:42:06.380
we are giving you the sum of 36,000 naira

0:42:06.380,0:42:10.600
as the cost for the transportation and the coffin to use in burying

0:42:10.600,0:42:17.060
the late mother of Asuquo and also the wife of Mr Etim.

0:42:17.400,0:42:23.260
Prophet T.B. Joshua has taken total responsibility for the funeral expenses.

0:42:23.600,0:42:27.240
He states that the total cost for the coffin, including transportation,

0:42:27.240,0:42:29.860
amounts to 36,000 naira,

0:42:29.860,0:42:34.700
which is promptly given to him by the Emmanuel TV team.

0:42:34.700,0:42:37.720
Later that day...

0:42:45.500,0:42:51.320
Here you can see the respectable coffin brought for the burial of Mrs Aret

0:42:51.320,0:42:55.700
whose corpse has been lying in a room for six months

0:42:55.700,0:42:58.820
due to insufficient funds for her funeral.

0:43:29.240,0:43:35.200
Here is the embalmed corpse - stiff and placed by the window -

0:43:35.200,0:43:39.440
as preparations are made to lower it into the coffin.

0:43:49.880,0:43:55.060
Following cultural traditions, they place Mrs Aret's most beautiful wears

0:43:55.060,0:43:58.680
into the coffin - her final resting place.

0:43:58.680,0:44:05.080
Just consider, if not for God's intervention, the dead body of Mrs Aret

0:44:05.080,0:44:08.360
would be left to a terrible fate.

0:44:20.560,0:44:25.380
Laying the corpse into the coffin, the family members of the deceased

0:44:25.380,0:44:30.140
continue to mourn - overcome with grief.

0:45:22.960,0:45:27.760
Closing the lid of the coffin, they prepare to move it to the church.

0:45:44.620,0:45:50.580
As the rain falls, so do the tears of the grief-stricken family members.

0:46:27.340,0:46:34.280
Here is the funeral procession as the body of Mrs Aret embarks on its final journey,

0:46:34.280,0:46:37.960
heading for the local Apostolic Church.

0:46:55.780,0:47:01.200
They finally arrive at the Apostolic Church where the funeral will take place.

0:47:29.420,0:47:33.800
This is the photograph of Mrs Aret when she was alive.

0:47:33.800,0:47:40.300
A hard-working mother of ten of whom sadly only five remain today.

0:47:40.380,0:47:49.800
The long-awaited funeral service of Mrs Aret finally begins.

0:47:49.880,0:47:55.960
I will now call on another person to take the place of

0:47:55.960,0:48:03.600
thanking God and committing this meeting to God.

0:48:37.000,0:48:42.400
We want to recognise their presence here - the team of evangelists.

0:48:42.400,0:48:47.280
We would like to stand together and greet them as a team.

0:48:47.280,0:48:51.340
Emmanuel TV and the team of evangelists, you are welcome

0:48:51.340,0:48:56.000
in Jesus' name. Let us stand up and greet them.

0:49:04.180,0:49:09.680
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:49:09.680,0:49:14.660
This is our calvary greeting at The SCOAN.

0:49:14.660,0:49:20.840
We bring greetings to all of you from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.

0:49:20.840,0:49:23.100
Amen.

0:49:23.100,0:49:27.220
Brethren, I have a couple of things to tell you.

0:49:27.220,0:49:36.760
Up till now, God is using people to bless other people.

0:49:36.760,0:49:48.400
As we learn from the book of Genesis, God used Joseph to bless Potiphar.

0:49:48.400,0:49:54.980
But here in the land of Abia Limi, God is using the great man of God,

0:49:54.980,0:50:02.640
Prophet T.B. Joshua, to bless the family of Etim Okon.

0:50:02.640,0:50:04.300
Are you still with me?

0:50:04.300,0:50:07.200
Yes.

0:50:07.240,0:50:14.780
The man has never been here but the Spirit of God moved him to bless

0:50:14.780,0:50:21.980
the children of this land and the people of this land. Therefore, I have a couple

0:50:21.980,0:50:26.280
of things to tell you when it is time.

0:50:26.280,0:50:29.400
Amen.

0:50:29.400,0:50:36.800
There was no written biography. I will now call on somebody from the family

0:50:36.800,0:50:43.200
to come and say something about the sister lying before us here.

0:50:43.240,0:50:44.640
Praise the Lord!

0:50:44.640,0:50:45.660
Amen.

0:50:45.660,0:50:46.940
Praise the living God!

0:50:46.940,0:50:47.740
Amen.

0:50:47.740,0:50:50.300
Children of God, praise the Lord!

0:50:50.300,0:50:55.180
Amen.

0:50:55.180,0:50:58.800
This was the only junior sister that I had.

0:50:58.800,0:51:04.880
I had two sisters - a junior sister and one elder sister, which is my senior sister.

0:51:04.880,0:51:11.420
My sister suffered a lot in her marital family.

0:51:11.420,0:51:16.000
It was full of trials and temptations.

0:51:16.000,0:51:25.300
My sister had the sickness that we call "Fire burns twice".

0:51:25.300,0:51:31.640
She had another sickness that removed two of her fingers.

0:51:31.640,0:51:38.420
My sister suffered a lot because of the trials in her marital family.

0:51:38.420,0:51:42.200
She gave birth to ten children. Then, the first five died;

0:51:42.200,0:51:45.080
only the last five are alive.

0:51:46.300,0:51:50.260
Because of that, there were problems in the family.

0:51:50.260,0:51:59.760
My sister then fell sick again.

0:51:59.760,0:52:05.940
Then my brother spent a lot of money on my sister.

0:52:05.940,0:52:14.480
He took her to thirteen places for healing; there was no way.

0:52:14.480,0:52:17.740
Later on, there was no more money.

0:52:17.740,0:52:27.620
Later, my sister gave up. That day, I was at Aba city (Nigeria).

0:52:27.620,0:52:35.100
My senior sister called me. Then I didn't know what to do.

0:52:35.160,0:52:36.440
Praise the living God!

0:52:36.440,0:52:37.700
Amen.

0:52:37.700,0:52:43.880
After five or six months, my sister's dead body was still on the ground,

0:52:43.880,0:52:52.520
with no preparations for burial. Then the Almighty God, the Ancient of days,

0:52:52.520,0:52:59.220
The Lion of the tribe of Judah took the first of the living sons

0:52:59.220,0:53:05.480
to Lagos to meet with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:53:05.480,0:53:10.440
Then the man of God helped us today and did everything

0:53:10.440,0:53:16.100
necessary to give my sister a befitting burial.

0:53:16.100,0:53:20.200
Today, I am so glad that I don't know what to say!

0:53:20.200,0:53:24.900
I really thank my God because He is great, the Author of the Universe.

0:53:29.580,0:53:34.480
I really thank God for the burial of my sister.

0:53:34.480,0:53:41.780
I thank God for T.B. Joshua and God will reward that man abundantly.

0:53:41.780,0:53:44.820
God will give him the grace to do more than this.

0:53:44.820,0:53:47.200
Amen.

0:53:47.240,0:53:53.980
God will give him showers of blessings and open ways for the man

0:53:53.980,0:54:00.440
and the people that accompanied my sister's children all the way from Lagos

0:54:00.440,0:54:06.800
down here to my village in Akwa Ibom state.

0:54:06.820,0:54:09.540
Praise the Lord!

0:54:09.540,0:54:10.600
Amen.

0:54:10.620,0:54:11.540
Hallelujah!

0:54:11.540,0:54:12.220
Amen.

0:54:12.220,0:54:20.820
What you don't even expect, God has done it today.

0:54:20.820,0:54:26.260
That is why we used to say that if God has planned a better thing for you,

0:54:26.260,0:54:29.120
and there is no way for you to get that thing,

0:54:29.120,0:54:33.320
God must cause something to happen, so that

0:54:33.320,0:54:38.720
that thing must draw faster to you and you possess your possession.

0:54:38.720,0:54:40.200
Somebody shout, 'Hallelujah'!

0:54:40.200,0:54:43.500
Hallelujah!

0:54:43.580,0:54:48.460
That is why God caused something to happen in that family

0:54:48.460,0:54:52.700
that took the son of this sister to Lagos.

0:54:52.700,0:54:55.280
Are you still with me?

0:54:55.280,0:55:00.100
This young man traced where the Prophet, the great man of God is.

0:55:00.100,0:55:04.940
He entered there and said, "God, will You open a way for me?"

0:55:04.940,0:55:08.020
God said, "I am the way, the truth and the life.

0:55:08.020,0:55:12.440
Nobody can see the Father, except by Me".

0:55:12.440,0:55:13.440
Hallelujah!

0:55:13.440,0:55:14.060
Amen.

0:55:14.060,0:55:20.700
The young man took a way to The SCOAN and

0:55:20.700,0:55:31.900
the man of God took him as his own son, not as a member of the church.

0:55:31.940,0:55:35.800
He took the responsibility of burying the mother

0:55:35.800,0:55:40.920
and also awarded the children with scholarships.

0:55:40.920,0:55:43.640
Is that not wonderful?

0:55:43.640,0:55:48.580
It is the doing of God; it is not a man's doing.

0:55:48.580,0:55:52.660
That is a great challenge to our lives.

0:55:52.660,0:55:59.100
If you want to do something for God, run fast and serve the living God.

0:55:59.100,0:56:00.060
Amen.

0:56:00.060,0:56:03.660
We will stand here and pray for T.B. Joshua

0:56:03.660,0:56:08.220
for God to open more ways for him,

0:56:08.220,0:56:15.700
equip him, protect him, and preserve his life for us.

0:56:15.760,0:56:16.740
Hallelujah!

0:56:16.740,0:56:19.000
Amen.

0:56:19.000,0:56:44.100
Prayer

0:56:44.140,0:56:49.300
After the funeral service, the people follow the coffin in procession

0:56:49.300,0:56:53.220
as the body is moved to its final resting place.

0:56:53.860,0:56:56.300
I know there is another

0:56:56.300,0:56:59.180
Fellowship in Heaven

0:56:59.180,0:57:01.860
I know there is another

0:57:46.480,0:57:52.440
Overcome with emotion, Asuquo, the eldest son, cries out hysterically

0:57:52.440,0:57:57.200
as his late mother is about to be laid to rest in her grave.

0:58:08.960,0:58:14.580
Here is the son who daily entered the room where his dead mother's corpse lay

0:58:14.580,0:58:20.500
to light a lamp in order to deter rats from consuming the body.

0:58:20.500,0:58:25.560
Mr Etim looks on with a solemn expression on his face

0:58:25.560,0:58:31.660
as his wife's dead body is finally laid to rest.

0:58:47.940,0:58:59.340
The coffin is lowered at long last into the grave.

0:58:59.340,0:59:37.900
A funeral song

0:59:37.940,0:59:41.320
As they begin to cover the coffin with soil,

0:59:41.320,0:59:49.000
the family, friends and well wishers bid their final farewell to Mrs Aret.

1:00:34.120,1:00:39.180
With the burial of their mother over and having successfully reconciled

1:00:39.180,1:00:41.780
with the two communities to which they belong,

1:00:41.780,1:00:49.900
they embark on a long journey back to Lagos state and The SCOAN.

1:00:49.980,1:00:52.460
Accompanied by the Emmanuel TV team,

1:00:52.460,1:00:55.760
the family once again have boarded the bus.

1:00:55.760,1:01:07.200
This time, however, they are followed by Mr Etim.

1:01:07.240,1:01:12.460
It is night time when the buses finally pull into The SCOAN's driveway.

1:01:31.800,1:01:34.820
All the children take their seats.

1:01:34.820,1:01:38.860
Among the group is also the pastor who conducted their mother's funeral,

1:01:38.860,1:01:44.920
an elder from their village and members of The SCOAN from Akwo Ibom state.

1:01:44.920,1:01:48.000
Here we can see them climbing down from the bus

1:01:48.000,1:01:49.860
after a wearing journey.

1:01:49.860,1:01:54.840
Closely followed in the next bus by Mr Etim, their father.

1:01:54.840,1:01:58.720
He has been accused of wizardry, having been labelled as the one

1:01:58.720,1:02:02.280
who initiated his two youngest children,

1:02:02.280,1:02:06.740
which was said to have caused his wife's death.

1:02:07.220,1:02:09.320
Emmanuel! God is with us!

1:02:09.320,1:02:15.660
We thank the Lord Almighty for a successful journey to and from Akwa Ibom state,

1:02:15.660,1:02:21.580
which is the state of this family - the late woman's family that has been accused

1:02:21.580,1:02:26.300
of witches and wizards before they were vindicated on Sunday

1:02:26.300,1:02:28.900
when they came to The SCOAN.

1:02:28.900,1:02:33.060
After the service, they saw the man of God in his office

1:02:33.060,1:02:35.800
and he sent delegates of the Emmanuel TV team and others to follow them

1:02:35.800,1:02:38.740
to the village for the funeral of their late mother.

1:02:38.740,1:02:41.400
Now they are back here to The SCOAN.

1:02:41.400,1:02:47.000
We want to hear from our brother here, Mr Asuquo, who is the head of the family.

1:02:47.020,1:02:50.460
Can you come forward and let us hear from you.

1:02:50.460,1:02:51.640
You are welcome, in Jesus' name.

1:02:51.640,1:02:52.440
Amen.

1:02:52.440,1:02:56.580
Can you tell us your name and where you just arrived from?

1:02:56.580,1:02:58.920
My name is Mr Asuquo Etim Okon.

1:02:58.920,1:03:01.080
We are back from Akwa Ibom.

1:03:01.080,1:03:02.960
You just arrived from Akwa Ibom state?

1:03:02.960,1:03:03.460
Yes.

1:03:03.460,1:03:07.620
Abiaje-Idibe in Orue Ottong / Oruko L.G.A. in Oron, Akwa Ibom state.

1:03:07.620,1:03:10.680
This is my father, Mr Etim Okon Edem.

1:03:10.680,1:03:17.540
This is my brother, Emmanuel Etim Okon. He is the one that used to

1:03:17.540,1:03:20.420
light a lantern over my mother's corpse.

1:03:20.420,1:03:23.860
This is my second brother, Emem Etim Okon.

1:03:23.860,1:03:27.600
This one is Lucy Etim Okon Edem.

1:03:27.600,1:03:33.040
This is my brother who was also accused of being a wizard.

1:03:33.040,1:03:35.360
His name is Etim Etim Okon.

1:03:35.360,1:03:38.040
This one is my mother's sister's son.

1:03:38.040,1:03:42.080
This is my mother's sister, Mrs Patience Edet.

1:03:42.080,1:03:45.420
This is one of the elders in our village.

1:03:45.420,1:03:47.580
This is the pastor that buried my mother.

1:03:47.580,1:03:55.340
These are the delegates from The SCOAN that followed us

1:03:55.340,1:03:56.900
to bury my mother.

1:03:56.900,1:03:58.680
How were you received in the village?

1:03:58.680,1:04:01.800
When we got there, we didn't see our father.

1:04:01.800,1:04:06.740
We went to my uncle's house and we explained to him

1:04:06.740,1:04:14.760
and he took us to the Chief's place. We explained everything to the Chief.

1:04:14.760,1:04:19.860
Later, when my father came back, we explained everything to him

1:04:19.860,1:04:22.000
and they all agreed.

1:04:22.000,1:04:28.340
We went to my mother's family and paid everything

1:04:28.340,1:04:31.120
we needed to pay for my mother's burial.

1:04:31.120,1:04:35.520
The whole village was happy; it made history in our village.

1:04:35.520,1:04:39.720
When people saw the team that the man of God sent to bury my mother,

1:04:39.720,1:04:47.900
everybody was happy. They wanted to follow us down here to Lagos

1:04:47.900,1:04:50.040
to meet with the man of God.

1:04:50.040,1:04:52.940
You mean the villagers were very happy and excited

1:04:52.940,1:04:55.880
that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, sent delegates

1:04:55.880,1:04:59.240
to go and meet all members of your family, including your father,

1:04:59.240,1:05:02.840
and also organise the funeral of your mother. Every villager was very happy?

1:05:02.840,1:05:03.580
Yes, sir.

1:05:03.580,1:05:05.500
Let us briefly hear from your dad.

1:05:05.500,1:05:13.700
Sir, can you tell us your name, age and where you come from.

1:05:13.780,1:05:16.960
My name is Mr Etim Okon Edem.

1:05:16.960,1:05:18.520
How old are you, sir?

1:05:18.520,1:05:22.120
I am 50 years old.

1:05:22.120,1:05:24.080
Can you tell us where you come from, sir.

1:05:24.080,1:05:28.600
I am from Abiage-Idibe in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A.

1:05:28.600,1:05:31.660
in Oron, Akwa Ibom state.

1:05:31.660,1:05:40.800
Can our father tell us who the people are next to him.

1:05:40.880,1:05:46.440
They are my children.

1:05:46.440,1:05:51.500
I was so happy to see my children in the company of the delegates that

1:05:51.500,1:05:56.540
were sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua. I was so happy because there was no

1:05:56.540,1:06:01.060
hope for me to bury my dead wife, who was in the room where I live

1:06:01.060,1:06:05.020
the same compound. The Chief of the village was so happy.

1:06:05.020,1:06:08.160
The entire village was so happy, and they send their greetings

1:06:08.160,1:06:11.720
to the man of God.

1:06:11.720,1:06:18.940
The reason why my wife was not buried was that I had no money.

1:06:18.940,1:06:25.060
Even when I was looking for someone to buy my land in order to get money

1:06:25.060,1:06:30.020
for her burial, no one would buy the land.

1:06:30.020,1:06:33.960
We thank God Almighty that the late wife has been buried successfully

1:06:33.960,1:06:37.220
and they are here to give thanks to God for this successful burial

1:06:37.220,1:06:39.580
and successful journey from Akwa Ibom state.

1:06:39.580,1:06:42.020
We want to ask our father briefly: Is there any other reason

1:06:42.020,1:06:44.480
why he has come to The SCOAN?

1:06:44.480,1:07:10.660
The villagers accused me that I am a wizard and that I initiated

1:07:10.660,1:07:25.160
my children into the witchcraft world. I came here so that

1:07:25.160,1:07:41.700
the man of God will tell the world if I am a wizard or not.

1:07:41.760,1:07:47.500
The man said the villagers accused him of being a wizard.

1:07:47.500,1:07:52.020
They said the man initiated his own children into the witchcraft world.

1:07:52.020,1:07:59.720
As he has come, he wants the man of God to prove if he, Mr Etim, is a wizard or not.

1:07:59.720,1:08:01.080
We thank God for your life.

1:08:01.080,1:08:05.580
Can you tell us briefly what you have to say, your name, and what happened in the village.

1:08:05.580,1:08:08.620
My name is Emmanuel Etim Okon.

1:08:08.620,1:08:12.240
I come from Orue-Offong L.G.A. Aka Ibom.

1:08:12.240,1:08:14.660
The man sitting at that extreme, who is he to you?

1:08:14.660,1:08:16.380
He is my father.

1:08:16.380,1:08:18.340
Where you the one that used to light lantern

1:08:18.340,1:08:20.140
over the corpse of your mother before now?

1:08:20.140,1:08:21.340
Yes.

1:08:21.340,1:08:24.640
Before now, each time you see your mother's corpse inside the room

1:08:24.640,1:08:28.280
and you are lighting a lantern that rats would not eat the body of your mother,

1:08:28.280,1:08:30.160
how did you use to feel then?

1:08:30.160,1:08:34.680
I was not happy because there was no money to bury my mother.

1:08:34.680,1:08:37.520
Now that the man of God has sent delegates to bury your mother

1:08:37.520,1:08:40.180
and sponsored everything - buying the coffin and everything,

1:08:40.180,1:08:41.180
how do you feel?

1:08:41.180,1:08:42.980
I am very happy.

1:08:42.980,1:08:44.100
To God be the glory!

1:08:44.100,1:08:47.480
It is time now to hear from the very sister of the late woman.

1:08:47.480,1:08:51.160
Our sister, we welcome you to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.

1:08:51.160,1:08:52.300
Amen.

1:08:52.300,1:08:55.260
Can you tell us your name and where you come from.

1:08:55.260,1:08:57.520
My name is Patience Asoqor Ayam.

1:08:57.520,1:09:01.180
Thank you very much, Ma. Can you tell us who you are to this family and to the late woman.

1:09:01.180,1:09:03.400
The late woman is my sister.

1:09:03.400,1:09:07.080
The man sitting over there is her husband.

1:09:07.080,1:09:10.900
Can you tell us what you have to say, having realised that the man of God,

1:09:10.900,1:09:14.720
Prophet T.B. Joshua, had sent delegates to go to the village

1:09:14.720,1:09:16.980
and bury your late sister. How do you feel?

1:09:16.980,1:09:22.940
I feel very happy and I am here today to testify to what happened

1:09:22.940,1:09:31.600
in the village, and I thank T.B. Joshua for sending some delegates to

1:09:31.600,1:09:38.620
Akwa Ibom state to come and bury my sister. I am very glad and happy.

1:09:38.620,1:09:42.360
Can you tell us how long your late sister's corpse was kept in the room.

1:09:42.360,1:09:44.780
It was five to six months.

1:09:44.780,1:09:47.200
Why wasn't she buried? What happened?

1:09:47.200,1:09:50.700
Her husband had no money for the burial because in our tradition,

1:09:50.700,1:09:55.540
the husband must bury the wife and do all the traditional rights.

1:09:55.540,1:09:56.700
That was the reason.

1:09:56.700,1:09:57.920
This was the reason why you people decided

1:09:57.920,1:09:59.420
to keep the corpse in the room for six months?

1:09:59.420,1:10:00.160
Yes.

1:10:00.160,1:10:01.860
You are happy that the body is buried?

1:10:01.860,1:10:03.660
I am very happy.

1:10:03.660,1:10:06.260
To God be the glory! Thank you very much.

1:10:06.260,1:10:11.500
Can we hear from the pastor who presided over the burial.

1:10:11.520,1:10:18.500
My name is Pastor J.A. Akpan. I come from Akwa Ibom state.

1:10:18.500,1:10:25.020
The night before yesterday, Prophet T.B. Joshua sent the team

1:10:25.040,1:10:29.020
for the burial arrangements to be made.

1:10:29.020,1:10:37.800
They came to me that the man of God said that I should conduct the burial.

1:10:37.800,1:10:42.160
I said, "Wow, did he know this woman before?"

1:10:42.160,1:10:46.320
They said, "No". What a great love!

1:10:46.320,1:10:51.040
He has never been there before, but the man of God took upon himself

1:10:51.040,1:10:57.740
the whole responsibility of burying the sister. I was so glad and happy

1:10:57.740,1:11:04.280
and I called my elders and told them. They were happy to join me.

1:11:04.280,1:11:10.040
The whole district joined together, and we buried the sister successfully.

1:11:10.040,1:11:17.200
That is why I am here for the first time to come and greet the man of God

1:11:17.200,1:11:22.340
and also have a spiritual talk with him.

1:11:22.340,1:11:24.920
Glory be to God. Amen.

1:11:24.920,1:11:29.000
Can we hear from one of the villagers who actually witnessed the whole incident.

1:11:29.080,1:11:32.100
I am Joe Edem.

1:11:32.100,1:11:36.040
I am a native of Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko where

1:11:36.040,1:11:41.320
the woman died. The people here with me are from my village.

1:11:41.320,1:11:48.860
The man sitting there is Mr Etim Okon, the husband to the deceased.

1:11:48.860,1:11:57.140
The woman died about six months ago. Then, the husband was accused

1:11:57.140,1:12:01.120
that he was responsible for the death of his wife.

1:12:01.120,1:12:09.780
The whole village also accused the man that he initiated his children.

1:12:09.780,1:12:15.540
Because of this, the little money the man had all went because of

1:12:15.540,1:12:19.260
observing traditional rights. Anyone accused of being

1:12:19.260,1:12:23.860
a witch or wizard in our area, you will pay whatever you are told to pay,

1:12:23.860,1:12:26.240
otherwise, you will face the penalty.

1:12:26.240,1:12:31.160
After the man spent his money, he was financially handicapped.

1:12:31.160,1:12:35.880
There was no way he could bury his late wife.

1:12:35.880,1:12:41.000
All of a sudden, the children went out.

1:12:41.020,1:12:46.500
One fine day, I saw the young man coming with the team from

1:12:46.500,1:12:54.640
the man of God. They told me the men are from The SCOAN.

1:12:54.640,1:12:58.260
They did very well. All that we were supposed to do,

1:12:58.260,1:13:03.340
the church people helped us to do it. When I calculated

1:13:03.340,1:13:11.800
what the man of God did, I estimated it to be at least one million naira.

1:13:11.800,1:13:20.800
That is why I said I must come here to say thank you to the man of God

1:13:20.800,1:13:29.320
and to the whole church and to God Almighty for making

1:13:29.320,1:13:36.780
the burial of our wife a huge success. To God be the glory, in Jesus' name.

1:13:36.780,1:13:38.600
Amen.

1:13:38.620,1:13:43.440
After the man of God gave us 330,000 naira and six bags of rice,

1:13:43.440,1:13:48.000
he promised to send people to accompany us to the village

1:13:48.000,1:13:51.100
to bury my mother. I am so happy.

1:13:51.100,1:13:55.680
We bought a very nice casket to bury my mother. They filmed my mother.

1:13:55.680,1:13:58.260
People were very happy. I was very happy.

1:13:58.260,1:14:03.120
This thanksgiving will not finish this year. I will still continue to thank God

1:14:03.120,1:14:08.280
for what He has done in our lives because this is history in our village.

1:14:08.280,1:14:09.700
My mother has been buried.

1:14:09.700,1:14:12.560
People thought that my mother will not have a grave.

1:14:12.560,1:14:18.040
Today, my mother has a grave. I thank God for what Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:14:18.040,1:14:22.840
has done in my family. I praise God. Thank You, Jesus.

1:14:31.700,1:14:34.900
We want to listen to the family. Let them come out

1:14:34.900,1:14:37.600
and let us hear a word from them.

1:14:37.660,1:14:40.920
This is the Etim family from Akwa Ibom, Nigeria

1:14:40.920,1:14:47.560
returning to The SCOAN one week after Prophet T.B. Joshua has sent his team

1:14:47.560,1:14:50.560
to perform the burial rights for their mother.

1:14:50.560,1:14:54.420
The woman who because of false accusations of witchcraft

1:14:54.420,1:14:58.480
had remained unburied for the past six months.

1:14:58.480,1:15:02.300
Let us listen as they give thanks to God.

1:15:02.360,1:15:03.960
Emmanuel!

1:15:05.040,1:15:07.700
My name is Asuquo Etim Okon.

1:15:07.700,1:15:14.620
I am from Akwa Ibom - Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A.

1:15:14.620,1:15:17.300
I'm 23 years old.

1:15:17.320,1:15:20.920
Here is our father, the one that gave birth to us.

1:15:20.920,1:15:23.840
His name is Mr Etim Okon Edem.

1:15:23.840,1:15:26.880
That's my brother, Emmanuel Etim Okon -

1:15:26.880,1:15:30.680
the one that used to light a lantern in my mother's room.

1:15:30.680,1:15:34.500
This very one is my brother, Amen Etim Okon.

1:15:34.500,1:15:39.160
This one is our first daughter, Lucy Etim Okon.

1:15:39.160,1:15:42.780
These ones are the children they accused of being witches and wizards.

1:15:42.780,1:15:46.420
This one is Lucy Okon Etim, my senior brother's daughter.

1:15:46.420,1:15:50.020
This is our last born, Etim Okon Edem.

1:15:50.020,1:15:54.760
This one is my mother's sister's son.

1:15:54.760,1:15:58.220
You can see my mother's sister here.

1:15:58.220,1:16:06.040
And one man from our village has come to testify of what Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:16:06.040,1:16:14.320
has done in our village, and our pastor that gave a befittig burial to my mum.

1:16:14.320,1:16:19.280
My fathers and my sisters in the Lord, they are from Akwa Ibom.

1:16:19.280,1:16:25.640
They were sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to escort us to Akwa Ibom state.

1:16:25.640,1:16:31.000
I want to thank God for what the man of God has done in our lives.

1:16:31.000,1:16:36.700
I was here two weeks ago because of these little ones.

1:16:36.700,1:16:40.380
They were accused in the village for being witches and wizards.

1:16:40.380,1:16:47.240
When I was here in the prayer line, I saw it as an opportunity to talk with

1:16:47.240,1:16:51.140
the man of God. I then shouted, "Man of God, help me. Help these children.

1:16:51.140,1:16:53.700
They accused them of being witches. They say that they are the ones

1:16:53.700,1:16:55.980
that killed my mother".

1:16:55.980,1:17:04.600
The man of God then said that these children are not witches.

1:17:04.600,1:17:09.600
I am happy to hear what the man of God has said.

1:17:09.600,1:17:13.080
The man of God promised to join our family.

1:17:13.080,1:17:20.140
The Sunday we were here, I told the man of God that due to this problem,

1:17:20.140,1:17:23.500
my mother's dead body is on the ground and she is not buried.

1:17:23.500,1:17:27.320
I told the man of God that there was no money to take her to the mortuary,

1:17:27.320,1:17:29.360
They embalmed her and kept her in the house.

1:17:29.360,1:17:33.380
This is my brother that used to light a lantern in the house

1:17:33.380,1:17:35.400
where my mother's dead body was kept.

1:17:35.400,1:17:39.520
When I explained everything to the man of God, the man of God then

1:17:39.520,1:17:45.480
gave us the sum of 330,000 naira and six bags of rice.

1:17:45.480,1:17:51.100
Later, the man of God promised to give these children scholarships

1:17:51.100,1:18:00.220
and he sent a team and evangelists to go with us to Akwa Ibom to bury my mum.

1:18:00.220,1:18:03.120
So, I want to stand here and thank the man of God

1:18:03.120,1:18:06.000
for what he has done in our village.

1:18:06.000,1:18:08.840
The rumours were carried everywhere about what

1:18:08.840,1:18:16.300
Prophet T.B. Joshua has done in our family.

1:18:16.300,1:18:19.380
Now, my mother is buried.

1:18:19.380,1:18:22.660
People thought that my mother would not have a grave.

1:18:22.660,1:18:27.820
Today, with the help of T.B. Joshua, my mother has a grave.

1:18:27.820,1:18:31.900
I thank God for that.

1:18:31.980,1:18:34.960
This is the money that I'm talking about.

1:18:34.960,1:18:37.280
I never spent any of this money.

1:18:37.280,1:18:43.140
When we were about to go to the burial, he also gave us extra 20 bags of rice.

1:18:49.660,1:18:54.340
People have been calling me. Even when I was inside the vehicle,

1:18:54.340,1:18:59.400
I received many calls. They said that there is no burial in our village that

1:18:59.400,1:19:08.800
would look like my mother's burial.

1:19:08.800,1:19:13.380
I thank the man of God for what he has done in our family.

1:19:13.380,1:19:17.540
Right now, we are going to listen to their father, Mr Etim Okon.

1:19:17.540,1:19:21.020
He is going to speak in their local dialect which will be translated

1:19:21.020,1:19:23.380
for us into English. Let us listen to him.

1:19:30.180,1:19:33.600
My name is Etim Okon Edem.

1:19:43.500,1:19:49.520
I am from Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A., Akwa Ibom state.

1:20:27.860,1:20:35.660
I was accused of being a wizard. Then, the villagers stoned and tortured me

1:20:35.660,1:20:38.620
and abandoned the corpse of my wife, saying that I should be taking

1:20:38.620,1:20:40.440
care of her until they bury her.

1:20:40.440,1:20:43.720
There was no hope of burying my wife.

1:20:43.720,1:20:53.160
The Lord took my children to The SCOAN,

1:20:53.160,1:20:59.280
where they met the man of God called Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:20:59.280,1:21:04.120
The children explained the situation to him and what they were facing.

1:21:04.120,1:21:07.280
The man of God helped them.

1:21:07.280,1:21:11.780
In the village, I saw people I did not know before,

1:21:11.780,1:21:15.040
coming to me with my children.

1:21:15.040,1:21:21.980
They explained, "Man, rejoice, we want to bury your wife for you".

1:21:21.980,1:21:29.980
Really, I was still doubting. Then all of a sudden I said, "I agree with you people".

1:21:29.980,1:21:34.540
And they helped me. They did everything successfully.

1:21:34.540,1:21:36.720
That is why I am here.

1:21:36.720,1:21:42.620
I am also here so that the man of God will look at me and see

1:21:42.620,1:21:46.920
if I am a wizard. Thank You, Jesus.

1:22:14.540,1:22:22.520
I suffered for about 11 years because of my wife's issues. Finally she died.

1:22:22.520,1:22:28.260
And the Lord proved Himself beyond human expectations.

1:22:28.260,1:22:33.080
As I'm here, as I said earlier, I want the man of God

1:22:33.080,1:22:41.780
to look at me very well to confirm if the accusation is true or not.

1:22:41.780,1:22:43.000
That is what the man said.

1:22:43.800,1:22:46.800
Praise the Lord!

1:22:46.880,1:22:49.700
My name is Mrs Patience Asuquo Edet.

1:22:49.700,1:22:53.000
I am from Akwa Ibom state.

1:22:53.000,1:22:57.560
These are my sister's children, and this is my sister's husband.

1:22:57.560,1:22:59.760
This is the villagers' representative

1:22:59.760,1:23:04.300
and these are delegates from Lagos that Prophet T.B. Joshua sent to us.

1:23:04.300,1:23:10.820
Today, I am very happy for what God has done for me.

1:23:10.820,1:23:14.160
God has made impossibilities possible to us.

1:23:14.160,1:23:22.560
In our tradition, when a lady marries into a family,

1:23:22.560,1:23:29.120
when she dies, the husband takes responsibility for her burial.

1:23:29.120,1:23:34.100
My sister's husband doesn't even have 10 kobo to do that

1:23:34.100,1:23:36.860
because of the traditional rites surrounding the case.

1:23:36.860,1:23:43.840
But God Almighty led our son to Lagos to Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:23:43.840,1:23:48.420
Prophet T.B. Joshua became part of our family.

1:23:48.420,1:23:53.400
He helped us by giving my sister a befitting burial.

1:23:53.400,1:23:56.920
I really thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:23:56.920,1:24:01.060
and I ask God to reward him abundantly

1:24:01.060,1:24:07.620
and the delegates he sent from Lagos to join us for my sister's burial.

1:24:07.620,1:24:09.620
Now, I am very happy.

1:24:09.620,1:24:21.200
I say Prophet T.B. Joshua, remain blessed in Jesus' name.

1:24:21.220,1:24:25.600
Praise the Lord.

1:24:25.680,1:24:30.680
I am the pastor officiating the burial of our late sister.

1:24:30.680,1:24:41.400
My name is Pastor G.E. Akpan, of the Apostolic Church.

1:24:41.480,1:24:46.200
I was transferred newly to that place.

1:24:46.200,1:24:53.340
I didn't even believe that God is still using people to bless many people.

1:24:53.340,1:24:58.380
Now, I see and know that what the Scriptures have said already

1:24:58.380,1:25:06.000
is fulfilled in the family of Mr Etim.

1:25:06.040,1:25:10.840
I did not konw that such a sister had died,

1:25:10.840,1:25:20.100
until I saw a team of evangelists from The SCOAN

1:25:20.100,1:25:29.300
sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to pay all the rites

1:25:29.300,1:25:36.760
for the family of the deceased and for the married family too.

1:25:36.760,1:25:43.300
Later on, they came to me in the church, that such a thing had happened.

1:25:43.300,1:25:48.720
Since they mentioned the name of this prophet, I had no option

1:25:48.720,1:25:57.200
than to rise up and tell the Elders that we have a burial tomorrow morning

1:25:57.200,1:25:59.860
and none of them argued.

1:25:59.860,1:26:05.120
They told me everything, that such a sister had died. There was no hope

1:26:05.120,1:26:09.320
of burying her and now God has brought hope.

1:26:09.320,1:26:15.040
We joined hands together and gave her a befitting burial.

1:26:15.040,1:26:22.780
That is why I am here myself, to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:26:22.780,1:26:28.200
for what he has done for the family of Mr Etim Okon

1:26:28.200,1:26:32.020
and the entire village of Abiaje-Idibe.

1:26:32.020,1:26:35.200
May God bless him; may God keep him.

1:26:35.200,1:26:40.960
May God extend his life for this nation and the entire world at large.

1:26:40.960,1:26:46.800
Amen.

1:26:46.800,1:26:49.220
My name is Mr Joe Edem.

1:26:49.220,1:26:55.800
I am from Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A., Akwa Ibom state.

1:26:55.800,1:26:58.620
I am from the same village as Mr Etim Okon.

1:26:58.620,1:27:03.580
I knew right from the beginning the problem Mr Etim was facing

1:27:03.580,1:27:08.060
because of the sickness and death of his wife.

1:27:08.060,1:27:11.400
The whole thing started as narrated.

1:27:11.400,1:27:17.380
In our tradition, when you are accused of witchcraft,

1:27:17.380,1:27:22.180
there is a certain thing you must do before entering the midst of people.

1:27:22.180,1:27:25.940
Failing to do that, you will be punished.

1:27:25.940,1:27:29.080
The whole thing bounced back on Mr Etim.

1:27:29.080,1:27:34.700
Mr Etim was accused of being a wizard, that he initiated his two children

1:27:34.700,1:27:36.860
and that he killed his wife.

1:27:36.860,1:27:42.440
And he was asked to take the responsibility as traditions demand.

1:27:42.440,1:27:47.740
Then, Mr Etim was tortured by the villagers.

1:27:47.740,1:27:52.380
Finally, they abandoned the corpse of his wife with him

1:27:52.380,1:27:55.400
to take care, while he was penniless.

1:27:55.400,1:28:00.320
The children ran away from the village. We did not know where they went.

1:28:00.320,1:28:03.660
The last time I saw them they were sleeping here and there

1:28:03.660,1:28:07.880
because nobody allowed them to enter their house in the village.

1:28:07.880,1:28:11.960
Then one day I heard the news

1:28:11.960,1:28:17.320
that the son has come with a team of men of God to bury their mother.

1:28:17.320,1:28:20.400
I went there as a villager and I witnessed everything.

1:28:20.400,1:28:25.860
I said I would come here to testify to the glory of God

1:28:25.860,1:28:30.360
what the Lord has one in my village and in the family of Mr Etim Okon.

1:28:30.360,1:28:32.400
That is why I am here.

1:28:32.400,1:28:35.480
A huge amount of money was spent on the burial.

1:28:35.480,1:28:43.020
If I am to estimate, it would be about 1 million naira.

1:28:43.020,1:28:46.900
To God be the glory in Jesus' name.

1:28:46.900,1:28:50.400
Emmanuel!

1:28:50.460,1:28:52.640
You have listened.

1:28:52.640,1:28:56.700
I know that when they mentioned 1 million naira, you were making noise.

1:28:56.700,1:28:59.000
Can 1 million buy peace?

1:28:59.760,1:29:01.600
Joy?

1:29:01.600,1:29:05.300
There's no amount of money that can buy joy.

1:29:05.340,1:29:09.300
That joy that is restored in the family.

1:29:09.380,1:29:15.700
He just mentioned 1 million. It is a small thing.

1:29:15.740,1:29:19.460
We thank God that we got to the root.

1:29:19.460,1:29:24.420
When you look at what you wil spend, you will not be able to pursue that joy.

1:29:24.420,1:29:26.680
Look at the little children.

1:29:26.680,1:29:31.960
For them to start facing this kind of trouble at this age.

1:29:31.960,1:29:33.360
Sleeping on the street.

1:29:33.360,1:29:36.240
Look at the father, the husband of the woman.

1:29:36.240,1:29:42.900
I'm just looking at him now; he's not a wizard.

1:29:42.900,1:29:48.720
He just needs to accept Jesus as his Lord and Saviour.

1:29:48.720,1:29:53.360
He's not a wizard. He's not responsible for the death.

1:29:53.360,1:29:59.720
Can you imagine. That frustration and depression is enough to kill this man

1:29:59.720,1:30:04.460
Look at him. He looks like a school boy - it's poverty, suffering.

1:30:04.460,1:30:07.440
You cannot believe that he is a father.

1:30:07.440,1:30:13.660
Look at his body. It is trouble that made him as if he wants to disappear.

1:30:13.660,1:30:23.900
Now, this trouble is removed. Give him two months and see how the body will look then.

1:30:23.940,1:30:27.540
This is to tell you what the Lord has done for them.

1:30:27.540,1:30:32.140
God has brought joy and peace to the home.

1:30:32.140,1:30:38.500
How are you, sir?

1:30:38.520,1:30:40.720
I am fine. Thank you.

1:30:53.580,1:30:57.380
I am Mr Etim Okon.

1:30:57.380,1:31:01.740
I am happy that the man of God said that I am not a wizard and that

1:31:01.740,1:31:05.820
my children are not wizards. To God be the glory in Jesus' name!

1:31:05.820,1:31:11.060
He should learn to forgive and forget the past.

1:31:11.060,1:31:16.760
Whoever accused him of being a wizard, he should forgive and forget.

1:31:16.760,1:31:22.080
Because God has forgiven him, he should also forgive everyone

1:31:22.080,1:31:26.900
and see everyone as one. He should not look back.

1:31:26.900,1:31:30.340
The pain in the past is past.

1:31:30.340,1:31:33.680
The Lord is bringing joy - wonderful joy to the home.

1:31:33.680,1:31:37.520
He should not ever begin to think or look back at those

1:31:37.520,1:31:39.400
who called him a wizard.

1:31:39.400,1:31:46.420
Having them in mind or beginning to retaliate, the punishment will be great.

1:32:11.920,1:32:13.480
Amen.

1:32:25.780,1:32:30.960
From today, I have forgiven those that accused me of being a wizard.

1:32:30.960,1:32:34.940
As God has forgiven me, I have forgiven them.

1:32:34.940,1:32:40.300
I will not think anything bad against them again.

1:32:40.360,1:32:45.200
Like I have said right from the beginning of the meeting,

1:32:45.200,1:32:49.880
our outward quality, our attitude, our behaviours -

1:32:49.880,1:32:54.400
sometimes people look at it and say, "Ah, he is a wizard. He is the cause".

1:32:54.460,1:33:00.200
I need to counsel him. He needs deliverance.

1:33:00.280,1:33:04.680
But that does not mean that he is a wizard. He is not a wizard.

1:33:04.680,1:33:10.100
He has some bad attitude towards people.

1:33:10.100,1:33:14.760
People now look at it as if he is a wizard. He is not.

1:33:14.760,1:33:17.120
Everybody has his weakness.

1:33:17.120,1:33:21.380
He has that weakness. But it does not mean he is a wizard.

1:33:21.380,1:33:28.540
And the children. Most especially the brother that used to put a lamp every night.

1:33:28.540,1:33:30.540
He is the only person that was doing this?

1:33:30.540,1:33:31.040
Yes.

1:33:31.040,1:33:32.660
You need to be delivered.

1:33:32.660,1:33:33.320
Yes.

1:33:46.160,1:33:52.600
Because I'm seeing the spirit of death.

1:33:52.600,1:33:57.340
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

1:34:01.960,1:34:07.200
Out! In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

1:34:07.260,1:34:10.300
Can you see the manifestation? Can you see him?

1:34:10.300,1:34:12.780
Can you see - this is coming out of him.

1:34:12.780,1:34:15.920
Can you see?

1:34:15.920,1:34:19.320
He's changing body. He's transforming.

1:34:19.320,1:34:20.320
Look at the body.

1:34:20.320,1:34:21.900
Watch your screen.

1:34:21.900,1:34:23.080
He's transforming.

1:34:23.080,1:34:24.620
You can see the movement.

1:34:24.620,1:34:25.820
Do you see?

1:34:25.820,1:34:28.280
He's transforming from one form to another.

1:34:28.280,1:34:34.520
His normal self. Because the spirit of death is over him.

1:34:34.520,1:34:39.840
He began to eat with the dead; death is around him.

1:34:39.840,1:34:43.000
If he is not delivered, they just want him to get out of the church

1:34:43.000,1:34:46.040
and when he goes out there, he will just find himself in the midst of death.

1:34:46.040,1:34:48.420
He has the spirit of death.

1:34:48.420,1:34:50.320
That is just the repercussion.

1:34:50.320,1:34:54.860
Because it was his mum, does not mean the death does not know the children.

1:34:54.860,1:34:57.980
Once they die, they die. There is nothing like relation.

1:34:57.980,1:34:59.660
Out!

1:35:02.500,1:35:04.600
Can you see?

1:35:04.600,1:35:05.900
Watch your screen.

1:35:05.900,1:35:08.500
He is getting off.

1:35:18.540,1:35:21.000
It is gone.

1:35:21.040,1:35:24.280
He cannot stand straight; there is no body.

1:35:24.280,1:35:27.400
I just want you to know what I am talking about that

1:35:27.400,1:35:30.720
he is transforming from one form to another.

1:35:30.720,1:35:33.100
That is why I carried him up.

1:35:33.100,1:35:38.300
He is transforming. His real self - it is just standing here.

1:35:38.360,1:35:43.400
He spent almost five and a half months with the dead.

1:35:43.400,1:35:46.900
For five months, he alone was the one.

1:35:46.900,1:35:54.100
He would enter there, do everything. He has become part of them.

1:35:54.120,1:35:58.980
When he is finished, the whole thing will be off. He will become a normal person.

1:35:58.980,1:36:03.520
Unlike before, when he slept, he slept with them.

1:36:03.520,1:36:05.840
In the night, even during the day, when he stands like this,

1:36:05.840,1:36:08.480
he would see people walking on their heads.

1:36:08.480,1:36:11.560
This is exactly the repercussion.

1:36:11.560,1:36:15.300
But he did it because he is a small boy. He doesn't see anything wrong with it.

1:36:15.300,1:36:18.540
If they leave him to become bigger,

1:36:18.540,1:36:21.440
the next thing is that he would turn to a witchdoctor.

1:36:21.440,1:36:24.060
And he would be seeing things.

1:36:24.060,1:36:28.540
He can begin to consult them because he has a good relationship with them.

1:36:41.380,1:36:45.200
Out, in the name of Jesus!

1:36:45.280,1:36:48.400
Out!

1:36:48.420,1:36:51.800
Out!

1:36:51.820,1:36:53.220
Out!

1:37:20.260,1:37:29.200
This man is not a wizard. But this one possessed dead spirits.

1:37:29.280,1:37:34.760
He's not a wizard. He's just naturally stubborn. He just needs to accept God.

1:37:34.760,1:37:36.880
So, the brother is free.

1:37:43.160,1:37:51.100
We have come together to support these children, let them go back to school

1:37:51.100,1:37:55.500
and whatever we can do to give to their father.

1:37:55.500,1:38:00.500
We thank God for what the Lord has achieved.

1:38:00.500,1:38:04.400
There was 300,000 naira given to the family.

1:38:04.460,1:38:07.100
Come, boy.

1:38:07.100,1:38:10.880
Because they had to go back to the village,

1:38:10.880,1:38:19.000
330,000 naira was given to the brother to pay the debt. Apart from the funeral

1:38:19.000,1:38:24.500
they have done, give them 200,000 naira making 530,000 naira

1:38:24.500,1:38:28.560
so that the children will go back to school and they should take care

1:38:28.560,1:38:32.080
of the family. The father should have a better place to stay.

1:39:04.780,1:39:08.860
I am happy for what the man of God has done for me.

1:39:08.860,1:39:18.700
I give God the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

1:39:18.760,1:39:20.600
The children should go to school.

1:39:20.600,1:39:25.100
There is a purpose for this thing to happen today.

1:39:25.100,1:39:26.380
The occasion that happened today.

1:39:26.380,1:39:31.140
It means there is a hero, God's general, among these children.

1:39:31.140,1:39:33.120
God just wants this record.

1:39:33.120,1:39:37.700
This is history. You have to be part of the history.

1:39:37.720,1:39:40.800
So, thank you.

1:39:40.840,1:39:43.200
Hallelujah.

1:39:43.240,1:39:48.000
Because it is time to celebrate.

1:39:48.080,1:39:53.640
Celebrate Jesus celebrate

1:39:53.640,1:39:55.940

1:41:25.820,1:41:33.800

1:41:33.800,1:41:40.520
Come on and celebrate

1:41:40.520,1:41:47.900
The resurrection of the Lord

1:41:47.900,1:41:50.200
Amen.

1:41:50.200,1:41:54.200
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:41:54.260,1:41:57.700
TESTIMONY TIME

1:41:57.760,1:42:01.860
The father is going to speak in one of the Nigerian languages

1:42:01.860,1:42:05.400
and we have someone here who is going to translate

1:42:05.400,1:42:07.940
into English for us to understand.

1:42:07.940,1:42:11.720
So, we want him to start his testimony by telling us his name

1:42:11.720,1:42:16.080
and what God Almighty has done in his life today.

1:42:59.720,1:43:02.800
The man said he is Mr Etim Okon.

1:43:02.800,1:43:10.600
He is from a village called Abiaje-Idibe in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A., Akwa Ibom state.

1:43:10.640,1:43:19.580
There was something that happened to him. His wife fell sick and she died.

1:43:19.580,1:43:23.800
Then, the family scattered because he was accused of being a wizard.

1:43:23.800,1:43:29.580
They said that he initiated his children into the witchcraft world.

1:43:29.580,1:43:38.780
Because of this, he 'saw hell' - a lot of torture and he spent all that he had.

1:43:38.780,1:43:45.680
So, there was nothing left with him to do the burial as demanded.

1:43:45.680,1:43:48.800
All of a sudden, the children left him.

1:43:48.800,1:43:54.340
One day when he was in his house, he saw his children coming with a team

1:43:54.340,1:44:03.300
sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to his village.

1:44:03.360,1:44:13.000
They explained that they had come to give his late wife a befitting burial.

1:44:13.000,1:44:16.460
He jumped up and down and was so happy.

1:44:16.460,1:44:23.400
The burial was conducted. After that, he decided to come to

1:44:23.400,1:44:28.940
The SCOAN to see Prophet T.B. Joshua so he would

1:44:28.940,1:44:33.700
know if he was a wizard as alleged by the villagers.

1:44:33.700,1:44:35.820
That is why he is here.

1:44:48.840,1:44:52.700
This kind of thing has never happened in our area.

1:44:52.700,1:44:57.380
This is the first time of seeing someone who is not from his village, not even

1:44:57.380,1:45:03.320
from his state - giving such help to somebody.

1:45:25.480,1:45:29.420
I am very happy as the man of God looked at me and confirmed that

1:45:29.420,1:45:30.860
I am not a wizard.

1:45:30.860,1:45:35.520
I will go back joyfully to my village so thank God.

1:45:58.680,1:46:07.820
The man of God gave me 200,000 naira and a Holy Bible.

1:46:07.820,1:46:13.960
With this, I will continue to thank God for what God has done for me and

1:46:13.960,1:46:17.300
my family. To God be the glory.

1:46:17.340,1:46:19.740
I am Mr Joe Edem.

1:46:19.740,1:46:23.220
I am a native of Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko -

1:46:23.220,1:46:26.400
the same village as Mr Etim Okon.

1:46:26.440,1:46:32.820
For some years now, he has not been together with his children because

1:46:32.820,1:46:38.440
of the problem of the sickness of his wife.

1:46:38.440,1:46:45.120
After some time, his wife died and the problem continued.

1:46:45.120,1:46:51.680
Because of this problem of being accused of being a wizard and

1:46:51.680,1:46:59.200
initiating his children into the world of witchcraft, the man 'saw hell'.

1:46:59.200,1:47:06.400
I witnessed it because I am from that place.

1:47:06.440,1:47:10.020
When there was no hope, the Lord Jesus appeared

1:47:10.020,1:47:18.700
and exactly what the other people have said happened in the life of Mr Etim.

1:47:18.700,1:47:28.280
God used Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN to

1:47:28.280,1:47:33.340
intervene in the problem they had in their family.

1:47:33.340,1:47:39.880
Now, his son can see his father as a father and talk to him but before,

1:47:39.880,1:47:46.280
it wasn't like that. Now that God has joind them together, I am very happy.

1:47:46.280,1:47:52.900
To God be the glory. In Jesus' name. Amen.

1:47:52.980,1:47:59.940
Let us listen to the pastor who officiated the burial ceremony

1:47:59.940,1:48:02.900
of Mr Etim Okon's wife.

1:48:02.940,1:48:08.100
My name is Pastor J.A. Akpan.

1:48:08.180,1:48:19.800
I am a resident pastor in Orue-Offong / Oruko, Akwa Ibom state.

1:48:19.800,1:48:23.440
I am the person officiating this burial.

1:48:23.440,1:48:32.760
I have never been here before but something led me to The SCOAN

1:48:32.760,1:48:39.220
Having seen a team of evangelists coming to me,

1:48:39.220,1:48:48.680
saying that they were sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to pay for the burial of the

1:48:48.680,1:49:01.180
sister who died in my district, I was amazed and I asked if he knew

1:49:01.180,1:49:06.460
this woman before. They said, "No". I said, "How could this happen?"

1:49:06.460,1:49:08.860
They said, "It is the grace of God".

1:49:08.860,1:49:16.100
They paid all the rights. I called one of the elders there and asked.

1:49:16.100,1:49:21.760
He told me that since there was no hope of burying the sister quickly,

1:49:21.760,1:49:27.560
there was no need to tell me that such a thing had happened.

1:49:27.560,1:49:32.260
I thank God because God used the man of God to intervene

1:49:32.260,1:49:36.080
and do the burial. To God be the glory.

1:49:36.080,1:49:40.300
As Joshua said that as for him and his family, they will serve the Lord

1:49:40.300,1:49:43.880
we want to tell everyone of you, most especially your father,

1:49:43.880,1:49:47.980
that he should see to it he will train you all in the way of the Lord and

1:49:47.980,1:49:54.800
we pray that God Almighty will grant him the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.

1:49:54.840,1:50:00.080
It shall be permanent

1:50:00.080,1:50:02.760
What the Lord has done for us

1:50:02.760,1:50:04.900
It shall be permanent

1:50:04.900,1:50:06.300
Emmanuel!
