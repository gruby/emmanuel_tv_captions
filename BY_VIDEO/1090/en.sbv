"Come unto Me all ye that labour."

0:00:04.160,0:00:08.800
Here are Your children; they have come to You, Lord.

0:00:08.800,0:00:14.580
Every affliction in their blood, disease in their blood -

0:00:14.580,0:00:19.880
wherever it is located, I release them, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:19.880,0:00:23.860
You disease - out, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:23.860,0:00:36.320
Out, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:36.320,0:00:39.960
Command them out!

0:00:41.940,0:00:44.200
Wherever it is - in your faculties -

0:00:45.660,0:00:47.360
 

0:00:48.560,0:00:50.800
distance is not a barrier.

0:00:51.060,0:00:55.980
I say to that affliction, "Leave my people!"

0:00:55.980,0:00:59.820
I say to that disease, "Leave my people!"

0:00:59.820,0:01:03.760
I say to that sickness, "Leave my people!"

0:01:03.980,0:01:12.400
Leave my people!

0:01:12.400,0:01:15.040
In the name of Jesus!

0:01:16.960,0:01:22.280
Viewers all over the world, begin to walk out of disease.

0:01:22.280,0:01:27.540
I feel the touch of Jesus.

0:01:27.540,0:01:30.740
Walk out of disease!

0:01:31.920,0:01:33.780
I can see you being delivered.

0:01:33.780,0:01:36.000
I can see you being healed.

0:01:36.000,0:01:38.560
I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:38.560,0:01:41.280
 

0:01:44.000,0:01:49.600
Viewers all over the world, if it is true for your life that you are healed and delivered,

0:01:49.600,0:01:53.400
begin to confess your deliverance, confess your healing.

0:01:53.400,0:01:57.640
If it is true for you, you are healed!

0:02:04.280,0:02:09.740
If the Word of God is true for your life, say, "I am healed; I am delivered!"

0:02:09.960,0:02:12.440
Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:02:12.720,0:02:15.160
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:15.720,0:02:18.660
Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:02:18.660,0:02:21.120
Mean it!

0:02:22.120,0:02:22.760
