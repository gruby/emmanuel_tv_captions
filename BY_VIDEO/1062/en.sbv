0:00:00.020,0:00:03.880
Under the unction and instruction of the Holy Spirit,

0:00:03.880,0:00:09.860
Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers to people within The SCOAN auditorium.

0:00:09.860,0:00:17.480
Among them is this man who instantly reacts as the power of God flows through his body.

0:00:17.480,0:00:23.280
Every unclean spirit that operated in his life is now bowing and submitting

0:00:23.280,0:00:27.180
to the superior authority in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:27.180,0:00:29.180
Let's watch what happens next.

0:00:29.180,0:00:32.520
You are addicted to drugs.

0:00:32.520,0:00:35.060
Yes.

0:00:35.060,0:00:36.500
It's an addiction.

0:00:36.500,0:00:37.440
Yes.

0:00:37.440,0:00:41.760
You took the drugs and you carried the drugs.

0:00:41.760,0:00:48.460
This is an addiction. If care is not taken, you will live the rest of your life in prison.

0:00:48.460,0:00:51.920
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
And Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:51.920,0:00:55.260
He's free.

0:00:55.260,0:00:58.280
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:00:58.280,0:01:04.260
He is free indeed from the spirit of addiction. Glory be to God!

0:01:04.260,0:01:08.380
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:08.380,0:01:12.960
My name is Geronimo, and I come from a small country in Europe.

0:01:12.960,0:01:16.640
My testimony goes like this:

0:01:16.640,0:01:23.220
It happened when the man of God touched me and prophesied that I was into hard drugs

0:01:23.220,0:01:27.900
and it was one hundred percent true.

0:01:27.900,0:01:31.940
From that moment, the bad spirit left me

0:01:31.940,0:01:40.760
and the urge for drugs and to be back in the criminal life, went away.

0:01:40.760,0:01:49.540
It all started when I was the age of 15 or 16; I started selling marijuana.

0:01:49.540,0:01:55.740
At the age of 17 or 18, I started selling cocaine.

0:01:55.740,0:02:01.340
After that, I started selling guns and carrying guns myself.

0:02:01.340,0:02:06.620
That was when I became a part of organised crime.

0:02:06.620,0:02:13.840
I was especially trafficking cocaine in different parts of Europe.

0:02:13.840,0:02:19.060
So, our brother is explaining how from a very young age, he got involved in these criminal activities.

0:02:19.060,0:02:24.080
Apart from trafficking these drugs, you were also taking these drugs yourself.

0:02:24.080,0:02:29.120
Yes, I was also sometimes taking the drugs myself

0:02:29.120,0:02:39.800
and that led me to a lifestyle where all the money I got, only went for bad things.

0:02:39.800,0:02:43.500
So, you said, every money you received through this, you would use it for bad things.

0:02:43.500,0:02:47.680
Could you give us an example of how you were living your life at this period?

0:02:47.680,0:02:59.000
All the money was spent on prostitutes, parties, expensive cars, holidays, and not good things.

0:02:59.000,0:03:04.760
I paid to have tattoos made.

0:03:04.760,0:03:09.240
So, our brother is explaining that everything - the finances he made

0:03:09.240,0:03:14.700
from these illicit activities - he ended up using them for very bad things

0:03:14.700,0:03:18.580
such as visiting prostitutes, clubbing and other such things -

0:03:18.580,0:03:21.380
even tattooing various tattoos across his body.

0:03:21.380,0:03:26.740
So, as you were engaging in this - tell us, brother, more about your story,

0:03:26.740,0:03:31.360
how the spirit pushed you to these criminal activities.

0:03:31.360,0:03:35.460
Yes, it pushed me really hard.

0:03:35.460,0:03:40.560
I was especially focused on trafficking cocaine.

0:03:40.560,0:03:44.980
Mostly, I went to countries with a harbour; that is where we would get it.

0:03:44.980,0:03:51.340
We trafficked it with a strong magnet under cars on the motorblock.

0:03:51.340,0:03:57.840
If the police caught us, someone would hide it there.

0:03:57.840,0:04:06.220
It was mostly one-day trips back to my country - one day there, one night sleeping, one day back,

0:04:06.220,0:04:10.860
then distributing the drugs.

0:04:10.860,0:04:16.860
That lifestyle took me to Thailand to prison.

0:04:16.860,0:04:22.360
So, our brother is saying that it even got to the extent that he went to prison in Thailand.

0:04:22.360,0:04:28.800
How did you now come to a point where you realised you needed to stop such activities?

0:04:28.800,0:04:34.500
That was at the age of 25 or 26.

0:04:34.500,0:04:44.460
I began to realise that I could not go further with that because nothing good came from that life.

0:04:44.460,0:04:49.160
I started to slow down but still, there was something that pushed me every time.

0:04:49.160,0:04:55.700
When I wanted to slow down or quit everything, I couldn't help myself.

0:04:55.700,0:05:00.160
Finally, the only solution was Jesus Christ.

0:05:00.160,0:05:05.180
Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:05.180,0:05:10.100
So, our brother is explaining how he realised he needed to stop this lifestyle

0:05:10.100,0:05:15.100
but there was a force pushing him and he could not stop on his own.

0:05:15.100,0:05:20.440
So, brother, could you just tell us - at this point, you were taking these drugs as well -

0:05:20.440,0:05:24.440
as you were engaging in the trafficking, you were also taking the drugs.

0:05:24.440,0:05:28.040
How did that addiction to the drugs affect your own health and life?

0:05:28.040,0:05:36.360
It affected my health; I was not able to train which I did before.

0:05:36.360,0:05:42.120
I started taking some drugs daily.

0:05:42.120,0:05:45.740
You have said that it reached a point where you were taking some of these drugs on a daily basis.

0:05:45.740,0:05:49.900
Now, how did you discover this church in the midst of this?

0:05:49.900,0:05:54.220
How did you find out about The SCOAN?

0:05:54.220,0:05:59.780
When I started wanting to slow down, I started watching YouTube.

0:05:59.780,0:06:06.280
One day when I was watching YouTube, Emmanuel TV popped up on the first page.

0:06:06.280,0:06:11.060
There was a video about a drug trafficker from Libya.

0:06:11.060,0:06:20.560
It touched my heart and I became nearly addicted to watching Emmanuel TV.

0:06:20.560,0:06:25.480
So, you were not looking for that video? As you were on YouTube, the video just popped up

0:06:25.480,0:06:28.940
and you saw a video of a testimony of someone who was also a drug trafficker

0:06:28.940,0:06:32.720
who was delivered here in The SCOAN and that really touched you.

0:06:32.720,0:06:33.620
Yes.

0:06:33.620,0:06:35.400
Glory be to God Almighty.

0:06:35.400,0:06:40.440
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:40.440,0:06:44.240
And, brother, to the glory of God, you finally came to The SCOAN.

0:06:44.240,0:06:47.700
Just tell us what happened when you came.

0:06:47.700,0:06:53.800
After watching Emmanuel TV for three years, finally, I came here.

0:06:53.800,0:07:03.600
When I came to The SCOAN and wanted to take my drugs out, they had disappeared.

0:07:03.600,0:07:09.100
Brother, since you arrived in the church and received that word of prophecy and deliverance,

0:07:09.100,0:07:12.740
just tell us the changes in your life.

0:07:12.740,0:07:17.560
The urge and the push is finally gone.

0:07:17.560,0:07:23.740
Everything that pushed me before to do criminal things or take drugs is finally gone.

0:07:23.740,0:07:28.000
I have no urge for smoking or drinking.

0:07:28.000,0:07:34.860
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:07:34.860,0:07:36.860
Wow! We give all the glory to God Almighty.

0:07:36.860,0:07:40.340
Brother, we believe you are really in a position to advise people.

0:07:40.340,0:07:45.740
Especially those who are still taking drugs, are involved in such activities as trafficking drugs.

0:07:45.740,0:07:48.540
As you are here right now, what is your word of advice?

0:07:48.540,0:07:55.280
My word of advice: Nothing good comes out from drugs.

0:07:55.280,0:08:03.080
I can only advise never to go into that life because you will just lose everything you have.

0:08:03.080,0:08:07.100
There comes nothing good from it.

0:08:07.100,0:08:12.080
So, you are advising people that if they are into such a lifestyle or taking such things -

0:08:12.080,0:08:17.100
what should they do to receive solution and freedom?

0:08:17.100,0:08:27.340
The only way I got my problem solved was at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, through Jesus Christ!

0:08:27.340,0:08:30.880
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:30.880,0:08:36.020
I think what our brother is really emphasizing is that he had tried on his own to stop

0:08:36.020,0:08:40.120
but there was a force beyond his control that was really pushing him into that life,

0:08:40.120,0:08:42.520
once he got involved at such a young age.

0:08:42.520,0:08:47.100
But today, he is delivered through the prayer and prophecy of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:47.100,0:08:50.320
And he is advising people that if anyone is having a similar issue,

0:08:50.320,0:08:53.500
they need to seek deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ

0:08:53.500,0:08:58.080
to be separated from the evil spirit behind such an addiction or such activities.

0:08:58.080,0:09:00.580
Today, he is a living testimony to the glory of God.

0:09:00.580,0:09:04.380
Brother, we thank God for your life. We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance

0:09:04.380,0:09:07.120
by making the Word of God the standard for your life

0:09:07.120,0:09:10.680
and we believe the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:09:10.680,0:09:11.420
Amen.

0:09:11.420,0:09:17.960
One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:09:17.960,0:09:22.320
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:09:22.320,0:09:26.700
Hello. My name is Geronimo, and I come from a small country in Europe.

0:09:26.700,0:09:30.960
I came to The SCOAN two weeks ago.

0:09:30.960,0:09:36.260
The man of God touched me and for the first time, prophesied to me, on Sunday

0:09:36.260,0:09:45.900
and he was very right in his prophecy that I was into hard drugs and had a criminal past.

0:09:45.900,0:09:59.280
After that, he prayed for me and delivered me and I feel good.

0:09:59.280,0:10:11.400
From 15 to 29, I lived a criminal life, with ups and downs.

0:10:11.400,0:10:15.900
You can never get anything good out of a criminal life.

0:10:15.900,0:10:21.600
I was into drug trafficking an dmore.

0:10:21.600,0:10:27.000
I operated in different parts of Europe and was involved in organised crime.

0:10:27.000,0:10:32.080
I was sitting at home and one day, as I was watching YouTube,

0:10:32.080,0:10:38.760
Emmanuel TV popped up on the first page and I started to watch it.

0:10:38.760,0:10:43.060
Since that day, I have been watching it nearly every day.

0:10:43.060,0:10:50.080
After three years of watching Emmanuel TV, I finally arrived here.

0:10:50.080,0:10:53.980
Ok. So, since after your deliverance last Sunday, can you please share with us -

0:10:53.980,0:10:58.860
what are the changes and the transformation that has taken place in your life?

0:10:58.860,0:11:05.760
Everything has changed - no more pain, no more urge for bad things,

0:11:05.760,0:11:11.880
no urge for drugs, smoking, criminal things. Everything has gone.

0:11:11.880,0:11:25.160
Now, I can focus on God's will, the good side of life and forget about the past.

0:11:25.160,0:11:28.780
I am totally delivered, in Jesus' name.

0:11:28.780,0:11:30.560
We thank God Almighty for your life.

0:11:30.560,0:11:35.180
Now, we can see you making preparations - you are going back to your country, right?

0:11:35.180,0:11:36.000
Yes.

0:11:36.000,0:11:39.060
What message are you taking back to your country?

0:11:39.060,0:11:47.240
I can say to everyone - if you have the same problem I had which I came here with,

0:11:47.240,0:11:55.300
involve God who is really at work here. I have never been in a place like this before.

0:11:55.300,0:12:03.140
This was my first time and I can say that God is really at work here.

0:12:03.140,0:12:05.540
So now that you are going back to your country,

0:12:05.540,0:12:11.820
the man of God wants to make a meaningful contribution to your life,

0:12:11.820,0:12:15.160
apart from the deliverance you have received through the grace of God

0:12:15.160,0:12:18.380
in the life of the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:18.380,0:12:23.880
The man of God has also decided, with the support of the Emmanuel TV Partners,

0:12:23.880,0:12:29.660
to bless you with the cash sum of 2,000 USD.

0:12:29.660,0:12:34.200
This is the money, for you to be able to reestablish yourself

0:12:34.200,0:12:39.060
in going into a new business and forgetting about your past

0:12:39.060,0:12:42.880
and having no reason to go back to your past anymore

0:12:42.880,0:12:48.920
and 'The Mirror' book from the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:12:48.920,0:12:52.720
Thank you, Man of God, for everything you have done for me

0:12:52.720,0:12:58.720
and to the Emmanuel TV Team and Partners, thank you very much for everything.

0:12:58.720,0:13:06.780
For this 2,000 USD and 'The Mirror' book, I can go back to my country and start a new life

0:13:06.780,0:13:09.660
and make everything well.

0:13:09.660,0:13:11.500
I am very grateful for everything.

0:13:11.500,0:13:13.500
Thank You, Jesus!

0:13:13.500,0:13:17.100
Thank you very much. On behalf of the anointed man of God and the Emmanuel TV Partners,

0:13:17.100,0:13:22.520
thank you also for accepting this cash gift and we know this is also going to transform your life

0:13:22.520,0:13:26.640
and with this money, you will start a new business.

0:13:26.640,0:13:30.800
We believe that very soon, you are coming back here to give glory to God Almighty

0:13:30.800,0:13:34.560
for the great transformation that will begin to take place in your life

0:13:34.560,0:13:37.640
after this deliverance you have received, in Jesus' name.

0:13:37.640,0:13:39.140
Amen!

0:13:39.140,0:13:42.540
Thank You, Jesus!
