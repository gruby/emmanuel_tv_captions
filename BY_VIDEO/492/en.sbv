PROPHECY TIME

0:00:02.320,0:00:04.240
How are you?
Where is your wife?

0:00:04.240,0:00:06.940
She was in the church.
She went for a meeting right now.

0:00:06.940,0:00:08.640
That is your first wife.

0:00:08.640,0:00:10.040
It is my wife, my only wife.

0:00:10.040,0:00:11.180
I want to see you.

0:00:11.180,0:00:13.120
OK, sir.

0:00:13.120,0:00:15.960
Because there is a controversy.

0:00:15.960,0:00:22.500
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:22.500,0:00:32.400
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:32.400,0:00:35.320
Wow!

0:00:35.320,0:00:38.160
My name is Henry Nwajames.

0:00:38.160,0:00:42.200
The person beside me is my lovely wife.

0:00:42.200,0:00:48.960
As you saw from the telecast on that fateful day, the servant of Jesus Christ Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:48.960,0:00:52.220
was moving about.

0:00:52.220,0:01:00.280
As he was coming towards me, inside me I was praying that this servant of God will talk to me.

0:01:00.280,0:01:07.860
I was thinking about how he would speak about my breakthrough - my millions and my businesses -

0:01:07.860,0:01:11.000
not knowing that he would take me to a different direction.

0:01:11.000,0:01:15.640
When he eventually got to me, he asked if he could speak to me.

0:01:15.640,0:01:17.680
I told him that he could go ahead and speak to me.

0:01:17.680,0:01:20.500
He asked about my wife and my wife had just left for a meeting.

0:01:20.500,0:01:24.980
I told him that my wife had just left for a meeting. He said, "Your first wife".

0:01:24.980,0:01:26.940
I could not understand.

0:01:26.940,0:01:30.120
Before I knew it, he said, "There is a controversy".

0:01:30.120,0:01:36.560
As God would have it, before I could get to my house that fateful day, my wife had returned from the meeting,

0:01:36.560,0:01:39.040
my mother-in-law and brothers and sisters were all in the house.

0:01:39.040,0:01:41.760
They were watching Emmanuel TV.

0:01:41.760,0:01:43.920
As I left the church, I didn't understand anything.

0:01:43.920,0:01:48.400
My mind didn't even take me to where the Holy Spirit was taking me.

0:01:48.400,0:01:52.820
When I got home, the woman shouted, "Didn't you know what to tell the man of God?"

0:01:52.820,0:01:56.280
She asked if I had forgotten the story I told her about my daughter somewhere.

0:01:56.280,0:02:00.720
I said, "Oh, are you sure that is what the man of God is talking about?"

0:02:00.720,0:02:02.940
I said, "But I don't know how to go about it".

0:02:02.940,0:02:06.900
I had to contact my cousin who was the only person who knew about the issue.

0:02:06.900,0:02:10.800
It was in those early days when I was a child.

0:02:10.800,0:02:12.960
I did disco jockeying in those days.

0:02:12.960,0:02:20.780
On my father's side is very close to where I used to do disco jockeying.

0:02:20.780,0:02:24.580
That is the place I used to meet with this young lady who begot this girl.

0:02:24.580,0:02:31.340
So, when this matter happened - not that I didn't hear about it - my brother came and told me

0:02:31.340,0:02:32.580
that the girl was pregnant.

0:02:32.580,0:02:34.320
He asked me: "What do we do about it?"

0:02:34.320,0:02:36.920
He said: "Since that is the case, you have to rush away from here

0:02:36.920,0:02:39.720
because everybody knows that this place is your maternal home.

0:02:39.720,0:02:42.600
If this thing happens, I don't know what will happen next".

0:02:42.600,0:02:52.340
That is how I ran away from my father's place and maternal home.

0:02:52.340,0:02:57.280
I unwillingly gave her my cousin's telephone number.

0:02:57.280,0:03:02.420
When she called the young man, he said: "Right now, I don't know how to trace this girl

0:03:02.420,0:03:09.120
but give me some time; I will know what to do about it".

0:03:09.120,0:03:15.440
One day, my cousin called me that the aunty to my daughter was late and that it was an opportunity

0:03:15.440,0:03:16.420
for me to see her.

0:03:16.420,0:03:20.660
I told him that when he saw her, he should let me know.

0:03:20.660,0:03:26.580
The young man called us later on and told us that he had got her number and information about her.

0:03:26.580,0:03:33.380
Before I knew it, he called me and said that this lady's husband had just died.

0:03:33.380,0:03:37.560
He said that that was the information that he had just got now.

0:03:37.560,0:03:39.940
I said: "Wow", and then he said: "What should we do?"

0:03:39.940,0:03:41.840
I replied: "This is an opportunity for us to see her".

0:03:41.840,0:03:47.000
Before we knew it, one day he called me to say he had called the girl she was coming and that we should come.

0:03:47.000,0:03:52.960
I was unwillingly to go but my wife insisted that I should come.

0:03:52.960,0:03:58.900
She said: "Let me go and see. Do you want me to die in poverty?"

0:03:58.900,0:04:01.740
I said that I was sorry and that she should go and find out.

0:04:01.740,0:04:07.920
I was in my house and my wife called me back to say that people were crying and shouting,

0:04:07.920,0:04:09.740
saying: "Look, at what you have done".

0:04:09.740,0:04:16.280
I said that I was very sorry, that she should help me to tell her that I was sorry.

0:04:16.280,0:04:18.880
Regarding the controversy that the man of God was talking about,

0:04:18.880,0:04:25.420
the husband that died needed to be buried on the 27th of December.

0:04:25.420,0:04:34.340
I said that I would send my wife and family but when they got there, the burial was no longer conducted

0:04:34.340,0:04:39.220
which is the controversy that the man of God was talking about.

0:04:39.220,0:04:48.180
When they came back, I was told that a letter had come from the court, asking them to leave the house,

0:04:48.180,0:04:52.620
that the children and wife no longer belong to the husband.

0:04:52.620,0:04:54.760
I did not understand.

0:04:54.760,0:05:00.000
Hallelujah. We have been listening to the experience of Mr. Henry Nwajames, to his explaining that

0:05:00.000,0:05:07.280
the prophecy he received from Prophet T.B. Joshua concerning his first wife and a controversy is very true.

0:05:07.280,0:05:12.340
When he was young man, long time before he got married, he had a relationship with a lady.

0:05:12.340,0:05:14.080
He was very young at that time.

0:05:14.080,0:05:21.080
The lady became pregnant but because of the shame and everything attached to that he denied that baby

0:05:21.080,0:05:25.440
and the entire family also denied that baby.

0:05:25.440,0:05:29.540
He said that when the man of God mentioned this to him he didn't even think about it.

0:05:29.540,0:05:35.840
It was only a friend who reminded him that he had told him a story about how he had impregnated a lady

0:05:35.840,0:05:37.940
when he was very very small.

0:05:37.940,0:05:44.580
Since that time he could not trace the girl, he had never seen the girl, he had no fatherly relation with the girl.

0:05:44.580,0:05:47.080
In fact he didn't even know where the girl was.

0:05:47.080,0:05:51.920
After the man's of God prophecy, he asked the particular family member who knew about the case

0:05:51.920,0:05:58.540
to try and trace this particular girl and found out that she had married but her husband had just died

0:05:58.540,0:06:10.080
and there was a lot of controversy surrounding the death of her husband, and the burial was unable to hold.

0:06:10.080,0:06:17.080
People were even accusing this girl of being behind her husband's death.

0:06:17.080,0:06:22.840
This thing happened about 28 years ago and I've not seen this girl with my eyes

0:06:22.840,0:06:28.360
'til today when I invited my cousin to help me trace her.

0:06:28.360,0:06:32.280
We are in the church now and it is the first time I am meeting her.

0:06:32.280,0:06:36.780
This situation has actually held him in bondage for many years.

0:06:36.780,0:06:39.040
The business collapsed, everything collapsed.

0:06:39.040,0:06:41.280
He had been struggling to get it right - no way.

0:06:41.280,0:06:46.040
But he never thought there was something, somewhere.

0:06:46.040,0:06:47.840
Not, until this prophetic word.

0:06:47.840,0:06:52.820
The child is inside the church now - he has never seen this child.

0:06:52.820,0:06:54.680
Let the child come out.|

0:06:54.680,0:06:56.100
For how many years?

0:06:56.100,0:06:57.420
For 28 years.

0:06:57.420,0:06:58.760
... you saw her last?

0:06:58.760,0:07:00.800
I've not seen her before.

0:07:00.800,0:07:02.340
You don't even know her?

0:07:02.340,0:07:05.440
Yes, sir.

0:07:05.440,0:07:17.360
Mr Henry Nwajames' Daughter & Grandchildren

Can you stand up and tell God, "God, reveal my own"?

[God, reveal my own.]

0:07:55.900,0:07:57.360
Stand up!

0:07:59.440,0:08:05.560
Stand up.
Let God reveal your own.

0:08:05.560,0:08:07.280
The father and the daughter are there now.

0:08:07.280,0:08:11.360
They don't know whether to hug themselves or to greet themselves...

0:08:11.360,0:08:14.020
The lady started to cry.

0:08:14.020,0:08:20.860
Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
Prophecy Confirmation

0:08:20.860,0:08:22.160
Who is this man?

0:08:22.160,0:08:23.460
He is my cousin.

0:08:23.460,0:08:25.620
He is the one that knows our secret.

0:08:25.620,0:08:27.500
Thank you.

0:08:27.500,0:08:28.540
They are your children.

0:08:28.540,0:08:31.940
Yes, sir.

0:08:31.940,0:08:41.700
You have to forgive your dad because this is by revelation not by human hands.

0:08:41.700,0:08:42.900
It has been your prayer.

0:08:42.900,0:08:47.400
What have been your prayers before now?

0:08:47.400,0:08:51.900
All my life, I have been praying to see him.

0:08:51.900,0:08:56.240
All your life you have been praying to see him?

0:08:56.240,0:08:58.920
But your mommy gave you some pictures in the past.

0:08:58.920,0:09:00.420
She didn't tell anything.

0:09:00.420,0:09:01.980
Your mommy didn't tell you anything?

0:09:01.980,0:09:03.360
Yes, sir.

0:09:03.360,0:09:07.560
All my life, I have been staying with my grandmother.

0:09:07.560,0:09:13.900
That is, the person that I took as my mother but I didn't know she was my grandmother.

0:09:13.900,0:09:18.360
So, she died here in 1999.

0:09:18.360,0:09:25.820
That was when I came to Lagos to stay with her son and his wife.

0:09:25.820,0:09:31.640
The family did not register me for the SSCE exam.

0:09:31.640,0:09:40.700
One day, I was having an issue with them, so the wife called me a bastard.

0:09:40.700,0:09:45.340
The husband then said that I behave like my father.

0:09:45.340,0:09:54.960
So, I ran away from the house and went to meet my uncle because he lives closer to the house.

0:09:54.960,0:10:03.600
So, I told my uncle what the man had said, calling me a bastard and asked him if he knew anything about it

0:10:03.600,0:10:08.940
or if not, I would kill myself or I would run away from the house.

0:10:08.940,0:10:12.720
He told me that I had a father but it was a secret.

0:10:12.720,0:10:17.160
I asked him what kind of secret could he not tell me about in my situation.

0:10:17.160,0:10:24.920
He replied that it was a secret that nobody knew about except him, my mother and my father.

0:10:24.920,0:10:30.440
I said: "OK, if you cannot tell me anything about it, it is better for me to run away".

0:10:30.440,0:10:33.360
So, I run away from his house.

0:10:33.360,0:10:40.160
Unfortunately, the husband and wife found out where I was living.

0:10:40.160,0:10:47.260
After my SSCE exam, she has a restaurant in Lagos island,

0:10:47.260,0:10:54.580
and she said I should help her sell in her beer parlour, restaurant.

0:10:54.580,0:11:00.540
There was where I was staying with her and helping her to sell.

0:11:00.540,0:11:11.340
All through those days, I was crying and weeping because I was going through trials and temptation.

0:11:11.340,0:11:16.560
At any little thing that I did, she would repeat that I was a bastard.

0:11:16.560,0:11:24.940
Anywhere I was, I would be telling God: "I need to know where I come from".

0:11:24.940,0:11:29.020
She then introduced me to one man who is my husband now.

0:11:29.020,0:11:32.000
She said that I should go and marry him.

0:11:32.000,0:11:38.740
At that time, I was only 16 years old.

0:11:38.740,0:11:41.040
OK, it is all right.

0:11:41.040,0:11:42.520
What would you...?

0:11:42.520,0:11:45.260
You have... I don't know - this is your daughter.

0:11:45.260,0:11:46.200
Man of God, please...

0:11:46.200,0:11:49.420
Stand up.

0:11:49.420,0:11:53.500
I don't know.

0:11:53.500,0:11:55.440
I think I need to sit...

0:11:55.440,0:11:58.120
And these are your children?

0:11:58.120,0:11:59.480
Yes, sir.

0:11:59.480,0:12:04.180
This is my first born and this is the second born.

0:12:04.180,0:12:12.800
So, we thank God for this revelation.

0:12:12.800,0:12:18.320
The name of God is so wonderful.

0:12:18.320,0:12:21.400
This is a job for you.

0:12:21.400,0:12:30.260
Since God has shown so much mercy and kindness, ... I don't know.

0:12:30.260,0:12:33.320
So, help me to take them to the round table.

0:12:33.340,0:12:41.820
The father will do the right thing over there, not in an open space here, OK?

0:12:41.820,0:12:43.580
My daughter, please.

0:12:43.580,0:12:45.680
Thank you very much.

Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
Prophecy Confirmation

0:12:56.880,0:13:01.680
The reconciliation will not happen in the place where you or me will be.

0:13:01.680,0:13:12.440
TESTIMONY TIME

0:13:12.440,0:13:17.020
Mr. Nwajames with his family, daughter and grandchildren were taken to a quiet,

0:13:17.020,0:13:22.660
pleasant environment, where they could have some privacy and enjoy their first meal together.

0:13:22.660,0:13:29.260
Now, they have been reunited as a family through the prophetic revelation of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:13:29.260,0:13:35.360
Served with some rice and freshly squeezed orange juice they were ready to begin.

0:13:35.360,0:13:39.820
But before the meal, the family had something to say.

0:13:39.820,0:13:44.620
My name is Henry Nwajames.

0:13:44.620,0:13:50.840
The person by my side is my lovely wedded wife.

0:13:50.840,0:13:58.900
The person on my left side is my found daughter, whom I am just seeing for the first time after 28 years.

0:13:58.900,0:14:07.140
The brother here is my cousin who knows a little bit about us.

0:14:07.140,0:14:14.540
When we were playing all these pranks in those days when we were kids, he used to be there with me.

0:14:14.540,0:14:17.140
These are my grandchildren.

0:14:17.140,0:14:18.420
You can see how beautiful they are.

0:14:18.420,0:14:19.940
This is a blessing.

0:14:19.940,0:14:25.340
She is my daughter's first daughter and this is Uche, the son.

0:14:25.340,0:14:34.220
What brought me to The SCOAN was the prophecy that the man of God gave me sometime in 2012.

0:14:34.220,0:14:38.500
The man of God walked up to me.

0:14:38.500,0:14:43.140
I had prayed: "I want this man of God to meet me today; I want this man of God to speak to my situation".

0:14:43.140,0:14:47.300
I thought he was going to tell me that I would win the contract or that my millions would come tomorrow

0:14:47.300,0:14:51.360
but when he came to me, it hit me in a way that I could not understand.

0:14:51.360,0:14:53.920
He asked me where my wife was.

0:14:53.920,0:14:56.620
I replied that my wife had left for a meeting, right from the church.

0:14:56.620,0:14:58.600
He said that he meant my very first wife.

0:14:58.600,0:15:02.680
I told him that I have one wife and that she was my only wife.

0:15:02.680,0:15:06.200
He said that there was a controversy.

0:15:06.200,0:15:12.740
I could not understand or even remember that I once had an encounter sometime, somewhere.

0:15:12.740,0:15:20.500
I did not think that the prophecy had anything to do with me having abandoned my daughter.

0:15:20.500,0:15:28.280
When I got home, my wife who was not in the church at that moment, had already returned from her meeting.

0:15:28.280,0:15:32.740
So, she was at home with my mother, my other children and relations.

0:15:32.740,0:15:35.260
They were all watching Emmanuel TV and saw the whole thing.

0:15:35.260,0:15:40.940
When I got home, my wife pounced on me and asked me: "Have you forgotten the story you told me?

0:15:40.940,0:15:44.760
Where is the telephone number of your cousin?"

0:15:44.760,0:15:47.600
She asked me if I had forgotten about the girl I told her about.

0:15:47.600,0:15:51.940
I said: "No, the man of God did not say so. I did not marry her".

0:15:51.940,0:15:57.760
She said: "No, what the man of God said is not too far from this thing".

0:15:57.760,0:16:04.720
It was then that I took out my cousin's telephone number and she started calling my cousin immediately.

0:16:04.720,0:16:12.600
I didn't know that what had 'brushed' me down and shattered me was my ignorance at this big mistake

0:16:12.600,0:16:15.220
which I never knew.

0:16:15.220,0:16:21.820
Meanwhile on my own side, this had affected me tremendously.

0:16:21.820,0:16:24.120
I could not even understand myself anymore.

0:16:24.120,0:16:27.600
I was a big boy; I was doing so well.

0:16:27.600,0:16:34.640
I had projects in my village; I was the first to build a storied building.

0:16:34.640,0:16:36.640
At the end, I was selling my properties.

0:16:36.640,0:16:38.800
I had landed properties and sold all.

0:16:38.800,0:16:44.560
I went overseas and brought this and that but at the end of the day, I could not account for anything.

0:16:44.560,0:16:49.320
As I was coming to the church, I was praying that God would open my way

0:16:49.320,0:16:51.620
and show me the root cause of my problem.

0:16:51.620,0:16:57.580
As God would have it, that fateful day, the man of God prophesied to me.

0:16:57.580,0:17:01.280
When we got home, we focused on the prophecy and started looking for this girl

0:17:01.280,0:17:04.020
and that was how this discovery came about.

0:17:04.020,0:17:08.280
I thank God today that she is here and I have been appealing to her to forgive me.

0:17:08.280,0:17:11.200
This was what I did out of ignorance as a young man.

0:17:11.200,0:17:15.540
That time, I was afraid that if my relations saw me, they would kill me

0:17:15.540,0:17:19.360
or tell me that I had committed one abomination or the other.

0:17:19.360,0:17:23.240
That was why I left, not knowing that, that place was where my dad's mum came from.

0:17:23.240,0:17:24.860
I could have married from that village.

0:17:24.860,0:17:31.340
The only family I could not have married into was my cousin's family.

0:17:31.340,0:17:33.800
My mind was strengthened and I knew that God had forgiven me.

0:17:33.800,0:17:36.000
I didn't care what anybody would say.

0:17:36.000,0:17:40.520
My cousin, on his own part did his best because he always told me that

0:17:40.520,0:17:46.480
I was the only one that knew about this child and that I should not forget.

0:17:46.480,0:17:54.960
When he texted me, I didn't take it seriously.

0:17:54.960,0:17:57.840
My daughter, I'm very sorry.

0:17:57.840,0:18:01.680
I know I've sinned before God and before people.

0:18:01.680,0:18:05.200
But please, I am appealing to you, my daughter; forgive me.

0:18:05.200,0:18:11.300
Now that I have seen my daughter for the first time, after all these years, it is a fulfilled day.

0:18:11.300,0:18:12.540
I am happy.

0:18:12.540,0:18:14.440
My daughter, please, forgive me.

0:18:14.440,0:18:18.780
I am very sorry, my daughter, please, forgive me!

0:18:18.780,0:18:21.340
I promise to carry you along.

0:18:21.340,0:18:26.380
As far as I have seen you, nothing whatsoever will separate us anymore as long as the love of God

0:18:26.380,0:18:27.460
is working in our lives.

0:18:27.460,0:18:30.840
My daughter!
Thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:18:30.840,0:18:32.660
Thank You, Lord!

0:18:32.660,0:18:34.560
My name is Chidindu.

0:18:34.560,0:18:36.180
I am so happy.

0:18:36.180,0:18:38.000
I don't know what to say.

0:18:38.000,0:18:42.520
I thank God for today that He has made it possible for me to see a day like this.

0:18:42.520,0:18:45.680
I don't know how to say it.
I am overwhelmed.

0:18:45.680,0:18:53.080
I am so happy because all of my life, I didn't even know what a father was.

0:18:53.080,0:18:57.220
I had never ever tasted fatherly love.

0:18:57.220,0:18:59.660
Sometimes, I would go to my friends' houses;

0:18:59.660,0:19:05.480
their fathers would pamper them and I would ask God: "Who is my father?"

0:19:05.480,0:19:13.440
But today, God made it possible for me to see my father and mother.

0:19:13.440,0:19:17.440
She is my mother because without her, this would never had happened.

0:19:17.440,0:19:24.080
It is not every woman who can go through this and still fish out the person they had been looking for.

0:19:24.080,0:19:29.640
I will never ever in this life forget her because I am so happy.

0:19:29.640,0:19:34.220
Sometime ago, my husband used to ask me: "Are you sure you are going to see your father?"

0:19:34.220,0:19:38.780
I replied that he should not worry that one day, I would see my father.

0:19:38.780,0:19:41.780
This is unfortunate that he doesn't witness it today.

0:19:41.780,0:19:42.920
I am so happy.

0:19:42.920,0:19:49.440
Despite all that I have been through all my life, today, I am so happy!

0:19:49.440,0:19:52.600
God used the man of God to prophesy my case.

0:19:52.600,0:19:55.940
I was not here but God used him to prophecy my case.

0:19:55.940,0:20:03.460
I am so happy and I thank God and every member of this church who helped and witnessed today.

0:20:03.460,0:20:09.520
From today, I have forgiven my father.

0:20:09.520,0:20:11.100
I promise to remain your dad.

0:20:11.100,0:20:13.780
You are my first daughter.

0:20:13.780,0:20:15.400
We used to call a first daughter in my place, 'Ada'.

0:20:15.400,0:20:16.400
She is 'Ada'.

0:20:16.400,0:20:18.360
My name is Eddie Anyiam.

0:20:18.360,0:20:21.940
I thank God for today.

0:20:21.940,0:20:26.580
I witnessed my brother and his daughter.

0:20:26.580,0:20:31.780
I was there when the whole thing happened.

0:20:31.780,0:20:40.880
I promised my sister that I would keep the secret for security reasons, which I did.

0:20:40.880,0:20:49.720
Since then, things had not been easy for me because I was carrying a load that I was not able to bear.

0:20:49.720,0:21:01.180
One day, my sister came to me and told me that she did not want to go back to her uncle again.

0:21:01.180,0:21:02.560
I asked her why and whether there was any problem.

0:21:02.560,0:21:04.560
She replied that I would not understand.

0:21:04.560,0:21:10.520
I asked her why she said that I would not understand, that she should tell me.

0:21:10.520,0:21:13.800
She replied that she would not tell me.

0:21:13.800,0:21:20.540
We started to argue and she said that if I didn't want her to stay in my house, she would go.

0:21:20.540,0:21:30.860
I said: "Please, don't leave; let me settle this matter".

0:21:30.860,0:21:34.560
She said she didn't want to go to that place anymore, that she wanted to stay with me –

0:21:34.560,0:21:37.500
to take me as her brother – everything.

0:21:37.500,0:21:40.360
She said that those people were calling her a bastard.

0:21:40.360,0:21:45.360
When I heard that, I wondered why they were calling this young girl by that name,

0:21:45.360,0:21:48.340
was it because her mother was dead.

0:21:48.340,0:21:54.500
I told her that she was not a bastard and that she should calm down.

0:21:54.500,0:22:00.780
She told me that if she continued to go to that place, she would run away and commit suicide or drink poison.

0:22:00.780,0:22:09.380
I asked her not to kill herself, that I knew her dad, that she should keep the secret.

0:22:09.380,0:22:17.240
Today, I am happy that God has revealed the secret and I am happy that I have seen my brother.

0:22:17.240,0:22:23.000
I thank God for my brother's wife; she made it possible for us to be together.

0:22:23.000,0:22:27.080
This is my first time of coming to this church.

0:22:27.080,0:22:30.940
I lost my wife over five years ago.

0:22:30.940,0:22:37.740
I have one boy and one girl and I am not finding things easy.

0:22:37.740,0:22:43.380
I don’t know whether it was the curse of my sister, here that was causing me disappointment in life.

0:22:43.380,0:22:46.580
People would make promises to me but in the end, they would disappoint me.

0:22:46.580,0:22:50.400
But I thank God that the bondage has been removed.

0:22:50.400,0:22:58.000
I thank God for the man of God and for my cousin's wife and for my junior sister.

0:22:58.000,0:22:58.840
It is well.

0:22:58.840,0:23:02.000
From today I am a member of this church.

0:23:02.000,0:23:03.920
I have seen the work of God here.

0:23:03.920,0:23:07.080
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:23:07.080,0:23:11.000
My name is Ijeoma Nwajames.

0:23:11.000,0:23:15.340
I want to thank God for today because God has made it happen in my life.

0:23:15.340,0:23:17.920
I see these things happening in other families.

0:23:17.920,0:23:21.100
I have seen miracles since I've been watching Emmanuel TV.

0:23:21.100,0:23:28.920
This is a family, that when I entered into it newly in marriage, everything was there for me.

0:23:28.920,0:23:31.400
Money was there and fleets of cars.

0:23:31.400,0:23:33.380
I had pleasures.

0:23:33.380,0:23:36.340
I didn't know that the world could change all of a sudden.

0:23:36.340,0:23:39.000
I didn't know what was happening.

0:23:39.000,0:23:45.320
As I was living in luxury, I had seven biological children.

0:23:45.320,0:23:50.060
I didn't know that one day, I would be begging for food to take care of those children.

0:23:50.060,0:23:56.740
All of a sudden, everything started withering – going down.

0:23:56.740,0:23:57.740
We were all wondering.

0:23:57.740,0:24:00.000
Then, we didn't know about Emmanuel TV.

0:24:00.000,0:24:01.900
We were wondering what was happening.

0:24:01.900,0:24:04.700
We have attended a lot of churches.

0:24:04.700,0:24:08.360
Some churches we attended did some sacrifices.

0:24:08.360,0:24:11.400
A lot of things had happened in our lives.

0:24:11.400,0:24:13.420
We didn't know what was really happening.

0:24:13.420,0:24:18.340
When the man of God gave the prophecy, I called him,

0:24:18.340,0:24:22.200
though I was not in the church by the time the prophecy came.

0:24:22.200,0:24:25.040
I asked him about his first wife.

0:24:25.040,0:24:26.280
He said that he didn't have a first wife.

0:24:26.280,0:24:31.100
I reminded him about the story he told me.

0:24:31.100,0:24:35.220
We were praying that God would visit us the way He had visited other people.

0:24:35.220,0:24:44.900
When he told me about it, I told him that the prophecy was talking about this child, though the mother was late.

0:24:44.900,0:24:49.020
He said: "But the man of God did not say the controversy was about a child".

0:24:49.020,0:24:54.980
I said: "Do you want him to explain everything when you have already told him that you don't have a first wife?"

0:24:54.980,0:24:58.500
I understand what is happening and we have been watching Emmanuel TV

0:24:58.500,0:25:00.860
for a long time, that the man of God speaks in parables.

0:25:00.860,0:25:03.400
He had spoken it and it was all about this child.

0:25:03.400,0:25:05.960
I went and met the girl.

0:25:05.960,0:25:12.400
That day I met the girl, something spoke to my heart that the whole thing had come to an end.

0:25:12.400,0:25:14.920
Something told me that she was the daughter.

0:25:14.920,0:25:20.140
I held her and she was crying that: "So, I have a wonderful mum like this".

0:25:20.140,0:25:26.280
She held onto me and since that day, we have been talking; I kept calling her.

0:25:26.280,0:25:33.720
I try to show her love and today, everything has come to pass that this family has been united -

0:25:33.720,0:25:37.740
she has met her dad and the dad has met his daughter.

0:25:37.740,0:25:39.700
I called my daughter when I got home that day.

0:25:39.700,0:25:41.820
I said: "We have another 'Ada' somewhere."

0:25:41.820,0:25:43.280
She said: "How can it be?"

0:25:43.280,0:25:47.240
I said: "Daddy has another 'Ada' (first daughter) somewhere; that means you are no longer 'Ada'."

0:25:47.240,0:25:53.800
She said: "If daddy is truly the person who had the child, I don't have to argue about it;

0:25:53.800,0:25:55.960
she remains 'Ada' I am 'sister humble'."

0:25:55.960,0:25:57.780
We laughed.

0:25:57.780,0:26:01.120
Today, I know that when my children meet them, they will be glad

0:26:01.120,0:26:04.280
because they are all part of the Emmanuel TV family.

0:26:04.280,0:26:08.380
We are all happy to witness this happening today in our lives.

0:26:08.380,0:26:14.440
We accept you with our whole hearts and everything is yours.

0:26:14.440,0:26:19.500
My wonderful grandchildren – I am ready to serve these children from today.

0:26:19.500,0:26:24.160
Today is a new day in my life and family.

0:26:24.160,0:26:28.200
I am so happy about what the man of God is doing in this place.

0:26:28.200,0:26:33.960
I am a staunch follower of T.B. Joshua and I will continue to follow him 'til the end of the world.

0:26:33.960,0:26:37.340
It is certain that nothing can separate us.

0:26:37.340,0:26:43.760
I am very happy today and pray that as we reunite today, this family will remain in unity,

0:26:43.760,0:26:45.520
in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:26:45.520,0:26:49.360
As God continues to use T.B. Joshua to do the work of charity and humanity,

0:26:49.360,0:26:53.620
the Lord will continue to empower him and refresh him the more.

0:26:53.620,0:26:58.000
I pray that God will build this church and the gates of hell shall not prevail, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:26:58.000,0:27:01.520
I want to thank Emmanuel TV Partners – you are wonderful people.

0:27:01.520,0:27:04.040
I appreciate and applaud you.

0:27:04.040,0:27:05.320
Thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:27:05.320,0:27:07.720
In Jesus’ name we pray!

0:27:07.720,0:27:10.320
Emmanuel!

0:27:11.380,0:27:13.060
Thank you, my children.

This is the day that the Lord has made

0:27:23.860,0:27:28.640
We will rejoice and be glad in it

0:27:28.640,0:27:34.740
This is the day that the Lord has made

0:27:34.740,0:27:37.420
Thank you.

They begin their meal and it's time for Mr. Henry to show his fatherly side,

0:27:42.340,0:27:46.660
as he gives a spoon full of rice to his first daughter, receives his own

0:27:46.660,0:27:50.920
and then gives another to each of his grandchildren.

0:27:50.920,0:27:53.560
A new relationship has been established.

0:27:53.560,0:27:59.700
A new home has been built and this family has been restored to the glory of God.

0:27:59.700,0:28:00.760
Hallelujah.
