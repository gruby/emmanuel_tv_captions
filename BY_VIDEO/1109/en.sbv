0:00:00.000,0:00:04.100
There is a brother there who has a problem with his marriage - you have a marriage problem.

0:00:04.100,0:00:06.160
You and your wife are there. Please, come out.

0:00:06.160,0:00:07.680
Don't be shy.

0:00:07.680,0:00:13.380
The couple whom the prophecy concerns comes out to confirm the words of the man of God.

0:00:13.380,0:00:16.340
You will not leave this wife. She needs deliverance.

0:00:16.340,0:00:18.640
She has a spiritual husband. Okay?

0:00:18.640,0:00:19.340
Amen.

0:00:19.340,0:00:22.660
And as for you, you know this is the problem you have been facing.

0:00:22.660,0:00:23.400
Amen.

0:00:23.400,0:00:25.640
Disappointment has been your problem.

0:00:25.640,0:00:30.300
You always meet these people - spiritual husband.

0:00:30.300,0:00:31.360
This is not your first time.

0:00:31.360,0:00:33.100
You have experienced it in the past.

0:00:33.100,0:00:34.280
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:34.280,0:00:37.320
Disappointment is not from this woman alone.

0:00:37.320,0:00:39.120
You had disappointments in the past.

0:00:39.120,0:00:39.720
Amen.

0:00:39.720,0:00:43.500
Even this one has a very strong spiritual husband.

0:00:43.500,0:00:44.520
Amen.

0:00:44.520,0:00:45.680
Which one is "Amen"?

0:00:45.680,0:00:48.980
Whatever the man of God is saying is very true.

0:00:48.980,0:00:52.960
I am the man of whom the man of God said that I have a problem with the marriage.

0:00:52.960,0:00:56.340
I am a pastor and the speaker of the council.

0:00:56.340,0:01:01.100
My wife is here and she is having extramarital affairs.

0:01:01.100,0:01:03.680
It is disturbing my ministry.

0:01:03.680,0:01:05.800
Look! Did you listen to what I'm saying?

0:01:05.800,0:01:06.420
Yes, sir.

0:01:06.420,0:01:12.920
When somebody has a spiritual husband, she is not your wife; she is somebody's wife.

0:01:12.920,0:01:13.680
Okay?

0:01:13.680,0:01:14.680
Yes, I understand.

0:01:14.680,0:01:17.440
It means, the two of you married this woman.

0:01:17.440,0:01:19.100
So, okay?

0:01:19.100,0:01:19.960
Help us, Man of God.

0:01:19.960,0:01:21.240
You said you are a pastor.

0:01:21.240,0:01:22.280
Yes, Prophet.

0:01:22.280,0:01:28.220
Spiritual husband means, someone is in the spirit and you are in the physical

0:01:28.220,0:01:30.580
and the two of you married her.

0:01:30.580,0:01:31.460
Deliver us, Man of God.

0:01:31.460,0:01:33.900
How can you now claim that she is your wife?

0:01:33.900,0:01:36.860
This woman needs to be delivered. You will not leave this woman. Okay?

0:01:36.860,0:01:37.540
Amen.

0:01:37.540,0:01:38.420
She is a good woman.

0:01:38.420,0:01:40.720
Please, help us, Man of God.

0:01:40.720,0:01:42.000
This is what you are saying now -

0:01:42.000,0:01:46.820
you say, somebody is on the moon, somebody is on the sun, somebody is in the south.

0:01:46.820,0:01:49.200
Okay! You will be delivered. She is your wife.

0:01:49.200,0:01:51.300
Madam, how are you?

0:01:51.300,0:01:55.700
All her character and attitude is as a result of the spiritual husband. Okay?

0:01:55.700,0:01:57.660
Yes, Prophet.

0:01:57.660,0:02:00.920
If you don't deliver her and leave this woman, you will meet another one

0:02:00.920,0:02:06.660
that has two husbands in the spirit.

0:02:06.660,0:02:08.240
Thank you, Prophet.

0:02:08.240,0:02:11.640
So, don't worry. I want to be a part of your family. Okay?

0:02:11.640,0:02:12.300
Amen.

0:02:12.300,0:02:16.160
Thank you. It's alright.

0:02:16.160,0:02:18.940
Man of God, please, deliver me.

0:02:18.940,0:02:20.000
Don't worry.

0:02:20.000,0:02:27.600
At The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers spirit-filled prayers to the people, in Jesus' name.

0:02:27.600,0:02:35.100
And whatever that is planted in their lives that is not of God is commanded out, in Jesus' name.

0:02:35.100,0:02:39.880
Among them is the couple who received the word of prophecy during the service.

0:02:39.880,0:02:44.520
He prays for them and delivers them, in Jesus' name.

0:02:44.520,0:02:46.100
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:02:46.100,0:02:48.980
Who are you in her?

0:02:48.980,0:02:54.000
What have you done to her marriage?

0:02:54.000,0:02:55.100
No marriage there.

0:02:55.100,0:02:58.720
This is my wife. The marriage is not okay.

0:02:58.720,0:03:02.700
The man of God prophesied that there is a man here together with his wife

0:03:02.700,0:03:05.100
who has challenges in the marriage.

0:03:05.100,0:03:07.780
I confirm that is true.

0:03:07.780,0:03:12.160
The man of God also said that my wife has a spiritual husband.

0:03:12.160,0:03:16.160
This is the manifestation of what the man of God has said.

0:03:16.160,0:03:17.860
Thank God for the deliverance.

0:03:17.860,0:03:20.000
No marriage here.

0:03:20.000,0:03:21.100
Why did you say, "No marriage"?

0:03:21.100,0:03:21.900
No marriage here.

0:03:21.900,0:03:22.480
Why?

0:03:22.480,0:03:23.580
Do you see a marriage here?

0:03:23.580,0:03:24.600
What did you do to the marriage?

0:03:24.600,0:03:25.640
No marriage; it is finished.

0:03:25.640,0:03:26.600
What did you do to the marriage?

0:03:26.600,0:03:27.680
It is finished.

0:03:27.680,0:03:28.660
How did you do it?

0:03:28.660,0:03:30.340
I destroyed the marriage.

0:03:30.340,0:03:33.600
How? What did you push her to do against this marriage?

0:03:33.600,0:03:34.440
Speak out!

0:03:34.440,0:03:35.940
Look at me alone.

0:03:35.940,0:03:38.100
Who are you to her?

0:03:38.100,0:03:39.240
I am the husband.

0:03:39.240,0:03:42.240
How did you enter her?

0:03:42.240,0:03:43.420
When she was young.

0:03:43.420,0:03:46.500
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:03:46.500,0:03:51.260
With just a touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua, the lady and her husband

0:03:51.260,0:03:57.040
fall under the influence of the Holy Spirit and they are delivered, in Jesus' name.

0:03:57.040,0:03:58.360
Glory be to God!

0:03:58.360,0:04:02.000
Thank You, Jesus! My wife is delivered, my marriage is delivered.

0:04:02.000,0:04:03.320
We thank God.

0:04:03.320,0:04:08.060
Thank You, Jesus!

0:04:08.060,0:04:22.100
CHANGING LIVES

0:04:22.100,0:04:27.560
So viewers, when God speaks, changes are beginning.

0:04:27.560,0:04:31.340
Let's get ready to hear from Pastor Mokoena and his wife.

0:04:31.340,0:04:35.500
Good Morning to you, program directors.

0:04:35.500,0:04:38.500
My name is Pastor Mokoena.

0:04:38.500,0:04:43.200
Usually in my country, they call me Pastor Tony.

0:04:43.200,0:04:49.600
The woman sitting beside me is my beautiful wife. This is Lerato Mokoena.

0:04:49.600,0:04:58.600
It has never really been easy in our marriage.

0:04:58.600,0:05:03.540
We have been married for 15 years now.

0:05:03.540,0:05:10.300
In these 15 years of our marriage, we only enjoyed the marriage for two years.

0:05:10.300,0:05:13.060
It has really been tough.

0:05:13.060,0:05:18.600
Now you can understand - being 15 years in a marriage and enjoying it only for two years.

0:05:18.600,0:05:25.600
The rest of 13 years - it has been a pain. Pain after pain.

0:05:25.600,0:05:29.600
I would go to church with a broken heart.

0:05:29.600,0:05:35.380
But I would keep on persuading, preaching to the people of God.

0:05:35.380,0:05:42.080
And really, it was not an easy journey for both of us

0:05:42.080,0:05:49.080
because firstly, when I met her, there was that love between both of us.

0:05:49.080,0:05:56.600
We cannot tell what happened during our stay together.

0:05:56.600,0:06:05.460
Sometimes, I would be preaching in church and she'd just decide to take her handbag and leave the church.

0:06:05.460,0:06:09.980
That thing would be disturbing the entire congregation.

0:06:09.980,0:06:13.560
But people are used to things.

0:06:13.560,0:06:21.420
Actually, nobody in church could understand what was happening with my wife.

0:06:21.420,0:06:25.420
Sometimes, she couldn't even clean in the house, she would just leave the house dirty,

0:06:25.420,0:06:32.440
the dishes would be filling the ... I had to do all this housework -

0:06:32.440,0:06:35.960
I had to clean, I had to wash the dishes,

0:06:35.960,0:06:38.400
sometimes I even had to wash the clothes.

0:06:38.400,0:06:39.800
You mean her clothes?

0:06:39.800,0:06:42.960
Yes, even the children's.

0:06:42.960,0:06:49.100
Sometimes, when the children were going to school, I had to prepare them to go to school.

0:06:49.100,0:06:55.600
Sometimes, this young man, my elder son - he is 12 now -

0:06:55.600,0:07:04.440
when he was still a baby and crying all evening, my wife would just neglect him.

0:07:04.440,0:07:08.540
I had to take care of the son and try to make him sleep.

0:07:08.540,0:07:13.500
It has affected me mentally, it has affected the church -

0:07:13.500,0:07:15.400
some people would just come and leave,

0:07:15.400,0:07:20.400
saying that there is no union between the man of God and his wife.

0:07:20.400,0:07:27.160
You mean, was it that evident, that people could notice that your wife was not with you in the ministry?

0:07:27.160,0:07:29.600
Yes, madam. People would see it.

0:07:29.600,0:07:38.560
As I am saying to you, when I approached the pulpit to preach, she would just take her handbag and leave.

0:07:38.560,0:07:39.360
Right in the church?

0:07:39.360,0:07:40.400
Right in the church.

0:07:40.400,0:07:41.520
In the presence of the whole congregation?

0:07:41.520,0:07:44.460
Yes.

0:07:44.460,0:07:47.640
I would be so embarassed.

0:07:47.640,0:07:51.800
But because people came to church, there was a time, whereby I said,

0:07:51.800,0:07:59.340
"It is not about me but it is about the people of God who came to listen to what God is saying".

0:07:59.340,0:08:08.080
But the Lord really sustained us in the very same problem that we have faced in our marriage.

0:08:08.080,0:08:14.600
Sometimes, she could not even sleep with me.

0:08:14.600,0:08:19.060
She would just get off the bed and go to sleep on the couch.

0:08:19.060,0:08:22.500
It was a struggle.

0:08:22.500,0:08:29.500
Sometimes, people didn't understand. - "Why are you behaving in a manner that is not godly?"

0:08:29.500,0:08:35.400
They are not staying in your house; they don't know what is happening in your house.

0:08:35.400,0:08:36.900
And all they would do is just gossip and such.

0:08:36.900,0:08:43.920
Yes, gossiping and such - they would be pulling my name into the mud.

0:08:43.920,0:08:48.520
The church would be pulled into the mud. It was not an easy journey.

0:08:48.520,0:08:53.080
Some pastors - I would be there preaching on their pulpits.

0:08:53.080,0:09:00.480
They would see. Sometimes, people would talk to them, "There's no peace in that man's house".

0:09:00.480,0:09:06.760
I think at this point I would like to ask you a question, Pastor.

0:09:06.760,0:09:12.120
Going by the prophecy of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, when he gave you that prophecy

0:09:12.120,0:09:19.000
along with your wife, saying that your wife was being tormented by a spiritual husband -

0:09:19.000,0:09:25.300
tell us, what was life like - apart from the physical things you could see?

0:09:25.300,0:09:33.480
Did you experience any kind of attacks? With those habits she had - what was life like,

0:09:33.480,0:09:36.880
being tormented by this spiritual husband that possessed your wife?

0:09:36.880,0:09:42.300
Yes, this spiritual husband has tormented me so much.

0:09:42.300,0:09:54.100
In one of the years, the community called me to come and be part of the politics.

0:09:54.100,0:10:01.880
I just went there as a minister of the Gospel trying to assist the governor at that time

0:10:01.880,0:10:06.240
in the sphere of ministers' fraternal.

0:10:06.240,0:10:13.000
It happened, when her term finished, people wanted me to lead the community.

0:10:13.000,0:10:19.000
I accepted the call; I became a governor in the world.

0:10:19.000,0:10:25.200
It has never been easy in politics. I was hated all over.

0:10:25.200,0:10:30.860
But God saw me through until my term was over.

0:10:30.860,0:10:35.700
But before the term was over, there had been so many unrests in my community.

0:10:35.700,0:10:40.100
They wanted to burn my house, to burn the church

0:10:40.100,0:10:44.700
For what good reasons? Nobody can tell.

0:10:44.700,0:10:50.100
But by the mercy of the Lord, when my term was finished, I wanted to quit politics.

0:10:50.100,0:10:54.200
But the premier of my province said, "No, there is no need for you to quit.

0:10:54.200,0:10:58.800
We need people like you, we need ministers of God to assist us".

0:10:58.800,0:11:03.120
I accepted the call, I became the speaker of the council.

0:11:03.120,0:11:11.000
But still being a speaker, I was no longer handling a ward, whereby I interacted with people monthly,

0:11:11.000,0:11:16.900
except when we were going to do a public participation, where I would be assisting the ward councillors.

0:11:16.900,0:11:20.620
But this spiritual husband was still tormenting me.

0:11:20.620,0:11:27.580
People still wanted to... When you went on Facebook, they would be saying bad things about me.

0:11:27.580,0:11:32.100
They would be saying, "I must be removed as a speaker" - all those things.

0:11:32.100,0:11:38.300
But you can see that there was an evil force that has been pushing people to do such things to me.

0:11:38.300,0:11:41.540
At that time did you actually know that it was something spiritual

0:11:41.540,0:11:46.760
or you just thought that it was one of those things?

0:11:46.760,0:11:57.100
As I have been following Emmanuel TV, it came to my senses that there was a demon behind this.

0:11:57.100,0:12:01.280
I didn't even know that I would get used to such a situation.

0:12:01.280,0:12:11.540
Because it was hard on the street, in politics, hard in the house, church, meeting attacks -

0:12:11.540,0:12:16.300
I never had peace.

0:12:16.300,0:12:20.460
I think at this point I would like to ask madam:

0:12:20.460,0:12:23.620
Let's go back to the prophecy the man of God gave to you

0:12:23.620,0:12:28.340
during the service when he said that you had a spiritual husband.

0:12:28.340,0:12:31.600
I think the viewers would like to know, what it was like -

0:12:31.600,0:12:36.640
to be married not to a physical husband but a spiritual husband.

0:12:36.640,0:12:41.800
Just to confirm what your husband has been saying so far.

0:12:41.800,0:12:48.700
My name is Lerato Mokoena. I come from South Africa.

0:12:48.700,0:12:56.700
Coming to your question, I didn't have an idea that it could be that.

0:12:56.700,0:13:05.000
I knew we had a problem and, as he said, we both believed that there was a spirit behind it

0:13:05.000,0:13:12.140
but not specifically knowing what kind of spirit it was.

0:13:12.140,0:13:18.340
And when the man of God gave us the prophecy that this is a spiritual husband,

0:13:18.340,0:13:28.480
I could relate, I could understand that this is indeed what has been troubling us all our life.

0:13:28.480,0:13:39.940
Because I would always hear my husband complaining to me, "You are so loud,

0:13:39.940,0:13:48.780
you are so violent and you fight about even the smallest things".

0:13:48.780,0:13:57.040
His main complaint was that I was not submissive.

0:13:57.040,0:14:02.820
He would always utter words like, "There are two men in the house".

0:14:02.820,0:14:06.000
Yes, that's what I usually said.

0:14:06.000,0:14:10.960
I was saying, "You don't listen to me, you don't respect me, it's like we are two men in this house".

0:14:10.960,0:14:12.760
She behaved like a man?

0:14:12.760,0:14:15.540
She behaved like a man.

0:14:15.540,0:14:20.480
I would realise that he was not dealing with a woman.

0:14:20.480,0:14:24.960
He then became so abusive,

0:14:24.960,0:14:33.280
trying to enforce the respect and submission that he was requiring from me.

0:14:33.280,0:14:43.940
And I would still pray, I would still do what was expected of me like feeding my spirit

0:14:43.940,0:14:53.200
and I would go to church on sundays but during the week - no mid-week activities.

0:14:53.200,0:14:57.380
Can we say that at that time you were just doing those things

0:14:57.380,0:15:02.060
but your heart was not really focused on them?

0:15:02.060,0:15:06.920
At that time I thought everything was fine; I thought I was doing the right thing;

0:15:06.920,0:15:14.000
I thought all was still fine. But only to find out that I was just fooling myself.

0:15:14.000,0:15:16.180
Let me say, you had two faces then.

0:15:16.180,0:15:27.760
Maybe during this time you might be laughing but you were not actually laughing,

0:15:27.760,0:15:32.080
or going to the church, helping your husband in the ministerial affairs

0:15:32.080,0:15:35.280
and you were not actually doing that on the outside.

0:15:35.280,0:15:39.300
You had two natures which people did not really understand.

0:15:39.300,0:15:45.220
Yes, because I would feel that he did not want me there, he did not need my help.

0:15:45.220,0:15:54.120
Hence, I would stay back and not be involved in most of the activities that were happening in church.

0:15:54.120,0:16:03.020
Because in a way, the reflection I would have of him was that he didn't want me to be involved.

0:16:03.020,0:16:06.260
That was what came into my head.

0:16:06.260,0:16:09.580
From what you have just explained now, I think the viewers will understand

0:16:09.580,0:16:17.440
that this was basically two natures of madam and two faces because as she said,

0:16:17.440,0:16:24.500
people did not really see the deeper side of her, that there was something behind this behavior of hers.

0:16:24.500,0:16:31.000
I mean when she laughed, she was not actually laughing because there was a demonic influence somewhere.

0:16:31.000,0:16:32.600
A demonic force.

0:16:32.600,0:16:38.000
Because sometimes, when I was preaching, she would be holding her phone, playing with it.

0:16:38.000,0:16:41.380
Lerato, can I just chip this in?

0:16:41.380,0:16:46.800
Because at that time, when you were having this crisis in your marriage,

0:16:46.800,0:16:52.600
was it like a constant war in your heart - maybe one desires to do the right thing,

0:16:52.600,0:16:57.400
one desires to be submissive, then another voice would tell you, "No!"

0:16:57.400,0:17:03.080
and bring his wrongs to you - and that would make you react negatively?

0:17:03.080,0:17:08.720
So I think that is what Folake means by saying that you had like two faces.

0:17:08.720,0:17:17.000
Yes. At times I would just say, "From now on, going forward, I am just going to do what he wants.

0:17:17.000,0:17:29.120
I am just going to make sure that everything he asks from me, I will do it and I won't wait until he complains".

0:17:29.120,0:17:36.780
Especially concerning the issues that he was talking about - that I was not washing his clothes.

0:17:36.780,0:17:42.980
I would have a problem, especially with the underclothes. He would complain.

0:17:42.980,0:17:47.100
Even if I could do other things, I would not do them.

0:17:47.100,0:17:52.200
But at some point I would tell myself, "I am just going to do everything right,

0:17:52.200,0:17:56.580
I am just going to do the laundry, I am just going to do..."

0:17:56.580,0:18:03.500
But only to find out, it didn't happen. I didn't do it, and when he came home,

0:18:03.500,0:18:07.280
sometimes I would be apologising, sometimes I would be just quiet,

0:18:07.280,0:18:10.620
saying in my heart, "Why don't you do it yourself?"

0:18:10.620,0:18:15.600
That's what Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we don't have enough physical strength to fight satan.

0:18:15.600,0:18:21.840
Once the force behind it is satanic, demonic, physically we cannot fight this battle.

0:18:21.840,0:18:23.700
It's just by the strengh of God.

0:18:23.700,0:18:24.860
It's very true.

0:18:24.860,0:18:27.720
CHANGING LIVES

0:18:27.720,0:18:35.160
It has never really been easy in our marriage.

0:18:35.160,0:18:40.040
We have been married for 15 years now.

0:18:40.040,0:18:46.800
In these 15 years of our marriage, we have only enjoyed the marriage for two years.

0:18:46.800,0:18:49.720
It has really been tough.

0:18:49.720,0:18:53.720
Now you can understand - being 15 years in a marriage, enjoying only for two years.

0:18:53.720,0:18:55.300
I understand.

0:18:55.300,0:19:01.400
Sometimes, she would just leave me alone in the house and visit another town

0:19:01.400,0:19:04.120
so that she could not come to church on Sunday,

0:19:04.120,0:19:10.240
so that she could go to another church rather than coming to my ministry.

0:19:10.240,0:19:17.100
Sometimes, being a minister of the Gospel, you can assist people to grow.

0:19:17.100,0:19:21.840
Some would come to church without knowing how to play the keyboard, instruments -

0:19:21.840,0:19:27.060
you would find people to train them. Once they know - they think they know - they leave.

0:19:27.060,0:19:30.400
There were times when in my ministry, we didn't have a keyboardist.

0:19:30.400,0:19:35.800
My elder son would be helping me playing the CD, when I preached.

0:19:35.800,0:19:41.100
He would just put the CD and play it, and I would preach.

0:19:41.100,0:19:47.700
Do you know what was happening? To show that it was an evil force that was pushing my wife,

0:19:47.700,0:19:54.040
she would take the very same person who was trying to assist me in the ministry,

0:19:54.040,0:19:58.820
together with his younger brother, to another place

0:19:58.820,0:20:03.120
so that I would stay there alone and struggle with the work of God.

0:20:03.120,0:20:10.660
So can you just let us know what finally happened that she agreed to come with you to The SCOAN?

0:20:10.660,0:20:18.800
As I was saying, I had tried to persuade her to come, but she even said to me,

0:20:18.800,0:20:22.800
"I am not going to go to The SCOAN".

0:20:22.800,0:20:25.000
She told you plainly.

0:20:25.000,0:20:30.780
"I am not going to go to The SCOAN." But I kept on praying.

0:20:30.780,0:20:36.440
I had prayed a lot for us to come here. Sometimes, I would be fasting for 21 days,

0:20:36.440,0:20:43.800
praying for God's intervention because I knew, once we came here, solution would come.

0:20:43.800,0:20:47.740
Actually, we were at the edge of divorce.

0:20:47.740,0:20:53.800
But I just said, "Let me come to The SCOAN so that we can get God's opinion".

0:20:53.800,0:20:59.480
By the mercy of the Lord she ended up agreeing to come with me to The SCOAN.

0:20:59.480,0:21:09.100
And actually, a few days before we came, she was driving home after work

0:21:09.100,0:21:15.760
and she had an accident. And I told her, "No, don't worry about that".

0:21:15.760,0:21:21.660
We know, every time when we plan to go, all the spirits will be trying to fight, doing whatever.

0:21:21.660,0:21:31.000
She had an accident, her car got scratched, the person they hit - the mirror just broke and fell down.

0:21:31.000,0:21:37.100
She came home. And we were still struggling to find her passport.

0:21:37.100,0:21:40.100
So many things were just...

0:21:40.100,0:21:45.820
The man of God usually says, when you are getting close to your breakthrough,

0:21:45.820,0:21:49.300
then the battle becomes hotter.

0:21:49.300,0:21:53.280
So I think, from what you just said - that means that her deliverance started from home.

0:21:53.280,0:21:54.140
Yes.

0:21:54.140,0:21:56.500
If not, there was no way, she would have followed you to The SCOAN.

0:21:56.500,0:21:57.720
Yes.

0:21:57.720,0:22:01.600
Sometimes, it even happens in real life, I mean in the world there,

0:22:01.600,0:22:05.340
you would just see some hardened, very tough criminal just wake up in the morning

0:22:05.340,0:22:07.360
and say, "Can you take me to Jesus".

0:22:07.360,0:22:12.800
What happened? You know, that nothing starts from outside the home - it must start from home.

0:22:12.800,0:22:17.500
Charity begins at home. That is why she agreed first at home.

0:22:17.500,0:22:20.300
And that was why she decided to come to The SCOAN.

0:22:20.300,0:22:28.820
Lerato, I think I would like to ask you one more question before we wrap up.

0:22:28.820,0:22:32.960
At the time the man of God touched you, when you finally came here,

0:22:32.960,0:22:38.120
and after the prophecy, you were opportuned to be at the prayer line.

0:22:38.120,0:22:43.600
When the man of God gave you that touch, tell us - what did you experience at that time?

0:22:43.600,0:22:50.500
Immediately the man of God laid his hand on me, I felt so angry.

0:22:50.500,0:22:53.920
I don't know why.

0:22:53.920,0:23:04.780
When I was standing in the queue, I was anxious, hoping that this was my time to receive a touch.

0:23:04.780,0:23:10.500
But the moment he laid his hand on me, it was like he was provoking,

0:23:10.500,0:23:17.660
it was like he pushed a wrong button.

0:23:17.660,0:23:22.000
I felt like I didn't know what was wrong with me now

0:23:22.000,0:23:28.400
and what I can remember is that I felt anger.

0:23:28.400,0:23:35.640
Exactly! Because at that time - we could see from the clip - you were kicking.

0:23:35.640,0:23:37.600
She even kicked me!

0:23:37.600,0:23:41.020
You gave your husband a karate kick.

0:23:41.020,0:23:44.980
Karate kick? Me?

0:23:44.980,0:23:48.180
You were so unconcious of everything around you. You kicked!

0:23:48.180,0:23:52.000
And even the men around could not hold you!

0:23:52.000,0:23:53.560
How many men?

0:23:53.560,0:23:55.500
Can we say, like two or three men?

0:23:55.500,0:23:57.980
They were many there!

0:23:57.980,0:24:00.040
You were kicking.

0:24:00.040,0:24:04.780
I was very surprised because the very same leg that she kicked me with -

0:24:04.780,0:24:11.400
she had an ankle problem. So I was surprised. Today the lady is now able to walk.

0:24:11.400,0:24:15.480
You should ask yourself, "How come a leg with a problem was able to kick?"

0:24:15.480,0:24:17.460
To show you that there was another leg!

0:24:17.460,0:24:19.740
That was that spiritual husband's leg.

0:24:19.740,0:24:22.280
That's why when the man of God gave the prophecy, he said,

0:24:22.280,0:24:28.300
"Man, this woman, she has two men - you and another man in the spirit".

0:24:28.300,0:24:30.000
We saw that evil man manifest that day.

0:24:30.000,0:24:35.740
Yes. When I got the kick, I said, "No, that man is kicking me now".

0:24:35.740,0:24:37.500
Yes, that's true.

0:24:37.500,0:24:45.860
Going by that experience you had, you said, it just got you angry.

0:24:45.860,0:24:52.200
It shows that you sensed that touch from Heaven; that fire was upon you.

0:24:52.200,0:24:53.000
I believe so.

0:24:53.000,0:24:57.980
And it was that fire of the Holy Spirit you received through the touch of the man of God,

0:24:57.980,0:25:02.560
Prophet T.B. Joshua, that made you so unconsious of everything

0:25:02.560,0:25:04.560
because it was a touch from the Holy Spirit.

0:25:04.560,0:25:10.980
It was the power of God that descended on you and made that demon to manifest.

0:25:10.980,0:25:16.880
And you became unconsious of your enviroment because you were influenced by the Holy Spirit.

0:25:16.880,0:25:21.520
So it was a great experience and we know that it was that experience

0:25:21.520,0:25:25.060
that has brought this beautiful smile on your face.

0:25:25.060,0:25:33.480
I really thank God for that moment. I can't explain how I feel now,

0:25:33.480,0:25:38.760
after that life changing touch - I will call it my "miracle touch".

0:25:38.760,0:25:42.800
What do you want to tell viewers about that touch?

0:25:42.800,0:25:54.340
Viewers, everyone needs that touch. Because even after that, I still feel that hammer on my head.

0:25:54.340,0:26:03.000
And when I went to bed to sleep, it was like I was a baby. I slept peacefully.

0:26:03.000,0:26:10.100
And I enjoyed my sleep. Even in the morning when I woke up, I felt so light and I thank God for that.

0:26:10.100,0:26:16.780
I don't have words to explain how my life is now.

0:26:16.780,0:26:26.000
Even the morning after my deliverance, I woke up with the joy of the Lord overflowing in my spirit.

0:26:26.000,0:26:36.160
The first thing I did that morning was just to call my husband to find out how he was.

0:26:36.160,0:26:40.980
I felt really like I missed him already.

0:26:40.980,0:26:48.560
I felt differently from all other days about how I feel about him.

0:26:48.560,0:26:50.420
And I thank God for that.

0:26:50.420,0:26:58.340
And how did you feel when you received that call - first of its kind in 15 years of marriage?

0:26:58.340,0:27:05.420
It was an overwhelmimg moment - something that I've been longing for for years.

0:27:05.420,0:27:11.200
I had always been complaining to her that if I didn't check on her, she didn't check on me.

0:27:11.200,0:27:14.460
It takes two to tango.

0:27:14.460,0:27:18.920
I felt so very blessed when she called me that morning.

0:27:18.920,0:27:24.460
One thing that she forgot to mention - immediately after that touch from Heaven,

0:27:24.460,0:27:29.540
the very same ankle that was having  a pain - that pain was gone.

0:27:29.540,0:27:33.200
She has been trying to check - the pain was no longer there.

0:27:33.200,0:27:34.200
Thank You, Jesus.

0:27:34.200,0:27:37.240
So it was not just deliverance from that spiritual husband.

0:27:37.240,0:27:39.780
Everything about her health was restored.

0:27:39.780,0:27:45.200
Yes, it was indeed. As we were staying there, we were going up the stairs.

0:27:45.200,0:27:54.100
Every time I would climb stairs - one stair with both feet, first one and second one.

0:27:54.100,0:27:56.640
The next one - the first one and the second one.

0:27:56.640,0:28:02.600
Every time I had to make sure that I started with the right one and pulled the aching one.

0:28:02.600,0:28:08.460
But now I am able to climb up and down the stairs without pain.

0:28:08.460,0:28:15.000
Even at night, I would be twisting my ankle just to check if the pain is there

0:28:15.000,0:28:18.300
but to the glory of the Lord, no pains until now.

0:28:18.300,0:28:20.780
And your children - have you heard from them?

0:28:20.780,0:28:24.680
Yes, we heard from them.

0:28:24.680,0:28:31.500
Even today we were speaking to them - they are all well.

0:28:31.500,0:28:42.400
I believe, when we get back home, we will be a joyous family together, we will be a happy family

0:28:42.400,0:28:52.200
to the glory of the Lord, we will do God's work together, holding hands and closing every rank

0:28:52.200,0:28:57.100
that was there before the deliverance and do God's work.

0:28:57.100,0:29:02.720
Folake, would you want to give us the question from our viewers?

0:29:02.720,0:29:07.400
Pastor Abraham and the wife, what you have shared with us so far has been very educative

0:29:07.400,0:29:11.600
and I believe our viewers have really enjoyed it - the experience you have shared so far.

0:29:11.600,0:29:16.600
We would like to ask you many questions, if you don't mind but time will not permit us.

0:29:16.600,0:29:20.600
We just want to take one of the many questions that have come in to our program today.

0:29:20.600,0:29:24.100
And it's from Pastor Eric from the USA and he is asking about the changes

0:29:24.100,0:29:27.000
you have both seen in your marriage after the deliverance.

0:29:27.000,0:29:31.600
Thank you very much for such a beautiful question.

0:29:31.600,0:29:38.000
After the deliverance, we are now eating together.

0:29:38.000,0:29:44.000
She can feed me, I can feed her which was the thing that was no longer happening.

0:29:44.000,0:29:50.000
We even study and read the Word of God together. We feel very blessed with that.

0:29:50.000,0:29:53.900
We will now be planning the future together.

0:29:53.900,0:29:59.200
It's nice. We are walking around here holding hands

0:29:59.200,0:30:05.600
which was a thing that was no longer happening in our marriage.

0:30:05.600,0:30:11.500
We thank God. Indeed, it's a new beginning of our marriage.

0:30:11.500,0:30:21.000
I'm drunk in love. I'm really happy.

0:30:21.000,0:30:31.200
One statement he said to me was, "I wish we can get married now.

0:30:31.200,0:30:34.640
We will do everything afresh now".

0:30:34.640,0:30:41.160
I think that this is really something that will highlight this whole thing,

0:30:41.160,0:30:45.540
this whole new beginning that we are experiencing now.

0:30:45.540,0:30:50.800
I will never stop thanking God for this revival

0:30:50.800,0:30:58.600
because now a new thing has been born and I will never stop telling my husband

0:30:58.600,0:31:06.560
how much he means to me and I will be that woman that he expects me to be,

0:31:06.560,0:31:12.560
that woman that is abiding by the standards of the Word of God

0:31:12.560,0:31:19.480
and do exactly what is expected of me as a woman, especially one who is married to a man of God

0:31:19.480,0:31:27.340
who needs my support, my prayers, who needs me beside him in everything he is doing.

0:31:27.340,0:31:35.500
So I have really made a decision that I will stick, I will be there -

0:31:35.500,0:31:40.900
as long as God is by my side, I can do great exploits.

0:31:40.900,0:31:45.160
Yes, we know that as Mrs Mokoena has made that decision,

0:31:45.160,0:31:48.780
God will definitely give you the energy for the distance.

0:31:48.780,0:31:50.160
We really thank God for this.

0:31:50.160,0:31:51.140
Thank you.

0:31:51.140,0:31:58.140
On that note, we want to really thank you for coming and sharing this experience with our viewers.

0:31:58.140,0:32:03.000
We know they have also been blessed, touched

0:32:03.000,0:32:07.480
and their lives will never be the same by this your experience. Thank you.

0:32:07.480,0:32:09.440
We also thank you for the invitation.

0:32:09.440,0:32:13.500
Viewers, we have heard it all.

0:32:13.500,0:32:18.800
A relationship does not involve two perfect people.

0:32:18.800,0:32:24.700
I mean such perfect people don't exist on this planet.

0:32:24.700,0:32:31.200
You're very right, Folake. Because the origin of any relationship is God,

0:32:31.200,0:32:35.260
and if God does not release us and we quit a relationship

0:32:35.260,0:32:39.760
or reject anyone on account of their weakness,

0:32:39.760,0:32:46.980
we will quit the next relationship in the same manner and even the next one after it.

0:32:46.980,0:32:52.340
I think you're right, Ann. Relationship is all about beneficial cooperation.

0:32:52.340,0:33:00.060
Human relationship is very important, especially in an institution such as marriage.

0:33:00.060,0:33:01.200
Exactly.

0:33:01.200,0:33:04.960
But I'm just surprised of what is happening all over the world today -

0:33:04.960,0:33:10.600
distrust, infidelity have been the order of the day in most marriages.

0:33:10.600,0:33:12.320
Exactly, Folake.

0:33:12.320,0:33:17.540
And I think we need to know God's time in this matter.

0:33:17.540,0:33:27.620
If you look at Malachi 2:16, God declared, "For I hate divorce". And that is God speaking.

0:33:27.620,0:33:28.600
Exactly.

0:33:28.600,0:33:34.100
So what does this mean to couples all over the world?

0:33:34.100,0:33:42.800
It means that as a child of God, divorce is never the will of God for your marriage.

0:33:42.800,0:33:48.340
And when a situation like this arises, what do we need to do?

0:33:48.340,0:33:54.000
We need to dig deep and fight it through.

0:33:54.000,0:34:00.360
There are powers in this world that will naturally want us to be bowed down in bondage,

0:34:00.360,0:34:06.240
and if we fail to realise this, we will continue to fight the wrong battle,

0:34:06.240,0:34:11.300
we will continue to disengage ourselves from the wrong relationships,

0:34:11.300,0:34:17.500
we will continue to do the wrong things and affect our homes, our marriages.

0:34:17.500,0:34:24.620
So there are powers that want us to be bowed down in bondage - we must begin to realise this.

0:34:24.620,0:34:29.020
I personally have never seen where hatred would overcome love.

0:34:29.020,0:34:30.280
Never.

0:34:30.280,0:34:33.500
Love of God overcomes.

0:34:33.500,0:34:37.720
If you have the love of God in your heart, you will overcome,

0:34:37.720,0:34:42.440
just as Pastor Mokoena and his wife did.

0:34:42.440,0:34:51.360
So viewers, show the love of God in your relationship and you will overcome the challenges that you face.

0:34:51.360,0:34:56.200
On this note, we will draw the curtain on today's program.

0:34:56.200,0:34:58.700
From me, Anne - remain blessed.

0:34:58.700,0:35:02.200
And from me, Folake - stay in faith.
