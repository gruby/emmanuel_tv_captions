0:00:00.000,0:00:01.300
How are you?

0:00:01.300,0:00:04.040
I'm well - thank you, Sir.
How are you?

0:00:04.040,0:00:06.940
Where you were living before, you are no longer there.

0:00:06.940,0:00:09.120
It's true.

0:00:09.120,0:00:10.980
Where you were before, you are no longer there.

0:00:10.980,0:00:13.040
You just left. Transition.

0:00:13.040,0:00:16.820
You want to leave your husband; you are already in the process of divorce.

0:00:16.820,0:00:18.000
Yes, man of God.

0:00:18.000,0:00:18.760
What happened?

0:00:18.760,0:00:23.400
I'm in the process of divorcing, man of God.

0:00:23.400,0:00:24.880
I just left my home.

0:00:24.880,0:00:29.300
Clap for Jesus Christ.

0:00:29.300,0:00:30.600
I want to see you.

0:00:30.600,0:00:34.460
You have to receive counselling before you take this step.

0:00:34.460,0:00:36.980
In your home, divorce, divorce and divorce.

0:00:36.980,0:00:37.960
That's true, man of God.

0:00:37.960,0:00:41.020
You are the only person who has a stable home.

0:00:41.020,0:00:42.540
That’s very true, sir.

0:00:42.540,0:00:49.840
And two; internet – I want to advise you over it.

0:00:49.840,0:00:51.680
Yes, man of God.

0:00:51.680,0:00:57.020
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:00:57.020,0:00:59.240
My name is Linda Ejiogu.

0:00:59.240,0:01:06.060
I am a South African married to a Nigerian.

0:01:06.060,0:01:12.140
The prophecy the man of God gave me last week Sunday was on point.

0:01:12.140,0:01:21.300
The first thing he said to me was that I had moved houses.

0:01:21.300,0:01:24.860
What was happening was that there was a spirit of divorce

0:01:24.860,0:01:30.560
that is in my family and there was transition in my life.

0:01:30.560,0:01:33.800
He mentioned something about the internet.

0:01:33.800,0:01:43.400
The prophecy the man of God said is very true because on 9th February 2014, I moved out of my marital house.

0:01:43.400,0:01:49.800
I had been living there with my husband for 17 years.

0:01:49.800,0:01:59.000
I left the house because he had been very abusive to me all these years.

0:01:59.000,0:02:04.120
He would threaten to kill me, to pour acid on me.

0:02:04.120,0:02:07.540
He would hit me in front of my kids.

0:02:07.540,0:02:11.260
He had done many things to me; he would stab me.

0:02:11.260,0:02:16.640
I don’t even buy knives in my house because I am scared of him.

0:02:16.640,0:02:23.740
He always threatened me; he has a very big problem with anger.

0:02:23.740,0:02:32.760
And other things; they were not major things to me to leave the marriage, but cheating...

0:02:32.760,0:02:36.320
He has cheated on me; he is a serial cheater.

0:02:36.320,0:02:42.020
He has numerous girlfriends in South Africa and in Nigeria.

0:02:42.020,0:02:44.180
There is nothing he doesn’t do.

0:02:44.180,0:02:52.540
Married women, single, young, old, he is following them.

0:02:52.540,0:02:57.600
Since 2004, he took away my daughter.

0:02:57.600,0:03:02.020
I brought the child here to Nigeria; I came with her.

0:03:02.020,0:03:06.460
That girl, I left her in 2006.

0:03:06.460,0:03:08.860
We are talking of reconciliation.

0:03:08.860,0:03:11.460
I will not want you to go too far.

0:03:11.460,0:03:13.980
I think my brother is around.

0:03:13.980,0:03:15.180
Yes, man of God.

0:03:15.180,0:03:18.260
Let me see my brother; I don't want you to go too far.

0:03:18.260,0:03:20.420
We are talking of reconciliation.

0:03:20.420,0:03:21.600
You have said your own story.

0:03:21.600,0:03:27.060
If my brother is around too, he has his own side of story.

0:03:27.060,0:03:33.700
My brother - thank you for honouring me and coming here today - thank you very much.

0:03:33.700,0:03:36.860
Thank you man of God - it is a pleasure to see you.

0:03:36.860,0:03:43.740
Let him stand here.

0:03:43.740,0:03:45.940
Do you have any other thing you want to say?

0:03:45.940,0:03:47.360
I do, man of God.

0:03:47.360,0:03:53.980
What I want to say is that I have a daughter here since eight years now.

0:03:53.980,0:03:55.820
And this child...

0:03:55.820,0:03:58.000
It was an argument between him and I

0:03:58.000,0:04:03.440
that she would come here to attend school and learn the culture.

0:04:03.440,0:04:06.800
Since then, I have not seen my child.

0:04:06.800,0:04:07.860
It is all right.

0:04:07.860,0:04:11.000
Let me hear from my brother here.

0:04:11.000,0:04:16.100
Don't cry, don't begin to get sympathy to your side.

0:04:16.100,0:04:19.220
It is God Almighty that brings this matter.

0:04:19.220,0:04:26.060
You came to the Synagogue on your own and you were here for a different thing.

0:04:26.060,0:04:31.500
You carried placard; what was written on the placard was different from what I was telling you.

0:04:31.500,0:04:35.840
You never put it on the paper that this was your problem but you had a different problem.

0:04:35.840,0:04:41.740
When I got to you, I was telling you what was not revealed on the paper.

0:04:41.740,0:04:44.460
So, it was God who was talking.

0:04:44.460,0:04:45.340
OK?

0:04:45.340,0:04:53.940
If God can bring such a secret story out, the same God should tell you people the outcome.

0:04:53.940,0:04:57.240
OK, brother - I want to thank you for...

0:04:57.240,0:05:02.400
After the prophecy was given and I asked her where was her husband,

0:05:02.400,0:05:04.820
she said he was in South Africa, isn't it?

0:05:04.820,0:05:05.700
Yes, man of God.

0:05:05.700,0:05:08.300
I said, "I want to see your husband".

0:05:08.300,0:05:13.920
Thank God, you say he is a Nigerian - he can not hear my voice and say he would not come.

0:05:13.920,0:05:18.900
Immediately we made a call to the man and he came, just because of the prophecy.

0:05:18.900,0:05:22.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:22.200,0:05:27.280
Just because of the prophecy... and you know the marriage is broken already.

0:05:27.280,0:05:32.420
There is nothing like marriage any more but just because he heard me talking.

0:05:32.420,0:05:38.980
He could have said, "No, I don't need to go there, the woman is no longer my wife, what am I going to do?"

0:05:38.980,0:05:42.120
But he said, "I have to be there because man of God is calling me".

0:05:42.120,0:05:44.040
So, thank you for that.

0:05:44.040,0:05:46.040
Let's hear from you.

0:05:46.040,0:05:47.620
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:05:47.620,0:05:51.340
My name is Chief Maxwell Ejiogu

0:05:51.340,0:05:55.040
I am from Imo State, Nigeria.

0:05:55.040,0:05:57.660
I reside in South Africa.

0:05:57.660,0:06:01.780
I have been in South Africa for 17 years.

0:06:01.780,0:06:06.880
The lady beside me here is my wife.

0:06:06.880,0:06:16.180
First of all, before I go into detail, I would like to thank God who made it possible

0:06:16.180,0:06:22.720
for me to be here today through the prophecy given to my family

0:06:22.720,0:06:27.220
through our humble man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:06:27.220,0:06:29.460
I thank you so much.

0:06:29.460,0:06:33.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:33.600,0:06:39.520
OK, you say our sister beside you is your wife or ex-wife - what are you saying?

0:06:39.520,0:06:41.520
She is still my wife for now.

0:06:41.520,0:06:43.120
Thank you very much.

0:06:43.120,0:06:47.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:47.780,0:06:51.780
Thank you.

0:06:51.780,0:06:55.840
Because he has the fear of God, and for him to say that...

0:06:55.840,0:06:57.980
OK, let's hear.

0:06:57.980,0:07:03.560
Without wasting much of our time, I would like to go into detail.

0:07:03.560,0:07:09.220
The prophecy the man of God gave us is true.

0:07:09.220,0:07:12.320
I have the documents here.

0:07:12.320,0:07:17.280
It is a confirmed prophecy.

0:07:17.280,0:07:19.880
I have heard what my wife said.

0:07:19.880,0:07:25.100
The issue is that I love my wife.

0:07:25.100,0:07:32.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:32.140,0:07:41.380
My sister - thank you.

0:07:41.380,0:07:51.300
As I was saying, since I met my wife in 1997, the first problem we had was alcohol.

0:07:51.300,0:07:54.180
There is a hotel that is called Mimosa.

0:07:54.180,0:07:56.480
She asked me to take her there.

0:07:56.480,0:07:57.860
I took her there.

0:07:57.860,0:08:04.040
When she was drinking, I told her that I wanted to go and sleep.

0:08:04.040,0:08:05.180
Let us go.

0:08:05.180,0:08:10.300
She attacked me with a bottle of beer.

0:08:10.300,0:08:16.300
I am a kind of person who is shy; I just pretended and went upstairs.

0:08:16.300,0:08:18.520
She followed me.

0:08:18.520,0:08:24.000
She took a bottle and attacked me, took a chair and hit me on my head.

0:08:24.000,0:08:26.980
OK, when she was under the influence of alcohol... ?

0:08:26.980,0:08:28.180
Alcohol.
Thank you.

0:08:28.180,0:08:34.120
It was not her; it was when she was under the influence of alcohol.

0:08:34.120,0:08:36.580
There were two people.

0:08:36.580,0:08:39.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:39.560,0:08:42.140
There were two people talking.

0:08:42.140,0:08:46.500
When she was under the influence of alcohol she attacked,

0:08:46.500,0:08:50.560
but when she is not under the influence of alcohol - she is a good woman.

0:08:50.560,0:08:53.100
OK, thank you - go ahead.

0:08:53.100,0:08:59.140
Since that day, fighting over alcohol and smoking never stopped in my family.

0:08:59.140,0:09:04.800
I had endured it for 17 years but this thing did not stop.

0:09:04.800,0:09:10.180
She mingles with people who are divorced.

0:09:10.180,0:09:13.180
If I told her something, she wouldn’t listen to me.

0:09:13.180,0:09:17.240
When she is under the influence of alcohol.

0:09:17.240,0:09:17.940
Thank you.

0:09:17.940,0:09:20.220
She goes out in the morning...

0:09:20.220,0:09:21.160
OK.

0:09:21.160,0:09:23.700
You know this is not the way you married her.

0:09:23.700,0:09:27.500
You never saw her under the influence of alcohol when you married her.

0:09:27.500,0:09:28.660
Yes, I never saw her.

0:09:28.660,0:09:29.580
OK, thank you.

0:09:29.580,0:09:32.540
You too you have some blame.

0:09:32.540,0:09:37.880
You married somebody who you never saw under the influence of alcohol.

0:09:37.880,0:09:41.660
Suddenly, when she started living with you, she started taking alcohol.

0:09:41.660,0:09:44.500
Where were you when she started it?

0:09:44.500,0:09:52.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:52.080,0:09:54.040
OK, you can leave the issue of alcohol.

0:09:54.040,0:09:58.880
We know what anyone can do under the influence of alcohol.

0:09:58.880,0:10:01.560
They can even do worse than things you are talking about.

0:10:01.560,0:10:04.560
Forget about being under the influence of alcohol.

0:10:04.560,0:10:06.960
Tell us the other side of the story, sir.

0:10:06.960,0:10:09.240
Thank you for your coming once again.

0:10:09.240,0:10:13.900
Man of God, sometimes, she would go out in the morning

0:10:13.900,0:10:19.660
and come back the following day, 1 or 2 am.

0:10:19.660,0:10:22.340
She would be drunk and driving my kids.

0:10:22.340,0:10:25.400
When I talked, the next thing she would so is call the police.

0:10:25.400,0:10:30.760
She would tell me that the women of South Africa have got the right, 50:50.

0:10:30.760,0:10:32.340
That would hurt me.

0:10:32.340,0:10:37.980
I would tell her, "Listen, before I married you, I told you that I have culture.

0:10:37.980,0:10:44.660
You knew that I am a traditionalist and a titled man, respect me.

0:10:44.660,0:10:49.900
I don’t like a situation where I give you a law or tell you, "don’t do this

0:10:49.900,0:10:56.320
and you do it a hundred times, that makes me angry and I have a hot temper."

0:10:56.320,0:11:04.000
When I start enduring this, enduring that, there will be an extent where I will not be able to take it any more.

0:11:04.000,0:11:05.780
Fighting will burst out.

0:11:05.780,0:11:09.680
She had been taking me to court and putting me in jail.

0:11:09.680,0:11:14.740
Sometimes, I would be in for one week, three days without eating inside the cell.

0:11:14.740,0:11:18.300
She would be able to do whatever she wanted to do inside the house.

0:11:18.300,0:11:22.780
Afterwards, my brother would have to beg her so that she would release me.

0:11:22.780,0:11:24.200
In the police station?

0:11:24.200,0:11:25.420
In the police station.

0:11:25.420,0:11:30.120
OK, you went to station - you were in the prison for how many days?

0:11:30.120,0:11:37.700
Sometimes she could put me in police custody for three days, sometimes one week.

0:11:37.700,0:11:44.060
And what makes me angry so much - I love my kids, I don't play with my kids.

0:11:44.060,0:11:46.320
OK, thank you uncle.

0:11:46.320,0:11:48.740
My daughter, thank you.

0:11:48.740,0:11:52.700
There is something you said that covers it all.

0:11:52.700,0:11:54.940
You said, "She is my wife".

0:11:54.940,0:11:55.840
She is my wife.

0:11:55.840,0:11:57.120
And you love her so much.

0:11:57.120,0:11:58.180
I love her so much.

0:11:58.180,0:11:59.300
Thank you very much.

0:11:59.300,0:12:04.440
The person you love so much and the person that is your wife

0:12:04.440,0:12:08.380
is the person that is not under the influence of alcohol.

0:12:08.380,0:12:11.980
Here is T.B. Joshua.

0:12:11.980,0:12:16.060
She needs deliverance, you need deliverance.

0:12:16.060,0:12:21.960
After the deliverance we will have our real persons, our real value.

0:12:21.960,0:12:26.300
Your real value - you will discover it. 
Her real value - she will discover it.

0:12:26.300,0:12:30.060
Now, the love you are talking about is still there.

0:12:30.060,0:12:31.140
Thank you.

0:12:31.140,0:12:40.600
So now, all the story - we realize that our sister here was under the influence of alcohol,

0:12:40.600,0:12:42.940
that is why all those things were happening.

0:12:42.940,0:12:45.420
She is not her.

0:12:45.420,0:12:51.180
It is that spirit - so, therefore it is not her.

0:12:51.180,0:13:00.040
Like I have said - when you met her and married her, you never saw her as a drunkard.

0:13:00.040,0:13:09.960
It was when she got to your house, in one way or the other she saw you taking alcohol but not so much of it.

0:13:09.960,0:13:17.020
But a little boy - when you show him how to jump, he will want to jump more and more.

0:13:17.020,0:13:18.180
That it is.

0:13:18.180,0:13:23.700
So, I want to tell you, "thank you very much for the love have for me".

0:13:23.700,0:13:25.540
I want to come to this marriage.

0:13:25.540,0:13:27.140
God is here.

0:13:27.140,0:13:30.680
I want to tell you, this marriage is from God.

0:13:30.680,0:13:36.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:36.100,0:13:37.220
It is from God.

0:13:37.220,0:13:40.200
After the deliverance I will pray with you people.

0:13:40.200,0:13:45.920
I want to meet you people for a discussion, to let you know that...

0:13:45.920,0:13:50.340
Please, let us put our past behind us and more forward.

0:13:50.340,0:13:55.860
It is not by accident you met him; it is not by accident you met her.

0:13:55.860,0:13:57.740
This is a marriage.

0:13:57.740,0:14:02.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:02.960,0:14:09.360
Whatever she must have done to you in the past, please put it behind you.

0:14:09.360,0:14:09.960
OK?

0:14:09.960,0:14:15.480
The Lord that said, "thou shall not drink alcohol", also said, "thou shall not smoke, thou shall not fornicate".

0:14:15.480,0:14:17.940
If you have drunk alcohol - you have fornicated...

0:14:17.940,0:14:20.700
So please, let's put everything behind and move forward.

0:14:20.700,0:14:22.520
God is still saying something.

0:14:22.520,0:14:27.440
We shouldn’t look at the wrong; let us look at what God says about the wrong.

0:14:27.440,0:14:35.060
Tell your neighbour: "Don't look at the wrong; listen to what God says about that wrong".

0:14:35.060,0:14:44.500
God sometimes uses the wrong to speak to us, to teach us a lesson

0:14:44.500,0:14:49.800
and to prepare us or to strengthen the marriage.

0:14:49.800,0:14:55.280
God will sometimes allow this wrong to happen in order to strengthen the marriage.

0:14:55.280,0:14:59.440
It is mostly misunderstanding that is standing the marriage.

0:14:59.440,0:15:04.220
When you see any wonderful marriage today -

0:15:04.220,0:15:09.400
if you know how many misunderstandings they have gone through, before they established

0:15:09.400,0:15:11.740
that solid and wonderful marriage.

0:15:11.740,0:15:15.900
They have gone through the valley of shadow of death.

0:15:15.900,0:15:22.200
There is no marriage that grew strong by understanding.

0:15:22.200,0:15:25.900
Misunderstanding will come many times before understanding.

0:15:25.900,0:15:31.880
There can be no understanding without misunderstanding.

0:15:31.880,0:15:34.240
There can be no understanding without what?

0:15:34.240,0:15:35.600
[Misunderstanding.]

0:15:35.600,0:15:38.060
There can be no right without wrong.

0:15:38.060,0:15:39.320
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:39.320,0:15:41.460
"There can be no right without wrong."

0:15:41.460,0:15:43.880
There can be no right without wrong.

0:15:43.880,0:15:45.940
[There can be no right without wrong.]

0:15:45.940,0:15:49.000
There can be no understanding without misunderstanding.

0:15:49.000,0:15:52.180
[There can be no understanding without misunderstanding.]

0:15:52.180,0:15:54.260
Please, I want to meet you people.

0:15:54.260,0:16:00.800
If I allow you to talk, sir - I think we will just continue to repeat ourselves.

0:16:00.800,0:16:06.100
I know you want to answer her; she says you had many concubines...

0:16:06.100,0:16:09.660
You want to answer her by saying she has many boyfriends...

0:16:09.660,0:16:10.740
If I'm right...

0:16:10.740,0:16:15.080
You are right, Man of God.

0:16:15.080,0:16:16.820
What are we going to say about that?

0:16:16.820,0:16:20.100
You have many concubines - you too, you have many boyfriends.

0:16:20.100,0:16:22.780
You have many black - you too have many black.

0:16:22.780,0:16:25.160
You have many hurts - you too have many hurts.

0:16:25.160,0:16:29.620
So, we know, you continue to repeat yourself - because you have stated those points

0:16:29.620,0:16:31.080
you want to answer her.

0:16:31.080,0:16:34.420
Please, let's put everything behind us.

0:16:34.420,0:16:36.460
Thank you, my sister.

0:16:36.460,0:16:38.220
Thank you for coming.

0:16:38.220,0:16:42.660
I want to thank you for just accepting my call.

0:16:42.660,0:16:45.020
I will want to join this marriage.

0:16:45.020,0:16:46.480
You people are to wait for me.

0:16:46.480,0:16:47.660
You go to the prayer line.

0:16:47.660,0:16:49.380
I know the worst has happened.

0:16:49.380,0:16:52.020
The same worst will now bring the best.

0:16:52.020,0:16:55.160
[Amen.]

0:16:55.160,0:17:00.740
Yes. Therefore - let everybody go and seat separately for now.

0:17:00.740,0:17:03.460
Because they have been sitting separately, they never came together.

0:17:03.460,0:17:05.900
So, they have to do the same thing until prayer line.

0:17:05.900,0:17:09.120
After prayer line I will be the one to bring them together.

0:17:09.120,0:17:11.200
OK, uncle - you can go back to your seat here.

0:17:11.200,0:17:11.940
[Thank you man of God.]

0:17:11.940,0:17:14.220
You go back to your seat.

0:17:14.220,0:17:16.900
It's too soon to begin to say, "hug yourself".

0:17:16.900,0:17:19.400
No - that is not an issue of a hug.

0:17:19.400,0:17:21.860
There are issues on the ground already.

0:17:21.860,0:17:24.040
So, we have to disclose before we hug.

0:17:24.040,0:17:31.280
Man of God, please I want you to collect this divorce summons from me from the High Court.

0:17:31.280,0:17:36.640
My sister, come out.

0:17:36.640,0:17:38.500
Can you see what I'm talking about?

0:17:38.500,0:17:41.380
There is a court issue already.

0:17:41.380,0:17:43.960
There is a divorce order against me.

0:17:43.960,0:17:45.000
By my sister?

0:17:45.000,0:17:46.220
She filed it.

0:17:46.220,0:17:48.220
This one is for the children’s court.

0:17:48.220,0:17:49.700
It is still going on.

0:17:49.700,0:17:51.400
This one is for the divorce.

0:17:51.400,0:17:52.220
It is still going on.

0:17:52.220,0:17:52.940
There is another one…

0:17:52.940,0:17:54.580
No - it's all right.

0:17:54.580,0:17:57.760
You know I said, that I could not ask you to hug here .

0:17:57.760,0:18:00.200
For you to know that I know what is on the ground...

0:18:00.200,0:18:02.620
After the deliverance I still need to sit with them.

0:18:02.620,0:18:04.260
We are in the midway.

0:18:04.260,0:18:07.260
OK, here is my sister, you are my brother.

0:18:07.260,0:18:10.300
Give me, I will give it to my sister.

0:18:10.300,0:18:11.560
My sister will get it.

0:18:11.560,0:18:12.800
Help me to hold it.

0:18:12.800,0:18:13.700
Thank you.

0:18:13.700,0:18:15.460
Help me to hold it, my sister.

0:18:15.460,0:18:17.020
You keep it for me.

0:18:17.020,0:18:18.540
Go and sit down.

0:18:18.540,0:18:21.440
My sister, come here.

0:18:21.440,0:18:27.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:27.880,0:18:29.020
You know what happened?

0:18:29.020,0:18:31.440
My sister collected it and...

0:18:31.440,0:18:35.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:35.560,0:18:37.060
She will give me it.

0:18:37.060,0:18:39.240
After the prayer I will collect it back.

0:18:39.240,0:18:43.760
We will discuss, I will answer: "what happened?" - "you have gone too far".

0:18:43.760,0:18:46.320
Divorce already - you have sent the divorce documents.

0:18:46.320,0:18:49.340
You will be the one to go ahead and do the rest.

0:18:49.340,0:18:53.540
You will go and withdraw it by yourself.

0:18:53.540,0:18:54.200
Can you see?

0:18:54.200,0:18:59.380
I said I could not ask them to hug themselves because I know there are many issues to be settled.

0:18:59.380,0:19:02.080
Suddenly they come here saying there is a divorce letter.

0:19:02.080,0:19:13.040
TESTIMONY TIME

0:19:13.040,0:19:16.880
My name is Linda Ejiogu.

0:19:16.880,0:19:27.020
The gentleman standing next to me is my husband Maxwell Ejiogu.

0:19:27.020,0:19:38.520
Beside him is our first daughter, after her our son and his auntie - my husband's older sister.

0:19:38.520,0:19:41.400
that takes care of them.

0:19:41.400,0:19:42.900
You are very welcome once again.

0:19:42.900,0:19:46.700
Can you just recount to us the first day you came here - you received that prophecy.

0:19:46.700,0:19:51.880
Tell us once again what the man of God said to you and how that word of prophecy was true for your life.

0:19:51.880,0:19:58.400
As I was standing in the prayer line I had that expectation within me

0:19:58.400,0:20:02.040
because I knew exactly what I came here for.

0:20:02.040,0:20:09.960
On the placard I have put what was written on the medical report.

0:20:09.960,0:20:12.800
But you cannot hide from God.

0:20:12.800,0:20:16.020
God knew how I was feeling at that time.

0:20:16.020,0:20:22.580
He had to come to us through the man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:22.580,0:20:27.680
The man of God told me exactly what was happening in our lives.

0:20:27.680,0:20:33.400
That day - it was about three weeks after my moving out.

0:20:33.400,0:20:37.120
I filed for divorce.

0:20:37.120,0:20:42.300
Prophet said that the spirit of divorce was in my family - which was very true.

0:20:42.300,0:20:47.160
I was the one who was still married - it's very true.

0:20:47.160,0:20:51.740
Prophet spoke to me and told me everything that I knew.

0:20:51.740,0:20:57.760
I was not in shock though because I knew he was a real man of God.

0:20:57.760,0:21:03.180
I prayed to God that He would speak if this marriage was really from Him.

0:21:03.180,0:21:08.360
God will come through for us - for me to be able to save the marriage.

0:21:08.360,0:21:13.540
After the prophecy, by the grace of God, your husband was invited to The SCOAN.

0:21:13.540,0:21:15.780
He flew all the way from South Africa.

0:21:15.780,0:21:18.860
Tell us what happened last week during the service, when the man of God -

0:21:18.860,0:21:21.580
Prophet T.B. Joshua addressed this issue.

0:21:21.580,0:21:35.860
During the service when I had to testify, the man of God called my husband who then confessed his love for me.

0:21:35.860,0:21:42.100
That was something that I knew, and he knew that I loved him too.

0:21:42.100,0:21:50.180
My husband mentioned his own grievances to the man of God.

0:21:50.180,0:21:53.380
From then...

0:21:53.380,0:21:59.460
The thing that caused all this he was talking about - my drinking, going out, I drove with my kids while being drunk and all that -

0:21:59.460,0:22:03.680
it was because of loneliness.

0:22:03.680,0:22:10.040
I felt rejected and I would just leave the house and go out.

0:22:10.040,0:22:15.880
When I saw him here last Friday, we were not even talking, we stared at each other.

0:22:15.880,0:22:22.180
After the deliverance something strange happened.

0:22:22.180,0:22:24.860
The anger I had...

0:22:24.860,0:22:27.420
The way I felt has just changed.

0:22:27.420,0:22:30.840
I felt peace within me.

0:22:30.840,0:22:40.880
I had that urge - this marriage can still work, we can still do things right.

0:22:40.880,0:22:56.120
I thank God for The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV, because without it we wouldn't know that there is a living God.

0:22:56.120,0:23:02.660
Our kids would have been raised like us - which I fought against my whole life.

0:23:02.660,0:23:10.200
I wanted my kids to be raised by me and my husband as a family.

0:23:10.200,0:23:14.160
Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:23:14.160,0:23:20.480
Madam, during the course of the service last week, after yourself and your husband had explained the challenges

0:23:20.480,0:23:25.820
you were facing, the man of God made a statement that it was deliverance that you and your husband needed,

0:23:25.820,0:23:28.440
and that this was indeed a marriage from Heaven.

0:23:28.440,0:23:33.800
Now, can you just testify - ever since your received prayer from the man of God at the prayer line,

0:23:33.800,0:23:38.340
and God revealed that in the service - what were the changes that you've seen in your relationship

0:23:38.340,0:23:42.580
with your husband in this week, and what do you want to testify about that?

0:23:42.580,0:23:52.600
From Monday we started to have conversation, and it was more calm, in the sense that he could listen,

0:23:52.600,0:23:56.820
I could finish my sentence without him biting my head off.

0:23:56.820,0:24:00.820
We started talking, communicating very well.

0:24:00.820,0:24:08.580
There is an open communication now, whereby I can explain something to him and he would listen attentively

0:24:08.580,0:24:11.740
and acknowledged that he had heard what I had been saying.

0:24:11.740,0:24:16.140
God has delivered us and it is permanent, in the mighty name of Jesus.

0:24:16.140,0:24:17.600
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:24:17.600,0:24:23.140
Tell us; ever since the deliverance - do you still have that urge to smoke or drink or go outside?

0:24:23.140,0:24:27.180
Well, since the deliverance I don't have that urge for anything.

0:24:27.180,0:24:30.480
I'm calm, I'm at peace with myself.

0:24:30.480,0:24:36.440
Those things happened when I was angry - I just snaped out - I was like, "Well, let me just go out there".

0:24:36.440,0:24:39.100
But now I'm very much at peace.

0:24:39.100,0:24:42.420
I really thank God for delivering us.

0:24:42.420,0:24:44.980
How have you been sleeping ever since that deliverance?

0:24:44.980,0:24:49.060
I sleep really peacefully.

0:24:49.060,0:24:51.040
I find it easy to sleep.

0:24:51.040,0:24:56.860
I don't turn and start thinking way forward or way back.

0:24:56.860,0:25:00.860
I just believe that all is well with me and my family.

0:25:00.860,0:25:02.000
Thank You, Jesus.

0:25:02.000,0:25:08.400
Finally, last week, publicly the divorce letter was brought out and the man of God actually handed it over to you.

0:25:08.400,0:25:13.700
Tell us what is your decision concerning that particular letter.

0:25:13.700,0:25:20.380
Well, the divorce papers are with me right now.

0:25:20.380,0:25:22.220
When I go back to South Africa...

0:25:22.220,0:25:25.220
They were issued from the High Court in Pretoria.

0:25:25.220,0:25:34.600
When I go back now, I will speak to my lawyer and I will withdraw the divorce because...

0:25:34.600,0:25:37.360
I know that our marriage has been healed.

0:25:37.360,0:25:41.980
We are looking forward to greater things, peace and harmony.

0:25:41.980,0:25:42.980
Thank you.

0:25:42.980,0:25:47.360
Well, let's put our hands together for our Lord; Jesus Christ!

0:25:47.360,0:25:53.540
We thank God Almighty; how God has really intervened in this marriage and thank God, through this word

0:25:53.540,0:25:59.700
of prophecy and the deliverance, the couple is no longer gonna go through divorce, but is going to continue

0:25:59.700,0:26:02.000
to live together in Christ Jesus.

0:26:02.000,0:26:04.500
Indeed, this is the power of prophecy.

0:26:04.500,0:26:06.660
We give all the glory to our Lord; Jesus Christ.

0:26:06.660,0:26:10.220
Finally madam, I believe with the experience you have passed through in this marriage,

0:26:10.220,0:26:12.960
you have a lot of advises and lessons for people to learn from.

0:26:12.960,0:26:17.540
What is your advise to people watching you right now, especially to married couples?

0:26:17.540,0:26:24.200
What I would advise is: seek the face of God and the foundation of the marriage is very important.

0:26:24.200,0:26:28.140
We got married when we were very young.

0:26:28.140,0:26:32.000
There was no proper foundation, there was no God there.

0:26:32.000,0:26:35.340
I think that people need counselling before they get married.

0:26:35.340,0:26:41.500
They need to know God, they need to know what they are putting that marriage into.

0:26:41.500,0:26:46.620
Right now, I believe that our marriage has a new foundation.

0:26:46.620,0:26:56.080
I thank God for the prophecy, for the generosity in this place, for the love that was given to us.

0:26:56.080,0:26:56.960
Thank you.

0:26:56.960,0:27:01.060
Right now, we would like to hear few words from your husband as well.

0:27:01.060,0:27:01.800
Sir, you are welcome.

0:27:01.800,0:27:07.780
If you could introduce yourself to us and tell us your own experiences and your own testimony.

0:27:07.780,0:27:10.660
My name is Maxwell Ejiogu.

0:27:10.660,0:27:21.060
First of all, I thank God Almighty, who made it possible for us to be here.

Last week, when we were here, I was standing here with my wife

0:27:26.860,0:27:31.380
but we were not able to look into each others eyes.

0:27:31.380,0:27:35.380
Today, we can look into each others eyes.

0:27:35.380,0:27:41.140
So...

0:27:41.140,0:27:54.560
I thank God for that and I thank our prophet T.B. Joshua, who described the problem in the family.

0:27:54.560,0:27:56.620
Because to me...

0:27:56.620,0:28:02.600
I have already decided to welcome this divorce.

0:28:02.600,0:28:04.740
She knows me.

0:28:04.740,0:28:08.340
It can take me a minute to decide what I want to do.

0:28:08.340,0:28:12.040
She knows what I am capable of.

0:28:12.040,0:28:23.840
But God saw it and picked it and dealt with it - glory be to God.

0:28:23.840,0:28:27.600
Tell us sir, ever since you spoke out last weekend's service...

0:28:27.600,0:28:31.420
The man of God, prophet T.B. Joshua said it was deliverance that was needed both on your side,

0:28:31.420,0:28:32.520
and on her side.

0:28:32.520,0:28:34.120
He prayed for both of you.

0:28:34.120,0:28:37.660
What are the changes in your relationship with your wife ever since then?

0:28:37.660,0:28:47.220
That last Sunday, when I came here, when I had a handshake with man of God I felt something.

0:28:47.220,0:28:49.480
Something happened in my life.

0:28:49.480,0:28:57.260
At the beginning I was very angry with my wife and I said that there was nobody who could change my mind.

0:28:57.260,0:29:04.500
I told her, she knows; as you already gave me those summons - I'm fine.

0:29:04.500,0:29:10.500
After my handshake with man of God I felt something.

0:29:10.500,0:29:17.240
My anger started to reduce.

0:29:17.240,0:29:22.900
I couldn't know what to say any more so I just kept quiet.

0:29:22.900,0:29:34.920
When he said that this marriage was from heaven - I was finished, I couldn't...

0:29:34.920,0:29:41.000
That day man of God conducted the deliverance for both of us.

0:29:41.000,0:29:44.260
To be honest - I'm very calm.

0:29:44.260,0:29:45.500
I'm no more stressed.

0:29:45.500,0:29:49.280
I don't think of worldly things.

0:29:49.280,0:29:50.380
I'm OK.

0:29:50.380,0:29:54.100
We can talk, we can interact, we can relate now.

0:29:54.100,0:29:56.260
We can share ideas.

0:29:56.260,0:30:01.020
I believe everything is normal in our relationship.

0:30:01.020,0:30:06.500
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:30:06.500,0:30:08.940
What a wonderful testimony.

0:30:08.940,0:30:12.940
We give glory to God Almighty for restoring this marriage.

0:30:12.940,0:30:16.140
Indeed, only our Lord Jesus Christ could do this.

0:30:16.140,0:30:20.780
Right now sir, your wife has just said that she is going to withdraw that divorce letter.

0:30:20.780,0:30:24.180
How do you feel hearing that?

0:30:24.180,0:30:31.520
I felt good because the order is from above; she has to do it.

0:30:31.520,0:30:39.780
So, I'm happy that she is withdrawing the summon.

0:30:39.780,0:30:40.360
Hellelujah.

0:30:40.360,0:30:45.000
We thank Jesus Christ for indeed restoring this marriage.

0:30:45.000,0:30:47.320
We can actually see that you have your children here.

0:30:47.320,0:30:50.580
We just want to hear quick word from your daughter as well.

0:30:50.580,0:30:53.060
Sister, tell us your name and where you are from.

0:30:53.060,0:30:57.660
My name is Ejiogu.

0:30:57.660,0:31:02.060
What can you say about what Jesus Christ has done for your parents?

0:31:02.060,0:31:06.400
I am so happy for what Jesus Christ done for me because

0:31:06.400,0:31:15.400
when I heard that my father and mum wanted to divorce I felt so sad and I felt like crying.

0:31:15.400,0:31:16.380
But right now?

0:31:16.380,0:31:19.100
I feel happy.

0:31:19.100,0:31:23.680
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:31:23.680,0:31:29.780
Well, to the glory of God we want to encourage this family, now, when they made the Word of God

0:31:29.780,0:31:33.180
the standard for their lives - they must continue to stay close to Jesus.

0:31:33.180,0:31:38.800
We can see that our mother here is crying tears of joy knowing that God has finally reconciled this marriage.

0:31:38.800,0:31:43.640
We want to encourage you to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives as you do so

0:31:43.640,0:31:46.240
the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:31:46.240,0:31:52.360
[Amen.]

0:31:52.360,0:31:58.400
