0:00:00.000,0:00:03.580
Turn to your neigbour and greet them, "Good Morning".

0:00:03.580,0:00:06.780
Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:06.780,0:00:10.620
Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:10.620,0:00:14.920
Give the neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:14.920,0:00:19.140
Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:19.140,0:00:25.620
and greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Good Morning!"

Yes, you may have your seats in the presence of God.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:36.420,0:00:40.760
Wow! Thank You, Jesus, for the wonderful grace to be here.

0:00:40.760,0:00:44.380
Just before delving into today's message,

0:00:44.380,0:00:51.540
I want to make one thing very clear;

0:00:51.540,0:00:59.460
whatever you will hear from me today and whatever you will see in my life today

0:00:59.460,0:01:09.140
is as a direct result of the amazing grace of God in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:09.140,0:01:16.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:16.460,0:01:23.980
At a time where selfishness reigns supreme and materialism runs rife,

0:01:23.980,0:01:35.240
it's so rare and precious to see someone who so selflessly, sacrificially gives his time,

0:01:35.240,0:01:41.920
love, resources, energy, his whole life to the advancement of God's Kingdom

0:01:41.920,0:01:46.560
and to the development of others.

0:01:46.560,0:01:55.480
Prophet T.B. Joshua is not a man seeking fame or fortune, wealth or material positions - no!

0:01:55.480,0:02:00.520
He is a man after God's own heart.

0:02:00.520,0:02:04.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:04.620,0:02:10.600
You and I know that this ministry, we could have branches in every country all over the world.

0:02:10.600,0:02:12.160
People are demanding it.

0:02:12.160,0:02:17.300
We could build a cathedral that could seat the largest, highest number of people.

0:02:17.300,0:02:22.600
But Prophet T.B. Joshua knows that these are not the things that are tests to our genuineness.

0:02:22.600,0:02:25.120
These are not the strengths of the ministry.

0:02:25.120,0:02:28.700
The strength of the ministry is the Holy Spirit.

0:02:28.700,0:02:33.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:33.640,0:02:35.800
You heard the instructions from God.

0:02:35.800,0:02:39.800
Even now, Prophet T.B. Joshua is removing the overflow congregation

0:02:39.800,0:02:47.460
because obedience is better than sacrifice.

0:02:47.460,0:02:54.880
He is not interested in building structures; he is interested in building people.

0:02:54.880,0:03:03.940
He is not concerned about populating this church but populating the Kingdom of God - Heaven.

0:03:03.940,0:03:06.220
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:03:06.220,0:03:10.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:10.660,0:03:15.260
Today I want to ask you a question.

0:03:15.260,0:03:19.580
This is a question that I believe may have run through your mind before

0:03:19.580,0:03:24.040
and it's a very important issue that we need to talk to ourselves as children of God,

0:03:24.040,0:03:27.060
to examine ourselves in the light of God's Word.

0:03:27.060,0:03:32.760
Why is it that so often, we repeat our wrong,

0:03:32.760,0:03:39.380
we return to our mistakes even after we have seen the repercussions?

0:03:39.380,0:03:41.860
I mean, just examine your life.

0:03:41.860,0:03:46.240
You know the price you pay anytime you misbehave.

0:03:46.240,0:03:48.300
You know the damage that is done -

0:03:48.300,0:03:56.320
damage that is done to you heart, relationships, business, career, destiny, just name it

0:03:56.320,0:03:58.940
Anytime you misbehave, you know what happens.

0:03:58.940,0:04:06.580
Yet, time and time again, we seem to so easily fall into the trap of satan.

0:04:06.580,0:04:09.420
We easily fall for satan's tricks;

0:04:09.420,0:04:15.480
we are so easily enticed, ensnared and entrapped.

0:04:15.480,0:04:16.980
Like Prophet T.B. Joshua said:

0:04:16.980,0:04:25.720
We just see the outward effects of the devil but we seem to be blind to the spiritual cause.

0:04:25.720,0:04:34.020
We are concerned with the fruits; we look at the fruits instead of striking the root.

0:04:34.020,0:04:38.920
This is what I want to talk about today and I just want to share a very quick story.

0:04:38.920,0:04:43.880
This is a true story, a real life experience that happened.

0:04:43.880,0:04:46.700
It was here in the church. I remember it very vividly.

0:04:46.700,0:04:51.800
We were doing a time of counselling on Monday for those that received healing and deliverance.

0:04:51.800,0:04:57.520
A young man came to where the evangelists were and he was crying his eyes out.

0:04:57.520,0:05:02.300
He was distraught, distressed.

0:05:02.300,0:05:07.620
His tears could evoke sympathy from even the stoniest of hearts.

0:05:07.620,0:05:13.140
If you saw the way this guy was crying, wailing, moaning, grumbling…

0:05:13.140,0:05:17.000
In the midst of this, we were trying to find out what was happening, what was going on.

0:05:17.000,0:05:22.000
Long story short, we were able to decipher through the pain, the tears and the cries

0:05:22.000,0:05:28.460
that this young man was a happily married man, two children, great job, picture-perfect life

0:05:28.460,0:05:32.760
when suddenly something happened.

0:05:32.760,0:05:39.580
One day, he received a friend request on Facebook from a lady he did not know and he just accepted.

0:05:39.580,0:05:45.060
One thing led to another - discussions started, exchange of words, conversations, pictures.

0:05:45.060,0:05:48.400
Later, he went to go and meet that very same lady.

0:05:48.400,0:05:53.500
And before he knew it, sin had entered.

0:05:53.500,0:06:01.720
Unknown to him, that lady attended the same college as his wife.

0:06:01.720,0:06:09.580
Through a mutual friend, the secret was leaked, and the wife took away the children and left home.

0:06:09.580,0:06:11.500
This man was distraught, crying.

0:06:11.500,0:06:18.960
He made one statement, "Satan sent this Jezebel, Delilah to come and destroy my marriage“.

0:06:18.960,0:06:22.380
But we tried to probe and go deep to the root of the issue.

0:06:22.380,0:06:26.460
We asked the brother a question, "Brother, who accepted the friend request?"

0:06:26.460,0:06:28.740
He said, "It was me".

0:06:28.740,0:06:31.700
"Who initiated the conversation with this lady?"

0:06:31.700,0:06:33.040
"Me."

0:06:33.040,0:06:35.400
"Who asked for her picture?"

0:06:35.400,0:06:37.400
"Me."

0:06:37.400,0:06:40.980
"Who suggested that you meet up and arranged a meeting with her?"

0:06:40.980,0:06:41.960
"Me."

0:06:41.960,0:06:46.280
"Who put a password on your phone so that your wife will not suspect what is going on?"

0:06:46.280,0:06:47.240
"Me."

0:06:47.240,0:06:52.180
"No Delilah destroyed your marriage. You tempted the devil to tempt you."

0:06:52.180,0:06:58.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:58.560,0:07:04.340
By the grace of God, in this particular instance, God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to call the wife.

0:07:04.340,0:07:10.060
She came and after many tears, there was forgiveness and the couple was reconciled together.

0:07:10.060,0:07:11.920
Glory be to God.

0:07:11.920,0:07:14.700
But the story does not end here.

0:07:14.700,0:07:21.020
Six months later thereabout, I was holding one of the Emmanuel TV prayerlines and the phone rang.

0:07:21.020,0:07:24.520
The voice of the person at the other end sounded familiar.

0:07:24.520,0:07:29.140
The brother said, "Please, help me, pray for me. My wife has left".

0:07:29.140,0:07:34.120
I began to know, "Wait a minute. This is the same guy!"

0:07:34.120,0:07:37.460
I asked him a question and his name and I knew it was the same guy.

0:07:37.460,0:07:41.820
The moment he realised that I knew what had happened, he grew silent.

0:07:41.820,0:07:48.180
And I asked him, "Brother, what happened again? The issue was resolved".

0:07:48.180,0:07:50.340
He was silent.

0:07:50.340,0:07:56.480
Until finally, he said, "I met another lady on Facebook".

0:07:56.480,0:08:01.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:01.660,0:08:05.240
People of God, I don't want you to judge that young man

0:08:05.240,0:08:09.020
and I am not here to judge him because no one is perfect.

0:08:09.020,0:08:14.460
I want you to examine your own life.

0:08:14.460,0:08:24.640
Those healed of the punishment of sin are likely to return to sin when the pains are over.

0:08:24.640,0:08:27.740
We all fight these battles.

0:08:27.740,0:08:32.720
The battle we fight in our daily walk is with our flesh, our senses.

0:08:32.720,0:08:35.400
By nature, man is rebellious.

0:08:35.400,0:08:39.780
Man's spirit - if we choose, we would likely choose fleshly desires,

0:08:39.780,0:08:43.480
and satan is looking for any opportunity to strike, to hit,

0:08:43.480,0:08:47.680
to get in and corrupt, and get into our heart.

0:08:47.680,0:08:49.360
He is looking for that chance.

0:08:49.360,0:08:56.900
Anytime you succumb to temptations, fleshly desires, fleshly tendencies,

0:08:56.900,0:09:02.640
satan has a foothold in your heart.

0:09:02.640,0:09:09.500
He gets in, starts his work of stealing, killing destruction, injecting his poison.

0:09:09.500,0:09:19.500
He gets busy at work, eroding your morals, dulling your conscience,

0:09:19.500,0:09:27.480
decaying your values, blurring the lines between the acceptable and abominable.

0:09:27.480,0:09:32.900
Before you know it, satan with a foothold in your heart,

0:09:32.900,0:09:38.320
something you vowed that you would never do, suddenly you think,

0:09:38.320,0:09:42.800
"Maybe, I should just try it once. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad".

0:09:42.800,0:09:48.160
Something that you have eaten before and it was bitter, disgusting, destructive.

0:09:48.160,0:09:54.660
You say, "Maybe if I try it this time, there will be a different result. Let me still try it".

0:09:54.660,0:10:00.920
Something that as a child, you were told, "Don’t go there! Don’t do this; this will destroy you!",

0:10:00.920,0:10:05.500
you say, "Well, maybe they didn’t know. Maybe there is a reason why they told me not to go there.

0:10:05.500,0:10:12.580
Let me just try it out and see for myself. Experience is the best teacher".

0:10:12.580,0:10:16.720
Black and white fade to grey.

0:10:16.720,0:10:18.820
People of God know this.

0:10:18.820,0:10:32.240
When the Word of God is in your heart, it will preserve and protect you from desiring sin.

0:10:32.240,0:10:36.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:36.140,0:10:50.220
When the Word of God is in your heart, it will preserve and protect you from desiring sin.

0:10:50.220,0:10:58.220
This brings us to the title of today's message: DEALING WITH DESIRE.

0:10:58.220,0:11:18.960
Turn with me in your Bible to the proof text which is taken from the Book of James 1:13 - 15.

0:11:18.960,0:11:24.700
We need to deal with desire because prevention is better than cure.

0:11:24.700,0:11:28.360
James 1:13-15:

0:11:28.360,0:11:34.160
"When tempted, no one should say, God is tempting me.

0:11:34.160,0:11:39.180
For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone;

0:11:39.180,0:11:45.180
but each person is tempted when they are dragged away

0:11:45.180,0:12:02.000
by their own evil desire and enticed.

0:12:02.000,0:12:08.740
Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin

0:12:08.740,0:12:18.540
and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."

0:12:18.540,0:12:27.520
Everyone has fleshly desires but do you provide a platform for them in your heart?

0:12:27.520,0:12:30.200
Do you lay a foundation for them to flourish,

0:12:30.200,0:12:35.280
a base for them to bloom in your heart?

0:12:35.280,0:12:39.320
One thing I want to let you know, brethren; it is important we understand this.

0:12:39.320,0:12:46.100
The day you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour,

0:12:46.100,0:12:54.060
the day you make a commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against satan.

0:12:54.060,0:12:56.800
This means war.

0:12:56.800,0:13:03.660
By identifying yourself with Christ, you have made satan your bitter enemy.

0:13:03.660,0:13:11.060
Becoming a Christian is basically making yourself a mark, a target for satan to shoot at.

0:13:11.060,0:13:16.580
He hates you the way he hates Jesus.

0:13:16.580,0:13:18.740
That is the meaning of our Christian journey.

0:13:18.740,0:13:23.680
That is why our journey as Christians, our road to the throne is not a bed of roses.

0:13:23.680,0:13:25.720
It's not just easy; it's not rosy.

0:13:25.720,0:13:33.760
We have loss and gain. We experience ups and downs, highs and lows.

0:13:33.760,0:13:37.140
We experience social, moral and economic uncertainties.

0:13:37.140,0:13:39.380
We harbour internal and external troubles.

0:13:39.380,0:13:48.800
The road to the Kingdom of God is not just a bed of roses because satan is looking for a way to strike.

0:13:48.800,0:13:54.400
Looking for an avenue to hit, to penetrate.

0:13:54.400,0:13:57.020
And God knows this.

0:13:57.020,0:13:58.420
Look at the case of Job.

0:13:58.420,0:14:02.100
With God's permission, you can be tempted.

0:14:02.100,0:14:09.260
Temptation can come in any form, at anytime, from anyone; temptation can come.

0:14:09.260,0:14:11.320
With God's permission, you can be tempted.

0:14:11.320,0:14:15.440
If God is aware of it, if God has knowledge of it, if God allows it,

0:14:15.440,0:14:17.540
you can be tempted just like Job.

0:14:17.540,0:14:20.120
Don't think it strange and doubt your Guard.

0:14:20.120,0:14:25.800
No, you can be attacked but you can never be destroyed.

0:14:25.800,0:14:28.360
I hope you are listening to what I am saying, people of God.

0:14:28.360,0:14:34.600
As a Christian, you can be attacked but you can never be destroyed.

0:14:34.600,0:14:43.180
Satan is never permitted to block our way without the providence of God making a way out.

0:14:43.180,0:14:47.480
If satan today brings iron to block your way,

0:14:47.480,0:14:51.380
look left, look right, look back, look front, you don't see any way out,

0:14:51.380,0:14:56.940
God will bring a welder to cut a way out through the iron.

0:14:56.940,0:14:59.000
1 Corinthians 10:13:

0:14:59.000,0:15:05.320
"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;

0:15:05.320,0:15:11.040
but God is faithful and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear

0:15:11.040,0:15:14.900
but with it, will provide a way out."

0:15:14.900,0:15:22.080
In fact, if we are on God's agenda, in line with God's will, God's Word,

0:15:22.080,0:15:34.160
often the very things that seem an abortion of God's plan are actually the road to it's fulfillment.

0:15:34.160,0:15:40.720
What you look at as the end, with Christ, it will open the door to new beginnings.

0:15:40.720,0:15:51.920
But the problem lies when you step out of your way, out of your duty, out of God’s agenda.

0:15:51.920,0:15:58.320
Then you forfeit His promise and put yourselves out of God’s protection.

0:15:58.320,0:16:00.820
The promise of God that says, "I will be with you.

0:16:00.820,0:16:05.660
Even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil for I will be with you".

0:16:05.660,0:16:09.140
When you step out of God's will, out of God's agenda,

0:16:09.140,0:16:15.600
you forfeit the promise and you are on your own.

0:16:15.600,0:16:18.660
Our natural strength cannot defeat satan in battle.

0:16:18.660,0:16:20.820
When you tempt the devil to tempt you,

0:16:20.820,0:16:27.000
you provoke God to withdraw His strength and leave you to your own strength.

0:16:27.000,0:16:32.300
Tell your neighbour, "Don't tempt the devil to tempt you".

0:16:32.300,0:16:43.300
Now I want to try and use an illustration to gain great understanding of this principle.

0:16:43.300,0:16:49.620
And for this illustration, I need three volunteers, male volunteers.

0:16:49.620,0:16:53.040
Oh, there we go, three straight, Thank you very much, brethren.

0:16:53.040,0:17:00.880
The language I want to use to demonstrate this example is a language that is universal.

0:17:00.880,0:17:03.440
The language of football.

0:17:03.440,0:17:04.940
Where are you from, sir?

0:17:04.940,0:17:06.140
From Lagos.

0:17:06.140,0:17:07.340
Nigeria.

0:17:07.340,0:17:08.940
Akwa Ibom.

0:17:08.940,0:17:10.320
From Spain.

0:17:10.320,0:17:12.620
Wow, we have a bit of a world cup here.

0:17:12.620,0:17:15.200
Now, brother from Spain, if you come with me.

0:17:15.200,0:17:17.600
We are going to split ourselves into two teams.

0:17:17.600,0:17:19.680
Just turn around and face the crowd, sir.

0:17:19.680,0:17:22.380
We are going to split ourselves into two teams.

0:17:22.380,0:17:26.000
This is Team Jesus.

0:17:26.000,0:17:28.900
Here is Team Satan.

0:17:28.900,0:17:33.300
Very sorry, brother; just for now, just for a moment.

0:17:33.300,0:17:42.060
We want to have a very quick exercise that will help illustrate this principle of what it means

0:17:42.060,0:17:44.680
when you tempt the devil to tempt you.

0:17:44.680,0:17:50.540
Ok, so this is our playing ground. This is our ball.

0:17:50.540,0:17:54.180
All of us have played some street football before, especially the men.

0:17:54.180,0:17:58.800
Irrespective of  where you are from - we all know how to play football on the streets.

0:17:58.800,0:18:04.360
Alright, so let's make the goal a little bit bigger, a little bit easier.

0:18:04.360,0:18:07.120
So the aim of this game is very simple.

0:18:07.120,0:18:13.160
I and my brother here - Team Jesus - we want to score in this goal.

0:18:13.160,0:18:17.340
Team Satan wants to score in this goal.

0:18:17.340,0:18:22.380
I think the easiest way to  do this is with a whistle.

0:18:22.380,0:18:24.500
Another rule I forgot to tell you.

0:18:24.500,0:18:28.740
I am playing in this game but I'm also explaining the sermon.

0:18:28.740,0:18:32.680
So any time you hear this whistle, pause.

0:18:32.680,0:18:35.320
Are you ready?

0:18:35.320,0:18:38.160
Crowd, I hope you are going to support Team Jesus.

0:18:38.160,0:18:43.120
If we see people cheering for Team Satan, don't worry - we will pray for you later for your deliverance.

0:18:43.120,0:18:46.180
Come, my brother. Ok. Three, two, one - go.

0:18:46.180,0:18:53.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:53.840,0:19:00.500
Ok, the ball is with Team Satan. Come on, Team Satan, let's see if we can...

0:19:00.500,0:19:02.560
I see skills.

0:19:02.560,0:19:04.760
Ok, no problem.

0:19:04.760,0:19:11.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:11.340,0:19:15.040
We got the ball again.

0:19:15.040,0:19:17.260
Oh, look at that. Come on!

0:19:17.260,0:19:18.660
Yes!

0:19:18.660,0:19:20.000
Goal!

0:19:20.000,0:19:22.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:22.600,0:19:25.280
Brilliant! Alright.

0:19:25.280,0:19:27.960
Don't worry, the example is still coming. We have to score a goal first.

0:19:27.960,0:19:30.880
1:0 Team Jesus. Ok, come on then guys, let's go.

0:19:30.880,0:19:41.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:41.240,0:19:43.780
Yeah, this guy is good.

0:19:43.780,0:19:47.480
Ok, now watch this.

0:19:47.480,0:19:49.480
Hold on.

0:19:49.480,0:19:53.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:53.000,0:19:57.560
What just happened?

0:19:57.560,0:20:05.360
Team Satan is my enemy, my adversary, my opponent but I just gave him the ball.

0:20:05.360,0:20:09.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:09.300,0:20:14.120
I just gave him the ball. We are on the opposite side.

0:20:14.120,0:20:20.220
I gave him the ball and don't be surprised if he strikes.

0:20:20.220,0:20:24.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:24.080,0:20:29.420
He scored! Why did Team Satan score?

0:20:29.420,0:20:33.360
Why?

0:20:33.360,0:20:43.960
Why do you complain when satan strikes when you are the one that gives him the ball?

0:20:43.960,0:20:53.920
Each time you go where Jesus is not welcomed, you give him the ball.

0:20:53.920,0:21:01.480
Each time you listen to what you know is corruptive and destructive to your spirit,

0:21:01.480,0:21:05.740
you give him the ball.

0:21:05.740,0:21:11.020
Each time you as a married man ask for a phone number from that lady you met,

0:21:11.020,0:21:16.300
you give him the ball.

0:21:16.300,0:21:23.140
Each time you are on your computer, your laptop, your phone and a pornographic advert comes up,

0:21:23.140,0:21:29.000
which says, "Click here to see more" and you look to your left, look to your right and click,

0:21:29.000,0:21:37.160
you give him the ball.

0:21:37.160,0:21:41.460
Each time you put a password on your phone that even your wife doesn't know

0:21:41.460,0:21:46.180
because what you are doing on there, you don't even want your own wife to know what you are doing,

0:21:46.180,0:21:49.380
you give satan the ball.

0:21:49.380,0:21:54.120
Don't be surprised when he strikes.

0:21:54.120,0:21:59.820
Don't be surprised if he scores because he is a very good attacker.

0:21:59.820,0:22:05.060
He is a very good striker.

0:22:05.060,0:22:14.900
Don't tempt the devil to tempt you.

0:22:14.900,0:22:20.460
Do you know what we as people of God are supposed to do? I will tell you what.

0:22:20.460,0:22:24.580
We are not even supposed to be playing games with Team Satan.

0:22:24.580,0:22:27.920
We are children of God - what is our business with them?

0:22:27.920,0:22:34.160
When we see that they have come into our heart, do you know what you are supposed to do?

0:22:34.160,0:22:38.260
Out! Go!

0:22:38.260,0:22:40.840
Send them out.

0:22:40.840,0:22:44.020
Give them a red card. Send him out.

0:22:44.020,0:22:45.880
You have no business with him.

0:22:45.880,0:22:53.780
When you send him out of the way, there is no way -  you can score.

0:22:53.780,0:22:59.440
But today, many of us, what we do, we give satan just a yellow card.

0:22:59.440,0:23:03.560
"I will give you another chance, satan. I will give you a warning. Let's try again."

0:23:03.560,0:23:10.140
You give him a yellow card, instead of you to take your position in the believer's authority,

0:23:10.140,0:23:15.720
'You satan, you have no business in my life, my family, my marriage, my career. Get out!"

0:23:15.720,0:23:22.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:22.460,0:23:25.640
It was a good game so we have to compensate our brethren.

0:23:25.640,0:23:28.340
I think Team Jesus won 2:1.

0:23:28.340,0:23:34.240
Please come and take an altar fruit as a blessing for your life.

0:23:34.240,0:23:37.080
We will not give you a red card on the altar. Don't worry.

0:23:37.080,0:23:44.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:44.040,0:23:54.280
No mortal man or devil can supersede the plan of God for your life.

0:23:54.280,0:24:08.020
There is only one person who can get you out of the will of God -  and that is you.

0:24:08.020,0:24:10.540
That is you.

0:24:10.540,0:24:14.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:14.640,0:24:21.060
One of the greatest gifts God has given us is the freedom to make decisions.

0:24:21.060,0:24:24.520
All of us who have fallen made a decision

0:24:24.520,0:24:31.900
and all of us who have not fallen faced a similar temptation and made a different decision.

0:24:31.900,0:24:36.100
It is not our challenges, temptations, troubles that make us fall;

0:24:36.100,0:24:39.180
it is our reaction to them.

0:24:39.180,0:24:43.100
While some of us yield to the pressure and make wrong decisions,

0:24:43.100,0:24:46.880
others face the same pressure and make the right decisions.

0:24:46.880,0:24:56.380
Whoever you yield yourself to obey, that is whose servant you are.

0:24:56.380,0:25:00.320
Romans 6:16.

0:25:00.320,0:25:07.300
Brethren, our heart is a treasury.

0:25:07.300,0:25:16.620
Luke 6:45 says that a good man brings forth good things out of the good that is stored up in his heart

0:25:16.620,0:25:24.800
but an evil man brings forth evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.

0:25:24.800,0:25:28.960
What are you storing up in your heart?

0:25:28.960,0:25:36.780
Pride or humility?
Love or hatred?

0:25:36.780,0:25:41.480
Offence or forgiveness?

0:25:41.480,0:25:47.320
What you store up in your heart will be revealed at the point of temptation.

0:25:47.320,0:25:50.280
Temptation provokes what you are hiding, what you are storing.

0:25:50.280,0:25:54.240
What you have been keeping in your heart provokes that temptation.

0:25:54.240,0:25:58.340
That your weakness comes out in the face of temptation.

0:25:58.340,0:26:00.880
What you have been keeping, hiding, harbouring in your heart.

0:26:00.880,0:26:04.400
Look at Judas Iscariot in the Bible - the betrayer.

0:26:04.400,0:26:07.120
Judas Iscariot  lived and walked with Jesus

0:26:07.120,0:26:12.380
He was one of the twelve that Jesus sent out to heal the sick and deliver the demon-possessed.

0:26:12.380,0:26:17.060
He heard the teachings, he saw the miracles, he lived with Jesus.

0:26:17.060,0:26:25.300
But the Bible says in John 12:4-6 that Judas Iscariot harboured the secret sin of stealing.

0:26:25.300,0:26:30.240
He took from the money bag when no one was looking.

0:26:30.240,0:26:35.400
What he harboured in his heart gave satan a foothold to enter

0:26:35.400,0:26:41.000
and manipulate him to the point of betraying the Son of God.

0:26:41.000,0:26:43.920
Cain - you know the story of Cain and Abel in the Bible.

0:26:43.920,0:26:47.920
Let's quickly turn there; turn to the Book of Genesis.

0:26:47.920,0:26:54.200
Genesis 4:7.

0:26:54.200,0:26:58.960
You know, Cain gave an unworthy offering -

0:26:58.960,0:27:02.220
an offering to honour himself and dishonour God.

0:27:02.220,0:27:06.260
God was not happy; God told him in that Genesis 4:7,

0:27:06.260,0:27:09.380
"If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?

0:27:09.380,0:27:21.740
But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door;

0:27:21.740,0:27:26.100
it desires to have you but you must rule over it."

0:27:26.100,0:27:32.440
Even with this warning from God, because Cain bore a grudge against his brother Abel,

0:27:32.440,0:27:35.780
because God accepted Abel's offering,

0:27:35.780,0:27:44.540
satan had a foothold in his heart and manipulated him to the point of murdering his own brother.

0:27:44.540,0:27:48.020
On the contrary, Joseph - we know the story of Joseph.

0:27:48.020,0:27:54.060
Do you know the reason why Joseph did not succumb to the temptation from Potiphar's wife?

0:27:54.060,0:27:58.960
Potiphar's wife was trying to seduce Joseph, wanted to sleep with him at all cost.

0:27:58.960,0:28:04.200
Do you know the reason why Joseph did not give in or yield or submit to that temptation?

0:28:04.200,0:28:11.720
He knew who he was; he was a child with a promise of God.

0:28:11.720,0:28:16.840
I tell you today - you are children of promise.

0:28:16.840,0:28:19.680
You are children of destiny.

0:28:19.680,0:28:23.080
You are children with a promise from God.

0:28:23.080,0:28:31.100
Your destiny does not permit you to give your heart to fleshly desires.

0:28:31.100,0:28:40.000
Your destiny, your promise from God is too precious to be corrupted, tainted, perverted.

0:28:40.000,0:28:42.660
Your destiny does not permit you.

0:28:42.660,0:28:45.120
Consider your destiny.

0:28:45.120,0:28:59.180
Your destiny does not allow you to waste time on things that have no lasting value and significance.

0:28:59.180,0:29:06.220
Your destiny does not permit you to strive and struggle against flesh and blood.

0:29:06.220,0:29:10.300
Consider your destiny.

0:29:10.300,0:29:12.740
Be God conscious.

0:29:12.740,0:29:15.780
Cultivate a consciousness of God.

0:29:15.780,0:29:19.920
If you are conscious of God, your heart will not rest until it rests in Him.

0:29:19.920,0:29:23.880
You go where Jesus will not be welcomed -

0:29:23.880,0:29:27.600
your spirit will be agitated until you leave that place.

0:29:27.600,0:29:31.860
You have a conversation with someone and you sense a satanic influence - you will quickly cut it off.

0:29:31.860,0:29:39.260
But today, the problem is that satan's traps for us are often hidden.

0:29:39.260,0:29:45.060
He would disguise himself as an angel of light and come with his hidden agenda.

0:29:45.060,0:29:49.880
It takes the grace, the strength of one grounded in the Word of God,

0:29:49.880,0:29:56.560
to be able to identify the devil's tricks for what they are.

0:29:56.560,0:29:59.380
If you ask any man here, "Will you sleep with a snake?",

0:29:59.380,0:30:02.180
he will say, "No, over my dead body!"

0:30:02.180,0:30:07.980
Satan knows that so he will put a spirit of snake inside a beautiful lady.

0:30:07.980,0:30:13.520
By the time you meet them, it's not just your bodies that meet; it's your spirits.

0:30:13.520,0:30:18.480
No physical protection can withstand spiritual contamination.

0:30:18.480,0:30:25.460
Many destinies have been diverted, many homes broken, many lives shattered

0:30:25.460,0:30:28.480
because we've given our hearts away to fleshly desires.

0:30:28.480,0:30:32.600
I'm coming to a conclusion, brethren, but I want to tell you something that happened to me;

0:30:32.600,0:30:37.440
how God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to preserve my life.

0:30:37.440,0:30:42.640
When I came here to The SCOAN as a visitor, many many years ago;

0:30:42.640,0:30:46.200
I was in the prayer line, I was about 14-15 years old.

0:30:46.200,0:30:50.320
Prophet T.B. Joshua walked up to me and gave me a word of prophecy.

0:30:50.320,0:30:58.580
He walked up, looked at me and said," Young man, there is a lady that you are close to,

0:30:58.580,0:31:03.820
and you have to be very careful because she is demon-possessed".

0:31:03.820,0:31:06.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:06.940,0:31:08.460
I didn't do that on the outside.

0:31:08.460,0:31:11.480
You know when you receive a prophecy, you say, "Yes, Man of God, it's true".

0:31:11.480,0:31:18.080
But within me, I was like, "Ah! What? There is a lady close to me that is possessed?"

0:31:18.080,0:31:22.860
In fact, I began to think, "Maybe it is this one. Oh my God, what is happening?"

0:31:22.860,0:31:25.400
You should have seen me when I got back to UK.

0:31:25.400,0:31:30.920
If a lady came close to me, "Be gone from me, you satan!"

0:31:30.920,0:31:35.900
I quickly gave her the red card because I was so scared that someone would come.

0:31:35.900,0:31:39.620
This is Prophet T.B. Joshua who had told me; I didn't know who the person was.

0:31:39.620,0:31:49.040
But that prophecy preserved me from making a stupid mistake.

0:31:49.040,0:31:52.080
As a young man, you know the temptations that we face -

0:31:52.080,0:31:55.100
peer pressure, temptations up and down, here and there.

0:31:55.100,0:31:59.660
Anytime this temptation would come, I would remember what the Prophet had told me,

0:31:59.660,0:32:03.420
"There is a lady that is close to you. She is demon-possessed".

0:32:03.420,0:32:07.580
"Ay! Ok, I’m gone! Goodbye. Thank you."

0:32:07.580,0:32:11.720
Leave the place just like Joseph. Get out.

0:32:11.720,0:32:15.560
When Joseph was tempted, he didn't just stay there; he got out.

0:32:15.560,0:32:23.300
Tell your neighbour, "Get out before sin gets in".

0:32:23.300,0:32:38.000
If you ask Samson, he will tell you -  a night of pleasure is not worth a lifetime of blindness.

0:32:38.000,0:32:40.400
In conclusion, brethren:

0:32:40.400,0:32:47.140
The truth of this sermon is enough to change your life.

0:32:47.140,0:32:54.860
But don't just listen to this sermon; study the sermon of your own life.

0:32:54.860,0:33:00.980
Your life experience will testify to this truth.

0:33:00.980,0:33:06.040
Poison is poison, irrespective of how it is packaged.

0:33:06.040,0:33:11.100
Please, don't tempt the devil to tempt you.

0:33:11.100,0:33:14.240
Life already has enough challenges.

0:33:14.240,0:33:17.500
You are a Christian; you have declared war against satan.

0:33:17.500,0:33:21.840
There are already enough challenges in life for you to create one for yourself -

0:33:21.840,0:33:28.620
to create your own trouble, challenge, temptation.

0:33:28.620,0:33:32.940
Jesus said to His disciples, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:33:32.940,0:33:37.100
It means He knew situations would come that would test them, tempt them

0:33:37.100,0:33:39.000
and try to remove them from their faith

0:33:39.000,0:33:43.540
but He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:33:43.540,0:33:48.320
This means, our faith may fail but not fall off.

0:33:48.320,0:33:56.380
If faith is kept up in the hour of temptation, though we are cast down, we will not be utterly destroyed.

0:33:56.380,0:34:04.600
And if God allows it, it will not lead to our end, to our downfall.

0:34:04.600,0:34:07.220
It will lead to our promotion.

0:34:07.220,0:34:12.740
Just stay in line with the will of God.

0:34:12.740,0:34:17.680
And He is there to see you through whatever life brings.

0:34:17.680,0:34:26.460
May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
