- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

0:00:04.300,0:00:08.840
Happy birthday.

0:00:08.840,0:00:12.620
Thank you. While you are sitting down, 
you can say to the Lord,

0:00:12.620,0:00:42.780
“Lord Jesus, You are the Author of my faith. 
Today, I need my faith to act.

0:00:42.780,0:00:48.220
Help my words and my thoughts”.

0:00:48.220,0:00:54.100
Bow down your heads, "I need my faith".

0:00:54.100,0:00:56.540
He is the Author of your faith.

0:00:56.540,0:01:03.520
You need your faith right now to act.

0:01:03.520,0:01:09.340
Help me – help my words and my thoughts.

0:01:09.340,0:01:14.460
You are the Author of my faith.

0:01:14.460,0:01:21.700
Lord Jesus, I need my faith now to act.

0:01:21.700,0:01:27.720
Help my words and my thoughts,
 in Jesus Christ’s name.

0:01:27.720,0:01:29.540
Yes.

0:01:29.540,0:01:32.080
- Hallelujah. 
- Amen.

0:01:32.080,0:01:50.760
Let’s take a look at the Book of Colossians, the Book of John, the Book of Acts and the Book of Ephesians.

0:01:50.760,0:02:03.400
We will take our first reading from the
 Book of Colossians 3, verse 16.

0:02:03.400,0:02:16.320
“Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly…”

0:02:16.320,0:02:19.320
That is abundantly.

0:02:19.320,0:02:24.680
That is our proof text, but read
 from the beginning of that Book.

0:02:24.680,0:02:33.120
“Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, 
set your hearts on things above..."

0:02:33.120,0:02:39.100
Like I have told you, "Set your heart on things above".

0:02:39.100,0:02:46.780
"... where Christ is, seated at the right hand
 of God.” - Colossians 3:1

0:02:46.780,0:02:51.420
Take a look at the verse 16,

0:02:51.420,0:03:03.540
“Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly 
as you teach and admonish one another

0:03:03.540,0:03:13.720
with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, 
and songs from the Spirit…” - Colossians 3:16

0:03:13.720,0:03:16.020
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

0:03:16.020,0:03:22.480
The Book of Ephesians 3:17.

0:03:22.480,0:03:27.780
“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith…”

0:03:27.780,0:03:32.480
It means through faith, Christ can dwell in your heart.

0:03:32.480,0:03:35.460
Christ dwells in my heart through faith.

0:03:35.460,0:03:36.800
Hallelujah.

0:03:36.800,0:03:38.780
Take your reading from the beginning.

0:03:38.780,0:03:41.400
I’m giving you the proof text.

0:03:41.400,0:03:48.940
Let's go to the Book of John 15, verse 7.

0:03:48.940,0:03:53.460
“If you remain in me and my words remain in you,

0:03:53.460,0:04:01.280
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.”

0:04:01.280,0:04:10.860
When you take your time to read that
 Book of Ephesians 3:17, and Colossians 3:16,

0:04:10.860,0:04:22.580
and the Book of Acts 20:32, you will agree 
with me that Christ and the Word are One.

0:04:22.580,0:04:29.220
Jesus Christ and the Word are One.

0:04:29.220,0:04:33.520
The Book of John 15:7 says,

0:04:33.520,0:04:49.460
“If you dwell in Me and My Word dwells in
 you, ask whatsoever and it shall be done”.

0:04:49.460,0:04:54.440
If Christ dwells in you and His
 Word dwells in you; can you see?

0:04:54.440,0:04:57.840
Christ and the Word are One.

0:04:57.840,0:05:01.500
In Ephesians you will find the same; it says that

0:05:01.500,0:05:09.140
Christ can only live in you through faith, 
live in your heart through faith.

0:05:09.140,0:05:11.880
Our heart is of faith.

0:05:11.880,0:05:16.100
Man’s heart is of faith, not man’s mind.

0:05:16.100,0:05:23.880
When you say "Heart", you mean your Spirit - Biblical.

0:05:23.880,0:05:33.780
In this way, it  is the Word dominating us 
that produces prayer fruits – that is, result.

0:05:33.780,0:05:39.260
You say, "In the name of Jesus..." - what are you saying?

0:05:39.260,0:05:43.040
Are you saying this with all your heart?

0:05:43.040,0:05:46.160
Because saying, "In the name of Jesus..."...

0:05:46.160,0:05:50.400
We know Christ through His Word.

0:05:50.400,0:05:57.520
We know Him through the Word.

0:05:57.520,0:06:01.780
"In the name of Jesus. In the blood of Jesus. In the name of Jesus...";

0:06:01.780,0:06:03.320
what are you saying?

0:06:03.320,0:06:09.460
Are you with all your heart, you mean it?

0:06:09.460,0:06:25.140
It is the Word dominating us that 
produces the prayer fruit, result -

0:06:25.140,0:06:36.940
not the Word committed to memory
 which is of course valuable in itself

0:06:36.940,0:06:41.940
but cannot produce prayer fruits.

0:06:41.940,0:06:45.680
But cannot do what?

0:06:45.680,0:06:50.500
It cannot produce prayer fruits.

0:06:50.500,0:06:54.440
How can the Word dwell in our hearts?

0:06:54.440,0:07:02.480
The Word dwells in our hearts when 
we read it slowly, attentively and repeatedly

0:07:02.480,0:07:08.260
without holding grudges.

0:07:08.260,0:07:12.340
You say, "How will I read... ?"

0:07:12.340,0:07:19.500
If I hold grudges towards any 
of my neighbors anywhere,

0:07:19.500,0:07:33.080
I should not be surprised that the Word is no longer real to me while talking, preaching, reading.

0:07:33.080,0:07:42.120
If the Word is no longer real to me, "In the name of Jesus" - I'm talking to myself; it is no real.

0:07:42.120,0:07:47.420
"Be healed!" - I'm talking of myself,
 because it is no longer real.

0:07:47.420,0:07:51.340
So, in the same way you do.

0:07:51.340,0:08:07.360
If I hold grudges, I should not be surprised
 to see that the Word is no longer real to me

0:08:07.360,0:08:17.060
when reading, preaching, talking, praying.

0:08:17.060,0:08:20.920
Can you see the challenges we are facing?

0:08:20.920,0:08:39.080
Committing the Word to memory is of course
 valuable in itself but cannot produce prayer fruits;

0:08:39.080,0:08:41.960
they cannot produce result.

0:08:41.960,0:08:46.940
We know Christ through the Word.

0:08:46.940,0:08:56.440
Through the Word, we know Jesus Christ.

0:08:56.440,0:09:05.240
It is the Word that has taught 
us the value of the name, Jesus,

0:09:05.240,0:09:12.660
the authority of the name and
 our legal right to the use of the name.

0:09:12.660,0:09:16.020
It is the Word - the Word of God.

0:09:16.020,0:09:18.900
Our legal right to the use of the name.

0:09:18.900,0:09:22.800
Nobody will challenge you when you say, 
"In the name of Jesus" - nobody will accuse you,

0:09:22.800,0:09:33.640
but the legal right to use the name by the 
power of Holy Ghost - it is the Word that taught us.

0:09:33.640,0:09:36.100
How can the Word dwell in us?

0:09:36.100,0:09:41.820
The Word dwells in us when we read it 
slowly, attentively and repeatedly

0:09:41.820,0:09:50.840
without holding grudges.

0:09:50.840,0:10:00.740
How many of us here are free 
from grudges, pain of the past?

0:10:00.740,0:10:04.140
“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”

0:10:04.140,0:10:05.940
That is what the Bible is saying.

0:10:05.940,0:10:11.900
When you read the Bible, you hear from God.

0:10:11.900,0:10:15.300
“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”

0:10:15.300,0:10:20.240
Whether wrongly or rightly; in whatever way.

0:10:20.240,0:10:25.380
And you are carrying the Bible to read.

0:10:25.380,0:10:30.640
The Word dominating us is the Lordship of Christ in us.

0:10:30.640,0:10:34.020
A good example: “Be healed, in the name of Jesus!”

0:10:34.020,0:10:36.180
“In the name of Jesus, be delivered!”

0:10:36.180,0:10:38.360
“In the name of Jesus, be set free!”

0:10:38.360,0:10:44.080
It is the Word dominating us that
 brings Jesus to the scene

0:10:44.080,0:10:50.720
and instantly, healing takes place.

0:10:50.720,0:10:57.020
It is the Word dwelling in us that
 brings Jesus to the scene.

0:10:57.020,0:11:01.220
"Jesus!", and He will come.

0:11:01.220,0:11:11.980
It is the Word dominating us, dwelling in us, 
living in us that brings Jesus to the scene.

0:11:11.980,0:11:17.160
Now, you know where your challenges come from.

0:11:17.160,0:11:22.100
Though, you have the Bible, the name 
"Jesus" you know how to call,

0:11:22.100,0:11:29.060
but it seems that name is not giving the result.

0:11:29.060,0:11:36.680
Listen, we know Jesus Christ through the Word.

0:11:36.680,0:11:41.800
Without the Word is without Jesus Christ.

0:11:41.800,0:11:45.620
Has the Word ruled us?

0:11:45.620,0:11:56.600
Jesus is building Himself into us 
and making Himself a part of us.

0:11:56.600,0:12:01.560
Tell your neighbour, “Is the Word dominating us?”

0:12:01.560,0:12:05.840
I mean, is the Word dwelling in us?

0:12:05.840,0:12:08.520
Is the Word living in us?

0:12:08.520,0:12:11.740
Is the Word ruling us?

0:12:11.740,0:12:25.140
Jesus is building Himself in us and 
making Himself a part of us.

0:12:25.140,0:12:33.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:33.080,0:12:45.460
The more you meditate, the more 
your spirit acts upon the Word

0:12:45.460,0:12:52.760
and the more the Word becomes part of you.

0:12:52.760,0:13:10.220
The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible, 
the more your spirit acts upon the Word,

0:13:10.220,0:13:18.100
or you say the more your heart - it is the 
same as your spirit acts upon the Word,

0:13:18.100,0:13:23.820
and the more the Word becomes part of you.

0:13:23.820,0:13:26.740
When the Word becomes part of you, 
you can make use of it.

0:13:26.740,0:13:29.760
Then, you can say, “In the name of Jesus, be free!”

0:13:29.760,0:13:33.980
And if there is freedom, it means 
that the Word has become part of you.

0:13:33.980,0:13:38.100
When the Word becomes part of you,
 you can say, “Jesus!”

0:13:38.100,0:13:44.720
When you sleep and there is a nightmare or an attack in the dream, some people come to attack you,

0:13:44.720,0:13:49.640
you say, "Jesus!" and you see them bow,

0:13:49.640,0:13:57.800
instead of when you see people in the dream,
 coming to attack you, you say, "Honey, honey..."

0:13:57.800,0:14:01.540
How can honey become Jesus?

0:14:01.540,0:14:06.520
"Honey, honey...", it will not say,
 "What is happening, my dear?"

0:14:06.520,0:14:10.600
Is that not what has happened to you?

0:14:10.600,0:14:17.440
People come with gun to attack you, 
you say, "... Honey, honey..."

0:14:17.440,0:14:22.400
Honey will not say, "My dear,
 what happened, in Jesus name?"

0:14:22.400,0:14:26.480
And they have attacked you already
 before you called that name.

0:14:26.480,0:14:34.600
They have attacked you because the 
Word has not become part of you.

0:14:34.600,0:14:37.720
Has the Word dominated us?

0:14:37.720,0:14:41.960
Is the Word living in us?

0:14:41.960,0:14:52.880
Jesus is building Himself in us, 
making Himself a part of us.

0:14:52.880,0:14:55.320
The Word has not yet dominated you.

0:14:55.320,0:15:00.480
It has not yet dwelt in you.

0:15:00.480,0:15:02.500
You can have the knowledge of the Bible -

0:15:02.500,0:15:12.480
you read, memorize and use it to preach, teach, lecture

0:15:12.480,0:15:20.220
but living by it, it must dwell in you.

0:15:20.220,0:15:24.960
Don't forget those passages and Books given to you.

0:15:24.960,0:15:32.000
Take your time to read the
 Book of Ephesians 3, from verse 17,

0:15:32.000,0:15:37.660
the Book of John 15; take reading from verse 7,

0:15:37.660,0:15:42.880
the Book of Acts 20; take reading from verse 32,

0:15:42.880,0:15:49.340
the Book of Colossians 3;
 take your reading from verse 16.

0:15:49.340,0:15:59.080
You cannot build one up spiritually.

0:15:59.080,0:16:04.940
Because, today this is what is happening
 all over today, everywhere.

0:16:04.940,0:16:10.140
Church has become an entertainment.

0:16:10.140,0:16:20.380
We cannot build people up spiritually
 on the theory about the Book,

0:16:20.380,0:16:23.740
on the history or philosophy.

0:16:23.740,0:16:32.720
"Jesus is this. The mother is here. The father is this. 
The Son is this. He was born in the manger..."

0:16:32.720,0:16:44.440
You cannot be built up spiritually on the history of the Book, the theory about the Book

0:16:44.440,0:16:49.840
or philosophy of the Book.

0:16:49.840,0:16:56.240
The Word must dominate, live in us.

0:16:56.240,0:17:06.420
Building can only come from the heart;
 it is what comes from our heart that can build.

0:17:06.420,0:17:08.680
Don't forget at the beginning I said,

0:17:08.680,0:17:23.840
if I hold grudges, I should not be surprised 
to see that the Bible is no longer real to me

0:17:23.840,0:17:29.640
when talking, reading, preaching.

0:17:29.640,0:17:37.120
See what is going on in churches today; 
there is so much division - that is grudges.

0:17:37.120,0:17:42.480
This is why the Bible is no longer real to us,
 because of so much division.

0:17:42.480,0:17:46.920
"This one is not good. That one is not good."
 - fight everywhere in the churches.

0:17:46.920,0:17:49.980
The churches are no longer one.

0:17:49.980,0:17:54.620
This is why the Bible is no longer real to us.

0:17:54.620,0:17:57.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:57.660,0:18:01.460
We are no longer one.

0:18:01.460,0:18:03.000
Fight.

0:18:03.000,0:18:09.080
Many of us are here today without the permission, because if you tried to collect permission,

0:18:09.080,0:18:11.540
they would not allow you to come.

0:18:11.540,0:18:16.740
Many are sitting at the back; each
 time the camera is coming they dodge,

0:18:16.740,0:18:21.120
because they don't want their mentor to see them.

0:18:21.120,0:18:23.760
Each time the camera comes...

0:18:23.760,0:18:28.760
Some even put on very dark shade.

0:18:28.760,0:18:31.980
Each time camera comes they bow.

0:18:31.980,0:18:37.900
Instead of bowing to Jesus they bow to camera.

0:18:37.900,0:18:43.620
When it is mass prayer, instead of facing
 on front, they turn back, "In Jesus name";

0:18:43.620,0:18:47.600
as if Holy Spirit is the one turning them.

0:18:47.600,0:18:55.860
... because you cannot bear the 
consequence, after leaving here.

0:18:55.860,0:19:04.840
They will chase you out of your business, 
your house - because they are your bread.

0:19:04.840,0:19:13.960
This is why the Bible is no longer real to us, 
because there is division.

0:19:13.960,0:19:16.400
I want to leave you here.

0:19:16.400,0:19:20.160
I don't want you to have too much to think about.

0:19:20.160,0:19:27.860
I want you to have so much to meditate 
about, not to think about.
