0:00:00.000,0:00:02.540
Hallelujah!

0:00:02.540,0:00:05.920
Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel".

0:00:05.920,0:00:07.080
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:00:07.080,0:00:11.120
Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".

0:00:11.120,0:00:15.100
Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".

0:00:15.100,0:00:19.580
Give your neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".

0:00:19.580,0:00:23.960
Give your neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".

0:00:23.960,0:00:34.700
Greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"

0:00:34.700,0:00:40.300
God is with us.

0:00:40.300,0:00:54.940
Whilst we are still standing, please join me and thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

There are no words that can describe what God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:11.840,0:01:17.340
not only to do in my life but to do in this generation.

Blessed are our eyes for seeing what we have seen

0:01:29.820,0:01:35.420
and blessed are our ears for hearing what we have heard.

My name is Chris,

0:01:59.980,0:02:06.340
and by the special grace of God, I have the opportunity today to share with you

0:02:06.340,0:02:10.060
the sweet story of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

0:02:10.060,0:02:18.180
It is the greatest privilege on earth to be able to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ

0:02:18.180,0:02:23.380
to all of you and all the viewers on Emmanuel TV.

0:02:23.380,0:02:28.960
Last week, we received a very wonderful message from Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:02:28.960,0:02:32.580
which was titled, ‘The Greatest Achievement On Earth’.

0:02:32.580,0:02:36.940
Now, who can remind me: What is the greatest achievement on earth?

0:02:36.940,0:02:40.480
I hope you have been watching the sermon on Emmanuel TV.

0:02:40.480,0:02:43.160
What is the greatest achievement on earth?

0:02:43.160,0:02:47.740
If someone can remind me of what Prophet T.B. Joshua said last week?

0:02:47.740,0:02:53.240
Remember; it is not in terms of material possessions, wealth, position - no.

0:02:53.240,0:02:56.060
What is the greatest achievement here on earth?

0:02:56.060,0:02:57.180
Can anyone remind me?

0:02:57.180,0:02:57.760
OK.

0:02:57.760,0:03:01.100
Good morning, Church.

0:03:01.100,0:03:10.400
Last week we heard that the greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants us to pray.

0:03:10.400,0:03:11.260
Amen.

0:03:11.260,0:03:14.900
Amen; let's put our hands together for our sister.

0:03:14.900,0:03:16.760
Yes, that is the greatest achievement on earth.

0:03:16.760,0:03:21.220
We are not just talking about the prayer of the lips.

0:03:21.220,0:03:24.540
We are talking about the prayer of the heart

0:03:24.540,0:03:29.900
because the heart of prayer is prayer from the heart.

0:03:29.900,0:03:39.220
Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, the heart of prayer is prayer from the heart".

0:03:39.220,0:03:42.300
We are going to talk about the heart today – the ‘man himself’.

0:03:42.300,0:03:45.360
Tell you neighbour, "The man himself".

0:03:45.360,0:03:50.420
That is the real you, the true you – the heart.

0:03:50.420,0:03:57.440
We are going to talk about the need for us to take care of our hearts.

0:03:57.440,0:04:09.320
Tell your neighbour, "Take care of your heart".

0:04:09.320,0:04:12.940
We know, as 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says that

0:04:12.940,0:04:19.980
man is a divine being possessed of spirit, soul and body.

0:04:19.980,0:04:28.060
In other words, you are a spirit living in the physical body, learning to live in the natural world.

0:04:28.060,0:04:31.320
Tell your neighbour, "I am a spirit".

0:04:31.320,0:04:36.060
The real thing about you is your spirit, is your heart.

0:04:36.060,0:04:37.560
That is the real thing about you.

0:04:37.560,0:04:44.240
That is the communication point for God, the contact point, the landing point,

0:04:44.240,0:04:50.100
the strong room, the powerhouse – the heart.

0:04:50.100,0:04:55.420
Tell your neighbour, “Take care of your heart”.

0:04:55.420,0:04:58.820
We also read in John 4:24 that

0:04:58.820,0:05:10.320
God Himself is Spirit and those who worship Him must do so in Spirit and in truth.

0:05:10.320,0:05:12.220
What does this mean?

0:05:12.220,0:05:29.220
If we do not worship God who is a Spirit, in the Spirit, we miss the end of worship.

0:05:29.220,0:05:31.240
We miss the point.

0:05:31.240,0:05:39.340
If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing – in vain.

0:05:39.340,0:05:44.340
This is what happens when your church service turns into a ceremony.

0:05:44.340,0:05:48.780
You know the time the service begins, you know the time the service ends,

0:05:48.780,0:05:56.020
you know the pre-planned program for the day, who will preach the title of the sermon for the next four weeks,

0:05:56.020,0:06:00.300
because the Holy Spirit is not the one releasing the words.

0:06:00.300,0:06:03.100
If the Holy Spirit does not release the words,

0:06:03.100,0:06:07.560
you may speak the truth but you are just speaking today’s language.

0:06:07.560,0:06:12.380
That truth cannot penetrate the hearts.

0:06:12.380,0:06:20.340
It can strike the ear, but not ring in the conscience.

0:06:20.340,0:06:27.820
Until today’s church realises that the spirit of man, the heart of man

0:06:27.820,0:06:39.300
is the fountain of faith, only then will the Holy Spirit begin to be involved in our affairs.

0:06:39.300,0:06:41.920
God is Spirit; you too are spirit.

0:06:41.920,0:06:43.820
The Word of God is Spirit.

0:06:43.820,0:06:50.080
So for you to have a relationship with Him, it must be in the Spirit, in the heart.

0:06:50.080,0:06:55.400
Tell your neighbour, “Take care of your heart”.

0:06:55.400,0:07:05.720
Let's turn to our proof text for today's message, which is the Book of Matthew 23.

0:07:05.720,0:07:12.880
I will read from verse 1; the main text we will be going to is from verses 25-27.

0:07:12.880,0:07:14.720
So, verse 1:

0:07:14.720,0:07:19.380
“Then Jesus said to the crowds and to His disciples:

0:07:19.380,0:07:25.700
‘The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.

0:07:25.700,0:07:29.500
So you must be careful to do everything they tell you.

0:07:29.500,0:07:38.760
But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.’”

0:07:38.760,0:07:41.180
Now, let's move to verse 25.

0:07:41.180,0:07:45.000
Remember, this is our Lord, Jesus Christ speaking to His people.

0:07:45.000,0:07:46.920
Verse 25:

0:07:46.920,0:07:56.380
“’Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

0:07:56.380,0:08:10.500
You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.

0:08:10.500,0:08:24.420
Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean.'"

0:08:24.420,0:08:26.120
Verse 27:

0:08:26.120,0:08:31.900
“’Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

0:08:31.900,0:08:41.300
You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside

0:08:41.300,0:08:52.400
but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.’”

0:08:52.400,0:08:59.340
Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, take care of your heart".

0:08:59.340,0:09:07.540
Jesus was describing a situation where someone cares for their flesh,

0:09:07.540,0:09:14.680
their appearance, their external and neglect their heart -

0:09:14.680,0:09:20.620
the real you, the true you – the ‘man himself’.

0:09:20.620,0:09:28.240
Now, I want to try to use an example, based on the Scripture that may relate to us in a more clear-cut way.

0:09:28.240,0:09:37.740
Just imagine; you have had a long day at work, you have worked hard, tirelessly,

0:09:37.740,0:09:43.220
and you are coming home to eat, and you know that your favourite food has been prepared.

0:09:43.220,0:09:48.180
And when you get back to your home, you see the food prepared...

0:09:48.180,0:09:54.180
You are tired, stressed, you have had a long day, you are hungry and you see a beautiful plate of food,

0:09:54.180,0:09:59.180
beautifully presented, looking wonderful, beautifully prepared.

0:09:59.180,0:10:00.440
Let me just ask someone.

0:10:00.440,0:10:03.760
Sir, what is your favourite food?

0:10:03.760,0:10:05.260
Pap & rice.

0:10:05.260,0:10:09.600
Pap & rice - let's clap for our brother.

0:10:09.600,0:10:11.140
I think that's South African, right?

0:10:11.140,0:10:13.620
Wonderful - pap & rice.

0:10:13.620,0:10:18.560
Just imagine; you have a beautiful dish of pap & rice.

0:10:18.560,0:10:26.320
Now, the moment you eat that food, you discover that the content is rotten.

0:10:26.320,0:10:28.380
How would you feel?

0:10:28.380,0:10:30.880
Disappointed and terrible.

0:10:30.880,0:10:37.640
No matter how beautiful the food looks, no matter how wonderfully it is presented,

0:10:37.640,0:10:47.020
if the content is not the same as the presentation, is disgusting, is rotten,

0:10:47.020,0:10:49.880
then the food is worthless.

0:10:49.880,0:10:52.620
Would you agree with me?

0:10:52.620,0:11:02.400
Such is the case of someone who values only the flesh, the appearance, the material possessions,

0:11:02.400,0:11:06.140
and neglects his heart.

0:11:06.140,0:11:14.400
Take care of your heart.

0:11:14.400,0:11:20.980
Let me try to use an example in relation to those of us here in the church today.

0:11:20.980,0:11:25.220
Remember, you are what is in your heart.

0:11:25.220,0:11:28.260
I am what is in my heart.

0:11:28.260,0:11:32.760
My life reflects what is in my heart.

0:11:32.760,0:11:39.240
So many people come to church today and their reason, their basis of coming to church

0:11:39.240,0:11:41.960
is because they want something from God.

0:11:41.960,0:11:48.520
Perhaps they want a miracle, healing, deliverance, breakthrough in their business,

0:11:48.520,0:11:51.420
prosperity, abundance - just name it.

0:11:51.420,0:11:54.800
They have come because of what they want from God.

0:11:54.800,0:11:57.340
But remember what Prophet T.B. Joshua said:

0:11:57.340,0:12:01.760
The heart is a landing point.

0:12:01.760,0:12:11.140
If there is an obstacle or an obstruction, God cannot land with His cargo of blessings.

0:12:11.140,0:12:14.380
Let's try and picture this.

0:12:14.380,0:12:19.060
By the grace of God, I know many of us have been privileged to travel by aircraft - we have flown.

0:12:19.060,0:12:20.840
Many of us even flew here.

0:12:20.840,0:12:24.880
Just imagine when you are coming in to land on your aircraft;

0:12:24.880,0:12:30.660
you look out - if you see the tarmac, where the plane is going to land,

0:12:30.660,0:12:33.480
you will see that everything is clear.

0:12:33.480,0:12:40.740
No obstruction, no obstacle, no hindrance - because if there is an obstacle at the point of landing,

0:12:40.740,0:12:43.520
the plane cannot successfully land.

0:12:43.520,0:12:47.540
Would you agree with me?

0:12:47.540,0:12:50.220
Can I have one chair please?

0:12:50.220,0:12:52.060
One chair.

0:12:52.060,0:12:55.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:55.900,0:12:58.820
Thank you.

0:12:58.820,0:13:04.960
I just want you to picture this, so you can understand what's happening when we come to church

0:13:04.960,0:13:08.560
seeking a miracle without taking care of our hearts.

0:13:08.560,0:13:10.780
This is the landing point.

0:13:10.780,0:13:12.520
This is the tarmac.

0:13:12.520,0:13:17.840
This is the area where the plane wants to land, but there is an obstacle,

0:13:17.840,0:13:22.320
there is a hindrance, there is a barrier!

0:13:22.320,0:13:31.000
No matter how fervently you pray, how passionately you worship, how you fast;

0:13:31.000,0:13:38.240
you do all night vigil - so far as the obstacle is still there, the plane cannot land.

0:13:38.240,0:13:43.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:43.580,0:13:48.540
Many of us start running from one place to another, trying to find solution,

0:13:48.540,0:13:52.100
not knowing that the problem is within us.

0:13:52.100,0:13:53.840
We have not removed the obstacle!

0:13:53.840,0:13:55.280
There is still an obstruction!

0:13:55.280,0:13:57.400
There is still something blocking us!

0:13:57.400,0:14:02.920
And we are busy going to this church, that church, this crusade, that crusade...

0:14:02.920,0:14:06.720
Before you know it, you get anointed water here, anointed oil here,

0:14:06.720,0:14:10.280
anointed pyjama here, anointed underwear here.

0:14:10.280,0:14:13.780
What other anointing do you want?

0:14:13.780,0:14:22.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:22.380,0:14:30.960
You run from man of God to man of God, but the problem is within you.

0:14:30.960,0:14:32.760
There is an obstacle!

0:14:32.760,0:14:34.120
And you know what happens?

0:14:34.120,0:14:36.440
This is the painful part.

0:14:36.440,0:14:42.020
By the time you run up and down, look for solution and you don't seem to see that blessing coming,

0:14:42.020,0:14:46.860
you hear the noise of the plane going over you and missing you -

0:14:46.860,0:14:49.900
someone else is receiving a blessing, someone else is receiving a touch

0:14:49.900,0:14:51.540
and you say, "Why not me?"

0:14:51.540,0:14:56.940
You begin to look at God in a bad light.

0:14:56.940,0:15:05.320
Perhaps He doesn't love me, perhaps He loves this person more than me,

0:15:05.320,0:15:09.620
perhaps my sin is too much that He cannot forgive.

0:15:09.620,0:15:15.660
And what happens when you look at God in a bad light and frustration and desperation comes?

0:15:15.660,0:15:22.460
Before you know it, you will find yourself being deceived.

0:15:22.460,0:15:24.480
Let me have another chair.

0:15:24.480,0:15:28.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:28.980,0:15:33.740
Just imagine; you, that are looking to remove the obstacle,

0:15:33.740,0:15:39.280
by the time, in that frustration, desperation someone says, "Let's go here".

0:15:39.280,0:15:44.720
You go there and you find yourself in the house of a spiritualist,

0:15:44.720,0:15:48.760
where you are touched by someone who is not supposed to touch you,

0:15:48.760,0:15:52.000
where you taste what a Christian is not supposed to taste.

0:15:52.000,0:15:57.960
Rather than removing the obstacle, you only seem to increase it.

0:15:57.960,0:16:02.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:02.080,0:16:03.940
It only seems to be getting worse!

0:16:03.940,0:16:05.060
Then what happens?

0:16:05.060,0:16:08.440
You begin to look for imaginary enemies.

0:16:08.440,0:16:12.860
"That my aunt cursed me when I was young. She is the cause.

0:16:12.860,0:16:16.900
That my grandmother - oh God; God will deal with her."

0:16:16.900,0:16:19.320
What happens? What's going on?

0:16:19.320,0:16:23.620
As a result of that - another obstacle!

0:16:23.620,0:16:25.720
Oh my God!

0:16:25.720,0:16:27.720
Another one!

0:16:27.720,0:16:31.680
You begin to say, "That my business partner duped me; he is the cause.

0:16:31.680,0:16:34.660
God will punish him. God will deal with him."

0:16:34.660,0:16:45.260
When you sit back in your setback, you wallow in your self-pity - what happens?

0:16:45.260,0:16:53.960
You begin to try and create happiness outside of God, "Let me just take some alcohol".

0:16:53.960,0:16:59.820
As you take the alcohol - what happens?

0:16:59.820,0:17:02.160
Another one!

0:17:02.160,0:17:10.700

And you want the plane to land?

0:17:13.120,0:17:20.480
You want God to come with His cargo of blessings; peace, joy, abundance, all the promises in the Scriptures,

0:17:20.480,0:17:29.420
you want them to be released unto your life, but your heart is filled with obstacles.

0:17:29.420,0:17:35.220
This is offence; you have not forgiven that person that offended you last year,

0:17:35.220,0:17:41.560
and you are here in the church today, "God, bless me. God, heal me. God, deliver me. God, set me free."

0:17:41.560,0:17:46.760
Remove offence and the blessing will come.

0:17:51.560,0:17:53.700
What am I trying to say brethren?

0:17:53.700,0:18:04.680
When you take care of your heart, God will take care of your miracle.

0:18:04.680,0:18:11.300
When you take care of your heart, God will take care of your blessing.

0:18:11.300,0:18:19.600
When you take care of your heart, God will take care of your success.

0:18:19.600,0:18:30.040
Stop looking for imaginary enemies around you and start looking within.

0:18:30.040,0:18:32.520
Tell your neighbour; say, "Neighbour,

0:18:32.520,0:18:39.740
take care of your heart; God will take care of your blessing".

0:18:39.740,0:18:47.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:47.480,0:18:55.240
By the time you take care of your heart and the obstacles are removed,

0:18:55.240,0:19:08.100
there’s free access for the Spirit of God to land and release unto you the abundance of His provision.

0:19:08.100,0:19:18.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:18.040,0:19:21.460
If you look at what is happening in the society today,

0:19:21.460,0:19:33.280
you will realise that it is common for people to value their material possessions above their heart.

0:19:33.280,0:19:39.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:39.540,0:19:42.780
This is contrary to what the Scriptures teach us.

0:19:42.780,0:19:50.840
In the Word of God we realise that the Word of God, a Spirit, creates material things -

0:19:50.840,0:19:56.300
proving that the spirit is greater than material.

0:19:56.300,0:20:03.260
Why then do we place value more on our material possessions, than our hearts?

0:20:03.260,0:20:05.700
When Job 1:21 says,

0:20:05.700,0:20:15.420
“Naked I came from my mother’s womb and naked shall I return.”

0:20:15.420,0:20:21.980
What are you fighting over today, what are you squabbling, struggling, striving over today?

0:20:21.980,0:20:27.840
Your property, position, possession, what people say about you, how people look at you...

0:20:27.840,0:20:35.780
Your concern is so much about today - you are not going to carry it to the grave.

0:20:35.780,0:20:44.180
The Spirit returns to God who gave it and the flesh returns to the dust.

0:20:44.180,0:20:46.480
Ecclesiastes 12:7

0:20:46.480,0:20:52.040
The urge to store up treasures here on earth

0:20:52.040,0:20:57.000
is the cause of killing, stealing, destruction and corruption today

0:20:57.000,0:21:00.900
but how much of those things will you carry with you to eternity?

0:21:00.900,0:21:09.720
Vanity upon vanity - all is...

0:21:09.720,0:21:13.000
Why can't we take care of our hearts?

0:21:13.000,0:21:19.020
You know, it's a practical thing; physically to have a healthy body.

0:21:19.020,0:21:22.120
You don't take what you know is poisonous.

0:21:22.120,0:21:25.480
You are told that this food, ingredients is poisonous,

0:21:25.480,0:21:28.320
if you take it, you are going to fall sick, perhaps even die.

0:21:28.320,0:21:35.080
Why would anyone take something that they know is poisonous, destructive, corruptive?

0:21:35.080,0:21:38.680
To have a healthy body, you don't take what you know is poisonous.

0:21:38.680,0:21:43.640
To have a healthy heart, don’t feed on offence.

0:21:43.640,0:21:51.360
Don’t feed on bitterness, resentment or bad feelings towards anyone.

0:21:51.360,0:21:52.920
I'm not saying they will not come.

0:21:52.920,0:22:00.820
In this world there will be trouble, test, offence - they will come,

0:22:00.820,0:22:04.120
but don't harbour them in your hearts.

0:22:04.120,0:22:07.920
Don't create room for them in your hearts.

0:22:07.920,0:22:13.600
Your heart is too precious to just give to the fruits of the flesh.

0:22:13.600,0:22:21.400
Your heart is too valuable to just give to the things of the world.

0:22:21.400,0:22:31.140
Whenever you are cheated, pause and consider your conscience.

0:22:31.140,0:22:34.180
Someone cheats you, embarrasses you, insults you;

0:22:34.180,0:22:38.760
don't just retaliate, respond, react.

0:22:38.760,0:22:42.920
Pause! Consider your conscience.

0:22:42.920,0:22:53.920
My heart is too valuable to start fighting flesh and blood; I leave the battle for God.

0:22:53.920,0:23:03.560
My heart is too precious to start exchanging words with flesh and blood; I leave the issue for God.

0:23:03.560,0:23:08.040
Because your response determines your future.

0:23:08.040,0:23:15.240
Read the Book of Ephesians 4:30-32.

0:23:15.240,0:23:27.760
The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart full of offence, unforgiveness and pain of the past.

0:23:27.760,0:23:37.660
He can't come, He can't land to release His blessings, peace, abundance of His promises,

0:23:37.660,0:23:43.320
if your heart is still full of offence.

0:23:43.320,0:23:49.260
Why can’t you let go, leave the issue with God and take care of what matters?

0:23:49.260,0:23:56.180
The secret place is a sacred place.

0:23:56.180,0:24:03.860
Anytime you have an appointment for your possessions,

0:24:03.860,0:24:09.880
remember the Creator of your possessions.

0:24:09.880,0:24:19.560
Anytime you have an appointment for your possessions, position, wealth, money, business,

0:24:19.560,0:24:32.680
remember the Creator, who is not one of those things - He is the only thing, the only reason.

0:24:32.680,0:24:40.220
Some think they have everything when money comes their way; wealth,

0:24:40.220,0:24:49.080
but that they are poor would be revealed on God's accounting day.

0:24:49.080,0:24:57.600
The rich may seem to prosper now; the wicked may seem to prosper now and live without a care -

0:24:57.600,0:25:03.100
they will spend eternity in terror and despair.

0:25:03.100,0:25:10.080
Why would we now use material possessions as a yardstick to measure our relationship with God?

0:25:10.080,0:25:13.560
I remember several years ago, and I'm sure you are aware of this...

0:25:13.560,0:25:20.260
Several years ago there was an article that was written on the internet, it was circulated and spread;

0:25:20.260,0:25:25.380
social media continued to spread this article saying, "These are the richest men of God.

0:25:25.380,0:25:31.380
They have x-amounts of money, x-amounts of this... Richest men of God".

0:25:31.380,0:25:34.340
That article was spread everywhere.

0:25:34.340,0:25:40.280
They even included the name of our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:25:40.280,0:25:43.040
But I want to tell you one thing, and you know this as well,

0:25:43.040,0:25:47.200
because you've studied the lifestyle of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:25:47.200,0:25:59.640
Whether today he has 5 dollars or 5 billion dollars, you will not see any difference in him.

0:25:59.640,0:26:02.280
You will not see any change,

0:26:02.280,0:26:13.080
because this ministry of the Holy Spirit is not about making money; it’s about saving souls.

0:26:13.080,0:26:16.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:16.100,0:26:21.220
How can we begin to use material possessions as a yardstick to measure success?

0:26:21.220,0:26:28.380
Do you know that the true measure of spiritual enrichment is contentment -

0:26:28.380,0:26:35.160
peace that surpasses all understanding, peace in the midst of the storm

0:26:35.160,0:26:37.520
and joy in the midst of the troubles.

0:26:37.520,0:26:45.860
Contentment – I am what God says I am, I have what God says I have

0:26:45.860,0:26:50.400
and I can do what God says I can do.

0:26:50.400,0:26:55.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:55.900,0:27:05.000
Contentment - that is the dividend of your relationship with God.

0:27:05.000,0:27:09.060
The Spirit is greater than the material.

0:27:09.060,0:27:13.620
Why can't we take care of our hearts, clean our hearts?

0:27:13.620,0:27:22.440
The management of our hearts and its thoughts is fundamental to our faith and holy living.

0:27:22.440,0:27:24.000
Fundamental.

0:27:24.000,0:27:33.420
It is not just trivial, something you just take by the side - it's fundamental to take care of your hearts.

0:27:33.420,0:27:35.860
Look inward.

0:27:35.860,0:27:45.400
The heart connects us to Jesus, to Him - it's all about the heart.

0:27:45.400,0:27:48.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:48.340,0:27:56.820
Once you can control your heart, you control your life.

0:27:56.820,0:28:00.960
You can get your heart to your side, temptation may come -

0:28:00.960,0:28:08.500
you quickly rebuke and reject those doubts, fears.

0:28:08.500,0:28:14.640
Refuse to take counsel with fear; refuse to entertain doubt.

0:28:14.640,0:28:19.040
Doubts must be refused and resolutely resisted.

0:28:19.040,0:28:23.380
Take captive your thoughts in obedience to Christ.

0:28:23.380,0:28:25.260
They will come.

0:28:25.260,0:28:29.740
Thoughts may come and persist in staying but you refuse to put them into words

0:28:29.740,0:28:33.260
and so they die unborn.

0:28:33.260,0:28:38.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:38.320,0:28:46.080
Brethren, to take care of your heart, your heart must be tuned to God’s Word.

0:28:46.080,0:28:52.220
Tuned, in harmony with the Word of God.

0:28:52.220,0:29:00.800
If you make God your heart’s delight, you will surely have your heart’s desires.

0:29:00.800,0:29:04.500
In conclusion:

0:29:04.500,0:29:07.840
you must balance your life.

0:29:07.840,0:29:15.920
Tell your neighbour, "Balance your life".

0:29:15.920,0:29:23.360
Anytime you nourish your physical body with natural food,

0:29:23.360,0:29:29.860
remember to nourish your soul with spiritual food.

0:29:29.860,0:29:36.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:36.880,0:29:47.000
Anytime you look in the mirror, check your appearance, clothes, dressing - that is fine;

0:29:47.000,0:29:51.580
remember to check the state of your heart.

0:29:51.580,0:29:58.380
The mirror only reveals the shell; the true me lies in the heart.

0:29:58.380,0:30:03.800
Don't let the mirror deceive you.

0:30:03.800,0:30:12.200
Anytime you take a shower, clean yourself in the morning, remove any dirt, anything in your body;

0:30:12.200,0:30:15.720
remember to clean your heart.

0:30:15.720,0:30:27.560
Is your heart free from care, worry, anxiety, offence?

0:30:27.560,0:30:36.740
These are poisonous to your spirit, heart, and block you from receiving God's blessings.

0:30:36.740,0:30:45.140
Anytime you go out in the morning to fend for your family, to work for your daily bread, earn a living -

0:30:45.140,0:30:51.260
it's good; I'm not trying to tell you you can't do that - you must, of course.

0:30:51.260,0:30:59.460
Take care of your spiritual life because that is the engine that carries your success.

0:30:59.460,0:31:05.080
You can have a beautiful car, the latest model, the most fantasticly presented -

0:31:05.080,0:31:09.100
if there is no engine, can the car work?

0:31:09.100,0:31:16.180
Why would you be so consumed by painting the car, getting the latest design, and there is no engine,

0:31:16.180,0:31:19.880
or the engine is broken?

0:31:19.880,0:31:28.140
Take care of your heart, the ‘man himself’ – the real you, the true you.

0:31:28.140,0:31:34.180
You can be emotionally or physically stressed,

0:31:34.180,0:31:41.080
but please, please, do not be spiritually stressed.

0:31:41.080,0:31:45.260
Because if you are, you would lose focus on God.

0:31:45.260,0:31:52.140
Focusing on you may lead to stress but focusing on God leads to rest.

0:31:52.140,0:32:04.540
When you become God-minded, Word-minded, the Word of God dominates your heart -

0:32:04.540,0:32:17.320
your heart will unconsciously go to Him for guidance, wisdom, strength, provision, protection.

0:32:17.320,0:32:20.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:20.820,0:32:28.620
May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus’ name.
