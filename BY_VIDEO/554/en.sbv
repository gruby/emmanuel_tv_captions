0:00:00.000,0:00:07.500
Viewers all over the world, I say you are blessed.

0:00:07.500,0:00:09.720
The message: ONLY BELIEVE.

0:00:09.720,0:00:10.720
Tell your neighbour

0:00:10.720,0:00:11.680
ONLY BELIEVE

0:00:11.680,0:00:12.820
I can't hear you.

0:00:12.820,0:00:14.100
ONLY BELIEVE

0:00:14.100,0:00:15.100
I can't hear you.

0:00:15.100,0:00:17.720
ONLY BELIEVE

0:00:17.720,0:00:20.820
The Book of Mark 5:1,

0:00:20.820,0:00:28.560
"Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of Gadarenes.

0:00:28.560,0:00:41.500
And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him

0:00:41.500,0:00:48.480
out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit

0:00:48.480,0:01:02.060
who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains..."

0:01:02.060,0:01:05.920
Physical combat. Listen to that.

0:01:05.920,0:01:10.960
"...because he had often been bound with shackles and chains.

0:01:10.960,0:01:18.940
And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces;

0:01:18.940,0:01:22.820
neither could anyone tame him."

0:01:22.820,0:01:27.220
Can you see how wild the crazy man was?

0:01:27.220,0:01:34.780
"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains ,

0:01:34.780,0:01:39.840
crying out and cutting himself with stones.

0:01:39.840,0:01:44.720
As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken,

0:01:44.720,0:01:51.480
He said to the ruler of the synagogue, 'Do not be afraid; only believe'."

0:01:51.480,0:02:12.120
I have no other refuge than this command of Jesus, 'Only Believe'.

0:02:12.120,0:02:17.280
I am talking of behalf of myself and my household.

0:02:17.280,0:02:24.020
I know you are one of them.

0:02:24.020,0:02:25.700
Listen to that.

0:02:25.700,0:02:34.080
I have no other refuge than this command of Jesus, 'Only Believe'.

0:02:34.080,0:02:37.300
If you are asking me, "How do you believe? Whom are we believing?"

0:02:37.300,0:02:43.540
If I believe you, it`s different from believing God.

0:02:43.540,0:02:47.760
You are here and God is a Spirit.

0:02:47.760,0:02:50.940
Can you see what we are talking about?

0:02:50.940,0:02:57.380
Here you are, and God is a Spirit.

0:02:57.380,0:03:07.640
If God is a Spirit, you must believe Him by the Spirit's power.

0:03:07.640,0:03:13.160
You can only believe Him by the Spirit's power.

0:03:13.160,0:03:16.240
By what? - By the Spirit's power.

0:03:16.240,0:03:18.980
Not just, "I believe you, brother".

0:03:18.980,0:03:25.360
It's different from believing in God because God is Spirit.

0:03:25.360,0:03:35.420
We must depend upon God's Spirit for our assistance and strength.

0:03:35.420,0:03:42.980
We must depend upon God's Spirit for our relationship with Him.

0:03:42.980,0:03:48.120
If I want to have a relationship with you, I will have it with you. I know you, I talk to you.

0:03:48.120,0:03:55.920
But to God, I must depend on God's Spirit for my relationship with Him

0:03:55.920,0:03:58.300
because God is Spirit.

0:03:58.300,0:04:02.320
How can we worship Him in Spirit and truth?

0:04:02.320,0:04:12.480
We worship God In Spirit and truth when all our purpose and passion of our heart

0:04:12.480,0:04:21.540
and when all our acts of worship - dancing, singing, praying -

0:04:21.540,0:04:29.060
are regulated and guided by the Word of God.

0:04:29.060,0:04:34.940
The question again: How do we worship God in Spirit and truth?

0:04:34.940,0:04:44.020
We worship God in Spirit when all our purpose and passion of our heart

0:04:44.020,0:04:51.360
and when all our act of worship - you know what I mean by act of worship -

0:04:51.360,0:05:02.020
singing, fasting, or meditating, "In Jesus' name"...

0:05:02.020,0:05:09.420
When all our purpose and passion of our heart,

0:05:09.420,0:05:20.580
when all our acts of worship - dancing, singing, praying, fasting, meditating -

0:05:20.580,0:05:27.400
are guided and regulated by the Word of God.

0:05:27.400,0:05:31.540
That is how we know we are under the influence of the Holy Ghost.

0:05:31.540,0:05:36.080
He does nothing without His Word.

0:05:36.080,0:05:41.620
He does nothing without what? - His Word.

0:05:41.620,0:05:48.980
We should be awake to the fact that we must believe.

0:05:48.980,0:05:54.020
If you can, all things are possible.

0:05:54.020,0:06:03.340
If you can, all things are what? - Possible.

0:06:03.340,0:06:11.760
Whenever we truly believe, our hearts will be at rest.

0:06:11.760,0:06:14.580
Remember, truly believe - I put truly.

0:06:14.580,0:06:25.500
Whenever we truly believe, our hearts will be at what? - At rest.

0:06:25.500,0:06:36.740
If our hearts are uneasy and restless, if we are afraid of this and that,

0:06:36.740,0:06:43.300
this shows that we have not yet believed.

0:06:43.300,0:06:48.980
When one believes, he is at rest.

0:06:48.980,0:06:56.260
When a person believes, he will no longer worry.

0:06:56.260,0:07:02.420
The kind of rest I am talking about is real, genuine and natural.

0:07:02.420,0:07:12.400
It is not a pretentious calm, unnatural self-restraint

0:07:12.400,0:07:20.720
or acting as if nothing has happened.

0:07:20.720,0:07:22.520
Let someone say, "Only Believe".

0:07:22.520,0:07:23.580
ONLY BELIEVE

0:07:23.580,0:07:24.540
I cant hear you.

0:07:24.540,0:07:28.780
ONLY BELIEVE

0:07:28.780,0:07:39.640
We must believe and rest unconditionally and absolutely upon the Word of God.

0:07:39.640,0:07:45.160
Overflow Congregation

0:07:45.160,0:07:55.400
Take note: Faith does not rest in itself; God is the place where faith rests.

0:07:55.400,0:08:00.940
There is no faith in faith.

0:08:00.940,0:08:08.140
But faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:08:08.140,0:08:18.280
We do not need to force ourselves to believe that Jesus is Lord.

0:08:18.280,0:08:23.580
There is no need for us to struggle to believe.

0:08:23.580,0:08:28.400
This is the way with all kinds of faith.

0:08:28.400,0:08:33.120
Faith in faith, faith in this, faith in that.

0:08:33.120,0:08:40.180
If believers are not careful, they will be deceived.

0:08:40.180,0:08:44.840
If believers are not careful, they will be what?

0:08:44.840,0:08:51.700
They will be deceived because of their desperation.

0:08:51.700,0:08:54.360
Because of what? - Desperation.

0:08:54.360,0:09:02.940
When you are desperate, you don't mind where the solution comes from.

0:09:02.940,0:09:10.820
And you remember when satan was telling Jesus - he knew he was very, very hungry.

0:09:10.820,0:09:16.600
He took him up. He thought, Jesus was desperate.

0:09:16.600,0:09:19.240
He said, "If you can do this, you will be ok".

0:09:19.240,0:09:23.800
Jesus said, "Look, I am hungry but I am not desperate".

0:09:23.800,0:09:29.700
If believers are not careful, they will be deceived.

0:09:29.700,0:09:39.060
This is the way with all kinds of faith today.

0:09:39.060,0:09:51.620
When you are not living in the Spirit, you cannot live in the process of God's mind

0:09:51.620,0:09:57.320
and act according to His will.

0:09:57.320,0:10:07.000
But take note of this: We are to be sons of God with power.

0:10:07.000,0:10:08.300
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:08.300,0:10:11.440
[We are to be sons of God with power.]

0:10:11.440,0:10:13.080
Tell your neighbour once again.

0:10:13.080,0:10:15.600
[We are to be sons of God with power.]

0:10:15.600,0:10:16.660
I can't hear you.

0:10:16.660,0:10:21.540
[We are to be sons of God with power.]

0:10:21.540,0:10:34.160
We are to be born again with power.

0:10:34.160,0:10:39.320
We are to be evangelists with power.

0:10:39.320,0:10:43.780
We are to be pastors with power.

0:10:43.780,0:10:48.200
We are to be Christians with power.

0:10:48.200,0:10:52.380
We are to be prophets with power.

0:10:52.380,0:10:56.440
I don't know what you can be with God without power.

0:10:56.440,0:11:05.180
Because the Bible says, To be saved is to have revelation of the glory of Christ Jesus.

0:11:05.180,0:11:14.000
To be what? - To be saved is to have revelation of the glory of Christ Jesus.

0:11:14.000,0:11:27.800
And what is the revelation? - The revelation of God: 'Only Believe.' Thank you.

0:11:27.800,0:11:32.920
Whisper it to your neighbour.

0:11:32.920,0:11:42.860
That is why someone can be in America, South, West, North, Asia country and be connected with us here.

0:11:42.860,0:11:51.000
Only Believe.

0:11:51.000,0:11:59.440
That is why one does not need to come here before getting healed.

0:11:59.440,0:12:01.360
By revelation.

0:12:01.360,0:12:07.160
To be saved is to have revelation of the glory of Christ.

0:12:07.160,0:12:12.340
And the revelation of God: 'Only Believe'.

0:12:12.340,0:12:27.840
The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.

0:12:27.840,0:12:30.280
Do you see the way I grab it?

0:12:30.280,0:12:43.960
The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.

0:12:43.960,0:12:53.480
But it can be very, very risky if you have not received the message of the gospel of Christ,

0:12:53.480,0:12:57.580
if you have not received the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit.

0:12:57.580,0:13:02.780
if you have not believed by the Spirit power,

0:13:02.780,0:13:15.340
forcing yourself to do such is indeed a risk.

0:13:15.340,0:13:24.780
When God comes to ask for worshippers, the question will not be,

0:13:24.780,0:13:28.280
"Who worshipped at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations?"

0:13:28.280,0:13:31.720
"Who worshipped at Jerusalem?"

0:13:31.720,0:13:34.780
"Who worshipped at that church or this church?"

0:13:34.780,0:13:43.600
But "Who worshipped in Spirit and truth?"

0:13:43.600,0:13:44.740
Tell your neighbour.

0:13:44.740,0:13:55.160
When God comes to ask for worshippers, the question will not be,

0:13:55.160,0:14:00.980
"Who worshipped at Jerusalem,

0:14:00.980,0:14:06.380
at The Synagogue, at that church or this church?"

0:14:06.380,0:14:18.240
but "Who worshipped in Spirit and truth?"

0:14:18.240,0:14:26.100
Because God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.

0:14:26.100,0:14:40.620
But today, we refer to the Spirit, "The Spirit of God says this, the Spirit of God says that.

0:14:40.620,0:14:48.000
In the letter, the Spirit of God says this, the Spirit of God says that".

0:14:48.000,0:14:55.020
To how many does the Spirit Of God actually talks to?

0:14:55.020,0:15:04.660
The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.

0:15:04.660,0:15:17.340
Remember, 'Only Believe' - the revelation of God.

0:15:17.340,0:15:23.060
Rise up and talk to your heart.

0:15:23.060,0:15:27.420
Speak to your heart.

0:15:27.420,0:15:35.520
You have received so much and this message should not go without opening the door of your heart.

0:15:35.520,0:15:38.900
This message must open the door of my heart today.

0:15:38.900,0:15:42.740
Here I am, Lord, send me.

0:15:42.740,0:15:48.740
