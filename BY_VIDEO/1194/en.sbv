Prophecy Time

0:00:09.480,0:00:11.080
Where are you living?

0:00:11.080,0:00:13.340
I'm living in Sweden.

0:00:13.340,0:00:18.060
You have to live a proper life. The life you are living is not good.

0:00:18.060,0:00:20.840
Yes, man of God.

0:00:20.840,0:00:22.720
The life you are living is not good.

0:00:22.720,0:00:24.160
It's true, man of God.

0:00:24.160,0:00:26.160
You can not continue living this life.

0:00:26.160,0:00:28.160
Yes, man of God.

0:00:28.160,0:00:35.460
What's next now? Even the document you are due, you are not supposed to stay there till now.

0:00:35.460,0:00:37.020
Yes, man of God.

0:00:37.020,0:00:39.620
Everything is expired, yet you are still living there.

0:00:39.620,0:00:45.140
And how can you live a life of fear? You are not free.

0:00:45.140,0:00:51.680
Yes, man of God. I have been living in Sweden. My child was taken

0:00:51.680,0:00:57.020
because they said that the way I train him is not the right way they train in Sweden.

0:00:57.020,0:00:59.020
Wait, do you listen to what I'm saying?

0:00:59.020,0:00:59.800
Yes.

0:00:59.800,0:01:02.500
I say the life you are living is bad.

0:01:02.500,0:01:04.960
Yes.

0:01:04.960,0:01:10.760
Not only your child. You too you were once in a custody of security.

0:01:10.760,0:01:13.480
Yes, man of God. It's true.

0:01:13.480,0:01:14.480
And your child is there now.

0:01:14.480,0:01:16.280
Yes, man of God. It's true.

0:01:16.280,0:01:17.940
They took away your child.

0:01:17.940,0:01:19.100
Yes, man of God.

0:01:19.100,0:01:24.180
That's what I am saying - the life you live. You have to change.

0:01:24.180,0:01:28.040
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:28.040,0:01:30.940
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:30.940,0:01:34.300
People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:34.300,0:01:42.380
My name is Chamaka Anodu. We come from Sweden and the child beside me is Emmanuel Anodu.

0:01:42.380,0:01:45.260
- And who is he to you? 
- He is my son.

0:01:45.260,0:01:54.980
Last year was very very terrible for me. I was depressed, I became suicidal.

0:01:54.980,0:02:01.340
I was crying, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even eat. I couldn't concentrate on my studies or on anything

0:02:01.340,0:02:08.280
because my son was taken away. So I had to come to SCOAN immediately to seek the face of God.

0:02:08.280,0:02:11.540
What do you mean by your son was taken away?

0:02:11.540,0:02:16.460
My son was taken in custody by the authorities in Sweden.

0:02:16.460,0:02:20.120
Because he was stubborn in school, so I hit him.

0:02:20.120,0:02:24.440
He went to school and told his teachers, so they took him.

0:02:24.440,0:02:31.080
So I had to run down to the SCOAN to seek the face of God.

0:02:31.080,0:02:36.320
And when I came, I was opportuned out of the many people here...

0:02:36.320,0:02:41.900
I was oppurtuned to receive the prophecy from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:41.900,0:02:49.840
He explained me the root cause of my problem and I confirm the whole prophesy to be true.

0:02:49.840,0:02:53.640
And he also mentioned that your child was in custody, right?

0:02:53.640,0:02:56.200
Yes.

0:02:56.200,0:03:06.360
So after my stay in SCOAN, I went back to Sweden. We went to court again.

0:03:06.360,0:03:11.740
And when we got to the court room, we spent more than seven hours deliberating

0:03:11.740,0:03:17.540
whether they will give me this child or not. Even in the court room, I was praying,

0:03:17.540,0:03:23.300
spraying the Morning Water saying: "God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, see me through!

0:03:23.300,0:03:27.760
You are the only one that will give me victory in this case.

0:03:27.760,0:03:36.000
So after the court hearing, as I was going with the lawyer, the lawyer told me:

0:03:36.000,0:03:41.400
"You can not win this case. It very difficult for people to win cases like this."

0:03:41.400,0:03:50.680
I became scared. But I picked up courage, I said: "No, I have the God - the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:03:50.680,0:03:57.580
And this God is bigger than any government of the world, and I will have victory in this case."

0:03:57.580,0:04:02.180
Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:04:02.180,0:04:05.720
A statement of faith indeed.

0:04:05.720,0:04:13.300
So after that she told me: "Let this your God save you, if He is true." I said ok.

0:04:13.300,0:04:16.880
So, a week later, she called me and said: "Congratulations."

0:04:16.880,0:04:19.360
Immediately she called me I was scared.

0:04:19.360,0:04:24.860
She said: "Congratulations, this your God has saved you. You won the case."

0:04:24.860,0:04:30.400
Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

0:04:30.400,0:04:39.780
So after prophesy I went back to Sweden. I made my life in the way God,

0:04:39.780,0:04:43.620
as man of God said in the prophesy. I made my life in the way of God.

0:04:43.620,0:04:51.600
And my academics which  was not going well, started becoming very good and better.

0:04:51.600,0:05:01.060
And now I have two master's degrees - all to the Grace of God and my son is with me also.

0:05:01.060,0:05:05.660
Hallelujah! So you mean after this message of prophesy from the man of God

0:05:05.660,0:05:12.880
you went back to Sweden and the court case ended to your favour and your son was released

0:05:12.880,0:05:15.280
to you by the authorities. Is that right?

0:05:15.280,0:05:25.540
Yes. Even then that the court gave the other party three weeks to appeal this case, if they want -

0:05:25.540,0:05:29.200
but we did not hear from the other party;  they didn't say anything.

0:05:29.200,0:05:35.080
And the court then gave me  the instruction that I can now go and bring my son back.

0:05:35.080,0:05:37.980
I then went and brought him back.

0:05:37.980,0:05:44.780
That is why we are here today to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua for restoring my life.

0:05:44.780,0:05:49.960
Because then, I was depressed, I was running mental. I didn't know what to do.

0:05:49.960,0:05:55.380
But today, I am glowing in the Lord. Thank you, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:05:55.380,0:06:00.280
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:00.280,0:06:08.660
Ok, now tell us, in a case like this ordinarily - how long was your son supposed to spend in custody?

0:06:08.660,0:06:14.100
My case was very controversial and very difficult.The court said my son was going to stay

0:06:14.100,0:06:17.260
with them until he was eighteen years.

0:06:17.260,0:06:18.980
And how old was your son?

0:06:18.980,0:06:22.640
He was 7 years old when he was taken.

0:06:22.640,0:06:29.120
And I don't know how I could manage it. And he would lack motherly care.

0:06:29.120,0:06:33.840
I said: "How will I manage this?" That is why I had to come.

0:06:33.840,0:06:43.820
And in these cases, a lot of people that have this problem - they have not received their children

0:06:43.820,0:06:49.240
but in my case people were asking: "What is your secret? How did you do this?"

0:06:49.240,0:06:52.900
I said: "It is the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua that did it for me."

0:06:52.900,0:06:56.020
Let's clap for Jesus Christ.

0:06:56.020,0:07:00.940
So we thank God. Can we just hear from our little brother.

0:07:00.940,0:07:02.480
Hallo. How are you?

0:07:02.480,0:07:03.140
Fine.

0:07:03.140,0:07:04.680
Tell us your name.

0:07:04.680,0:07:07.020
My name is Chisom.

0:07:07.020,0:07:09.320
And how old are you?

0:07:09.320,0:07:10.020
Eight.

0:07:10.020,0:07:13.320
And the woman standing beside you - who is she to you?

0:07:13.320,0:07:14.520
She is my mother.

0:07:14.520,0:07:17.620
Your mother. And you happy to be with your mother again?

0:07:17.620,0:07:19.300
Yes.

0:07:19.300,0:07:22.940
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:07:22.940,0:07:28.540
So thank you, madam.We thank God Almighty for intervening in your situation.

0:07:28.540,0:07:37.000
And now that the battle is over, we want to encourage you to make God's Word a standard for your life

0:07:37.000,0:07:42.080
and to bring up your son in the way of the Lord, so that when he grows up, he will not depart from it.

0:07:42.080,0:07:46.320
And we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.

0:07:46.320,0:07:47.400
Amen!

0:07:47.400,0:07:51.480
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:07:51.480,0:07:56.780
My name is  Shemaclatta Chiamaka. I am a Nigerian but I live in Sweden.

0:07:56.780,0:08:01.160
And the boy next to me is my son, Emmanuel Anodu.

0:08:01.160,0:08:07.620
Last year, my son was taken away by the social authorities in Sweden

0:08:07.620,0:08:12.940
because of the correction I gave to him which he went to school and reported.

0:08:12.940,0:08:16.740
And they decided that the child will not be coming back home again.

0:08:16.740,0:08:28.740
He was taken into custody and put into a foster home where he stayed for that period.

0:08:28.740,0:08:31.320
And I was not allowed to see him.

0:08:31.320,0:08:39.180
So during the period when my child was away I was depressed, I had memory loss.

0:08:39.180,0:08:41.600
I couldn't concentrate, I was devastated.

0:08:41.600,0:08:47.620
I couldn't do anything. So that was the effect that it had on me.

0:08:47.620,0:08:50.780
One of the reasons why I was devastated and depressed,

0:08:50.780,0:09:00.320
was that it was very controversial and tough case and it wasn't easy.

0:09:00.320,0:09:07.240
Regarding the type of case that it was, involving a child and abuse.

0:09:07.240,0:09:13.480
I went to different people for help and advice and they told me that there is no way out

0:09:13.480,0:09:20.340
because a lot of families have lost their kids to the social authority.

0:09:20.340,0:09:27.500
And it was very difficult for me to be able to get my son back

0:09:27.500,0:09:34.000
So I had to run down to SCOAN to seek the face of God concerning the situation.

0:09:34.000,0:09:37.900
And I was opportuned to receive a prophesy from the man of God

0:09:37.900,0:09:44.160
regarding my past life and concerning the issue of my child's case.

0:09:44.160,0:09:52.640
He told me that my son will be released and that everything will be fine.

0:09:52.640,0:09:56.800
And then I went back to Sweden.

0:09:56.800,0:10:04.000
Few weeks later, I was invited to the court in regards to the same case.

0:10:04.000,0:10:11.080
And after the court  proceedings the case was judged in my favour.

0:10:11.080,0:10:18.220
And my son was released back to me. Which was a miracle.

0:10:18.220,0:10:24.320
So here I am today. I am happy, I thank God. I have my son beside me.

0:10:24.320,0:10:27.400
And everything is settled in Jesus' name.

0:10:27.400,0:10:33.700
The joy of every mother is to be with their children and my joy has been restored in Jesus' name.

0:10:33.700,0:10:37.900
Amen. We give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your life

0:10:37.900,0:10:41.720
and rejoice for this wonderful thing that  God Almighty has done.

0:10:41.720,0:10:44.880
We would like to hear a word from your son.

0:10:44.880,0:10:53.440
My name is Chisom. I am from Stockholm, Sweden.

0:10:53.440,0:10:54.100
How old are you?

0:10:54.100,0:10:55.000
8.

0:10:55.000,0:10:57.420
And who is the woman beside you?

0:10:57.420,0:10:58.220
My mum.

0:10:58.220,0:11:00.600
And how are you feeling now?

0:11:00.600,0:11:03.140
Good. I am happy to be home.

0:11:03.140,0:11:08.080
Wow! We rejoice with you that you are back home and we thank God Almighty.

0:11:08.080,0:11:11.780
We know that the best is yet to come in your lives in Jesus' name.

0:11:11.780,0:11:17.260
The only advice I have for parents who are experiencing what I have passed through

0:11:17.260,0:11:21.540
is that with God all things are possible in Jesus' name.

0:11:21.540,0:11:26.020
Amen! Indeed, with God Almighty, all things are possible.

0:11:26.020,0:11:30.240
He is the final authority, answering all questions and settling all issues.

0:11:30.240,0:11:34.380
And we know that He has settled your issues, He will also settle theirs in Jesus' name.

0:11:34.380,0:11:35.300
Amen!

0:11:35.300,0:11:38.780
So we rejoice with you once again for what God Almighty has done in your life.

0:11:38.780,0:11:42.760
And Prophet T.B.Joshua, seeing what you have been through in the past -

0:11:42.760,0:11:46.260
just like you explained you were devastated you were disturbed,

0:11:46.260,0:11:52.880
like every mother would be - man of God has sent us on behalf of himself and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:11:52.880,0:11:58.700
He is blessing you with a sum of 150 000 Naira for the upkeep of your son.

0:11:58.700,0:12:03.060
We know that the good Lord who that started His work in your life will definitely complete it.

0:12:03.060,0:12:08.660
And we know that the best is yet to come. All you need to do is continue to walk in the light of God

0:12:08.660,0:12:14.340
and train up this child in the way of God so that as he grows up, he will not depart from it in Jesus' name.

0:12:14.340,0:12:19.220
Amen! I was not expecting this from the man of God, truly.

0:12:19.220,0:12:29.660
And I want to use this opportunity to thank man of God for the gift of the money and also of the Mirror book.

0:12:29.660,0:12:39.440
And also I want to thank man of God for his kindness, his assistance

0:12:39.440,0:12:46.620
and all the role he played during the time  I ran down to SCOAN for this help.

0:12:46.620,0:12:53.320
I also want to thank man of God for the $1000 he gave to me, when I came also.

0:12:53.320,0:12:58.620
I am truly blessed with all this financial, with all the money he gave to me.

0:12:58.620,0:13:01.800
I am truly blessed. Thank you, man of God for these gifts.

0:13:01.800,0:13:06.920

0:13:06.920,0:13:10.760
Thank you! Thank you so much, man of God, thank you!

0:13:10.760,0:13:14.900
We thank God Almighty. Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.

0:13:14.900,0:13:19.380
We believe that many more testimonies are to come from your family in Jesus' name.
