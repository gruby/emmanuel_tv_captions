Prophecy Time

0:00:09.080,0:00:11.080
Where are you living?

0:00:11.080,0:00:13.120
I'm living in Sweden.

0:00:13.120,0:00:18.560
You have to live a proper life. The life you are living is not good.

0:00:18.560,0:00:20.840
Yes, man of God.

0:00:20.840,0:00:22.820
The life you are living is not good.

0:00:22.820,0:00:23.760
It's true, man of God.

0:00:23.760,0:00:26.120
You cannot continue living this life.

0:00:26.120,0:00:28.160
Yes, man of God.

0:00:28.160,0:00:35.800
What's next now? Even the document - you are due, you are not supposed to stay there till now.

0:00:35.800,0:00:36.560
Yes, man of God.

0:00:36.560,0:00:39.860
Everything is expired, yet you are still living there.

0:00:39.860,0:00:45.400
And how can you live a life of fear? You are not free.

0:00:45.400,0:00:51.040
Yes, man of God. I have been living in Sweden. My child was taken

0:00:51.040,0:00:56.740
because they said that the way I train him is not the right way they train in Sweden.

0:00:56.740,0:00:58.960
Wait, do you listen to what I'm saying?

0:00:58.960,0:00:59.800
Yes.

0:00:59.800,0:01:02.500
I say the life you are living is bad.

0:01:02.500,0:01:04.460
Yes.

0:01:04.460,0:01:10.760
Not only your child. You too you were once in the custody of security.

0:01:10.760,0:01:12.960
Yes, man of God. It's true.

0:01:12.960,0:01:14.480
And your child is there now.

0:01:14.480,0:01:16.060
Yes, man of God. It's true.

0:01:16.060,0:01:17.780
They took away your child.

0:01:17.780,0:01:19.000
Yes, man of God.

0:01:19.000,0:01:23.860
That's what I am saying - the life you live. You have to change.

0:01:23.860,0:01:27.820
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:27.820,0:01:30.940
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:30.940,0:01:34.160
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:34.160,0:01:41.960
My name is Chamaka Anodu. We come from Sweden and the child beside me is Emmanuel Anodu.

0:01:41.960,0:01:45.260
- And who is he to you? 
- He is my son.

0:01:45.260,0:01:54.820
Last year was very very terrible for me. I was depressed, I became suicidal.

0:01:54.820,0:01:56.980
I was crying, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even eat.

0:01:56.980,0:02:03.780
I couldn't concentrate on my studies or on any other thing because my son was taken away.

0:02:03.780,0:02:08.280
So I had to come to The SCOAN immediately to seek the face of God.

0:02:08.280,0:02:11.340
What do you mean by your son was taken away?

0:02:11.340,0:02:16.140
My son was taken into custody by the authorities in Sweden

0:02:16.140,0:02:19.820
because he was stubborn in school, so I hit him.

0:02:19.820,0:02:24.940
He went to school and told his teachers; so they took him.

0:02:24.940,0:02:30.600
I had to run down to The SCOAN to seek the face of God.

0:02:30.600,0:02:36.040
And when I came, I was opportune out of the many people here...

0:02:36.040,0:02:41.600
I was oppurtune to receive the prophecy from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:41.600,0:02:49.660
He told me the root cause of my problem and I confirm the whole prophecy to be true.

0:02:49.660,0:02:53.240
And he also mentioned that your child was in custody, right?

0:02:53.240,0:02:55.800
Yes.

0:02:55.800,0:03:05.780
So after my stay in The SCOAN, I went back to Sweden. We went to court again.

0:03:05.780,0:03:11.020
When we got to the court room, we spent more than seven hours

0:03:11.020,0:03:15.400
deliberating whether they would give me this child or not.

0:03:15.400,0:03:19.660
Even in the court room, I was praying, spraying the Morning Water and saying,

0:03:19.660,0:03:23.460
"God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, see me through!

0:03:23.460,0:03:27.360
You are the only One who can give me victory in this case".

0:03:27.360,0:03:35.560
After the court hearing, as I was going with the lawyer, the lawyer told me,

0:03:35.560,0:03:40.920
"You cannot win this case. It is very difficult for people to win cases like this".

0:03:40.920,0:03:43.860
I became scared.

0:03:43.860,0:03:50.120
But I picked up courage and said, "No, I have a God - the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:03:50.120,0:03:57.380
And this God is bigger than any government of the world, and I will have victory in this case".

0:03:57.380,0:04:01.780
Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:04:01.780,0:04:05.360
A statement of faith indeed.

0:04:05.360,0:04:12.760
After that she told me, "Let this your God save you, if He is true". I said okay.

0:04:12.760,0:04:16.880
A week later, she called me and said, "Congratulations".

0:04:16.880,0:04:19.240
Immediately she called me, I was scared.

0:04:19.240,0:04:24.420
She said, "Congratulations, this your God has saved you. You won the case".

0:04:24.420,0:04:30.400
Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

0:04:30.400,0:04:39.780
After the prophecy I went back to Sweden and made my life in the way God,

0:04:39.780,0:04:44.080
as the man of God said in the prophecy

0:04:44.080,0:04:51.120
and my academics which were not going well, started becoming better.

0:04:51.120,0:05:00.460
Now I have two Master's degrees - all by the grace of God and my son is with me also.

0:05:00.460,0:05:05.660
Hallelujah! So you mean after this message of prophecy from the man of God,

0:05:05.660,0:05:12.880
you went back to Sweden and the court case ended to your favour and your son was released

0:05:12.880,0:05:14.980
to you by the authorities. Is that right?

0:05:14.980,0:05:25.040
Yes. Even then, the court gave the other party three weeks to appeal this case, if they wanted -

0:05:25.040,0:05:29.380
but we did not hear from the other party;  they didn't say anything.

0:05:29.380,0:05:35.380
The court then gave me the instruction that I could go and take my son back.

0:05:35.380,0:05:37.980
I then went and brought him back.

0:05:37.980,0:05:44.600
That is why we are here today to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua for restoring my life

0:05:44.600,0:05:49.960
because then, I was depressed, I was running mental. I didn't know what to do.

0:05:49.960,0:05:55.380
But today, I am glowing in the Lord. Thank You, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:05:55.380,0:05:59.980
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:59.980,0:06:08.660
Ok, now tell us, in a case like this, ordinarily - how long was your son supposed to spend in custody?

0:06:08.660,0:06:12.560
My case was very controversial and very difficult.

0:06:12.560,0:06:17.260
The court said my son was going to stay with them until he was eighteen years old.

0:06:17.260,0:06:18.820
And how old was your son?

0:06:18.820,0:06:22.940
He was 7 years old when he was taken.

0:06:22.940,0:06:28.860
I don't know how I could manage it and he would lack motherly care.

0:06:28.860,0:06:33.920
I said, "How will I manage this?" That was why I had to come.

0:06:33.920,0:06:43.820
And in these cases, a lot of people that have this problem - they have not received their children

0:06:43.820,0:06:48.860
but in my case, people were asking, "What is your secret? How did you do this?"

0:06:48.860,0:06:52.100
I said, "It is the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua that did it for me".

0:06:52.100,0:06:55.720
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ.

0:06:55.720,0:07:00.940
We thank God. Can we just hear from our little brother.

0:07:00.940,0:07:02.100
Hello. How are you?

0:07:02.100,0:07:02.760
Fine.

0:07:02.760,0:07:04.180
Tell us your name.

0:07:04.180,0:07:05.800
My name is Chisom.

0:07:05.800,0:07:09.320
And how old are you?

0:07:09.320,0:07:10.400
I am eight.

0:07:10.400,0:07:13.080
And the woman standing beside you - who is she to you?

0:07:13.080,0:07:14.160
She is my mother.

0:07:14.160,0:07:18.120
Your mother. And you are happy to be with your mother again?

0:07:18.120,0:07:18.900
Yes.

0:07:18.900,0:07:23.300
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:07:23.300,0:07:28.540
Thank you, madam. We thank God Almighty for intervening in your situation.

0:07:28.540,0:07:37.220
And now that the battle is over, we want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your life

0:07:37.220,0:07:41.980
and to bring up your son in the way of the Lord, so that when he grows up, he will not depart from it

0:07:41.980,0:07:46.320
and we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.

0:07:46.320,0:07:47.200
Amen!

0:07:47.200,0:07:50.960
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:07:50.960,0:07:56.560
My name is  Shemaclatta Chiamaka. I am a Nigerian but I live in Sweden.

0:07:56.560,0:08:00.760
And the boy next to me is my son, Emmanuel Anodu.

0:08:00.760,0:08:07.100
Last year, my son was taken away by the social authorities in Sweden

0:08:07.100,0:08:12.440
because of the correction I gave to him which he went to school and reported.

0:08:12.440,0:08:16.920
They decided that the child would not be coming home again.

0:08:16.920,0:08:28.280
He was taken into custody and put into a foster home where he stayed for that period.

0:08:28.280,0:08:31.480
I was not allowed to see him.

0:08:31.480,0:08:38.520
During the period my child was away, I was depressed, I had memory loss.

0:08:38.520,0:08:41.600
I couldn't concentrate, I was devastated.

0:08:41.600,0:08:47.620
I couldn't do anything. So that was the effect that it had on me.

0:08:47.620,0:08:50.920
One of the reasons why I was devastated and depressed,

0:08:50.920,0:09:00.520
was that it was a very controversial and tough case and it wasn't easy -

0:09:00.520,0:09:07.240
regarding the type of case that it was, involving a child and abuse.

0:09:07.240,0:09:13.480
I went to different people for help and advice and they told me that there was no way out

0:09:13.480,0:09:19.980
because a lot of families have lost their kids to the social authority

0:09:19.980,0:09:27.160
and it was very difficult for me to be able to get my son back.

0:09:27.160,0:09:34.000
So I had to run down to The SCOAN to seek the face of God concerning the situation.

0:09:34.000,0:09:37.860
I was opportune to receive a prophecy from the man of God

0:09:37.860,0:09:44.340
regarding my past life and concerning the issue of my child's case.

0:09:44.340,0:09:52.240
He told me that my son will be released and that everything will be fine.

0:09:52.240,0:09:56.280
And then I went back to Sweden.

0:09:56.280,0:10:03.580
Few weeks later, I was invited to the court in regards to the same case.

0:10:03.580,0:10:11.340
After the court  proceedings, the case was judged in my favour

0:10:11.340,0:10:17.820
and my son was released back to me which was a miracle.

0:10:17.820,0:10:23.820
So here I am today. I am happy, I thank God. I have my son beside me.

0:10:23.820,0:10:26.980
And everything is settled, in Jesus' name.

0:10:26.980,0:10:33.780
The joy of every mother is to be with their children and my joy has been restored, in Jesus' name.

0:10:33.780,0:10:37.900
Amen. We give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your life

0:10:37.900,0:10:41.480
and rejoice for this wonderful thing that God Almighty has done.

0:10:41.480,0:10:44.880
We would like to hear a word from your son.

0:10:44.880,0:10:52.620
My name is Chisom. I am from Stockholm, Sweden.

0:10:52.620,0:10:54.100
How old are you?

0:10:54.100,0:10:55.160
I am eight.

0:10:55.160,0:10:57.420
And who is the woman beside you?

0:10:57.420,0:10:58.480
My mum.

0:10:58.480,0:11:00.400
And how are you feeling now?

0:11:00.400,0:11:03.140
Good. I am happy to be home.

0:11:03.140,0:11:08.080
Wow! We rejoice with you that you are back home and we thank God Almighty.

0:11:08.080,0:11:12.360
We know that the best is yet to come in your lives, in Jesus' name.

0:11:12.360,0:11:17.580
The only advice I have for parents who are experiencing what I have passed through

0:11:17.580,0:11:21.800
is that with God, all things are possible, in Jesus' name.

0:11:21.800,0:11:26.020
Amen! Indeed, with God Almighty, all things are possible.

0:11:26.020,0:11:30.240
He is the final authority, answering all questions and settling all issues.

0:11:30.240,0:11:34.300
And we know that as He has settled your issues, He will also settle theirs in Jesus' name.

0:11:34.300,0:11:35.220
Amen!

0:11:35.220,0:11:38.980
We rejoice with you once again for what God Almighty has done in your life.

0:11:38.980,0:11:42.760
Prophet T.B.Joshua, seeing what you have been through in the past -

0:11:42.760,0:11:46.040
just like you explained, you were devastated, you were disturbed,

0:11:46.040,0:11:53.160
like every mother would be - the man of God has sent us on behalf of himself and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:11:53.160,0:11:58.840
He is blessing you with a sum of 150 000 Naira for the upkeep of your son.

0:11:58.840,0:12:03.060
We know that the good Lord who has started His work in your life will definitely complete it

0:12:03.060,0:12:05.820
and we know that the best is yet to come.

0:12:05.820,0:12:08.860
All you need to do is continue to walk in the light of God

0:12:08.860,0:12:14.340
and train up this child in the way of God so that as he grows up, he will not depart from it, in Jesus' name.

0:12:14.340,0:12:19.220
Amen! I was not expecting this from the man of God, truly.

0:12:19.220,0:12:29.140
I want to use this opportunity to thank the man of God for the gift of money and the Mirror book.

0:12:29.140,0:12:38.800
I also want to thank the man of God for his kindness, his assistance

0:12:38.800,0:12:46.340
and all the role he played during the time I ran down to The SCOAN for this help.

0:12:46.340,0:12:52.760
I also want to thank the man of God for the $1000 he gave to me when I came.

0:12:52.760,0:12:58.700
I am truly blessed with all the money he gave to me.

0:12:58.700,0:13:02.060
I am truly blessed. Thank you, man of God, for these gifts.

0:13:02.060,0:13:07.240
Thank you for giving attention to me and for all your help and assistance.

0:13:07.240,0:13:10.980
Thank you! Thank you so much, man of God, thank you!

0:13:10.980,0:13:14.900
We thank God Almighty. Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.

0:13:14.900,0:13:18.980
We believe that many more testimonies are to come from your family, in Jesus' name.

0:13:18.980,0:13:20.080
