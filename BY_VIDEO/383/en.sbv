Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:05.000,0:00:11.200
If God be for us, who can be against us? Nobody!

0:00:11.200,0:00:12.260
Thank you.

0:00:12.260,0:00:17.840
Let's look at 2 Corinthians 12 about Apostle Paul.

0:00:17.840,0:00:21.600
and I will take the reading from verse 7.

0:00:21.600,0:00:36.200
"And lest I be exalted above measure, by the abundance of the revelations,

0:00:36.200,0:00:46.540
a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of satan to buffet me."

0:00:46.540,0:00:48.020
Verse 8.

0:00:48.020,0:00:54.060
"Concerning this thing, I pleaded with the Lord three times

0:00:54.060,0:00:59.600
that it might depart from me."

0:00:59.600,0:01:00.940
Verse 9.

0:01:00.940,0:01:08.400
"And He said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you.

0:01:08.400,0:01:16.280
For my strength is made perfect in weakness'.

0:01:16.280,0:01:24.560
Therefore, most gladly, I would rather boast in my infirmities

0:01:24.560,0:01:27.820
that the power of Christ may rest upon me."

0:01:27.820,0:01:29.380
Let's stop here.

0:01:29.380,0:01:44.040
In this text now, Paul knew that his challenges were to correct him from being proud.

0:01:44.040,0:01:47.660
You know, when you read down, you will see 'conceited'.

0:01:47.660,0:01:52.620
He knew his challenges were to correct him.

0:01:52.620,0:02:01.620
Some of the reasons we look back is because of the mistakes or pain of the past.

0:02:01.620,0:02:06.140
Paul knew that his challenges...

0:02:06.140,0:02:13.240
When we say 'challenges', it could be of sickness, poverty, hardship,

0:02:13.240,0:02:23.780
backwardness, limitation in progress or any foolish thing.

0:02:23.780,0:02:42.880
Paul knew his challenges were to correct him from being proud or conceited.

0:02:42.880,0:02:47.020
In that text, when you read down, from the beginning to the end,

0:02:47.020,0:03:00.080
Paul knew his challenges were to correct him from being proud or conceited.

0:03:00.080,0:03:04.740
That was why he was not offended;

0:03:04.740,0:03:11.060
that was why he did not look at God in a bad light.

0:03:11.060,0:03:17.460
Like many of us - "I pay my tithe; I go to church."

0:03:17.460,0:03:24.280
Tell your neighbour, Don't give up when God corrects you.

0:03:24.280,0:03:25.580
I can't hear you.

0:03:25.580,0:03:32.300
Don't give up when God corrects you.

0:03:32.300,0:03:39.840
Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.

0:03:39.840,0:03:46.160
As if somebody says, "Please come here! Why should you do this? It is wrong!"

0:03:46.160,0:03:48.460
You say, "Why should this man shout on me like this?"

0:03:48.460,0:03:53.940
No, no, no! He loves you.

0:03:53.940,0:03:58.800
The more that correction, the more your greatness.

0:03:58.800,0:04:04.440
Be encouraged when God corrects you.

0:04:04.440,0:04:11.200
Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.

0:04:11.200,0:04:18.960
Tell your neighbour: Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.

0:04:18.960,0:04:30.320
Paul knew that his challenges - the thorn in his flesh - were to correct him

0:04:30.320,0:04:36.980
from being proud, arrogant and conceited.

0:04:36.980,0:04:41.700
Whatever you are facing,

0:04:41.700,0:04:49.000
whatever your challenges are as a Christian -

0:04:49.000,0:04:51.180
it could be poverty, this or that.

0:04:51.180,0:04:58.600
You can be sick; your sickness is not like others' but for the glory of God.

0:04:58.600,0:05:01.280
Others' sickness is to kill them, destroy them

0:05:01.280,0:05:07.540
but our own is to reform us for a better position,

0:05:07.540,0:05:13.560
to keep us for a new level in life.

0:05:13.560,0:05:29.260
Whatever you are facing - it could be poverty or whatever - as a Christian is a way of correction.

0:05:29.260,0:05:31.060
Tell your neighbour.

0:05:31.060,0:05:40.900
Whatever situation you are facing, whatever your challenges are

0:05:40.900,0:05:51.120
as a Christian, are a way of correction.

0:05:51.120,0:05:58.320
Your challenges are not meant to destroy you.

0:05:58.320,0:06:07.500
Your challenges may be to reform you for a better position.

0:06:07.500,0:06:15.560
Your challenges may be to keep you for a new level in life.

0:06:15.560,0:06:22.880
Your challenges may be to strengthen your desire for God.

0:06:22.880,0:06:26.780
What are your challenges?

0:06:26.780,0:06:36.000
Tell your neighbour: See your challenges as a reason for believing God

0:06:36.000,0:06:40.220
just as you see your good times.

0:06:40.220,0:06:48.680
See your challenges as a reason for believing God

0:06:48.680,0:06:53.340
just as you see your good times.

0:06:53.340,0:06:56.420
In your good times, you dance and say, "Thank You, Jesus!".

0:06:56.420,0:07:08.080
So when that hard time comes too, "Thank You, Jesus!".

0:07:08.080,0:07:14.720
Paul saw his challenges, the thorn in his flesh,

0:07:14.720,0:07:23.300
as a reason for believing God just as he did in his good times.

0:07:23.300,0:07:28.800
That is why he went to God three times.

0:07:28.800,0:07:35.240
Each time the Lord said, "My grace is suffient for you", and he did not give up.

0:07:35.240,0:07:40.220
Another time the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you".

0:07:40.220,0:07:42.360
Another time...

0:07:42.360,0:07:46.200
Each time is equal to hundred times.

0:07:46.200,0:07:50.000
For summary, one time is equal to hundred times,

0:07:50.000,0:07:57.800
two times - 200 times, three times - 300 times.

0:07:57.800,0:08:05.720
Job saw his challenges as a reason for believing God

0:08:05.720,0:08:10.260
just as he did in his good times.

0:08:10.260,0:08:17.320
Be encouraged when you are corrected by God.

0:08:17.320,0:08:18.580
Tell your neighbour.

0:08:18.580,0:08:21.460
Be encouraged when you are corrected by God.

0:08:21.460,0:08:22.900
I can't hear you.

0:08:22.900,0:08:26.200
Be encouraged when you are corrected by God.

0:08:26.200,0:08:33.500
Don't give up when God corrects you.

0:08:33.500,0:08:40.280
Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.

0:08:40.280,0:08:41.540
Thank you.

0:08:47.900,0:08:51.060
Hallelujah.

0:08:51.060,0:08:57.260
Honour God just as you honour Him in your good times -

0:08:57.260,0:09:03.460
honour Him in your situation.

0:09:03.460,0:09:11.560
Jesus must be honoured

0:09:11.560,0:09:17.580
Jesus must be honoured in my life

0:09:17.580,0:09:22.620
Every day

0:09:22.620,0:09:33.220
Jesus must be honoured

0:09:33.220,0:09:40.660
Jesus must be honoured in my life

0:09:40.660,0:09:46.160
Every day

0:09:46.160,0:09:49.780
If Jesus must be honoured every day,

0:09:49.780,0:09:55.480
remember our spiritual walk with the Lord -

0:09:55.480,0:09:59.700
good and hard times.

0:09:59.700,0:10:09.580
Jesus must be honoured

0:10:09.580,0:10:17.260
Jesus must be honoured in my life

0:10:17.260,0:10:21.900
Every day

0:10:21.900,0:10:33.240
Jesus must be honoured

0:10:33.240,0:10:41.700
Jesus must be honoured in my life

0:10:41.700,0:10:46.400
Every day

0:10:46.400,0:10:52.800
Remain silent and think about your life.

0:10:52.800,0:10:55.760
This is the hindrance you are having.

0:10:55.760,0:11:00.500
Your belief, once you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour -

0:11:00.500,0:11:03.940
bed of roses.

0:11:03.940,0:11:09.960
So right now, think about your life.

0:11:09.960,0:11:15.540
Christianity is all about 'relationship'.

0:11:15.540,0:11:20.580
We are not religious people; we are Christians.

0:11:20.580,0:11:26.200
If you must be a Christian, you must be ready for this relationship.

0:11:26.200,0:11:31.420
Our relationship with Christ is in both good and hard times.

0:11:31.420,0:11:35.680
Christianity is all about 'relationship'.

0:11:35.680,0:11:40.500
It is different from religion.

0:11:40.500,0:11:44.040
Religious people, when they are facing hard times,

0:11:44.040,0:11:46.140
they lament, they murmur.

0:11:46.140,0:11:49.220
They begin to see God in a bad light.

0:11:49.220,0:11:52.780
That is religious people.

0:11:52.780,0:12:02.580
But we Christians, we see our challenges as a reason for believing in God,

0:12:02.580,0:12:06.520
just as we see our good times.

0:12:06.520,0:12:14.920
Christians seek not yet repose

0:12:14.920,0:12:24.080
Hear thy guardian angel say

0:12:24.080,0:12:32.980
Thou art in the midst of foes

0:12:32.980,0:12:41.620
Watch and pray

0:12:41.620,0:12:50.960
Christians seek not yet repose

0:12:50.960,0:13:00.360
Hear thy guardian angel say

0:13:00.360,0:13:09.440
Thou art in the midst of foes

0:13:09.440,0:13:19.240
Watch and pray

0:13:19.240,0:13:21.860
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:13:21.860,0:13:27.780
