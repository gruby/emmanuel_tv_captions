0:00:08.360,0:00:12.120
We want to tell the viewers all over the world,

0:00:12.120,0:00:17.460
I mean those who are under the influence of our voice,

0:00:17.460,0:00:23.580
we know your desire and your determination.

0:00:23.580,0:00:27.040
Jesus loves you.

0:00:27.040,0:00:30.080
We salute your time.

0:00:30.080,0:00:33.260
We Christians, our time is our faith.

0:00:33.260,0:00:37.060
Tell your neighbour, 'My time is my faith'.

0:00:37.060,0:00:40.760
'My faith is my time'.

0:00:40.760,0:00:46.760
Viewers, with God, all things are possible.

0:00:46.760,0:00:51.520
We know there are many viewers that are on the sickbed.

0:00:51.520,0:00:57.520
They have been with us since morning while they are lying on the sickbed.

0:00:57.520,0:01:03.740
I want to tell you, it is time to receive.

0:01:03.740,0:01:06.520
Distance is not a barrier.

0:01:06.520,0:01:10.600
Whatever condition, whatever situation you are in,

0:01:10.600,0:01:14.320
whatever name they call it -

0:01:14.320,0:01:18.320
never a sickness Jesus cannot heal,

0:01:18.320,0:01:21.820
never a burden Jesus cannot bear

0:01:21.820,0:01:25.040
and never a problem Jesus cannot solve.

0:01:25.040,0:01:28.460
Right now, be with me; I am with you.

0:01:28.460,0:01:33.720
This is a question of the heart.

0:01:33.720,0:01:35.000
Heart-to-heart.

0:01:35.000,0:01:38.160
Let someone say, 'Heart-to-heart'.

0:01:38.160,0:01:40.920
Because faith is of man's heart.

0:01:40.920,0:01:46.600
Your 'Amen' may not come from your heart, your attention may not come from your heart

0:01:46.600,0:01:51.620
but I'm telling you, this is a question of the heart.

0:01:51.620,0:01:54.000
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

Viewers, whatever means satan might have used to cage you...

0:02:06.980,0:02:12.140
There are many means satan can use to cage one -

0:02:12.140,0:02:18.120
affliction, setback, depression, rejection.

0:02:18.120,0:02:26.520

There are many people that are in a cage.

0:03:18.220,0:03:28.020
You will see them moving, but they are in a cage.

0:03:28.020,0:03:34.400
It is not only those who are in the prison that are in a cage.

0:03:34.400,0:03:40.900
The most serious cage is for one to be moving around and yet, he is in a cage.

0:03:40.900,0:03:47.940
