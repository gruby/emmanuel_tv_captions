0:00:00.000,0:00:05.040
Prophet T.B. Joshua, walking in the spirit, ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ

0:00:05.040,0:00:10.140
and every mountain in the lives of the people that are standing between them and God's promises

0:00:10.140,0:00:13.040
are removed in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:00:13.040,0:00:17.180
Demons are the cause of the enormous growth of pain all over the world

0:00:17.180,0:00:21.020
but at the mention of that 
name Jesus Christ, they have to bow.

0:00:21.020,0:00:26.500
As Prophet T.B. Joshua moved along the line, he encountered this woman possessing a demon

0:00:26.500,0:00:31.240
and she began to react uncontrollably as the Holy Spirit's fire arrested her.

0:00:31.240,0:00:32.700
Lets watch.

0:00:32.700,0:00:35.440
I made her to become a prostitute.

0:00:35.440,0:00:38.100
Who are you in this body?

0:00:38.100,0:00:44.600
Right now speaking, I am the marine spirit.

0:00:44.600,0:00:45.840
Who else is in this body?

0:00:45.840,0:00:57.580
I am the spiritual husband, spirit of anger, 
marine spirit and spirit of lust.

0:00:57.580,0:00:59.120
What have you done to her?

0:00:59.120,0:01:00.740
I have destroyed her.

0:01:00.740,0:01:01.820
How?

0:01:01.820,0:01:04.340
I have made her to become a prostitute.

0:01:04.340,0:01:08.480
What have you done to her family?

0:01:08.480,0:01:11.380
We have made her family suffer so much.

0:01:11.380,0:01:14.460
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:14.460,0:01:15.540
How did you enter her?

0:01:15.540,0:01:19.020
When she first went to America.

0:01:19.020,0:01:24.580
Prophet T.B. Joshua commands the evil spirits out of her body in Jesus' name, and she is free.

0:01:24.580,0:01:28.740
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:28.740,0:01:33.880
My name is Debra Kataro and the woman standing beside me is my mother.

0:01:33.880,0:01:36.260
I'm from Togo.

0:01:36.260,0:01:40.540
Five years back, we went to America from Togo.

0:01:40.540,0:01:44.840
When we got there, when I came out of the airport,

0:01:44.840,0:01:50.260
this kind of like a hot air hit my face.

0:01:50.260,0:01:56.160
Nobody else felt it, but I felt it;
 I was 9 years old then.

0:01:56.160,0:01:58.040
We came out of the airport.

0:01:58.040,0:02:02.360
I grew up in America and I started going to school.

0:02:02.360,0:02:06.160
So as I moved to the higher class - sixth grade,

0:02:06.160,0:02:11.860
I had a friend who was doing prostitution - sleeping with men for money.

0:02:11.860,0:02:17.820
And then she asked me if I was ready to live the kind of life that she was living.

0:02:17.820,0:02:22.040
I didn't know anything so I said, "Yeah!"

0:02:22.040,0:02:24.020
So then I started doing it.

0:02:24.020,0:02:30.600
Also whilst I was growing up, in school I used to get angry really quick;

0:02:30.600,0:02:33.400
like if I didn't see blood, I wouldn't leave the person.

0:02:33.400,0:02:36.640
I had to see blood before I left the person alone.

0:02:36.640,0:02:41.500
The school found out and placed me 
in foster care.

0:02:41.500,0:02:46.320
If you're in foster care, it means 
that you're sleeping at an improper age,

0:02:46.320,0:02:52.500
and at that time I was like around 10 - 11 years old and I was sleeping with men for money,

0:02:52.500,0:02:55.620
prostituting with my friends for money.

0:02:55.620,0:03:01.560
Meanwhile, whilst I was doing this, my mum didn't know anything about it.

0:03:01.560,0:03:05.160
Only I and my friends knew about it in the school.

0:03:05.160,0:03:08.120
So what happened after your first meeting with your friend,

0:03:08.120,0:03:10.740
when she introduced you into prostitution?

0:03:10.740,0:03:15.680
I started doing it - I started doing the same thing she was doing.

0:03:15.680,0:03:19.840
The prostitution job that she was doing.

0:03:19.840,0:03:21.480
So how did you go about it?

0:03:21.480,0:03:25.500
How did she teach you to go about
 doing prostitution at that young age?

0:03:25.500,0:03:30.440
She taught me how I was supposed
to dress if I wanted to attract men.

0:03:30.440,0:03:34.220
It was in school that she was teaching me everything.

0:03:34.220,0:03:38.660
Okay, and so once she taught you
how to dress and how to attract men,

0:03:38.660,0:03:43.080
where did you now go to practice
the prostitution that you had learned?}

0:03:43.080,0:03:46.180
Well, in the streets.

0:03:46.180,0:03:51.860
So how many men a day did this prostitution lead you to be sleeping with at that age?

0:03:51.860,0:03:54.060
Two, three, most four.

0:03:54.060,0:03:57.340
In school also, I fought.

0:03:57.340,0:04:01.860
I beat the teachers, the students, 
anybody that got me angry.

0:04:01.860,0:04:03.760
I would fight them.

0:04:03.760,0:04:09.540
And at home - it took
 me away from my parents.

0:04:09.540,0:04:16.680
Those two years that I spent in foster care, I should have spent it with my mother and father,

0:04:16.680,0:04:20.760
and it just took me away from them.

0:04:20.760,0:04:27.620
Because of me, they deported 
my family from America back to Togo.

0:04:27.620,0:04:33.440
My mom is a diplomat and she went to work in America.

0:04:33.440,0:04:39.520
But because of me, they told all of us to go back to Africa.

0:04:39.520,0:04:43.900
And when we came back to Africa, I started doing the same thing which is prostituting,

0:04:43.900,0:04:47.180
going out at night, sleeping with men, drinking.

0:04:47.180,0:04:50.380
Sometimes, I would even sleep at my friend's house,

0:04:50.380,0:04:54.640
not even coming back home until the next morning.

0:04:54.640,0:04:56.880
My mother did not know anything about it

0:04:56.880,0:05:00.100
because when I came back home,
I would tell her I didn't do anything.

0:05:00.100,0:05:05.740
She would usually call me a prostitute,
and that would get me really angry.

0:05:05.740,0:05:09.860
One night, I came back home with shoes that my friends and I had bought.

0:05:09.860,0:05:19.500
I came back home with those shoes.

0:05:19.500,0:05:21.740
When I came home, they started calling me names,

0:05:21.740,0:05:23.520
and I said, "I'm going out, I'm leaving!"

0:05:23.520,0:05:29.280
I left and I came the next day at night,
at around 10 o'clock.

0:05:29.280,0:05:34.580
When I came back inside the house, my mother didn't call me right away.

0:05:34.580,0:05:40.380
But as I was watching TV, she called me and I went.

0:05:40.380,0:05:45.100
I wasn't really thinking that she was going to say anything bad to me.

0:05:45.100,0:05:47.600
So when I came out, she asked, 
"Where did you come from?"

0:05:47.600,0:05:50.700
I said, "I'm not telling you, why 
do you want to know?"

0:05:50.700,0:05:54.600
Then she asked me, "Those shoes that you bought, where did you get those shoes from?"

0:05:54.600,0:05:57.300
I said, "My friends and I went out and bought them.

0:05:57.300,0:05:59.880
We had just got some money,
 and we went and bought it".

0:05:59.880,0:06:04.120
She said, "Your friends and you did not do anything like that.

0:06:04.120,0:06:06.840
You went to do prostitution and bought the shoes".

0:06:06.840,0:06:09.080
I said, "That's not what happened; you don't know".

0:06:09.080,0:06:10.640
And then she told me to go on my knees,

0:06:10.640,0:06:12.720
I said," I'm not going on my knees."

0:06:12.720,0:06:14.540
So then my grandmother came out and said

0:06:14.540,0:06:17.840
that she was going to take the shoes
away from me and cut them in pieces.

0:06:17.840,0:06:20.660
I said, "It's not going to happen" and I just took the shoes away from her.

0:06:20.660,0:06:22.200
I pushed her; she fell on the floor.

0:06:22.200,0:06:23.600
I said that she could stay there.

0:06:23.600,0:06:27.640
My mother started talking to me but I wasn't really minding her.

0:06:27.640,0:06:32.520
I was on one side and telling her, "See how your life is going; nothing is happening!"

0:06:32.520,0:06:38.860
And then she started saying 
things but I wasn't really minding her.

0:06:38.860,0:06:41.320
I went inside the room, I wanted to sleep.

0:06:41.320,0:06:42.580
We sleep in the same room.

0:06:42.580,0:06:44.060
And then she told me, "Get out of the room!"

0:06:44.060,0:06:46.660
I said, "I want to get something 
from the room, please".

0:06:46.660,0:06:48.480
She told me, "Get out!"

0:06:48.480,0:06:51.960
So as I was getting out, I put the shoes next to the door.

0:06:51.960,0:06:54.200
She threw my shoes outside the door.

0:06:54.200,0:06:56.540
I said, "What are you doing, you b****?"

0:06:56.540,0:07:03.260
So we can really see how this spirit of prostitution had destroyed her life

0:07:03.260,0:07:05.240
and affected her family.

0:07:05.240,0:07:09.700
Not least of all, her mother who was having a very important job in the United States,

0:07:09.700,0:07:14.140
the whole family had to be sent back to Togo because of this atmosphere,

0:07:14.140,0:07:19.540
and how she was affected among her relatives, even the grandmother.

0:07:19.540,0:07:23.060
So tell us - at that time, what was
 happening to your spiritual life?

0:07:23.060,0:07:24.780
What kind of dreams were you having,

0:07:24.780,0:07:28.120
that continued to push you on 
from one point to the next?

0:07:28.120,0:07:36.320
Okay. In my dreams, I usually saw myself wearing a crown, like being a princess.

0:07:36.320,0:07:41.660
And a lady - there would be men
 passing and the lady would actually come near me

0:07:41.660,0:07:44.700
and tell me, "This man, you have to go after him".

0:07:44.700,0:07:48.640
She showed me which man 
I was going to go after the next morning.

0:07:48.640,0:07:52.780
When I woke up in the morning, the people that I saw in my dreams

0:07:52.780,0:08:00.100
would be the people that I would actually see in real life like this, and they went after me.

0:08:00.100,0:08:04.400
And they would the people that you would then sleep with as you were practicing this prostitution

0:08:04.400,0:08:05.280
Yeah,

0:08:05.280,0:08:08.200
So tell us, how did you go about
it at that very young age?

0:08:08.200,0:08:10.340
How were you able to get these 
people?

0:08:10.340,0:08:14.460
What powers or what skills were you able to use in order to attract them?

0:08:14.460,0:08:22.540
I have beads that show that.

0:08:22.540,0:08:26.600
Okay, so what are these beads
we are seeing in your hands now?

0:08:26.600,0:08:29.220
The blue one - my friend gave it to me;

0:08:29.220,0:08:32.060
the one that did the same thing with me.

0:08:32.060,0:08:34.880
These three - I bought them myself.

0:08:34.880,0:08:38.560
Okay, so what is the function of
these beads? What were they doing?

0:08:38.560,0:08:43.440
Like when they saw this - sometimes,
I would dress inappropriately,

0:08:43.440,0:08:46.380
I would wear something short that came up to here.

0:08:46.380,0:08:50.720
Sometimes up to here, 
so that they would to be able to see it.

0:08:50.720,0:08:52.920
So when they saw it -

0:08:52.920,0:08:57.480
when I walked past you and you would see it, you would go after me.

0:08:57.480,0:09:00.580
You couldn't resist me, you had to go after me.

0:09:00.580,0:09:04.600
So basically this was what gave you the power of seduction to seduce the men

0:09:04.600,0:09:08.880
they showed you in the dream, in order to continue with that prostitution, is that right?

0:09:08.880,0:09:10.260
Yeah!

0:09:10.260,0:09:13.760
Even so with this power, that ability and the dreams you've been having,

0:09:13.760,0:09:15.420
as a young person at that time,

0:09:15.420,0:09:18.920
how were you able to go to the places where you would get the men

0:09:18.920,0:09:23.860
you had seen in the dream or that you would later entice with these powers?

0:09:23.860,0:09:26.020
My fake ID card.

0:09:26.020,0:09:32.940
Whilst we were in America, I had a fake ID card that said that I was 21 years old,

0:09:32.940,0:09:37.560
which allowed me to go out to clubs and have fun with my friends.

0:09:37.560,0:09:40.280
Meanwhile, I was not 21.

0:09:40.280,0:09:42.260
How old were you at at that time?

0:09:42.260,0:09:46.020
When I had it, I was around 12.

0:09:46.020,0:09:52.620
So our sister was around 12 years old and she had an ID card - a fake, a forged ID card -

0:09:52.620,0:09:58.500
that said she was 21 which allowed her access to go to all the nightclubs and different places

0:09:58.500,0:10:04.080
where she would go to practice prostitution to seduce and sleep with men.

0:10:04.080,0:10:07.800
If you go to my Facebook 
page, all you will see is men.

0:10:07.800,0:10:12.580
So many men - some would 
ask me where I lived.

0:10:12.580,0:10:16.960
Sometimes I would lie and say that I live at the same place where they were living,

0:10:16.960,0:10:21.820
give them fake appointments to
meet me at the restaurant.

0:10:21.820,0:10:25.920
I remember this Nigerian guy - he's on on my Facebook -

0:10:25.920,0:10:30.180
and he told me I should come to Nigeria and marry him.

0:10:30.180,0:10:34.400
So we understand that that was the next stage that this spirit pushed you to -

0:10:34.400,0:10:37.220
going onto the internet and different social media.

0:10:37.220,0:10:42.700
So what kind of men would you normally target or which ones wouldnormally choose you?

0:10:42.700,0:10:45.280
Grown-ups, married men.

0:10:45.280,0:10:51.120
Sometimes, when I slept with them, 
if there were successful in life,

0:10:51.120,0:10:54.920
everything that they had would be like broken.

0:10:54.920,0:10:59.200
There would be nothing. If they had 
money like really a lot of money.

0:10:59.200,0:11:03.800
in two days, there would be no more money.

0:11:03.800,0:11:07.640
So can you tell us any big experience or any specific occurrence

0:11:07.640,0:11:11.220
you really remember that,  "Ah! I know this has happened".

0:11:11.220,0:11:17.500
Well, one time I remember when I slept with this married man, he came to me the next day

0:11:17.500,0:11:22.340
and told me that I destroyed everything between him and his wife;

0:11:22.340,0:11:27.120
and said why I did that, why he slept with me in the first place,

0:11:27.120,0:11:32.780
why I go out for men. He started calling me names, and I really didn't mind it.

0:11:32.780,0:11:38.760
So basically that power within you had given you the ability to seduce and destroy men at this time,

0:11:38.760,0:11:39.900
that was what was happening?

0:11:39.900,0:11:41.540
Yeah.

0:11:41.540,0:11:46.540
Okay, so tell us now, what was it that now let to your coming to The SCOAN

0:11:46.540,0:11:50.760
where you received your deliverance 
from this demonic spirit?

0:11:50.760,0:11:57.320
At first I really did not like Emmanuel TV, the anointed sticker, the anointed water

0:11:57.320,0:12:01.240
because when I saw Emmanuel TV, it was like though I should break the TV.

0:12:01.240,0:12:04.200
When I saw the sticker, I couldn't stand the sticker.

0:12:04.200,0:12:06.080
I couldn't stay next to the sticker.

0:12:06.080,0:12:09.240
Sometimes my mother would tease 
me and put the anointing water on me

0:12:09.240,0:12:10.560
and I really didn't like that.

0:12:10.560,0:12:14.840
It did something to me when she did it. It got me so angry.

0:12:14.840,0:12:21.380
I couldn't stay next to you, when you had the anointing water, the sticker or watching the TV.

0:12:21.380,0:12:25.400
I couldn't stay next to you, 
I had to get away from you.

0:12:25.400,0:12:31.640
Wow! So how did that now lead you to come to The SCOAN where you received your deliverance?

0:12:31.640,0:12:34.760
We went someplace and 
they said that we should come here.

0:12:34.760,0:12:39.640
Meanwhile, I knew that we were coming here but then I told her I was not going anymore.

0:12:39.640,0:12:43.900
The night that we were
leaving, she told me that we were going.

0:12:43.900,0:12:45.900
And that's how I came here.

0:12:45.900,0:12:49.460
So tell us - at the prayer line, what was your experience when you were there

0:12:49.460,0:12:52.580
and the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you?

0:12:52.580,0:12:55.740
I was standing there, he was praying for people.

0:12:55.740,0:13:01.000
So when he was coming near to me, I was getting very angry.

0:13:01.000,0:13:09.780
When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me, it was as though I was sleeping on one side.

0:13:09.780,0:13:14.080
All I saw was like so many
 people wearing black,

0:13:14.080,0:13:19.000
shouting that something was paining, itching, scratching them.

0:13:19.000,0:13:23.580
Meanwhile, when this light was cleansing -

0:13:23.580,0:13:28.820
the more the light cleansed, 
the more they shouted in pain.

0:13:28.820,0:13:35.920
When he touched me the second time, all those people that were wearing black disappeared

0:13:35.920,0:13:38.700
and another light was walking towards me.

0:13:38.700,0:13:43.300
Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus.

0:13:43.300,0:13:48.460
Who else can justly rescue and deliver but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

0:13:48.460,0:13:53.360
Since your deliverance, tell us how you are you feeling now and what the differences are.

0:13:53.360,0:13:55.660
I feel happy.

0:13:55.660,0:14:03.520
I'm glad that I'm delivered because I could have been dead by now, died with my sins.

0:14:03.520,0:14:06.960
I'm happy I did not die with my sins.

0:14:06.960,0:14:11.400
Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!

0:14:11.400,0:14:15.340
So tell us how you have been sleeping and what your dreams are like since your deliverance.

0:14:15.340,0:14:17.040
Are you still seeing those men?

0:14:17.040,0:14:18.100
No!

0:14:18.100,0:14:20.980
Actually when I got my deliverance on that Sunday,

0:14:20.980,0:14:25.880
on Monday when I was sleeping, I saw all those people I used to see in my dreams.

0:14:25.880,0:14:30.260
They just picked up their luggage, started putting their clothes in it and left.

0:14:30.260,0:14:34.380
Ever since then, I haven't had 
those dreams, and I sleep like a baby.

0:14:34.380,0:14:39.640
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:14:39.640,0:14:43.060
And since then you have been 
in The SCOAN.

0:14:43.060,0:14:47.040
Tell us - are you still having the urge for men, the spirit of lust

0:14:47.040,0:14:49.500
or the desire to sleep with men for money?

0:14:49.500,0:14:50.960
No.

0:14:50.960,0:14:53.820
Okay, tell us how you feel.

0:14:53.820,0:14:59.400
I feel free. Now I don't feel like I have 
to wear these beads for men.

0:14:59.400,0:15:05.000
I feel like I have to grow up and get married before I do all those things and not at a young age.

0:15:05.000,0:15:08.060
I shouldn't be doing this because it's not proper.

0:15:08.060,0:15:12.940
Wow! Glory be to God! We can see what the Word of God has done in the life of our sister.

0:15:12.940,0:15:15.780
It is powerful and it has kept her pure.

0:15:15.780,0:15:17.640
We want to hear a word of advice from you.

0:15:17.640,0:15:21.200
Speak to people all over the world, especially young people like yourself

0:15:21.200,0:15:25.440
who find themselves in a similar bondage or problem that you had.

0:15:25.440,0:15:28.880
What can they do to get their way out?

0:15:28.880,0:15:32.980
They have to believe in Christ. Don't be with somebody you're not supposed to be with

0:15:32.980,0:15:40.680
and become something bad that connects satan's chain to yourself.

0:15:40.680,0:15:45.240
Just believe in Christ and 
everything will be well with you.

0:15:45.240,0:15:47.740
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:15:47.740,0:15:50.720
What a wonderful word of advice!

0:15:50.720,0:15:54.140
My name is Arisoba Hodalo.

0:15:54.140,0:15:57.640
I'm from Togo.

0:15:57.640,0:16:02.920
Thank you very much, and share with us about the testimony your daughter has given so far today.

0:16:02.920,0:16:05.940
Tell us what life was like, living with her at that time

0:16:05.940,0:16:10.940
when she was possessed with this spirit of prostitution.

0:16:10.940,0:16:17.400
I work with our foreign minister, and they sent me five years ago

0:16:17.400,0:16:25.660
to the embassy of Togo at the United Nations, and I was the assistant to the ambassador.

0:16:25.660,0:16:30.700
So I went there with my whole family.

0:16:30.700,0:16:39.440
Few years ago, I saw my daughter's character changing.

0:16:39.440,0:16:44.680
One day when I came back from work, I saw her with three men.

0:16:44.680,0:16:52.340
I was so shocked; three men 
with condoms in my own bed.

0:16:52.340,0:16:55.600
And then, that is when I talked to her.

0:16:55.600,0:16:59.660
She changed; I couldn't bear her character.

0:16:59.660,0:17:04.880
She insulted me; she couldn't listen at school and at home.

0:17:04.880,0:17:09.480
In our street, everywhere -  nobody could bear her.

0:17:09.480,0:17:11.840
You couldn't stand in front of her.

0:17:11.840,0:17:18.560
This was when the two governments - the government of America and the Togolese government -

0:17:18.560,0:17:22.260
decided to send us back home.

0:17:22.260,0:17:25.140
Okay, they sent you back home because they were aware of this case,

0:17:25.140,0:17:27.000
they were aware of what was happening.

0:17:27.000,0:17:33.940
Yes, because one day she left and the government of America used their airplanes

0:17:33.940,0:17:36.480
and the police to look for her.

0:17:36.480,0:17:41.140
They couldn't bear her, they asked 
us to leave the United States.

0:17:41.140,0:17:44.700
So just to recap, for the benefit 
of our viewers all over the world,

0:17:44.700,0:17:48.200
you heard our mother introducing herself as a minister

0:17:48.200,0:17:51.220
that was sent on behalf of the government of Togo

0:17:51.220,0:17:55.020
to work in the embassy in the United States of America.

0:17:55.020,0:18:00.740
It was while she was there five years ago that she noticed changes coming over her daughter.

0:18:00.740,0:18:05.200
Her daughter became rude and argumentative, and no one could talk to her.

0:18:05.200,0:18:08.060
Until one day to her horror, when she came home,

0:18:08.060,0:18:12.740
she discovered her daughter in her bedroom with three men with condoms,

0:18:12.740,0:18:14.880
committing this act of prostitution.

0:18:14.880,0:18:19.140
That's when she really got to know that there was a serious problem on the way

0:18:19.140,0:18:23.540
and she later went on to say how this problem had affected her career

0:18:23.540,0:18:29.620
in that she was taken back from where she was sent on mission to the United States of America.

0:18:29.620,0:18:34.900
Her whole family was sent back to Togo, just because of this issue.

0:18:34.900,0:18:37.440
She told us how her daughter had gone missing,

0:18:37.440,0:18:40.440
to the extent that the government and the police had to intervene,

0:18:40.440,0:18:44.180
in order to help her find her daughter and bring her back home.

0:18:44.180,0:18:47.860
So after you came back to Togo from the United States of America,

0:18:47.860,0:18:52.120
did this attitude still continue? What was life like living with her?

0:18:52.120,0:18:54.580
Yes, she did the same thing.

0:18:54.580,0:19:02.320
One of my friends introduced me to Emmanuel TV and we used to watch it.

0:19:02.320,0:19:06.280
Okay, just before we get to Emmanuel TV, we once again want to hear from you.

0:19:06.280,0:19:11.080
What was the age of your daughter when you noticed these changes in America started taking place,

0:19:11.080,0:19:15.180
that she started misbehaving and going into prostitution?

0:19:15.180,0:19:18.540
Between 10 and 11.

0:19:18.540,0:19:19.900
Yes.

0:19:19.900,0:19:23.200
Okay, so when you discovered Emmanuel TV,

0:19:23.200,0:19:28.500
and you started trying to get your daughter to watch it, what was her reaction like?

0:19:28.500,0:19:34.220
She used to say, "Oh! Mummy, you are wasting your time.

0:19:34.220,0:19:38.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua is a fake man, don't listen to him".

0:19:38.060,0:19:41.940
She always run away from the TV.

0:19:41.940,0:19:46.180
What was it that now encouraged you and made you believe that if you came here with your daughter,

0:19:46.180,0:19:48.960
she could receive her deliverance from this problem?

0:19:48.960,0:19:59.740
Because I believe God will never fail and when I used to watch Emmanuel TV, my faith grew.

0:19:59.740,0:20:03.720
And I knew that when I get here, she will be delivered.

0:20:03.720,0:20:08.960
Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:08.960,0:20:13.560
So when you were with your daughter at the prayer line and you saw the man of God praying for her,

0:20:13.560,0:20:17.300
and indeed the deliverance you had been longing for was finally taking place,

0:20:17.300,0:20:18.920
how were you feeling?

0:20:18.920,0:20:24.040
I felt so happy and I cried of joy.

0:20:24.040,0:20:28.960
Thank You, Jesus!

0:20:28.960,0:20:31.080
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:20:31.080,0:20:36.540
There are not enough natural words to say other than "Thank You, Lord, for this wonderful deliverance".

0:20:36.540,0:20:41.640
So tell us, before we hear about how she has changed after the prayer line,

0:20:41.640,0:20:45.000
what were some of the efforts you and your family had gone through

0:20:45.000,0:20:49.840
to get her delivered or free from this problem before you came here?

0:20:49.840,0:20:56.840
Actually, we just prayed; we didn't go anywhere.

0:20:56.840,0:21:01.320
Hallelujah. So since the deliverance at the prayer line through Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:21:01.320,0:21:06.860
tell us - what have been the changes and the differences you've noticed in the life of your daughter?

0:21:06.860,0:21:09.200
Hallelujah!

0:21:09.200,0:21:15.980
I thank God because when I saw her wearing this, she couldn't wear this before.

0:21:15.980,0:21:21.020
Even when she wanted to go to church, she would wear - I don't know.

0:21:21.020,0:21:25.500
I thank God, I don't have much to say,

0:21:25.500,0:21:28.780
I couldn't send her to do something
 in the house,

0:21:28.780,0:21:32.280
She refused everything I asked her to do.

0:21:32.280,0:21:41.200
But after her deliverance, I sent her, and she went and did it with joy. I thank God!

0:21:41.200,0:21:47.380
Hallelujah. We can see she's a changed person. The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

0:21:47.380,0:21:51.740
Lastly, please give us your word of advice to people all over the world

0:21:51.740,0:21:56.500
who may be suffering from a similar problem that your family had in this instance.

0:21:56.500,0:22:05.020
My advice goes like this: To all the mothers, put your faith in God.

0:22:05.020,0:22:08.000
Nobody can help you, only God.

0:22:08.020,0:22:13.340
Love your children despite their characters.

0:22:13.340,0:22:18.880
Love them and try to talk to them.

0:22:18.880,0:22:21.100
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:22:21.100,0:22:24.118
Our mother is advising people all over the world that

0:22:24.120,0:22:27.580
the most important thing is their relationship with God.

0:22:27.580,0:22:32.800
Once you have established a firm relationship with God, the blessings, the miracles,

0:22:32.800,0:22:35.920
the protection and everything we need to live for him here and now

0:22:35.920,0:22:38.120
will continue to follow us and abide with us.

0:22:38.120,0:22:41.520
We thank God Almighty for 
this wonderful testimony and this deliverance.

0:22:41.520,0:22:45.780
And we encourage you to maintain it by making God's Word the standard for your life.

0:22:45.780,0:22:52.760
Let love lead you and lead you on to better, and the best is yet to come for you, in Jesus' name.

0:22:52.760,0:22:55.040
Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
