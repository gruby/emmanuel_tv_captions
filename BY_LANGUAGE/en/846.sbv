Kim Jae Sik - 69 years old

0:03:11.340,0:03:16.220
Kim Jae Sik - Seoul, South Korea

0:03:16.220,0:03:21.240
My name is Kim Jae Sik. I am 69 years old.

0:03:21.240,0:03:25.040
I am from Seoul, South Korea.

0:03:25.040,0:03:30.460
Who is the woman next to you?

0:03:30.460,0:03:34.320
She is my wife.

0:03:34.320,0:03:47.160
I came to meet Prophet T.B. Joshua because I had heart pain.

0:03:47.160,0:03:52.000
I came to this Crusade because of my heart and respiratory problem.

0:03:52.000,0:03:58.300
For how long did you have this problem?

0:03:58.300,0:04:03.560
I suffered from this problem for 20 years.

0:04:03.560,0:04:28.820
I couldn't do anything; so, my wife suffered because she always had to work hard.

0:04:28.820,0:04:35.620
If I didn't use the breathing machine, I could not breathe.

0:04:35.620,0:04:40.960
After Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I removed the oxygen mask.

0:04:40.960,0:04:44.500
Now, I can move freely.

0:04:44.500,0:04:51.300
I couldn't breathe on my own. I had to use a respirator and oxygen bottle to breathe.

0:04:51.300,0:04:53.900
After the prayer, I disconnected it.

0:04:53.900,0:04:56.820
I went to many hospitals.

0:04:56.820,0:05:02.200
I went to prayer mountains.

0:05:02.200,0:05:06.300
I went to many different places in search of a solution.

0:05:06.300,0:05:16.740
When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I removed the oxygen machine

0:05:16.740,0:05:21.380
and now I can breathe freely.

0:05:21.380,0:05:26.940
Before, I used to visit several hospitals and also prayer mountains.

0:05:26.940,0:05:30.840
But the solution was only in the Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:05:30.840,0:05:37.380
Why were you using an oxygen machine?

0:05:37.380,0:05:54.400
I couldn't breathe, so I had to use the oxygen machine to breathe.

0:05:54.400,0:06:02.980
What happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you?

0:06:02.980,0:06:19.520
My heart became light and I felt like running. So, I did.

0:06:19.520,0:06:26.360
I felt very fresh in my heart and suddenly I felt that I could walk and run now.

0:06:26.360,0:06:46.060
After removing the breathing machine, I can now move around, breathe, talk and walk freely.

0:06:46.060,0:06:50.360
I feel now very good because before, I used to use an oxygen machine

0:06:50.360,0:06:52.500
but that was very uncomfortable.

0:06:52.500,0:06:58.220
But now I don't use this so I can freely live my daily life.

0:06:58.220,0:07:10.140
What are the things you can do now to confirm that you are healed?

0:07:10.140,0:07:32.220
Before, I couldn't walk properly but now, I can walk freely and I am fine.

0:07:32.220,0:07:40.520
Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:07:40.540,0:07:53.700
Yes, now I can run and do push ups.

Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:07:55.200,0:08:01.080
Mr. Kim jumps up to the glory of God and demonstrates how he can now move freely,

0:08:01.080,0:08:04.480
and even do push ups pain-free.

0:08:04.480,0:08:07.180
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:08:07.180,0:08:12.480
Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:08:12.480,0:08:17.240
Before, I was not able to do these things but now, I am very able to do this.

0:08:17.240,0:08:27.040
I can breathe freely after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.

0:08:27.040,0:08:39.620
So, I can testify that you too will be healed if Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for you, in Jesus' name.

0:08:39.620,0:08:46.780
I want to tell you that I am healed by God who worked through Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:46.780,0:08:52.940
So, I want to tell you that you will also be healed if you get prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:52.940,0:08:56.780
God is working through him, in Jesus' name.

0:09:02.380,0:09:05.460
My name is Jeong Jin Hui. I am 53 years old.

I am from Seoul, South Korea.

Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:09:10.980,0:09:14.360
He is my husband.

0:09:14.360,0:09:20.520
Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:09:20.520,0:09:23.800
He had a heart problem and had an operation.

0:09:23.800,0:09:28.020
He was in the hospital and couldn't breathe without a breathing machine.

0:09:28.020,0:09:30.420
This was why we came to the Crusade.

0:09:30.420,0:09:33.600
My husband had a heart surgery,

0:09:33.600,0:09:38.780
and he couldn't breathe well without a respirator and oxygen bottles.

0:09:38.780,0:09:48.120
Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:09:48.120,0:09:54.920
I felt bad seeing him not able to breathe.

0:09:54.920,0:10:00.020
I felt very sad to just look at him being sick and having a problem with his heart.

0:10:00.020,0:10:11.760
How do you feel after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for your husband?

0:10:11.760,0:10:16.240
I am very happy.

0:10:16.240,0:10:31.000
How do you feel when you see your husband breathing without any devices - respirator and oxygen bottle?

0:10:31.000,0:10:40.220
Thank You, Jesus. I want my husband to stay healthy and spread the Gospel.

0:10:40.220,0:10:46.780
I am very thankful to Jesus Christ, and I want my husband to live for spreading the Gospel.

0:10:46.780,0:10:58.600
Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus! Thank You for healing my husband.

0:10:58.620,0:11:05.940
I really want everyone to encounter Jesus Christ.

Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:11:28.140,0:11:32.420
Climbing up the winding staircase, it is difficult to believe

0:11:32.420,0:11:35.900
that Mr. Kim was once confined to a wheelchair

0:11:35.900,0:11:39.640
and unable to breathe without an oxygen machine.

0:11:39.640,0:11:44.160
Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:11:44.160,0:11:49.520
A group of visitors from Singapore who attended the crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:11:49.520,0:11:53.400
recognise Mr. Kim and rejoice with him,

0:11:53.400,0:11:56.560
giving thanks to God for his miraculous healing.

0:11:56.560,0:12:01.140
They share their experience as they remember the deplorable condition

0:12:01.140,0:12:04.620
in which Mr. Kim came to the crusade.

0:12:04.620,0:12:07.160
I am Mathew Ng from Singapore.

0:12:07.160,0:12:12.040
I am now meeting this gentleman who we first met during the crusade.

0:12:12.040,0:12:17.155
When we met him, he was very ill and we remember seeing him with tubes

0:12:17.160,0:12:19.380
all over his hands and body.

0:12:19.380,0:12:22.560
He was in a wheelchair and even used an oxygen tank.

0:12:22.560,0:12:27.760
Now, we are looking at him totally restored and healed

0:12:27.760,0:12:35.540
by the mighty power of the Lord, Jesus Christ, through Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN.

0:12:35.540,0:12:38.280
I'm just so happy!
