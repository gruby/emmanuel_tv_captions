Good Morning, Church!

I have done my own dance.

0:00:19.140,0:00:26.400
I would have shown it now, but I have been dancing since...

0:00:26.400,0:00:33.520
I was a viewer but now here I am.

I am looking forward to see when you will allow me put on a suit;

0:00:45.900,0:00:53.760
when some of your spirits will allow me to put on a suit, when we will not fight.

0:00:53.760,0:00:57.440
That is why I had to dress this way.

All I'm saying, "Allow me to wear a tie".

0:01:10.880,0:01:16.840
You will allow me one day to wear a tie.

0:01:16.840,0:01:24.060
This issue of faith.

0:01:24.060,0:01:27.260
Only faith pleases God.

0:01:27.260,0:01:31.940
It has given me so much concern.

0:01:31.940,0:01:38.640
People are not going through faith to talk to God anymore.

0:01:38.640,0:01:44.900
People imagine God hears them -

0:01:44.900,0:01:50.680
that is imagination.

0:01:50.680,0:02:07.680
To learn how to believe that God hears us when we pray is a much greater blessing

0:02:07.680,0:02:11.560
than healing and deliverance.

0:02:11.560,0:02:14.240
Just name them.

0:02:14.240,0:02:18.240
But how many of us today...?

0:02:18.240,0:02:24.900
You stand up to pray, "Lord Jesus", and you know He is hearing you, and you are hearing Him -

0:02:24.900,0:02:29.820
how many of you, how many of us today?

0:02:29.820,0:02:34.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:34.400,0:02:35.500
Tell your neighbour:

0:02:35.500,0:02:49.900
“To learn how to believe that God hears us when we pray is a much greater blessing

0:02:49.900,0:02:56.480
than healing, deliverance and whatever you are waiting for.”

0:02:56.480,0:03:11.860
It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.

0:03:11.860,0:03:15.400
Why?

0:03:15.400,0:03:24.960
Because the prayer of faith can be repeated a thousand times.

0:03:24.960,0:03:35.340
"Jesus, give me bread" - Jesus may say, "Hold on. Not that I will not give you but hold on.

0:03:35.340,0:03:38.720
It is not the right time to give you".

0:03:38.720,0:03:43.640
That does not mean that your prayer is not answered.

0:03:43.640,0:03:47.840
"Jesus, I want to run."

0:03:47.840,0:03:53.160
"Hmm. This is not the right thing for you now to run."

0:03:53.160,0:03:58.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:58.760,0:04:07.400
Jesus prayed that the cup be taken away from Him three times;

0:04:07.400,0:04:10.720
the same prayer He offered three times.

0:04:10.720,0:04:15.760
That does not mean His prayer was not answered.

0:04:15.760,0:04:21.180
That cup should be taken from Him - three times.

0:04:21.180,0:04:30.840
Let's quickly take a look at the Book of Matthew 26.

0:04:30.840,0:04:35.960
Take our reading from verse 36.

0:04:35.960,0:04:45.720
It says, “Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them,

0:04:45.720,0:04:50.920
‘Sit here while I go over there and pray.’"

0:04:50.920,0:04:55.560
That said Jesus to His disciples.

0:04:55.560,0:05:09.000
“He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.

0:05:09.000,0:05:18.180
Then he said to them, ‘My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

0:05:18.180,0:05:22.700
Stay here and keep watch with me.’

0:05:22.700,0:05:31.320
Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed,

0:05:31.320,0:05:46.780
‘My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.’

0:05:46.780,0:05:53.020
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.

0:05:53.020,0:06:01.240
‘Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?’ he asked Peter.

0:06:01.240,0:06:14.140
‘Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’"

0:06:14.140,0:06:15.920
Verse 42:

0:06:15.920,0:06:25.080
“He went away a second time and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away

0:06:25.080,0:06:31.820
unless I drink it, may your will be done.’

0:06:31.820,0:06:43.000
When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.

0:06:43.000,0:06:59.940
So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.”

0:06:59.940,0:07:13.800
That is prayer of faith, saying the same thing, and then He returned to the disciples.

0:07:13.800,0:07:15.900
Take your time to read.

0:07:15.900,0:07:20.560
FAITH ABOUT ETERNITY

0:07:20.560,0:07:32.540
It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.

0:07:32.540,0:07:50.220
To base faith on our improvement after prayer is oftentimes very disappointing.

0:07:50.220,0:07:53.700
Oftentimes, very what?

0:07:53.700,0:07:58.340
Very disappointing.

0:07:58.340,0:08:06.780
"God, give me bread" - and you base your faith on that - the outcome; bread.

0:08:06.780,0:08:13.600
If the bread does not come, you will be disappointed.

0:08:13.600,0:08:20.300
It works with the will of God and the promise of God; all together.

0:08:20.300,0:08:22.160
What is His will?

0:08:22.160,0:08:26.980
That is what faith works on.

0:08:26.980,0:08:39.460
Is it His will to give you bread, wait a while or not to give you bread?

0:08:39.460,0:08:50.420
According to His will we pray; according to His promise we pray.

0:08:50.420,0:09:05.220
Jesus prayed that the cup be taken away from Him three times.

0:09:05.220,0:09:08.160
"Cup, be taken away from Me."

0:09:08.160,0:09:15.100
Another time again, "Cup, be taken away from Me."

0:09:15.100,0:09:19.080
Three times.

0:09:19.080,0:09:25.240
The prayer of faith can be repeated a thousand times.

0:09:25.240,0:09:40.080
This is why the Bible encourages us in 1 Thessalonians 5:16 to pray without ceasing.

0:09:40.080,0:09:41.900
It says, prayer without what?

0:09:41.900,0:09:45.560
Ceasing.

0:09:45.560,0:09:47.540
Prayer without ceasing

0:09:47.540,0:10:08.440
because our troubles, challenges and situations are instruments that maintain our union with God.

0:10:08.440,0:10:25.680
Tell your neighbour, “My challenges and situations are instruments to maintain my union with God”.

0:10:25.680,0:10:38.360
My challenges, I mean, my troubles are instruments to maintain my oneness with God,

0:10:38.360,0:10:42.080
to maintain my relationship with God.

0:10:42.080,0:10:49.340
But today, the opposite is the case to you.

0:10:49.340,0:10:55.500
It is time you begin to see your challenge as a friend.

0:10:55.500,0:11:05.780
As Christians, when we pray to God to remove our troubles,

0:11:05.780,0:11:16.200
when the troubles are not removed, an equivalent will be provided.

0:11:16.200,0:11:18.440
That is why you are here.

0:11:18.440,0:11:24.380
This is an equivalent.

0:11:24.380,0:11:29.300
That is...

0:11:29.300,0:11:35.320
Where God guides, you find yourself

0:11:35.320,0:11:43.180
where His grace will be sufficient to protect you while you are going through the problem.

0:11:43.180,0:11:48.100
Even though that situation is there, but you are strong in the Lord.

0:11:48.100,0:11:52.200
That brought about our relationship.

0:11:52.200,0:11:55.600
If not your situation, you would not know me.

0:11:55.600,0:11:59.180
If not your situation, I would not know you.

0:11:59.180,0:12:03.300
Where will I know you from? A club house?

0:12:03.300,0:12:06.380
Where will I know you from? A party?

0:12:06.380,0:12:08.980
Where will I know you from?

0:12:08.980,0:12:10.700
I would not know you!

0:12:10.700,0:12:13.360
You are welcome!

0:12:13.360,0:12:14.460
Thank you, sir.

0:12:14.460,0:12:16.320
Can you say, "Thank you, my situation"?

0:12:16.320,0:12:18.760
Thank you, my situation.

0:12:18.760,0:12:24.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:24.600,0:12:27.500
You keep burdening yourself.

0:12:27.500,0:12:33.160
You keep being worried, troubled because of your situation.

0:12:33.160,0:12:38.780
When situation comes, it is time to grow stronger in the Lord.

0:12:38.780,0:12:52.280
As Christians, we must know that our values must be tested against facts and experiences.

0:12:52.280,0:12:55.120
Your value must be tested.

0:12:55.120,0:13:01.300
You say, "What is my value? How much am I worth?"

0:13:01.300,0:13:04.780
If you are no one, nobody will notice, nobody will bother you.

0:13:04.780,0:13:10.880
Each time people talk, "T.B. Joshua, T.B. Joshua" - the name is disturbing them.

0:13:10.880,0:13:12.160
That is a value.

0:13:12.160,0:13:21.200
If I'm no one, nobody will talk about me, nobody will want to attack me or challenge me.

0:13:21.200,0:13:25.520
People believe challenging me is making a name for themselves

0:13:25.520,0:13:29.900
because of value - what I'm worth.

0:13:29.900,0:13:38.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:38.840,0:13:46.300
People want to write an article in their newspaper, "T.B. Joshua..." - just because they want it to sell.

0:13:46.300,0:13:51.660
Look at the Emmanuel TV channel - it is the most watched Christian channel all over the world.

0:13:51.660,0:13:54.380
That is the value.

0:13:54.380,0:14:02.860

You must know that your values must be tested against facts and experiences.

0:14:12.700,0:14:21.960
Tell your neighbour, “My values must be tested against facts and experiences”.

0:14:21.960,0:14:25.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:25.820,0:14:28.860
"No. Why all this?"

0:14:28.860,0:14:33.740
Why do you not want to pay a price for your values?

0:14:33.740,0:14:41.500
We should ask you, if you truly believe in them, in your values...

0:14:41.500,0:14:44.200
Do you believe in them?

0:14:44.200,0:14:49.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:49.860,0:14:59.280
What people say about you; people do this, people hate you, people do that; attack, this and that...

0:14:59.280,0:15:07.380
Some of us here are looking for values; they want to create that value for themselves.

0:15:07.380,0:15:10.600
You see them when everywhere is quiet,

0:15:10.600,0:15:16.880
and in a moment where there is no movement, that is when you see them coming out.

0:15:16.880,0:15:18.960
They want people to see them.

0:15:18.960,0:15:22.720
That is how they create values for themselves.

0:15:27.520,0:15:36.120
The case of Peter serves as a good example of what we are talking about.

0:15:36.120,0:15:53.500
Assume Peter would have caught fish earlier, he would have missed the redemption.

0:15:53.500,0:16:05.020
This shows his wasted hours on the sea kept him for a new level in life.

Your sickness can keep you for a new level.

0:16:15.360,0:16:20.160
Your disappointment can keep you for a new level.

0:16:20.160,0:16:25.860
Failure can keep one for a new level.

0:16:25.860,0:16:32.180
Hatred, persecution and temptation can do the same; it will keep you.

0:16:32.180,0:16:37.220
You keep saying, "My colleagues are going; see my colleagues - they are there, they are making money,

0:16:37.220,0:16:39.980
I don't have a job, joblessness..."

0:16:39.980,0:16:43.980

Maybe God wants to keep you for a new level.

0:17:03.420,0:17:11.480
Maybe God is keeping or preserving you

0:17:11.480,0:17:18.400
to strengthen your desire and your determination for Him.

0:17:18.400,0:17:29.240
Ask your neighbour, “What are the things you are praying for whose answer seems to delay?”

0:17:29.240,0:17:35.920
Maybe God wants to preserve you.

0:17:35.920,0:17:42.640
Maybe God wants to keep you for a new level.

0:17:42.640,0:17:52.520

If you meet any successful person today, they would tell you.

0:18:14.580,0:18:30.660
If you meet a wonderful married couple, they would tell you what they went through to be there.

0:18:30.660,0:18:36.080
If you meet the person you call your role model today,

0:18:36.080,0:18:42.440
they would tell you what it takes to be your role model.

0:18:42.440,0:18:52.000
As you count your blessings every day, take time to also count your failures.

0:18:52.000,0:18:59.260
There is a school for failure and a school for blessing.

0:18:59.260,0:19:05.800
What we are saying has nothing to do with age.

0:19:05.800,0:19:14.320
Because you consider your age for everything you do.

0:19:14.320,0:19:21.640
It has nothing to do with family; you consider your family in everything you do.

0:19:21.640,0:19:28.420
It has nothing to do with education, human natural gift, because you consider all this,

0:19:28.420,0:19:35.740
"I'm a graduate, I'm a professor. I have been to this or that place, I have travelled all over the world.

0:19:35.740,0:19:40.880
See this man there - he is illiterate and I am a professor."

0:19:40.880,0:19:45.620
It has nothing to do with it.

0:20:29.160,0:20:30.940
No!

0:20:30.940,0:20:33.920
I really want to talk to you.

0:20:33.920,0:20:37.640
Say, “I really want to talk to you”.

0:20:37.640,0:20:43.240
That is why you don't see me doing this...

0:20:43.240,0:20:55.160
I'm expecting somebody to shout, "Pastor! Hey!", while you are quiet.

0:20:55.160,0:20:58.800
I'm expecting to jump, "Yes!"

0:20:58.800,0:21:03.820
"Help me to jump, I want to see!" - "Hey!" - "More, more, more!"

0:21:03.820,0:21:12.020
You don't need more of this, you just need the one God wants me to give to you.

0:21:12.020,0:21:16.460
You keep opening the door God has not opened.

0:21:16.460,0:21:23.820
Tell your neighbour, "You keep opening the door God has not opened".

0:21:23.820,0:21:27.880
Can you see? This is why many of you are like this.

0:21:27.880,0:21:33.680
You keep taking what God has not given you.

0:21:33.680,0:21:39.460
You keep opening the door God has not opened.

0:21:39.460,0:21:43.520
You keep taking what God has not given you.

0:21:43.520,0:21:48.980
That is why it is difficult to live long with those things.

0:21:48.980,0:21:52.220
At the time you need those things, they are not there for you

0:21:52.220,0:22:00.580
because you take it when God has not given you.

0:22:00.580,0:22:11.780
Much fame, popularity, wealth has shivered today.

0:22:11.780,0:22:22.800
If God has given you, He gives you for the children yet unborn to live and see.

0:22:22.800,0:22:27.720
This is why you see our life epileptic today.

At the time you are not strong, the thing is no longer there.

0:22:41.640,0:22:48.640
Tell your neighbour, “We keep taking what God has not given us.

0:22:48.640,0:22:56.100
We keep opening the door that God has not opened".

0:22:56.100,0:23:04.820
That is, the blessings, wealth and fame of many today.

0:23:04.820,0:23:16.640
The joy of the blessing and the fame is to see it when you are no longer living.

0:23:16.640,0:23:23.040
Die and leave it behind.

0:23:23.040,0:23:29.960
You are not blessed only for this generation but for the generation yet unborn.

0:23:29.960,0:23:36.560
If the apostles had died with their achievements, people like me would not be here today.

0:23:36.560,0:23:40.960
I’m a partaker of an inheritance of saints.

So, you can still return what God has no given you and you wait for what God is about to give you.

0:23:56.560,0:23:57.560
It is not too late.

0:23:57.560,0:24:07.020
Tell your neighbour, “Return what you have not been given and wait for what God is about to give”.

0:24:11.940,0:24:15.100
These are the challenges all over the world.

0:24:15.100,0:24:20.820
Not only you; the nation, the continent, the world.

0:24:20.820,0:24:30.920
Every aspect of life - marriage, business, career, this and that.

0:24:30.920,0:24:33.940
If God has not given you and you take it...

0:24:33.940,0:24:37.200
Not that you would not be able to take it - you can take it when God...

0:24:37.200,0:24:43.960
The Bible says, "The blessing I give, not as the world gives them".

0:24:43.960,0:24:49.180
You can take, even when God has not given you - no problem.

0:24:49.180,0:24:53.020
God's time is the best.

0:24:53.020,0:24:56.880
I want someone to smile with me, I want someone to smile here.

0:24:56.880,0:24:59.880
You are too frowned.

0:24:59.880,0:25:03.480
Why are you too frowned?

0:25:03.480,0:25:08.700
Let me believe you, you are too frowned.

0:25:08.700,0:25:11.780
Smile!

0:25:11.780,0:25:17.980
Or you have taken what God has not given you?

0:25:17.980,0:25:20.640
Smile, smile, smile.

0:25:20.640,0:25:23.440
Oh no, this is not real.

0:25:23.440,0:25:25.900
I want that kind of smile.

0:25:25.900,0:25:29.640
Let me hear you.

0:25:29.640,0:25:32.060
What are you saying there?

0:25:32.060,0:25:34.000
You say you will return it?

0:25:34.000,0:25:36.340
Yes.

0:25:36.340,0:25:37.280
Thank you.

0:25:37.280,0:25:39.440
Give thanks to Him.

0:25:47.060,0:25:51.500
Such a wonderful time having you around me.

0:25:51.500,0:25:53.100
Do you know I love you?

0:25:53.100,0:25:53.960
Yes.

0:25:53.960,0:25:58.880
How do you know?

0:25:58.880,0:26:01.540
How do you know that I love you?

0:26:01.540,0:26:06.680
Because I have a question I want to ask you, "How do you know I love you?"

0:26:06.680,0:26:11.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:11.320,0:26:12.740
Do you love me?

0:26:12.740,0:26:14.060
Yes!

0:26:14.060,0:26:16.480
You love me because you come to the church?

0:26:16.480,0:26:18.040
No!

0:26:18.040,0:26:22.140
Yes, no worries - time will tell.

0:26:22.140,0:26:24.640
Tell your neighbour, "Time will tell".

0:26:24.640,0:26:26.660
Do you know what I mean by "time will tell"?

0:26:26.660,0:26:33.540
How can you be inside the church and say that you hate me?

0:26:33.540,0:26:37.240
You are inside the church and you are looking at me and you say, "I hate you".

0:26:37.240,0:26:42.700
It is very difficult; time will tell - when you are out there, we will know.

0:26:42.700,0:26:45.900
Time will tell - it is a matter of time.

0:26:45.900,0:26:50.480
The question I'm asking is not even relevant.

0:26:50.480,0:26:58.040
How can I be looking at you and say, "Love me"; what will I be expecting from you?

0:26:58.040,0:27:00.800
Three much!

0:27:00.800,0:27:04.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:04.600,0:27:07.440
You have not asked me whether I love you.

0:27:07.440,0:27:12.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:12.640,0:27:16.440
No, ask me - I know you know I love you.

0:27:16.440,0:27:18.140
Ask me this question.

0:27:18.140,0:27:20.540
Do you love us?

0:27:20.540,0:27:25.000
OK, you say what?

0:27:25.000,0:27:28.260
Do you love us?

0:27:28.260,0:27:31.380
OK, thank you for loving me.

0:27:31.380,0:27:33.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:33.600,0:27:37.480
That will answer. Thank you for loving me.

0:27:37.480,0:27:43.760
Because you say you love me -  reciprocate.

0:27:43.760,0:27:47.160
If you love me, I love you.

0:27:47.160,0:27:48.140
That is it.

0:27:48.140,0:27:50.300
That can work.

0:27:50.300,0:27:52.680
Oh my God.
Thank you.

0:27:52.680,0:27:57.700
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

0:27:57.700,0:28:01.240
May God bless His Word.

0:28:01.240,0:28:03.640
Thank You, Lord.
