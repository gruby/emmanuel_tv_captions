Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for the people in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:05.240,0:00:11.240
He encounters this lady and the power of God exposes whatever that is not of God in her life.

0:00:11.240,0:00:13.600
Let's see how she was delivered.

0:00:13.600,0:00:16.080
I want blood.

0:00:16.080,0:00:17.400
Speak out!
You want what?

0:00:17.400,0:00:18.660
Blood!

0:00:18.660,0:00:20.900
You want blood?

0:00:20.900,0:00:22.220
What have you done to her?

0:00:22.220,0:00:23.700
I want to kill.

0:00:23.700,0:00:26.340
What have you done to her career and her family?

0:00:26.340,0:00:27.980
Speak!

0:00:27.980,0:00:31.140
I split.

0:00:31.140,0:00:32.180
Speak loud, you demon!

0:00:32.180,0:00:33.200
I split.

0:00:33.200,0:00:34.120
You split the family?

0:00:34.120,0:00:35.580
I split.

0:00:35.580,0:00:38.920
How many are you in this body?

0:00:38.920,0:00:39.860
Eleven.

0:00:39.860,0:00:41.380
Who is number one?

0:00:41.380,0:00:45.340
Number one!

0:00:45.340,0:00:47.340
Death.

0:00:47.340,0:00:48.860
Number two?

0:00:48.860,0:00:51.380
Spirit of what?
Speak out!

0:00:51.380,0:00:53.980
Look at this man. Who is this man to you?

0:00:53.980,0:00:55.480
She married him.

0:00:55.480,0:00:56.940
She married him?

0:00:56.940,0:00:58.840
Who are you in this body?

0:00:58.840,0:01:00.860
A man.

0:01:00.860,0:01:03.880
You are a man?

0:01:03.880,0:01:06.320
What can you say about your wife?

0:01:06.320,0:01:09.860
She is my wife; she has been struggling.

0:01:09.860,0:01:13.860
She has been afflicted for quite a while.

0:01:13.860,0:01:15.860
Who is the cause of the troubles in the marriage?

0:01:15.860,0:01:17.060
Speak out!

0:01:17.060,0:01:17.800
Who is the cause of their troubles?

0:01:17.800,0:01:18.540
I am.

0:01:18.540,0:01:19.900
You are the cause?

0:01:19.900,0:01:21.040
How long have you been in her?

0:01:21.040,0:01:22.000
Since birth.

0:01:22.000,0:01:27.740
How did you enter her?

0:01:27.740,0:01:28.920
In a dream.

0:01:28.920,0:01:31.700
In a dream?

0:01:31.700,0:01:34.820
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:01:34.820,0:01:41.080
Prophet T.B. Joshua offers spirit-filled prayer to her,

0:01:41.080,0:01:46.860
and the evil spirit flees at the mention of the name Jesus Christ.

0:01:46.860,0:01:48.400
Glory be to God!

0:01:48.400,0:01:51.200
She is free in Jesus' name.

0:01:51.880,0:01:55.340
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:55.640,0:01:57.200
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:57.200,0:02:02.100
My name is Danielle Amy and I am from Australia.

0:02:02.100,0:02:06.760
The man beside me is my lovely husband Trevor.

0:02:06.760,0:02:07.980
You are both very welcome.

0:02:07.980,0:02:13.380
All the way from Australia - you've really come a long way.

0:02:13.380,0:02:16.020
The Holy Spirit is the rewarder.

0:02:16.020,0:02:18.760
You have been delivered as we saw on the screen.

0:02:18.760,0:02:23.640
We want to hear from you about how those evil spirits have been affecting your life.

0:02:23.640,0:02:28.100
Please, go ahead with your testimony.

0:02:28.100,0:02:33.420
What brought me to The SCOAN was that

0:02:33.420,0:02:36.960
I had been struggling with my health and had been diagnosed

0:02:36.960,0:02:43.580
with several autoimmune diseases and disorders.

0:02:43.580,0:02:50.960
My family members are quite sick and I was looking at them.

0:02:50.960,0:02:57.440
I just believed that God had more for myself and my family

0:02:57.440,0:03:01.000
and I wasn't going to take "no" for an answer.

0:03:01.000,0:03:08.240
We applied to come to The SCOAN and to receive healing and deliverance.

0:03:08.240,0:03:13.220
Our sister mentioned that she came not only due to the evil attacks she was facing

0:03:13.220,0:03:18.420
but also because she had some eating disorders and allergies that had been affecting her life.

0:03:18.420,0:03:24.300
Please go ahead and let us know how these problems had affected you.

0:03:24.300,0:03:27.020
Autoimmune is when the body attacks itself.

0:03:27.020,0:03:33.400
I was constantly being diagnosed with different problems within my body

0:03:33.400,0:03:37.980
because my body kept on attacking different areas.

0:03:37.980,0:03:40.340
It was just exhausting.

0:03:40.340,0:03:52.100
I would spend the majority of my time by myself or in bed because I was just beyond exhausted.

0:03:52.100,0:03:54.820
The Lord has healed me.

0:03:54.820,0:04:02.660
Since the deliverance and healing, I haven't taken any of the medications that I usually take on a daily basis.

0:04:02.660,0:04:06.220
I feel a lot better, I have a lot more of energy.

0:04:06.220,0:04:11.300
Let's put our hands for Jesus!

0:04:11.300,0:04:15.660
You mentioned that you were having some different health-wise problems

0:04:15.660,0:04:20.840
but it was as a result of the evil attacks you had been facing.

0:04:20.840,0:04:25.800
You mentioned that you went to the doctors and they kept diagnosing different problems with you.

0:04:25.800,0:04:32.720
Can you explain more about the evil attacks you experienced and how they affected you?

0:04:32.720,0:04:34.740
I had been having evil attacks.

0:04:34.740,0:04:41.960
The first one that I remember was when I was about five or six years of age.

0:04:41.960,0:04:52.060
I've been having them throughout my entire life - either in dreams or visions but often in the physical.

0:04:52.060,0:05:03.340
Sometimes, I would just wake up from my sleep and I would have bruises and strangle marks around my neck.

0:05:03.340,0:05:15.180
I would have bites on my body in places that I wouldn't be able to reach by myself.

0:05:15.180,0:05:19.060
I would have bruises and scratches all over me.

0:05:19.060,0:05:30.600
I would have evil spirits come and visit me and speak to me when I was awake like I am now.

0:05:30.600,0:05:36.340
OK. You mentioned that when you woke up, you would physically see bruises and scratches on your body

0:05:36.340,0:05:39.300
in places that you couldn't reach yourself,

0:05:39.300,0:05:44.040
letting you know that something else had been doing these things to you.

0:05:44.040,0:05:45.800
Yes, that's correct.

0:05:45.800,0:05:50.740
Did you ever explain these things to the doctors in Australia?

0:05:50.740,0:05:52.220
No.

0:05:52.220,0:05:55.620
I actually felt quite ashamed and isolated.

0:05:55.620,0:05:59.160
There are very few people that I would actually share this with

0:05:59.160,0:06:07.200
because I guess culturally, it's very different in Australia.

0:06:07.200,0:06:14.780
If I ever told the doctor how I got the bruises or some of the injuries I'd sustained,

0:06:14.780,0:06:18.100
which actually led to me being hospitalized,

0:06:18.100,0:06:24.840
I was afraid that I would be institutionalized because they would think I was insane.

0:06:24.840,0:06:29.280
Did you explain these things to your husband?

0:06:29.280,0:06:34.380
Yes, I did but he began to encounter them for himself.

0:06:34.380,0:06:38.940
He was a witness after we got married.

0:06:38.940,0:06:43.300
You mentioned that you would also see them physically, not just in the dream.

0:06:43.300,0:06:48.880
Can you give us an instance of when this happened to you?

0:06:48.880,0:06:54.000
I had one night just after we got married.

0:06:54.000,0:06:58.360
I wasn't able to sleep so I went into another room to lay down.

0:06:58.360,0:07:02.000
I fell asleep and I had a dream.

0:07:02.000,0:07:09.640
There were three beings standing in my room and they were talking about how I was going to die.

0:07:09.640,0:07:17.240
I was going to be involved in a car accident but it wasn't the car accident that was going to kill me -

0:07:17.240,0:07:22.920
it was a ruptured artery that was going to kill me.

0:07:22.920,0:07:36.460
I woke up from the dream because I heard talking, and I physically saw the three beings standing before me.

0:07:36.460,0:07:39.920
Can you describe what you saw standing before you?

0:07:39.920,0:07:44.720
They were tall and dark in appearance.

0:07:44.720,0:07:53.520
I saw like a shimmering green as if they had green coats or capes on, although it was very dark in the room.

0:07:53.520,0:07:55.340
The room was very cold.

0:07:55.340,0:07:57.020
I just felt...

0:07:57.020,0:08:00.540
Any way to describe it - it is just death.

0:08:00.540,0:08:06.520
Danielle Amy & Husband - Deliverance Testimony

0:08:06.520,0:08:09.480
I called my husband.

0:08:09.480,0:08:17.040
He came in and commented that there was something wrong, before I even said to him what had happened.

0:08:17.040,0:08:18.760
We began to pray.

0:08:18.760,0:08:25.520
We both got up and went into our dining area.

0:08:25.520,0:08:26.940
We had a big book case.

0:08:26.940,0:08:33.100
On top of the book case were several candles.

0:08:33.100,0:08:38.300
One of the candles had been taken down and put on the kitchen bench.

0:08:38.300,0:08:42.440
A green flame was burning in the candle.

0:08:42.440,0:08:45.340
Neither my husband or I had touched the candle.

0:08:45.340,0:08:48.660
Neither of us had brought it down or lit the flame.

0:08:48.660,0:08:52.620
We felt such an evil presence in the house.

0:08:52.620,0:08:56.880
You mentioned just before that the three beings were standing there

0:08:56.880,0:09:01.000
and you heard them discussing a plan of how to kill you

0:09:01.000,0:09:04.560
but your husband walked in and said something was not right.

0:09:04.560,0:09:07.960
Did he see the beings as well at that time?

0:09:07.960,0:09:12.040
No, he didn't.

0:09:12.040,0:09:16.880
After praying together, we went back to bed together.

0:09:16.880,0:09:20.260
I was laying awake.

0:09:20.260,0:09:23.040
My husband fell asleep.

0:09:23.040,0:09:32.100
While I was lying there, this being came over me and began to scream violently in my face.

0:09:32.100,0:09:38.500
My husband woke up from his sleep, rebuking in Jesus' name.

0:09:38.500,0:09:45.460
He turned to me describing what he had just seen, what had just happened in his dream.

0:09:45.460,0:09:55.460
What he had seen in his dream was exactly what I had witnessed being awake as I was laying.

0:09:55.460,0:10:00.360
What you experienced physically; a demon shouting over your head -

0:10:00.360,0:10:08.180
your husband saw it happening too, as he was sleeping but he woke up rebuking this demon in Jesus' name?

0:10:08.180,0:10:09.840
Yes, that is correct.

0:10:09.840,0:10:12.680
What happened after that?

0:10:12.680,0:10:17.440
At that time I wasn't working because I was quite unwell.

0:10:17.440,0:10:23.680
I had a friend that was also unwell and I wanted to cook for her and her family.

0:10:23.680,0:10:29.600
I made food and put it in the car to go.

0:10:29.600,0:10:35.160
As I was driving, I went to turn down the street to her house.

0:10:35.160,0:10:45.760
Out of nowhere, a car came and hit me and totaled the car that I was in.

0:10:45.760,0:10:54.340
I hit my head and hurt my neck but I didn't want to go to hospital so I just went home.

0:10:54.340,0:10:58.820
My husband came home to be with me.

0:10:58.820,0:11:03.160
As I was laying on the couch, because I was in quite a bit of pain,

0:11:03.160,0:11:08.820
a sort of a tiger came and bit me on the neck.

0:11:08.820,0:11:12.640
I was in excruciating pain and I couldn't move.

0:11:12.640,0:11:20.020
My heart was not beating properly and I had pain down my arms.

0:11:20.020,0:11:25.360
I was admitted into hospital, into emergency.

0:11:25.360,0:11:26.580
OK, sorry...

0:11:26.580,0:11:30.380
We just want to get some thing clear from you.

0:11:30.380,0:11:34.960
You mentioned that after having that strange encounter that day,

0:11:34.960,0:11:43.420
listening to evil beings explaining how they planned to kill you in a car crash,

0:11:43.420,0:11:49.160
the very same day, as you were in your car on your way to drop some food to a sick friend,

0:11:49.160,0:11:51.680
you had a car accident.

0:11:51.680,0:11:56.040
Then you went home and you said a tiger came in and bit your neck.

0:11:56.040,0:12:04.760
Were you sleeping that time when you saw a tiger coming in or was it physically?

0:12:04.760,0:12:06.380
Yes, that was physically.

0:12:06.380,0:12:09.860
I hadn't been asleep.

0:12:09.860,0:12:10.460
Yes.

0:12:10.460,0:12:17.160
The only way to describe it is like when you have a fire and there is smoke -

0:12:17.160,0:12:24.660
it was the same density and texture but very clear and there were colours.

0:12:24.660,0:12:27.260
It came and bit me.

0:12:27.260,0:12:30.680
So, the tiger physically came into where you were?

0:12:30.680,0:12:33.880
Yes, it did.

0:12:33.880,0:12:39.100
What happened after you went to the hospital?

0:12:39.100,0:12:44.320
I was admitted for five days in intensive care.

0:12:44.320,0:12:49.260
They weren't able to find out what the problem was.

0:12:49.260,0:12:58.320
I was in such a bad pain I couldn't get out of the bed to go to the bathroom, or anything.

0:12:58.320,0:13:07.900
They couldn't relieve the pain so they accidentally knocked me with too much pain relievers.

0:13:07.900,0:13:14.840
I ended up going catatonic and unresponsive for a period.

0:13:14.840,0:13:21.100
Just before that happened, whilst receiving one of the injections,

0:13:21.100,0:13:26.940
again, I saw the tiger come and bite me.

0:13:26.940,0:13:34.280
Eventually, they ended up doing an MRI scan.

0:13:34.280,0:13:40.180
They found that the muscles around my artery and neck had been constricted.

0:13:40.180,0:13:44.680
They were concerned that it was going to cause a stroke.

0:13:44.680,0:13:49.940
They couldn't work out what was causing it.

0:13:49.940,0:13:54.060
The doctors couldn't understand what was happening to you.

0:13:54.060,0:13:59.640
You mentioned that they gave you so much medication that your whole body became unresponsive

0:13:59.640,0:14:02.820
and you were in a critical condition.

0:14:02.820,0:14:04.260
Yes, that's correct.

0:14:04.260,0:14:14.260
At first I was showing no signs at all that the medication was affecting me negatively or positively.

0:14:14.260,0:14:21.700
There was a "build up" in my system and it ended up just hitting me in one go.

0:14:21.700,0:14:28.480
So, at this point you realized that your problem had gone beyond human solution, beyond physical means?

0:14:28.480,0:14:29.400
Yes.

0:14:29.400,0:14:32.540
I knew that it was spiritual.

0:14:32.540,0:14:36.040
I'd known all my life that it was spiritual.

0:14:36.040,0:14:40.640
I became desperate for a breakthrough.

0:14:40.640,0:14:48.300
I believed that God heals, delivers, and He is a good God.

0:14:48.300,0:14:51.880
We decided that we wanted to come to The SCOAN.

0:14:51.880,0:14:54.420
We made an application to come.

0:14:54.420,0:14:58.200
How did you find out about The SCOAN?

0:14:58.200,0:15:05.980
About a year after this attack, my husband and I were looking at some things on Youtube.

0:15:05.980,0:15:11.880
I don't think it was related but we ended up seeing a video pop-up.

0:15:11.880,0:15:18.320
At first we didn't want to click on it because we thought it might be evil

0:15:18.320,0:15:24.640
but we decided to click on it anyway and our lives were changed as a result.

0:15:24.640,0:15:30.040
So instantly, when you started watching videos from The SCOAN your life began to change?

0:15:30.040,0:15:31.100
Yes.

0:15:31.100,0:15:34.680
Our house was filled with peace.

0:15:34.680,0:15:42.960
Instead of feeling a demonic presence, we began to feel an angelic presence.

0:15:42.960,0:15:43.720
Glory be to God!

0:15:43.720,0:15:48.240
Let's put our hands for Jesus Christ!

0:15:48.240,0:15:54.140
We thank God for Emmanuel TV - one of the means He is using to change lives.

0:15:54.140,0:15:58.440
Finally, you and your husband came to The SCOAN for your deliverance.

0:15:58.440,0:16:06.480
Can you share with us what happened on the day when you received the prayer and the deliverance?

0:16:06.480,0:16:12.920
Watching the video is actually quite surreal.

0:16:12.920,0:16:21.720
I just got hit and it was on my slack and I was stunned.

0:16:21.720,0:16:29.600
I guess any way to describe it is like I was behind a pane of glass and a 3D movie was happening

0:16:29.600,0:16:35.180
around me but there was no interaction on my behalf.

0:16:35.180,0:16:44.860
I heard talking but it was like I was waiting to hear what someone else was saying.

0:16:44.860,0:16:49.120
There was a strange voice coming that I was hearing.

0:16:49.120,0:16:54.420
As you were receiving the deliverance you saw that there was a spiritual warfare going on at that time?

0:16:54.420,0:16:57.540
Yes, I did.

0:16:57.540,0:16:59.780
Now, you are delivered.

0:16:59.780,0:17:03.640
What are the differences that you have noticed in your life?

0:17:03.640,0:17:05.600
I am a lot more peaceful.

0:17:05.600,0:17:14.480
I haven't had any more evil attacks or spiritual visitations.

0:17:14.480,0:17:16.900
I have just got a lot more energy.

0:17:16.900,0:17:19.800
My body feels really good.

0:17:19.800,0:17:23.140
My appetite has got a lot better as well.

0:17:23.140,0:17:29.960
Glory be to God! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:17:29.960,0:17:33.960
We want to hear a few words from your husband standing beside you,

0:17:33.960,0:17:40.140
what he would like to say about the experiences, what he noticed in your life previously and now

0:17:40.140,0:17:41.820
that you are delivered in Jesus' name.

0:17:41.820,0:17:45.560
Please go ahead, starting with your name and what you have to say

0:17:45.560,0:17:49.360
about what God has done in the life of your wife.

0:17:49.360,0:17:52.120
My name is Trevor Philips and I'm from Australia.

0:17:52.120,0:17:55.220
Just to testify to the goodness of God...

0:17:55.220,0:17:59.480
Prior to my wife's deliverance and encounter with the Father,

0:17:59.480,0:18:07.940
she was experiencing a lot of demonic, evil attacks, frustration, stress, serious health conditions

0:18:07.940,0:18:11.020
that medically could not be resolved.

0:18:11.020,0:18:15.700
Visits to different doctors just led to dead ends.

0:18:15.700,0:18:22.780
After her deliverance by the grace of God, she is full of peace, radiant, calm, relaxed.

0:18:22.780,0:18:25.240
She just seems overall like a different person.

0:18:25.240,0:18:26.720
Glory be to God.

0:18:26.720,0:18:33.020
Amen. Let's put our hands together!

0:18:33.020,0:18:37.700
That is the evidence of Jesus Christ: lives changed.

0:18:37.700,0:18:41.020
Madam, we'd love to hear from you once again.

0:18:41.020,0:18:43.760
We want to hear your words of advice for others

0:18:43.760,0:18:49.360
because we believe that many people have been going through a similar thing.

0:18:49.360,0:18:54.420
We believe you have some words of advice to encourage them.

0:18:54.420,0:19:04.200
My advice especially to people of the "Western world" is that the spiritual realm is a reality.

0:19:04.200,0:19:10.460
I believe that there are a lot of people who have suffered in similar ways as I did.

0:19:10.460,0:19:14.500
But Jesus has conquered the enemy.

0:19:14.500,0:19:18.080
Jesus has given us salvation.

0:19:18.080,0:19:21.120
He has delivered us and He has healed us.

0:19:21.120,0:19:32.220
I think it is important that we allow Him to save us, to heal us, to deliver us because He is more than capable.

0:19:32.220,0:19:40.760
He is total in His healing, His deliverance and His salvation.

0:19:40.760,0:19:44.300
There is no partiality about it.

0:19:44.300,0:19:46.440
He is amazing.

0:19:46.440,0:19:49.420
Amen! Let's clap for our Lord!

0:19:49.420,0:19:53.460
Danielle Amy & Husband - Deliverance Testimony

0:19:53.460,0:19:55.220
He is amazing indeed.

0:19:55.220,0:19:58.840
He has totally transformed the life of this lady.

0:19:58.840,0:20:02.840
You mentioned before that you had an eating disorder, some allergies,

0:20:02.840,0:20:07.740
you were taking a lot of medication as a result of this.

0:20:07.740,0:20:11.180
How about now? 
How is your physical health?

0:20:11.180,0:20:13.340
I feel really good.

0:20:13.340,0:20:18.820
I have got a lot of energy, strength and stamina that I didn't have before.

0:20:18.820,0:20:23.380
My appetite has returned.

0:20:23.380,0:20:25.820
For the benefit of the viewers;

0:20:25.820,0:20:32.060
we also want to ask once again about the time when Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for you

0:20:32.060,0:20:34.340
and the spiritual warfare was going on.

0:20:34.340,0:20:36.320
Can you explain how you felt at that time?

0:20:36.320,0:20:43.240
What happened to you at that time of deliverance?

0:20:43.240,0:20:52.180
It was like I was just removed, like I was in "echo" of something that was happening.

0:20:52.180,0:21:00.220
It was like me as a person was lagging behind whatever was going on, whatever warfare was happening.

0:21:00.220,0:21:10.520
Spiritually, it was like it all was one second delayed for me, and I was watching it after it had happened.

0:21:10.520,0:21:19.220
I guess the way to describe it is that my body felt stunned.

0:21:19.220,0:21:26.800
Actually, there was like a hand upon my head, upon my forehead for quite a while afterwards.

0:21:26.800,0:21:32.360
It was very soothing and comforting.

0:21:32.360,0:21:35.800
When the man of God delivered you, you fell to the ground.

0:21:35.800,0:21:38.860
How did you feel when you got up?

0:21:38.860,0:21:49.500
I felt a bit disoriented about what just happened but I felt really good and like "lighter".

0:21:49.500,0:21:51.160
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:21:51.160,0:21:55.480
Let's put our hands together for Him!

0:21:55.480,0:21:58.900
Do you mean that today you are completely delivered and free?

0:21:58.900,0:21:59.920
I'm free.

0:21:59.920,0:22:01.340
Thank You, Jesus!

0:22:01.340,0:22:07.780
Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for allowing us to eat of the fruit of your life.

0:22:07.780,0:22:08.520
Amen.

0:22:08.520,0:22:12.360
"Thank you" is a response from a happy and free heart.

0:22:12.360,0:22:15.240
Let's put our hands together one more time!
