My name is Blessing Okey Odazi.

0:13:03.500,0:13:04.660
I came from Delta State.

0:13:04.660,0:13:09.180
Just like the man of God prophesied to me that the fibroid will surely come out.

0:13:09.180,0:13:14.600
As we were singing worship songs, I felt a sensation and saw blood gushing out.

0:13:14.600,0:13:19.000
I came because of the multiple fibroids I have been having for the past eight years.

0:13:19.000,0:13:21.040
I have tried many things but nothing helped.

0:13:21.040,0:13:23.420
Today, I decided to come to The SCOAN. Praise God!

0:13:23.420,0:13:24.860
I thank God what He has done in my life.

0:13:24.860,0:13:27.480
How do you feel now that the fibroid is coming out?

0:13:27.480,0:13:33.640
I felt restless so I kept moving but I am okay now.

0:13:33.640,0:13:36.780
So if your own fibroid can come out,

0:13:36.780,0:13:40.020
because the man of God said, you have a fibroid and that fibroid will come out,

0:13:40.020,0:13:43.980
and the man of God has also said everyone's chain has been broken,

0:13:43.980,0:13:45.460
what do you think has happened to everyone?

0:13:45.460,0:13:49.020
Everybody's chain will be broken too, in Jesus' name!

0:13:49.020,0:13:51.660
My chain has broken today, in Jesus' name!

0:13:51.660,0:13:54.920
Everybody's own is broken too, in Jesus' name!
