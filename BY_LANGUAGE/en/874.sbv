Good Morning Church!

0:00:02.940,0:00:06.120
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:06.120,0:00:17.200
My names are Ochomma Uche.
I am from Imo State, Nigeria.

0:00:17.200,0:00:20.360
There are two parts of my testimony.

0:00:20.360,0:00:26.240
The first part is confessional.

0:00:26.240,0:00:42.840
I belonged to a church, with a group of people who condemned the man of God, who preached against him,

0:00:42.840,0:00:54.020
who called him names not only in our congregation but also to members of other churches.

0:00:54.020,0:01:01.240
I belonged to one of the foremost ministries in Nigeria.

0:01:01.240,0:01:03.560
We had a name for him.

0:01:03.560,0:01:07.660
It is very sad to say it but I say it for the glory of God.

0:01:07.660,0:01:10.660
They used to call him "tuberculosis".

0:01:10.660,0:01:15.960
If you belonged to that church and you are here now - shout "Hallelujah!".

0:01:15.960,0:01:20.760
I know some of them are here.

0:01:20.760,0:01:23.920
Praise God!

0:01:23.920,0:01:33.440
I used to be a pastor and later a member of this church, that I told you about.

0:01:33.440,0:01:41.380
We went about vilifying the man of God, speaking evil about him, calling him all sorts of names,

0:01:41.380,0:01:45.260
calling him "antychrist" himself.

0:01:45.260,0:01:57.060
While we were doing this, it occurred to me that this man that I speak against, that I judge -

0:01:57.060,0:01:59.980
I have never heard his word.

0:01:59.980,0:02:01.900
I never...

0:02:01.900,0:02:06.320
I could not recall any of his word that would be offensive.

0:02:06.320,0:02:10.780
So I decided to say, "No. I will look to the scriptures."

0:02:10.780,0:02:17.320
My spirit referred me to Acts 17:11.

0:02:17.320,0:02:24.800
What makes a man noble is his ability to listen to a message and compare it with scriptures,

0:02:24.800,0:02:27.380
besides the miracles.

0:02:27.380,0:02:31.380
Because behind any miracle there must be a Word.

0:02:31.380,0:02:39.300
So, this drove me to watching Emmanuel TV just to hear the man of God.

0:02:39.300,0:02:50.800
When I started listening to the Emmanuel TV, my family was upset with me

0:02:50.800,0:02:55.520
because you couldn't watch Emmanuel TV in my place.

0:02:55.520,0:03:01.780
Even now, some of my acquaintances who are pastors, evangelists -

0:03:01.780,0:03:08.260
as soon as I switch the Emmanuel TV on, they all leave.

0:03:08.260,0:03:10.000
Praise God!

0:03:10.000,0:03:18.380
I'm sorry sir, before going further - you mentioned you were a pastor in this ministry and you had been involved

0:03:18.380,0:03:24.500
in saying many negative things concerning the ministry here - The SCOAN.

0:03:24.500,0:03:31.140
Could you just explain a little bit more; for example the kind of prayers that you were offering in that period

0:03:31.140,0:03:35.740
and the kind of things that you were saying at that time?

0:03:35.740,0:03:45.680
Well, you can imagine what you would say against the man, whose words you never heard.

0:03:45.680,0:03:54.660
Because it was a general opinion of our GO, that was the standing order and we believed him.

0:03:54.660,0:04:00.440
So, we took him <T.B. Joshua> as the antichrist himself - certain incarnate,

0:04:00.440,0:04:08.360
who was working miracles with powers that were not of God.

0:04:08.360,0:04:11.580
I am talking of Prophet T.B. Joshua - yes.

0:04:11.580,0:04:19.080
I was moved to listen to this man, to hear his words, to search the scriptures, to find out if what he is saying

0:04:19.080,0:04:20.840
is in accordance with the scriptures.

0:04:20.840,0:04:24.000
I started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:04:24.000,0:04:36.280
To my greatest surprise, all his teachings, all the words he taught, in their simplicity, they were all

0:04:36.280,0:04:38.860
in accordance with the scriptures.

0:04:38.860,0:04:47.760
Mr Ochoma Uche
Confession/Deliverance Testimony

0:04:47.760,0:04:50.040
It becomes...

0:04:50.040,0:04:56.240
His teaching are even more clear.

0:04:56.240,0:05:01.980
I began to see the Prophet in a different light.

0:05:01.980,0:05:07.920
I began to feel that perhaps I have been condemning an innocent man.

0:05:07.920,0:05:10.200
I've been speaking evil against an innocent man.

0:05:10.200,0:05:15.820
I felt in my bedroom and I confessed and said, "God, forgive me".

0:05:15.820,0:05:18.460
I remember that day.

0:05:18.460,0:05:22.440
I confessed, I said, "God, forgive me".

0:05:22.440,0:05:29.760
My interest grew to the point that I decided that I would pay a visit to The SCOAN.

0:05:29.760,0:05:37.620
You can imagine; I belong to a church where I preach against the man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua - yes.

0:05:37.620,0:05:41.680
At the same time I was involved in "secret sins".

0:05:41.680,0:05:54.980
I drank, I smoked, I womanised - you can imagine that...

0:05:54.980,0:06:01.280
How a man with this things in his life can condemn a man of God?

0:06:01.280,0:06:04.100
I did it.

0:06:04.100,0:06:09.140
All this happened in my life for the glory of God.

0:06:09.140,0:06:23.760
The truth is: if you are a Christian of any value, none of things I mentioned would ever make you to stand firmly

0:06:23.760,0:06:26.940
in the presence of God.

0:06:26.940,0:06:29.020
Never!

0:06:29.020,0:06:30.320
I know that...

0:06:30.320,0:06:42.860
Yes, I was in the ministry, I was teaching and preaching but right inside of me I knew that all this was "in vain".

0:06:42.860,0:06:48.900
I tried to hide my sins in many ways.

0:06:48.900,0:06:56.360
I would travel 200 kilometres, away from the town, in order to go and indulge myself.

0:06:56.360,0:07:02.460
I would out go at night to very dark places in order to smoke.

0:07:02.460,0:07:10.080
I would drink secretly in places you would never imagine, because I wouldn't want my parents

0:07:10.080,0:07:17.620
my siblings, members of my church to know that I do such deeds.

0:07:17.620,0:07:19.400
I am a brethren.

0:07:19.400,0:07:23.840
I have fought against these things for very long time.

0:07:23.840,0:07:27.220
I have prayed, I have fasted...

0:07:27.220,0:07:34.140
I remember that I fasted for 7 days that the Lord should remove this torment from me.

0:07:34.140,0:07:39.380
2-3 days after the fasting I went back to it.

0:07:39.380,0:07:42.960
I knew that it was a very big problem.

0:07:42.960,0:07:46.520
You said sir that you were hiding these acts.

0:07:46.520,0:07:50.500
Sometimes you would have to travel a long way to indulge yourself.

0:07:50.500,0:07:59.000
Just explain, when you travelled long distances, what would you find yourself doing, even as a pastor.

0:07:59.000,0:08:03.580
Of course, I travelled out in order to hide my sins.

0:08:03.580,0:08:08.740
I travelled out so no eyes would see me doing these sins, that people who know me would not

0:08:08.740,0:08:14.540
recognize me as a person doing such things.

0:08:14.540,0:08:17.280
That was why I had to hide.

0:08:17.280,0:08:21.720
Yes, sleeping with women, prostitutes, drinking...

0:08:21.720,0:08:25.380
I did such things, I did - yes.

0:08:25.380,0:08:31.800
It was very heavy on my spirit, because I know that no person who does such things

0:08:31.800,0:08:34.720
will ever inherit the kingdom.

0:08:34.720,0:08:40.140
It is very clear to me.

0:08:40.140,0:08:47.480
I decided to visit Emmanuel TV after seeing wonders here.

0:08:47.480,0:08:50.800
Initially, I did not pay attention to miracles.

0:08:50.800,0:08:58.260
I was after the Word, because we are redeemed by the Word, through the Word.

0:08:58.260,0:09:04.140
When I listened to the Word, I found the Word correct - then I had the strength to come here.

0:09:04.140,0:09:15.200
Brethren, when I came here for the first time nobody touched me - I just went through the service on Sunday.

0:09:15.200,0:09:19.040
I went home.

0:09:19.040,0:09:26.420
As I left here brethren, without being touched by the man of God, without being prophesied to,

0:09:26.420,0:09:32.700
the spirits of drinking, smoking and womanising left me automatically.

0:09:32.700,0:09:39.640
Mr Ochoma Uche
Confession/DeliveranceTestimony

0:09:39.640,0:09:51.480
It became a personal sign to me that there is God in this place.

0:09:51.480,0:09:52.800
Emmanuel!

0:09:52.800,0:09:54.860
[God with us.]

0:09:54.860,0:10:02.040
Brethren, these are the things we did against T.B. Joshua.

0:10:02.040,0:10:04.500
I am praying that he forgives me.

0:10:04.500,0:10:06.820
I confess publicly.

0:10:06.820,0:10:08.860
I know he is hearing my voice.

0:10:08.860,0:10:15.840
Let him forgive me for what I have done against him.

0:10:15.840,0:10:17.900
I come to what happened here yesterday.

0:10:17.900,0:10:24.260
Yesterday, as the man of God was preaching, I was feeling terribly bad inside of me.

0:10:24.260,0:10:29.160
It was like sitting on thousand of pins.

0:10:29.160,0:10:34.340
My spine, my waist, my belly were hot.

0:10:34.340,0:10:38.760
I was feeling hot inside - extreme discomfort.

0:10:38.760,0:10:48.060
I was in so much pain that I thought that dying would be better for me then to live with such pains in my body.

0:10:48.060,0:10:53.320
When this was going through my body, I remembered his words,

0:10:53.320,0:10:58.540
"All this things have come to take away your joy. Refuse it!"

0:10:58.540,0:11:03.800
I said, "No, it will not take away my joy. If you are dead you will not take away my life".

0:11:03.800,0:11:05.300
I resisted.

0:11:05.300,0:11:12.100
This thing came higher and higher to the point where my eyes went black.

0:11:12.100,0:11:15.560
I thought I was going to fall down.

0:11:15.560,0:11:18.540
What I know, what I had in my ear...

0:11:18.540,0:11:27.820
"This is the storm before the calm".

0:11:27.820,0:11:30.260
From that point the pain started to recede.

0:11:30.260,0:11:33.940
I heard the man of God saying, "In your pains - walk!"

0:11:33.940,0:11:37.080
That was what I remembered him saying.

0:11:37.080,0:11:40.500
I stood up and started moving my limbs.

0:11:40.500,0:11:45.820
To the glory of God - the pain started to recede.

0:11:45.820,0:11:51.100
Now, I am very fit, strong, sound.

0:11:51.100,0:11:54.040
There are no pains any more in my body.

0:11:54.040,0:11:58.340
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:11:58.340,0:12:03.120
Brother is just sharing the instant testimony of what happened yesterday during the mass prayer

0:12:03.120,0:12:05.500
concerning the very severe pains he was having.

0:12:05.500,0:12:11.960
We want to hear from you again brother; since you first stepped your feet in The SCOAN, you mean to say

0:12:11.960,0:12:18.820
that you stopped all the acts of smoking, drinking, womanising, all of that came to an end in the moment

0:12:18.820,0:12:21.000
you stepped your feet in here?

0:12:21.000,0:12:22.840
That's correct.

0:12:22.840,0:12:24.840
They stopped, the urge, you know...

0:12:24.840,0:12:26.520
Whatever you do starts from the urge.

0:12:26.520,0:12:28.520
It is like a thirst.

0:12:28.520,0:12:32.940
Once that emptiness is created in you, you go after it.

0:12:32.940,0:12:38.940
Once that emptiness, urge is not there, you cannot commit an act.

0:12:38.940,0:12:49.060
The urge, spirit of drinking, womanising, smoking - all of them left me.

0:12:49.060,0:12:49.780
Praise God!

0:12:49.780,0:12:54.600
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.

0:12:54.600,0:12:58.640
We thank God that our brother is here in our midst to share this testimony.

0:12:58.640,0:13:04.980
We believe there are many valuable lessons that we have learnt from the statements he has made here.

0:13:04.980,0:13:13.960
What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world; especially those who has engaged in such

0:13:13.960,0:13:19.200
things in the past, including the acts of blasphemy against the servant of God,

0:13:19.200,0:13:20.420
such as Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:13:20.420,0:13:24.820
What would you advise to them based on your own life experience?

0:13:24.820,0:13:34.580
My advice to you is: do not allow the opinion of people around you

0:13:34.580,0:13:40.660
to steer you away from knowing the truth for yourself.

0:13:40.660,0:13:51.780
Do not allow the public opinion to steer you into coming to the partnership with the public.

0:13:51.780,0:13:56.440
Before you judge a man, hear him.

0:13:56.440,0:14:07.000
Before you find yourself offending somebody, take some time and find out the truth about the person.

0:14:07.000,0:14:14.100
What is the point for you to kill a man and later to find out that the man was innocent?

0:14:14.100,0:14:16.620
How would you feel?

0:14:16.620,0:14:26.420
How would you feel stabbing a man with a sword assuming that he had wounded or killed your brother,

0:14:26.420,0:14:29.140
only to find out that the man was innocent?

0:14:29.140,0:14:31.760
How would you feel?

0:14:31.760,0:14:32.940
That was how I felt.

0:14:32.940,0:14:35.640
I wouldn't want anyone to feel like that.

0:14:35.640,0:14:41.340
So brethren, my advice is to find our the truth for yourself

0:14:41.340,0:14:45.480
and God will bear witness to the man of God.

0:14:45.480,0:14:46.640
Praise God.

0:14:46.640,0:14:51.200
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:14:51.200,0:14:56.940
We can see that as our brother said, the man he that initially condemned, spoke against, used all kinds of

0:14:56.940,0:15:03.080
negative words against, ended up being the very same person whom God used to deliver him

0:15:03.080,0:15:07.780
from that spirit of womanising, alcohol, and smoking.

0:15:07.780,0:15:09.340
We give glory to God that he is here right now.

0:15:09.340,0:15:15.080
Just a final word of advice brother - you said that as a pastor you were engaged is such acts.

0:15:15.080,0:15:19.560
What do you want to advise people who are still struggling with such addictions,

0:15:19.560,0:15:23.380
as someone that passed through that and came out through the deliverance

0:15:23.380,0:15:25.360
you received by stepping your feet in here?

0:15:25.360,0:15:27.620
What is your advice to such people?

0:15:27.620,0:15:34.160
My advice is this: I have tried all my personal strength and I failed.

0:15:34.160,0:15:40.660
I have gone through many deliverances; to no avail.

0:15:40.660,0:15:45.940
The problem with any sin or addiction is spiritual.

0:15:45.940,0:15:53.000
What we need is an intervention of God into this matter.

0:15:53.000,0:16:07.240
And the place that I have found, where one can be truly delivered is The SCOAN.

0:16:07.240,0:16:14.700
If you cannot find a deliverance elsewhere, let this place be your last bus stop.

0:16:14.700,0:16:18.320
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:16:18.320,0:16:19.920
Remember, we heard what our brother said.

0:16:19.920,0:16:23.060
He said he had just stepped his feet in here.

0:16:23.060,0:16:27.600
He wasn't actually prayed for, he didn't receive a prophecy, he didn't even receive ministration with

0:16:27.600,0:16:28.680
the morning water.

0:16:28.680,0:16:34.140
Just by stepping his feet into the Arena of Liberty that urge left him.

0:16:34.140,0:16:39.580
We know that as you are here today in the Arena of Liberty, as you have stepped your feet in here today

0:16:39.580,0:16:46.020
for those of us present here - your lives will never remain the same, in Jesus' mighty name.

0:16:46.020,0:16:47.220
Brother, we thank God for your life.

0:16:47.220,0:16:51.380
We pray that God will you the grace to continue, to make His Word the standard for your life,

0:16:51.380,0:16:53.920
and we know that the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:16:53.920,0:16:55.840
Amen.
