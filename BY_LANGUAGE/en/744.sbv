Turning Your MISTAKES Into LESSONS I TB Joshua

Emmanuel! ! ! 
God is with us - Matthew 1:23

0:00:03.860,0:00:05.140
Halleluyah! ! !

0:00:05.140,0:00:14.040
Amen!! (Applause)

0:00:14.040,0:00:23.720
We have seen the name, Jesus working in the Spirit.

0:00:23.720,0:00:32.920
We have seen the value of the name.

0:00:32.920,0:00:44.000
We have seen the value of staying in faith.

0:00:44.000,0:00:45.180
Glory be to God.

0:00:45.180,0:00:47.220
Amen! ! !

0:00:47.220,0:00:49.540
Maybe many of us we don't know,

0:00:49.540,0:00:58.280
the name Jesus we call -
just as we call the name of person.

0:00:58.280,0:01:05.420
You have seen the value of the name so much

0:01:05.420,0:01:08.920
and the value of staying in faith.

0:01:08.920,0:01:11.220
Congratulations!

0:01:11.220,0:01:16.260
Applause! ! !

0:01:16.260,0:01:19.860
I'm in the midst of successful people!

0:01:19.860,0:01:28.260
Amen! ! !
Applause! ! !

0:01:28.260,0:01:30.860
I'm in the midst of joyful people!

0:01:30.860,0:01:36.740
Amen! ! !
Applause! ! !

0:01:36.740,0:01:39.480
I'm in the midst of healed people,

0:01:39.480,0:01:41.800
Amen! ! !
Applause! ! !

0:01:41.800,0:01:46.340
delivered people (Amen), blessed people! (Amen)

0:01:46.340,0:01:49.960
I know you'll like to hear that

0:01:49.960,0:01:59.220
When the Holy Spirit speaks,
 changes are beginning.

0:01:59.220,0:02:05.680
Whether you like it or not, changes are beginning.

0:02:05.680,0:02:10.000
I want to say to you - you will not remain and you will not go the same.

0:02:10.000,0:02:16.280
Amen! ! !
Applause! ! !

0:02:16.280,0:02:21.100
Because we are still standing on His Word.

0:02:21.100,0:02:26.900
His Word says, "Let there be light!"

0:02:26.900,0:02:30.720
That is the promise of His Word.

0:02:30.720,0:02:37.260
Are you sick? 
Let the sick come.

0:02:37.260,0:02:42.480
We are still standing on His Word

0:02:42.480,0:02:49.680
and His assurance of salvation.

0:02:49.680,0:02:55.480
Let us raise up on our feet.

0:02:55.480,0:03:04.720
Jesus has given so much capacity to learn from our mistakes, our errors.

0:03:04.720,0:03:07.640
That is why you are here today.

0:03:07.640,0:03:12.560
If there was no capacity to learn from your errors, you would not be here today.

0:03:12.560,0:03:17.140
There are some errors you committed that would have lead to death.

0:03:17.140,0:03:21.420
Many errors that you committed in the past that would have lead to death,

0:03:21.420,0:03:25.660
by now they would be pointing to your graveyard.

0:03:25.660,0:03:30.760
Many that are in the graveyard, they have never done so much that you have done.

0:03:30.760,0:03:35.000
When you think back, many that are in the graveyard today.

0:03:35.000,0:03:41.020
Many of them they have not committed the error, mistake you have committed.

0:03:41.020,0:03:48.720
but today they are pointing to the graveyard,
their dream crushed.

0:03:48.720,0:03:51.840
These are the testimonies you are supposed to be giving -

0:03:51.860,0:03:59.880
so much capacity to learn from our mistakes,
our errors and move on.

0:03:59.880,0:04:02.660
That is why you are here.

0:04:02.660,0:04:08.320
You have done so much that would have lead to graveyard,

0:04:08.320,0:04:18.760
that would have lead to death, or sick-bed, 
but here you are! ! !

0:04:18.760,0:04:28.800
God has given us so much capacity to learn from our errors, mistakes.

0:04:28.800,0:04:39.520
Bow down your head now and ask God to give you enough grace to learn from your errors,

0:04:39.520,0:04:48.800
mistakes and move on.

0:04:48.840,0:04:59.820
Mistakes will come; you will learn 
and not fail and move on.

0:04:59.820,0:05:00.640
Bow down your head.

0:05:00.640,0:05:18.620
Ask God to give you enough grace to continue to learn from your errors, mistakes.

0:05:18.620,0:05:29.340
Ask God for grace. He has given you but He can still increase that capacity.

0:05:29.340,0:05:33.280
There is no limit to the grace of God.

0:05:33.280,0:05:38.220
What you have today can be increased, can be multiplied; that is why you are here.

0:05:38.220,0:05:45.700
Ask God! Grace, Lord!
GRACE! ! ! GRACE! ! !

0:05:45.700,0:06:01.140
Enough grace to learn from my error, mistake.

0:06:01.140,0:06:04.100
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:06:04.100,0:06:06.100
Amen!!!

0:06:06.100,0:06:19.840
Mistakes will come so far as you are still living 
- in the flesh

0:06:19.840,0:06:27.320
and you will learn and move on.

0:06:27.320,0:06:32.720
So, each time that mistake comes, it is not the mistake that matters,

0:06:32.720,0:06:36.540
but what you learn from it.

0:06:36.540,0:06:44.900
You say "Why, why this mistakes" -  never you say that when it comes.

0:06:44.900,0:06:50.460
You can count how many tests, examinations you've gone through,

0:06:50.460,0:06:55.940
each time you need promotion,
you should be ready for examination.

0:06:55.940,0:07:01.020
After passing the examination you'll be promoted.

0:07:01.020,0:07:08.840
Mistakes will come, don't bother yourself - why this mistakes, error, oh my God I am a christian,

0:07:08.840,0:07:13.520
why all this. No, no, no - it will come.

0:07:13.520,0:07:16.640
What if God allowed it???

0:07:16.640,0:07:20.080
If the tempter has consulted God,

0:07:20.080,0:07:22.480
"Allow me to test this man".

0:07:22.480,0:07:24.480
If God allows it?

0:07:24.480,0:07:26.480
What will you do???

0:07:26.480,0:07:35.360
Issue of why all this, "I failed this examination. Oh my God, I am a Christian," - don't let that affect your faith.

0:07:35.360,0:07:46.000
It is time to apply your faith.
Not to bother.

0:07:46.000,0:07:48.940
Mistakes will come.
Tell your neighbour.

0:07:48.940,0:07:52.320
I mean, errors will come.

0:07:52.320,0:07:55.820
You will learn and move on.

0:07:55.820,0:08:00.680
There's capacity. 
There's ability.

0:08:00.680,0:08:04.160
He never promised to keep you away.

0:08:04.160,0:08:14.520
He never promised to keep you away from mistakes
because he has given you capacity.

0:08:14.520,0:08:21.420
He has given you grace.

0:08:21.420,0:08:27.220
No mistake, no grace.

0:08:27.220,0:08:37.560
He never promised to keep you away from all these - challenges, temptation, whatever

0:08:37.560,0:08:42.260
but He promised to see you through.

0:08:42.260,0:08:53.700
If gold must be gold, If gold must be gold... 
If you must be a Christian...

0:08:53.700,0:08:58.440
You are to answer that.

0:08:58.440,0:09:02.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:02.980,0:09:04.220
Tell your neighbor again! ! !

0:09:04.220,0:09:10.400
If gold must be gold, 
if you must be a Christian...

0:09:10.400,0:09:15.980
You should answer that question.

0:09:15.980,0:09:21.000
What takes gold to be gold is
what takes you to be a Christian.

0:09:21.000,0:09:23.860
If gold must be gold,
it must pass through furnace.

0:09:23.860,0:09:31.020
If you must be a Christian,
you must pass through temptations and trials.

0:09:31.020,0:09:36.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:36.740,0:09:42.000
Those things that you would have smiled when it come! ! !

0:09:42.000,0:09:44.540
"Ahh!! Why this trouble?"

0:09:44.540,0:09:48.640
Promotion is coming; get ready to pass through it.

0:09:48.640,0:09:52.660
You are now complaining.

0:09:52.660,0:09:58.080
To get ready to be promoted to G.M., you must also be ready to go through some test.

0:09:58.080,0:10:01.040
To see whether you will be qualified to be G.M.

0:10:01.040,0:10:06.840
If gold must be gold,
it must pass through furnace.

0:10:06.840,0:10:19.700
If you must be a faithful Christian, your character must be tested through rare situations.

0:10:19.700,0:10:22.980
Your test may be different from my test.

0:10:22.980,0:10:28.160
Yours may be sickness! ! !

0:10:28.160,0:10:34.080
Mr. B may be hardship.

0:10:34.080,0:10:40.460
Mr. C may be accusation.

0:10:40.460,0:10:50.480
Mr. D maybe affliction.

0:10:50.480,0:10:54.160
E - maybe limitation in progress.

0:10:54.160,0:10:58.040
There some messages you don't need to sit down and receive,

0:10:58.040,0:11:04.700
threy are many messages you must have to stand and receive; that is why you are standing.

0:11:04.700,0:11:10.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:10.700,0:11:16.520
I need your body, soul, spirit attention.

0:11:16.520,0:11:19.840
Take this:

0:11:19.840,0:11:29.700
what takes gold to be gold also 
 takes you to be a true believer.

0:11:29.700,0:11:36.360
Each challenge either moves you forwards or backwards.

0:11:36.360,0:11:44.720
When the Holy Spirit speaks, changes are beginning.

0:11:44.720,0:11:47.060
That is Holy Spirit.

0:11:47.060,0:11:59.700
A man has the ability to speak but the Holy Spirit speaks

0:11:59.700,0:12:05.840
and when He speaks, changes are beginning.

0:12:05.840,0:12:08.800
You must identify, who speaks to you.

0:12:08.800,0:12:14.200
A man will walk towards you and speak to you,

0:12:14.200,0:12:23.140
and, a man will walk towards you and the Holy Spirit will speak to you through him.

0:12:23.140,0:12:25.840
Who is speaking?

0:12:25.840,0:12:33.780
Anyone can say, "Jesus is Lord" but not everyone can say it genuinely.

0:12:33.780,0:12:39.000
Anyone can say, "Be healed in the name of Jesus!",

0:12:39.000,0:12:43.760
"Be delivered!", anybody can say, "Be blessed in the name of Jesus!"

0:12:43.760,0:12:51.300
Anyone can say, "Rise up and pray!" If i give you the mic now, you will say it.

0:12:51.300,0:13:04.560
To make a change, you must stand on His Word and on the assurance of salvation.

0:13:04.560,0:13:10.560
By salvation you can be healed,

0:13:10.560,0:13:14.600
because that salvation will help to maintain the healing.

0:13:14.600,0:13:18.720
If you receive without salvation, you cannot maintain it.

0:13:18.720,0:13:23.240
As you receive, it's gone.

0:13:23.240,0:13:27.860
You can be healed by salvation.

0:13:27.860,0:13:32.080
Nothing goes for nothing and nothing comes by chance.

0:13:32.080,0:13:43.960
Salvation!! Have healing, blessing, breakthrough.

0:13:43.960,0:13:48.080
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:13:48.080,0:13:53.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:53.460,0:13:59.900
You have a role to play; the prayer is not just one-sided.

0:13:59.900,0:14:07.480
As you are sitting, continue to meditate; your meditation brings results.

0:14:07.480,0:14:13.080
With your heart, you see Jesus; with your heart, you walk with Him.

0:14:13.080,0:14:17.020
You agree with Him with your heart.

0:14:17.020,0:14:19.620
And you must take control of your heart,

0:14:19.620,0:14:23.000
because our heart is just like this.

0:14:23.000,0:14:27.860
As you are sitting down if you don't take hold of your heart, as I am talking your heart will be telling you;

0:14:27.860,0:14:35.560
"Who is this man?Look at him.@

0:14:35.560,0:14:40.960
You must take hold!!! Arrest your heart.

0:14:40.960,0:14:47.280
It's not too late now, as I am talking to you. Your heart - let it look, where you look.

0:14:47.280,0:14:50.560
Begin to say, "Take more of me, give me more of You".

0:14:50.560,0:14:52.280
Begin to engage your heart.

0:14:52.280,0:14:55.520
If you don't engage your heart as you are looking at me,

0:14:55.520,0:14:59.960
you will be looking one direction and your heart will be saying nonsense.

0:14:59.960,0:15:03.380
When you greet a person, "Good Morning, sir",

0:15:03.380,0:15:11.380
your heart will be saying, "See him, very proud man. I said 'good morning', and he refused to answer me".

0:15:11.380,0:15:13.800
You will greet, your heart will not greet.

0:15:13.800,0:15:20.700
We Christians, we take hold of our hearts in order to have accomplishments, results.

0:15:20.700,0:15:26.760
What you say "Be healed!" - your heart must also release that word.

0:15:26.760,0:15:28.960
Not you are saying, your heart releases it.

0:15:28.960,0:15:35.400
As you are looking at me now, begin to meditate in your heart , don't allow your heart to be silent.

0:15:35.400,0:15:43.240
Because we Christians, we are not walking by sight, we walk by ---- (Faith)

0:15:43.240,0:15:45.920
Do you know what the Bible calls faith? What is faith?

0:15:45.920,0:15:50.040
When you say you walk by faith, you mean you walk by heart.

0:15:50.040,0:15:57.180
If you are just going by your eyes, you will always have errors all the time.

0:15:57.180,0:16:00.480
But when you walk, you must walk by your heart.

0:16:00.480,0:16:03.820
The eyes of your heart must lead you.

0:16:03.820,0:16:11.360
As I am looking now; I am not only going by what I am seeing, but this heart is the one leading me.

0:16:11.360,0:16:13.660
The heart has eyes.

0:16:13.660,0:16:18.400
The Bible says, faith is of man's heart, meaning man's spirit.

0:16:18.400,0:16:26.460
So when you are sitting, you must also sit by your heart.

0:16:26.460,0:16:29.820
Anything that is not from your heart is a sin.

0:16:29.820,0:16:39.380
Your heart and your mouth must be in accord, in agreement.

0:16:39.380,0:16:45.680
If not, we would not be able to place you.

0:16:45.680,0:16:57.300
With our mouth we confess; with our heart we believe.

0:16:57.300,0:16:58.740
Salvation!!

0:16:58.740,0:17:04.400
With our mouth we confess; with our heart we believe.

0:17:04.400,0:17:08.660
This is the life you must begin to live.

0:17:08.660,0:17:13.480
Are you engaging your heart now?

0:17:13.480,0:17:16.200
"Take more of me, give me more of You."

0:17:16.200,0:17:24.660
If someone is even calling you, he must call all of you.

0:17:24.660,0:17:31.860
You are two natures in one person.

0:17:31.860,0:17:35.720
You and your divine.

0:17:35.720,0:17:38.860
"Take more of me, give me more of You."

0:17:38.860,0:17:43.280
This is a prayer we anointed for you.

0:17:43.280,0:17:49.160
You may have your own prayer, no doubt about that but because of your weakness,

0:17:49.160,0:17:53.100
the Lord gave us a word that is easy for you to communicate.

0:17:53.100,0:17:57.280
"Take more of me, give me more of You, Lord!"

0:17:57.280,0:18:03.900
"Your faithfulness, Your kindness, Your purity, Your holiness."

0:18:03.900,0:18:07.460
It's simply, just simple to communicate.

0:18:07.460,0:18:10.820
Begin to say that, engage your heart.

0:18:10.820,0:18:20.080
When you now engage your heart, you begin to have fulfillment, results.

0:18:20.080,0:18:29.840
We are like this because our heart, spirit is saying this,

0:18:29.840,0:18:35.300
your eyes are saing this.

0:18:35.300,0:18:40.680
You are seeing white and your heart is talking of a different thing.

0:18:40.680,0:18:44.500
You are greeting me, "Good Morning, Sir!",

0:18:44.500,0:18:46.780
and I say, "Thank you".

0:18:46.780,0:18:51.040
Your heart at the same time will say, "Why are you greeting Him?"

0:18:51.040,0:18:54.200
You will ask yourself, "Why I am greeting this man?

0:18:54.200,0:18:57.020
Well I will greet him, he is my Pastor."

0:18:57.020,0:18:58.840
That is our heart for you.

0:18:58.840,0:19:04.380
Your heart is always not agreeing, not in accordance with whatever you do.

0:19:04.380,0:19:07.020
So, arrest your heart.

0:19:07.020,0:19:14.360
Once you are able to get this, you begin to walk in line with God.

0:19:14.360,0:19:19.480
As I am talking to you, I am also at the same time praying.

0:19:19.480,0:19:24.400
How is it possible for a man to be preaching and at the same time praying?

0:19:24.400,0:19:29.980
Yes, it's possible because I have two natures.

0:19:29.980,0:19:35.300
Two person's in one person.

0:19:35.300,0:19:38.360
It's possible.

0:19:38.360,0:19:43.400
Until you begin to live this kind of life you will overcome this world,

0:19:43.400,0:19:49.020
If not - a situation, where you say: "At 3pm I am going to pray", -

0:19:49.020,0:19:51.780
you can never overcome this world.

0:19:51.780,0:19:57.360
Tomorrow I will fast - fasting must be everyday.

0:19:57.360,0:20:05.980
The word "fasting" is abstaining from unrighteousness.

0:20:05.980,0:20:09.840
24/7 prayer.

0:20:09.840,0:20:15.560
Not when you enter the room you say, "I want to pray, I want to fast."

0:20:15.560,0:20:19.120
These are the areas satan is used to get you,

0:20:19.120,0:20:21.800
he knows, when you are not praying - he catches you.

0:20:21.800,0:20:23.800
Before you pray he catches you.

0:20:23.800,0:20:26.280
He knows, when you pray - he will not be able to catch you.

0:20:26.280,0:20:33.560
He will make sure he catches you before you pray.

0:20:33.560,0:20:36.480
Are you with me?

0:20:36.480,0:20:40.680
Are you communicating  in the spirit?

0:20:40.680,0:20:43.980
That is what we call spirit prayer.

0:20:43.980,0:20:48.500
If a man is a Christian you will know. He doesn't talk too much,

0:20:48.500,0:20:50.920
because you are the only person talking.

0:20:50.920,0:20:55.200
If there is another talk in the spirit, you can't talk too much,

0:20:55.200,0:21:01.160
you will wait for the One that talks underneath.

0:21:01.160,0:21:05.720
You are calling me, "Hello, Sir", I will say "Hello, what do you want?" - I will wait for you.

0:21:05.720,0:21:06.940
I will never talk like that.

0:21:06.940,0:21:15.140
I will say, "Hello!" I will pause. You thin,k I don't hear what you are saying - I am praying underneath.

0:21:15.140,0:21:21.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:21.120,0:21:29.580
People say eloquent speech, "Hello, Jesus is Lord", because he is the only person talking.

0:21:29.580,0:21:33.480
"Jesus is Lord!" At what time do you wait for the Holy Spirit to talk?

0:21:33.480,0:21:43.340
The One that controls you? Nobody controls you; you are the one talking.

0:21:43.340,0:21:47.320
You want to display the skill, what about the One that gives you the word?

0:21:47.320,0:21:58.360
Why can't you pause, hear from Him and say what He wants you to say?

0:21:58.360,0:22:02.780
So when you pick a phone, "Oh hello, sir!"

0:22:02.780,0:22:11.320
I am ready. I must hear from the One, my Controller what to say.

0:22:11.320,0:22:14.440
I must hear from my Commander what to say.

0:22:14.440,0:22:17.520
I must hear from my Instructor what to say.

0:22:17.520,0:22:26.900
"Hello, sir, hello! I'll just say, let me greet you." - "Thank you!"

0:22:26.900,0:22:35.840
At the same time, I am praying in the spirit.

0:22:35.840,0:22:40.520
"Can you hear me, sir?" - "I hear you quite alright."

0:22:40.520,0:22:46.140
You think, I don't hear you. I hear you, because I am not alone.

0:22:46.140,0:22:53.260
If I am not alone, I must hear from Him who sent me.

0:22:53.260,0:23:00.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:00.560,0:23:11.240
You cannot continue serving God with physical strength, eloquent speech, your eyes or mouth.

0:23:11.240,0:23:15.660
You must serve Him with all your heart.

0:23:15.660,0:23:21.520
The first place we must grow or prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:23:21.520,0:23:25.520
Let me share with you why it's so difficult for us,

0:23:25.520,0:23:35.960
after you have made a lot of money, you are rich, fleet of cars, companies, you have a lot -

0:23:35.960,0:23:39.620
yet there is a burden. Why?

0:23:39.620,0:23:41.980
Because

0:23:41.980,0:23:54.800
it's like we are prospering in our financial life, material life and everything - but in our spiritual life we are zero.

0:23:54.800,0:24:17.240
You have money, wealth so much, you have people, yet there is so much burden.

0:24:17.240,0:24:22.560
Hardly you will be able to sleep, but you are not sick.

0:24:22.560,0:24:34.580
You need help of drugs, tablets to sleep.

0:24:34.580,0:24:44.560
You cannot seat down any longer alone for 3 to 4 hours, you need to be in the midst of people to be happy.

0:24:44.560,0:24:50.760
Created joy, joy that is created - not the joy of the Lord.

0:24:50.760,0:25:02.740
So, people will make you happy, you need go to party, club house, occasion, medical checkup,

0:25:02.740,0:25:06.700
you need to go for holiday every week just to be happy.

0:25:06.700,0:25:14.220
You are just looking for joy, the one you have is not sustaining you.

0:25:14.220,0:25:19.240
Now reverse is the case; our spiritual life first!!

0:25:19.240,0:25:24.720
Because this spiritual life is the one that carries everything we have.

0:25:24.720,0:25:31.280
It carries our money, property, fame it is the spiritual life that carries it.

0:25:31.280,0:25:38.580
If something that carries you is very small, the weight will be too much for him.

0:25:38.580,0:25:48.600
The life many of us live is like you as a person carries this.

0:25:48.600,0:25:53.160
If you carry this, you will soon get tired.

0:25:53.160,0:25:55.580
Your spiritual life is like that.

0:25:55.580,0:25:58.880
What carries you is your spiritual life.

0:25:58.880,0:26:14.660
It's not your money, material, fame, popularity that carries you, wealth - no!!

0:26:14.660,0:26:17.900
What carries you, is your spiritual life.

0:26:17.900,0:26:25.080
And what you have is so much for your spiritual life to carry.

0:26:25.080,0:26:29.980
So your spiritual life is just...

0:26:29.980,0:26:35.960
That is why life is so difficult for many of us, with your money, property.

0:26:35.960,0:26:40.040
You keep asking yourself, "I have money why should I be suffering,

0:26:40.040,0:26:47.080
I have fame, companies all over the world. Why should I be suffering?"

0:26:47.080,0:26:53.000
Yes; because the person that is carrying you is carrying so much load, property

0:26:53.000,0:26:58.600
and he is the one who is supposed to be a giant and those thing are supposed to be small.

0:26:58.600,0:27:04.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:04.840,0:27:07.440
I want you to work on that.

0:27:07.440,0:27:15.040
God has given us a capacity to learn from our challenges.

0:27:15.040,0:27:19.540
So, if you don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.

0:27:19.540,0:27:20.160
Tell your neighbour.

0:27:20.160,0:27:27.960
You don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.

0:27:27.960,0:27:28.820
Tell your neighbour again.

0:27:28.820,0:27:34.680
You don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.

0:27:34.680,0:27:40.080
What lesson will you learn from breakthrough?

0:27:40.080,0:27:42.760
What lesson will you learn from pleasure?

0:27:42.760,0:27:45.220
We learn much from challenges.

0:27:45.220,0:27:50.880
Your challenges could be sickness, poverty or temptation.

0:27:50.880,0:27:56.500
You don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.

0:27:56.500,0:28:03.560
You don't want to learn, you don't want to move forward.

0:28:03.560,0:28:11.640
Challenges will come; you will learn and move on.

0:28:11.640,0:28:16.600
You know the process of a seed growing.

0:28:16.600,0:28:28.840
When you plant seeds, you water them, you nurture them.

0:28:28.840,0:28:37.400
Why should you water seeds? Because of seasons - the dry season and rainy season.

0:28:37.400,0:28:46.380
You nurture them, you keep them away from insects, birds.

0:28:46.380,0:28:50.940
You try to remove weeds around it.

0:28:50.940,0:29:00.160
These are the challenges seeds have, before they grow and become beneficial to you.

0:29:00.160,0:29:11.400
In the same vein, you are a seed growing.

0:29:11.400,0:29:23.160
If your faith is lifted up, let me see your hand.

0:29:23.160,0:29:26.300
I would like to ask you a question before I leave you.

0:29:26.300,0:29:28.560
And I want somebody

0:29:28.560,0:29:31.820
from the heart

0:29:31.820,0:29:34.580
to answer this question.

0:29:34.580,0:29:37.880
How does this message appeal to you?

0:29:37.880,0:29:43.060
Don't rely on yourself but on the Holy Spirit

0:29:43.060,0:29:47.920
because the burden will arrive, challenges will come.

0:29:47.920,0:29:54.020
If you rely on yourself, you will not hold it, stand it or maintain it.

0:29:54.020,0:29:57.240
But with the Holy Spirit you will go forward.

0:29:57.240,0:30:01.320
You need challenges to learn and to move forward.

0:30:01.320,0:30:07.740
What are the challenges we are talking about?

0:30:07.740,0:30:10.380
Problems of life.

0:30:10.380,0:30:11.640
Thank you!!!

0:30:11.640,0:30:16.020
Clap for her!!

0:30:16.020,0:30:17.660
You listen to that?

0:30:17.660,0:30:20.720
She said we need challenges.

0:30:20.720,0:30:26.680
There are some challenges you cause by yourself.

0:30:26.680,0:30:34.880
When you cause a challenge and it comes, God will withdraw His strength for you to face it.

0:30:34.880,0:30:46.460
You decide to look for sugar, eat ice cream, eat sugar,

0:30:46.460,0:30:50.000
and you say you like the food.

0:30:50.000,0:30:53.200
What will you expect? (Diabetes)

0:30:53.200,0:30:56.540
And when it comes, you will face it on your own.

0:30:56.540,0:31:02.320
God will withdraw His strength from you to face the diabetes.

0:31:02.320,0:31:11.860
Without God, you will be defeated, destroyed, you will die.

0:31:11.860,0:31:14.820
Emmanuel!!! (God with us)

0:31:14.820,0:31:18.900
I have learnt today from our Senior Prophet TB Joshua that

0:31:18.900,0:31:24.980
being a human being we must pass through some challenges

0:31:24.980,0:31:34.560
because before gold must be gold it must pass through fire.

0:31:34.560,0:31:45.360
So, before a Christian is a real true born again Christian, he must pass through some challenges.

0:31:45.360,0:31:48.520
Thank you.

0:31:48.520,0:31:52.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:52.500,0:32:00.000
Brother, can you just give us more, what challenges are you going through now?

0:32:00.000,0:32:08.080
The challenges can be sickness... --- I say, you.

0:32:08.080,0:32:13.600
Just tell us one of the challenges because  everyone here has 1,2 or 3.

0:32:13.600,0:32:16.800
Family Challenges!!

0:32:16.800,0:32:19.680
That is disunity,

0:32:19.680,0:32:22.840
so that is it which is common.

0:32:22.840,0:32:27.700
The question now is: if you are not the cause -

0:32:27.700,0:32:32.100
because some of us this issue of family we are the cause.

0:32:32.100,0:32:39.300
We cause it and when we cause it, in that sense God withdraws His power and leaves us to face it.

0:32:39.300,0:32:43.180
So, thank you, brother, thank you very much!!

0:32:43.180,0:32:44.160
God bless you!!!

0:32:44.160,0:32:48.040
