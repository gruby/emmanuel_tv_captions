0:00:25.320,0:00:38.140

0:00:38.140,0:00:43.060
Lord I come to know

0:00:43.060,0:00:47.760
Lord I come to know

0:00:47.760,0:00:55.420
The weaknesses I see in me

0:00:55.420,0:01:02.700
Will be stripped away

0:01:02.700,0:01:12.900

0:01:47.760,0:01:55.840

And I will soar with You

0:01:59.780,0:02:03.060

0:02:12.720,0:02:28.020
Hold me close

0:02:28.020,0:02:42.680
Bring me near 
Draw me to Your side

0:02:42.680,0:02:55.720
And as I wait I'll rise like an eagle

0:02:55.720,0:02:59.540
And I will soar with You

0:02:59.540,0:03:03.220
Your Spirit leads me on

0:03:03.220,0:03:49.540

0:03:49.540,0:04:05.620

South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:05:45.560,0:05:53.160
This is just a word of exhortation.

0:05:53.160,0:06:01.700
So let's take our Bible to the Book of Psalm.

0:06:01.700,0:06:19.440
The Book of Psalm 66:18.

0:06:19.440,0:06:36.100
"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened."

0:06:36.100,0:06:43.980
Let's take our Bible also to the Book of Matthew 5.

0:06:43.980,0:06:55.960
It's related to that Book of Psalm 66:18.

0:06:55.960,0:06:59.640
Let's read verse 8.

0:06:59.640,0:07:12.980
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see Jesus."

0:07:12.980,0:07:19.620
It's all about heart.

0:07:19.620,0:07:39.760
Psalm 66:18 says: "If I cherish iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."

0:07:39.760,0:07:47.320
In this Matthew 5:8 it says:

0:07:47.320,0:07:54.220
"Blessed are the pure in heart..."

0:07:54.220,0:08:03.300
Take note: If I cherish iniquity in my heart,

0:08:03.300,0:08:08.400
the Lord will not hear me.

0:08:08.400,0:08:13.680
Heart, heart, heart...

0:08:13.680,0:08:17.480
What does this mean to us?

0:08:17.480,0:08:28.760
It means the greatest thing the Lord looks into is our heart.

0:08:28.760,0:08:42.320
The greatest thing, the most cherished thing the Lord looks into is our heart.

0:08:42.320,0:08:53.660
We are made in our hearts to be like Jesus.

0:08:53.660,0:09:07.780
Whatever colour, race, appearance - it does not matter.

0:09:07.780,0:09:29.120
Whether you are black, yellow, red - whatever colour - the judgment will be based on our heart,

0:09:29.120,0:09:39.100
that is the content of our character.

0:09:39.100,0:09:40.060
Yes.

0:09:40.060,0:09:46.800
We are made in our hearts to be like Him.

0:09:46.800,0:09:57.660
If you cherish iniquity in your heart, the Lord will not hear you.

0:09:57.660,0:10:13.200
This is why only faith pleases God and the faith is of man's heart.

0:10:13.200,0:10:23.180
When we say 'heart', we mean 'the spirit of man' - biblically.

0:10:23.180,0:10:26.660
Heart.

0:10:26.660,0:10:40.220
Whatever appearance, colour, race - it does not matter.

0:10:40.220,0:10:47.900
Heart.

0:10:47.900,0:11:01.820
With a pure heart, a man knows that Jesus is Lord.

0:11:01.820,0:11:13.160
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus is righteousness.

0:11:13.160,0:11:23.920
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves.

0:11:23.920,0:11:34.380
With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus heals.

0:11:34.380,0:11:49.020
If you cherish iniquity, that is sin, if your honour iniquity in your heart,

0:11:49.020,0:11:54.020
the Lord will not listen to you.

0:11:54.020,0:12:19.000
God listens, Jesus listens as you pray and He replies in relation to the state of your heart.

0:12:19.000,0:12:24.260
You say: "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!.."

0:12:24.260,0:12:42.980
He listens, replies in relation to the state of your heart.

0:12:42.980,0:13:00.800
If you hold grudges in your heart and you are saying "Jesus", you are wasting your time.

0:13:00.800,0:13:20.000
If you hold offence and you are saying "Jesus", you are wasting your time.

0:13:20.000,0:13:28.280
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:13:28.280,0:13:54.700
If you hold offence in your heart, don't be surprised if the Bible will make no meaning to you.

0:13:54.700,0:14:16.780
If you hold offence such as bitterness, grudges, anger, hatred and so forth and you open the Bible

0:14:16.780,0:14:33.580
and you hold offence against someone, against anyone and you are reading Bible, you are wasting your time.

0:14:33.580,0:14:40.320
You are reading literature.

0:14:40.320,0:14:49.200
This is The Book of books.

0:14:49.200,0:14:57.400
When you are reading it, you are reading the Holy Spirit.

0:14:57.400,0:15:02.660
Heart.

0:15:02.660,0:15:20.620
If we know we are made in our heart to be like Jesus, why are we fighting over colour?

0:15:20.620,0:15:32.420
Why short, why high? Why big stomach, why small stomach?

0:15:32.420,0:15:41.580
I want to be like Jesus in my heart.

0:15:41.580,0:15:59.660
If you hold offence in your heart, don't be surprised that your prayer will not be accepted.

0:15:59.660,0:16:04.920
My heart! Yes.

0:16:04.920,0:16:11.680
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:16:11.680,0:16:24.060
Finally, I will take you to the Book of Romans.

0:16:24.060,0:16:32.900
Romans 9:1.

0:16:32.900,0:16:53.180
"I speak the truth in Christ - I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit."

0:16:53.180,0:17:00.300
Today, the conscience is ignored,

0:17:00.300,0:17:11.560
which is the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses

0:17:11.560,0:17:19.680
to ride us, to push us and to guide us.

0:17:19.680,0:17:23.900
We ignore the conscience.

0:17:23.900,0:17:34.240
Today, we talk about the Holy Spirit, whereas the conscience - your heart,

0:17:34.240,0:17:54.620
which the Holy Spirit uses as a guide to the soul is ignored.

0:17:54.620,0:18:14.380
In order to pray effectively, there must not be anything between us and God.

0:18:14.380,0:18:30.100
The conscience we ignore is the very root, the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses to guide us.

0:18:30.100,0:18:42.800
So you say: "Holy, holy, holy!" whereas the heart is full of iniquity, holding grudges, holding hatred.

0:18:42.800,0:19:04.880
"Holy!.." - first talk to your heart.

0:19:04.880,0:19:12.040
When the Holy Spirit comes, if the heart is not free, it can't attract the Spirit of God.

0:19:12.040,0:19:22.880
We must allow our spirit to be free from grudges, hatred, bitterness before we can say: "Holy!"

0:19:22.880,0:19:49.900
If not, the Holy Spirit will come and move round without attending to you.

0:19:49.900,0:20:07.540
Our heart is the contact point, the communication point for the Holy Spirit

0:20:07.540,0:20:17.740
If the contact point is not free...

0:20:17.740,0:20:30.620
Your heart is the communication point; take care of your heart.

0:20:30.620,0:20:42.960
Free your heart from offence such as grudges, hatred and bitterness.

0:20:42.960,0:20:53.440
Free your heart!

0:20:53.440,0:20:57.720
You must free your heart.

0:20:57.720,0:21:03.740
Stop ignoring your heart.

0:21:03.740,0:21:09.920
It is the contact point of the Holy Spirit.

0:21:09.920,0:21:10.560
Tell your neighbour.

0:21:10.560,0:21:24.200
Stop ignoring your heart; it's the contact point of the Holy Spirit.

0:21:24.200,0:21:30.960
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:21:30.960,0:21:37.120
Contact point of the Holy Spirit.

0:21:37.120,0:21:48.440
It is essential for every Christian to be free of offence.

0:21:48.440,0:21:53.820
What you are facing today is a result of offence.

0:21:53.820,0:22:10.120
Offence has opened the door to the various situations in your life.

0:22:10.120,0:22:15.360
Yes, that is offence.

0:22:15.360,0:22:21.380
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:22:21.380,0:22:27.220
Viewers, thank you.

0:22:27.220,0:22:34.720
South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:22:34.720,0:22:50.180
I was trying to counsel you yesterday concerning the issue of healing and deliverance.

0:22:50.180,0:23:04.760
It's not only healing or deliverance, help from God. If God sends you to help your neighbour,

0:23:04.760,0:23:23.460
the help that comes from the heart - we don't give that help first before you receive reward.

0:23:23.460,0:23:33.080
Let me give you a good example; issue of healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings.

0:23:33.080,0:23:56.820
No one can give money from the heart, before healing is given.

0:23:56.820,0:24:09.580
No one can give money from the heart before healing.

0:24:09.580,0:24:19.100
You can give money but that money is not from the heart.

0:24:19.100,0:24:30.020
No one can give money from the heart before healing and God's blessings.

0:24:30.020,0:24:38.760
And anything given that is not from the heart is a sin.

0:24:38.760,0:24:48.620
If you give me this and it is not  from your heart, it will not bless me.

0:24:48.620,0:24:57.260
I would use it but it will not bless my life.

0:24:57.260,0:25:10.820
But if you now give me from your heart, it will bless me and bless my future.

0:25:10.820,0:25:23.920
Money should not be exchanged for God's blessing.

0:25:23.920,0:25:41.980
If I deliver you and you are free, whatever you give me after that will come from your heart.

0:25:41.980,0:25:49.820
And it will bless my life, now and forever.

0:25:49.820,0:25:57.840
God has a way of talking to people's hearts.

0:25:57.840,0:26:06.280
Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings are hindered by the way and manner

0:26:06.280,0:26:17.540
we go about the issue of money.

0:26:17.540,0:26:30.800
That is why you see the fire of revival is going down.

0:26:30.800,0:26:44.160
The fire of revival is going down.

0:26:44.160,0:27:04.760
When we give freely as we are given by God, God will raise His people to bless you in abundance.

0:27:04.760,0:27:15.660
When it is time for revival, it is time for sacrifice.

0:27:15.660,0:27:22.640
It's always good to sacrifice first before receiving.

0:27:22.640,0:27:30.440
Sacrifice means labour before reward. By the time reward comes, it will come in a way

0:27:30.440,0:27:48.740
that will bless your career, your future forever.

0:27:48.740,0:28:02.400
God bless you. This is my message and I will continue to preach this anywhere.

0:28:02.400,0:28:06.960
Hallelujah!
