My name is Hugh Mtshali. I am from South Africa.

0:00:04.300,0:00:11.840
I am the CEO and a businessman and by profession I am an analitical chemist.

0:00:11.840,0:00:17.500
And next to me is my business partner.

0:00:17.500,0:00:25.060
One of my businesses is in the manufacturing of healthcare products.

0:00:25.060,0:00:35.520
It's one of the most important products, where we supply the government of South Africa.

0:00:35.520,0:00:40.620
The business has been around for more than twenty years.

0:00:40.620,0:00:48.880
At some stage, about ten years ago we started experiencing some issues in the business.

0:00:48.880,0:00:56.320
The business had financial challenges, we then had some attacks.

0:00:56.320,0:01:01.220
Because of those attacks, we thought: "What is going wrong?"

0:01:01.220,0:01:13.080
We called upon other third party agencies to come over and test our product to see, if anything was wrong.

0:01:13.080,0:01:15.320
or if there was anything we could improve.

0:01:15.320,0:01:19.300
But then we found out that there was nothing wrong with our product.

0:01:19.300,0:01:28.580
I tried to speak to some influential people to see what kind of intervention they could bring

0:01:28.580,0:01:31.780
in this whole challenge that we were facing.

0:01:31.780,0:01:40.540
Our business appointed more than two hundred people and most of them were black women,

0:01:40.540,0:01:50.400
unemployed people. So we thought: "Let's take them from poverty and unemployment and give decent jobs."

0:01:50.400,0:01:57.980
But then, when we started getting those challenges because we weren't able to sell the product

0:01:57.980,0:02:04.080
because it could not be approved, to be tested.

0:02:04.080,0:02:11.500
We went to get some funding debt from a bank in South Africa.

0:02:11.500,0:02:18.460
And then, at some stage, this attack led us to the fact that we couldn't service the debt.

0:02:18.460,0:02:27.500
So then we started getting into problems and it just went on and on. And it really affected me, big time.

0:02:27.500,0:02:38.560
At some stage, we were coming from a place in Pumalanga and I found that my blood pressure

0:02:38.560,0:02:46.020
was very high. So that was the stress that the business had on me, personally.

0:02:46.020,0:02:58.960
So I was hospitalized for about a week and my BP was at about 220, that could cause a stroke.

0:02:58.980,0:03:08.280
After we received help from the bank, we were unable to service the debt.

0:03:08.280,0:03:16.920
We tried everything. We tried everything humanly possible.

0:03:16.920,0:03:31.560
My colleague kept on telling me about Emmanuel TV: "Try Emmanuel TV, pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua."

0:03:31.560,0:03:41.840
And then I said: "Ok, I will give it a try at some time." And then the bank sent us these papers, letters of demand,

0:03:41.900,0:03:47.320
meaning that they wanted their money, otherwise we were going to get into trouble.

0:03:47.320,0:03:55.120
It stressed my wife, Naomi, big time. And then we were about to undertake this trip to New York

0:03:55.160,0:04:00.520
where my daughter was studying. At some stage she wanted to cancel the trip saying:

0:04:00.520,0:04:09.680
"How are we going to travel whilst we are in pain", she was like: "We don't want our houses, our properties

0:04:09.680,0:04:19.860
to be repossessed."  So I said: "Ok, we'll make a plan."  Then I took up the advise from my business partner

0:04:19.860,0:04:28.460
and said: "We'll just pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua, when he prompts you to touch the screen."

0:04:28.460,0:04:37.880
So what I did was that I took those papers from the bank and as he was prompting us to pray along,

0:04:37.880,0:04:46.580
I took those papers and put them onto the screen. And the debt was millions and millions of rents, big millions.

0:04:46.580,0:04:50.620
So I put the papers on the screen.

0:04:50.620,0:04:52.180
The papers from the bank?

0:04:52.180,0:04:59.060
Yes, from the bank. Those are letters of demand and this was no game. I put them along and I prayed along.

0:04:59.060,0:05:08.120
As I put my papers on the screen, I felt some energy.

0:05:08.120,0:05:09.700
You felt?..

0:05:09.700,0:05:16.760
Energy. I will put it in the human language: "Zzz!" Alright?

0:05:16.760,0:05:23.740
So that was obviously the power of God. It happened, I put the papers away.

0:05:23.740,0:05:37.880
My wife kept on saying:  "Why are we going?" We left and I kept saying her:  "You know, things will be alright.

0:05:37.880,0:05:52.620
Don't be afraid." And nine days later, while we were overseas, I saw this email letter from the bank.

0:05:52.620,0:06:02.140
I read it once, twice, thrice. It kept on saying the same thing: "The debt has been cancelled."

0:06:02.140,0:06:03.580
I said: "No, it can't be."

0:06:03.580,0:06:09.700
Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!

0:06:09.700,0:06:16.000
After that, didn't show my wife something I wasn't sure about

0:06:16.000,0:06:19.120
because then I would get a smack.

0:06:19.120,0:06:29.120
I was strong enough in my resolve to show it to my wife. I didn't even want to talk or say anything,

0:06:29.120,0:06:40.100
I just showed her the letter. She read it. She cried. She said:  "Is it real?" I said:  "Well, that's what it says."

0:06:40.100,0:06:48.200
So she read it again. I then thought: "Ok, let me phone our business partners back in South Africa

0:06:48.200,0:06:52.920
to say: "Are we on the same page?  Are you reading what I'm reading?"

0:06:52.920,0:07:01.120
Then they said: "Hugh, we've been looking for you because of this." Basically, what that letter says is:

0:07:01.120,0:07:08.860
"Debt has been cancelled for one day to sign to agree, whether you want your debt to be cancelled or not."

0:07:08.860,0:07:18.600
Number one. Number two, it said: "You have been selected to qualify for a certain program."

0:07:18.600,0:07:21.860
Which I never applied for.

0:07:21.860,0:07:23.180
So...

0:07:23.180,0:07:29.080
Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:07:29.080,0:07:37.900
So, I was hit with two miracles at the same time. Of course, I signed it off immediately

0:07:37.900,0:07:46.860
and I sent it back to South Africa. We checked, if that letter was authentic and yes, it was authentic.

0:07:46.860,0:07:53.500
We spoke to the bank, the bank said: "We've been waiting for your signature." So I thought

0:07:53.500,0:08:05.260
it's highly imperative for me. This is my first time here at The SCOAN to share this wonderful testimony.

0:08:05.260,0:08:13.400
I wouldn't have hidden it because you don't hide things from God. It would be a travesty.

0:08:13.400,0:08:22.100
I want those blessings from God.  So, I tested Him and He intervened at the right time.

0:08:22.100,0:08:31.600
So, it shows that God's time was perfect because during that trip it was traumatic, I kept a brave face

0:08:31.600,0:08:46.800
to my wife to say: "It's going to be fine."  Although, I felt worried. But I had that belief to give God a chance.

0:08:46.800,0:08:55.780
So the debt is zero. I'm here to give this testimony to the wonderful people.

0:08:55.780,0:09:01.100
Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:09:01.100,0:09:13.640
Give God a chance at all times. Trust in Him. He is the biggest intervention, strategy, plan - whatever you may call it.

0:09:13.640,0:09:21.380
Whether you are a CEO, a chairman, whether you are experienced in business for hundred years,

0:09:21.380,0:09:28.260
whatever you are - trust in the living God, give Him a chance and He will come through for you.

0:09:28.260,0:09:32.120
Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.

0:09:32.120,0:09:33.040
Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
Emmanuel TV Testimony

0:09:33.040,0:09:38.680
Yes, indeed, it is obvious that after our brother had exhausted all his emotional and mental resources,

0:09:38.680,0:09:45.360
he definitely had to trust in Someone who is smarter, stronger and wiser which is our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

0:09:45.360,0:09:49.640
And today we can see the evidence of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who had indeed transformed

0:09:49.640,0:09:55.320
not only your life and your business at large. We thank God for your life and we just want to tell you

0:09:55.320,0:10:00.500
that now that God Almighty has done this wonderful thing for you, continue to honour Him, follow Him

0:10:00.500,0:10:06.160
and receive instruction from Him and we pray that God Almighty will give you grace to be a good leader

0:10:06.160,0:10:07.460
in Jesus' Name.

0:10:07.460,0:10:10.000
Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
