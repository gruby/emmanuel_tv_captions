0:00:00.000,0:00:03.800
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:03.800,0:00:05.340
Hallelujah!

0:00:05.340,0:00:08.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:08.480,0:00:16.620
Viewers at home, wherever you are, we salute your faith.

0:00:16.620,0:00:20.280
Thank You, Lord!

0:00:20.280,0:00:27.040
We continue to move according to the Spirit of God wave.

0:00:27.040,0:00:31.060
When He waves this direction, we follow; that direction, we follow.

0:00:31.060,0:00:34.780
That is the message you are receiving every week.

0:00:34.780,0:00:41.100
Like the issue of Holy Spirit - the Spirit of Father.

0:00:41.100,0:00:43.320
Hallelujah!

0:00:43.320,0:00:48.680
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:00:48.680,0:00:55.720
If you don't know the Holy Spirit, you cannot know Jesus.

0:00:55.720,0:00:57.840
I know Jesus; I know the Holy Spirit.

0:00:57.840,0:01:02.360
If you don't know the Holy Spirit, you cannot know Jesus.

0:01:02.360,0:01:05.820
This is the issue we are going to talk about today.

0:01:05.820,0:01:11.220
Our title:
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:01:11.220,0:01:12.840
Let someone say:

0:01:12.840,0:01:16.660
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:01:16.660,0:01:20.100
If you say you know Jesus without knowing the Holy Spirit,

0:01:20.100,0:01:24.060
that is not Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:01:24.060,0:01:30.120
He is a Spirit and His worshippers must do so in spirit and truth.

0:01:30.120,0:01:33.320
What kind of Jesus are we talking about?

0:01:33.320,0:01:36.860
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:01:36.860,0:01:39.220
Hallelujah!

0:01:39.220,0:01:44.400
We take our text from various books:

0:01:44.400,0:01:54.080
1 Corinthians 2:1-end.

0:01:54.080,0:02:01.840
John 16 - you can take your reading from the beginning.

0:02:01.840,0:02:06.360
John 3:27 -

0:02:06.360,0:02:10.820
it will give you some clue of what we are about to talk about today.

0:02:10.820,0:02:16.080
2 Corinthians 5:7 - about faith.

0:02:16.080,0:02:22.120
2 Corinthians 4:18 - that one too will help you.

0:02:22.120,0:02:23.660
Thank you.

0:02:23.660,0:02:30.760
Let's take our reading from the book of 1 Corinthians 2.

0:02:30.760,0:02:36.460
"And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you,

0:02:36.460,0:02:46.260
I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God."

0:02:46.260,0:02:47.320
Verse 2.

0:02:47.320,0:02:58.240
"For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified."

0:02:58.240,0:02:59.900
Verse 3.

0:02:59.900,0:03:05.240
"I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.

0:03:05.240,0:03:12.480
My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words,

0:03:12.480,0:03:16.880
but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,"

0:03:16.880,0:03:18.000
Verse 5.

0:03:18.000,0:03:26.820
"so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power."

0:03:26.820,0:03:28.540
Hallelujah.

0:03:28.540,0:03:33.040
When you now go down, you will find God's wisdom revealed by the Spirit.

0:03:33.040,0:03:34.780
This is verse 6.

0:03:34.780,0:03:43.640
"We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature,

0:03:43.640,0:03:48.960
but not the wisom of this age or of the rulers of this age..."

0:03:48.960,0:03:52.360
Take your time to read to the end.

0:03:52.360,0:03:55.320
Many other books have been given to you.

0:03:55.320,0:03:57.320
Hallelujah.

0:03:57.320,0:04:04.580
Taking your reading from verse 1 to the end of 1 Corinthians 2,

0:04:04.580,0:04:16.600
you will find that the Spirit is the organ by which we apprehend divine things;

0:04:16.600,0:04:21.580
man's spirit is dead because of sin.

0:04:21.580,0:04:37.240
The natural man - that is, the man of mind and the intellect - cannot understand

0:04:37.240,0:04:43.320
nor receive things of the Spirit.

0:04:43.320,0:04:46.160
Where there is no vision, people perish.

0:04:46.160,0:04:50.540
And this is what is going on now; this is what is happening in our generation.

0:04:50.540,0:04:53.060
Things perish.

0:04:53.060,0:04:57.440
You cannot see satan in the natural.

0:04:57.440,0:05:08.820
I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - spirit world.

0:05:08.820,0:05:17.600
This is why there is no vision - perish, destruction, killing.

0:05:17.600,0:05:18.820
Tell your neighbour:

0:05:18.820,0:05:33.920
I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - the spirit world.

0:05:33.920,0:05:39.700
That is why the Bible says where there is no vision, people perish.

0:05:39.700,0:05:43.700
satan ...

0:05:43.700,0:05:44.680
Tell your neighbour:

0:05:44.680,0:05:51.400
Where is no vision - perish.

0:05:51.400,0:05:53.220
What can you see here?

0:05:53.220,0:05:59.620
It is impossible to see what is here with your sight.

0:05:59.620,0:06:09.480
With your sight, it is impossible to see what is here.

0:06:09.480,0:06:18.360
Everyone is exposed to things that are not  consistent with God's Word.

0:06:18.360,0:06:25.760
If these things control your feelings and your feelings control your faith,

0:06:25.760,0:06:32.800
you can be a Christian yet controlled by satan's devices.

0:06:32.800,0:06:39.400
If these things control your feelings and your feelings control your faith,

0:06:39.400,0:06:52.040
you can be a Christian yet controlled by satan's devices.

0:06:52.040,0:06:53.320
Tell your neighbour:

0:06:53.320,0:07:06.000
I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - the spirit world.

0:07:06.000,0:07:07.480
Tell your neighbour again.

0:07:07.480,0:07:13.200
I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - spirit world.

0:07:13.200,0:07:23.960
I am more comfortable walking in the Spirit because that is where I can hear Jesus.

0:07:23.960,0:07:24.840
Tell your neighbour:

0:07:24.840,0:07:45.720
I am more comfortable walking in the Spirit because that is where I can hear Jesus.

0:07:45.720,0:07:48.900
- "T.B. Joshua!"
- "Yes, sir."

0:07:48.900,0:07:50.860
In the spirit.

0:07:50.860,0:07:54.320
But in the natural...

0:07:54.320,0:07:57.000
Can you see the life you live today?

0:07:57.000,0:08:05.300
I am more comfortable walking in the Spirit. That is where I can hear Jesus.

0:08:05.300,0:08:13.600
God gives us His Spirit to apprehend Him.

0:08:13.600,0:08:18.660
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:08:18.660,0:08:22.300
Don't forget.

0:08:22.300,0:08:29.220
There has been a great mix-up in the Church.

0:08:29.220,0:08:41.880
It is the erroneous assumption that spiritual truths can be intellectually perceived.

0:08:41.880,0:08:48.920
It is possible to grow up in the Church as a baby -

0:08:48.920,0:08:55.180
your father is founder of this, founder of that church -

0:08:55.180,0:09:12.920
and learn all rites but not know Jesus because Jesus is not known by those external things.

0:09:12.920,0:09:20.620
Jesus is not known by those external things.

0:09:20.620,0:09:44.400
In John 16, it is perfectly plain that the Holy Spirit is the One that reveals Jesus to us.

0:09:44.400,0:09:52.480
You can read your New Testament and still never find Jesus in it.

0:09:52.480,0:10:03.340
You can be convinced that Jesus is the Son of God and still never find Jesus.

0:10:03.340,0:10:11.140
You can be a publisher of the Bible.

0:10:11.140,0:10:16.900
You can know about Christ dying for you.

0:10:16.900,0:10:24.660
You can head this or that religious organisation.

0:10:24.660,0:10:29.000
You can be the Founder and General Overseer

0:10:29.000,0:10:35.900
and still never know Jesus of Nazareth in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:10:35.900,0:10:41.140
In the Church, there are two Christs.

0:10:41.140,0:10:44.460
You need to know the one you are worshipping today.

0:10:44.460,0:10:47.700
There are two Christs:

0:10:47.700,0:10:59.060
1. The Christ of story and of history and song - the baby Jesus.

0:10:59.060,0:11:06.700
2. Then, there is this Christ which the Holy Spirit reveals.

0:11:06.700,0:11:17.100
Many people know about Christ but they don't know Christ.

0:11:17.100,0:11:26.780
There is a difference - knowing about Christ and knowing Christ.

0:11:26.780,0:11:47.420
John 3:27 - 'No man can receive except it is given from above'.

0:11:47.420,0:12:04.380
2 Timothy 3:16 - 'All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable'.

0:12:04.380,0:12:16.500
If you are reasoned into Christianity, some wise fellow can reason you out of it

0:12:16.500,0:12:19.340
unless you know the Holy Spirit.

0:12:19.340,0:12:24.920
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:12:24.920,0:12:31.520
If you are reasoned into Christianity without knowing the Holy Ghost -

0:12:31.520,0:12:35.920
and you become a Christian, claim you are a Christian without the Holy Ghost -

0:12:35.920,0:12:46.680
some wise fellow can reason you out of it - unless you know the Holy Spirit.

0:12:46.680,0:12:53.060
Knowing Jesus is knowing the Holy Ghost.

0:12:53.060,0:12:56.620
This is why you see people today, "I'm a member of this church" -

0:12:56.620,0:12:59.720
"Today, I don't want to go to church again".

0:12:59.720,0:13:02.500
"I used to be a Christian but no..."

0:13:02.500,0:13:05.860
"I'm this" - "No!"

0:13:05.860,0:13:07.680
"I'm a pastor" - "No, I'm no more"

0:13:07.680,0:13:11.060
"I'm an evangelist" - "No, I'm no more an evangelist"

0:13:11.060,0:13:17.760
Some wise fellow can reason you out if you are reasoned into Christianity.

0:13:17.760,0:13:26.080
Why? Because Christianity falls or stands on Christ Jesus,

0:13:26.080,0:13:34.840
stands or falls on the illumination of the Holy Ghost.

0:13:34.840,0:13:44.840
It is either the Holy Spirit or darkness.

0:13:44.840,0:13:50.940
It is either the Holy Ghost or darkness.

0:13:50.940,0:14:01.700
The Holy Ghost is God's imperative of life.

0:14:01.700,0:14:11.580
If our faith is to be a New Testament faith, if Jesus Christ is to be the Christ of God

0:14:11.580,0:14:21.580
rather than the Christ of history or story, the illumination of the Holy Ghost will tell our heart

0:14:21.580,0:14:31.860
that we are learning at Jesus' feet, not at man's feet.

0:14:31.860,0:14:33.080
Are you...

0:14:33.080,0:14:39.680
No, what I'm saying does not demand for applause.

0:14:39.680,0:14:42.340
It demands for crying.

0:14:42.340,0:14:49.120
Sober reflection because I don't see Christians among you.

0:14:49.120,0:14:52.400
I'm seeing religious people sitting down.

0:14:52.400,0:14:54.760
So why are you clapping?

0:14:54.760,0:14:57.000
I cannot see Christians among you.

0:14:57.000,0:14:59.640
I'm seeing religious people sitting down.

0:14:59.640,0:15:04.240
As it should be - the way your forefathers were having God,

0:15:04.240,0:15:07.320
the way your father is praying and fasting,

0:15:07.320,0:15:11.960
that is the way you are going about serving God.

0:15:11.960,0:15:19.200
The Christ of history, story, song - baby Jesus.

0:15:19.200,0:15:24.320
Who is a Christian among us?

0:15:24.320,0:15:27.580
If you are a Christian, can you tell me who is talking to you?

0:15:27.580,0:15:30.880
Are you seeing beyond me? - That is what you call Christian.

0:15:30.880,0:15:34.640
If you are a Christian, you live by the Holy Ghost; you would be able to see beyond me.

0:15:34.640,0:15:37.100
You can't see beyond me; you only see me talking to you.

0:15:37.100,0:15:38.780
That is all you see.

0:15:38.780,0:15:42.340
That is why you can go out when you decide to; you can do anything.

0:15:42.340,0:15:48.500
That is why tomorrow you may not come to church if you are not healed or blessed

0:15:48.500,0:15:54.140
because you are reasoned into Christianity.

0:15:54.140,0:15:57.920
If today is your last day, where are you going?

0:15:57.920,0:16:01.660
Is there any kingdom for religious (people)?

0:16:01.660,0:16:04.980
Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done.

0:16:04.980,0:16:07.200
Where are you going if today is your last day?

0:16:07.200,0:16:11.680
You will tell Jesus, "Im a member of this church; I go to church" -

0:16:11.680,0:16:14.960
is that the excuse you want to give?

0:16:14.960,0:16:24.000
I can't see Christians among you.

0:16:24.000,0:16:25.760
We continue the journey.

0:16:25.760,0:16:28.140
This is the message God asked me to give you.

0:16:28.140,0:16:32.820
KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:16:32.820,0:16:34.400
Thank you.

0:16:34.400,0:16:40.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:40.340,0:16:47.860
If you are not filled with the Spirit, you cannot obey the written Word.

0:16:47.860,0:16:50.460
That is the painful part.

0:16:50.460,0:16:55.940
You are just carrying the Bible and you are  just reading the history part of it

0:16:55.940,0:17:01.960
because there is no way you can obey the Word of God if you are not filled.

0:17:01.960,0:17:04.380
That is the most painful part of it.

0:17:04.380,0:17:06.080
Where is your Bible?

0:17:06.080,0:17:08.580
See. This one - you cannot obey it.

0:17:08.580,0:17:11.000
You will just be reading it as a religious man.

0:17:11.000,0:17:16.600
You read to preach, teach it but to live it - it is not possible.

0:17:16.600,0:17:23.500
If you cannot obey the Scripture, you quench God.

0:17:23.500,0:17:27.120
You quench Him.

0:17:27.120,0:17:30.300
That is the most painful part.

0:17:30.300,0:17:33.900
Reading the Bible, carrying the Bible...

0:17:33.900,0:17:45.960
The Word here is not just history; the Holy Spirit carried the writers along.

0:17:45.960,0:17:50.300
That is the most painful thing - very, very painful.

0:17:50.300,0:17:53.560
Many of you have read this Bible four to five times.

0:17:53.560,0:17:57.660
We have many publishers here - publishers of the Bible.

0:17:57.660,0:18:04.740
They are among you that publish the Bible for daily bread.

0:18:04.740,0:18:07.220
Where are we going?

0:18:07.220,0:18:11.080
That is the most painful part of it.

0:18:11.080,0:18:18.080
The most painful part of it - I mean the Bible is irrelevant to you.

0:18:18.080,0:18:22.480
I will be stretching my hand now; you will see people shaking

0:18:22.480,0:18:24.240
but you don't know what is shaking them.

0:18:24.240,0:18:29.300
The resurrection power that flows within me to them -

0:18:29.300,0:18:32.980
you cannot see it but you always see people shaking and falling.

0:18:32.980,0:18:35.800
It becomes a magic to you.

0:18:35.800,0:18:39.340
"Ah! What is this? Without touching, what is making people to fall?"

0:18:39.340,0:18:41.880
You can't see because you are not filled.

0:18:41.880,0:18:45.980
Through that, it is blaspheming.

0:18:45.980,0:18:50.060
You will not say it out but your heart is saying a lot.

0:18:50.060,0:18:54.140
Your heart is saying a lot; your heart is blaspheming.

0:18:54.140,0:18:57.080
Your heart is not at rest.

0:18:57.080,0:19:01.880
You keep blaspheming; you keep seeing what you do not understand.

0:19:01.880,0:19:04.800
Your heart will blaspheme.

0:19:04.800,0:19:09.320
This is the problem we find ourselves in.

0:19:09.320,0:19:12.140
I will stand here to tell you, "Don't go to that church".

0:19:12.140,0:19:14.580
Why should I say that you should not go there?

0:19:14.580,0:19:17.960
If you go there, you will be able to see more.

0:19:17.960,0:19:21.700
Seeing more will help your history.

0:19:21.700,0:19:25.080
It will make you adequate in serving God.

0:19:25.080,0:19:29.540
If that church is not good, go there. See for yourself.

0:19:29.540,0:19:37.920
If you have not seen enough darkness, you cannot appreciate light.

0:19:37.920,0:19:39.500
That is it.

0:19:39.500,0:19:42.720
Please.

0:19:42.720,0:19:46.600
You are not serving God without the Holy Spirit.

0:19:46.600,0:19:51.120
If you are serving God without the Holy Spirit, you are serving a god you do not know.

0:19:51.120,0:19:52.140
Tell your neighbour:

0:19:52.140,0:20:02.260
If I serve God without the Holy Ghost, I am serving a god I do not know.

0:20:02.260,0:20:07.800
It is the Spirit that makes us know Him.

0:20:07.800,0:20:13.080
Serving God without the Holy Spirit is serving a god you do not know.

0:20:13.080,0:20:19.660
This is the god our forefathers served and this is the life you are living today.

0:20:19.660,0:20:22.340
Someone keeps telling you what God says.

0:20:22.340,0:20:25.200
Someone keeps telling you, "God says you should sleep".

0:20:25.200,0:20:29.000
That is the life you want to live throughout.

0:20:29.000,0:20:30.640
"God says you should sleep."

0:20:30.640,0:20:32.340
"God says you should wake up."

0:20:32.340,0:20:35.100
"God says you should fast."

0:20:35.100,0:20:39.080
"God says you should do this; God says you should go to London."

0:20:39.080,0:20:40.960
Is that the life you want to live throughout?

0:20:40.960,0:20:42.960
It means you are still serving a god you do not know.

0:20:42.960,0:20:45.040
Someone is telling you what God says.

0:20:45.040,0:20:49.400
It means you do not know that god; that is why someone is telling you.

0:20:49.400,0:20:52.040
For how long?

0:20:52.040,0:20:53.480
Very, very painful.

0:20:53.480,0:20:57.320
Tell your neighbour, "Very, very painful".

0:20:57.320,0:21:00.760
Very, very painful.

0:21:00.760,0:21:03.380
That is the way I see it.

0:21:03.380,0:21:07.920
Very, very ... painful.

0:21:07.920,0:21:13.720
Intellectually perceived.

0:21:13.720,0:21:20.760
Spiritual truth - we can intellectually perceive it.

0:21:20.760,0:21:24.860
Very, very painful - you have to get out of this.

0:21:24.860,0:21:26.860
Forget about your problem.

0:21:26.860,0:21:30.020
You don't have a problem; that is the only problem you have.

0:21:30.020,0:21:31.980
Every other problem is not a problem.

0:21:31.980,0:21:37.260
The greatest problem is for you to serve a god you do not know.

0:21:37.260,0:21:38.240
Tell your neighbour:

0:21:38.240,0:21:44.560
The greatest problem - all other are not problems.

0:21:44.560,0:21:54.640
The greatest problem is to serve a god you do not know.

0:21:54.640,0:21:57.980
Imagine your age today - how old are you?

0:21:57.980,0:22:00.120
You have been serving God...

0:22:00.120,0:22:04.260
You have a dream - you have to consult somebody to tell you the meaning.

0:22:04.260,0:22:07.680
You have a job - you want to know whether it is a good job.

0:22:07.680,0:22:14.800
You want to marry - you carry it medically to know whether it is good;

0:22:14.800,0:22:19.140
spiritually, you run from one place to another to know whether it is the right thing.

0:22:19.140,0:22:21.940
This is the life you have been living.

0:22:21.940,0:22:25.920
And such life is not profitable.

0:22:25.920,0:22:30.720
A man cannot receive except it is given from above.

0:22:30.720,0:22:39.300
But you keep receiving from people.

0:22:39.300,0:22:41.840
Where are we going?

0:22:41.840,0:22:47.240
You say you are poor; you are not poor.

0:22:47.240,0:22:51.460
You say you are sick; you are not sick.

0:22:51.460,0:22:55.860
You are only serving a god you do not know.

0:22:55.860,0:22:59.860
If you are blessed today and you still continue serving a god you do not know,

0:22:59.860,0:23:06.400
you will still come back poorer - unless you serve God you know.
