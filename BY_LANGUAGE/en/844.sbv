Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
And Prophecy In Jesus' Name

0:00:01.000,0:00:06.140
Can I talk to you?
How are you?

0:00:06.140,0:00:08.360
Pray against depression.

0:00:08.360,0:00:09.760
Yes.

0:00:09.760,0:00:12.440
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

0:00:12.440,0:00:15.620
Depression is in the family.

0:00:15.620,0:00:16.300
Yes.

0:00:16.300,0:00:20.140
This is suicide in the family - it's a suicide problem.

0:00:20.140,0:00:22.300
But the Lord loves you. Okay?

0:00:22.300,0:00:23.220
Okay, thank you.

0:00:23.220,0:00:26.140
For you to come before Christ - Jesus loves you.

0:00:26.140,0:00:27.680
Thank you.

0:00:27.680,0:00:32.260
You are depressed and many things are going on in your heart.

0:00:32.260,0:00:33.020
Okay.

0:00:33.020,0:00:34.840
This is from your father's side.

0:00:34.840,0:00:36.460
- From my father's side?
- Yes.

0:00:36.460,0:00:38.660
Because my father always tells me that I'm crazy.

0:00:38.660,0:00:42.640
My father is actually a minister, like a pastor, but he is retired.

0:00:42.640,0:00:47.700
He doesn't believe in hell, so he lives in sin.
It's really difficult.

0:00:47.700,0:00:50.220
So, don't worry. Jesus loves you.

0:00:50.220,0:00:51.280
Thank you.

0:00:51.280,0:01:00.420
This is a blessing of God for you today, to tell you that there is a challenge, a court case.

0:01:00.420,0:01:01.640
Thank you.

0:01:01.640,0:01:02.920
Thank You, Lord.

0:01:02.920,0:01:04.660
Come on! Stand up!

0:01:04.660,0:01:07.540
Come here!

0:01:07.540,0:01:09.960
In the name of Jesus!

0:02:12.980,0:02:17.580
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:17.580,0:02:20.520
My name is Heide Menzel. I come from Germany.

0:02:20.520,0:02:25.620
T.B. Joshua told me that I have a spirit of depression, a spirit of suicide,

0:02:25.620,0:02:31.400
and that there is a controversy about a child from my father's side.

0:02:31.400,0:02:32.900
I was very amazed.

0:02:32.900,0:02:36.780
This is the answer I had been longing for for a very long time.

0:02:36.780,0:02:40.460
When I look back, I can see that it affected my whole life

0:02:40.460,0:02:43.340
since I was a small kid, actually since I was born.

0:02:43.340,0:02:45.040
I had flashbacks from the time I was a baby.

0:02:45.040,0:02:48.380
I felt rejected and stopped crying.

0:02:48.380,0:02:57.600
When I grew older, at the age of 6 or 7, I asked God why I'm alive

0:02:57.600,0:03:01.220
when nobody likes me anyway, and I tried to kill myself.

0:03:01.220,0:03:05.380
But I don't know - by the grace of God, I always believed in Him

0:03:05.380,0:03:07.220
and always believed in hell.

0:03:07.220,0:03:13.140
The knowledge that Heaven and hell are real saved my life.

0:03:13.140,0:03:17.820
So you mean from a very small age, this spirit of suicide entered you

0:03:17.820,0:03:21.400
and you heard voices telling you to end your life. Is that right?

0:03:21.400,0:03:22.840
Yes.

0:03:22.840,0:03:27.080
Can you explain, as you grew up, how these voices tormented you

0:03:27.080,0:03:31.500
and how many times that thought of ending your life actually came to you.

0:03:31.500,0:03:36.740
Actually, I totally focused on the future. I was not living at the present anymore.

0:03:36.740,0:03:43.020
Many times I thought about taking my life.

0:03:43.020,0:03:47.340
I had nightmares every night -

0:03:47.340,0:03:50.540
nightmares about someone trying to kill me.

0:03:50.540,0:03:52.780
This affected my whole life.

0:03:52.780,0:03:55.240
My whole life I felt rejected.

0:03:55.240,0:04:01.220
I felt that I was imprisoned in myself; I didn't feel comfortable.

0:04:01.220,0:04:04.300
I didn't like my body and my character.

0:04:04.300,0:04:07.560
My whole life I actually thought something was wrong with me,

0:04:07.560,0:04:09.600
and I just didn't know what it was.

0:04:09.600,0:04:14.820
The problem was: I tried to get close to Jesus but there was a barrier.

0:04:14.820,0:04:17.300
I couldn't reach a certain kind of point.

0:04:17.300,0:04:21.300
So I became very religious, I focused on the Old Testament,

0:04:21.300,0:04:24.400
I did a lot of fasting like the Easter fasting.

0:04:24.400,0:04:31.980
I tried to manipulate Jesus and God whilst I was fasting.

0:04:31.980,0:04:36.500
I went so far that I even quit my job - I was a senior plant buyer -

0:04:36.500,0:04:39.980
to give everything away. I had a very fancy apartment.

0:04:39.980,0:04:42.980
So as to force Jesus to answer me.

0:04:42.980,0:04:45.900
I had only my car left, slept inside the car

0:04:45.900,0:04:48.940
and said, "Lord, here I am. Now, please answer me"

0:04:48.940,0:04:53.840
because I knew there is no other way than Jesus; there is no alternative.

0:04:53.840,0:05:01.940
But there was a barrier I couldn't get past.

0:05:01.940,0:05:06.940
It was very bad. In my heart I knew I needed deliverance

0:05:06.940,0:05:11.900
so I started doing self-deliverance.

0:05:11.900,0:05:16.880
I started to search on YouTube and I also found Emmanuel TV.

0:05:16.880,0:05:21.420
What happened when you started watching Emmanuel TV on YouTube?

0:05:21.420,0:05:23.600
It was actually about a year ago.

0:05:23.600,0:05:26.720
I was amazed; I couldn't stop watching it.

0:05:26.720,0:05:32.020
All those people I saw there had the same problem I had.

0:05:32.020,0:05:35.380
They got somehow stuck; they didn't know where the barrier was.

0:05:35.380,0:05:41.080
In fact, I wasn't even aware that I had this spirit of suicide and depression

0:05:41.080,0:05:48.120
because I numbed my feelings; I was so used to being like this -

0:05:48.120,0:05:54.460
in this kind of unhappy lifestyle - that I didn't even think about it.

0:05:54.460,0:05:57.480
Since that time, I had this huge urge inside of me:

0:05:57.480,0:05:59.580
I had to come here somehow.

0:05:59.580,0:06:06.900
I started to pray along with T.B. Joshua - the prayers for the viewers.

0:06:06.900,0:06:08.600
That's when I came here.

0:06:08.600,0:06:10.940
So can you tell us - when you finally came here,

0:06:10.940,0:06:16.260
and Prophet T.B. Joshua gave you that word of prophecy and you were delivered in Jesus' name,

0:06:16.260,0:06:22.540
what did you experience when you received that touch and that prophecy?

0:06:22.540,0:06:25.940
It was a miracle for me because before, I was at a stage

0:06:25.940,0:06:33.380
where just like Luke 16, Lazarus, I said, "God, I don't know what to do anymore.

0:06:33.380,0:06:35.800
I just endure; I want to overcome.

0:06:35.800,0:06:38.740
I need help; I don't understand what is going on.

0:06:38.740,0:06:42.440
I can't get out of it myself.

0:06:42.440,0:06:46.980
When T.B. Joshua told me this prophecy, it was a big relief.

0:06:46.980,0:06:50.760
A lot of prayers got answered.

0:06:50.760,0:06:55.140
I was so thankful - I am so thankful.

0:06:55.140,0:06:56.320
Thank you.

0:06:56.320,0:06:58.980
So after the prophecy and the deliverance, can you tell us -

0:06:58.980,0:07:03.700
what are the changes that you have seen in your life and your thoughts?

0:07:03.700,0:07:08.040
Actually, before I came here, I was always tired.

0:07:08.040,0:07:12.260
Last year, I experienced a very high tension; I couldn't calm down anymore.

0:07:12.260,0:07:15.360
I was very anxious and stressed.

0:07:15.360,0:07:21.440
Since that deliverance, I have been calm - for the first time in years.

0:07:21.440,0:07:23.820
I was addicted to coffee.

0:07:23.820,0:07:26.240
I stopped drinking coffee in the morning.

0:07:26.240,0:07:29.860
I got up at 2 am for prayers.

0:07:29.860,0:07:33.740
The barrier that was between me and Jesus is gone.

0:07:33.740,0:07:38.940
Now, I can rebuild a completely new relationship to God.

0:07:38.940,0:07:44.040
The things that were hindering me, to come close to God...

0:07:44.040,0:07:49.260
I'm so thankful for that; I'm so grateful. Thank you.

0:07:49.260,0:07:55.600
Hallelujah! Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:07:55.600,0:07:58.340
You mentioned that before: Because of this spirit of suicide,

0:07:58.340,0:08:03.440
every night you would experience nightmares or people were trying to kill you in your dreams.

0:08:03.440,0:08:07.200
Ever since your deliverance, how have you been sleeping?

0:08:07.200,0:08:09.480
It's fine; it's perfect.

0:08:09.480,0:08:11.580
I feel calm.

0:08:11.580,0:08:17.360
I have a joy I had only very few times in my life when I was at church.

0:08:17.360,0:08:20.660
Here, it feels like coming home.

0:08:20.660,0:08:25.540
It's spirit-filled. I want to kiss the whole world.

0:08:25.540,0:08:30.220
I want to thank everyone; I'm so full of love.

0:08:30.220,0:08:32.360
It is just amazing.

0:08:32.360,0:08:34.520
I'm so happy; I'm very happy.

0:08:34.520,0:08:41.560
Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:08:41.560,0:08:45.720
So, madam, after God has delivered you from that spirit of suicide and depression,

0:08:45.720,0:08:48.300
and brought that joy back into your life,

0:08:48.300,0:08:52.480
millions around the world that are suffering from the same problem want to learn from you.

0:08:52.480,0:08:55.500
What would your advice be?

0:08:55.500,0:09:01.500
Please endure because Jesus, by His grace, saved me from being dead for a long time

0:09:01.500,0:09:03.780
just because I knew there was hell.

0:09:03.780,0:09:06.340
Don't end your life because there is someone:

0:09:06.340,0:09:10.600
There is Jesus who loves you more than you could ever imagine.

0:09:10.600,0:09:12.720
I also love you. Don't do it.

0:09:12.720,0:09:17.980
Don't kill yourself because satan hates you and if you kill yourself, you go to hell.

0:09:17.980,0:09:21.320
And hell is the worst place you could ever imagine.

0:09:21.320,0:09:24.800
I believe your situation is very bad right now.

0:09:24.800,0:09:27.700
Very bad - probably worse than mine.

0:09:27.700,0:09:33.380
But believe me, if you go to hell, it will be a thousand times worse, and it is not worth it.

0:09:33.380,0:09:36.720
If you need help, come to this place and get delivered.

0:09:36.720,0:09:39.620
I wasn't even aware that I had that spirit of suicide.

0:09:39.620,0:09:42.500
It was a big relief to find out.

0:09:42.500,0:09:46.820
It was actually obvious but I didn't think about it.

0:09:46.820,0:09:54.380
So please, I'm begging you, make God your protection.

0:09:54.380,0:09:57.540
I can tell because I used to be a backpacker.

0:09:57.540,0:10:00.720
He protected me at least twice from being raped.

0:10:00.720,0:10:04.120
When you have God as your protection, He guides you.

0:10:04.120,0:10:08.640
My prayer for you is what I prayed when I was facing hard times:

0:10:08.640,0:10:13.720
God, if I ever leave you, please take me by the hand and bring me back.

0:10:13.720,0:10:18.580
This is my prayer for you that God holds your hand

0:10:18.580,0:10:22.340
and brings you to a place where you can get delivered and find peace.

0:10:22.340,0:10:27.120
And you have to know that the spirit of suicide, when you want to kill yourself,

0:10:27.120,0:10:31.840
is a spirit which hates you and you can get rid of it.

0:10:31.840,0:10:36.040
Please, don't waste your life

0:10:36.040,0:10:39.580
and come to a place like this where it is like Heaven on earth.

0:10:39.580,0:10:42.420
Please...

0:10:42.420,0:10:43.360
Amen.

0:10:45.460,0:10:48.440
So we have heard from our sister. That is a wonderful advice,

0:10:48.440,0:10:51.260
telling everyone that has that thought of trying to kill oneself

0:10:51.260,0:10:54.960
that there is a spirit behind it - a spirit of suicide.

0:10:54.960,0:10:59.920
They should be open for deliverance and remember, God loves them.

0:10:59.920,0:11:05.460
And we should never doubt God's ability or desire to rescue us from every situation.

0:11:05.460,0:11:11.120
Our problem, whatever it may be, does not embarrass Jesus Christ because He has a solution.

0:11:11.120,0:11:13.560
We thank God for your life and your deliverance.

0:11:13.560,0:11:18.240
We want to encourage you: Now that you have received this wonderful deliverance in Christ,

0:11:18.240,0:11:20.560
you should be ruled by the Word of God

0:11:20.560,0:11:24.240
so that you continue to maintain this wonderful joy, in Jesus' name.

0:11:24.240,0:11:25.400
Thank you, everybody!
