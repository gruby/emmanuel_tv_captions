0:00:00.000,0:00:04.400
There's a lady there. Your mother discovered you in the church today

0:00:04.400,0:00:07.360
You abandoned your country - from Cameroon

0:00:07.360,0:00:09.520
Jesus loves you; let them come out.

0:00:13.140,0:00:17.640
The lady whom the prophecy concerned that had abandoned her country and family

0:00:17.640,0:00:18.960
walks forward.

0:00:18.960,0:00:20.200
You are the lost one?

0:00:20.200,0:00:21.260
Yes, man of God.

0:00:21.260,0:00:22.960
And your mother found you?

0:00:22.960,0:00:24.020
Yes!

0:00:24.020,0:00:29.080
Man of God, for more than three years, my mother has not seen her;

0:00:29.080,0:00:31.020
we have not seen her; it is here!

0:00:31.020,0:00:34.700
My dad just met her in front of the church like that stranded

0:00:34.700,0:00:38.200
as if she did not even know where she was going to.

0:00:38.200,0:00:40.300
We've been looking for her, man of God.

0:00:40.300,0:00:42.040
Where is your friend?

0:00:42.040,0:00:43.780
Go and bring your friend.

0:00:43.780,0:00:45.560
Follow her.

0:00:48.460,0:00:52.260
After being divinely located through the message of prophecy,

0:00:52.260,0:00:58.000
this young lady walks into the crowd to bring her friend who is also mentioned by the man of God

0:00:59.000,0:01:04.120
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:04.120,0:01:06.520
My name is Nkamanyi Kelly.

0:01:06.520,0:01:08.900
I am a Cameroonian.

0:01:08.900,0:01:15.120
I was in church on last week Sunday when the prophecy of the man of God came out.

0:01:15.120,0:01:20.500
And it was all about me; it was 100% true.

0:01:20.500,0:01:23.920
So when I walked out, the man of God said so you are the lost and found?

0:01:23.920,0:01:25.920
I said, "Yes, man of God, I am".

0:01:25.920,0:01:30.640
Because for three years, my family has not seen me; they don't know my whereabouts.

0:01:30.640,0:01:33.880
So, they were so surprised on Sunday.

0:01:33.880,0:01:36.340
We all met in the church.

0:01:36.340,0:01:41.780
But, how this thing started before I started leaving house and walking away from my family.

0:01:41.780,0:01:49.100
Okay, before you continue with your story. Can you introduce those who are standing with you.

0:01:49.100,0:01:52.660
The person next to me is my elder sister.

0:01:52.660,0:01:55.500
Then, my dad.

0:01:55.500,0:01:57.560
Then, my mum.

0:01:57.560,0:02:01.380
Then, that is the family of my friend, as you can see in the prophecy

0:02:01.380,0:02:03.380
where the man of God asked me, "Where is your friend?"

0:02:03.380,0:02:05.040
I walked out with her.

0:02:05.040,0:02:10.340
That's my friend there, second to the last, close to her mum.

0:02:10.340,0:02:11.080
Yes.

0:02:11.080,0:02:13.040
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:02:13.040,0:02:17.880
Okay. You received the prophecy last Sunday from the man of God.

0:02:17.880,0:02:24.140
Can you now tell us your experience before you came to The SCOAN.

0:02:24.140,0:02:28.980
My experience how I started going out of the house: I was at the age of 15.

0:02:28.980,0:02:34.300
Then my dad was not around; he was in the United States.

0:02:34.300,0:02:38.880
He was not around for almost seven to eight years. He was in the United States.

0:02:38.880,0:02:42.020
So, I was with my mum and sister in the house.

0:02:42.020,0:02:46.240
At that age of 15, I was leaving the house, running away from the house,

0:02:46.240,0:02:50.380
just following friends, going around.

0:02:50.380,0:02:55.680
Sometimes, I would just leave the house for two to three months at that tender age.

0:02:55.680,0:02:57.640
Nobody would even know my whereabouts.

0:02:57.640,0:03:00.440
Sometimes for two to three months, my mum would not even see me, nor my sister.

0:03:00.440,0:03:04.840
Then, my sister was in school; she was still in the university back then.

0:03:04.840,0:03:10.900
The only time my mum would set her eyes on me was after two to three months.

0:03:10.900,0:03:14.400
Then, I had not left Cameroon yet at that age of 15.

0:03:14.400,0:03:18.820
Sometimes, I would be passing in front of the house and I would be on top of a bike.

0:03:18.820,0:03:22.280
Before my mum would even set her eyes on me, "Is that not Kelly passing?",

0:03:22.280,0:03:26.640
I would just wave my hand and do like this, and tell the bike man, "Fire; move!"

0:03:26.640,0:03:29.340
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:03:29.340,0:03:34.080
So they would think you are coming from somewhere, not knowing you are living somewhere very close?

0:03:34.080,0:03:36.060
Yes, they always thought I am coming from somewhere.

0:03:36.060,0:03:40.900
I may leave the house and am directly opposite the house for two to three months with friends.

0:03:40.900,0:03:42.400
So, they only saw you on the bike?

0:03:42.400,0:03:43.760
They would only see me on the bike.

0:03:43.760,0:03:45.740
When I was passing, I would tell the bike man, "Fire!"

0:03:45.740,0:03:48.720
The bike man would not understand that am passing in front of my house.

0:03:48.720,0:03:51.060
Before my mum would ask, "Is that not my daughter?",

0:03:51.060,0:03:54.740
I would just wave to her and do like this, and she would start crying.

0:03:54.740,0:03:56.600
And that was at what age?

0:03:56.600,0:04:00.240
That was at the age of 15 when I started leaving the house.

0:04:00.240,0:04:04.640
It was like a spirit that always came over me, "Go away, go away!"

0:04:04.640,0:04:09.340
Just following friends around at the age of 15.

0:04:09.340,0:04:14.780
So during that period, just like that, I started going out; before I then followed some friends.

0:04:14.780,0:04:18.360
Sometimes, they would take me; we would travel out of town.

0:04:18.360,0:04:23.100
At that age as I was moving around, I got pregnant

0:04:23.100,0:04:25.120
So when I got pregnant,

0:04:25.120,0:04:29.380
at that tender age, I didn't even know when I got pregnant.

0:04:29.380,0:04:34.500
When I realised it, it had gone too far like one to three months.

0:04:34.500,0:04:36.500
Yes, we were all there.

0:04:36.500,0:04:39.060
So the pregnancy was like six months.

0:04:39.060,0:04:44.680
When things were rough for me and I could not bear it anymore, I had to run back home.

0:04:44.680,0:04:47.040
When I run back home and my family then saw me -

0:04:47.040,0:04:50.480
that is my mum because my dad was in the United States -

0:04:50.480,0:04:53.300
the pregnancy had already reached six months.

0:04:53.300,0:04:57.640
Because of that, they couldn't do anything; they just had to welcome me back home.

0:04:57.640,0:04:59.740
And I stayed home until I gave birth

0:04:59.740,0:05:04.720
and when I gave birth to my baby, at the age of 3 to 4 months,

0:05:04.720,0:05:08.480
it was always disturbing me and I moved out again.

0:05:08.480,0:05:11.820
I left him at that age and went out again.

0:05:11.820,0:05:15.940
I was just moving with friends again, all around.

0:05:15.940,0:05:19.940
So the baby you gave birth to, you left the baby with whom?

0:05:19.940,0:05:23.300
With my mum. The baby is in the house. He is a baby boy.

0:05:23.300,0:05:27.580
So, after that I started moving around with friends again.

0:05:27.580,0:05:31.720
I had not started coming to Nigeria back then because I was very young.

0:05:31.720,0:05:36.880
I was just moving with friends. I was just enjoying life, living life on my own.

0:05:36.880,0:05:39.440
Sometimes, we could go to clubs

0:05:39.440,0:05:42.860
because I believe when you go to clubs, you are living life on your own.

0:05:42.860,0:05:48.760
You are not based on one man, you move from one man to another. It is prostitution.

0:05:48.760,0:05:51.680
So I was just living that life, enjoying it.

0:05:51.680,0:05:55.560
So gradually, before I started coming up, I was growing.

0:05:55.560,0:06:00.900
One day, I suddenly followed friends to cross the border, coming to Nigeria.

0:06:00.900,0:06:04.920
And that is where I really started.

0:06:04.920,0:06:09.840
When I came to Nigeria with friends, the friends I followed never told me anything -

0:06:09.840,0:06:11.800
they were not supposed to tell me anything.

0:06:11.800,0:06:14.720
When we got to Nigeria, we landed in Lagos.

0:06:14.720,0:06:17.900
In Nigeria we separated; everybody found their way.

0:06:17.900,0:06:20.900
Then, my family did not know where I was. I didn't call them.

0:06:20.900,0:06:25.380
As I came now to Lagos, I met other friends.

0:06:25.380,0:06:30.140
We started together, going to clubs.

0:06:30.140,0:06:31.720
I was living in a friend's house.

0:06:31.720,0:06:34.520
She is like a friend but she is also a club girl. She has a flat.

0:06:34.520,0:06:40.000
So this was the life I was living, all that while.

0:06:40.000,0:06:43.040
I was not calling my parents. They did not know my whereabout.

0:06:43.040,0:06:50.660
All this while, your parents did not know where you were, in which country you were and what you were doing?

0:06:50.660,0:06:55.020
Yes, they didn't know where I was, and I didn't call them because I always feared

0:06:55.020,0:06:59.140
that anytime I called, they would ask, "Where are you? Why are you out?"

0:06:59.140,0:07:00.900
Sometimes, I was scared of calling them because

0:07:00.900,0:07:03.660
I didn't want them to see the code number, to know where I was.

0:07:03.660,0:07:08.900
I just wanted them to have that belief  that maybe I was around, in Cameroon, patrolling around.

0:07:08.900,0:07:12.500
I never wanted them to have an idea that I stepped out.

0:07:12.500,0:07:17.380
So two years were gone, before turning to three years now.

0:07:17.380,0:07:19.680
This is three years plus now.

0:07:19.680,0:07:23.740
So, it was last month.

0:07:23.740,0:07:27.360
Last month, I don't know what just came over me.

0:07:27.360,0:07:33.360
A spirit came like, "Call your mum, call the people in the house to know how they are doing".

0:07:33.360,0:07:36.600
And I called my mum, and she started crying on the phone,

0:07:36.600,0:07:40.260
"Where are you? Where have you been?" I said, "Don't question me where I have been.

0:07:40.260,0:07:42.220
How are you people doing? I just called to say hi".

0:07:42.220,0:07:45.440
Anytime she wanted to question me too much, I would switch off the phone,

0:07:45.440,0:07:48.940
saying like, "Ah, why is she disturbing my life?"

0:07:48.940,0:07:54.060
After like two, three days again, I would free my mind and call her.

0:07:54.060,0:07:59.080
If she wants to question me much again... and once I finished with that call, I would change that number.

0:07:59.080,0:08:01.200
Immediately, not wasting time.

0:08:01.200,0:08:04.980
Because I didn't want them to reach me because I was thinking I was living a good life.

0:08:04.980,0:08:10.020
I never wanted any distractions that would take me away from it.

0:08:10.020,0:08:14.140
By this time, how many years had you disappeared from home?

0:08:14.140,0:08:15.920
This is four years now.

0:08:15.920,0:08:16.820
Four years?

0:08:16.820,0:08:20.260
Yes, four years! Then suddenly last month, I was just like let me call them.

0:08:20.260,0:08:23.100
You have not seen your parents and your parents have not seen you for four years?

0:08:23.100,0:08:27.480
I have not seen them, they have not seen me. We saw each other now in The SCOAN.

0:08:27.480,0:08:32.020
So now tell us, what now brought you to The SCOAN

0:08:32.020,0:08:40.000
and tell us the circumstances by which your parents now met you in The SCOAN.

0:08:40.000,0:08:43.300
Okay, that was three weeks ago.

0:08:43.300,0:08:50.040
My spirit was just like, "I am not okay. Let me call home. What is going on with me?

0:08:50.040,0:08:52.480
What is really going on with me?"

0:08:52.480,0:08:58.560
Not even knowing that my dad has been in Cameroon, to the extent that he has been to The SCOAN,

0:08:58.560,0:09:01.940
and returned to Cameroon with the Morning Water.

0:09:01.940,0:09:08.720
All their prayers with the Morning Water were all about me and my name.

0:09:08.720,0:09:15.540
So that last month, I was not feeling okay. All that time my body wanted me to like just talk to my family.

0:09:15.540,0:09:18.560
I never knew that it was because of their prayers.

0:09:18.560,0:09:22.980
So when I called home, I called my mum, I was like, "How is everyone?"

0:09:22.980,0:09:25.940
My mum said, "You still call again with a Nigerian number which means you are in Nigeria".

0:09:25.940,0:09:31.280
I said, "Yes, I am in Nigeria". My mum said, "Thank God. Your sister has travelled to Nigeria".

0:09:31.280,0:09:36.300
Which is my elder sister here standing beside me. I asked, "What did she come to do to in Nigeria".

0:09:36.300,0:09:40.800
She said, "She went there to see man of God. Even your dad has been there also".

0:09:40.800,0:09:44.840
I was like, "Ah, are you serious? Okay, please can you send me her number".

0:09:44.840,0:09:47.860
My mum said, "No problem". She will send it to me through text message,

0:09:47.860,0:09:51.540
and that I should make sure wherever my elder sister is, I should make sure I visit her

0:09:51.540,0:09:57.600
because I knew she does not know anywhere in Nigeria and they want me to take her around.

0:09:57.600,0:10:02.340
It was a lie. They never wanted me to take her around. They wanted to trap me here.

0:10:02.340,0:10:05.040
I was like, "No problem.

0:10:05.040,0:10:09.940
Anything she comes to do, if she comes to go to the market, I know the market I will take her around".

0:10:09.940,0:10:15.420
So I didn't know. I called her and she was surprised and I told her, "It's me, Kelly.

0:10:15.420,0:10:22.540
Mum told me you are in Nigeria". She said, "Yes, I am at SCOAN in a nearby hotel. Please can you come?"

0:10:22.540,0:10:27.580
I said, "No problem, I will come". It took me like one to two days thinking, "Synagogue, Synagugue".

0:10:27.580,0:10:31.200
I didn't trust my sister because I do follow Emmanuel TV once in a while.

0:10:31.200,0:10:36.400
I was like, "What if I go to see my sister and it happens that the man of God locates me?

0:10:36.400,0:10:38.860
What will I say?"

0:10:38.860,0:10:40.580
This is what I was thinking.

0:10:40.580,0:10:45.860
So this shows that you were not even prepared to leave that kind of life?

0:10:45.860,0:10:51.040
Yes! I was not even prepared. On my own, it's not easy.

0:10:51.040,0:10:52.980
It's like a spiritual act.

0:10:52.980,0:10:54.980
It's like you don't do it on your own.

0:10:54.980,0:10:58.440
Why I say that is: Now I realise that it was not on my own

0:10:58.440,0:11:04.140
because I am still surprised that it was I that was living that kind of life.

0:11:04.140,0:11:06.580
So, when I came now, my sister...

0:11:06.580,0:11:08.100
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:11:08.100,0:11:09.320
Hallelujah.

0:11:09.320,0:11:13.100
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:11:13.100,0:11:16.280
So when my sister waited one day, two days and she didn't see me,

0:11:16.280,0:11:20.120
she kept on calling, "Where are you? Are you not coming to see me?" I said, "Don't worry, I am coming.

0:11:20.120,0:11:23.020
And when I come, I will even come with fruits for you".

0:11:23.020,0:11:28.520
And I have been in Nigeria for those three, four years but I don't know where The SCOAN is located.

0:11:28.520,0:11:31.240
Because we were very far, right in Lekki.

0:11:31.240,0:11:35.240
So I went to my girlfriend which is this my friend at this end.

0:11:35.240,0:11:40.720
Because for some time, since she gave birth to this baby, she has not been coming out.

0:11:40.720,0:11:43.720
So I went over to visit her and I was like, "My elder sister is here.

0:11:43.720,0:11:46.100
Please, I don't know where The SCOAN is.

0:11:46.100,0:11:49.760
I would like you to take me there as it is my first time", and she said, "Okay, no problem".

0:11:49.760,0:11:53.920
She said, "I don't have money". I said, "Don't worry. If money is the problem, I will pay for your transport

0:11:53.920,0:11:57.480
to and fro. Let me just set eyes on my sister".

0:11:57.480,0:11:59.980
When we came that day, I called my sister that we are on our way.

0:11:59.980,0:12:04.680
She never believed because she expected that I would be the last person any of them would ever see.

0:12:04.680,0:12:06.880
She said, "Are you really sure because I don't trust you?"

0:12:06.880,0:12:09.300
I said, "Don't worry. Just have faith, I am coming".

0:12:09.300,0:12:12.540
That was around Tuesday.

0:12:12.540,0:12:18.600
We came and she directed us and send one of the workers from the hotel to come to the gate to pick us.

0:12:18.600,0:12:21.640
We now went to the hotel, and I met her.

0:12:21.640,0:12:24.900
She ate the fruits I brought for her, and we were all talking and talking.

0:12:24.900,0:12:34.540
She now gave me the Morning Water, the book 'The Mirror' and the Morning Water booklet.

0:12:34.540,0:12:38.120
She then told me to be following up and use the Morning Water.

0:12:38.120,0:12:41.740
Immediately I took that Morning Water and sprayed in my mouth, I said, "Is it right?"

0:12:41.740,0:12:45.700
She said, "Yes, I can spray anywhere I want".

0:12:45.700,0:12:47.340
When we were leaving, she said I should promise her that

0:12:47.340,0:12:49.540
I am coming this Sunday for us to worship together.

0:12:49.540,0:12:53.400
So when you were spraying that Morning Water, what did you expect?

0:12:53.400,0:12:58.340
Since you said that as at this time, your mind was not even there to leave this job.

0:12:58.340,0:12:59.840
So when you were spraying the Morning Water,

0:12:59.840,0:13:03.420
what were you thinking that this Morning Water will do for you?

0:13:03.420,0:13:07.420
My own idea for that Morning Water, to be truthful...

0:13:07.420,0:13:10.720
When I got the Morning Water from her, she never knew my mind.

0:13:10.720,0:13:14.280
She was thinking I was taking it for protection, but my idea with that Morning Water was

0:13:14.280,0:13:17.400
that I wanted to use it for clubbing - for my business.

0:13:17.400,0:13:19.860
Oh, so that you have more business?

0:13:19.860,0:13:21.100
More business!

0:13:21.100,0:13:25.260
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:13:25.260,0:13:28.480
You mistook it for a good luck charm?

0:13:28.480,0:13:31.060
Yes! That I may have more customers.

0:13:31.060,0:13:36.360
I never knew that water was the end of my business in bringing me here.

0:13:36.360,0:13:38.440
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:38.440,0:13:41.780
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:13:41.780,0:13:49.620
The same Morning Water she was praying with, thinking will bring more business

0:13:49.620,0:13:52.780
was the same Morning Water that God used to trap her down

0:13:52.780,0:13:55.900
at the end of the day, until her family found her.

0:13:55.900,0:13:57.580
Tell us how it happened.

0:13:57.580,0:14:00.720
When I took the Morning Water that day, I promised my sister that I would come to church

0:14:00.720,0:14:04.800
on Sunday which was last week's Sunday.

0:14:04.800,0:14:07.540
I went home. She kept on calling again.

0:14:07.540,0:14:11.700
I was following up with the Morning Water booklet until I finished reading it.

0:14:11.700,0:14:13.140
I was reading it.

0:14:13.140,0:14:16.140
I was even surprised that I was the one reading it; my friends were surprised.

0:14:16.140,0:14:18.540
Sometimes, I would read like two to three days.

0:14:18.540,0:14:19.800
I would not go to the club.

0:14:19.800,0:14:23.020
The night before the Sunday I came to The SCOAN,

0:14:23.020,0:14:28.300
that Saturday I was with this my girlfriend, the one close to her mum, second to the last.

0:14:28.300,0:14:31.640
Because she is my very close friend.

0:14:31.640,0:14:34.260
She is my very close friend when it comes to street life.

0:14:34.260,0:14:37.860
She is the person I am very close to because we live the same kind of life.

0:14:37.860,0:14:41.900
Among all my friends, she is the person that understands me and I understand her most.

0:14:41.900,0:14:47.360
That Saturday, I was in her house, in her family house with her.

0:14:47.360,0:14:50.080
But her mum, nobody knew what we were discussing.

0:14:50.080,0:14:53.420
We planned that we were going to VI. We never planned for The SCOAN.

0:14:53.420,0:14:56.480
The SCOAN was the last programme in our world.

0:14:56.480,0:15:01.620
She said she cannot go out from her family house because of her mum that Saturday.

0:15:01.620,0:15:05.020
What she will do is that we will now go together to VI.

0:15:05.020,0:15:08.640
She even took some of her dresses, and we went to prepare that Saturday in my own place

0:15:08.640,0:15:11.480
where we are living in VI to go to the club.

0:15:11.480,0:15:15.600
She arranged her things and everything. We then went to VI, which was last Saturday.

0:15:15.600,0:15:20.340
When we got to VI, we met other friends in the house. They were happy we were around.

0:15:20.340,0:15:23.880
I even brought out my things, around 9:00 o'clock in the night.

0:15:23.880,0:15:29.180
We went to fetch water. That is the water we would use to bath when we get up at around 12:00 o'clock

0:15:29.180,0:15:33.240
in the night to go out because our tap in the house has a little problem.

0:15:33.240,0:15:39.020
We dropped the water, I brought my dresses out, my high shoes and little shorts

0:15:39.020,0:15:43.260
that I wanted to put on because Saturday was the most wonderful day to us.

0:15:43.260,0:15:47.400
When you are living that kind of life you can never miss club

0:15:47.400,0:15:53.140
because Saturday, we see it as a very grateful day when it comes to that business.

0:15:53.140,0:15:57.580
I put on my shorts and I put on my tank top. I arranged it.

0:15:57.580,0:16:00.860
She too arranged her own and everything. I said, "OK, no problem".

0:16:00.860,0:16:03.760
She lied down and the other people asked, "Why is she lying down?"

0:16:03.760,0:16:08.120
I then went to take the Morning Water because I do use it, even when I want to bathe.

0:16:08.120,0:16:11.860
That night, I don't even know what happened. I just sprayed the Morning Water.

0:16:11.860,0:16:18.220
I took it and sprayed two sprays inside my own bucket of water.

0:16:18.220,0:16:20.880
She was already lying down about to sleep.

0:16:20.880,0:16:25.340
So you were thinking with that spray of the Morning Water you would have enough customers?

0:16:25.340,0:16:27.100
Yes, everything will be okay with me in the club.

0:16:27.100,0:16:32.300
I went with that water to the bathroom, bathed with half of that water and reserved half.

0:16:32.300,0:16:37.280
So that in case I wake up around 1 o'clock, I am going to bathe with the remaining half.

0:16:37.280,0:16:41.500
After I finished bathing and dropping two drops of the anointed water,

0:16:41.500,0:16:44.560
I came to the bed and slept like a baby.

0:16:44.560,0:16:48.880
When I slept off - something that has never happened before -, around 12:00 o'clock,

0:16:48.880,0:16:52.960
the other girl, who was also our friend and the owner of the house, was also going out

0:16:52.960,0:16:56.460
dressed up and woke me up, "Wake up! Are you not going out?"

0:16:56.460,0:16:58.200
Because she is not close to my friend.

0:16:58.200,0:17:00.460
"Wake up! What's happening! Are you not going out?

0:17:00.460,0:17:02.060
I have already dressed up. Get up and dress up!"

0:17:02.060,0:17:07.180
I said, "No, no, no! Don't worry. I want to sleep a bit longer".

0:17:07.180,0:17:08.280
She said, "Are you sure?"

0:17:08.280,0:17:12.340
I said, "Yes, don't worry if you are going". I even stood up.

0:17:12.340,0:17:16.260
I was the one who locked the door for her when she went out.

0:17:16.260,0:17:19.580
I fell on the bed and slept off again.

0:17:19.580,0:17:23.540
And by the time we woke up, it was 5:00 o'clock, 4:30 in the morning.

0:17:23.540,0:17:24.340
On Sunday morning?

0:17:24.340,0:17:24.940
Yes!

0:17:24.940,0:17:29.400
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:17:29.400,0:17:31.460
On Sunday morning, which was 4:30 am.

0:17:31.460,0:17:33.880
Immediately I woke up, I slapped my friend,

0:17:33.880,0:17:38.860
"Wake up! What happened? What kind of sleep is this!" She said, "Jesus! What kind of sleep is this?"

0:17:38.860,0:17:41.120
She even shouted, "Jesus! What kind of sleep is this?"

0:17:41.120,0:17:43.780
We were even thinking that it was the other friend that has done something to us

0:17:43.780,0:17:47.880
because we know her as a very bad person when it comes to us.

0:17:47.880,0:17:49.600
We even tried to attack her.

0:17:49.600,0:17:52.080
We were like spoiling her name.

0:17:52.080,0:17:55.520
Did she not do something to us.

0:17:55.520,0:17:57.000
We have never slept like this on a Saturday.

0:17:57.000,0:18:01.740
I was even telling my friend, "Can you imagine. I was the one who stood up and closed the door for Sandra.

0:18:01.740,0:18:03.240
Sandra went out.

0:18:03.240,0:18:06.520
I don't even know how I even came back to the bed and followed you and slept off".

0:18:06.520,0:18:11.580
Before she even slept off, before we left her own house that Saturday and came to this house,

0:18:11.580,0:18:15.140
I went to bathe. I still used that anointed spray inside the water.

0:18:15.140,0:18:22.560
She asked me, as I was having detox, whether I could put the detox into her own water.

0:18:22.560,0:18:27.620
That spray was in my hand but my friend did not know because I went to bathe with it.

0:18:27.620,0:18:30.900
So immediately I was spraying that detox in the house inside my water,

0:18:30.900,0:18:33.020
I sprayed that spray too in her water

0:18:33.020,0:18:36.740
but I didn't tell her. I don't know what was happening to me.

0:18:36.740,0:18:42.360
So I also sprayed in her water. As we then went and slept, that failed to wake us up.

0:18:42.360,0:18:47.000
She then said, "Calliente is okay". Because there is a club called 'Calliente Night Club'.

0:18:47.000,0:18:49.700
It is a morning club. You go there by five o'clock.

0:18:49.700,0:18:51.240
You don't go early.

0:18:51.240,0:18:55.420
She now said, "It's Calliente now". I said, "Yes, Calliente. Time has not gone for Calliente.

0:18:55.420,0:18:57.340
You go and take a quick bath".

0:18:57.340,0:19:01.580
She took her bag and everything. She dressed herself, wore her gown and put make-up.

0:19:01.580,0:19:06.100
I then went to the bathroom and she was waiting for me. We are going to Calliente Night Club.

0:19:06.100,0:19:09.340
I went as the second person to take my bath.

0:19:09.340,0:19:15.520
I still put that Morning Water again in my water.

0:19:15.520,0:19:21.040
Two sprays and I showered. As I was coming out from the bathroom, I just told her, "Do you know something?

0:19:21.040,0:19:24.360
As I am standing here right now, no more Calliente, I want to go to The SCOAN".

0:19:24.360,0:19:31.880
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:19:31.880,0:19:35.100
I said I wanted to go to The SCOAN. She was shocked!

0:19:35.100,0:19:39.000
She was opening her mouth to say, "But Calliente, we used to stay five, six".

0:19:39.000,0:19:42.040
It was like the two were controlling me and controlling her also.

0:19:42.040,0:19:45.260
She never hesitated. She said, "Yes, let's go!"

0:19:45.260,0:19:49.400
Even me, I was shocked when she said, "Yes, let's go!" I said, "Let's dress up".

0:19:49.400,0:19:52.860
Because anybody that saw us that Sunday, the way we were even dressing and our appearance -

0:19:52.860,0:19:56.500
it's not like we were going to church; it was out of confusion.

0:19:56.500,0:19:58.460
If you saw us and the way we were dressing.

0:19:58.460,0:20:03.440
As we dressed up and finished, even one of our friends who did not go out

0:20:03.440,0:20:05.300
was surprised, "What was going on with us?"

0:20:05.300,0:20:08.540
We didn't even tell the one in the house where we were going to.

0:20:08.540,0:20:12.860
We didn't even say good morning to her. She was talking to us. I was just ignoring her.

0:20:12.860,0:20:14.680
My friend asked me, "What happened?"

0:20:14.680,0:20:18.960
I said, "I want to go to church and I don't want any distraction. I want to go to The SCOAN.

0:20:18.960,0:20:20.640
Today is Sunday".

0:20:20.640,0:20:23.220
She was thinking maybe I carried something in my mind.

0:20:23.220,0:20:24.100
Nothing!

0:20:24.100,0:20:25.340
That's how I walked out of the house.

0:20:25.340,0:20:29.080
We entered the bus and the bus stopped at the gate.

0:20:29.080,0:20:32.280
We didn't even know our way in here, we didn't even know where the entrance was.

0:20:32.280,0:20:34.280
When we saw the police and the security,

0:20:34.320,0:20:37.340
I told my friend that there is a part I used to watch on the TV.

0:20:37.340,0:20:41.140
We were just discussing, not knowing that my dad is outside of the church,

0:20:41.140,0:20:45.300
standing in front of the door, watching me coming from a distance.

0:20:45.300,0:20:47.820
But he never wanted to say anything because he knew that

0:20:47.820,0:20:53.420
if I saw him first, I would run back, because I always do that.

0:20:53.420,0:20:56.580
So my dad just kept quiet. I never knew he was standing there.

0:20:56.580,0:20:59.400
I was just telling my friend , "If they don't allow us to go inside,

0:20:59.400,0:21:02.760
do you know what we will do? Let's just go straight. On TV when I watched it,

0:21:02.760,0:21:07.180
I used to see the camera on a canopy where people are sitting.

0:21:07.180,0:21:11.940
But where is that canopy?" So it is the canopy I was looking for. I told her, "There is no canopy here.

0:21:11.940,0:21:13.540
I am confused. What are we going to do?

0:21:13.540,0:21:19.240
Okay, if there is no canopy, I don't know where it is. After church, my sister will see me outside".

0:21:19.240,0:21:23.620
Not even knowing that my mum and dad were already here.

0:21:23.620,0:21:27.140
So as we were just jesting, we were coming to the front of the church.

0:21:27.140,0:21:31.600
Not knowing I was just coming in front of my dad and he was watching me quietly.

0:21:31.600,0:21:33.640
I said, "Let me just look up".

0:21:33.640,0:21:37.320
It was in front of my dad. I said, "Jesus!"

0:21:37.320,0:21:41.680
Ah! I now shouted! To run back, I could not run.

0:21:41.680,0:21:45.160
To move forward, I could not move. I was just pinned where I was.

0:21:45.160,0:21:50.140
I was just confused. Before I knew it, my dad had gone in to call my mum and sister.

0:21:50.140,0:21:54.080
My mum came out and she was crying and and shouting. I hugged her.

0:21:54.080,0:21:56.180
I could not go back when my dad entered the church.

0:21:56.180,0:21:58.180
I didn't even know, I was just tied.

0:21:58.180,0:22:03.420
But if it was before, I swear that moment he left me, I would have taken off.

0:22:03.420,0:22:04.320
You couldn't move?

0:22:04.320,0:22:06.000
I couldn't move, I was just tied.

0:22:06.000,0:22:09.960
My sister was not surprised because I had visited her in the hotel.

0:22:09.960,0:22:14.180
But my mum, she just came out, was crying and everything.

0:22:14.180,0:22:18.120
I don't know how my dad did everything before I came into the church -

0:22:18.120,0:22:20.880
not up to a few minutes before my prophecy came up.

0:22:20.880,0:22:24.160
As if the man of God had been waiting for me all this year.

0:22:24.160,0:22:26.860
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:22:26.860,0:22:33.320
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:22:33.320,0:22:38.040
Since the prophecy last Sunday and your deliverance -

0:22:38.040,0:22:41.860
tell us, what has changed in your life?

0:22:41.860,0:22:47.020
Many things have changed in my life. I can't even believe I am the one standing here.

0:22:47.020,0:22:55.060
God is great because since that Sunday the man of God delivered me, I have not been out.

0:22:55.060,0:22:58.060
He keeps me here under his care in the church.

0:22:58.060,0:23:03.860
I see the difference because before, I was somebody that - even my friend at that end can testify -

0:23:03.860,0:23:07.920
I couldn't do without alcohol. I didn't drink beer but straight whiskey.

0:23:07.920,0:23:13.120
If you mixed my whiskey with coke or fanta, it is like you want to kill me.

0:23:13.120,0:23:15.480
I loved drinking direct whisky.

0:23:15.480,0:23:17.460
I could not stay 24 hours without it.

0:23:17.460,0:23:20.840
Even if I didn't see whiskey, like on a day when I didn't have money to buy it,

0:23:20.840,0:23:24.540
I would buy what Nigerian people call "ogogoro"

0:23:24.540,0:23:28.820
Yes! I would make sure I take something hot which is dry gin.

0:23:28.820,0:23:34.920
But since that Sunday, I was surprised that I have not been tasting it.

0:23:34.920,0:23:38.120
It does not even come to my memory.

0:23:38.120,0:23:43.400
Even to the taste of soft drinks, it's not like before, I don't know.

0:23:43.400,0:23:48.360
I don't even think about it, and I am somebody that I cannot stay without going out.

0:23:48.360,0:23:50.680
Even when we were there, before going to the club at night,

0:23:50.680,0:23:54.380
sometimes, if it was an ordinary day and we could not go to the club,

0:23:54.380,0:23:59.960
we looked for any hotel, any big hotel we could go to during day time.

0:23:59.960,0:24:02.480
What difference I began to see in my life...

0:24:02.480,0:24:07.760
When I came here, I came like it is a normal Sunday where I would then go back in the evening time.

0:24:07.760,0:24:12.020
I never knew God would arrest me from that Sunday till now here in The SCOAN.

0:24:12.020,0:24:20.880
Tell us, since that last Sunday after your deliverance, do you still have the urge to meet men?

0:24:20.880,0:24:27.660
No, nothing. No urge, nothing again. It's not even coming to my memory.

0:24:27.660,0:24:36.140
To the extent that three days ago, I just sat alone with my phone and blocked everybody on my WhatsApp.

0:24:36.140,0:24:38.680
I just blocked everybody on my WhatsApp.

0:24:38.680,0:24:41.600
To the extent that people are calling me, they cannot get me.

0:24:41.600,0:24:46.260
Sometimes, even some of my friends  are passing through this my friend to even ask

0:24:46.260,0:24:49.060
whether I am okay. They don't know my whereabouts.

0:24:49.060,0:24:53.100
They don't know where I am. I even begged my friend that since they don't know my whereabouts,

0:24:53.100,0:24:56.520
please anybody you see, because she is staying outside the church

0:24:56.520,0:24:59.320
don't let anyone know that I am in the church.

0:24:59.320,0:25:01.120
I blocked all the contacts.

0:25:01.120,0:25:05.900
I decided to do that because I don't want to have any contact with my past life anymore.

0:25:05.900,0:25:10.080
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:25:10.080,0:25:15.380
And lastly, how is your spiritual life since after your deliverance?

0:25:15.380,0:25:19.420
I wake up now and do my prayers.

0:25:19.420,0:25:22.420
Before I was somebody who could not focus on the Bible.

0:25:22.420,0:25:29.560
But for the one week I have been here, I am surprised at the extent on coming back from the Bible class.

0:25:29.560,0:25:36.200
Even if I am learning 100 things in a day and you ask me, I will repeat everything from A-Z.

0:25:36.200,0:25:37.700
I would tell you what I learnt.

0:25:37.700,0:25:41.140
But before when someone preached to me, I could open the Bible on my own.

0:25:41.140,0:25:42.540
You don't have to preach and read.

0:25:42.540,0:25:48.140
Immediately I closed it and you asked me, I couldn't tell you one word.

0:25:48.140,0:25:50.860
How is your relationship with your family since then?

0:25:50.860,0:25:53.600
Since then we are okay. I am thanking God.

0:25:53.600,0:25:56.160
I am back to my family again, we are back together.

0:25:56.160,0:26:01.140
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the King of Glory!

0:26:01.140,0:26:05.120
We thank God Almighty for your life. It's a great deliverance indeed.

0:26:05.120,0:26:10.160
And we know that this is really impacting the lives of millions of people -

0:26:10.160,0:26:12.060
both here and out there.

0:26:12.060,0:26:17.360
Viewers all over the world are learning a great deal from your testimony.

0:26:17.360,0:26:21.800
Before we listen to your advice, we would like to hear from your family members.

0:26:21.800,0:26:25.620
Can we hear from your elder sister?

0:26:25.620,0:26:28.240
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:26:28.240,0:26:32.760
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:26:32.760,0:26:34.880
Indeed God is with us!

0:26:34.880,0:26:37.380
My name is Nkamanyi Delphine

0:26:37.380,0:26:40.420
and they are my family members.

0:26:40.420,0:26:44.160
My younger sister, my dad and my mum.

0:26:44.160,0:26:50.980
Actually, my younger sister has been a pain in the neck of each and every person in my family.

0:26:50.980,0:26:53.900
Especially to her own son.

0:26:53.900,0:27:00.320
Because he has just been growing up like somebody who lost his mum.

0:27:00.320,0:27:05.640
She started this whole show when she was young as you heard her saying.

0:27:05.640,0:27:09.700
My mum could not bear her stubbornness because our dad was not around.

0:27:09.700,0:27:12.920
So my mum decided that she should go to a boarding school

0:27:12.920,0:27:14.460
since she was stubborn.

0:27:14.460,0:27:20.960
Whilst in the boarding school, they just called my mum that she is no longer there.

0:27:20.960,0:27:26.360
There was no way out. We started looking for her but couldn't find her.

0:27:26.360,0:27:32.960
We only got to meet her when she was pregnant as she said.

0:27:32.960,0:27:35.600
She was heavily pregnant.

0:27:35.600,0:27:38.500
We couldn't send her away and she came back to the house.

0:27:38.500,0:27:43.120
We thought that could change her. We had hopes because we had been praying for it.

0:27:43.120,0:27:47.580
But after she gave birth, three to four months later,

0:27:47.580,0:27:51.580
my mum could not bear her leaving the house, going to the night club

0:27:51.580,0:27:54.620
as she was still breastfeeding that is why they had to wean the baby.

0:27:54.620,0:27:57.340
Because there was no way out from the situation.

0:27:57.340,0:28:01.500
Until finally, she found herself here in Nigeria.

0:28:01.500,0:28:03.500
Nobody knew her whereabouts.

0:28:03.500,0:28:06.940
At times, I was the one who used to... when I see her picture on facebook,

0:28:06.940,0:28:11.160
I would try to google the location to know where she is.

0:28:11.160,0:28:17.720
All those sort of things. Not until when I came here to Nigeria.

0:28:17.720,0:28:22.900
Eventually last Sunday, the lost was found.

0:28:22.900,0:28:28.840
Exactly. I was so shocked myself even though I knew It was going to happen.

0:28:28.840,0:28:32.540
While I was in my hotel room, she came as she rightly said and

0:28:32.540,0:28:35.440
she took the Morning Water and went back.

0:28:35.440,0:28:39.120
I was there fasting and praying incessantly.

0:28:39.120,0:28:41.080
And she told me that she was going to come.

0:28:41.080,0:28:44.920
But she switched off her phone. I came back to church again on that Sunday.

0:28:44.920,0:28:46.540
Because when her number was not going through,

0:28:46.540,0:28:49.700
I knew she would not come to church. I just made up my mind that

0:28:49.700,0:28:53.120
I was going to cut the connection with her, she was no more my sister.

0:28:53.120,0:28:55.580
But when I came on that Sunday, two weeks ago,

0:28:55.580,0:29:01.960
when the man of God was preaching, the sermon was all about 'coming here is not ordinary'.

0:29:01.960,0:29:05.340
That if you are here, it is because you are not ordinary.

0:29:05.340,0:29:09.400
That if you want somebody to come here, and the person is not here,

0:29:09.400,0:29:14.020
don't break the contact with that person because if you do that you are going to offend God.

0:29:14.020,0:29:16.420
I was so touched.

0:29:16.420,0:29:19.680
So since after your sister's deliverance

0:29:19.680,0:29:23.960
through the prophecy last Sunday, can you tell us who your sister is now,

0:29:23.960,0:29:29.700
as against who she was before, when she was living that wayward life.

0:29:29.700,0:29:35.240
She is really a changed person because I was always the last person she could talk to.

0:29:35.240,0:29:38.380
But now, we sit, we pray together.

0:29:38.380,0:29:43.320
At times I would want to come to the altar for prayers and I would meet her there - I would be shocked.

0:29:43.320,0:29:44.820
She comes to the altar before you?

0:29:44.820,0:29:45.480
Yes!

0:29:45.700,0:29:46.760
Since after her deliverance?

0:29:46.760,0:29:47.660
Yes!

0:29:47.660,0:29:50.120
Then, she goes to the Bible classes.

0:29:50.120,0:29:52.740
Miss Delphine & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:29:52.740,0:29:57.860
Sometimes, she would sit and talk to me about her business plans.

0:29:57.860,0:30:02.280
What she wants to do with her life, her way forward. It is like - wow.

0:30:02.280,0:30:07.560
There is something happening in her life spiritually that I cannot see.

0:30:07.560,0:30:11.080
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:30:11.080,0:30:12.740
Thank you very much.

0:30:12.740,0:30:15.800
So let us hear from Daddy.

0:30:15.800,0:30:20.200
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:30:20.200,0:30:23.740
God is great indeed.

0:30:23.740,0:30:25.200
Your name?

0:30:25.200,0:30:29.100
I am Nkamanyi Moses.

0:30:29.100,0:30:37.200
I am a medical personnel by profession and a professional coach - soccer coach.

0:30:37.200,0:30:41.580
This is my daughter, Kelly.

0:30:41.580,0:30:43.900
And that is her elder sister.

0:30:43.900,0:30:50.660
As I said, I am a medical personnel by profession and a professional soccer coach.

0:30:50.660,0:30:55.580
I am a member of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America

0:30:55.580,0:31:02.180
and a member of the Black Soccer Coaches Committee.

0:31:02.180,0:31:12.160
I have an advance diploma in coaching in the USA.

0:31:12.160,0:31:18.320
Tell us, for how many years did you not see your daughter ?

0:31:18.320,0:31:25.100
until God used the man of God to locate her here.

0:31:25.100,0:31:26.420
For how many years?

0:31:26.420,0:31:33.560
Almost forever because they are talking of three to four years.

0:31:33.560,0:31:42.020
But the past couple of years, I was in the U.S. and when I came back, I could not see her.

0:31:42.020,0:31:50.220
I have been asking, until last year October when I came to The SCOAN, I asked for her number,

0:31:50.220,0:31:53.100
I called and got her.

0:31:53.100,0:31:57.120
But when I got here, she was nowhere to be found.

0:31:57.120,0:32:01.520
But I was opportune to have the Morning Water, which I went back with.

0:32:01.520,0:32:07.100
I brought my family together, and we prayed and made mention of her.

0:32:07.100,0:32:14.720
Believe me, no father wants to stay without seeing his child.

0:32:14.720,0:32:22.360
And when I was in the U.S., they told me she was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy.

0:32:22.360,0:32:31.880
Okay, but all this while your daughter disappeared from home, did you know what she was doing out there?

0:32:31.880,0:32:41.060
Infact, any child who is out of home and is doing well will inform the parents or the family.

0:32:41.060,0:32:47.860
It means she was doing what we did not like, that is... she said it here that she was doing prostitution.

0:32:47.860,0:32:53.940
Which of course is not something that I would want my child, my daughter, to do.

0:32:53.940,0:32:58.980
No father, no parent would want his/her daughter to do prostitution.

0:32:58.980,0:33:05.080
She talked about drinking alcohol - whiskey. I don't drink.

0:33:05.080,0:33:08.120
If I take a bottle of beer, that is too much for me.

0:33:08.120,0:33:11.960
I am a medical personnel, and I was playing football when I was young.

0:33:11.960,0:33:17.000
I played even for the junior national team back in Cameroon.

0:33:17.000,0:33:23.580
I don't drink alcohol, so seeing my daughter drinking and taking dry whiskey -

0:33:23.580,0:33:26.460
that is something surprising to me

0:33:26.460,0:33:32.900
Okay, so this, obviously, must have given you so much pain.

0:33:32.900,0:33:37.340
Until you found your daughter here at The SCOAN,

0:33:37.340,0:33:44.200
did you ever think or believe that you would see your daughter again,

0:33:44.200,0:33:47.780
having disappeared from home for many years.

0:33:47.780,0:33:56.160
Never! Never! I knew I was going to get her here. That is why I came here last October.

0:33:56.160,0:34:01.020
That is why we sent her elder sister to be here.

0:34:01.020,0:34:06.500
This is the fourth week her elder sister has been in Lagos, praying.

0:34:06.500,0:34:11.880
When I got here last Saturday, in my hotel room I was praying throughout.

0:34:11.880,0:34:20.040
On Sunday morning, before I got here, I was praying throughout, using the Morning Water.

0:34:20.040,0:34:26.960
And believe me on that Sunday, I was In church right here.

0:34:26.960,0:34:31.600
The restroom is behind; the restaurant is behind.

0:34:31.600,0:34:35.400
I don't know what took me out of the door this way.

0:34:35.400,0:34:37.400
And you intended to go to the restroom?

0:34:37.400,0:34:39.540
I got out...

0:34:39.540,0:34:41.880
But you found yourself going out through another door?

0:34:41.880,0:34:45.580
This is a wonderful place. I don't know - this is a wonderful place.

0:34:45.580,0:34:47.580
Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!

0:34:47.580,0:34:50.700
Mr Moses Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:34:50.700,0:34:53.040
So when you came out?

0:34:53.040,0:35:03.100
As soon I got out, I saw her coming in with her friend from the gate. When I saw her, I stood.

0:35:03.100,0:35:09.180
I didn't make any move because I thought if she saw me, she would run out.

0:35:10.040,0:35:16.620
So I stood and I was watching her chatting with her friend and coming in.

0:35:16.640,0:35:23.700
She got right in front of me and raised her head and when she saw me, she almost fell.

0:35:23.700,0:35:30.660
She almost dropped. I said, "Don't bother. God has brought you. This is the arena of liberty".

0:35:30.660,0:35:32.620
Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:35:32.620,0:35:34.860
Mr Moses Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:35:34.860,0:35:40.220
So, Sir, since last Sunday after the prophecy and the deliverance, tell us,

0:35:40.220,0:35:45.580
what do you see in your daughter now  that you really glorify God for?

0:35:45.580,0:35:53.980
To be honest with you, in the past she was communicating with her mother and sister

0:35:53.980,0:36:00.400
but never with me because when I was back home, when she was young,

0:36:00.400,0:36:05.700
I was really handling her and I know she left home maybe because

0:36:05.700,0:36:10.940
I left Cameroon for the U.S. and stayed there for a long while.

0:36:10.940,0:36:18.360
After her deliverance, believe me, I have seen a new person in her.

0:36:18.360,0:36:22.960
Mr Moses Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:36:22.960,0:36:27.200
She gets up in the morning and she wants to talk to me.

0:36:27.200,0:36:31.740
She has been here and I was still in my hotel room.

0:36:31.740,0:36:34.840
But she would always want to see me and the mum.

0:36:34.840,0:36:41.040
That is very strange. It means she has started recognising the family.

0:36:41.040,0:36:47.480
She is now with the family and I can see some happiness in her.

0:36:47.480,0:36:51.580
I can see her very happy to be with us and

0:36:51.580,0:36:56.940
she was insisting to get her stuffs from where she was living.

0:36:56.940,0:37:02.660
To get her stuffs and go back home to meet the rest of her family members.

0:37:02.660,0:37:09.620
That is wonderful. I would really want to say that this is really the arena of liberty.

0:37:09.620,0:37:12.060
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:37:12.060,0:37:13.640
Mr Moses Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:37:13.640,0:37:17.020
Thank you very much, sir.

0:37:17.020,0:37:22.280
Let's listen to mama.

0:37:22.300,0:37:26.120
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:37:26.120,0:37:32.140
My name is Nkamanyi Anne, and the person next to me is my lovely daughter.

0:37:32.140,0:37:36.980
The next one is my lovely brother, my only brother and the father to all of us.

0:37:36.980,0:37:39.080
The father to all of us.

0:37:39.080,0:37:41.480
The other one is also my daughter.

0:37:41.480,0:37:44.260
Anne Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:37:44.260,0:37:50.080
This my daughter has made me to be confused in the home.

0:37:50.080,0:37:54.160
For four years now, I have not been seeing her. She started calling me.

0:37:54.160,0:38:00.360
When I also called her, she would just switch off her phone. When I say, "Kelly, where are you?"

0:38:00.360,0:38:03.200
She would say, "Don't disturb me" and switch off her phone.

0:38:03.200,0:38:05.960
She would stay again for about two months

0:38:05.960,0:38:12.560
When she calls again, I would not want to ask her of her whereabouts. I would just be petting her,

0:38:12.560,0:38:16.820
"Where mummy? Come and see us. Your son is really anxious to see you!

0:38:16.820,0:38:22.880
"You want to kill us? Come and see your son". She would switch off her phone.

0:38:22.880,0:38:29.440
Recently, it was bad. My brother came here.

0:38:29.440,0:38:34.020
I think it was last year October, just  because of her situation.

0:38:34.020,0:38:39.120
He always tried. I gave her number to my brother.

0:38:39.120,0:38:42.420
He came here and called her. They were communicating.

0:38:42.420,0:38:48.720
But when my brother came here, he called and behold, she just switched off her phone.

0:38:48.720,0:38:53.380
She told him that she will come and meet him here in The SCOAN.

0:38:53.380,0:38:57.800
But when that day came, she just switched off her phone.

0:38:57.800,0:38:59.920
So it has been on and off like that?

0:38:59.920,0:39:01.040
Yes!

0:39:01.040,0:39:07.120
The pain. The pain to have a daughter like this one and then she just disappears.

0:39:07.120,0:39:16.320
Anne Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:39:16.320,0:39:20.820
What else can that be but the tears of joy.

0:39:20.820,0:39:23.660
Really! Really!

0:39:23.660,0:39:33.120
So last Sunday, your daughter was found and God gave a prophetic message to his able servant

0:39:33.120,0:39:37.420
that there was a lady that was lost but was found here.

0:39:37.420,0:39:41.820
How do you feel since last Sunday, and what are the changes that you have seen in her life?

0:39:41.820,0:39:45.480
All of us were very happy because we were surprised.

0:39:45.480,0:39:51.480
This was my first time of coming here,  and the man of God does not know me.

0:39:51.480,0:39:54.580
I don't know him. I only watch him on the screen.

0:39:54.580,0:40:04.080
But I was very surprised when we came out here and the man of God said, "Lost and found, Miss Cameroon".

0:40:04.080,0:40:10.400
I said, "Okay, they have given here a very big title - Miss Cameroon".

0:40:10.400,0:40:16.580
We were very happy, all of us were very happy because she was holding me, I was holding her.

0:40:16.580,0:40:24.500
We were happy together, the son, all of them at home were watching her.

0:40:24.500,0:40:28.040
And since that last Sunday, how have you been relating with your daughter and

0:40:28.040,0:40:32.100
how has she been relating with you and other members of the family?

0:40:32.100,0:40:36.220
Of course, we are fine - everything has changed. I have really seen her.

0:40:36.220,0:40:38.320
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:40:38.320,0:40:41.000
Anne Nkamanyi & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:40:41.000,0:40:43.640
Thank you!

0:40:43.640,0:40:47.940
Our sister... Wow, we can see you are overwhelmed with joy.

0:40:47.940,0:40:53.180
You didn't know that life in Christ Jesus was this sweet?

0:40:53.180,0:40:55.740
Very sweet!

0:40:55.740,0:40:57.020
Yes!

0:40:57.020,0:41:02.980
Now we want to listen to your advice, but before then, this life you were living.

0:41:02.980,0:41:08.360
All this money you used to make. Can you give any account of it?

0:41:08.360,0:41:13.600
Maybe you have built a house, bought cars, investments.

0:41:13.600,0:41:16.680
No account. It's just like a blood money.

0:41:16.680,0:41:18.100
No account.

0:41:18.100,0:41:22.880
You see the money but you don't know what you do with it.

0:41:22.880,0:41:25.120
So the way it came, it just went like that?

0:41:25.120,0:41:26.080
It just went like that.

0:41:26.080,0:41:28.600
You see the money quite alright but there is nothing that you can do with it.

0:41:28.600,0:41:30.940
So when the money used to come, what did you do with it?

0:41:30.940,0:41:34.400
I don't know, maybe I drink, get dresses for myself, a new hairstyle.

0:41:34.400,0:41:38.280
Just do things that will still get you to the club to do the business. Finish!

0:41:38.280,0:41:43.080
Just to maintain that lifestyle. No investment.

0:41:43.080,0:41:48.300
This life you started living at the early age of 15 -

0:41:48.300,0:41:53.040
you bolted out of the house and started following men, doing prostitution.

0:41:53.040,0:41:59.380
How did you manage your education? Were you able to finish your school, your secondary school?

0:41:59.380,0:42:04.120
No, I didn't finish my school because I ran away from school. I was in a boarding school.

0:42:04.120,0:42:05.720
You were in a boarding school?

0:42:05.720,0:42:06.220
Yes.

0:42:06.220,0:42:07.960
And you couldn't complete your secondary school?

0:42:07.960,0:42:10.240
I couldn't complete it. I disappeared, I jumped over the fence.

0:42:10.240,0:42:17.080
It was one of the students that discovered I wasn't living in the school.

0:42:17.080,0:42:21.120
because we went out overnight, jumping over the fence.

0:42:21.120,0:42:23.920
So this really robbed you of your education?

0:42:23.920,0:42:25.040
Yes!

0:42:25.040,0:42:36.100
Now, we would like you to advise the world, the whole world entirely.

0:42:36.100,0:42:40.060
What word of advice do you have for them?

0:42:40.060,0:42:46.340
My advice to all my friends, especially the ones out there watching me right now.

0:42:46.340,0:42:50.480
Because I know they are watching me. They watched me last week Sunday.

0:42:50.480,0:42:52.640
Your X-friends?

0:42:52.640,0:42:54.340
My X-friends.

0:42:54.340,0:42:56.340
You mean those who are still...

0:42:56.340,0:43:01.060
Those who are still in my past life, into prostitution. Now they are my X-friends.

0:43:01.060,0:43:06.920
My present friends will only be people that are the same in Christ - like me here.

0:43:06.920,0:43:08.940
Halleluyah.

0:43:08.940,0:43:11.740
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:43:11.740,0:43:17.580
The only advice I would give them is - nothing like God.

0:43:17.580,0:43:21.620
Because there is nothing out there. I have passed through a lot.

0:43:21.620,0:43:25.640
Today as you see me standing here, if you look at me, since morning I have been full of joy.

0:43:25.640,0:43:30.360
I am proud to be here, giving my testimony. I dont care what anyone would say.

0:43:30.360,0:43:32.480
I don't care how people will look at me and what they will say.

0:43:32.480,0:43:35.180
i don't care about what I will pass through

0:43:35.180,0:43:40.740
because I believe that now you are looking at me, I am better than all of you right now.

0:43:40.740,0:43:45.600
So if you look at me, I am very full of happiness for the kind of testimony I have.

0:43:45.600,0:43:49.780
Even when the man of God who located me used that word 'prostitute',

0:43:49.780,0:43:52.620
some people would be standing here, crying.

0:43:52.620,0:43:55.480
I cannot cry, I am not regretting. I am laughing.

0:43:55.480,0:43:57.620
I know some people will ask, "Why is she laughing?"

0:43:57.620,0:44:04.740
I have to laugh because I am so happy and now I belong to God - it's a pride.

0:44:04.740,0:44:06.580
Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:44:06.580,0:44:08.000
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:44:08.000,0:44:13.720
To the world at large, what advice do you have for them?

0:44:13.720,0:44:16.720
The advice I have for them is that as they are watching me right now,

0:44:16.720,0:44:25.980
I would like everyone of them to repent, even though it is not easy

0:44:25.980,0:44:28.760
because it was not easy for me.

0:44:28.760,0:44:34.080
But anybody who is ready to be like me, I will advise them, I haven't abandoned anybody.

0:44:34.080,0:44:36.620
Through me, they can still get help,

0:44:36.620,0:44:40.040
and through me also, they can still have the opportunity to be here

0:44:40.040,0:44:44.560
because I am ready to help anyone of them except those that are not ready to change.

0:44:44.560,0:44:47.740
Because as for me, I am gone; bye, bye forever !

0:44:47.740,0:44:55.980
Miss Kelly & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:44:55.980,0:44:59.580
You have escaped satan's captivity.

0:44:59.580,0:45:00.460
Far, far away.

0:45:00.460,0:45:02.420
Hallelujah.

0:45:02.420,0:45:09.000
What advice do you have for parents who are listening to you right now?

0:45:09.000,0:45:15.480
What advice I have for parents is that if your child is living the kind of life I was living,

0:45:15.480,0:45:21.640
whatever she tells you she is doing, working here or doing business in this place,

0:45:21.640,0:45:24.920
I would still advise you to always put her in prayers.

0:45:24.920,0:45:28.260
Because I believe with prayers, everything is possible.

0:45:28.260,0:45:31.500
And with your prayers, someday you will find out what she is doing

0:45:31.500,0:45:33.220
and everything will come to an end.

0:45:33.220,0:45:36.140
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:45:36.140,0:45:37.960
Thank you!

0:45:37.960,0:45:48.220
And lastly, today you are filled with joy, testifying to that wonderful deliverance you have received.

0:45:48.220,0:45:53.960
If you were to look back to your life generally, what would you say

0:45:53.960,0:46:00.080
you regretted doing in your life. What do you regret most that you have done with your life?

0:46:00.080,0:46:06.460
I regret many things I have done in my past life, and number one as an example...

0:46:06.460,0:46:10.720
Because there are a lot of things where I cannot show an example. but for one I can show an example.

0:46:10.720,0:46:16.280
One of the things that people can see, viewers all over the world, because I am proud

0:46:16.280,0:46:21.900
of everybody watching Emmanuel TV to see me standing here because it is an opportunity for everyone.

0:46:21.900,0:46:30.680
So the tattoo on my neck. You can see it. This is like an evidence - an example.

0:46:30.680,0:46:36.620
This is the only thing I can present here - the tattoo on my neck - because I did it when I was on the street.

0:46:36.620,0:46:41.900
When I started moving around, this is how I did this one here.

0:46:41.900,0:46:44.300
This is it!

0:46:44.300,0:46:49.380
As a club girl and at the same time as a stubborn child - all together.

0:46:49.380,0:46:58.840
And this one I also got on my arm.

0:46:58.840,0:47:02.720
Today you regret doing this to yourself?

0:47:02.720,0:47:08.360
I regret doing these things to myself. There are a lot of things I regret in my life.

0:47:08.360,0:47:12.300
There are a lot that people will not see - it's too much. I will not be able to go through them all here.

0:47:12.980,0:47:18.360
We have heard from her. Her friend is also here.

0:47:18.360,0:47:23.740
My name is Elizabeth Akinyemi Iyabo. I am from Ondo State.

0:47:23.740,0:47:28.200
This is my mum and here are my children.

0:47:28.200,0:47:32.000
I have been a prostitute for six years now.

0:47:32.000,0:47:39.860
It was through my friend that the man of God located me on Sunday in the church.

0:47:39.860,0:47:44.440
I started doing it out of ignorance.

0:47:44.440,0:47:48.960
I was working as a hairstylist.

0:47:48.960,0:47:52.520
A friend called me and told me that they were looking for girls

0:47:52.520,0:47:58.540
to go to Dubai who were very good hairdressers and they'd make a lot of money.

0:47:58.540,0:48:05.020
I said, "Ah, if they chose me, I would be very happy and I would go with them".

0:48:05.020,0:48:10.880
Out of 25 people, they selected 8 of us.

0:48:10.880,0:48:17.940
I asked how we were going to sponsor ourselves because I didn't even have the money for a passport

0:48:17.940,0:48:20.800
because they were paying me 4000 naira monthly.

0:48:20.800,0:48:24.300
She said that it wasn't a problem. They would pay for everything and when we got there

0:48:24.300,0:48:26.140
we would know how to pay back.

0:48:26.140,0:48:31.420
When we got there, we did prostitution.

0:48:31.420,0:48:38.600
At night we dressed half naked and wore a long black gown on top

0:48:38.600,0:48:43.460
and a head gear. Then, a taxi would come and take us to the club.

0:48:43.460,0:48:48.200
When we got to the club, we would remove the long gown and the head gear.

0:48:48.200,0:48:55.020
We would be dressed half naked in the club and go with different kind of men.

0:48:55.020,0:48:58.400
That was how we did it for four months.

0:48:58.400,0:49:04.220
Along the line, I got caught and spent two months in prison

0:49:04.220,0:49:07.660
before I was then deported back to Nigeria.

0:49:07.680,0:49:14.260
I started going to clubs and did prostitution here in Nigeria.

0:49:14.260,0:49:22.520
I got an opportunity to go to Malaysia; that was where I met my baby's father.

0:49:22.520,0:49:29.060
It was in a club that they introduced me to another boss.

0:49:29.060,0:49:34.540
He told me that I should pay 20,000 dollars, and I paid 18,000 dollars.

0:49:34.540,0:49:41.080
I then met my baby's father who is from UK.

0:49:41.080,0:49:44.580
He said he wanted to marry me and asked if I had a boss.

0:49:44.580,0:49:47.980
He called my boss and said that he would pay the money,

0:49:47.980,0:49:54.080
That I should forget about everything and start living with him.

0:49:54.080,0:49:57.860
Later, I got pregnant for him.

0:49:57.860,0:50:05.260
He found out that I was deported from Dubai and was very angry with me.

0:50:05.260,0:50:09.460
He told me to come back to Nigeria and try to get another passport.

0:50:09.460,0:50:14.360
so that I could go to Dubai or the UK from there.

0:50:14.360,0:50:21.140
That was how I lost contact with him. When I called him, he no longer picked my calls.

0:50:21.140,0:50:24.100
I continued doing prostitution.

0:50:24.100,0:50:27.520
My mother never knew that I was a prostitute.

0:50:27.520,0:50:36.700
When I went home monthly, I'd give her money and sponsored my brother to the university.

0:50:36.700,0:50:45.740
I then met the father of my second baby. I got pregnant.

0:50:45.740,0:50:47.460
Whilst you were doing the work of prostitution?

0:50:47.460,0:50:49.020
Yes.

0:50:49.020,0:50:52.800
Three months after I gave birth, the baby died.

0:50:52.800,0:51:00.260
My brother whom I sponsored to university also died.

0:51:00.260,0:51:10.540
I didn't have anything else to do. I went back to that life again.

0:51:10.540,0:51:13.440
So that was how you continued?

0:51:13.440,0:51:19.100
I met my friend - we had lost contact for a very long time.

0:51:19.100,0:51:23.900
She called me and asked me where I was and I told her I was at home.

0:51:23.900,0:51:27.620
She told me to come over to Lekki. I told her that I didn't have transport fare.

0:51:27.620,0:51:32.480
She asked me what was going on and I told her I didn't know.

0:51:32.480,0:51:38.860
She came to my house and told me not to worry that she would pay for my transport fare

0:51:38.860,0:51:41.440
that we were going to go out on Saturday so that I would have money.

0:51:41.440,0:51:45.060
I explained to her that my son was no longer going to school

0:51:45.060,0:51:48.300
because I didn't have money for school fees.

0:51:48.320,0:51:53.940
She said that we would go to the club on Saturday

0:51:53.940,0:51:58.640
On Saturday, we were preparing to go to the club but we slept off.

0:51:58.640,0:52:04.320
Since last Sunday you received the prophecy from the man of God

0:52:04.320,0:52:08.640
and your deliverance, tell us of the changes in your life.

0:52:08.640,0:52:12.840
A lot of changes.

0:52:12.840,0:52:17.540
I am so happy now. I am now a changed person.

0:52:17.540,0:52:20.960
Do you still have the urge to meet men, to go out for prostitution?

0:52:20.960,0:52:24.120
Never again! Never in my life!

0:52:24.120,0:52:26.180
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:52:26.180,0:52:29.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:52:29.040,0:52:34.780
Viewers and the people right inside the church,

0:52:34.780,0:52:37.980
the sister said she is free; whatever you can do to support her.

0:52:37.980,0:52:46.800
Most especially the one that has two children. Please do so.

0:52:46.800,0:52:54.300
She really needs your support now because these little children have to live

0:52:54.300,0:52:57.020
and go to school.

0:52:57.020,0:53:04.440
If you don't want her to sell the children or to trade the children for money,

0:53:04.440,0:53:07.000
they need your support.

0:53:07.000,0:53:09.620
Hallelujah.

0:53:09.620,0:53:14.960
Members, we need to come together. Whatever you can do now, please wait behind.

0:53:14.960,0:53:21.780
Whatever you can do before you leave the church. You just have to support these children.

0:53:21.780,0:53:25.500
You can see the family; you can see the mama. That is it.

0:53:25.500,0:53:32.660
Their family is not beyond this; it's those two people. They have no one.

0:53:32.660,0:53:40.080
These children must go to school. They must be cared for. We say she is delivered.

0:53:40.080,0:53:43.760
To maintain that deliverance, she needs support.

0:53:43.760,0:53:48.540
God has done His part. It is God who has delivered her.

0:53:48.540,0:53:57.840
You have to support her. We have a role to play to maintain our blessing.

0:53:57.840,0:54:03.860
So for her to maintain this blessing - your support.

0:54:03.860,0:54:06.380
You let her wait somewhere there.

0:54:06.380,0:54:10.700
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:54:10.700,0:54:14.700
You have just watched the clip. That is how the prophecy came

0:54:14.700,0:54:20.460
and she was delivered, and we also heard the comment of the anointed man of God.

0:54:20.460,0:54:23.960
Right now, we are going to listen once again to the sister.

0:54:23.960,0:54:30.520
She is here to continue her testimony of what God Almighty has done in her life

0:54:30.520,0:54:34.380
and also to get the fulfilment of that promise.

0:54:34.380,0:54:37.900
My name is Akinyemi Elizabeth Iyabo.

0:54:37.900,0:54:42.460
I am from Ondo State.

0:54:42.460,0:54:46.320
These are my children and this is my mum.

0:54:46.320,0:54:53.720
I am an ex-international prostitute - going from one country to another,

0:54:53.720,0:55:00.040
selling myself for money, jumping from one bed to another.

0:55:00.040,0:55:06.700
Thank God, three weeks ago, I came to The SCOAN with my friend

0:55:06.700,0:55:10.860
and the man of God prophesied that there was a girl from Cameroon,

0:55:10.860,0:55:14.860
who had been missing for many years and that she should come out.

0:55:14.860,0:55:19.900
She has just located her family here at The SCOAN.

0:55:19.900,0:55:24.560
She came out and the man of God asked her to go and bring her friend.

0:55:24.560,0:55:35.200
I never knew that would be the day that my story from one bed to another, doing prostitution,

0:55:35.200,0:55:41.640
from one hotel to another, from one club to another, would come to an end.

0:55:41.640,0:55:49.180
I thank God for the deliverance, healing and everything God has been doing since then.

0:55:49.180,0:55:58.020
I thank God for the man of God who asked the people of God to come out and help me

0:55:58.020,0:55:59.640
and they did.

0:55:59.640,0:56:07.660
Ok. Tell us - since after your deliverance, how much has your life changed?

0:56:07.660,0:56:14.380
My life has totally changed from my past life.

0:56:14.380,0:56:20.560
The life I am living now, I am so happy. I am now a free person in Christ Jesus.

0:56:20.560,0:56:24.040
You mean that you no longer move from one place to another?

0:56:24.040,0:56:28.480
Never again. No more jumping from one bed to another.

0:56:28.480,0:56:31.420
And now you are able to settle down to take care of your children?

0:56:31.420,0:56:34.560
I am ready to settle down to take care of my children

0:56:34.560,0:56:36.640
and to look for something good to do from now on.

0:56:36.640,0:56:39.040
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:56:39.040,0:56:42.600
Elizabeth & Family (Prophecy Testimony)

0:56:42.600,0:56:46.580
We thank God Almighty for your life and without further to do,

0:56:46.580,0:56:53.540
we shall go straight to deliver the message from our father in the Lord.

0:56:53.540,0:57:01.340
After her testimony on last Sunday, the man of God made a call to all members

0:57:01.340,0:57:08.820
of the congregation to assist our sister financially so that she could settle down

0:57:08.820,0:57:18.420
and do something to take care of herself and also the children that she has with her.

0:57:18.420,0:57:29.120
In response to that, members of the church made this wonderful contribution.

0:57:29.120,0:57:32.260
The bible says, giving is the beginning of blessing.

0:57:32.260,0:57:42.440
As we have contributed today, the lady is being blessed with the cash sum of 500,000 naira.

0:57:42.440,0:57:48.940
Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners Give a Cash Gift of 500,000 Naira & The Mirror

0:57:48.940,0:57:55.220
That is the money that was contributed in cash - 500,000 naira.

0:57:55.220,0:57:59.600
We would also like to let you know that this is not the end.

0:57:59.600,0:58:04.260
We know what our God can do. Our Lord God Almighty will continue the supply

0:58:04.260,0:58:09.820
and she will come back very soon to testify to the glory of God in Jesus' name.

0:58:09.820,0:58:11.980
Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:58:22.600,0:58:30.800
I appreciate and thank you all for the conribution you have made for me and my family.

0:58:30.800,0:58:35.580
I will always remain faithful and will never let you down.

0:58:35.580,0:58:42.000
I promise that I will come back to the church to give my testimony.

0:58:42.000,0:58:46.840
I will make good use of this money.

0:58:46.840,0:58:49.300
Thank you to our daddy in the Lord.

0:58:53.500,0:58:56.440
Mama, I believe those are tears of joy?

0:58:56.440,0:58:59.720
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

0:58:59.720,0:59:05.740
T.B. Joshua, you are a great. Man of God, you are great. You are really a man of God.

0:59:05.740,0:59:09.740
I will continue to pray for you all the days of my life. Thank you.

0:59:09.740,0:59:12.660
I have a song to sing.

0:59:12.660,0:59:27.820
I never knew You would favour me this way

0:59:27.820,0:59:33.420
As You favour me this way, I lift up Your name

0:59:33.420,0:59:35.100
Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!

0:59:35.100,0:59:39.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners Give a Cash Gift of 500,000 Naira & The Mirror

0:59:39.060,0:59:49.180
A wonderful favour indeed and also alongside the cash gift, we have 'The Mirror' book

0:59:49.180,0:59:54.940
by the anointed man of God. This will also guide you in your walk of salvation.

0:59:54.940,1:00:01.620
We also give thanks to all those who made this meaningful contribution to the life of our sister,

1:00:01.620,1:00:06.020
to make sure that she does not go back to the street but settles down, does her business

1:00:06.020,1:00:09.560
and is able to take care of herself and her children.

1:00:09.560,1:00:14.660
Sister, now that you have received this wonderful blessing, we want to encourage you

1:00:14.660,1:00:21.720
to stay true to God Almighty, to walk in the light of your testimony and go into a business

1:00:21.720,1:00:25.660
that will enable you to take care of yourself and your children

1:00:25.660,1:00:30.120
and we believe that very soon you are coming back for a testimony in Jesus' name!

1:00:30.120,1:00:31.080
Amen!

1:00:31.080,1:00:33.180
Thank you very much. Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

TESTIMONY CONTINUES

1:03:27.380,1:03:30.520
My name is Nkamanyi Kelly. I am from Cameroon.

1:03:30.520,1:03:35.600
The people standing next to me are my family - my sister, mum and dad.

1:03:35.600,1:03:40.540
Can you tell us exactly what brought about your testimony today?

1:03:40.540,1:03:43.960
I was in the church last two weeks Sunday.

1:03:43.960,1:03:50.840
When the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prophesied about a girl

1:03:50.840,1:04:00.360
who was lost for four years and the parents have just found her in church that Sunday.

1:04:00.360,1:04:05.900
I came out and confirmed that the prophecy is so true.

1:04:05.900,1:04:08.720
Miss Kelly & Family (Deliverance Testimony)

1:04:08.720,1:04:15.820
It is true because I left my family for four years and I was into prostitution.

1:04:15.820,1:04:25.860
But now I have been delivered after the man of God delivered me.

1:04:25.860,1:04:34.200
After God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver me, the spirit of prostitution is out of me.

1:04:34.200,1:04:36.520
I am a new creation in Christ.

1:04:36.520,1:04:44.140
Since then, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has been feeding me with the Word of God

1:04:44.140,1:04:45.820
and taking care of me.

1:04:45.820,1:04:48.480
I am so honoured for everything.

1:04:48.480,1:04:53.240
You mean, since you've been delivered, the spirit of prostitution has left you and

1:04:53.240,1:04:56.980
now you no longer have that urge to go to prostitution any more?

1:04:56.980,1:04:57.740
Yes!

1:04:57.740,1:05:00.560
What are the changes you have seen in you after your deliverance?

1:05:00.560,1:05:06.620
So many changes - like not having the urge to be with men again,

1:05:06.620,1:05:16.720
the spirit of going out, the spirit of drinking alcohol, so many things.

1:05:16.720,1:05:22.020
I now see how wrong it is to go into prostitution.

1:05:22.020,1:05:28.000
To God be the glory. Now that you have been delivered, we thank God Almighty for your life

1:05:28.000,1:05:31.760
because we now know you are a new creation in Christ Jesus.

1:05:31.760,1:05:36.660
Old things have passed away and all things have become new.

1:05:36.660,1:05:40.720
The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, in his usual kindness

1:05:40.720,1:05:44.620
and with the support of Emmanuel TV Partners,

1:05:44.620,1:05:51.860
said that we should present this cash gift to you - the sum of 150,000 naira -

1:05:51.860,1:05:54.940
for you to start a new life in Christ Jesus.

1:05:54.940,1:06:00.120
Given 150,000 Naira & 60,000 Naira for Transportation by T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

1:06:00.120,1:06:09.560
And also the sum of 60,000 naira for your transportation back to your country.

1:06:09.560,1:06:12.260
I want to say, Thank You, Jesus!

1:06:12.260,1:06:21.240
Thank you, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.

1:06:21.240,1:06:28.000
Thank you all. Thank you for supporting me with the sum of 150,000 naira

1:06:28.000,1:06:34.900
and the sum of 60,000 for our transportation back home.

1:06:34.900,1:06:38.820
Because we never expected this. I didn't expect this.

1:06:38.820,1:06:43.720
I came here with a problem and I even expected to pay.

1:06:43.720,1:06:48.200
I didn't pay anything. I was delivered free of charge.

1:06:48.200,1:06:55.200
And now man of God has given me a sum of 150,000 Naira to start a new life.

1:06:55.200,1:06:59.620
The man of God was taking care of me throughout my stay in the church:

1:06:59.620,1:07:06.580
Feeding me and taking care of me and as I am going home, he has blessed me again

1:07:06.580,1:07:11.220
to start a new life. I am happy. Thank You, Jesus!

1:07:11.220,1:07:14.980
My name is Nkamanyi Delphine. I am from Cameroon.

1:07:14.980,1:07:18.520
Indeed, it is a great joy. I don't know how to start appreciating the man of God

1:07:18.520,1:07:22.300
because he has always been like the lordship in the family.

1:07:22.300,1:07:26.140
The lost has been found through the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:07:26.140,1:07:30.780
All I have to say is, Thank You, Jesus!

1:07:30.780,1:07:35.300
After delivering her, the man of God supported her financially

1:07:35.300,1:07:40.400
with the sum of 150,000 naira for her to start a new life.

1:07:40.400,1:07:45.860
In fact, the man of God has established her in order for her not to go back to her past.

1:07:45.860,1:07:47.980
This is a wonderful thing.

1:07:47.980,1:07:52.700
In addition to that, the man of God gave us transportation to go back to our country -

1:07:52.700,1:07:55.920
the sum of 60,000 naira.

1:07:55.920,1:08:03.180
May the Lord bless him, and also bless Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.

1:08:03.180,1:08:04.720
Thank you very much.

1:08:04.720,1:08:11.800
I thank God Almighty for what He has done to the life of my daughter.

1:08:11.800,1:08:16.680
Ever since she was delivered, she is a new creation now.

1:08:16.680,1:08:22.060
She is behaving well now, and the man of God kept us here for a week,

1:08:22.060,1:08:28.040
caring for us, feeding us, accommodating us. We are very grateful for that.

1:08:28.040,1:08:36.360
Now he has established my daughter with a sum of 150,000 naira

1:08:36.360,1:08:43.240
and he gave us transportation - 60,000 naira - to go back to our country.

1:08:43.240,1:08:49.960
May the Lord bless the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world. Thank you.

1:08:49.960,1:08:51.600
Amen.

1:08:51.600,1:08:53.360
Thank you soo much.

1:08:53.360,1:08:55.400
I am Nkamanyi Moses.

1:08:55.400,1:09:02.040
Next to me is my daughter, Kelly Nkamanyi, her sister and the mum.

1:09:02.040,1:09:08.880
Believe me, I am so overwhelmed with what I have seen here at The SCOAN.

1:09:08.880,1:09:13.120
This is wonderful because we came here

1:09:13.120,1:09:20.440
and the man of God discovered Kelly, who had been missing for about three to four years.

1:09:20.440,1:09:26.380
Since she was discovered and the Man of God laid his hand on her and delivered her.

1:09:26.380,1:09:33.440
she is a changed person and believe me, I have seen a lot of changes in her.

1:09:33.440,1:09:36.380
Now she gets up in the morning and wants to see the family.

1:09:36.380,1:09:39.600
She wants to see us and share with us.

1:09:39.600,1:09:45.460
It has been wonderful. This is really the arena of liberty.

1:09:45.460,1:09:55.200
I want to say, we came here fully prepared to worship here at The SCOAN.

1:09:55.200,1:09:59.840
We had to spend a lot of money for accommodation.

1:09:59.840,1:10:08.300
But we were lodged here by the man of God and fed by him for the past one week

1:10:08.300,1:10:13.300
and we did not pay anything.

1:10:13.300,1:10:20.720
Now we will be leaving Lagos to go back to Cameroon and

1:10:20.720,1:10:27.160
my daughter has been blessed with a sum of 150,000 naira to start a new life

1:10:27.160,1:10:33.400
and a sum of 60,000 naira for us to pay our transportation back home.

1:10:33.400,1:10:41.660
I was sitting with my family, thinking of how to start a new life for my daughter.

1:10:41.660,1:10:47.820
Now the man of God has really blessed us. He has removed that burden from me.

1:10:47.820,1:10:55.040
A piece of advice to the whole world, I am a parent, and other parents also have problems in their homes.

1:10:55.040,1:11:02.140
Believe me, you have to come here to seek the face of the Lord

1:11:02.140,1:11:05.900
because this place is the arena of liberty.

1:11:05.900,1:11:13.540
What we have been crying for the past four years, the man of God has wiped off our tears

1:11:13.540,1:11:20.640
We are going back home happily, and again I would like to say that I have been in Lagos.

1:11:20.640,1:11:25.960
I see that Nigerians don't know what they have here.

1:11:25.960,1:11:30.280
If they don't know what they have, foreigners will take it from them.

1:11:30.280,1:11:34.940
Because this is the real place to come, real place to be.

1:11:34.940,1:11:42.360
I have received calls, from abroad, even from the U.S. where I come from.

1:11:42.360,1:11:45.620
People have seen me here and they are still seeing me here.

1:11:45.620,1:11:49.360
I have received calls.

1:11:49.360,1:11:50.940
To God be the glory.

1:11:50.940,1:11:53.060
Believe me, this is a wonderful place.

1:11:53.060,1:11:54.060
Today is the day

1:11:54.060,1:11:55.080
Amen

1:11:55.080,1:11:56.040
The day of joy

1:11:56.040,1:11:56.860
Amen

1:11:56.860,1:11:58.240
Today is the day
