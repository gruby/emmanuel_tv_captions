Prophet T.B. Joshua's Visit To The Holy Land - Jerusalem & The Sea Of Galilee

0:00:09.140,0:00:15.740
In Matthew 4, Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the Kingdom

0:00:15.740,0:00:20.060
and healing all kinds of sickness and disease among the people.

0:00:20.060,0:00:25.840
After these things, Jesus went out over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.

0:00:25.840,0:00:33.340
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea

0:00:33.340,0:00:34.780
for they were fishermen.

0:00:34.780,0:00:39.060
Then Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men".

0:00:39.060,0:00:41.820
They immediately left their nets and followed him.

0:00:41.820,0:00:48.620
When he had come into Jerusalem in John 21, all the city was moved, saying, "Who is this?"

0:00:48.620,0:00:53.640
So the multitudes said, "This is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth of Galilee".

0:00:53.640,0:01:02.280
And this is Prophet T.B. Joshua's visit to Jerusalem and the Sea of Galilee - a visit to the Holy Land.

Upon hearing of the support of Prophet T.B. Joshua to the nation of Israel, the Israeli Ambassador to Nigeria

0:01:16.660,0:01:20.080
Guy Feldman visited Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:20.080,0:01:49.540
Visit of Israeli Ambassador Guy Feldman & ZAKA's Rabbi Yehuda Zahav To Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:49.540,0:01:55.660
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptised by John in the Jordan.

0:01:55.660,0:02:00.400
And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened

0:02:00.400,0:02:05.400
and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove, and a voice came from Heaven,

0:02:05.400,0:02:12.380
"Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased". In Mark 1: 9-11.

0:02:12.380,0:02:18.880
From this very valley, a call to visit, which is T.B. Joshua.

0:02:18.880,0:02:23.500

0:02:23.500,0:02:25.360

0:09:09.580,0:09:17.100
with Israeli Prime Minister Jitzchak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein.

0:09:17.100,0:09:23.180
Awaiting him is an Israeli TV Station that takes the opportunity to have an exclusive interview

0:09:23.180,0:09:25.540
with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:09:25.540,0:09:33.380
Pastor Joshua, may I ask, you are known as a Prophet; what is your prophecy for this land?

0:09:33.380,0:09:34.980
That is why we are here.

0:09:34.980,0:09:37.200
Are we going to have war or peace?

0:09:37.200,0:09:39.100
No, don't worry, that is why we are here.

0:09:39.100,0:09:40.020
We are here.

0:09:40.020,0:09:43.680
Whatever life brings, I will be here with you.

0:09:43.680,0:09:45.120
So, we are protected now?

0:09:45.120,0:09:46.460
By the grace of God.

0:09:46.460,0:09:52.940
Can you tell us in a few sentences, how did you get your power?

0:09:52.940,0:09:59.040
From my Father, Jesus, who was born in this land.

0:09:59.040,0:10:06.660
I am an inheritance of His grace - the grace of Jesus Christ.

0:10:06.660,0:10:09.660
What was your first prophecy?

0:10:09.660,0:10:13.080
It is not my prophecy; it is God's prophecy.

0:10:13.080,0:10:19.740
You cure people by chasing the devil or demons out of them;

0:10:19.740,0:10:24.440
are demons here also in this land?

0:10:24.440,0:10:30.320
Demons are responsible for the pain, killing, stealing and destruction.

0:10:30.320,0:10:36.660
My purpose of praying for people is to give them relief,

0:10:36.660,0:10:42.140
to separate them from the demons that are responsible for the pain and affliction.
