0:00:00.000,0:00:05.800
Praise the Lord!

0:00:05.800,0:00:06.960
Yes.

0:00:06.960,0:00:10.080
What a God we have to worship!

0:00:10.080,0:00:13.100
What a Son we have to praise!

0:00:13.100,0:00:16.200
What a future lies before us!

0:00:16.200,0:00:19.080
Greet your neighbour. Say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:19.080,0:00:23.020
Greet the next person beside you. Say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:23.020,0:00:27.740
Viewers all over the world, Good Morning!

0:00:27.740,0:00:29.480
Hallelujah!

0:00:29.480,0:00:31.000
You may be seated.

0:00:31.000,0:00:33.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:33.840,0:00:38.280
I want to see joyful faces.

0:00:38.280,0:00:43.000
Camera man, can you give us shots of joyful faces.

0:00:43.000,0:00:46.400
We want to see joyful faces.

0:00:46.400,0:00:49.960
Hallelujah!

0:00:49.960,0:00:51.060
Yes.

0:00:51.060,0:00:53.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:53.160,0:00:58.340
I want to believe that you have done your exercise this morning.

0:00:58.340,0:01:01.360
You have done your exercise this morning?

0:01:01.360,0:01:06.220
You know, exercise does not only mean when you go to the gym

0:01:06.220,0:01:10.740
and you are on your treadmill running or jogging.

0:01:10.740,0:01:14.940
Or maybe you are on your bike cycling.

0:01:14.940,0:01:21.080
You can also take a 10 to 30 minutes walk in a day.

0:01:21.080,0:01:24.540
And whilst you are walking, smile.

0:01:24.540,0:01:31.040
Tell your neighbour, "Make sure you smile".

0:01:31.040,0:01:33.120
What do I mean?

0:01:33.120,0:01:37.900
I mean, when you take a 10 to 30 minutes walk a day,

0:01:37.900,0:01:45.100
always remember the prophetic word of our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:45.100,0:01:53.900
He said: "Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me, give me more of You".

0:01:53.900,0:01:57.860
I mean, whilst you are doing this 10 to 30 minutes walk,

0:01:57.860,0:02:03.420
let this be what you say in your heart.

0:02:03.420,0:02:05.600
Let this be a joyful heart.

0:02:05.600,0:02:12.120
That is what I mean by when you walk, make sure you smile.

0:02:12.120,0:02:15.120
If you have not done your exercise this morning,

0:02:15.120,0:02:23.240
you may probably find yourself restless or sleeping.

0:02:23.240,0:02:29.800
Sometimes, you can find yourself going to the toilet five to six times whilst the service is going on.

0:02:29.800,0:02:36.640
Why? - Because food and water are not rightfully positioned in your body.

0:02:36.640,0:02:40.480
So tell your neighbour once again with a smile,

0:02:40.480,0:02:43.260
"Have a joyful face".

0:02:43.260,0:02:46.040
With a smile in your heart, say to your neighbour,

0:02:46.040,0:02:57.140
"My neighbour, I know that my case is settled today".

0:02:57.140,0:03:00.120
Are you sure?

0:03:00.120,0:03:01.860
[Yes!]

0:03:01.860,0:03:03.500
Yes.

0:03:03.500,0:03:10.480
If indeed you know that your case is settled, then who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

0:03:10.480,0:03:13.180
[Nobody!]

0:03:13.180,0:03:18.920
If indeed you know that your case is settled in Heaven,

0:03:18.920,0:03:23.440
who then shall separate us from the love of Christ?

0:03:23.440,0:03:24.920
Shall persecution?

0:03:24.920,0:03:26.220
[No!]

0:03:26.220,0:03:31.080
Shall tribulation, affliction, poverty?

0:03:31.080,0:03:31.720
[No!]

0:03:31.720,0:03:33.800
Absolutely nothing!

0:03:33.800,0:03:42.060
Let someone say, "Absolutely nothing can separate us from the love of Christ!"

0:03:42.060,0:03:43.620
Hallelujah!

0:03:43.620,0:03:46.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:46.800,0:03:53.780
Brethren, when you look around the world today, you will agree with me

0:03:53.780,0:04:01.320
that our generation is facing uncommon challenges

0:04:01.320,0:04:09.320
and uncommon challenges demand uncommon faith to be saved.

0:04:09.320,0:04:13.320
When you look at what is happening around you,

0:04:13.320,0:04:18.400
when you look at what is happening around the world in general,

0:04:18.400,0:04:27.100
you will agree with me that our generation is facing uncommon challenges

0:04:27.100,0:04:37.040
and uncommon challenges demand uncommon faith to be saved.

0:04:37.040,0:04:47.460
It is important for us to know that in life, we do have days, weeks, months and years

0:04:47.460,0:04:51.700
that come with enormous challenges.

0:04:51.700,0:04:55.200
They are inevitable.

0:04:55.200,0:05:07.160
It is the time and season when God wants us to learn the important and crucial lessons of life;

0:05:07.160,0:05:17.760
as such, they are unchangeable events because they are predestined to prepare us,

0:05:17.760,0:05:22.700
to strengthen our desire for Christ.

0:05:22.700,0:05:31.420
When they come, how best do you handle them?

0:05:31.420,0:05:45.360
When they come, as Christians, how best do you handle those periods?

0:05:45.360,0:05:58.060
Majority of us are spiritually blind, spiritually dull - dull in understanding,

0:05:58.060,0:06:06.560
with the unseen realm absolutely closed to our spiritual vision.

0:06:06.560,0:06:18.440
We can only see the outward effects of satan's actions but we are blind to our spiritual course.

0:06:18.440,0:06:24.400
We can only see something happening but we don't know the cause.

0:06:24.400,0:06:39.160
God oftentimes uses foolish things to prepare us,

0:06:39.160,0:06:44.560
to strengthen our desire and determination for Him,

0:06:44.560,0:06:52.060
to stop us awhile and rearrange us for the future.

0:06:52.060,0:06:55.800
Whatever difficulties that you are facing,

0:06:55.800,0:07:00.800
whatever challenges that you may be passing through,

0:07:00.800,0:07:06.780
be assured that it is not your challenges that make you fall

0:07:06.780,0:07:13.280
but your response and your reaction to them.

0:07:13.280,0:07:20.200
It is not your challenges that make you fall or fail in life

0:07:20.200,0:07:27.500
but your response and your reaction to them.

0:07:27.500,0:07:38.080
While some of us yield to pressure and make wrong decisions,

0:07:38.080,0:07:45.180
others face the same challenges but make the right decisions.

0:07:45.180,0:07:57.000
Always remember that broken focus is the real reason why men fail today.

0:07:57.000,0:08:00.740
Whatever challenges that you are going through,

0:08:00.740,0:08:11.580
it is not your challenges that make you fall but your response and your reaction to them.

0:08:11.580,0:08:19.220
While some of us yield to pressure and make wrong decisions.

0:08:19.220,0:08:28.640
Others faced the same pressures, the same tests and trials but made the right decision.

0:08:28.640,0:08:36.360
Always remember that broken focus is the reason why people fail.

0:08:36.360,0:08:47.360
Regardless of your situation, choose today to let the One who created you assist you in all you do.

0:08:47.360,0:08:52.560
I don't know the situation you are going through but I know Jesus knows.

0:08:52.560,0:08:55.720
Whatever might be your challenges, brethren,

0:08:55.720,0:09:03.580
choose today to let the One who created you assist you.

0:09:03.580,0:09:10.160
Do not allow your bad experience to limit you.

0:09:10.160,0:09:15.000
Do not allow your bad experience to wipe you out.

0:09:15.000,0:09:20.900
Why don't you turn your scars into stars?

0:09:20.900,0:09:26.980
Why don't you turn your mess into a message?

0:09:26.980,0:09:32.620
Why don't you turn your tests into a testimony?

0:09:32.620,0:09:45.660
Tell your neighbour, "No matter my situation, I will turn my scars into stars".

0:09:45.660,0:09:52.420
I will turn my scars into stars.

0:09:52.420,0:10:00.960
A Christian is known by his ability to face situations and circumstances.

0:10:00.960,0:10:03.920
I believe I'm talking to God's people.

0:10:03.920,0:10:09.860
I believe if you're not, before the end of this message, you will be one, in Jesus' name.

0:10:09.860,0:10:22.080
Viewers all over the world, a Christian is known by his ability to face situations and circumstances.

0:10:22.080,0:10:32.020
Those who see beyond their challenges, those who see beyond their situations,

0:10:32.020,0:10:41.040
do not despair in the face of their seeming setbacks.

0:10:41.040,0:10:55.400
But today we oftentimes run away from the very thing that brings strength into our lives.

0:10:55.400,0:11:05.700
Today we oftentimes dodge situations that bring strength into our lives.

0:11:05.700,0:11:14.040
Tell your neighbour, "Turn your scars into stars".

0:11:14.040,0:11:20.900
Let's quickly open our Bible to the Book of Romans and that will be our proof text.

0:11:20.900,0:11:29.500
The Book of Romans - let's take it from chapter 8.

0:11:29.500,0:11:36.660
The Book of Romans - after the Book of Acts.

0:11:36.660,0:11:43.220
Just before the Book of 1 Corinthians.

0:11:43.220,0:11:47.340
The Book of Romans, chapter 8.

0:11:47.340,0:11:50.940
Let's take our reading from verse 1.

0:11:50.940,0:11:52.940
Are you there?

0:11:52.940,0:11:56.540
SCRIPTURE REFERENCE
Romans 8:1

0:11:56.540,0:12:04.540
"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,

0:12:04.540,0:12:11.260
who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."

0:12:11.260,0:12:17.860
Who do not walk according to what is seen but according to what is unseen.

0:12:17.860,0:12:24.660
Who do not walk according to senses but according to faith.

0:12:24.660,0:12:26.760
I take that verse 1 again.

0:12:26.760,0:12:33.700
"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,

0:12:33.700,0:12:40.040
who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."

0:12:40.040,0:12:56.480
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death."

0:12:56.480,0:12:58.580
Let's go to verse 31.

0:12:58.580,0:13:01.480
"What then shall we say to these things?"

0:13:01.480,0:13:03.300
Are you there?

0:13:03.300,0:13:09.040
"If God is for us, who can be against us?

0:13:09.040,0:13:15.000
He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,

0:13:15.000,0:13:22.720
how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?

0:13:22.720,0:13:29.940
Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.

0:13:29.940,0:13:37.400
Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen,

0:13:37.400,0:13:46.760
who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."

0:13:46.760,0:13:48.300
Verse 35.

0:13:48.300,0:13:51.540
"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

0:13:51.540,0:14:04.620
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

0:14:04.620,0:14:11.340
As it is written: 'For Your sake we are killed all day long.

0:14:11.340,0:14:14.440
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'

0:14:14.440,0:14:22.920
Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.

0:14:22.920,0:14:31.260
For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers,

0:14:31.260,0:14:34.500
nor things present nor things to come,

0:14:34.500,0:14:39.180
nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing,

0:14:39.180,0:14:47.760
shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

0:14:47.760,0:14:53.700
Let someone say, "Amen!"

0:14:53.700,0:14:57.800
Tell your neighbour, "Turn your scars into stars".

0:14:57.800,0:15:06.140
No matter the situation you may be facing, turn them into stars.

0:15:06.140,0:15:14.760
Throughout history, the lives of the heroes of faith have proved

0:15:14.760,0:15:24.180
that we are created to live for God's design and not by default.

0:15:24.180,0:15:30.340
When you read your Bible from Genesis to Revelation, you will agree with me

0:15:30.340,0:15:41.820
that the lives of the heroes of faith have proved that we are to live

0:15:41.820,0:15:49.380
for God's design and not by default.

0:15:49.380,0:15:57.560
Remember there are two sides to a coin, just as there are two dimensions to life.

0:15:57.560,0:16:04.180
And as the saying goes, "No wounds, no pearls" -

0:16:04.180,0:16:08.180
there can be no promotion without a test.

0:16:08.180,0:16:17.160
I believe we all want promotion but you must be ready to go through some little challenges.

0:16:17.160,0:16:23.340
There can be no success without failure.

0:16:23.340,0:16:30.780
Brethren, there can be no promotion without a test.

0:16:30.780,0:16:37.780
There can be no strengths without weaknesses.

0:16:37.780,0:16:43.560
There can be no good health without sickness

0:16:43.560,0:16:48.460
and there can be no victory without war.

0:16:48.460,0:16:56.760
The war I am talking about is not a physical combat but a spiritual warfare

0:16:56.760,0:17:04.580
where only a God-focused, I mean a serious-minded person, will be victorious.

0:17:04.580,0:17:13.880
Only a God-focused, serious-minded person will be victorious.

0:17:13.880,0:17:25.780
If you believe you are going to walk on a red carpet to get there, you are wrong.

0:17:25.780,0:17:30.500
Brethren, if you believe you are going to walk on a red carpet -

0:17:30.500,0:17:37.160
nothing poking you, nothing distracting you - then you are wrong.

0:17:37.160,0:17:44.880
Those unpleasant situations that you are going through right now

0:17:44.880,0:17:49.780
are part of your journey to success.

0:17:49.780,0:18:05.320
Those foolish things are part of your journey to success.

0:18:05.320,0:18:14.160
Today, many have changed the course of their lives

0:18:14.160,0:18:24.120
through their inability to see beyond their immediate setbacks, their immediate stops.

0:18:24.120,0:18:27.900
Many marriages have collapsed,

0:18:27.900,0:18:30.940
many relationships today have collapsed

0:18:30.940,0:18:41.020
because of people's inability to see beyond their temporary setbacks, temporary challenges.

0:18:41.020,0:18:49.280
Many have changed businesses because they could not see beyond their setbacks.

0:18:49.280,0:18:56.360
Ask any successful businessperson, any successful couple,

0:18:56.360,0:19:03.400
they will tell you stories of their setbacks and comebacks.

0:19:03.400,0:19:07.400
Ask any successful person, any successful couple,

0:19:07.400,0:19:14.160
they will tell you stories of their setbacks and comebacks.

0:19:14.160,0:19:24.920
I want you to know that the beginner is not the owner but the finisher.

0:19:24.920,0:19:36.720
Finishers are those who always exercise great faith under great trials and persecution.

0:19:36.720,0:19:37.840
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:37.840,0:19:55.140
Finishers are those who always exercise great faith under great trials and persecution.

0:19:55.140,0:20:02.920
Whatever situation you may be facing, remember the Book of 1 Corinthians 10:13.

0:20:02.920,0:20:11.260
It says no temptation has seized us except what is common to man.

0:20:11.260,0:20:15.140
Sometimes, today when we are faced with situations

0:20:15.140,0:20:20.140
that look like temporary stops, temporary setbacks,

0:20:20.140,0:20:28.700
we easily make wrong steps, we easily make wrong judgements,

0:20:28.700,0:20:32.660
we easily make negative reactions,

0:20:32.660,0:20:37.860
we easily make negative choices

0:20:37.860,0:20:44.200
instead of examining our lives in the light of God's Word.

0:20:44.200,0:20:47.780
Sometimes we love to move faster than our shadow

0:20:47.780,0:20:51.440
and that is why most of the time we make mistakes;

0:20:51.440,0:20:59.080
we regret some of the decisions that we make in life.

0:20:59.080,0:21:05.680
Sometimes when we are faced with situations that look like temporary setbacks,

0:21:05.680,0:21:09.380
we easily overreact.

0:21:09.380,0:21:19.280
We easily behave negatively instead of examining our lives in the light of God's Word.

0:21:19.280,0:21:21.920
We want to move faster than our shadow

0:21:21.920,0:21:29.920
and that is why we oftentimes regret some of the decisions that we took.

0:21:29.920,0:21:39.480
As Christians, our challenges force us to look deep enough,

0:21:39.480,0:21:46.440
to explore possibilities, to draw closer to God,

0:21:46.440,0:21:58.640
to dream of other ways that we might have ignored when tests and trials come.

0:21:58.640,0:22:09.340
There is always a lesson to be learnt.

0:22:09.340,0:22:14.240
Many don't want to learn those lessons; we want to move ahead of our future,

0:22:14.240,0:22:16.920
ahead of our shadow.

0:22:16.920,0:22:19.820
That is why the Bible tells us in the Book of 1 Corinthians

0:22:19.820,0:22:27.480
that no temptation has seized us except what is common to man, for the Lord is faithful.

0:22:27.480,0:22:32.140
He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear.

0:22:32.140,0:22:39.120
And when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out for us so that we can overcome.

0:22:39.120,0:22:42.460
Remember Jesus will not run the race for us,

0:22:42.460,0:22:52.000
but He promised to strengthen our minds against storms, thorns, snakes and scorpions

0:22:52.000,0:22:59.140
on our road to success.

0:22:59.140,0:23:06.880
You ask Peter in the Book of Luke 5 and he will tell you

0:23:06.880,0:23:13.840
that what we see as failure is not failure at all, from eternity's perspective,

0:23:13.840,0:23:17.580
from God's point of view.

0:23:17.580,0:23:22.660
What we see as rejection, what we see as setback

0:23:22.660,0:23:29.700
is not from eternity's perspective, from God's point of view.

0:23:29.700,0:23:38.080
We serve a God who oftentimes uses foolish things to confound the wise.

0:23:38.080,0:23:44.100
The unpleasant situation you are going through right now is so foolish.

0:23:44.100,0:23:54.200
God oftentimes uses foolish things to confound the wise.

0:23:54.200,0:24:00.880
Brethren, to the wise, disappointment is a foolish thing

0:24:00.880,0:24:07.760
but God oftentimes uses disappointment to preserve us for redemption.

0:24:07.760,0:24:13.180
Poverty, to the wise, is a foolish thing

0:24:13.180,0:24:23.420
but God oftentimes uses poverty to prevent us from death.

0:24:23.420,0:24:27.980
Rejection, to the wise, is a foolish thing

0:24:27.980,0:24:38.320
but God oftentimes uses rejection to prepare us for a new level in life.

0:24:38.320,0:24:44.520
Tell your neighbour, "My situation may look like a setback,

0:24:44.520,0:24:48.820
my situation may look like a stop,

0:24:48.820,0:24:55.700
it may look like a delay but it is not".

0:24:55.700,0:25:01.600
In any case, delay is not a denial.

0:25:01.600,0:25:07.720
Delay is not a denial.

0:25:07.720,0:25:17.500
When you are faced with a situation that looks like a setback, stay focused.

0:25:17.500,0:25:24.520
Maintain a balanced frame of mind,

0:25:24.520,0:25:32.520
dig deep and fight it through.

0:25:32.520,0:25:40.640
It takes faith to realise that our situation is a mere stopping interval,

0:25:40.640,0:25:43.980
a break between two events.

0:25:43.980,0:25:51.360
Therefore, when your situation gets hotter, you are getting closer to your breakthrough.

0:25:51.360,0:25:53.760
Let someone say, "I'm getting closer".

0:25:53.760,0:25:56.480
"I have no doubt I'm getting closer."

0:25:56.480,0:26:04.320
"I have no doubt I'm getting closer to my breakthrough, to my healing, to my deliverance,

0:26:04.320,0:26:06.800
to all of God's blessings in my life."

0:26:06.800,0:26:11.620
If you believe that, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus!

0:26:11.620,0:26:17.520
There is no doubt we are getting closer to our breakthrough.

0:26:17.520,0:26:31.200
We need experience to maintain greatness.

0:26:31.200,0:26:34.920
What is your situation?

0:26:34.920,0:26:43.180
Is it an inability to get a job in spite of your qualifications?

0:26:43.180,0:26:51.660
Is it lateness in marriage in spite of your prayers and fasting?

0:26:51.660,0:27:00.640
Is it hatred or rejection in spite of your hard work?

0:27:00.640,0:27:10.960
Is it health challenges that seem not to be yielding to your prayer?

0:27:10.960,0:27:23.460
Always remember that events that seem ordinary may have extraordinary effects in the spirit,

0:27:23.460,0:27:29.660
much of which is hidden from the ordinary mind.

0:27:29.660,0:27:34.980
Always remember when you face situations and you don't know what is happening,

0:27:34.980,0:27:46.020
always remember that events that seem ordinary may have extraordinary effects in the spirit,

0:27:46.020,0:27:51.760
much of which is hidden from the ordinary mind.

0:27:51.760,0:27:54.820
But it takes a reflective mind

0:27:54.820,0:28:03.540
to realise that behind our situation lies the promise of God for our lives.

0:28:03.540,0:28:09.360
It takes faith.

0:28:09.360,0:28:15.320
In the Book of Daniel 6 - we all know the story of Daniel -

0:28:15.320,0:28:17.740
when the decree was published, the Bible says that

0:28:17.740,0:28:27.640
Daniel knew that nothing beautiful, nothing giant and huge could be created

0:28:27.640,0:28:34.920
without a measure of toil, a measure of pain.

0:28:34.920,0:28:45.800
He knew if the human sympathy of King Darius had saved him from the sad part of his life

0:28:45.800,0:28:50.360
when he was sent to the lion's den,

0:28:50.360,0:28:56.720
the glorious part that followed would have been lost.

0:28:56.720,0:28:59.000
In the face of life's threat,

0:28:59.000,0:29:03.900
the Bible says that he maintained a balanced frame of mind

0:29:03.900,0:29:10.240
and he turned his scars into stars.

0:29:10.240,0:29:21.180
Brethren, if human sympathy could save you, you would have been saved a long time ago.

0:29:21.180,0:29:28.200
If human sympathy - money, wealth, position, popularity, fame - could save you,

0:29:28.200,0:29:33.840
you would have been saved a long time ago.

0:29:33.840,0:29:38.720
Sometimes when we are faced with situations, we begin to seek alternatives,

0:29:38.720,0:29:45.060
we begin to seek human sympathy to save us, to help us.

0:29:45.060,0:29:53.800
We begin to seek shortcuts, alternatives in an attempt to escape from reality.

0:29:53.800,0:29:56.040
It does not take long to realise

0:29:56.040,0:30:09.420
that shortcuts and alternatives have their own way of disappointing one.

0:30:09.420,0:30:14.480
If you cry to human beings for help, you will receive human sympathy

0:30:14.480,0:30:19.820
but that will not solve your problem.

0:30:19.820,0:30:28.740
It is only Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our faith, that can solve it -

0:30:28.740,0:30:37.320
the One who has no beginning and He has no end.

0:30:37.320,0:30:43.040
Brethren, greatness begins with wounds.

0:30:43.040,0:30:46.160
When you accept your adversity,

0:30:46.160,0:30:52.960
the Bible says when we endure every pain, we will learn what we need to know

0:30:52.960,0:30:57.160
and our grief will turn to gain.

0:30:57.160,0:31:10.460
Tell your neighbour, "No matter my situation, I know He will turn my scars into stars".

0:31:10.460,0:31:23.960
Finally, brethren, let the Book of 1 Corinthians 9:24-25 encourage you.

0:31:23.960,0:31:34.660
When you run, run in such a way as to obtain the prize.

0:31:34.660,0:31:43.680
All of us who are falling made a decision

0:31:43.680,0:31:51.640
but all of us who have not fallen faced similar temptations

0:31:51.640,0:31:56.460
but made a different decision.

0:31:56.460,0:32:01.800
At one point in our lives we all feel like giving up.

0:32:01.800,0:32:13.280
We all feel at one point in our lives when we are faced with situations, we all feel like giving up.

0:32:13.280,0:32:19.260
You might be asking yourself, "Why do I have to go through trials?"

0:32:19.260,0:32:24.140
"Why do I have to go through all this pain, shame, embarrassment,

0:32:24.140,0:32:30.660
rejection, name-calling, persecution, poverty?"

0:32:30.660,0:32:32.660
Yes.

0:32:32.660,0:32:38.260
It is because Somebody wants to turn turn your test into a testimony.

0:32:38.260,0:32:44.680
I tell you: Somebody wants to turn turn your test into a testimony.

0:32:44.680,0:32:52.320
It is because Somebody wants to turn your poverty into prosperity, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:32:52.320,0:33:00.360
It is because Somebody wants to turn your frustration, your failure into fruitfulness,

0:33:00.360,0:33:05.200
in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:33:05.200,0:33:12.620
Who knows what would have become of you if those temporary setbacks,

0:33:12.620,0:33:19.140
if those temporary stops, had not come at intervals?

0:33:19.140,0:33:23.140
Who knows where we would be today?

0:33:23.140,0:33:35.400
But with deep reflection, you will know that there is a purpose of God behind your situations.

0:33:35.400,0:33:45.700
Brethren, this is encouragement to the timid soul like me.

0:33:45.700,0:33:52.280
Are you doing today what you ought to have done earlier in life?

0:33:52.280,0:34:00.580
Brethren, are you facing today what you ought to have done earlier in life?

0:34:00.580,0:34:08.100
With proper reflection, you will know that your case is not that of failure

0:34:08.100,0:34:17.080
but a refusal to do what you ought to have done earlier in life.

0:34:17.080,0:34:31.120
Never forget that patience, perseverance, endurance, humility pay off at last.

0:34:31.120,0:34:44.760
Perseverance, endurance, obedience, faithfulness pay off at last.

0:34:44.760,0:34:53.200
Do not allow your circumstances to rob you, to limit you.

0:34:53.200,0:35:02.000
Let the One who created you assist you today

0:35:02.000,0:35:07.300
and turn your scars into stars.

0:35:07.300,0:35:15.840
If you make the Word of God your rule and the grace of God your principle,

0:35:15.840,0:35:20.460
victory is yours, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:35:20.460,0:35:25.260
Victory is yours, in the Blood of Jesus Christ!

0:35:25.260,0:35:30.940
May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of our heart, in Jesus' name.

0:35:30.940,0:35:33.820
Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus,

0:35:33.820,0:35:40.640
for turning my scars into stars, no matter my situation.

0:35:40.640,0:35:48.680
Thank You for turning my scars into stars, in Jesus' name!"
