0:00:00.000,0:00:04.820
Here is Chinazo, attached to a breathing machine that she is dependent on for her ailment.

0:00:04.820,0:00:09.520
Displayed on the table in front of her is the medication she has to take daily.

0:00:09.520,0:00:14.560
Her mother cries out to the man of God, for God to locate her daughter.

0:00:14.560,0:00:18.880
Man of God, please, help my daughter! We are from South Africa.

0:00:18.880,0:00:26.160
She has got a problem in breathing because of asthma and allergic rhinitis.

0:00:26.160,0:00:29.420
She has been having this for four years.

0:00:29.420,0:00:36.400
Every time the weather changes, she gets a blockage in her chest and breathing.

0:00:36.400,0:00:42.360
She has to take medication every day. She cannot go out without taking medication.

0:00:42.360,0:00:48.580
Most of the time, she goes to casualty so that she can get oxygen.

0:00:48.580,0:00:53.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:53.160,0:01:00.240
It has affected her in the way that every time she is sick, she can't go to school.

0:01:00.240,0:01:07.100
She cannot go out and visit because we need to make sure that we give her medication all the time.

0:01:07.100,0:01:10.440
When she goes out to visit, she can't sleep over.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
And Healing In Jesus' Name

0:01:25.400,0:01:27.720
My name is Chi Chi.

0:01:27.720,0:01:29.440
Oh, how are you?

0:01:29.440,0:01:30.480
I'm fine.

0:01:30.480,0:01:34.080
Jesus loves you so much.

0:01:34.080,0:01:40.360
Please, heal me! I've had enough of this medication.

0:01:40.360,0:01:46.540
I want to be healed, in Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

0:01:46.540,0:01:49.140

0:01:49.140,0:01:53.700
Listen to what my little one says. You said what?

0:01:53.700,0:01:56.920
Please, heal me!

0:01:56.920,0:01:59.180
Jesus will heal you. He loves you so much.

0:01:59.180,0:02:02.700
He is concerned about you.

0:02:02.700,0:02:06.180
He is concerned about your health.

0:02:06.180,0:02:11.060
Jesus is concerned about your health - how you are doing.

0:02:11.060,0:02:14.960
He does not want you to have asthma.

0:02:14.960,0:02:19.960
He loves you so much.

0:02:19.960,0:02:26.300
Yes, I love Him too.

0:02:26.300,0:02:29.040
You love Him too?

0:02:29.040,0:02:34.680
Please, heal me! I am begging you, please, heal me!

0:02:34.680,0:02:36.640
I don't want this medication.

0:02:36.640,0:02:40.400
I want to be healed, in Jesus' name we have prayed.

0:03:40.780,0:03:43.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:43.080,0:03:45.340
She said she wants to speak to me.

0:03:45.340,0:03:48.480
She doesn't want anybody to know.

0:03:48.480,0:03:50.320
So, I just said, "Ok".

0:03:50.320,0:03:53.640
I will not tell you because she said nobody should know.

0:03:53.640,0:03:57.760
So when I leave here, I will see you. I understand. Okay?

0:03:57.760,0:04:00.660
I will see you. Okay? Thank you.

0:04:00.660,0:04:05.080
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:04:05.080,0:04:10.120
Thank You, Jesus! I am free, in the name of Jesus! Thank You!

Healed In Jesus' Name

0:04:14.240,0:04:19.660
I can breathe again, in the name of Jesus!

TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:04:23.900,0:04:27.540
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:27.540,0:04:31.940
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:31.940,0:04:35.620
It is good to be in the presence of the Lord.

0:04:35.620,0:04:39.160
My name is Mbali Ibe.

0:04:39.160,0:04:41.460
This is my daughter Chinazo.

0:04:41.460,0:04:49.580
My older daughter and my darling husband Vitalis.

0:04:49.580,0:04:56.980
We came to The SCOAN because of the problem she was experiencing.

0:04:56.980,0:05:05.380
She had a problem of short breath, allergic rhinitis due to asthma.

0:05:05.380,0:05:11.580
It was so bad, in such a way that in many cases,

0:05:11.580,0:05:18.400
we would have to take her to casualty at least twice or three times a week.

0:05:18.400,0:05:23.200
When she went to school, she had to play in a certain area.

0:05:23.200,0:05:27.840
She couldn't play with everybody else because when she played

0:05:27.840,0:05:33.200
where there was dust or grass, it was a problem.

0:05:33.200,0:05:40.220
As a normal child, a child should be left to play and run anywhere they please to.

0:05:40.220,0:05:43.680
But with her, it was a different story.

0:05:43.680,0:05:47.720
She would play because you could not stop her from playing with other children.

0:05:47.720,0:05:51.820
But at the end of the day, it would be a problem.

0:05:51.820,0:05:57.880
When we gave her medication, it would relieve her for a while.

0:05:57.880,0:06:03.560
After that, we would have to take her to see a doctor or casualty.

0:06:03.560,0:06:08.360
They would always change medication for her; they would always give her different drugs.

0:06:08.360,0:06:12.320
They would always give her stronger medication.

0:06:12.320,0:06:18.560
But I give all the glory to God because today, she is no longer the same.

0:06:18.560,0:06:20.680
She is healed.

0:06:20.680,0:06:26.240
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:26.240,0:06:33.140
So, we saw the documentary and we can see all the table full of the medication and the machine.

0:06:33.140,0:06:35.440
Just to give us a clearer picture.

0:06:35.440,0:06:39.840
Tell us - how often did she use all these things?

0:06:39.840,0:06:44.860
The medication that you see here is half of what she took.

0:06:44.860,0:06:50.220
She had to take her medication every day - three times a day.

0:06:50.220,0:06:53.820
Seven days a week, three times a day.

0:06:53.820,0:07:02.700
If she missed one of the pumps, tablets or sirups, then she would not sleep that night.

0:07:02.700,0:07:07.120
So she could not live without taking medication

0:07:07.120,0:07:10.260
She was dependent on this medication.

0:07:10.260,0:07:15.320
When she went to school, you would have to make sure you did not forget to give her medication.

0:07:15.320,0:07:20.260
When she came back from school, you would make sure she took medication.

0:07:20.260,0:07:24.300
So she was basically dependent on this medication.

0:07:24.300,0:07:27.720
She could not do without medication before.

0:07:27.720,0:07:31.780
Wow. And without all of this, there was nothing else the doctors could do

0:07:31.780,0:07:35.780
about this condition of asthma and rhinitis?

0:07:35.780,0:07:40.420
We had been to different doctors and specialists.

0:07:40.420,0:07:45.760
They told us that asthma is not curable.

0:07:45.760,0:07:49.520
The only thing they could do for her is to treat it.

0:07:49.520,0:07:52.080
They would just give her treatment.

0:07:52.080,0:07:54.940
When she grew older, she might outgrow it.

0:07:54.940,0:07:58.900
They couldn't tell us when but they were not sure if she could outgrow it.

0:07:58.900,0:08:04.280
But they said, in many instances, children outgrow it when they are older.

0:08:04.280,0:08:08.400
So she was supposed to take this medication until that time came,

0:08:08.400,0:08:11.080
if it was going to come.

0:08:11.080,0:08:14.680
Wow. So you came here last week to The SCOAN

0:08:14.680,0:08:19.280
and we saw the touching clip of how the man of God prayed for your daughter and family.

0:08:19.280,0:08:23.780
Tell us - what happened and what has been happening since then?

0:08:23.780,0:08:29.960
When we came here on Sunday, by the grace of God, the man of God located us

0:08:29.960,0:08:32.480
and she was prayed for.

0:08:32.480,0:08:41.540
Since that day, we have never experienced any cough, shortage of breath

0:08:41.540,0:08:45.920
or anything like that that we used to experience before.

0:08:45.920,0:08:49.540
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus, the King of Glory!

0:08:49.540,0:08:51.540
Louder and louder!

0:08:51.540,0:08:56.100
Miss Chinazo Ibe & Family
Healing Testimony

0:08:56.100,0:09:02.520
So since then, she has not used the machine, any of the breathing equipment or any of the medication

0:09:02.520,0:09:06.300
that she previously had to use several times every day, is that right?

0:09:06.300,0:09:12.660
Yes, we have never touched that medication ever since that Sunday.

0:09:12.660,0:09:14.920
We have never used the machine.

0:09:14.920,0:09:17.860
And we are never going to use them ever again.

0:09:17.860,0:09:21.660
Amen! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:09:21.660,0:09:27.420
Miss Chinazo Ibe & Family
Healing Testimony

0:09:27.420,0:09:39.480
I think, as a mother, when your little one is sick or is experiencing such attacks,

0:09:39.480,0:09:44.200
in many cases, it is difficult for you to sleep.

0:09:44.200,0:09:50.100
It is difficult for you to ask people to take her for checkups.

0:09:50.100,0:09:57.220
It will affect the whole family because everything that depends on her health,

0:09:57.220,0:10:02.700
it has to be done by you or the father.

0:10:02.700,0:10:08.740
So, in many instances, you will find that instead of going to work or doing your business,

0:10:08.740,0:10:11.440
you cannot because you have to look after her

0:10:11.440,0:10:16.580
or take her for checkups as she has to see one specialist or the other.

0:10:16.580,0:10:20.320
She could not go to school. She had to stay home.

0:10:20.320,0:10:24.460
It is very painful to see your child living like that.

0:10:24.460,0:10:26.520
It is not a good feeling.

0:10:26.520,0:10:32.660
I thank God and give Him the glory that now, the situation has changed.

0:10:32.660,0:10:35.680
Financially, it will affect you.

0:10:35.680,0:10:43.500
You will feel it because if you buy one pump like this -

0:10:43.500,0:10:46.900
people who come from my country will know -

0:10:46.900,0:10:50.600
if you buy a pump like this because if you go to a private doctor,

0:10:50.600,0:10:54.500
they will give you a prescription and you will go and buy this medication on your own.

0:10:54.500,0:10:59.900
A pump like this is about 650 rands - that is for one pump.

0:10:59.900,0:11:06.100
Monthly, you would have to make a budget of about 2000 to 3000 rands for medication

0:11:06.100,0:11:10.540
because she could not stay without medication. You had to make sure she got the medication.

0:11:10.540,0:11:13.000
So we had to make a budget for it.

0:11:13.000,0:11:18.000
So it would affect you as  you could not do certain things for them.

0:11:18.000,0:11:24.320
When it came to their school fees, you had to make sure you provided for her medication

0:11:24.320,0:11:28.680
and school fees but financially, it was a burden to us.

0:11:28.680,0:11:37.240
And ever since the man of God prayed for your daughter, tell us your testimony.

0:11:37.240,0:11:39.240
I'm overjoyed.

0:11:39.240,0:11:50.060
I don't know where to start because my scars have been turned into stars.

0:11:50.060,0:11:55.420
Since from that Sunday, I cannot express how I'm feeling.

0:11:55.420,0:12:03.600
If I could open my heart for you to know how joyful it is, how grateful we are,

0:12:03.600,0:12:12.840
how God has shown us that He is love, I'm grateful, I'm happy, I give all the glory to God.

0:12:12.840,0:12:19.960
With this testimony, I know that we will come back with bigger testimonies!

0:12:19.960,0:12:27.060
Amen! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ, the Miracle Worker!

0:12:27.060,0:12:31.960
Madam, before we move on, we would like to hear - we are so touched by your testimony -

0:12:31.960,0:12:35.460
what is your word of advice to people watching you around the world

0:12:35.460,0:12:43.100
whose daughter or child might go through a similar difficult sickness or hard problems?

0:12:43.100,0:12:48.840
My advice to everybody is:

0:12:48.840,0:12:59.400
Jesus Chris,t by His resurrection, has shown us that He is worthy of our faith.

0:12:59.400,0:13:04.620
He has shown us that we can depend on Him and Him alone.

0:13:04.620,0:13:12.640
He has shown us that He wants to dwell in our hearts and be the Landlord of our hearts.

0:13:12.640,0:13:20.300
Because the prayers I have been praying, this one, when we came here to The SCOAN,

0:13:20.300,0:13:26.940
I said, "God, take more of me and give me more of You".

0:13:26.940,0:13:31.720
I thanked Him for her healing before we even stepped into this church

0:13:31.720,0:13:38.440
because I knew that once we got in here - this vicinity because this is the holy ground -

0:13:38.440,0:13:40.440
everything would be over.

0:13:40.440,0:13:45.120
Now, the problem that we have as Christians:

0:13:45.120,0:13:51.360
We want to believe that when the evangelist or the man of God did not see you,

0:13:51.360,0:13:53.640
you are not okay.

0:13:53.640,0:14:01.160
Believe before you even come inside this church that your problems are over.

0:14:01.160,0:14:06.720
Because God looks at your heart and surely, the man of God will locate you

0:14:06.720,0:14:11.760
when you open your heart with faith,

0:14:11.760,0:14:15.040
when you believe that you have received already.

0:14:15.040,0:14:16.480
Thank You, Jesus!

0:14:16.480,0:14:18.800
"Thank You, Jesus!" is a response from a happy heart.

0:14:18.800,0:14:22.380
Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:14:22.380,0:14:29.220
Truly, who else is worthy of our applause, thanks, praise and lifetime.

0:14:29.220,0:14:32.440
It is none other than Jesus Christ, the King of Glory.

0:14:32.440,0:14:38.560
Now, we would like to hear a word from Chi Chi herself, now that she has received this miracle.

0:14:38.560,0:14:42.600
Our sister, tell us - what is your name and how old are you?

0:14:42.600,0:14:45.440
I'm five years old.

0:14:45.440,0:14:47.600
Wow. And what is your name?

0:14:47.600,0:14:49.180
Chinazo.

0:14:49.180,0:14:51.500
And where are you from?

0:14:51.500,0:14:53.340
From South Africa.

0:14:53.340,0:14:57.980
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for her!

0:14:57.980,0:15:02.480
So, last week, we saw you telling Prophet T.B. Joshua something.

0:15:02.480,0:15:05.220
Can you tell us - what did you tell him?

0:15:05.220,0:15:10.380
I said, "Please, T.B. Joshua, heal me!

0:15:10.380,0:15:16.480
Please heal me!"

0:15:16.480,0:15:20.160
And what did you say about all this medication that you have been using?

0:15:20.160,0:15:23.840
I said, "I have enough of this medication.

0:15:23.840,0:15:28.040
Please heal me! I had enough of this medication.

0:15:28.040,0:15:33.060
Jesus Christus, please heal me! I forgive You. Amen".

0:15:33.060,0:15:38.900
Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:38.900,0:15:43.480
Can you tell us - how did you feel when you were discussing with the man of God

0:15:43.480,0:15:45.640
and when he prayed for you?

0:15:45.640,0:15:52.100
I was shaking but the man of God prayed for me and now I'm healed.

0:15:52.100,0:15:58.180
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:15:58.180,0:16:03.660
So, if you were to see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, now, physically,

0:16:03.660,0:16:06.140
what would you do and what would you say?

0:16:06.140,0:16:09.260
I'm no longer taking medication, I'm no longer coughing,

0:16:09.260,0:16:13.220
I'm no longer bleeding and I'm no longer sneezing.

0:16:13.220,0:16:16.040
Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!

0:16:16.040,0:16:17.080
Thank you!

0:16:17.080,0:16:24.780
Go on! Put your hands together and encourage her!

0:16:24.780,0:16:28.040
Hallelujah! We are listening to this wonderful testimony of Chi Chi

0:16:28.040,0:16:30.420
who came all the way from South Africa

0:16:30.420,0:16:33.420
who received prayer last week from Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:16:33.420,0:16:37.800
and was healed from the problem of allergic rhinitis and asthma

0:16:37.800,0:16:40.620
which she had suffered from for the past four years.

0:16:40.620,0:16:44.920
We have seen the medication, the machines and what she had been dependent on.

0:16:44.920,0:16:49.280
Every day of her life, she had to use these things several times a day

0:16:49.280,0:16:52.900
in order just to survive. Otherwise, she would get shortness of breath,

0:16:52.900,0:16:57.620
she would be coughing and ultimately, her breathing would seize until she was treated

0:16:57.620,0:17:03.280
and even at times rushed to casualty, to the emergency rooms of hospitals to receive oxygen.

0:17:03.280,0:17:05.900
So she is here in our midst today and she is testifying

0:17:05.900,0:17:11.200
how God Almighty has completely healed her from this horrible problem in her life

0:17:11.200,0:17:16.180
and we thank God Almighty that she is here today - a living testimony for the glory of God.

0:17:16.180,0:17:18.660
We want to ask you a question now.

0:17:18.660,0:17:23.580
Can you tell us - if you were to see T.B. Joshua standing in front of you now,

0:17:23.580,0:17:26.740
what would you say to him and what would you do?

0:17:26.740,0:17:34.100
I would just say, "I'm no longer coughing! Thank You, Jesus!

0:17:34.100,0:17:37.500
I'm no longer sneezing, I'm no longer bleeding,

0:17:37.500,0:17:42.880
I'm no longer taking medication!

0:17:42.880,0:17:45.960
Hallelujah!

0:17:45.960,0:17:49.680
So you are no longer taking medication, you are no longer coughing,

0:17:49.680,0:17:52.080
you can breathe fine, is that right?

0:17:52.080,0:17:53.620
Yes.

0:17:53.620,0:17:56.160
Wow. We would like you to demonstrate for us, for the people of God.

0:17:56.160,0:17:59.640
Can you show us how you can breathe strongly now.

0:17:59.640,0:18:08.720
I can breathe now.

0:18:08.720,0:18:15.900
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:18:15.900,0:18:18.600
I love you, T.B. Joshua.

0:18:28.420,0:18:33.500
Since you were healed last week, tell us - what has this week been like?

0:18:33.500,0:18:36.200
How are you breathing now? Tell us the difference.

0:18:36.200,0:18:43.200
I sleep very well and no more coughing whilst I'm sleeping.

0:18:43.200,0:18:45.740
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!

0:18:45.740,0:18:49.700
She said that now she can sleep very well, she breathes easily,

0:18:49.700,0:18:53.300
she can run up and down and she doesn't get short of breath.

0:18:53.300,0:18:56.680
Who else can do it except Jesus Christ, the Miracle Worker!

0:18:56.680,0:19:02.040
Put your hands together for Him!

0:19:02.040,0:19:06.500
Wow. Thank you very much for saying your wonderful testimony in our midst.

0:19:06.500,0:19:08.880
We just want to ask you one last question.

0:19:08.880,0:19:11.480
Can you show us how you are feeling now.

0:19:16.280,0:19:19.980
Are you happy now?

0:19:19.980,0:19:21.180
Yes.

0:19:21.180,0:19:23.780
Thank You, Jesus!

0:19:23.780,0:19:27.180
Hallelujah!

0:19:27.180,0:19:29.940
Lastly, let us hear a word from the father

0:19:29.940,0:19:34.160
because we know he has joined them in going through this tough situation

0:19:34.160,0:19:36.540
as a parent to see this happening to your child

0:19:36.540,0:19:38.960
and we thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in their lives.

0:19:38.960,0:19:41.920
Sir, you are welcome. Tell us your name and where you are from.

0:19:41.920,0:19:44.520
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:19:44.520,0:19:46.840
Good Morning, Church!

0:19:46.840,0:19:51.260
Our names are Mr and Mrs Ibe Vitalis.

0:19:51.260,0:19:57.740
The problem that brought us here to The SCOAN was inability to breathe well,

0:19:57.740,0:20:04.880
sometimes she bled and in the night she coughed too much.

0:20:04.880,0:20:09.420
This problem had been a burden to us as parents.

0:20:09.420,0:20:14.060
Since you came to The SCOAN last week and she received prayer,

0:20:14.060,0:20:18.180
can you tell us what has been happening with her at home. What are the differences?

0:20:18.180,0:20:23.080
It is beyond because since we came here...

0:20:23.080,0:20:29.440
For over four years, every night, every day, she must take her medication. It was a must!

0:20:29.440,0:20:34.320
But since we came here, it is amazing up-to-date!

0:20:34.320,0:20:37.240
At night, I wake up to look at her.

0:20:37.240,0:20:42.560
She sleeps as if ... it is beyond explaining!

0:20:42.560,0:20:46.480
She is okay! Perfectly! Everything is normal!

0:20:46.480,0:20:47.800
We thank Jesus for that.

0:20:47.800,0:20:52.440
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:52.440,0:20:55.400
So you mean, before, you would always be waking up in the night

0:20:55.400,0:20:58.260
to go and check on her, to see how she is doing?

0:20:58.260,0:21:01.860
Before, her cought would wake you up.

0:21:01.860,0:21:04.440
Her cough would wake us up.

0:21:04.440,0:21:08.520
And when the cough started - at times, even if it was 1 in the morning,

0:21:08.520,0:21:10.660
one of us would drive to hospital for oxygen.

0:21:10.660,0:21:15.640
We tried all these machines but it was still too much.

0:21:15.640,0:21:20.360
You would have to take her to (hospital). Sometimes, at night, the cough would wake us up.

0:21:20.360,0:21:26.260
But since the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua last week, have you had any experience like that?

0:21:26.260,0:21:30.960
Since last week, nothing like cough at night.

0:21:30.960,0:21:32.960
She sleeps, she plays.

0:21:32.960,0:21:35.020
Even peanuts - we didn't give her peanuts before

0:21:35.020,0:21:39.000
because when she ate peanuts, you were looking for a problem.

0:21:39.000,0:21:41.900
But now, she says, "Daddy, I want peanuts!"

0:21:41.900,0:21:43.640
I will buy and she will eat.

0:21:43.640,0:21:47.160
I will be looking at her with one eye but nothing - nothing like cough.

0:21:47.160,0:21:52.820
Hallelujah! God is good! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:21:52.820,0:21:57.960
Thank you very much, sir. Lastly, what is your advice to people watching you all over the world.

0:21:57.960,0:22:01.340
My advice is this:

0:22:01.340,0:22:06.340
Parents, put your trust in God.

0:22:06.340,0:22:12.320
Whatever challenge your family is going through, know that God has the final say.

0:22:12.320,0:22:14.520
You must pray, you must fast.

0:22:14.520,0:22:16.640
Depend on God and hope on God.

0:22:16.640,0:22:19.360
At the right time, He will see you through.

0:22:19.360,0:22:20.700
Thank You, Jesus.

0:22:20.700,0:22:25.100
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ once again!

0:22:25.100,0:22:29.580
We thank God Almighty for the wonderful healing and miracle He has done in your family.

0:22:29.580,0:22:34.780
And we encourage you - miracles and all of God's blessings are in His Word.

0:22:34.780,0:22:37.240
So continue to make God's Word the standard for your life

0:22:37.240,0:22:40.200
and this shall remain permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:22:40.200,0:22:41.100
Amen.
