Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:17.520,0:00:19.880
I won't talk.

0:00:19.880,0:00:21.520
She's my wife.

0:00:21.520,0:00:23.940
What have you done to her?

0:00:23.940,0:00:29.860
She will never marry because she is mine.

0:00:29.860,0:00:31.220
What have you done to her family?

0:00:31.220,0:00:38.660
Stagnation, limitation - she will never use her certificate.

0:00:38.660,0:00:40.080
What have you done to her career?

0:00:40.080,0:00:43.820
She will be working and resigning.

0:00:43.820,0:00:48.680
She just resigned from Samsung.

TESTIMONY TIME

0:00:54.940,0:01:00.560
Children of God, shout Emmanuel for me!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:00.560,0:01:03.740
I'm here to thank God for my deliverance

0:01:03.740,0:01:07.740
by the touch of the man of God because it was a Heavenly touch.

0:01:07.740,0:01:10.420
My name is Iwuchukwu Vivian.

0:01:10.420,0:01:13.600
It all started when my father died.

0:01:13.600,0:01:20.120
Everything went wrong 
because my father was the breadwinner then.

0:01:20.120,0:01:25.080
He helped his brothers. When he died, all of them refused to help us.

0:01:25.080,0:01:31.060
One of them told us - the one in Germany, a medical doctor -

0:01:31.060,0:01:35.720
that we should leave where we were staying and go to the village.

0:01:35.720,0:01:41.060
I was kind of stubborn because of that spiritual husband.

0:01:41.060,0:01:42.660
So I refused.

0:01:42.660,0:01:47.820
I said, "I'm in school already and my younger ones are not going to stop schooling.

0:01:47.820,0:01:52.440
I will find the means for us to continue our studies".

0:01:52.440,0:01:59.520
One of my friends told me that there was a party at the government house at Owerri.

0:01:59.520,0:02:06.980
I studied logistics management technology at the University of Technology in Owerri.

0:02:06.980,0:02:10.580
So we went to the party - it was a gala night.

0:02:10.580,0:02:14.780
He told me that at that party, they would give 'thanks for coming'.

0:02:14.780,0:02:19.840
What I mean by 'thanks for coming' is: if you meet a man or not, they would give you money.

0:02:19.840,0:02:24.620
It was a caucus of senators and commissioners.

0:02:24.620,0:02:28.820
At that party I met a commissioner.

0:02:28.820,0:02:30.460
He became my friend.

0:02:30.460,0:02:34.760
That's how staying with married men started.

0:02:34.760,0:02:38.400
The man was kind of assisting me, helping me.

0:02:38.400,0:02:42.100
That's how I was able to assist my younger ones.

0:02:42.100,0:02:46.020
It continued. There was this thing I noticed about myself:

0:02:46.020,0:02:49.920
Anywhere I went to - before I was delivered -

0:02:49.920,0:02:54.280
there was this spirit that got men to be attracted to me.

0:02:54.280,0:02:57.720
When they came and we exchanged contacts,

0:02:57.720,0:03:00.820
I would be in the house and they would call me. I would go and meet them.

0:03:00.820,0:03:04.060
After sleeping with them, they would give me money.

0:03:04.060,0:03:07.760
So I would go home with it and continue my life.

0:03:07.760,0:03:15.080
The money I gathered, I used It to start little business whilst being in school like selling clothes.

0:03:15.080,0:03:19.180
I kept doing that until I finished university.

0:03:19.180,0:03:24.140
When I moved to Port Harcourt, I met new friends.

0:03:24.140,0:03:27.100
After my studies, I started work.

0:03:27.100,0:03:34.600
Like the stupid spiritual husband said:

0:03:34.600,0:03:38.600
I never used my certificate. As I worked, I resigned.

0:03:38.600,0:03:43.100
It's true because I worked for four good companies with a good job

0:03:43.100,0:03:46.280
but I ended up resigning for no reason.

0:03:46.280,0:03:52.680
I resigned on my own. Even the last one, I resigned from the company I was working for.

0:03:52.680,0:03:58.000
I left my work. I don't know about other companies but in this company,

0:03:58.000,0:04:02.160
you have to give one month notice before you can leave the company.

0:04:02.160,0:04:07.320
But I couldn't do that. I had to just forfeit my salary and resigned.

0:04:07.320,0:04:09.940
I resigned; nobody sacked me.

0:04:09.940,0:04:16.400
I know that some from my office are watching me and they know what I'm saying.

0:04:16.400,0:04:20.080
So after resigning, did you actually come back to your senses

0:04:20.080,0:04:23.900
or what normally happened after you voluntarily resigned from your job?

0:04:23.900,0:04:26.680
Still the 'men business'.

0:04:26.680,0:04:33.660
Whenever I went to the market, it was like that time it became more serious than before.

0:04:33.660,0:04:36.420
Whenever I wanted to go to the market or church,

0:04:36.420,0:04:40.200
or maybe board a cab to where I was going to,

0:04:40.200,0:04:42.220
I would just see a car by my side.

0:04:42.220,0:04:47.680
It would be a very expensive car - a machine, not just a car.

0:04:47.680,0:04:50.420
So when they stopped, I would exchange contacts.

0:04:50.420,0:04:53.640
Maybe they were not going in the direction I was going to or I was not in the mood at that moment.

0:04:53.640,0:04:57.000
I would take a complimentary card or contacts.

0:04:57.000,0:04:59.600
They would give me a call. They would be the ones to call.

0:04:59.600,0:05:02.340
They would keep disturbing me because of that spiritual husband.

0:05:02.340,0:05:04.600
It's not like I knew what I was doing.

0:05:04.600,0:05:09.660
I knew myself but what was wrong, what attracted all those things is what I didn't know.

0:05:09.660,0:05:13.740
If they were shopping for me, I would tell them, "Let me see the picture of your wife.

0:05:13.740,0:05:16.140
Why don't you shop for your wife too".

0:05:16.140,0:05:18.660
So they would say,  "Ok, this is the picture".

0:05:18.660,0:05:26.840
I would pick clothes - good clothes - or shoes.

0:05:26.840,0:05:29.680
Then the man would go home with it and give it to his wife.

0:05:29.680,0:05:31.880
The wife would think it was the husband that bought it.

0:05:31.880,0:05:36.740
No, it was the girlfriend outside who initiated that.

0:05:36.740,0:05:42.840
So that would make them to be more interested and come even closer to me.

0:05:42.840,0:05:46.960
So at that point when I got money, I didn't know what I used it for.

0:05:46.960,0:05:48.600
It was just for shopping.

0:05:48.600,0:05:53.840
Whenever I payed my bills or spent it on family issues, I was left with nothing.

0:05:53.840,0:05:57.960
So I decided, "Ok, let me just save up money and start a business.

0:05:57.960,0:06:01.340
At least I know how to style hair".

0:06:01.340,0:06:06.560
A particular man - he had spoken twice to me before -

0:06:06.560,0:06:09.320
the day that I called him that I needed money for something,

0:06:09.320,0:06:13.620
he told me that it was like I had a spiritual husband.

0:06:13.620,0:06:16.080
I said, "I have been hearing about this kind of thing".

0:06:16.080,0:06:19.500
I knew something was wrong with me but I didn't know what it was.

0:06:19.500,0:06:21.700
I agreed to go.

0:06:21.700,0:06:27.440
He set a date and we went to a place - somewhere in Enugu State.

0:06:27.440,0:06:36.480
When we entered, we reached a point where nothing like a motorcycle or car was passing.

0:06:36.480,0:06:38.380
It was a bush.

0:06:38.380,0:06:44.580
We started entering, and I asked, "What is this? Exactly where are we going to?"

0:06:44.580,0:06:52.700
At the top of this hill was an ocean or river.

0:06:52.700,0:06:57.480
People were there - plenty of people.

0:06:57.480,0:07:10.900
When you got there, they would call your name and start telling you why you came and all that.

0:07:10.900,0:07:12.220
So I was there.

0:07:12.220,0:07:22.740
They told me what I was going to pay so that they would remove the spiritual husband,

0:07:22.740,0:07:28.160
and also open my way so that things would not be difficult for me anymore.

0:07:28.160,0:07:31.080
They said I should pay N320,000.

0:07:31.080,0:07:33.740
I ended up spending that money there.

0:07:33.740,0:07:36.960
And that money - it was not that I spent it or they were using it -

0:07:36.960,0:07:45.320
they would tear the money into four pieces, throw it into the ocean and say some things.

0:07:45.320,0:07:49.220
Before then, they said that there were some things they needed to get

0:07:49.220,0:07:58.220
for me to bath in that ocean on top of that hill.

0:07:58.220,0:08:00.760
During the bath, I would do some sacrifice.

0:08:00.760,0:08:06.720
They mentioned chicken and all that. Fanta, precisely.

0:08:06.720,0:08:09.560
So when they mentioned all those things,

0:08:09.560,0:08:12.240
I said, "I can't bring all those things, I don't know where to bring it from".

0:08:12.240,0:08:15.500
They said, "Okay, pay the money. We will bring it for you".

0:08:15.500,0:08:18.420
I paid.

0:08:18.420,0:08:23.740
The money I was saving up - I ended up spending all.

0:08:23.740,0:08:27.560
So they bathed me and in the process of bathing me, they cut my hair.

0:08:27.560,0:08:32.120
They cut my nails - my toenails and my fingernails.

0:08:32.120,0:08:35.700
After performing all these sacrifices, what happened?

0:08:35.700,0:08:41.800
Were you able to make any headway towards all the problems you were encountering in your life?

0:08:41.800,0:08:44.540
My sister, nothing.

0:08:44.540,0:08:47.400
So how did you end up knowing about The SCOAN?

0:08:47.400,0:08:49.700
That you now came here and you received your deliverance?

0:08:49.700,0:08:54.120
When I was at home and I woke up from sleep -

0:08:54.120,0:08:57.260
I am the type that likes watching movies.

0:08:57.260,0:08:58.960
So I started watching a movie.

0:08:58.960,0:09:01.980
After the movie finished, there was nothing else to watch.

0:09:01.980,0:09:05.020
I was flipping through TV channels.

0:09:05.020,0:09:08.760
Prophet T.B. Joshua's channel came up.

0:09:08.760,0:09:13.260
He was saying, "Viewers all over the world" - he was praying on TV.

0:09:13.260,0:09:14.800
You mean Emmanuel TV?

0:09:14.800,0:09:17.140
Yes, Emmanuel TV.

0:09:17.140,0:09:22.800
So I prayed along with him. After praying along with him, I slept.

0:09:22.800,0:09:29.060
Something like a light came, flashed on my eyes and slapped me.

0:09:29.060,0:09:32.900
When the thing slapped me, it was like something came out of my eyes.

0:09:32.900,0:09:35.560
So I jumped up.

0:09:35.560,0:09:39.680
It was around 4 am. It was already getting to daybreak.

0:09:39.680,0:09:44.540
So as I woke up, I said, "What is this? What kind of dream is this?"

0:09:44.540,0:09:47.120
I just said a short prayer and lay down again.

0:09:47.120,0:09:50.580
In the morning, I started getting my brain back.

0:09:50.580,0:09:56.300
I started realising that it was true. That I had spent all my money on nonsense.

0:09:56.300,0:09:59.300
That what was I going to do now?

0:09:59.300,0:10:01.160
What was going on? Where was I going to start from now?

0:10:01.160,0:10:04.300
Was I to start with men again and all that?

0:10:04.300,0:10:08.860
Because that was the only point, that was what I could fall back on again.

0:10:08.860,0:10:12.580
I said to myself that I still had little money in my account.

0:10:12.580,0:10:19.020
That this was maybe because I had prayed with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV.

0:10:19.020,0:10:21.580
Let me just go there.

0:10:21.580,0:10:29.660
I went to a hotel and booked my ticket to Lagos last week.

0:10:29.660,0:10:34.420
So when I came, that's when the man of God touched me.

0:10:34.420,0:10:38.760
At that point I didn't even know where I was, I didn't know what happened next.

0:10:38.760,0:10:40.520
I just saw someone coming.

0:10:40.520,0:10:47.300
But before then, when he was coming, I was shivering. I noticed that I wasn't myself anymore.

0:10:47.300,0:10:55.920
As I was standing, the next thing I saw was a hammer on my head.

0:10:55.920,0:11:02.400
I looked. I had a complete blackout. I didn't know what happened till now.

0:11:02.400,0:11:05.780
I thank God so much.

0:11:05.780,0:11:08.460
So what are the changes that you have seen since your deliverance?

0:11:08.460,0:11:12.040
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:11:12.040,0:11:16.540
You know this deliverance is of a thing... People are used to hear of deliverance.

0:11:16.540,0:11:20.040
When you are delivered, you yourself will know that you are delivered.

0:11:20.040,0:11:21.700
You feel this joy.

0:11:21.700,0:11:24.380
On that day when I was delivered, some people - I don't know whether they are here,

0:11:24.380,0:11:28.900
they may be watching me, the people that were in the church last week.

0:11:28.900,0:11:31.960
I was so excited.

0:11:31.960,0:11:36.760
My body was sweating as if I had won something somewhere.

0:11:36.760,0:11:45.040
I'm now okay. I'm free. I sleep well. I wake up well. I don't have those thoughts anymore.

0:11:45.040,0:11:49.440
They don't even call. I've deleted all their numbers.

0:11:49.440,0:11:51.840
I'm intending to change my telephone number.

0:11:51.840,0:12:00.160
And what about the spiritual husband that used to torment you in your dreams?

0:12:00.160,0:12:02.740
That one - he has gone back to where he came from.

0:12:02.740,0:12:04.740
To the pit of hell!

0:12:04.740,0:12:09.760
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:12:09.760,0:12:13.680
We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful deliverance that you have received.

0:12:13.680,0:12:20.360
What do you want to advise people that are listening to your wonderful testimony?

0:12:20.360,0:12:22.460
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:12:22.460,0:12:29.240
My advice goes to young men and young ladies:

0:12:29.240,0:12:35.040
To be frank, all these we are seeing while being on campus...

0:12:35.040,0:12:40.580
First of all, choose your friends. Don't let your friends choose you.

0:12:40.580,0:12:45.620
Secondly, if you're a young girl, and you noticed...

0:12:45.620,0:12:50.220
I'm not giving this testimony to entice you.

0:12:50.220,0:12:56.000
I'm giving it and praying to God that this testimony will change a soul

0:12:56.000,0:13:00.900
because then I was in the world; now I'm a new creation.

0:13:00.900,0:13:03.080
I'm not ashamed of my testimony.

0:13:03.080,0:13:06.940
I'm so proud of myself because I have finally made it.

0:13:06.940,0:13:12.140
And I know that I am okay. I also pray that any young lady that is listening to me here,

0:13:12.140,0:13:15.860
please go to a living church.

0:13:15.860,0:13:18.780
If you are not sure of any, run to The SCOAN -

0:13:18.780,0:13:22.440
just the same way I used my last money and paid for my flight ticket to this place.

0:13:22.440,0:13:25.260
Come here and you will get your deliverance.

0:13:25.260,0:13:30.360
And also your salvation will increase.

0:13:30.360,0:13:34.620
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:13:34.620,0:13:39.880
My name is Vivian Iwuchukwu. I am from Port Harcourt.

0:13:39.880,0:13:44.180
What brought me to the church was my deliverance, which I have gotten.

0:13:44.180,0:13:46.860
I thank God. I'm delivered now, and I'm okay.

0:13:46.860,0:13:51.200
I was in the congregation when the man of God was touching people at the side where I was.

0:13:51.200,0:13:56.400
He touched me, and the spiritual husband inside of me manifested.

0:13:56.400,0:14:00.180
He was saying that I will not use my certificate,

0:14:00.180,0:14:04.220
I will not get married and that I will be working and resigning,

0:14:04.220,0:14:06.520
which I confirmed to be true.

0:14:06.520,0:14:12.380
I also thank God that after the deliverance, I'm now okay,

0:14:12.380,0:14:17.680
my dreams are fine, everything is okay.

0:14:17.680,0:14:23.800
The evil spirit pushed me to be with married men.

0:14:23.800,0:14:27.060
I stayed with them, they gave me money.

0:14:27.060,0:14:32.300
At the end of the day, I couldn't give account of the money.

0:14:32.300,0:14:37.640
When I was working, I resigned from four companies.

0:14:37.640,0:14:42.720
When I resigned from the last company, I had to run to God for help

0:14:42.720,0:14:46.880
because I didn't know what was happening to me anymore.

0:14:46.880,0:14:53.060
I was eating in my dreams. At times, I would be at a riverside or ocean.

0:14:53.060,0:14:58.400
At times, I would have an affair in my dreams.

0:14:58.400,0:15:03.100
Since your deliverance at The SCOAN, after Prophet T.B. Joshua had prayed for you,

0:15:03.100,0:15:05.540
tell us how your life has changed.

0:15:05.540,0:15:10.900
Now I am a new person. I feel so happy inside my heart, inside of me.

0:15:10.900,0:15:14.220
I sleep very well. My dreams are fine.

0:15:14.220,0:15:18.400
I sleep singing in my dreams, and I wake up singing.

0:15:18.400,0:15:21.740
Reading the Bible is now part of me.

0:15:21.740,0:15:25.280
I always meditate with my faith bracelet.

0:15:25.280,0:15:30.780
It is always with me which is helping me to build my faith more,

0:15:30.780,0:15:33.620
to maintain my deliverance and my salvation.

0:15:33.620,0:15:37.700
By the grace of God, I want to be self-employed and independent,

0:15:37.700,0:15:42.780
make money myself and help my family instead of going the other way round.

0:15:42.780,0:15:47.260
To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.

0:15:47.260,0:15:53.740
Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners are very much concerned about you

0:15:53.740,0:15:56.200
and the next step that you want to take in Christ Jesus,

0:15:56.200,0:15:59.580
to make sure that you continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:15:59.580,0:16:05.260
They are supporting you with this sum of 200,000 naira.

Vivian Receives N200,000 From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners To Start A New Life In Christ

0:16:12.740,0:16:18.120
I want to thank God for this and also thank the man of God so much

0:16:18.120,0:16:24.240
because this is a new beginning and I know this money is coming from the altar

0:16:24.240,0:16:31.180
and it will go a long way. It will bear fruits - more than the money out there.

0:16:31.180,0:16:34.180
I'm so happy to start my life with this.

0:16:34.180,0:16:39.580
I want to tell the man of God: May the Almighty God keep him for us

0:16:39.580,0:16:43.300
because he is the prophet of our generation.

0:16:43.300,0:16:48.860
His family - favour befall them. He will grow from strength to strength,

0:16:48.860,0:16:51.720
anointing to anointing, grace to grace.

0:16:51.720,0:16:54.040
Heaven will always be with him.

0:16:54.040,0:16:59.200
I thank God for his life, and I promise him I'll make it up to him.

0:16:59.200,0:17:03.240
I'll make him proud with this, in Jesus' name.

0:17:03.240,0:17:04.960
Amen. To God be the glory.

0:17:04.960,0:17:07.800
We pray that God Almighty gives you that grace to stay far from sin

0:17:07.800,0:17:11.160
and close to Him as you continue to make God's Word the standard for your life.

0:17:11.160,0:17:15.160
So lastly, give a word of advice to people watching you all over the world.

0:17:15.160,0:17:18.220
My advice to people like I said on Sunday:

0:17:18.220,0:17:21.620
To ladies - if you notice that something is wrong with you

0:17:21.620,0:17:25.820
and maybe you are going off track, please run to God.

0:17:25.820,0:17:29.940
He is the only solution. He is the only way for you to have peace of mind.

0:17:29.940,0:17:34.300
Please emulate the Word of God. That's the only way out.

0:17:34.300,0:17:40.100
With your Bible, call on the Holy Spirit. He will see you through.

0:17:40.100,0:17:44.400
Amen. We want to encourage you too that it is not all about the situation you are facing,

0:17:44.400,0:17:48.820
nor where you are but who you are in Christ Jesus that really matters.

0:17:48.820,0:17:53.020
Everyone faces common challenges and calamities of life

0:17:53.020,0:17:55.700
but what makes you a Christian, what makes you a child of God

0:17:55.700,0:17:59.240
is not what you go through, but how you go through them.

0:17:59.240,0:18:02.620
So continue to choose God's way and not the way of the world

0:18:02.620,0:18:06.320
and the best is yet to come for you and your family, in Jesus' name.

0:18:06.320,0:18:08.360
Amen.

0:18:08.360,0:18:09.820
Thank you.

0:18:09.820,0:18:13.800
Thank You, Jesus, I am free. Thank You, Holy Spirit, for this opportunity.

0:18:13.800,0:18:17.880
Thank you because I'll make good use of it, in Jesus' name. Amen
