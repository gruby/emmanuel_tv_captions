PRAYER TIME

0:00:03.200,0:00:09.620
Say in the name of Jesus, you demon, OUT!!!!

0:00:09.620,0:00:27.060
Out!

0:00:27.060,0:00:28.900
Command them to come out right now.

0:00:28.900,0:00:30.860
I am his wife.

0:00:30.860,0:00:32.500
What have you done to him?

0:00:32.500,0:00:34.780
I made him useless.

0:00:34.780,0:00:35.980
What have you done to his career?

0:00:35.980,0:00:38.360
He can't do anything, he can't progress - nothing.

0:00:38.360,0:00:39.660
How did you enter him?

0:00:39.660,0:00:42.180
I make love to him.

0:00:42.180,0:00:46.040
Many nights when he is about to meet his success, I make love to him

0:00:46.040,0:00:50.120
and just render him useless.

0:00:50.120,0:00:54.340
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:00:54.340,0:00:56.700
Children of God, Emmanuel!

0:00:56.700,0:00:59.380
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:59.380,0:01:06.160
My name is Daniel, and the lady standing beside me is my mum.

0:01:06.160,0:01:09.560
I was delivered from a spiritual wife.

0:01:09.560,0:01:12.400
It all started when things got rough

0:01:12.400,0:01:15.200
so we had to relocate back to the village.

0:01:15.200,0:01:19.240
I went to sit for my WAEC exams.

0:01:19.240,0:01:21.140
I was an external student.

0:01:21.140,0:01:26.820
There was this day I was walking out with my friend, going back to school.

0:01:26.820,0:01:35.240
A man - a priest because he wore a white cassock - stopped his car.

0:01:35.240,0:01:37.920
He pointed out to my friend and said, "Come!"

0:01:37.920,0:01:40.600
I was thinking it was my friend so I pushed my friend forward

0:01:40.600,0:01:43.000
and said, "You are the one he is calling".

0:01:43.000,0:01:47.620
My friend stepped forward, and he said, "No, not you - him!"

0:01:47.620,0:01:50.860
So I came and he spoke to me.

0:01:50.860,0:01:54.720
I didn't know him so I just wanted to be nice.

0:01:54.720,0:01:59.900
I greeted him and he asked me what I was doing there

0:01:59.900,0:02:02.300
and I told him I came for an exam.

0:02:02.300,0:02:04.940
He told me that I was good looking

0:02:04.940,0:02:07.860
and he wanted to know me later.

0:02:07.860,0:02:10.320
He was like, could he get my number.

0:02:10.320,0:02:19.260
At first I just wanted to walk away but I stayed back just to be polite.

0:02:19.260,0:02:23.780
I gave him my number and that is how the whole thing started.

0:02:23.780,0:02:28.560
From time to time, he called to check up and there was this day

0:02:28.560,0:02:32.700
that he finally invited me over to his place.

0:02:32.700,0:02:37.800
That is when he made advances at me

0:02:37.800,0:02:45.880
and I was shocked because I know priests represent God.

0:02:45.880,0:02:48.540
Like servants here on earth.

0:02:48.540,0:02:50.940
I was seeing the different side of this person.

0:02:50.940,0:02:56.940
When he made advances at me, I wanted to walk away.

0:02:56.940,0:03:01.840
He pulled me back and said that it was alright, that if I didn't want to,

0:03:01.840,0:03:04.620
it was no problem, he was not in a rush.

0:03:04.620,0:03:10.340
For the benefit of the viewers all over the world, what do you mean

0:03:10.340,0:03:16.440
by 'he made advances at you' - what did that actually mean?

0:03:16.440,0:03:19.640
He tried to kiss me.

0:03:19.640,0:03:20.820
To have an affair with you?

0:03:20.820,0:03:22.580
Yes, he tried to have an affair with me.

0:03:22.580,0:03:23.780
That is, man to man?

0:03:23.780,0:03:25.400
Yes, man to man.

0:03:25.400,0:03:30.860
I saw it as insane, but I couldn't say anything then.

0:03:30.860,0:03:33.820
Have you had such an experience before in your life?

0:03:33.820,0:03:35.760
No. Never.

0:03:35.760,0:03:38.820
I told him that I couldn't do that and

0:03:38.820,0:03:40.980
he told me that it was okay, he was not in a hurry,

0:03:40.980,0:03:43.900
that it takes time and all that.

0:03:43.900,0:03:46.160
I left.

0:03:46.160,0:03:50.740
When I came back home, my friend asked me what had happened, if he gave me something.

0:03:50.740,0:03:54.240
I said, "Nothing, I just went to see him".

0:03:54.240,0:03:59.320
What age were you by that time?

0:03:59.320,0:04:05.100
I was at 20, 22.

0:04:05.100,0:04:11.420
He called again. I was like I was never to go back there again.

0:04:11.420,0:04:17.240
I slept and had a dream.

0:04:17.240,0:04:22.560
There were these people surrounding me - they were many.

0:04:22.560,0:04:26.000
It was like an island.

0:04:26.000,0:04:30.580
I was there, they were dancing, doing all sorts of things.

0:04:30.580,0:04:33.700
I woke up because I was shocked;

0:04:33.700,0:04:35.900
it was the first time I had such a dream.

0:04:35.900,0:04:38.920
I couldn't tell anybody; I just went along with it.

0:04:38.920,0:04:43.520
So it was after this encounter you had with the man that you had this dream?

0:04:43.520,0:04:44.220
Yes.

0:04:44.220,0:04:46.180
So what happened after the dream?

0:04:46.180,0:04:51.120
I woke up. I couldn't tell anybody, not even my mum.

0:04:51.120,0:04:53.640
I couldn't call to tell them.

0:04:53.640,0:04:55.960
Despite the fact that we were brought up in the way of the Lord,

0:04:55.960,0:04:58.480
I was like - let it be.

0:04:58.480,0:05:00.500
It is a normal dream.

0:05:00.500,0:05:08.280
The next time he called, I found that I didn't hesitate.

0:05:08.280,0:05:15.220
He asked me to come over and I went to his place.

0:05:15.220,0:05:20.520
He made the same advances at me and I played along.

0:05:20.520,0:05:26.280
But we did not have serious intimacy.

0:05:26.280,0:05:33.380
So as I left, he came to me and said that I would have to come some other time.

0:05:33.380,0:05:36.920
Time and time went and it kept being like that.

0:05:36.920,0:05:39.840
I managed to gain favors from him

0:05:39.840,0:05:44.360
and I went on with the whole thing, and I felt it was 'cool'.

0:05:44.360,0:05:48.160
That is how it was and after I left school -

0:05:48.160,0:05:58.060
I was done with the WAEC exams and left - he kept on calling.

0:05:58.060,0:06:02.060
The distance was already there and we couldn't meet.

0:06:02.060,0:06:04.620
Every time he called and asked me to come over,

0:06:04.620,0:06:06.920
I resisted, saying I had things to do

0:06:06.920,0:06:09.600
because every time I left the house,

0:06:09.600,0:06:13.840
I had to explain where I was going to or what I was going to do.

0:06:13.840,0:06:18.300
So that connection was cut short.

0:06:18.300,0:06:27.740
I then wrote the JAM exams and I passed - I had 241.

0:06:27.740,0:06:36.040
We were actually preparing for other exams when my brother called.

0:06:36.040,0:06:43.320
He said he wanted me to come over to Ghana because he is based there.

0:06:43.320,0:06:49.420
My mother said that I had to go to school first,

0:06:49.420,0:06:57.640
but my dad said, "Let him go, it's better this way".

0:06:57.640,0:07:04.720
He explained to me that whenever I am together with my brother, I can do better.

0:07:04.720,0:07:08.640
So we abandoned the fact that I had to go to school

0:07:08.640,0:07:10.840
and I went to Ghana.

0:07:10.840,0:07:14.140
I stayed with my brother there.

0:07:14.140,0:07:21.020
That is when I met someone who had the 'same thing' as me because this person...

0:07:21.020,0:07:22.980
We want to be carried along.

0:07:22.980,0:07:29.440
So when you travelled to Ghana, you lost contact with this first man

0:07:29.440,0:07:32.820
and you said you met a person with the 'same thing' -

0:07:32.820,0:07:34.840
what is that thing?

0:07:34.840,0:07:43.560
The person whom I met was the owner of the place where we stayed in Ghana.

0:07:43.560,0:07:47.400
At first he was like a friend.

0:07:47.400,0:07:50.900
He does business with my brother.

0:07:50.900,0:07:53.180
You mean he also had the spirit of man?

0:07:53.180,0:07:56.500
Yes, he also had that spirit in him.

0:07:56.500,0:08:05.780
So then, we always talked, he developed this interest in me.

0:08:05.780,0:08:10.600
It went on and when I started having problems

0:08:10.600,0:08:15.300
with my brother because of that spirit and left,

0:08:15.300,0:08:19.960
that is when he opened up to me who he was.

0:08:19.960,0:08:26.520
At that period, I was at his place and he made advances and we went intimate.

0:08:26.520,0:08:27.940
It kept on being like that.

0:08:27.940,0:08:32.740
It happened each time when I was in the midst of getting something,

0:08:32.740,0:08:34.760
when I was walking towards something,

0:08:34.760,0:08:38.580
when I 'went down' with a man, the whole thing crumbled.

0:08:38.580,0:08:42.140
I found myself sleeping with women in the dream.

0:08:42.140,0:08:47.200
I didn't have much in the physical but in my spiritual life,

0:08:47.200,0:08:50.660
I found myself owning cars and stuffs and all that.

0:08:50.660,0:08:53.920
I slept with a lot of women; they used different faces

0:08:53.920,0:09:00.500
of people I know or people I must have seen somewhere.

0:09:00.500,0:09:03.960
And that is how every thing I put my hands on crumbled.

0:09:03.960,0:09:10.860
I couldn't stay because that spirit was always pushing me to move forward.

0:09:10.860,0:09:16.380
So I couldn't stay, because each time I am in a place and they like to turn on...

0:09:16.380,0:09:22.380
Because my brother is the type who is always listening to ministration,

0:09:22.380,0:09:26.960
he is always watching Emmanuel TV.

0:09:26.960,0:09:30.620
Each time he watched it, I just walked away

0:09:30.620,0:09:32.540
because I didn't want to be there.

0:09:32.540,0:09:35.400
What would make you walk away from watching Emmanuel TV?

0:09:35.400,0:09:38.600
My body became very very hot.

0:09:38.600,0:09:39.740
Why?

0:09:39.740,0:09:45.780
I can't really say because each time I sat down and they prayed, especially the mass prayer,

0:09:45.780,0:09:48.500
it happened every time there was a prayer.

0:09:48.500,0:09:50.780
By that time, what spirit was in you?

0:09:50.780,0:09:57.180
At that period, I had this spirit to sleep with men.

0:09:57.180,0:10:01.280
Because of that spirit of man in you,

0:10:01.280,0:10:04.740
when you saw Emmanuel TV prayer going on,

0:10:04.740,0:10:06.960
you couldn't stay, you always walked away, is that right?

0:10:06.960,0:10:13.400
Yes, I couldn't stay because I felt that my whole body was very very hot.

0:10:13.400,0:10:18.520
So because of this urge in you,

0:10:18.520,0:10:24.520
how did you meet with fellow men that you often went out with,

0:10:24.520,0:10:28.600
and how did you identify when you saw people that had the same spirit

0:10:28.600,0:10:30.980
that you were having - the spirit of man?

0:10:30.980,0:10:40.460
It happened that each time I went out, my relationship with females was lesser,

0:10:40.460,0:10:46.240
my relationship with men was more than with females.

0:10:46.240,0:10:49.720
Each time I met with someone who had that same spirit,

0:10:49.720,0:10:52.980
that spirit of being with a man,

0:10:52.980,0:10:58.980
it's easy because 'the devil does know the devil'.

0:10:58.980,0:11:02.960
Each time I was with someone, friends, men,

0:11:02.960,0:11:06.160
and I saw someone who had the same spirit -

0:11:06.160,0:11:09.800
at first I would sit and admire, that is what I did;

0:11:09.800,0:11:12.460
and if the person admired back,

0:11:12.460,0:11:15.320
it meant that we are game, so I would step out and we would talk.

0:11:15.320,0:11:17.960
We would just have a normal discussion.

0:11:17.960,0:11:24.720
Then we break - the person breaks up and tells me who he is or he likes men.

0:11:24.720,0:11:28.780
and I equally expose myself by telling the person that I equally like men.

0:11:28.780,0:11:38.720
Okay. Did you get any form of payment for going out with men like yourself

0:11:38.720,0:11:44.220
or did you actually get paid, and what were the caliber of men you went out with?

0:11:44.220,0:11:49.740
OK, I went out with high-class boys;

0:11:49.740,0:11:55.540
those were the kind of guys that every normal boy of my age would want.

0:11:55.540,0:11:57.460
You would see them out there and say,

0:11:57.460,0:12:03.900
"Wow! I would like this kind of person".

0:12:03.900,0:12:07.060
I didnt't get paid for it all the time.

0:12:07.060,0:12:08.900
I just got favors from them.

0:12:08.900,0:12:10.740
They would say, "I will do this for you".

0:12:10.740,0:12:14.440
After the whole thing, after we had slept together,

0:12:14.440,0:12:17.580
they would say that they would do this for me.

0:12:17.580,0:12:19.820
I didn't get to ask.

0:12:19.820,0:12:25.920
What happened when you were at school?

0:12:25.920,0:12:29.640
Tell us more about your school life.

0:12:29.640,0:12:34.480
Then I came back to Nigeria, and I had to start all over again.

0:12:34.480,0:12:37.820
I met a friend who was a banker.

0:12:37.820,0:12:43.740
He was the one who actually talked me into going back to school.

0:12:43.740,0:12:45.760
That was when I was looking for a job.

0:12:45.760,0:12:49.500
I met him and he wanted to help me.

0:12:49.500,0:12:52.440
After I got admission, he was helping me out.

0:12:52.440,0:12:55.820
He equally had the same spirit in him.

0:12:55.820,0:12:58.580
He had the spirit of being with a man.

0:12:58.580,0:13:00.600
He was always helping me out

0:13:00.600,0:13:03.300
and things like that happened.

0:13:03.300,0:13:08.960
I found out that each time I got upset, there was nobody that could control me.

0:13:08.960,0:13:14.720
Nobody could talk me out of it or get to calm me down.

0:13:14.720,0:13:19.460
So all along, your parents didn't know you were living this life?

0:13:19.460,0:13:24.820
No, nobody except me. I kept it to myself.

0:13:24.820,0:13:28.400
I just didn't want to tell anybody who I was then.

0:13:28.400,0:13:32.880
So when you went to school, did you get involved into other things,

0:13:32.880,0:13:37.500
apart from meeting with fellow men like yourself?

0:13:37.500,0:13:44.820
Yes, even then, when I got admission, my mum took me to a church where they prayed for me.

0:13:44.820,0:13:51.040
The prophet there prophesied to me that he sees me joining a cult,

0:13:51.040,0:13:56.940
that they will lure me into a cult.

0:13:56.940,0:14:01.800
It didn't just stop there because when I went to school,

0:14:01.800,0:14:06.520
I was always upset and I always wanted more.

0:14:06.520,0:14:10.700
So I went out and I was with a friend -

0:14:10.700,0:14:14.700
in our lodge, you got to find different kinds of people.

0:14:14.700,0:14:20.580
In that place where I stayed, you got to find drug addicts, prostitutes.

0:14:20.580,0:14:25.200
So I was there in a school and I was equally working as of then.

0:14:25.200,0:14:30.000
Working and schooling wasn't easy because I was a regular student.

0:14:30.000,0:14:33.520
I had to do like three weeks at work and one week at school

0:14:33.520,0:14:35.400
so I couldn't concentrate.

0:14:35.400,0:14:39.480
I was with my friend one day, and we were drinking.

0:14:39.480,0:14:42.900
I used to drink and do drugs; I did hard drugs.

0:14:42.900,0:14:47.280
I did codeine, and all that.

0:14:47.280,0:14:51.280
I smoked weed.

0:14:51.280,0:14:55.840
I didn't smoke normal cigarettes as any other person would want to do.

0:14:55.840,0:14:58.180
I got to do hard drugs.

0:14:58.180,0:15:02.920
I did tramadol, I did so many of them.

0:15:02.920,0:15:08.080
Have your parents ever heard of this?

0:15:08.080,0:15:10.420
No, they haven't.

0:15:10.420,0:15:12.840
So your mother is hearing this for the first time?

0:15:12.840,0:15:16.060
My mum is actually hearing this for the first time.

0:15:16.060,0:15:18.780
And it happened that way.

0:15:18.780,0:15:29.100
I was with a friend one day, and he asked me to accompany him somewhere.

0:15:29.100,0:15:31.600
Then we were 'high', 'stoned'.

0:15:31.600,0:15:34.140
We were trying to calm ourselves down.

0:15:34.140,0:15:37.920
We were 'stoned' and he talked to me and I played along.

0:15:37.920,0:15:43.160
I went out with him and I didn't know where he was actually taking me.

0:15:43.160,0:15:45.420
He was always telling me -

0:15:45.420,0:15:48.420
each time he saw me upset and I got to calm down -

0:15:48.420,0:15:52.180
he was always telling me that he saw a great person in me.

0:15:52.180,0:15:55.800
That is when I joined the cult.

0:15:55.800,0:15:58.400
It is a popular cult.

0:15:58.400,0:16:04.100
I joined, and on the day of initiation, I was taken to the ground -

0:16:04.100,0:16:06.380
they call it 'the arena ground'.

0:16:06.380,0:16:08.300
I was taken there.

0:16:08.300,0:16:12.900
We were so many and we had to bow our heads down.

0:16:12.900,0:16:15.860
We didn't see each other, we couldn't see, it was dark.

0:16:15.860,0:16:17.480
The whole place was dark.

0:16:17.480,0:16:24.060
We were taken, we were all beaten for seven good hours;

0:16:24.060,0:16:28.120
we were beaten very hard with logs.

0:16:28.120,0:16:30.380
Some people passed out in the process,

0:16:30.380,0:16:33.180
some died because it was not easy

0:16:33.180,0:16:36.780
for you to stand a 7 hours torture - nobody,

0:16:36.780,0:16:38.860
no matter how strong you are.

0:16:38.860,0:16:42.500
I found out that then, I felt no pain.

0:16:42.500,0:16:46.500
I was there, I took the whole thing for 7 good hours.

0:16:46.500,0:16:49.580
After the whole thing they gave me the name.

0:16:49.580,0:16:53.260
They said it's a strong name that is always there to guide me,

0:16:53.260,0:16:59.420
that the person who had the name before was a strong person.

0:16:59.420,0:17:02.840
So that spirit commanded to do things.

0:17:02.840,0:17:06.200
So what was the name you were given in the cult?

0:17:06.200,0:17:11.020
I was actually called 'Field Marshal Idi Amin Dada'.

0:17:11.020,0:17:12.480
It's a strong name.

0:17:12.480,0:17:14.320
So I never used to answer my own name.

0:17:14.320,0:17:16.480
They said it's the Jew name.

0:17:16.480,0:17:19.500
So I would not be known, we wouldn't get to address ourselves,

0:17:19.500,0:17:24.040
except we were in the public so that we wouldn't expose ourselves.

0:17:24.040,0:17:28.420
So can you tell us some of those activities that you partook in

0:17:28.420,0:17:30.820
when you joined the cult

0:17:30.820,0:17:33.700
and what was your position in the cult?

0:17:33.700,0:17:36.880
The name given to me was a name of someone

0:17:36.880,0:17:40.640
who was actually stronger than I was.

0:17:40.640,0:17:44.700
I was actually being groomed to take the person's position.

0:17:44.700,0:17:46.580
Nobody knows about that.

0:17:46.580,0:17:52.760
So I never used to go to school, I would drink, I would party a lot.

0:17:52.760,0:17:57.160
Every time I woke up and wanted to go to work, I was 'stoned'.

0:17:57.160,0:17:59.940
I was stoned, I had to take my bath so many times.

0:17:59.940,0:18:03.940
When I got to work, nobody would notice, I just acted normal.

0:18:03.940,0:18:07.720
So all this while, your parents thought you were in the school studying?

0:18:07.720,0:18:11.160
All this while, they thought I was in school studying.

0:18:11.160,0:18:14.740
My mum called because I am closer to my mum,

0:18:14.740,0:18:20.080
and I know right now she feels so disappointed in me.

0:18:20.080,0:18:22.980
Evey time she called and asked if I prayed...

0:18:22.980,0:18:24.520
I never used to go to church.

0:18:24.520,0:18:27.580
There was nothing you could tell me about God that I wanted to listen.

0:18:27.580,0:18:31.140
Why would I want to go to church when I had a swell time

0:18:31.140,0:18:34.220
smoking and getting stoned,

0:18:34.220,0:18:36.880
getting to see a lot of girls.

0:18:36.880,0:18:41.300
Where would I get the time to worship and focus on God?

0:18:41.300,0:18:43.240
So it wasn't there.

0:18:43.240,0:18:48.900
A lot of my time was spent in the club and with friends

0:18:48.900,0:18:51.380
who we went out with doing bad things.

0:18:51.380,0:18:54.760
So what happened later?

0:18:54.760,0:19:00.840
At school, at the initiation ground, I was asked to do something,

0:19:00.840,0:19:03.060
we took an oath.

0:19:03.060,0:19:08.520
We were asked how many people we would kill for the cult.

0:19:08.520,0:19:14.440
If you were asked that question, you would just say that you will kill many.

0:19:14.440,0:19:21.020
And with that oath you were expected to do what you promised to them.

0:19:21.020,0:19:26.880
I was given my own pistol. I have a picture of it on my phone.

0:19:26.880,0:19:32.360
I went on with that - no school.

0:19:32.360,0:19:35.860
The painful part is that they were believing I was in school,

0:19:35.860,0:19:37.680
but I wasn't in school.

0:19:37.680,0:19:40.280
I was just working, that is what I told myself

0:19:40.280,0:19:44.880
because from January till today I don't even own a dime to myself

0:19:44.880,0:19:48.000
because I spent everything there.

0:19:48.000,0:19:51.080
The least I know I payed for were my  textbooks.

0:19:51.080,0:19:55.560
And as for my school fees - I used them to purchase a pistol for myself.

0:19:55.560,0:20:02.240
So then the heat was too much because you got to see rivals from other cults.

0:20:02.240,0:20:07.540
So while they were still grooming me, I was playing along.

0:20:07.540,0:20:11.220
At the end of the day, I would be better than the person who had this name before,

0:20:11.220,0:20:13.880
and I would do many things for them,

0:20:13.880,0:20:16.920
so that was the promise I made.

0:20:16.920,0:20:23.740
What actually lured me back to them was that I was a fraudster -

0:20:23.740,0:20:26.120
that is what I used to do.

0:20:26.120,0:20:29.760
Working with them - what actually brought me to my friend,

0:20:29.760,0:20:36.300
was when he told me that if I were with them, I would get more connections.

0:20:36.300,0:20:41.480
And in no time would I get my own car and house - comfortably,

0:20:41.480,0:20:44.100
and I would get to take care of who I want to take care of.

0:20:44.100,0:20:46.460
That is what actually took me in,

0:20:46.460,0:20:49.460
and he saw that spirit to command,

0:20:49.460,0:20:53.780
that ability to do many things for the cult.

0:20:53.780,0:20:56.900
We were always given tools to work,

0:20:56.900,0:20:59.900
I had a camera - a webcam,

0:20:59.900,0:21:03.260
a recorded video of both a male and a female.

0:21:03.260,0:21:06.860
So we wrote to people and browsed on the internet

0:21:06.860,0:21:11.440
and we would tell them different stories.

0:21:11.440,0:21:17.180
If I used a female camera, I made the guy to come after me,

0:21:17.180,0:21:19.500
and he would want to meet me.

0:21:19.500,0:21:23.640
And I would tell him that I am busy - just to give him an excuse.

0:21:23.640,0:21:30.080
So you posed as a female by using a video or pictures of a female?

0:21:30.080,0:21:31.100
Yes.

0:21:31.100,0:21:36.140
I owned a female video and several pictures of her.

0:21:36.140,0:21:41.720
I used it to work - each time they told me that they wanted to see me,

0:21:41.720,0:21:45.080
I would pose and give them a video cam - a recorded cam.

0:21:45.080,0:21:48.480
There was a software I used to play the cam.

0:21:48.480,0:21:51.600
When you were looking at me, you wouldn't see me

0:21:51.600,0:21:56.080
that is playing the cam, you would get to watch the recorded cam.

0:21:56.080,0:21:58.320
So what did you get from these people at the end of the day -

0:21:58.320,0:22:04.420
those that you succeeded in deceiving?

0:22:04.420,0:22:09.620
We gave them bills, we dealt with them.

0:22:09.620,0:22:15.000
We knew that it was not possible appearing before the person physically.

0:22:15.000,0:22:18.920
We told the person that we were going to send the person our package,

0:22:18.920,0:22:21.580
our personal belongings to them,

0:22:21.580,0:22:25.260
for them to believe that we were actually coming.

0:22:25.260,0:22:33.960
Each time we told them that, we would send fake stuffs or fake documents to them to make them believe

0:22:33.960,0:22:38.860
and they payed for the belongings.

0:22:38.860,0:22:43.400
You have defrauded a lot of people through this means?

0:22:43.400,0:22:44.100
Yes.

0:22:44.100,0:22:46.900
Okay, tell us as a result of the cult activities,

0:22:46.900,0:22:49.960
what did that lead you to? Are you still in school today?

0:22:49.960,0:22:53.060
What was happening to your life before this deliverance?

0:22:53.060,0:22:58.140
Before this deliverance, I couldn't stay at school anymore because

0:22:58.140,0:23:05.000
the rival cult came against the cult that I used to be with

0:23:05.000,0:23:08.020
and I was still being groomed.

0:23:08.020,0:23:11.540
I didn't know much, I only knew the basics,

0:23:11.540,0:23:13.940
I only knew little things

0:23:13.940,0:23:17.540
but I was groomed for something, that's all I knew.

0:23:17.540,0:23:19.920
But I owned a pistol.

0:23:19.920,0:23:22.140
So you dropped out of school at the end of the day?

0:23:22.140,0:23:22.980
Yes.

0:23:22.980,0:23:27.840
So what was life like before you came for this deliverance?

0:23:27.840,0:23:31.580
I dropped out of school because I didn't pay the school fees.

0:23:31.580,0:23:34.360
I used my fees to purchase an arm for myself.

0:23:34.360,0:23:38.700
When you came to The SCOAN, tell us what happened.

0:23:38.700,0:23:49.400
I had to leave school, I lost the job that I was doing.

0:23:49.400,0:23:57.120
I came back to Lagos because I talked to a director of mine and he told me that

0:23:57.120,0:23:59.340
he was going to get me a job here in Lagos.

0:23:59.340,0:24:03.800
I came to Lagos with a mind of getting a job.

0:24:03.800,0:24:05.874
I didn't tell anybody what had happened,

0:24:05.880,0:24:10.440
the least I told them is that there was a hit and I was beaten badly

0:24:10.440,0:24:12.260
and I had to leave school.

0:24:12.260,0:24:16.800
I came back to Lagos thinking I was going to get a job.

0:24:16.800,0:24:22.240
My friend who talked me into coming here told me that I should come to church,

0:24:22.240,0:24:27.780
believing God that I would get something after I confessed.

0:24:27.780,0:24:31.300
And last Sunday during the mass prayer, what happened to you?

0:24:31.300,0:24:37.040
At the mass prayer when they started praying, I couldn't control myself.

0:24:37.040,0:24:40.600
I noticed that my entire body was so hot.

0:24:40.600,0:24:44.360
Even the building was too hot.

0:24:44.360,0:24:46.920
The man sitting beside me was equally hot,

0:24:46.920,0:24:52.340
so I told him that he should excuse me I wanted to pee.

0:24:52.340,0:24:57.240
He said, "You cannot go anywhere, that is how it starts,

0:24:57.240,0:24:59.380
and you get to miss your deliverance".

0:24:59.380,0:25:03.860
I was there and I got so upset. I just wanted to unleash it on him.

0:25:03.860,0:25:07.960
So I sat down quietly and the next thing I heard a voice saying,

0:25:07.960,0:25:11.940
"Just keep calm, it's just a normal thing and nothing is going to happen".

0:25:11.940,0:25:21.140
During the ministration of the Morning Water I was sitting at the back.

0:25:21.140,0:25:28.280
It wasn't even my turn, the Morning Water was being ministered to someone else.

0:25:28.280,0:25:31.460
I was feeling too hot.

0:25:31.460,0:25:34.660
I wasn't feeling comfortable in my own clothes.

0:25:34.660,0:25:37.780
When the evangelist stepped forward to me,

0:25:37.780,0:25:42.040
I just lost it, I couldn't remember anything.

0:25:42.040,0:25:48.860
The only thing I noticed was that I woke up and I saw myself on the floor.

0:25:48.860,0:25:53.320
Quite embarrassing but I stood there because I was helpless and

0:25:53.320,0:25:58.020
I knew all this while something was wrong with me

0:25:58.020,0:26:01.960
because there was nothing I ever did that worked out.

0:26:01.960,0:26:05.540
Each time someone wanted to help me I ended up

0:26:05.540,0:26:09.400
making love with a strange lady in my dream and I would lose all of it.

0:26:09.400,0:26:13.120
I got angry so easily and no one could control me.

0:26:13.120,0:26:17.620
I had known that there was something wrong with me

0:26:17.620,0:26:21.640
and I had always wanted to get out.

0:26:21.640,0:26:24.400
And since after your deliverance can you tell us -

0:26:24.400,0:26:31.620
what is your condition now, what are the signs of a delivered person?

0:26:31.620,0:26:38.840
Before my deliverance, my Christian life was zero.

0:26:38.840,0:26:42.280
There was nothing to write home about concerning my Christian life.

0:26:42.280,0:26:45.240
I didn't go to church, I didn't read the Bible.

0:26:45.240,0:26:50.820
Now, I own a Bible - it's quite shocking.

0:26:50.820,0:26:57.200
I could not pray. If you asked me to pray, I would just murmur and that was the end.

0:26:57.200,0:27:05.120
But now I can pray, I get to read my Bible more - I read it daily.

0:27:05.120,0:27:07.940
It's a different thing.

0:27:07.940,0:27:12.560
Do you still have the urge to meet men like yourself?

0:27:12.560,0:27:13.840
No, sir.

0:27:13.840,0:27:16.020
I don't really have such urge.

0:27:16.020,0:27:18.640
I am free because I feel so light.

0:27:18.640,0:27:23.700
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:27:23.700,0:27:27.160
So, Mama, we welcome you, in Jesus' name.

0:27:27.160,0:27:28.680
Can you introduce yourself?

0:27:28.680,0:27:31.440
Your son has said so much about his past life,

0:27:31.440,0:27:36.680
We just want to confirm what you knew about your son in the past

0:27:36.680,0:27:42.160
and tell us what has been happening in his life before today,

0:27:42.160,0:27:44.360
now you are giving this testimony.

0:27:44.360,0:27:48.940
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:27:48.940,0:27:52.640
My name is Mrs Cassandra.

0:27:52.640,0:27:56.800
The young man standing next to me is my son.

0:27:56.800,0:28:03.280
Actually, like he said, I brought them up in a Christian way.

0:28:03.280,0:28:06.500
In a God fearing manner.

0:28:06.500,0:28:09.560
I am so surprised and shocked today

0:28:09.560,0:28:16.200
about all he has been saying.

0:28:16.200,0:28:20.860
All this confession he is making, you are hearing it for the very first time now?

0:28:20.860,0:28:25.540
Yes.

0:28:25.540,0:28:30.760
Like he said, whenever he was out of the house,

0:28:30.760,0:28:34.440
I would make sure to ask him if he prays.

0:28:34.440,0:28:38.440
Even when he went to Ghana, while he was in Accra, Ghana,

0:28:38.440,0:28:42.600
I told him that Emmanuel TV is there in Accra, Ghana,

0:28:42.600,0:28:45.700
that he should try and locate where The SCOAN was

0:28:45.700,0:28:50.920
so that he could always go there for the service.

0:28:50.920,0:28:54.080
But to no avail.

0:28:54.080,0:28:59.000
So your son was truly a bad boy in the past?

0:28:59.000,0:29:03.080
Yes, I would say that because we were formerly in Lagos here,

0:29:03.080,0:29:06.240
but when we relocated to Anambra state,

0:29:06.240,0:29:08.260
my husband bought the decoder.

0:29:08.260,0:29:10.440
And whenever we were watching Emmanuel TV,

0:29:10.440,0:29:13.300
he didn't like watching with us.

0:29:13.300,0:29:15.600
As soon as everybody went to sleep,

0:29:15.600,0:29:17.680
that is when he came to the parlor.

0:29:17.680,0:29:20.200
Or sometimes he stayed watching with us and he was sleeping.

0:29:20.200,0:29:22.460
I cautioned him many times.

0:29:22.460,0:29:25.460
As soon as everybody went to sleep,

0:29:25.460,0:29:29.400
he would tune over to those vampire films.

0:29:29.400,0:29:33.340
Sometimes when he was just playing with his siblings in the house,

0:29:33.340,0:29:38.320
he would scare them with words and animal kind of looks.

0:29:38.320,0:29:44.460
Each time when the siblings were complaining, I would complain too.

0:29:44.460,0:29:49.240
And when he went to Ghana, he did the same thing - he was not going to church.

0:29:49.240,0:29:54.440
When he finally came back here, he got admission to go back to school.

0:29:54.440,0:29:58.440
He got admission in Imo state.

0:29:58.440,0:30:02.960
While he was schooling, he was working as well.

0:30:02.960,0:30:09.220
Every time I asked him, maybe he would call to say one thing or the other -

0:30:09.220,0:30:11.240
I would ask him, if he payed his tithe.

0:30:11.240,0:30:16.660
I would tell him, "You have to tithe, if you tithe that is what you will use to hold on to God".

0:30:16.660,0:30:18.880
Because of time, can you tell us -

0:30:18.880,0:30:24.300
ever since your son has been delivered, what are the attitudes you noticed

0:30:24.300,0:30:27.200
in him since his deliverance?

0:30:27.200,0:30:30.280
After his deliverance last Sunday,

0:30:30.280,0:30:35.940
he even bought himself a Bible, he reads his Bible, he prays.

0:30:35.940,0:30:38.500
By Gods grace, he is a changed person.

0:30:38.500,0:30:40.880
And how does that make you feel as a mother?

0:30:40.880,0:30:42.740
I am happy as a mother.

0:30:42.740,0:30:48.140
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:30:48.140,0:30:55.340
Thank you. What word of advice do you have for youth like you?

0:30:55.340,0:31:00.520
Many are into the same addiction and cult activities

0:31:00.520,0:31:02.300
that you have been delivered from.

0:31:02.300,0:31:05.220
Just in a word, what advice do you have for them?

0:31:05.220,0:31:09.500
Before I give my word of advice unto the world,

0:31:09.500,0:31:13.180
I would want to use this opportunity

0:31:13.180,0:31:17.360
to plead on everybody to help me to beg my mum.

0:31:17.360,0:31:19.920
I know I have brought so much pain.

0:31:19.920,0:31:24.880
I know she is finding it difficult to believe that this is the person

0:31:24.880,0:31:27.260
she has always believed in.

0:31:27.260,0:31:30.700
I'm so sorry, mum!

0:31:30.700,0:31:34.460
Daniel & Mother - Deliverance Testimony

0:31:34.460,0:31:39.680
It's okay, I forgive you.

0:31:39.680,0:31:46.800
Mama, we just want to let you know,

0:31:46.800,0:31:50.660
on behalf of the anointed man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:31:50.660,0:31:59.860
the Bible says, if you fail to realize that demons are the ones

0:31:59.860,0:32:04.980
that cause people to be bowed down in bondage, you are fighting the wrong battle.

0:32:04.980,0:32:08.680
So all that he did in the past, he has disappointed you,

0:32:08.680,0:32:14.200
he has walked in the wrong way and lived a bad life in the past

0:32:14.200,0:32:19.600
is all as a result of this evil spirit that has tormented him,

0:32:19.600,0:32:22.840
even though he has played a role in finding himself in that.

0:32:22.840,0:32:24.880
Anyone can be a victim.

0:32:24.880,0:32:29.300
Thank God you are here today to stand side by side with your son

0:32:29.300,0:32:32.280
to testify that he is a changed person now.

0:32:32.280,0:32:35.160
So the past is over.

0:32:35.160,0:32:38.280
Your son is no longer the person he used to be,

0:32:38.280,0:32:40.940
now he is a new person in Christ Jesus.

0:32:40.940,0:32:45.320
The Bible says, "We forgive because we need to be forgiven"

0:32:45.320,0:32:49.660
and we thank God that you have forgiven your son, is that right?

0:32:49.660,0:32:52.380
Yes, I have.

0:32:52.380,0:32:57.900
So how do you show that you have forgiven your son?

0:32:57.900,0:33:03.880
Hallelujah, put your hands together for Jesus!

0:33:03.880,0:33:06.200
So we thank God for everything.

0:33:06.200,0:33:10.860
Brother, your mum has forgiven you as a Christian

0:33:10.860,0:33:15.400
and now you know that you have a role to play

0:33:15.400,0:33:19.060
to prove yourself as good child again.

0:33:19.060,0:33:23.740
And that you can only do by making the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:33:23.740,0:33:28.500
Get closer to Jesus and allow His Word to influence you.

0:33:28.500,0:33:33.760
And by so doing, your life is totally reformed and

0:33:33.760,0:33:37.080
your future in Christ Jesus is guaranteed.

0:33:37.080,0:33:42.000
And just one word of advice for people before you leave.

0:33:42.000,0:33:45.740
My word of advice to young people like me,

0:33:45.740,0:33:48.700
who have been brought up in a Christian home

0:33:48.700,0:33:52.260
and you have a mum that is close to you.

0:33:52.260,0:33:54.000
Try to talk to her.

0:33:54.000,0:33:58.600
If you find any difficulties in anything - your studies, your personal life -

0:33:58.600,0:34:01.880
it's best you open up to your parents

0:34:01.880,0:34:05.120
because they are the gods we have here on earth.

0:34:05.120,0:34:07.860
They are more like guardians to us,

0:34:07.860,0:34:12.860
they are like servants of God given to us children.

0:34:12.860,0:34:17.040
My advice to young people out there is

0:34:17.040,0:34:18.920
whatever you see out there -

0:34:18.920,0:34:23.680
like if I were out there living my life like the way I used to live

0:34:23.680,0:34:26.400
and you would want to be like me -

0:34:26.400,0:34:29.700
stop admiring people for who they are

0:34:29.700,0:34:32.400
and pray to be what God wants you to be.

0:34:32.400,0:34:36.280
Thank you. Let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:34:36.280,0:34:39.180
Thank you very much. That says it all.

0:34:39.180,0:34:42.240
Stop admiring people on the outside

0:34:42.240,0:34:45.600
for who they are, or what they are,

0:34:45.600,0:34:49.780
but just try to be what God wants you to be.

0:34:49.780,0:34:52.440
We congratulate you for this deliverance

0:34:52.440,0:34:55.680
and we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace

0:34:55.680,0:34:58.340
to make the Word of God the standard for your life

0:34:58.340,0:35:02.220
and we believe that you are coming back to give a greater testimony

0:35:02.220,0:35:04.980
of what God Almighty will begin to do in your life,

0:35:04.980,0:35:08.440
your future and career through this deliverance, in Jesus' name.

0:35:08.440,0:35:10.440
Amen.
