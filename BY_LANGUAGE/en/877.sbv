0:00:00.340,0:00:04.220
Sitting in a car  waiting to be attended to

0:00:04.220,0:00:12.020
is a man who was brought to The SCOAN in a debilitating condition.

0:00:12.020,0:00:14.880
He sits almost motionless

0:00:14.880,0:00:21.580
and is seen wearing a neck collar and a contraption around his body is a lumbar corset,

0:00:21.580,0:00:26.600
which he is wearing as another form of support.

0:00:26.600,0:00:31.760
These support devices give us some clue to his medical condition,

0:00:31.760,0:00:38.440
which is the reason why he has come to The SCOAN.

0:00:38.440,0:00:43.800
Taking a look at the placard he is holding, which outlines the problem he is having,

0:00:43.800,0:00:48.640
we can see that he is suffering from paralysis of the whole body

0:00:48.640,0:00:51.600
due to hernia of the spine.

0:00:51.600,0:00:56.460
As the camera zooms in, we can take a look at the medical report

0:00:56.460,0:01:01.500
that he has brought with him, which shows the exact problem he is having.

0:01:01.500,0:01:05.740
This is the medical report he has brought with him from his country.

0:01:05.740,0:01:09.060
Note that it is not written in English.

0:01:09.060,0:01:13.520
The medical report states that he is having a hernia in the spine

0:01:13.520,0:01:20.220
and states the exact area in his back which has been affected, causing the paralysis.

0:01:20.220,0:01:23.620
This is a scan that he has also brought along with him,

0:01:23.620,0:01:27.120
which further shows the medical problem he is having.

0:01:27.120,0:01:31.660
After trying to find a solution to his problem - all to no avail -

0:01:31.660,0:01:39.720
he has come to The SCOAN, desperate to see an end to his nine-year bondage.

0:01:39.720,0:01:41.460
Let us hear from him.

0:01:41.460,0:01:43.820
Brother, you are welcome to The SCOAN.

0:01:43.820,0:01:46.240
Please tell us your name and where you are from.

0:01:46.240,0:01:48.320
My name is Mohammed Ali Jichy.

0:01:48.320,0:01:50.940
I am from Lebanon.

0:01:50.940,0:01:52.940
I am 30 years old.

0:01:52.940,0:01:57.200
You are welcome, sir. Can you tell us the problems that have brought you here to The SCOAN today.

0:01:57.200,0:02:06.900
I have paralysis of the whole body due to hernia of the spine.

0:02:06.900,0:02:12.840
I also have an enlarged liver and an enlarged spleen.

0:02:12.840,0:02:15.640
For how many years have you suffered from these problems?

0:02:15.640,0:02:19.780
It started in 2008 - now going to nine years.

0:02:19.780,0:02:25.440
Ok. Sir, can you tell us how these problems began in your life. How did it start nine years ago?

0:02:25.440,0:02:34.120
I was just moving and I felt a pain in my legs and in my back.

0:02:34.120,0:02:37.860
After that, I went to do some tests. I went to many hospitals.

0:02:37.860,0:02:43.260
It just began with a severe pain, and this pain just became worse and worse as it went on?

0:02:43.260,0:02:45.900
It is so bad that I can't sleep at night.

0:02:45.900,0:02:52.000
I can't lie on my back. I can't relax my head on the floor.

0:02:52.000,0:02:56.220
I can't sleep well. I can't walk. It has given me many problems in my life.

0:02:56.220,0:02:57.680
My body  paralysed.

0:02:57.680,0:03:05.340
I can't move my neck. I can't turn left or right. I can't lift my head up or down.

0:03:05.340,0:03:07.060
Even my back - I can't bend.

0:03:07.060,0:03:10.860
My waist - I can't bend down to pick something from the floor; I can't do anything.

0:03:10.860,0:03:12.980
I can't really feel my body.

0:03:12.980,0:03:15.900
What did the doctor say about this problem?

0:03:15.900,0:03:20.460
Some of them say that the cause is from a disc in my lower back.

0:03:20.460,0:03:24.040
Some of them say that I need an operation.

0:03:24.040,0:03:27.300
I went to many doctors.

0:03:27.300,0:03:30.620
Where have you travelled to because of this problem  trying to  find a solution?

0:03:30.620,0:03:35.040
I went to Lebanon - my country. I went to the biggest hospitals.

0:03:35.040,0:03:41.680
Even in Nigeria, where I went, I saw many doctors but I was not able to get a solution.

0:03:41.680,0:03:44.420
So medically, they couldn't find any solution to this problem?

0:03:44.420,0:03:46.780
They just advised you to go for an operation?

0:03:46.780,0:03:48.180
Yes, that is it.

0:03:48.180,0:03:50.400
They are just giving me painkillers.

0:03:50.400,0:03:52.620
You are taking painkillers?

0:03:52.620,0:03:55.280
I am living with painkillers; that is how I am living.

0:03:55.280,0:03:59.820
Every day, I must take a tablet.

0:03:59.820,0:04:04.160
So, even for you to come here today, you had to take painkiller tablets?

0:04:04.160,0:04:06.360
Every morning, I do that.

0:04:06.360,0:04:08.740
How did you find out about this church?

0:04:08.740,0:04:14.720
My friend, Mr Gabriel, was concerned about me.

0:04:14.720,0:04:20.180
I complained to him every time that I am having pain - my body is paining me.

0:04:20.180,0:04:26.600
I went to many hospitals and had tests done but there was no result.

0:04:26.600,0:04:34.700
My friend told me that there was a channel called Emmanuel TV, that I should be watching it.

0:04:34.700,0:04:42.420
Then, I started watching it, day by day for the last two months, up to now.

0:04:42.420,0:04:46.900
Then, we decided to come here today for me to receive my healing.

0:04:46.900,0:04:51.440
I am a muslim. My name is Mohammed.

0:04:51.440,0:04:55.400
You decided to come to The SCOAN, believing God for your healing?

0:04:55.400,0:04:57.660
Sure, I believe in God for healing.

0:04:57.660,0:05:00.340
And now that you are here, sir, at The SCOAN

0:05:00.340,0:05:04.940
what do you believe that God Almighty would do for you through Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:05:04.940,0:05:07.220
I believe that God will heal me.

0:05:07.220,0:05:10.760
Amen. We believe with you too that indeed, you will be healed.

0:05:10.760,0:05:15.600
Sir, we can see that as you are here, you are using some devices

0:05:15.600,0:05:18.180
which are obviously were uncomfortable.

0:05:18.180,0:05:21.300
Can you describe to us what it is that you are using now.

0:05:21.300,0:05:26.040
It is a neck support, so I would not feel the pain.

0:05:26.040,0:05:29.140
It is not a cure; it is just a support.

0:05:29.140,0:05:33.360
Even this (lumbar corset) is because in my lower back, there is a serious pain.

0:05:33.360,0:05:35.380
It can just assist to reduce the pain a little.

0:05:35.380,0:05:39.180
I am suffering from much pain; I can't sleep.

0:05:39.180,0:05:41.160
We know that you came here with some people.

0:05:41.160,0:05:43.580
Who are the people that accompanied you here today?

0:05:43.580,0:05:46.920
Mr Gabriel and Mrs Blessing.

0:05:46.920,0:05:51.980
Mr Gabriel is working in our company.

0:05:51.980,0:05:54.340
I am his boss but he is also my friend.

0:05:54.340,0:06:00.980
Mr Mohammed Ali Jichy's situation is so severe that he is basically immobile,

0:06:00.980,0:06:03.320
unable to move his body freely,

0:06:03.320,0:06:06.440
unable to do normal daily activities,

0:06:06.440,0:06:09.340
and unable to get a good night's sleep,

0:06:09.340,0:06:13.300
owing to the accompanying pain and discomfort he is in.

0:06:13.300,0:06:17.220
Imprisoned by his condition of paralysis of the whole body,

0:06:17.220,0:06:23.880
among other conditions, The SCOAN is his last bus stop.

0:06:23.880,0:06:29.240
This is the medication that has been prescribed to him by his doctor for short-term relief

0:06:29.240,0:06:35.380
to help him cope with the severe pain and discomfort he experiences on a daily basis.

0:06:35.380,0:06:37.560
There are different kinds of medications.

0:06:37.560,0:06:40.620
This is the injection.

0:06:40.620,0:06:44.040
Can you explain to us how you would use this, sir.

0:06:44.040,0:06:47.360
I have to take it daily. This is the one I inject.

0:06:47.360,0:06:50.640
Why would you have to inject this into your muscle, sir?

0:06:50.640,0:06:56.580
It can make me feel better - to reduce the pain just for some time.

0:06:56.580,0:06:59.120
It is not a cure.

0:06:59.120,0:07:03.300
Even upon all of this medication you are taking, the problem still continued?

0:07:03.300,0:07:06.160
It still continues. I can't move.

0:07:06.160,0:07:09.500
I can't move because of the pain.

0:07:09.500,0:07:13.160
Once again, sir, now that you are here, what do you believe God will do for you?

0:07:13.160,0:07:16.100
I will be healed, in Jesus' name.

0:07:16.100,0:07:16.940
Amen.

0:07:16.940,0:07:18.940
My name is Gabriel.

0:07:18.940,0:07:27.260
The person next to me is my lovely wife and the other person is my younger brother.

0:07:27.260,0:07:32.300
He is my boss in the office. Every day, he complains about his pain

0:07:32.300,0:07:34.700
and based on this, he has travelled out of the country.

0:07:34.700,0:07:39.480
He went to Lebanon and he told me that he went to the biggest hospital in Lebanon.

0:07:39.480,0:07:42.360
He did so many tests and when he came back, he showed me all the tests he had done.

0:07:42.360,0:07:48.340
He even has a CD based on his ailment. When I saw all this, I said to him,

0:07:48.340,0:07:52.900
"There is a place you need to go to that is called The SCOAN".

0:07:52.900,0:07:57.960
He told me that his name was Mohammed and that based on his religion,

0:07:57.960,0:08:00.360
he had not visited any church before.

0:08:00.360,0:08:05.480
I told him that the man of God does not care where you come from or what your religion is,

0:08:05.480,0:08:07.760
that he takes care of everybody.

0:08:07.760,0:08:17.520
So, each day, based on this, he decided to have Emmanuel TV on his mobile phone.

0:08:17.520,0:08:19.200
Every day, he would watch it.

0:08:19.200,0:08:21.500
In the morning, he would come and the first thing I would do was to ask him,

0:08:21.500,0:08:23.040
how he was feeling.

0:08:23.040,0:08:27.420
He would reply that he could not sleep and that if not for the pain-relieving medication he took,

0:08:27.420,0:08:29.600
he would not have been able to come to work.

0:08:29.600,0:08:33.040
I told him that we should please try the hand of God.

0:08:33.040,0:08:41.440
On Friday, he told me, "Gabriel, I have made up my mind. I will go with you to that living church".

0:08:41.440,0:08:43.680
So, that was why we came here today.

0:08:43.680,0:08:48.020
And now that you have brought him here, sir, what do you believe that Jesus Christ is going to do for him?

0:08:48.020,0:08:54.860
I believe totally that he will be healed today and that he is going to testify to the glory of God.

0:08:54.860,0:08:58.040
Amen. We believe with you too that Jesus Christ will indeed heal our brother

0:08:58.040,0:09:00.500
and set him free completely from this paralysis of the whole body

0:09:00.500,0:09:03.880
due to the hernia and spine, alongside the enlarged liver and spleen.

0:09:03.880,0:09:08.900
We believe that our brother here, alongside this family, will be coming back with wonderful testimonies,

0:09:08.900,0:09:10.480
in Jesus' name.

0:09:10.480,0:09:12.480
Amen.

0:09:12.480,0:09:17.220
HEALING TIME

0:09:17.220,0:09:22.320
During a Sunday service, as Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer to the congregation,

0:09:22.320,0:09:26.940
he is led by the Spirit of God to respond to a cry coming from outside.

0:09:26.940,0:09:31.160
Man of God, help my boss! He cannot walk; he has pain!

0:09:31.160,0:09:35.440
He has paralysis of the whole body.

0:09:35.440,0:09:40.080
Man of God, please help! I have had paralysis for nine years!

0:09:40.080,0:09:45.020
I have back pain and leg pain, all over my body. I can't walk; I can't sleep well.

0:09:45.020,0:09:52.300
You recognise Jesus as Healer, Saviour and Deliverer?

0:09:52.300,0:09:54.180
He proceeds to pray for him.

0:09:54.180,0:10:03.780
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:10:03.780,0:10:07.420
Come on! Leave the place!

0:10:07.420,0:10:21.540
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:10:21.540,0:10:24.940
As the lightning power of God moves through Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:10:24.940,0:10:27.540
something extraordinary takes place.

0:10:27.540,0:10:30.080
Stand up and walk!

0:10:30.080,0:10:32.880
Don't help him; he will stand up by himself.

0:10:32.880,0:10:34.080
Go!

0:10:34.080,0:10:37.160
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:10:37.160,0:10:39.640
Thank You, Jesus!

0:10:39.640,0:10:44.920
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:10:44.920,0:10:52.480
Honour be to Jesus! Honour be to Him!

0:10:52.480,0:11:01.440
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:11:01.440,0:11:03.000
He's my husband's boss.

0:11:03.000,0:11:06.120
He could not walk. He could not do anything.

0:11:06.120,0:11:13.720
Even in his office, he was paralysed and always on drugs - every minute, every second.

0:11:13.720,0:11:18.100
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:11:18.100,0:11:20.100
Thank You, Jesus!

0:11:20.100,0:11:22.260
Thank You, Jesus, I can move my head!

0:11:22.260,0:11:28.300
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:11:28.300,0:11:32.520
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:11:32.520,0:11:36.140
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:11:36.140,0:11:40.820
What an incredible transformation in the life of our brother!

0:11:40.820,0:11:44.200
Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!

0:11:44.200,0:11:49.200
Testimony Time

0:11:49.200,0:11:52.340
Right now, we want to use the opportunity to listen to him.

0:11:52.340,0:11:59.320
We believe his testimony will greatly bless the people of God present here and our viewers all over the world.

0:11:59.320,0:12:00.760
So, brother, you are very welcome.

0:12:00.760,0:12:06.900
Please introduce yourself to us - tell us your name, where you're from and the people beside you.

0:12:06.900,0:12:10.120
My name is Mohammed Ali Jichy.

0:12:10.120,0:12:13.980
I am from Lebanon. My age is 30 years. I'm a Muslim.

0:12:13.980,0:12:18.300
This is Mr Gabriel and this is his wife - Mrs Blessing.

0:12:18.300,0:12:20.700
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:12:20.700,0:12:26.340
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was having paralysis of the whole body.

0:12:26.340,0:12:29.000
I couldn't sleep well; I couldn't walk.

0:12:29.000,0:12:32.200
I couldn't bend over to pick up something on the floor.

0:12:32.200,0:12:35.760
I was paralysed.

0:12:35.760,0:12:43.580
I went to many doctors. It was in 2008 that I started having the problem.

0:12:43.580,0:12:48.980
I went to many doctors and hospitals outside the country as well as here in Nigeria

0:12:48.980,0:12:50.980
but there was no solution.

0:12:50.980,0:12:57.520
They were just giving me pain killers, injections in my muscles and injections in my spine.

0:12:57.520,0:12:59.820
It was just pain killers.

0:12:59.820,0:13:04.680
It was then they gave me a neck collar and body brace.

0:13:04.680,0:13:12.680
All of that was not a cure; it was just so I could manage.

0:13:12.680,0:13:16.500
I was complaining all the time to Mr Gabriel that I had body pain.

0:13:16.500,0:13:19.640
I had serious body pain; I could not sleep well.

0:13:19.640,0:13:23.900
I couldn't walk well; I couldn't do anything.

0:13:23.900,0:13:27.120
He said that I should watch Emmanuel TV.

0:13:27.120,0:13:32.260
I began watching; I watched Emmanuel TV for two months.

0:13:32.260,0:13:38.520
It touched me and I said I wanted to come to the church

0:13:38.520,0:13:44.920
but I wasn't sure if they would attend to me because I'm a Muslim.

0:13:44.920,0:13:48.420
But God did it for me; I am healed now.

0:13:48.420,0:13:52.100
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:13:52.100,0:13:53.520
Wow! Glory be to God Almighty!

0:13:53.520,0:13:57.100
Sir, before you explain what happened when you came here,

0:13:57.100,0:14:03.020
what did you see on Emmanuel TV that really encouraged you to come?

0:14:03.020,0:14:10.760
I saw a lady who had cancer and all her hair had fallen out

0:14:10.760,0:14:12.980
and she had body pain and all the rest.

0:14:12.980,0:14:19.360
She came back after four years to give her testimony; she was healed!

0:14:19.360,0:14:20.800
Thank God!

0:14:20.800,0:14:24.780
So when you saw this testimony of someone with cancer that received her healing,

0:14:24.780,0:14:28.660
that inspired you to also come to The SCOAN?

0:14:28.660,0:14:32.540
It encouraged me to come to The SCOAN.

0:14:32.540,0:14:37.120
So when you told your colleague in the office - the person working with you - Mr Gabriel,

0:14:37.120,0:14:42.900
what did you tell him when you said you wanted to come to the church?

0:14:42.900,0:14:49.440
I said that I wanted to go to The SCOAN

0:14:49.440,0:14:55.360
but I didn't know if they would attend to me because I was not a Christian.

0:14:55.360,0:15:00.740
But he told me that the church would attend to me

0:15:00.740,0:15:06.100
and that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, does not discriminate between Muslim and Christian

0:15:06.100,0:15:10.360
or whoever you are, so, I came.

0:15:10.360,0:15:14.620
We thank God that you came, sir, realising that this is an arena of liberty

0:15:14.620,0:15:17.980
where the love of God is obviously the most important thing.

0:15:17.980,0:15:21.380
When you came, sir, we saw on the screen just earlier

0:15:21.380,0:15:23.960
when Prophet T.B. Joshua began to pray for you,

0:15:23.960,0:15:28.060
tell us - what happened to you when he prayed for you?

0:15:28.060,0:15:30.320
I can't explain that, really.

0:15:30.320,0:15:33.800
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:15:33.800,0:15:36.500
It was a wonderful feeling. I can't explain it; I don't know how.

0:15:36.500,0:15:40.200
It was the Spirit of God; that is all I can say.

0:15:40.200,0:15:44.120
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:15:44.120,0:15:49.240
Sir, we just saw that your body was actually shaking; you fell down.

0:15:49.240,0:15:52.600
Do you remember at all what was happening to you at that moment?

0:15:52.600,0:15:54.460
I can't remember anything.

0:15:54.460,0:15:56.860
I just felt my body vibrating.

0:15:56.860,0:15:58.860
Then, I don't know.

0:15:58.860,0:16:04.320
Wow, that is the power of God Almighty through Prophet T.B. Joshua that touched our brother!

0:16:04.320,0:16:09.960
Ever since then, sir, what are the changes you have seen in your life?

0:16:09.960,0:16:14.080
I haven't taken a single drug since Sunday.

0:16:14.080,0:16:20.320
From the time the man of God prayed and God healed me, I have not taken drugs or injections

0:16:20.320,0:16:25.340
or used the neck collar or body brace.

0:16:25.340,0:16:30.360
Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:16:30.360,0:16:32.900
You mean to say, sir, that you have returned to work,

0:16:32.900,0:16:39.140
you're back to your work, you're walking normally, everything about you is back to normal?

0:16:39.140,0:16:43.180
It's back to normal; glory to God! Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:43.180,0:16:47.980
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:16:47.980,0:16:50.840
Hallelujah! We thank God Almighty for what He has done in our brother's life!

0:16:50.840,0:16:57.020
Sir, apart from the physical healing you received, what other changes have you witnessed in your life?

0:16:57.020,0:17:00.460
I am close to Jesus, more and more.

0:17:00.460,0:17:02.120
Thank You, Jesus!

0:17:02.120,0:17:07.000
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:17:07.000,0:17:12.000
After my healing, I am closer to Jesus!

0:17:12.000,0:17:13.600
Amen!

0:17:13.600,0:17:17.720
Wow! We thank God Almighty for what he has done in our brother's life.

0:17:17.720,0:17:20.700
Can you just explain to us, sir - you mentioned in the interview earlier

0:17:20.700,0:17:23.180
that because the pain was so severe,

0:17:23.180,0:17:26.920
it really even affected your relationship with others;

0:17:26.920,0:17:31.100
it caused you to get very angry easily because of the severity of the pain.

0:17:31.100,0:17:35.020
Just tell us - what are the changes that you have seen in that area?

0:17:35.020,0:17:38.060
There is no more hot temper; I am friends with everybody.

0:17:38.060,0:17:41.000
Thank You, Jesus!

0:17:41.000,0:17:42.440
Wow! Thank God Almighty!

0:17:42.440,0:17:44.820
Not only did our brother receive physical healing;

0:17:44.820,0:17:49.120
he was also set free from that spirit that pushed him to get very angry

0:17:49.120,0:17:50.420
and we give glory to God.

0:17:50.420,0:17:53.520
Now, for the glory of God, sir, we would like to see you demonstrate

0:17:53.520,0:17:56.880
what you can now do that you couldn't do before.

0:17:56.880,0:18:11.120
Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body

0:18:11.120,0:18:14.380
Wow! This is something that was impossible for our brother to do before!

0:18:14.380,0:18:19.040
But you can see him today - a living testimony to the glory of God.

0:18:19.040,0:18:20.840
We thank God for what He has done in your life, sir.

0:18:20.840,0:18:24.820
We just want to hear a word from our brother that really encouraged you to be here

0:18:24.820,0:18:27.560
and introduced you to Emmanuel TV.

0:18:27.560,0:18:29.780
Good Morning, Church!

0:18:29.780,0:18:34.280
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:18:34.280,0:18:38.120
My name is Mr Gabriel.

0:18:38.120,0:18:45.520
The man next to me is my boss and my friend and the lady is my wife.

0:18:45.520,0:18:54.680
Last Sunday, we came here with my friend, and he was really feeling bad.

0:18:54.680,0:19:00.920
The pain was too much so we had to cry to the man of God.

0:19:00.920,0:19:06.560
To the glory of God, what we came for was fulfilled.

0:19:06.560,0:19:09.880
I give God the glory.

0:19:09.880,0:19:14.380
Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:19:14.380,0:19:15.700
We thank God Almighty!

0:19:15.700,0:19:19.460
Sir, as someone that worked very closely with Mr Mohammed,

0:19:19.460,0:19:23.820
can you just tell us a little bit about before - how this problem really affected him

0:19:23.820,0:19:28.620
and then the changes you have seen in his life after the prayer.

0:19:28.620,0:19:32.480
Before, he was always very aggressive.

0:19:32.480,0:19:35.980
Most of the time, people pass through me to him

0:19:35.980,0:19:41.180
because they see me as a more or less ADC to him.

0:19:41.180,0:19:47.640
When that pain was on - except me that understands him very well...

0:19:47.640,0:19:53.540
He is not a bad man or wicked person.

0:19:53.540,0:20:00.100
To the glory of God, after we left this place, on Monday, a boy that was punished,

0:20:00.100,0:20:02.720
when he came to work, he now asked him to call him.

0:20:02.720,0:20:04.800
When I heard that, I was so excited.

0:20:04.800,0:20:10.680
One thing I learnt here, there is a lot of love.

0:20:10.680,0:20:17.060
Even the workers - from the workers to the man of God - they are lovely.

0:20:17.060,0:20:24.860
I believe that anybody who enters here and doesn't have that change of being loved -

0:20:24.860,0:20:26.900
I think he has to go somewhere else.

0:20:26.900,0:20:32.780
When we went to work on Monday, there was a boy that he punished.

0:20:32.780,0:20:35.860
Just for a trial, the boy decided to come.

0:20:35.860,0:20:39.360
So when he came, he said, "Go back to your work!"

0:20:39.360,0:20:42.880
There are other things that normally happened to him.

0:20:42.880,0:20:47.520
He always told me that he never dreamt.

0:20:47.520,0:20:51.540
But on that day, after we left this place on Sunday,

0:20:51.540,0:20:55.420
when I came to work on Monday, he was laughing and told me,

0:20:55.420,0:20:57.320
"Mr Gabriel, do you know what?"

0:20:57.320,0:20:58.520
I said, "What is it?"

0:20:58.520,0:21:05.540
He said, "I dreamt last night and I was telling God 'Thank You, Jesus!'".

0:21:05.540,0:21:13.440
Even when he woke up, he was still saying it, "Thank You, Jesus!".

0:21:13.440,0:21:18.960
Hallelujah! One more time, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:21:18.960,0:21:24.080
Now we thank God for this wonderful testimony we have just listened to from our brother here.

0:21:24.080,0:21:28.400
Once again, when we listen to testimonies, it is important that we learn valuable lessons

0:21:28.400,0:21:31.020
from the contents of those testimonies.

0:21:31.020,0:21:36.340
We learnt from our brother here that one of the things that really impacted our brother

0:21:36.340,0:21:41.000
from coming to The SCOAN was seeing the fruit of the Spirit in action -

0:21:41.000,0:21:43.760
the love of God in action.

0:21:43.760,0:21:48.940
As we remember recently when Prophet T.B. Joshua actually visited the nation of Israel,

0:21:48.940,0:21:54.380
we saw in the clips how he held a meeting with religious leaders of different faiths -

0:21:54.380,0:21:58.420
religious leaders from Judaism, Islam, Christianity.

0:21:58.420,0:22:05.720
During that meeting, Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "The love of God transcends all religion,

0:22:05.720,0:22:11.480
any geographical barrier or any ethnic barrier".

0:22:11.480,0:22:17.200
We believe it was the love of God that our brother received when he came to The SCOAN

0:22:17.200,0:22:20.320
and we can see the fruit in his life thereafter.

0:22:20.320,0:22:25.420
How upon going back to work on Monday, many of the people that he had sacked previously

0:22:25.420,0:22:29.060
he called them back and allowed them to come back to work

0:22:29.060,0:22:32.600
because of that same love of God Almighty.

0:22:32.600,0:22:34.960
So, once again, this is a lesson for all of us.

0:22:34.960,0:22:37.540
As we have heard Prophet T.B. Joshua preaching regularly -

0:22:37.540,0:22:42.140
even last Sunday, he said, "When you hold an offence against a brother,

0:22:42.140,0:22:45.060
you have already grieved the Holy Spirit".

0:22:45.060,0:22:49.520
After not only receiving physical healing but spiritual healing,

0:22:49.520,0:22:54.440
our brother here - Mr Mohammed - actually wanted to make sure he let go of all offence,

0:22:54.440,0:22:57.280
let go of all bitterness or pain of the past

0:22:57.280,0:23:03.120
and actually forgive and reconcile with the people that he had sent out from his office

0:23:03.120,0:23:05.760
as the brother, Mr Gabriel, just explained.

0:23:05.760,0:23:09.340
So this is God. This is the name of Jesus Christ that we are talking about.

0:23:09.340,0:23:11.880
It is not only in physically calling the name.

0:23:11.880,0:23:16.540
Today, some people would be calling the name in a way to try and cause division,

0:23:16.540,0:23:20.820
or try and spread problems between people of different religions.

0:23:20.820,0:23:23.880
But the name of Jesus Christ must bring results,

0:23:23.880,0:23:28.040
must be followed by the corresponding power.

0:23:28.040,0:23:32.540
We have seen in the life of our brother now that he did not only receive physical healing

0:23:32.540,0:23:36.560
spiritual healing but you have seen how his life has also changed thereafter

0:23:36.560,0:23:39.900
and the fruits of the Spirit have started to show in his life.

0:23:39.900,0:23:45.460
So one more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:23:45.460,0:23:49.760
We would just like to ask our brother a final question.

0:23:49.760,0:23:53.380
What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?

0:23:53.380,0:24:00.100
My advice to anyone who has a problem, like my problem or not like my problem,

0:24:00.100,0:24:01.840
any problem you have,

0:24:01.840,0:24:07.400
all healing, all blessing - receive your healing, in Jesus' name!

0:24:07.400,0:24:10.180
