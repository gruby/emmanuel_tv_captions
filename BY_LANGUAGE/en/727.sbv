Viewers all over the world , I am here with instructions from JESUS to you.

0:04:58.560,0:05:09.480
let us open Matthew 5:8.

0:05:09.480,0:05:19.720
Matthew 5:8
"Blessed are those pure in heart, for they will see God."

0:05:19.720,0:05:36.040
This means if we regard iniquity, sin, wrong in our heart the Lord will not hear our prayer.

0:05:36.040,0:05:46.540
If you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.

0:05:46.540,0:05:49.640
you have already grieved GOD

0:05:49.640,0:05:58.280
Viewers all over the world, this means our heart is the temple; our heart is the prayer room.

0:05:58.280,0:06:02.200
Give me your heart!

0:06:10.740,0:06:12.740

Grudges, strife, outrage, bitterness, pain of the past, an unforgiving spirit, hatred.

0:06:35.420,0:06:44.920

0:07:26.520,0:07:28.960
Hallelujah!

0:07:28.960,0:07:38.780
liberty in prayer can only be obtained where there is a right atmosphere

0:07:38.780,0:07:46.320
That atmosphere can be one of unity and harmony.

0:07:46.320,0:07:52.720

0:07:52.720,0:08:00.560
Be removed, in the name of Jesus  Christ!

0:08:00.560,0:08:07.480
The year 2017 - I don't know time you are in your nation, your continent -

0:08:07.480,0:08:09.840
God's time is the best.

0:08:09.840,0:08:20.240

Just trust and believe.

0:09:01.380,0:09:10.500
Hear GOD say to you, "The voice of wailing shall be silenced";

0:09:10.500,0:09:16.780
Listen, "The voice of difficulty shall be silenced;

0:09:16.780,0:09:23.700
the voice of setback and hardship shall be silenced."

0:09:23.700,0:09:30.920
