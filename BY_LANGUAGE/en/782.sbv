0:00:00.100,0:00:01.700
Good morning, Church.

0:00:01.700,0:00:07.100
[Good morning.]

0:00:07.100,0:00:15.220
You are very good in receiving prayer but you are not good after the prayer.

0:00:15.220,0:00:31.080
Tell your neighbour, "You are a good Christian in receiving but after receiving, a very bad Christian".

0:00:31.080,0:00:33.120
I'm telling you.

0:00:33.120,0:00:36.540
Can you see the way you have been dancing?

0:00:36.540,0:00:38.880
And now you sit quietly.

0:00:38.880,0:00:46.100
You are very good in waiting upon the Lord but when the Lord now comes,

0:00:46.100,0:00:49.380
you are not good when God leaves.

0:00:49.380,0:01:03.580
Once you are touched, it must be followed by absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer -

0:01:03.580,0:01:12.940
no more anxiety or worry as if you never prayed at all.

0:01:12.940,0:01:15.880
Before you are touched, you know what you prayed for.

0:01:15.880,0:01:21.240
Once you are touched - absolute trust.

0:01:21.240,0:01:23.460
In whom?

0:01:23.460,0:01:31.240
In that process, there is no anxiety, worry or tension.

0:01:31.240,0:01:35.140
Leave it for God once you are touched.

0:01:35.140,0:01:47.340
But if, after the touching, you are still worried as if you had never prayed at all, it is a waste.

0:01:47.340,0:01:50.540
Such a touch is a waste.

0:01:50.540,0:01:55.980
Christians all over the world today only know how to ask for prayer

0:01:55.980,0:01:59.860
but after the prayer they don't know what to do next.

0:01:59.860,0:02:12.700
That is why you see them fall into anxiety and full of worry as if they never prayed at all.

0:02:12.700,0:02:20.520
You have diabetes, and the doctor had given you a tablet you must take regularly,

0:02:20.520,0:02:25.900
and you are here in The SCOAN sitting down with the tablet inside your pocket

0:02:25.900,0:02:27.620
because anything can happen.

0:02:27.620,0:02:34.600
You believe you would collapse without your tablet.

0:02:34.600,0:02:35.860
You are holding your tablet.

0:02:35.860,0:02:45.760
After the prayer, you begin to ask yourself, "Would I use my tablet again, or should I not use my tablet?"

0:02:45.760,0:02:51.020
I need to see the man of God and ask him whether I should still use my tablet or not.

0:02:51.020,0:02:52.920
Let me tell you what Jesus says.

0:02:52.920,0:03:08.600
Jesus says if you don't trust Him with your tablets, you can never trust Him without your tablets.

0:03:08.600,0:03:19.800
If you don't trust Jesus with your tablets, you cannot trust Him without your tablets.

0:03:19.800,0:03:24.660
It is a wisdom - a deep one.

0:03:24.660,0:03:30.280
Eighty percent of us sitting here have a tablet in the pocket.

0:03:30.280,0:03:33.640
Hypertension - a very common condition.

0:03:33.640,0:03:40.120
When I was touching a man there, he fell down; his hypertension tablet dropped on the floor.

0:03:40.120,0:03:41.520
You know what happened?

0:03:41.520,0:03:49.260
When he fell down, immediately I left the place, he collected back his tablet.

0:03:49.260,0:03:50.580
He quickly run.

0:03:50.580,0:03:53.800
I was looking.

0:03:53.800,0:04:00.340
The first thing he did after standing up was grabbing his tablet and putting it in his pocket.

0:04:00.340,0:04:01.540
Why?

0:04:01.540,0:04:06.700
"In case I'm not healed."

0:04:06.700,0:04:10.360
"I don't want to die."

0:04:10.360,0:04:15.080
You know it is very difficult to trust something you receive for free.

0:04:15.080,0:04:19.580
Something you receive for free is the most difficult thing to trust.

0:04:19.580,0:04:29.020
A man just looks at you and says, "I give you this Laser Jeep of 25 million".

0:04:29.020,0:04:33.120
"I don't know this man. I have never met him before and he gives me this!"

0:04:33.120,0:04:36.480
You can never believe.

0:04:36.480,0:04:41.720
You only believe someone whom you have served, in one way or another -

0:04:41.720,0:04:46.700
he's sent you for an errand, you have done something for him in the past, you have helped him in the past.

0:04:46.700,0:04:53.100
If he gives you such a Laser Jeep, you cannot doubt it.

0:04:53.100,0:04:59.440
When Jesus heals you, He heals you perpetually, freely.

0:04:59.440,0:05:06.820
It is always difficult to believe, compared to where you spent millions, a fortune.

0:05:06.820,0:05:11.480
But when Jesus just touches and heals you, it is always difficult to believe.

0:05:11.480,0:05:13.180
It takes the grace of God.

0:05:13.180,0:05:15.800
Take this proverb - it will help you.

0:05:15.800,0:05:25.820
If you cannot trust Jesus with your tablets, you cannot trust Him without your tablets.

0:05:25.820,0:05:27.240
There is a way Jesus does things.

0:05:27.240,0:05:30.900
It is not you that would ask Jesus whether you should use the tablet or not.

0:05:30.900,0:05:35.080
If you don't believe Him with your tablets, you cannot believe Him without the tablets.

0:05:35.080,0:05:42.740
If Jesus doesn't want you to use it again, you will just naturally forget it - it will be absent.

0:05:42.740,0:05:50.400
The following days you will not remember taking your tablets - you will naturally forget it.

0:05:50.400,0:05:51.720
That is how Jesus works.

0:05:51.720,0:05:53.480
Jesus has a way of working.

0:05:53.480,0:05:56.080
If you understand me - let me see your hand.

0:05:56.080,0:06:03.040
Look, something you take regularly; something will remind you -

0:06:03.040,0:06:11.300
it is either your blood pressure that rises, having headache, having a dry tongue,

0:06:11.300,0:06:15.180
or you find yourself going frequently to the toilet.

0:06:15.180,0:06:19.440
There are many signs that would remind you that you have to take your tablets.

0:06:19.440,0:06:26.000
But in this case, you just forget your tablet because your life seems to be normal.

0:06:26.000,0:06:34.480
After some days you realise that you have not been taking your tablets.

0:06:34.480,0:06:39.940
It is Jesus that is working.

0:06:39.940,0:06:45.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:45.440,0:06:53.900
He has the ability to block the sense of your memory if all the symptoms you had cease.

0:06:53.900,0:07:02.820
It is when there are symptoms - your body is warm, you have headache, your throat is dry, you cannot sleep -

0:07:02.820,0:07:06.240
that will remind you about your drugs.

0:07:06.240,0:07:09.400
Healing does not just come without a message.

0:07:09.400,0:07:12.500
Healing and deliverance come with a message.

0:07:12.500,0:07:18.600
If you have not been grounded in the Word and you receive healing, you will likely loose the healing.

0:07:18.600,0:07:21.740
Tell your neighbour.

0:07:21.740,0:07:29.580
If you have not been grounded in the Word of healing and you receive healing,

0:07:29.580,0:07:35.040
you are likely to lose the healing.

0:07:35.040,0:07:39.220
That is, if you have not received a message concerning that healing.

0:07:39.220,0:07:41.420
Message is maintenance.

0:07:41.420,0:07:47.380
It is like giving you a car without teaching you how to maintain it.

0:07:47.380,0:07:55.820
You just received a car, a brand new car, and you are ignorant about maintenance - how to wash the car,

0:07:55.820,0:08:01.520
how to change the tyres - you don't know anything about it.

0:08:01.520,0:08:05.580
It means that this vehicle will soon knock down.

0:08:05.580,0:08:10.640
You must have thorough knowledge of how to maintain that vehicle.

0:08:10.640,0:08:25.320
You must be grounded in the Word to maintain healing, salvation and deliverance.

0:08:25.320,0:08:29.840
The top challenge we are facing is simple.

0:08:29.840,0:08:35.500
I make the Word first place.

0:08:35.500,0:08:39.340
I exalt the Word of God.

0:08:39.340,0:08:45.140
I make it first place.

0:08:45.140,0:08:49.480
I make my schedule around the Word of God.

0:08:49.480,0:08:54.780
Your practice has not been like that; that is why it is difficult for you to trust in God's Word.

0:08:54.780,0:08:59.800
I make my schedule around the Word of God.

0:08:59.800,0:09:07.040
I take it first place; I exalt the Word.

0:09:07.040,0:09:09.580
I disagree, I agree.

0:09:09.580,0:09:21.860
I agree with the Word of God and I disagree with any condition, situation or circumstances

0:09:21.860,0:09:24.240
that are contrary to the Word.

0:09:24.240,0:09:27.600
I disagree.

0:09:27.600,0:09:33.680
I agree with the Word of God; I choose to agree.

0:09:33.680,0:09:42.820
But when you are making your schedule, you donâ€™t carry God along.

0:09:42.820,0:09:45.720
You have already prepared your schedule for today.

0:09:45.720,0:09:50.000
When you leave here, you are going to a meeting, you must leave here at such time...

0:09:50.000,0:09:51.800
You don't carry God along.

0:09:51.800,0:09:55.040
We have not been grounded.

0:09:55.040,0:10:01.920
When we are grounded in the Word, we take it first place.

0:10:01.920,0:10:05.540
You exalt the Word.

0:10:05.540,0:10:11.080
How do we wait and believe that He is working out the answer?

0:10:11.080,0:10:17.860
How can we wait without worrying again over the situation?

0:10:17.860,0:10:23.340
When a man of God says, "You are healed, in Jesus' name", you say, "Amen" -

0:10:23.340,0:10:31.900
you would then worry and be anxious, as if you had never prayed at all.

0:10:31.900,0:10:38.140
This is a message you need to receive now.

0:10:38.140,0:10:45.100
If not, you will keep losing your healing by ignorance.

0:10:45.100,0:10:50.320
Why to receive it, if you keep losing it?

0:10:50.320,0:10:58.060
Because that worry alone nullifies your blessing.

0:10:58.060,0:11:00.020
You say, "Man of God, I have a headache".

0:11:00.020,0:11:03.540
I say, "Be healed, in Jesus' name."

0:11:03.540,0:11:11.760
I turn back and immediately you start wondering if you are healed now.

0:11:11.760,0:11:16.900
That statement alone nullifies that healing.

0:11:16.900,0:11:24.680
When you begin to compare places, where you spent millions to receive healing and you did not receive it,

0:11:24.680,0:11:30.560
with a place where somebody would just touch you and say, "You are healed".

0:11:30.560,0:11:36.360
"No, I don't know - this kind of healing - I don't know."

0:11:36.360,0:11:41.680
That nullifies immediately what you received.

0:11:41.680,0:11:47.400
If it is God, it is freedom and it is free.

0:11:47.400,0:11:48.480
Tell your neighbour,

0:11:48.480,0:11:54.200
"If it is God, it is freedom and it is free".

0:11:54.200,0:12:06.120
But if it is man, you have to labour for it and pay with your sweat.

0:12:06.120,0:12:12.920
So, this is what we don't know; the things of God are a mystery.

0:12:12.920,0:12:23.980
That what you receive is free does not call for questioning or doubt, it is God!

0:12:23.980,0:12:31.280
We don't need to struggle to believe.

0:12:31.280,0:12:37.260
Faith comes spontaneously, just naturally.

0:12:37.260,0:12:41.860
But today, we keep on struggling to believe.

0:12:41.860,0:12:45.260
You have to read Psalm 35 three times.

0:12:45.260,0:12:50.800
You wake up at midnight, you have your Bible under the pillow.

0:12:50.800,0:13:04.160
You set your alarm to wake up to say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:13:04.160,0:13:08.400
"He is alive, Amen..."

0:13:08.400,0:13:12.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:12.820,0:13:19.200
We don't need to struggle to believe.

0:13:19.200,0:13:24.780
Believing is natural.

0:13:24.780,0:13:30.820
Many of your children abandoned your house in the past.

0:13:30.820,0:13:34.880
They abandoned their families saying that their father is a drunkard.

0:13:34.880,0:13:39.300
They say they are born-again.

0:13:39.300,0:13:45.940
You could not find them but now suddenly, they are back to the world.

0:13:45.940,0:13:51.060
When you are struggling to believe, you will still come back to the world.

0:13:51.060,0:13:57.400
When you are struggling to accept Jesus, you will soon leave Jesus.

0:13:57.400,0:13:58.260
Tell your neighbour,

0:13:58.260,0:14:05.140
"If you struggle to believe Jesus, you will soon leave Jesus".

0:14:05.140,0:14:15.000
A good example: You lock a brother or sister who is a smoker or a drug-addict inside the house -

0:14:15.000,0:14:18.140
"You are not going to smoke or drink today".

0:14:18.140,0:14:20.680
You lock your son inside the house.

0:14:20.680,0:14:22.800
You say he must fast for three days.

0:14:22.800,0:14:26.320
It is not from his (heart).

0:14:26.320,0:14:28.960
It is not from his heart - to fast.

0:14:28.960,0:14:32.260
You know they are very tough.

0:14:32.260,0:14:33.840
You observe him now.

0:14:33.840,0:14:36.740
You have been telling him that he is a drug-addict.

0:14:36.740,0:14:38.220
You ask him to follow you to the church.

0:14:38.220,0:14:40.180
He says, "No, I am not going to church".

0:14:40.180,0:14:42.720
Any time you go to church, he would go to the club.

0:14:42.720,0:14:46.380
One day you set it up and call your pastor.

0:14:46.380,0:14:50.580
You deceive him and lock the gate.

0:14:50.580,0:14:54.060
Your pastor is there and says, "Three days fasting".

0:14:54.060,0:14:55.860
He says, "Please, I do not want to fast".

0:14:55.860,0:14:57.560
You say, "You must fast".

0:14:57.560,0:15:03.040
You have tried everything to force him to be delivered.

0:15:03.040,0:15:06.920
No, it is not possible.

0:15:06.920,0:15:09.960
Why are you telling him to come to church while he refuses?

0:15:09.960,0:15:16.400
You can pray for him and ask God to touch him.

0:15:16.400,0:15:22.960
Whilst he is in the night club smoking, he will just leave that place one day.

0:15:22.960,0:15:29.220
It could be caused by headache or something that happened, and it will bring him home.

0:15:29.220,0:15:36.820
After some time, he will come to his senses and say, "Mummy, I am sorry - I am tired of this life".

0:15:36.820,0:15:40.720
He will not know that it is because of your prayer.

0:15:40.720,0:15:44.320
Then, you take it up from there.

0:15:44.320,0:15:47.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:47.560,0:15:50.560
Many of us have tried it in the past.

0:15:50.560,0:16:02.400
You struggled to believe, but with time, it became worse in our righteousness.

0:16:02.400,0:16:04.800
We don't trouble to believe.

0:16:04.800,0:16:08.500
Belief is natural and spontaneous.

0:16:08.500,0:16:16.700
Let me tell you: When you work hard to get something and you cannot get that thing, it is very frustrating.

0:16:16.700,0:16:26.220
You work, you labour, and at the end of the day you cannot achieve that - it is very frustrating.

0:16:26.220,0:16:30.820
But when you don't work hard, you leave it naturally...

0:16:30.820,0:16:32.060
Look at what I said:

0:16:32.060,0:16:38.080
Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.

0:16:38.080,0:16:41.020
Things of God are a decision.

0:16:41.020,0:16:48.280
You just sit down and say, "God, I am tired of my former life. I want to take a new life".

0:16:48.280,0:16:49.260
It is simple.

0:16:49.260,0:16:54.500
Make a decision and start your prayer from there.

0:16:54.500,0:16:57.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:57.960,0:17:02.980
Our relationship with God â€“ this is a question of the heart.

0:17:02.980,0:17:07.420
In our heart, whom do we trust?

0:17:07.420,0:17:13.520
When we start praying now, you will begin to move your body.

0:17:13.520,0:17:16.840
How do we know that your heart is also moving like that?

0:17:16.840,0:17:22.200
If I say, "Amen", and all of you say, "Amen"; it is not all of you that say "Amen".

0:17:22.200,0:17:27.320
In truth and faith, before you can say, "Amen", you must believe with all your heart.

0:17:27.320,0:17:31.140
We do not serve our God with our hearts again.

0:17:31.140,0:17:37.540
Our relationship with God â€“ this is a question of the heart.

0:17:37.540,0:17:43.560
In our heart, whom do we trust?

0:17:43.560,0:17:48.880
If you know that, you will begin to get it right - because we are getting it wrong.

0:17:48.880,0:17:55.720
No matter how educated you are, if you apply your education to serve God, you get it wrong.

0:17:55.720,0:17:59.860
The person you trust in your heart is your god.

0:17:59.860,0:18:09.520
Whether it is a tree, palm oil or water - this is your god.

0:18:09.520,0:18:13.700
The person you trust in your heart is your god.

0:18:13.700,0:18:20.680
You say, "He is alive, Amen" - you keep saying that to God, whereas in your heart you don't trust God.

0:18:20.680,0:18:28.880
The person you trust in your heart is your god, not the person you worship.

0:18:28.880,0:18:35.320
Faith is of man's heart; faith is a heart that believes in God.

0:18:35.320,0:18:39.220
So, whom you trust in your heart is your god.

0:18:39.220,0:18:46.880
We donâ€™t trust two things with our heart but with our body, our confession, we can trust a million things.

0:18:46.880,0:18:50.140
With our heart, there is just one thing we trust.

0:18:50.140,0:18:57.540
If you have been trusting God with all your heart, God will be only, not one of those things.

0:18:57.540,0:19:06.560
When you plan to attend different events following your visit in the church - you are "comparing" God.

0:19:06.560,0:19:07.940
God should not be compared with anything.

0:19:07.940,0:19:11.360
If you have trusted God with all your heart, you will not compare Him.

0:19:11.360,0:19:17.160
You can never compare anything with what you trust with your heart.

0:19:17.160,0:19:20.860
With your mouth and confession, you can trust thousands of things

0:19:20.860,0:19:25.080
but with your heart, there is only one thing you can trust.

0:19:25.080,0:19:29.480
What you trust with your heart can move you from this place, as we are talking now.

0:19:29.480,0:19:36.820
If you receive a phone call, "Hello. That million dollars is ready now",

0:19:36.820,0:19:42.500
you would just ask your neighbour, "Where is usher here?"

0:19:42.500,0:19:44.380
They say, "This man is an usher".

0:19:44.380,0:19:49.700
"I am pressed."

0:19:49.700,0:19:52.120
Because we know how to lie.

0:19:52.120,0:19:55.880
If we want something, we can lie within a second.

0:19:55.880,0:20:00.160
Immediately you ask your colleague to help you, "I am pressed".

0:20:00.160,0:20:04.420
You may even say, "I have diabetes".

0:20:04.420,0:20:06.360
It is because you want to leave this place immediately.

0:20:06.360,0:20:09.820
They will now rush to call an usher for you.

0:20:09.820,0:20:11.820
You will not be the one to talk.

0:20:11.820,0:20:12.860
People will want to help you.

0:20:12.860,0:20:15.740
They will say, "Help this man. He is pressed".

0:20:15.740,0:20:25.760
In order to get your way, you will now walk like this until you get to the restroom.

0:20:25.760,0:20:28.740
The usher will show you, "This is the toilet".

0:20:28.740,0:20:29.800
"OK, thank you."

0:20:29.800,0:20:30.860
You will lock yourself there.

0:20:30.860,0:20:41.040
You will now call the man back, "You mean, what is ready? Because I couldn't hear you well.

0:20:41.040,0:20:45.580
T.B. Joshua was talking. There was so much noise".

0:20:45.580,0:20:52.460
Whereas you heard him well but you would like to hear it again, so it will gladden your heart.

0:20:52.460,0:20:59.120
"I said the 2 million dollars are ready. You can come immediately to sign the cheque

0:20:59.120,0:21:02.440
because I will be travelling to the UK this evening".

0:21:02.440,0:21:05.220
"OK - now!

0:21:05.220,0:21:08.220
Give me 2 minutes."

0:21:08.220,0:21:11.340
You will just rush out now.

0:21:11.340,0:21:19.640
You will abandon your car - a bike is very fast.

0:21:19.640,0:21:24.240
You have not been using bike for so long.

0:21:24.240,0:21:28.120
You just take a bike, you abandon your car, your wife and children.

0:21:28.120,0:21:31.980
You take a bike.

0:21:31.980,0:21:38.220
You call your wife, "Wait for me in the church. You may need to sleep there when they close."

0:21:38.220,0:21:41.600
That is the person you trust with all your heart.

0:21:41.600,0:21:42.680
What is that?

0:21:42.680,0:21:46.840
Money.

0:21:46.840,0:21:53.160
You can betray anything for the person you trust with your heart.

0:21:53.160,0:22:01.100
If you trust God with all your heart, your life would be better than this.

0:22:01.100,0:22:05.460
You cannot compare God with anything, once you trust Him with all your heart.

0:22:05.460,0:22:07.900
We are here today.

0:22:07.900,0:22:09.500
You say you trust God.

0:22:09.500,0:22:16.020
Even people who came from other countries - if there had been a phone call before you left,

0:22:16.020,0:22:22.600
that this contract, for which you had been looking for a long time, was ready to be executed,

0:22:22.600,0:22:27.320
you would have postponed your journey.

0:22:27.320,0:22:32.940
For you it is a matter of buying a new ticket and this contract would bring more money.

0:22:32.940,0:22:36.620
You postpone it till...

0:22:36.620,0:22:41.880
What you trust with your heart is only.

0:22:41.880,0:22:47.320
You donâ€™t compare anything with what you trust with your heart.

0:22:47.320,0:22:56.540
You just have to begin to trust God with all your heart today.

0:22:56.540,0:23:03.120
Heart is a place where you cannot trust two things; itâ€™s not possible.

0:23:03.120,0:23:08.500
It is not possible to trust both God and money in your heart.

0:23:08.500,0:23:10.920
That is heart for you.

0:23:10.920,0:23:16.980
You can confess, "Jesus is Lord", and confess other things at the same time,

0:23:16.980,0:23:24.000
but in the heart, only one thing is allowed to work there.

0:23:24.000,0:23:28.820
So, your relationship with God is a question of the heart.

0:23:28.820,0:23:37.400
In your heart, whom do you trust?
