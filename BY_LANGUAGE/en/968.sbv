Thank you.

0:00:03.920,0:00:06.780
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:06.780,0:00:09.320
You may be seated.
Thank you.

0:00:12.040,0:00:21.160
Viewers all over the world, with God, all things are possible.

0:00:21.160,0:00:24.380
What are your challenges?

0:00:24.380,0:00:31.880
With God, all things are possible.

0:00:31.880,0:00:44.500
The life we live is what ushers us into the name, Jesus.

0:00:44.500,0:00:56.500
Tell your neighbour, "The life we live is what ushers us into Jesus' name."

0:00:56.500,0:01:08.920
The life I live is what ushers me into Jesus’ name.

0:01:08.920,0:01:13.040
You can't just wake up and say, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...".

0:01:13.040,0:01:15.760
Where are you coming from?

0:01:15.760,0:01:18.440
That is the question.

0:01:18.440,0:01:22.200
Merry Christmas in advance!

0:01:22.200,0:01:29.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:29.960,0:01:39.400
I remember the wonderful message you received last Sunday on how you can manage your life,

0:01:39.400,0:01:43.160
what you need to do to talk of salvation.

0:01:43.160,0:01:47.060
Here are poor people around you.

0:01:47.060,0:01:57.940
The relationship between salvation and how we manage our possessions.

0:01:57.940,0:02:01.080
We are about to enter a new year.

0:02:01.080,0:02:07.160
The solution you apply now will not be able to solve the challenges tomorrow.

0:02:07.160,0:02:13.460
It can only solve the challenges now.

0:02:13.460,0:02:15.380
Renewal!

0:02:15.380,0:02:33.260
Your way and the manner you live brings about what you are seeing around you.

0:02:33.260,0:02:41.680
When you want to pray, you don't know what to ask for, because there are numerous challenges.

0:02:41.680,0:02:49.740
Because of broken homes, people cannot come together in the morning to pray in the house.

0:02:49.740,0:02:51.940
Like I was saying...

0:02:51.940,0:03:05.320
The life we live is what moves us into calling Jesus’ name.

0:03:05.320,0:03:15.840
That is, the life in the line of God’s Word.

0:03:15.840,0:03:20.480
It is not what I'm doing now that will bring whatever you are going to see.

0:03:20.480,0:03:25.180
This has been done before my coming out.

0:03:25.180,0:03:26.740
Relationship.

0:03:26.740,0:03:33.580
This has been done already - I am only coming here to deliver it.

0:03:33.580,0:03:36.840
Not to work.

0:03:36.840,0:03:44.900
When you wake up in the morning, you need direction

0:03:44.900,0:03:55.640
and the direction only comes from the heart, where God lives.

0:03:55.640,0:03:58.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:58.980,0:04:12.080
This is where God dwells which you can refer to as your spirit

0:04:12.080,0:04:19.680
but when you wake up and there is no direction, you make up direction for yourself.

0:04:19.680,0:04:29.040
These are the causes of challenges today – making up direction, self-direction.

0:04:29.040,0:04:39.980
God is our Director – the direction and the way is what we need now.

0:04:39.980,0:04:45.460
Your challenges – leave them for God; think about God.

0:04:45.460,0:04:50.480
Every blessing attracts challenges.

0:04:50.480,0:05:01.600
Blessing without challenges – you cannot manage the blessings.

0:05:01.600,0:05:09.800
Challenges help us to be strong and preserve us for God.

0:05:09.800,0:05:19.700
For this coming year you are about to enter, you need to be renewed.

0:05:19.700,0:05:25.480
You have everything you need - renewal is the only thing you don't have.

0:05:25.480,0:05:31.660
You say you are poor - I disagree; you are not poor.

0:05:31.660,0:05:33.980
You are not poor.

0:05:33.980,0:05:37.720
(Amen.)

0:05:37.720,0:05:43.940
You say you are poor because you don't know how to exploit the things around you.

0:05:43.940,0:05:50.040
There are so much blessings - you are in the midst of blessings.

0:05:50.040,0:05:54.120
You are in the midst of money - money is everywhere.

0:05:54.120,0:06:00.340
You need to be renewed in your spirit.

0:06:00.340,0:06:04.540
For how long shall we continue this...?

0:06:04.540,0:06:09.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:09.320,0:06:13.420
We are financially "buoyant" more than spiritual.

0:06:13.420,0:06:19.000
We are becoming more prosperous than spiritual.

0:06:19.000,0:06:23.060
That is a cause of your complaining.

0:06:23.060,0:06:39.140
Even if you have money, that complain will not go, that will not remove your nightmare, isolation or depression.

0:06:39.140,0:06:45.740
There are many sicknesses and afflictions for which there is no medicine.

0:06:45.740,0:06:49.580
You have money, you go to the doctor for the better treatment,

0:06:49.580,0:06:55.960
but there are many afflictions without medicine.

0:06:55.960,0:07:04.280
If you say money is the answer - what about afflictions without medicine?

0:07:04.280,0:07:13.480
These are curses - only God can remove them.

0:07:13.480,0:07:17.860
This new year, your spirit must be renewed.

0:07:17.860,0:07:21.580
When your spirit is renewed, you will discover yourself.

0:07:21.580,0:07:30.980
It is not your sweat or your labour that brings out that blessing you are talking about.

0:07:30.980,0:07:38.400
It is our relationship with God that causes this to happen.

0:07:38.400,0:07:45.440
When you are renewed spiritually, it will affect your family and children as well.

0:07:45.440,0:07:55.220
Ability to be able to put your challenges behind and meditate on Jesus - this is what you don't have.

0:07:55.220,0:08:04.720
Tell your neighbour, "Ability to be able to put your challenges behind and meditate on Jesus -

0:08:04.720,0:08:10.120
this is what we all lack."

0:08:10.120,0:08:16.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:16.160,0:08:23.080
Look at the Word: "In this world there will be challenges" - He said it.

0:08:23.080,0:08:28.160
He said, "Put it behind because I have overcome for you."

0:08:28.160,0:08:31.860
But the ability to put it behind...

0:08:31.860,0:08:42.140
When you have a headache - ignore that headache and focus on Jesus - that is the ability we need now.

0:08:42.140,0:08:49.000
You cannot be meditating on your challenges and on Jesus at the same time.

0:08:49.000,0:08:53.160
The ability to be able to put behind our situation.

0:08:53.160,0:09:05.980
The situation is there: You have a serious headache but you are more of Jesus - with all your heart you are yearning for Jesus.

0:09:05.980,0:09:15.220
Just put that behind you: The ability to be able to do that is what we lack.

0:09:15.220,0:09:21.080
It seems that our challenges overcome us.

0:09:21.080,0:09:27.620
We want to worship God without challenges.

0:09:27.620,0:09:37.340
Ability to put our challenges aside and worship Him - our spirits must be renewed.

0:09:37.340,0:09:47.800
To renew our spirits, right now, begin to meditate on the Word -

0:09:47.800,0:09:54.880
turn it over and over and over in our hearts.

0:09:54.880,0:09:59.920
Meditate on it and turn it over and over.

0:09:59.920,0:10:03.820
Turn it over - don't let it go.

0:10:03.820,0:10:08.260
Continue to meditate on it.

0:10:08.260,0:10:10.660
Before you know it...

0:10:10.660,0:10:13.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:13.900,0:10:18.560
You are saturated already - before you know it.

0:10:18.560,0:10:26.040
You must prosper in your spiritual life first.

0:10:26.040,0:10:38.640
Get your spiritual life in order; that is where the power, ability of God lies.

0:10:38.640,0:10:48.440
There is nothing you have not enjoyed but the relationship with God, you've not enjoyed properly.

0:10:48.440,0:11:00.660
Everything: you enjoyed money, pleasure - but relationship with God in a proper way - you have not.

0:11:00.660,0:11:07.120
Why can't you put it before you and let it be your first priority?

0:11:07.120,0:11:13.480
There is nothing that can change you and bring what you are looking for.

0:11:13.480,0:11:18.340
That proper relationship.

0:11:18.340,0:11:26.460
It is time that you should know Him like children know their fathers.

0:11:26.460,0:11:29.280
Stop imagining Him: "Jesus said this...".

0:11:29.280,0:11:32.820
Somebody will tell you, "Jesus says this...".

0:11:32.820,0:11:38.240
You should be able to hear by yourself - it is time to hear this.

0:11:38.240,0:11:42.660
The life you live here is the life you are going to meet over there.

0:11:42.660,0:11:45.840
Don't let anybody tell you, "Heaven, Heaven...".

0:11:45.840,0:11:47.480
How do you live this life?

0:11:47.480,0:11:49.800
Heaven is reward.

0:11:49.800,0:11:53.920
What are you doing and expect a reward?

0:11:53.920,0:11:58.000
The file will be opened to you.

0:11:58.000,0:12:02.400
You are planting here - you will reap over there.

0:12:02.400,0:12:05.240
What are you planting?

0:12:05.240,0:12:11.420
Right now, our spiritual life is the first priority.

0:12:11.420,0:12:19.620
The money you are looking for, you can never have enough.

0:12:19.620,0:12:30.380
Tell your neighbour, “The wealth, possessions you are looking for, you can never have enough”.

0:12:30.380,0:12:38.820
Because we can never have enough, there is an urge to steal, to kill, and to destroy.

0:12:38.820,0:12:47.720
The urge - because we never can have enough money, possessions, and other things you are looking for.

0:12:47.720,0:12:53.200
It is not possible because there are always people above you.

0:12:53.200,0:12:58.380
In the spirit, in your relationship with God, there is a place for you.

0:12:58.380,0:13:01.540
There is a place for me, there is a place for you.

0:13:01.540,0:13:11.760
God purposely created a space for me, "OK, T.B. Joshua - this is yours. This is what to do".

0:13:11.760,0:13:12.780
This was only for me.

0:13:12.780,0:13:16.200
You too, you have your own space.

0:13:16.200,0:13:23.040
There is not much competition, that would make you to be having a...

0:13:23.040,0:13:27.720
... unless you are a "zero" - like at the level many of us are today.

0:13:27.720,0:13:31.560
You cannot sense or be filled.

0:13:31.560,0:13:38.680
The life we live is what moves us into what?

0:13:38.680,0:13:40.880
Jesus' name.

0:13:40.880,0:13:44.620
What kind of life are you living?

0:13:44.620,0:13:50.500
Jesus' name is not just something you can just come and claim, "Jesus, in Jesus..." - no.

0:13:50.500,0:13:57.660
The life you live is what moves you into Jesus’ name.

0:13:57.660,0:14:02.640
That is, in line with God’s Word.

0:14:02.640,0:14:09.220
It ushers us into calling Jesus.

0:14:09.220,0:14:14.560
You believe so much in majority, not God’s authority.

0:14:14.560,0:14:21.760
Create time for yourself to meet God.

0:14:21.760,0:14:29.880
You must cultivate this habit to meet God.

0:14:29.880,0:14:38.240
Talk to Him, even though at the beginning it is like, "whom am I talking to? I don't hear from Him.

0:14:38.240,0:14:40.020
It is only me who is talking".

0:14:40.020,0:14:43.400
I stop when I want to stop, and not when He wants me to stop.

0:14:43.400,0:14:46.200
I can't hear, I don't know whether He hears me.

0:14:46.200,0:14:50.060
Everything big starts little.

0:14:50.060,0:15:00.120
Yes, it will start like that to show your genuine willingness.

0:15:00.120,0:15:04.740
Everything starts outside reality.

0:15:04.740,0:15:13.140
But when it starts with truth and faith, you begin to enter reality.

0:15:13.140,0:15:15.520
Look at what happened to Peter and Jesus.

0:15:15.520,0:15:20.380
Jesus was on the sea; Peter said, "I want to come to You".

0:15:20.380,0:15:27.040
Jesus said, "You want to come to Me? OK, come".

0:15:27.040,0:15:33.780
Outside reality, he started walking on his own power on the sea.

0:15:33.780,0:15:50.200
Jesus was looking at him, "I want to see your genuine willingness. If you are genuine, I will come into the matter".

0:15:50.200,0:15:52.160
How do we test genuineness?

0:15:52.160,0:15:56.440
We test genuineness through challenges.

0:15:56.440,0:16:01.260
If your faith is not tested, it’s not real faith.

0:16:01.260,0:16:04.480
Our faith must be tested.

0:16:04.480,0:16:09.560
That is why we call it, ‘faith’.

0:16:09.560,0:16:22.360
Don’t be like Jesus in your body but in your heart; in our heart, we are like Jesus.

0:16:22.360,0:16:29.580
With your track record - it is enough not to be deceived.

0:16:29.580,0:16:40.800
You should be able to know what is right and what is wrong, when it comes to the issue of God.

0:16:40.800,0:16:44.820
Rise up.

0:16:44.820,0:16:50.620
Ask the Holy Spirit of Truth to reveal Jesus to you.

0:16:50.620,0:16:55.740
The Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus to me!

0:16:55.740,0:17:01.620
This is Spirit prayer.

0:17:01.620,0:17:05.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:05.740,0:17:12.760
The Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus to me!

0:17:12.760,0:17:22.580
Ask Him to help cleanse all your wrongs.

0:17:22.580,0:17:36.900
Help cleanse all my wrongs in action, thoughts and deeds – knowingly and unknowingly.

0:17:36.900,0:17:46.540
Open your lips, help cleanse all my wrongs.

0:17:46.540,0:17:50.880
... you cannot mention.

0:17:50.880,0:18:04.780
Viewers, ask the Holy Spirit to reveal Jesus to you.

0:18:04.780,0:18:08.660
Make my heart a contact point.

0:18:08.660,0:18:14.520
Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus to me.

0:18:14.520,0:18:20.440
Do the introduction, Holy Spirit!

0:18:20.440,0:18:25.100
Do the engagement, Holy Spirit!

0:18:25.100,0:18:27.980
Align me, Holy Spirit!

0:18:27.980,0:18:31.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:31.980,0:18:47.400
Cleanse all my wrongs in action, thoughts and deeds – knowingly and unknowingly.

0:18:47.400,0:18:51.820
Make it happen, in Jesus’ name!

0:18:51.820,0:18:56.360
(Amen.)

0:18:56.360,0:19:05.340
Open your lips, pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.

0:19:05.340,0:19:07.280
Prayer!

0:19:07.280,0:19:12.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:12.760,0:19:14.600
Pray the character...

0:19:14.600,0:19:22.820
Viewers, pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.

0:19:22.820,0:19:34.040
Be the Spirit of adoption to me, Lord!

0:19:34.040,0:19:36.020
Prayer!

0:19:36.020,0:19:49.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:49.140,0:19:52.260
In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.

0:19:52.260,0:19:54.300
(Amen.)

0:19:54.300,0:19:59.160
Make it happen, in the name of Jesus!

0:19:59.160,0:20:03.480
(Amen.)

0:20:03.480,0:20:06.680
You have so many talents.

0:20:06.680,0:20:10.740
Many of us here know that they have talents.

0:20:10.740,0:20:12.760
You have gifts.

0:20:12.760,0:20:17.960
Being very intelligent but nothing...

0:20:17.960,0:20:23.060
Your time seems to be a waste, anywhere you go.

0:20:23.060,0:20:26.460
Some talents are dormant.

0:20:26.460,0:20:30.160
Nobody calls for your talent, nobody asks of you.

0:20:30.160,0:20:35.240
Many are working under those who are dormant and can't offer anything.

0:20:35.240,0:20:40.040
It is your talent they are using, but you are working under them.

0:20:40.040,0:20:49.560
Open your lips, ask God to help you serve Him with all your talents.

0:20:49.560,0:21:02.120
If Jesus helps you, royals, princes, kings, queens will discover your talent.

0:21:02.120,0:21:02.840
(Amen.)

0:21:02.840,0:21:09.060
Open your lips and ask God, “Help me to serve You with all my talents”.

0:21:09.060,0:21:11.120
Prayer!

0:21:11.120,0:21:18.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:18.980,0:21:31.040
Help me to serve You with all my talents, time, money and labour of love – help me, Lord!

0:21:31.040,0:21:46.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.

0:21:50.440,0:21:51.620
(Amen.)

0:21:51.620,0:21:52.960
I cannot hear you.

0:21:52.960,0:21:55.620
(Amen.)

0:21:55.620,0:21:57.440
Lord, make it happen!

0:21:57.440,0:21:58.360
(Amen.)

0:21:58.360,0:21:59.380
Make it happen!

0:21:59.380,0:22:00.440
(Amen.)

0:22:00.440,0:22:01.380
Make it happen!

0:22:01.380,0:22:04.460
(Amen.)

0:22:04.460,0:22:11.880
There are many talented ones but their talent seems to be dormant.

0:22:11.880,0:22:21.860
No one, no king, no queen, no people call for it.

0:22:21.860,0:22:30.520
Lord, make it happen!
(Amen.)

0:22:30.520,0:22:36.200
You are gifted; the gifts are dormant.

0:22:36.200,0:22:37.480
You need revelation.

0:22:37.480,0:22:40.180
(Amen.)

0:22:40.180,0:22:41.280
You need what?

0:22:41.280,0:22:43.340
(Revelation.)

0:22:43.340,0:22:45.100
Meditation brings revelation.

0:22:45.100,0:22:46.200
Say it.

0:22:46.200,0:22:47.880
(Meditation brings revelation.)

0:22:47.880,0:22:48.920
I can't hear you.

0:22:48.920,0:22:50.980
(Meditation brings revelation.)

0:22:50.980,0:22:58.060
Begin to meditate on the Word.

0:22:58.060,0:23:02.240
Begin to meditate on the Word – without stopping; without ceasing.

0:23:02.240,0:23:08.880
Begin to meditate on the Word – turn it over and over and over in your heart.

0:23:08.880,0:23:12.400
Meditation brings revelation.

0:23:12.400,0:23:20.260
Lord, make it happen!
(Amen.)

0:23:20.260,0:23:32.280
You know – when your talent and gift is honoured, joy comes.

0:23:32.280,0:23:43.200
Every God's general in the Bible - their talent was revealed to the king and queen.

0:23:43.200,0:23:47.120
Lord, make it happen, in the name of Jesus!

0:23:47.120,0:23:50.760
(Amen.)

0:23:50.760,0:23:54.940
Make it happen, in the name of Jesus!
(Amen.)

0:23:54.940,0:23:58.820
Open your lips right now and begin to confess your freedom.

0:23:58.820,0:24:00.400
Make it happen, Lord!

0:24:00.400,0:24:04.580
Make it happen!

0:24:04.580,0:24:08.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:08.760,0:24:19.600
Make it happen!

0:24:19.600,0:24:26.080
Reveal my talent and gift.

0:24:26.080,0:24:30.880
Usher me to the kings and people that need me.

0:24:30.880,0:24:33.140
Make it happen!

0:24:33.140,0:24:47.220
Begin to break the chain – any chain that is holding you, your talent and gift; break it!

0:24:51.360,0:24:53.980
In the name of Jesus Christ.

0:24:53.980,0:24:56.500
(Amen.)

0:24:56.500,0:24:58.420
Yes.

0:24:58.420,0:25:05.180
This is an area the Lord said I should begin to touch before the new year.

0:25:05.180,0:25:07.040
You need to discover yourself.

0:25:07.040,0:25:09.500
(Amen.)

0:25:09.500,0:25:20.280
There are many kings, queens, people that need you but there is a chain, barrier between you and them.

0:25:20.280,0:25:32.300
Tell your neighbour: "There are many kings, queens, people that need you but there is a barrier".

0:25:32.300,0:25:35.400
I can't hear you.

0:25:35.400,0:25:40.520
But you keep praying for money and prosperity.

0:25:40.520,0:25:44.380
What kind of prosperity is that when there is a barrier?

0:25:44.380,0:25:48.920
What you need is more than prosperity and money.

0:25:48.920,0:25:59.160
There is a barrier between you and people who need you, your services, gift and talent.

0:25:59.160,0:26:00.880
There is a barrier.

0:26:00.880,0:26:08.440
The barrier is simply the wall between you and God -

0:26:08.440,0:26:14.600
a relationship must be established between you.

0:26:14.600,0:26:26.900
There is no one without gift and talent – you are created with your talent and gift.

0:26:26.900,0:26:37.860
These gifts and talents will usher you to the kings, nations and queens.

0:26:37.860,0:26:43.420
Today, the opposite is the case.

0:26:43.420,0:26:51.320
Talented people have now turned to beggars.

0:26:51.320,0:27:01.060
Whatever barrier between you, begin to break that barrier right now!

0:27:01.060,0:27:04.500
Open your lips and break the barrier!

0:27:04.500,0:27:08.980
Break the barrier!
