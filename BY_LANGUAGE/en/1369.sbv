WHO NEEDS FORGIVENESS?

0:00:01.220,0:00:04.040
Ask your neighbour.

0:00:04.040,0:00:07.660
WHO NEEDS FORGIVENESS?

0:00:07.660,0:00:09.760
Hallelujah!

0:00:09.760,0:00:19.720
This will take you to the Book of Romans 3 and we will read the proof text verse 23 and also verse 10.

0:00:19.720,0:00:32.320
"As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one'."

0:00:32.320,0:00:35.480
So I'm taking you to verse 23.

0:00:35.480,0:00:42.680
"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

0:00:42.680,0:00:44.280
Hallelujah!

0:00:44.280,0:00:47.440
The question remains: Who needs forgiveness?

0:00:47.440,0:00:58.180
From the Book of Romans 3:23, one thing  is clear - all have sinned.

0:00:58.180,0:01:04.500
In verse 10, "There is no one righteous, not even one".

0:01:04.500,0:01:07.400
What does this mean?

0:01:07.400,0:01:43.320
Whether victims or perpetrators, we all stand in helpless need of His divine forgiveness.

0:01:43.340,0:01:49.520
Whether you are the one who caused the trouble or pain

0:01:49.520,0:01:59.260
or you are the one who suffered the effects, we all need forgiveness.

0:01:59.260,0:02:08.060
Whether you are the one who caused the pain, the trouble

0:02:08.060,0:02:20.300
or you are the one who suffers the effects, we all need forgiveness

0:02:20.300,0:02:22.920
Take note of that.

0:02:22.920,0:02:28.080
Let me also take you to the Book of  Luke23:34.

0:02:28.080,0:02:36.520
"Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them...' "

0:02:36.520,0:02:43.820
Take note of the word 'them'

0:02:43.820,0:03:00.120
because it includes both the offender and the offended.

0:03:00.120,0:03:04.980
"Father, forgive them." Take note of the word 'them.'

0:03:04.980,0:03:09.320
This should be the standard of a Christian.

0:03:09.320,0:03:13.180
Tell your neighbour, "This should be your standard".

0:03:13.180,0:03:18.340
This should be the standard of a true Christian.

0:03:18.340,0:03:23.560
And this should be your standard, if you are a true Christian.

0:03:23.560,0:03:26.640
This should be your standard.

0:03:26.640,0:03:30.440
He said, "Father forgive them."

0:03:30.440,0:03:33.040
Take note of the word 'them'

0:03:33.040,0:03:38.860
because it includes both the offender and the offended.

0:03:38.860,0:03:45.680
Sin's power over me is broken

0:03:45.680,0:03:47.680
Come on!

0:03:47.680,0:03:56.780
Sin's power over us is broken

0:03:56.780,0:04:07.900
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:04:07.900,0:04:15.960
Sin's power over us is broken

0:04:15.960,0:04:19.880
Listen to that!

0:04:19.880,0:04:26.360
This should be the standard of a true Christian

0:04:26.360,0:04:36.240
because it includes both the offender and the offended.

0:04:36.240,0:04:47.820
Sin is never covered by our appearance.

0:04:47.820,0:04:51.740
Sin is never covered by our presence.

0:04:51.740,0:05:01.280
Nowadays when we come out as ministers of God, we put on a very big chain, this.

0:05:01.280,0:05:04.360
This cannot cover our sin.

0:05:04.360,0:05:09.500
Sin is never covered by our big Bible.

0:05:09.500,0:05:12.520
Some will carry their Bible with two hands.

0:05:12.520,0:05:15.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:15.020,0:05:22.480
Sin is never covered by our prayer.

0:05:22.480,0:05:31.060
"In Jesus' name..." - no matter how much you pray or tears,

0:05:31.060,0:05:38.500
sin can only be removed by repentance.

0:05:38.500,0:05:47.040
Sin's power over me is broken

0:05:47.040,0:05:56.020
Sin's power over us is broken

0:05:56.020,0:06:07.580
When Jesus went I went
When He went we went

0:06:07.580,0:06:16.940
Sin's power over us is broken

0:06:16.940,0:06:22.220
What is repentance?

0:06:22.220,0:06:32.320
Repentance means being sorry for sin or wrong; it's not by tears.

0:06:32.320,0:06:43.460
It's being sorry for wrong, for sin, being committed to a new way of life, that of serving God.

0:06:43.460,0:06:53.680
Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.

0:06:53.680,0:06:58.000
When things go wrong, you look around and say,

0:06:58.000,0:07:04.660
"Oh, my business is down as a result of witches and wizards.

0:07:04.660,0:07:09.600
Ah, that grandmum, grandfather, done this, done that".

0:07:09.600,0:07:18.980
We begin to look, pointing our finger at others; looking for a scapegoat.

0:07:18.980,0:07:23.160
But when business is booming, it's our handwork.

0:07:23.160,0:07:31.600
"I don't sleep, I work throughout the night; as a result, I become a millionaire."

0:07:31.600,0:07:36.140
But a poor man will not say, "As a result of my effort, I became poor",

0:07:36.140,0:07:39.640
but a rich man - as a result of what?

0:07:39.640,0:07:41.240
I trust you.

0:07:41.240,0:07:43.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:43.360,0:07:58.920
When things are not going well, we point accusing fingers at others.

0:07:58.920,0:08:07.960
Tell your neighbour, "Stop repeating stories of those who fail you.

0:08:07.960,0:08:14.520
Stop repeating stories of those who hurt you".

0:08:14.520,0:08:26.320
Stop repeating stories of those who fail you, who hurt you, who lie against you.

0:08:26.320,0:08:33.480
Stop repeating. That will not help you.

0:08:33.480,0:08:37.960
Your repentance does not agree with this.

0:08:37.960,0:08:43.120
Stop pointing your fingers at others.

0:08:43.120,0:08:48.000
"Yes, my boss sacked me, that is why I'm poor.

0:08:48.000,0:08:50.980
I don't know what I have done to my boss."

0:08:50.980,0:08:56.580
Stop thinking on your flaws, your trouble.

0:08:56.580,0:09:07.860
When we are offended, we feel hurt and blame our offender.

0:09:07.860,0:09:16.000
We always defend our envy, jealousy, anger, grudges.

0:09:16.000,0:09:24.000
We always defend to justify our reason not to forgive.

0:09:24.000,0:09:28.400
"No, I will not forgive because he is a small boy, he is my servant."

0:09:28.400,0:09:32.620
"No no, it's not possible for me."

0:09:32.620,0:09:37.640
We justify our reason not to forgive.

WHO NEEDS FORGIVENESS?

0:09:42.280,0:09:46.660
"No no, I'm older than him."

0:09:46.660,0:09:50.360
"I helped him. I sent him to university."

0:09:50.360,0:09:54.440
"Yes, I'm a boss. Why should this happen to me?"

0:09:54.440,0:10:05.560
We always defend our reason not to forgive.

0:10:05.560,0:10:12.760

If you cannot forgive yourself, you cannot forgive others.

0:10:20.340,0:10:24.980
Since you have not forgiven yourself, you cannot forgive others.

0:10:24.980,0:10:38.880
You need to forgive yourself first, to forgive others. You have not yet forgiven yourself.

0:10:38.880,0:10:42.580
So where are we going? Vanity upon vanity.

0:10:42.580,0:10:47.100
Stop repeating stories of those who failed you.

0:10:47.100,0:10:52.680
Your junior ones, your this, your husband, your wife, your this, your that - stop repeating.

0:10:52.680,0:10:57.680
If you don't stop repeating, you will continue to have carryovers in your life.

0:10:57.680,0:11:00.120
And that is what is happening to you now.

0:11:00.120,0:11:04.160
Tell your neighbour, "You have carryovers".

0:11:04.160,0:11:09.480
'Carryover' means the trouble you had yesterday, you are still experiencing it.

0:11:09.480,0:11:15.660
The trouble last week, you are still in it. That is 'carryover'.

0:11:15.660,0:11:20.480
When you have carryovers, you cannot enjoy today's grace.

0:11:20.480,0:11:24.720
You know in your university days - 'carryover', you know what it means.

0:11:24.720,0:11:29.300
You study with your mate, you go back to your junior too, you study with them.

0:11:29.300,0:11:34.560
You go back again to your first year; you go back to the junior class to study.

0:11:34.560,0:11:39.720
When you are studying now, they don't know whether you are a senior or a junior.

0:11:39.720,0:11:42.480
What a humiliation.

0:11:42.480,0:11:52.080
You are living a carryover life because you keep repeating the stories of those who failed you,

0:11:52.080,0:11:54.920
stories of those who hurt you.

0:11:54.920,0:12:02.060
That is the life you are living now - carryover.

0:12:02.060,0:12:08.860
You carry the trouble yesterday and carry the trouble today and you are not destined like that.

0:12:08.860,0:12:13.180
You are only destined to face the trouble today.

0:12:13.180,0:12:15.280
The grace today is for today.

0:12:15.280,0:12:18.320
You carry yesterday's trouble and carry today's trouble.

0:12:18.320,0:12:21.660
Today's grace is for today.

0:12:21.660,0:12:25.000
This is the case with you.

0:12:25.000,0:12:28.060
You heard what Jesus said; I repeat again.

0:12:28.060,0:12:31.780
He said, "Father forgive them".

0:12:31.780,0:12:34.300
Take note  of the word 'them'.

0:12:34.300,0:12:50.460
The word 'them' means the offender and the offended,

0:12:50.460,0:13:04.840
the one that caused the trouble and also the one that suffered the effects.

0:13:04.840,0:13:07.260
I want to pray with you. Thank you.

0:13:07.260,0:13:12.080
This is for you so that you will be able to maintain your blessing.

0:13:12.080,0:13:14.560
You just have to live and let others live.

Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.

0:14:34.940,0:14:36.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:36.140,0:14:40.020
[Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.]

0:14:40.020,0:14:41.240
I can't hear you.

0:14:41.240,0:14:44.900
[Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.]

0:14:44.900,0:14:49.860
Because when we say, "Let's pray...",

0:14:49.860,0:14:53.700
it is faith that counts.

0:14:53.700,0:14:59.060
All this "Jesus!" without faith, you are talking to yourself.

0:14:59.060,0:15:08.820
Tell your neighbour, "Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith".

0:15:08.820,0:15:10.060
I can't hear you.

0:15:10.060,0:15:14.100
[Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.]

0:15:14.100,0:15:15.820
Yes!

0:15:15.820,0:15:20.320
It is faith that counts!

0:15:20.320,0:15:23.300
All this praying, "In the name of Jesus!" -

0:15:23.300,0:15:28.820
that is why you cannot give account of your prayer.

0:15:28.820,0:15:41.080
Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith, because it is faith that counts.

you can receive but it will not be permanent.

0:17:59.480,0:18:12.340
You can receive a miracle but to keep that miracle, you must be a member of Christ's home.

0:18:12.340,0:18:27.200
