PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA - The Synagogue Church Of All Nations

0:00:03.280,0:00:06.900
I believe God will use me to add to your joy.

0:00:06.900,0:00:10.560
Amen!

0:00:10.560,0:00:14.440
Already, there is joy in the house.

0:00:14.440,0:00:19.140
There is joy - you will agree with me that there is joy in the house.

0:00:19.140,0:00:20.220
Yes.

0:00:20.220,0:00:22.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:22.620,0:00:33.820
Let's quickly take a look at the book of John 15:7.

0:00:33.820,0:00:42.540
"If you remain in Me and My Words remain in you,

0:00:42.540,0:00:52.720
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."

0:00:52.720,0:00:58.960
This shows that Christ and His Word are one.

0:00:58.960,0:01:02.720
Simple. Take a look again.

0:01:02.720,0:01:11.140
"If you remain in Me and My Words remain in you,

0:01:11.140,0:01:25.040
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."

0:01:25.040,0:01:32.140
This means, Christ and His Word are one.

0:01:32.140,0:01:38.340
Jesus - Word , Word - Jesus.

0:01:38.340,0:01:43.700
Christ and His Word are one.

0:01:43.700,0:01:46.680
Hallelujah!

0:01:46.680,0:01:55.220
If the Word dwells in you, it produces prayer fruit.

0:01:55.220,0:01:58.540
F-R-U-I-T

0:01:58.540,0:02:01.380
How can this Word dwell in us?

0:02:01.380,0:02:09.220
It is not only committing the Word to memory,

0:02:09.220,0:02:12.140
because of where we are coming from

0:02:12.140,0:02:14.400
and how you are brought up.

0:02:14.400,0:02:19.860
You are educated and in education, academy, you need to memorise.

0:02:19.860,0:02:24.680
But coming to the house of God - the Bible -

0:02:24.680,0:02:31.720
it is not only committing the Word to memory which is indeed valuable

0:02:31.720,0:02:33.560
- it is good to memorise -

0:02:33.560,0:02:42.600
but allowing the Word to become an integral part of you.

0:02:42.600,0:02:47.400
You know we have a sitting room, and we have a bedroom.

0:02:47.400,0:02:50.640
So when you choose to memorise the Word,

0:02:50.640,0:02:55.000
it will only be acting in the sitting room but not in the bedroom.

0:02:55.000,0:02:59.900
But you need it in the bedroom because it lives in you.

0:02:59.900,0:03:09.840
It must dominate you, rule you and sanctify your spirit nature.

0:03:09.840,0:03:14.360
The reason why the Word must be an integral part of you is

0:03:14.360,0:03:21.680
because Jesus can only dwell in your heart through faith.

0:03:21.680,0:03:26.160
And Bible faith comes from God's Word.

0:03:26.160,0:03:30.460
I mean Bible faith; not faith - there are many faiths, all kinds of faith.

0:03:30.460,0:03:39.140
Bible faith comes from God's Word.

0:03:39.140,0:03:45.200
Like it is defined in the book of Romans 10:17.

0:03:45.200,0:03:47.600
Let me put it the way it is written there.

0:03:47.600,0:03:57.080
"Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the Word of God."

0:03:57.080,0:04:07.400
When the Word dwells in you, dominates you, rules you,

0:04:07.400,0:04:16.580
lives in you, it will produce prayer fruit.

0:04:16.580,0:04:20.720
When you say, "In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name, Amen, Give me biscuit...",

0:04:20.720,0:04:23.560
you just receive them.

0:04:23.560,0:04:26.900
"Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, here I am!

0:04:26.900,0:04:29.240
Forgive me, forgive me!"

0:04:29.240,0:04:39.260
You receive those things - these are the prayer fruits - if the Word dominates you.

0:04:39.260,0:04:46.180
The Word dominating you becomes the Lordship of Christ in you.

0:04:46.180,0:04:49.100
The Lordship; Christ Himself.

0:04:49.100,0:05:01.900
Letting the Word have right of way in your life is letting Christ Himself have right of way.

0:05:01.900,0:05:03.260
Say to your neighbour:

0:05:03.260,0:05:16.680
Letting the Word have right of way in your life is letting Christ have right of way.

0:05:16.680,0:05:29.040
Letting the Word have right of way in your life is letting Christ Himself have right of way.

0:05:29.040,0:05:33.080
If the Word has no right of way in your life, forget it.

0:05:33.080,0:05:39.040
So this is Christ - you go straight; it's like a magnet.

0:05:39.040,0:05:41.580
Nail - magnet.

0:05:41.580,0:05:44.600
If the magnet is there and the nail is here,

0:05:44.600,0:05:49.500
there's no way they can jump and attract - connect.

0:05:49.500,0:05:53.880
The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ Himself.

0:05:53.880,0:05:59.560
Message Title: BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD

0:05:59.560,0:06:11.620
The Lord will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.

0:06:11.620,0:06:29.900
The Lord will only meet you when you obey what He told you to do, by His Spirit, based on His Word.

0:06:29.900,0:06:33.860
That is, act in obedience to God.

0:06:33.860,0:06:38.200
Like someone shared a testimony just now and said, "Praise the Lord!

0:06:38.200,0:06:44.720
The Morning Water, I sprayed it three times this way, four times this way.

0:06:44.720,0:06:46.520
At 12 midnight I sprayed it."

0:06:46.520,0:06:51.180
You quickly write down all those statements.

0:06:51.180,0:06:54.300
By the time you get your Morning Water, you get home and spray it.

0:06:54.300,0:06:57.380
"How many times did the lady say she sprayed it?

0:06:57.380,0:07:00.120
Oh! Four times!

0:07:00.120,0:07:02.520
This time - twelve midnight - four times!"

0:07:02.520,0:07:07.100
You now set your clock to 12 midnight.

0:07:07.100,0:07:13.080
When it rings, "Oh! I want to spray my Morning Water".

0:07:13.080,0:07:21.740
It will not work because this is imitation.

0:07:21.740,0:07:26.680
Lord I want to be like Jesus

0:07:26.680,0:07:42.440
Inner my heart

0:07:42.440,0:07:51.600
Lord I want to be like Jesus

0:07:51.600,0:07:58.200
Inner my heart

0:07:58.200,0:07:59.980
That is it.

0:07:59.980,0:08:07.080
Everything that becomes of us today is purely imitation.

0:08:07.080,0:08:16.900
You went to school because someone studied marketing and later became a general manager.

0:08:16.900,0:08:20.640
You say to your parents, "I want to study marketing".

0:08:20.640,0:08:22.880
"I want to study marketing."  - "Why?"

0:08:22.880,0:08:27.340
"Because that man is a millionaire and he studied marketing."

0:08:27.340,0:08:29.980
That is the only reason why you want to study marketing.

0:08:29.980,0:08:33.260
You have abandoned God's vision in your life.

0:08:33.260,0:08:38.760
You see a soldier or a military man with uniform - a general.

0:08:38.760,0:08:40.920
Beautiful!

0:08:40.920,0:08:44.560
You say, "Oh! I want to be a soldier!"

0:08:44.560,0:08:50.240
Just because of that very attractive uniform, you abandon God's calling in your life.

0:08:50.240,0:08:53.560
That's imitation of man.

0:08:53.560,0:08:57.980
Some people that are looking on might have seen some beautiful attire.

0:08:57.980,0:08:59.480
By the time they leave from here,

0:08:59.480,0:09:02.520
they will now begin to look for that attire in the market;

0:09:02.520,0:09:05.300
you want to buy the same uniform.

0:09:05.300,0:09:10.600
And I know many of you might have gone to the car park to see some beautiful cars.

0:09:10.600,0:09:14.640
You see a posh car - "Let me take a picture."

0:09:14.640,0:09:20.480
"When I leave church today, I have to look for this type of car. I need it."

0:09:20.480,0:09:25.360
Our life is full of imitation.

0:09:25.360,0:09:30.680
You look at different styles of hair, the way people plait their hair.

0:09:30.680,0:09:33.880
Message Title: BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD

0:09:33.880,0:09:36.800
Life is full of imitation.

0:09:36.800,0:09:43.440
This is why we are very limited in our thinking, doings and way.

0:09:43.440,0:09:48.780
You can't go beyond when you are a type that copies.

0:09:48.780,0:09:51.900
You base your life on copying.

0:09:51.900,0:09:55.780
There is so much weakness in copying.

0:09:55.780,0:09:59.200
You can imagine how many business cards you have in your pocket.

0:09:59.200,0:10:01.320
You are the architect, you are the lawyer,

0:10:01.320,0:10:02.840
you are the accountant, and you are this

0:10:02.840,0:10:05.480
because you don't know what to do again - your copy.

0:10:05.480,0:10:08.760
Each time you see someone who is prosperous in his career,

0:10:08.760,0:10:13.940
you abandon your career - you jump into that career.

0:10:13.940,0:10:17.140
Prosperity is not evidence that you are called.

0:10:17.140,0:10:20.640
You can be rich in doing what you are doing

0:10:20.640,0:10:24.100
and yet you are not called for that job from Heaven.

0:10:24.100,0:10:27.680
You can be very rich in what you are doing

0:10:27.680,0:10:32.140
and yet, it's not your calling  from Heaven.

0:10:32.140,0:10:35.260
The end will prove that it is your calling.

0:10:35.260,0:10:36.160
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:36.160,0:10:43.280
The end will prove that what I'm doing is my calling from God.

0:10:43.280,0:10:45.200
Tell your neighbour. Don't be afraid.

0:10:45.200,0:10:54.040
The end will prove that what you are doing is your calling from God.

0:10:54.040,0:10:58.880
If there is nothing like that - people like me, where would I be today?

0:10:58.880,0:11:02.820
This is inheritance from Apostles.

0:11:02.820,0:11:06.900
The price they paid is what I am enjoying today.

0:11:06.900,0:11:16.520
So the price you are paying today, children yet unborn also need to enjoy them.

0:11:16.520,0:11:20.080
This is why we are saying that the world is coming to an end because everyone is copying.

0:11:20.080,0:11:24.180
No one is patient enough to wait for God, to hear from God.

0:11:24.180,0:11:27.180
You copy little things.

0:11:27.180,0:11:32.500
Even in the world today, we encourage copying.

0:11:32.500,0:11:35.520
When your children want to sit for an exam,

0:11:35.520,0:11:39.320
they are given opportunity for first choice and second choice.

0:11:39.320,0:11:43.820

0:11:52.220,0:11:54.420
Where are we going?

0:11:54.420,0:11:58.480
So it will be too soon for you now to say this is my calling.

0:11:58.480,0:12:01.120
What I'm doing is what I'm called from Heaven to do.

0:12:01.120,0:12:06.000
No! The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.

0:12:06.000,0:12:15.060
Tell you neighbour: The beginner is not the owner of the job but the finisher.

0:12:15.060,0:12:19.080
When you start, you begin to run faster faster faster

0:12:19.080,0:12:22.640
and someone has been struggling to get to you.

0:12:22.640,0:12:29.160
But before getting to the end where you can receive the award, you suddenly fall down.

0:12:29.160,0:12:39.060
The one that is coming with effort passes you, and he will be the one to receive the award.

0:12:39.060,0:12:47.700
Issue of faith is an issue we should critically look into and see how it really affects your life.

0:12:47.700,0:12:52.280
Are you living by faith? Are you a faith man?

0:12:52.280,0:13:00.300
If you continue to copy and you are not patient enough to listen to God for direction,

0:13:00.300,0:13:06.700
you will go well and still come back where you started.

0:13:06.700,0:13:11.360
This is why you see people are up and down.

0:13:11.360,0:13:16.400
There is so much epileptic system of life today.

0:13:16.400,0:13:25.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:25.240,0:13:29.380
A copy cannot stand the test of time.

0:13:29.380,0:13:34.640
This is why when challenges come, you lament and complain.

0:13:34.640,0:13:41.780
Challenges will come but a copy man cannot stand the challenges.

0:13:41.780,0:13:48.780
Who is the master of copy? Man is the master of copy.

0:13:48.780,0:13:57.500
But the master of original is God - God is the master.

0:13:57.500,0:14:07.660
No one can be built up with philosophy or theory about the Word.

0:14:07.660,0:14:12.360
You cannot be built up to walk with Jesus; it's not possible.

0:14:12.360,0:14:17.820
Or on the history - it is the history in the Bible that you rely on.

0:14:17.820,0:14:24.740
You want to hear story about Elijah and others. No!

0:14:24.740,0:14:32.160
The Word must live in you, and you must live in the Word to walk with Jesus.

As the deer panteth for the water

0:14:46.300,0:14:57.040
So my soul longeth after Thee

0:14:57.040,0:15:04.880
You alone are my heart's desire

0:15:04.880,0:15:12.640
And I long to worship Thee

You alone are my strength and shield

0:15:23.380,0:15:35.860
To You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire

0:15:44.080,0:15:52.480
And I long to worship Thee

0:15:52.480,0:15:54.760
Hallelujah

0:15:54.760,0:15:58.560
You're my Friend

0:15:58.560,0:16:03.040
And You are my Brother

0:16:03.040,0:16:09.660
Even though You are a King

0:16:09.660,0:16:12.960
Sing on - I love you...

0:16:12.960,0:16:20.420
I love You more than any other

0:16:20.420,0:16:28.180
So much more than anything

0:16:28.180,0:16:38.620
You alone are my strength and shield

0:16:38.620,0:16:49.740
To You alone may my spirit yield

0:16:49.740,0:16:58.120
You alone are my heart's desire

0:16:58.120,0:17:08.840
And I long to worship Thee

0:17:08.840,0:17:11.120
Hallelujah!

0:17:11.120,0:17:15.300
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:17:15.300,0:17:24.780
We can only be a part of Christ when the Word dominates us.

0:17:24.780,0:17:31.760
You become part of Christ; then you can bring Christ on the scene.

0:17:31.760,0:17:36.540
"Jesus!" - you see Him on the scene.

0:17:36.540,0:17:39.960
Instantly!

0:17:39.960,0:17:47.000
You can only make a very thorough decision, true decision

0:17:47.000,0:17:55.180
when you begin to see each day as if it were your last day on earth.

0:17:55.180,0:18:00.300
But just look at yourself - "today's my last day on earth" -

0:18:00.300,0:18:02.340
you know you are going to meet Him,

0:18:02.340,0:18:06.100
so just take a decision. Let it be in your heart any time.

0:18:06.100,0:18:08.900
You say, "I want to accept Jesus, I want to follow Him.

0:18:08.900,0:18:12.080
Today is my last day on earth, I want to follow Him".

0:18:12.080,0:18:17.740
Just take that decision with the word "today is my last day on earth".

0:18:17.740,0:18:21.560
If today is your last day on earth, what else again.

0:18:21.560,0:18:24.100
You are finished with the world.

0:18:24.100,0:18:30.920
Over there. And He is the head of the immaterial world.

0:18:30.920,0:18:33.140
He is the head.

0:18:33.140,0:18:35.880
Invisible world - He is the head.

0:18:35.880,0:18:39.100
And you leave the visible world to the invisible world.

0:18:39.100,0:18:40.460
You will meet Him there.

0:18:40.460,0:18:44.280
Just take that decision today: "Today is my last day on earth."

0:18:44.280,0:18:47.240
You will stop all what you do; you accept Him.

0:18:47.240,0:18:53.600
Take that decision with this word of encouragement.

0:18:53.600,0:19:01.880
Your heart needs to be free; you need a free heart, free spirit to accept Jesus.

0:19:01.880,0:19:04.680
You are not free.

0:19:04.680,0:19:11.320
Free spirit can only attract Jesus - free spirit.

0:19:11.320,0:19:18.320
Your spirit is not free. So many things are going on in your heart.

0:19:18.320,0:19:26.360
A free spirit attracts the Spirit of God.

0:19:26.360,0:19:30.780
Free spirit.

0:19:30.780,0:19:46.720
To accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour, begin to meditate on what you hear now.

0:19:46.720,0:19:50.680
The message you are receiving, begin to meditate on it, not think.

0:19:50.680,0:19:53.900
I'm not saying begin to think about the message.

0:19:53.900,0:19:55.540
No! Don't think about the message.

0:19:55.540,0:20:06.500
You can only think about your situation but meditate on the Word you hear now.

0:20:06.500,0:20:18.120
Turn it over and over again in your heart.

0:20:18.120,0:20:24.940
If you don't turn it over and over, it will remain on your lips.

0:20:24.940,0:20:33.000
There is a difference between the Word on your lips and the Word in your heart.

0:20:33.000,0:20:39.500
It is the Word in your heart that would release the authority.

0:20:39.500,0:20:46.640
There is power in your mouth; the belief in your heart is released by faith out of your mouth.

0:20:46.640,0:20:50.420
Let someone say, "There is power in my mouth;

0:20:50.420,0:20:58.460
the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.

0:20:58.460,0:20:59.780
Again.

0:20:59.780,0:21:05.360
There is power in my mouth; the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.

0:21:05.360,0:21:08.240
There's power in my mouth

0:21:08.240,0:21:13.280
When you say, "In Jesus' name! Amen!", power comes.

0:21:13.280,0:21:21.880
But before that power can be in your mouth, the belief in your heart must be released by faith.

0:21:21.880,0:21:28.360
If the belief is released by faith, it comes from your mouth again.

0:21:28.360,0:21:37.980
There's power in my mouth; the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.

0:21:37.980,0:21:48.480
So this means faith is believing with my heart and confessing with my mouth.

0:21:48.480,0:22:02.380
There's power in my mouth; the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.

0:22:02.380,0:22:08.000
So any moment from now we will begin to see what we are talking about - the power.

0:22:08.000,0:22:13.420
"Be healed!" - You see shaking.

0:22:13.420,0:22:16.580
"I'm healed, I am healed!" -  How does this come about?

0:22:16.580,0:22:23.600
Power in the mouth comes when faith release the belief in our heart.

0:22:23.600,0:22:26.760
"I believe" - No!

0:22:26.760,0:22:30.200
Faith must release that belief before you believe.

0:22:30.200,0:22:34.760
But today, we Christians believe without faith product.

0:22:34.760,0:22:41.800
Faith must bring that belief before we can say, "I believe, Jesus is Lord!"

0:22:41.800,0:22:46.040
If it is not released by faith and you say you believe Jesus is Lord,

0:22:46.040,0:22:48.620
you are speaking to yourself.

0:22:48.620,0:22:51.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:51.560,0:23:06.600
To speak of Jesus, faith must release that belief before it becomes a product or machinery.

0:23:06.600,0:23:11.160
"I believe, Jesus is Lord" - by what authority?

0:23:11.160,0:23:21.980
Yes, the authority is: The belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.

0:23:21.980,0:23:25.640
Because belief rests in the heart.

0:23:25.640,0:23:28.780
There's no other place for Him.

0:23:28.780,0:23:32.360
That's the only place where He lives. He lives in our heart,

0:23:32.360,0:23:39.280
and it is released by faith out of our mouth.

0:23:39.280,0:23:42.920
Let's start something. Are you ready to start with me?

0:23:42.920,0:23:45.960
We will continue to build on it.

0:23:45.960,0:23:52.000
Meditation is of heart. Thinking is of mental assent.

0:23:52.000,0:23:54.920
Faith is not a mental assent.

0:23:54.920,0:24:01.400
Faith is not an intellectual agreement.

0:24:01.400,0:24:07.940
To have this faith now, all what you have seen and heard since morning,

0:24:07.940,0:24:12.080
and what you are hearing now, begin to meditate on it.

0:24:12.080,0:24:19.420
Meditation is of heart, not of mental assent.

0:24:19.420,0:24:25.400
The faith bracelet I gave you is not of mouth or of mental assent.

0:24:25.400,0:24:30.280
It is of heart and when your heart is engaged in something,

0:24:30.280,0:24:35.600
your body, face, appearance, faculty will remain quiet.

0:24:35.600,0:24:39.020
No one will know you are saying or doing something.

0:24:39.020,0:24:42.440
But today...

0:24:42.440,0:24:46.140
It's not of your heart but of your mouth.

0:24:46.140,0:24:49.820
Meditation is a visit with God.

0:24:49.820,0:24:54.360
If you want to visit Jesus, just meditate in His Word.

0:24:54.360,0:24:57.460
You will soon see Him, you will visit Him.

0:24:57.460,0:25:01.840
Come on, brother. Come here.

0:25:01.840,0:25:05.880
Stand here. I want to demonstrate something.

0:25:05.880,0:25:07.260
Stand here.

0:25:07.260,0:25:12.780
Come, stand here.

0:25:12.780,0:25:17.300
You see this lady is very close to this man.

0:25:17.300,0:25:24.960
Take, for example, that this man is Jesus, and she is close to Him.

0:25:24.960,0:25:30.500
My brother is a bit far; further than this woman.

0:25:30.500,0:25:36.140
If you want to go to Jesus, you will get there before this man.

0:25:36.140,0:25:48.300
So if we start meditation now, it will depend on the distance you are to Jesus.

0:25:48.300,0:25:51.960
Meditation is a visit with who?

0:25:51.960,0:25:53.600
With God.

0:25:53.600,0:25:55.260
You want to go and visit Him.

0:25:55.260,0:25:59.540
If the sister starts to meditate on God's Word,

0:25:59.540,0:26:02.520
and this man also starts to meditate on God's Word,

0:26:02.520,0:26:05.540
this woman will get to Jesus before this man.

0:26:05.540,0:26:11.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:11.580,0:26:14.600
So therefore, this is just a visit with Him.

0:26:14.600,0:26:18.840
You want to go and visit Him. To start the visit, it is not by running.

0:26:18.840,0:26:21.840
You cannot run to Jesus, you cannot cry to Jesus.

0:26:21.840,0:26:23.720
Crying cannot take you to Jesus.

0:26:23.720,0:26:25.800
Dancing cannot take you to Jesus.

0:26:25.800,0:26:28.240
Running cannot take you to Jesus. Walking cannot take you to Jesus.

0:26:28.240,0:26:30.440
Eloquent speech cannot take you there.

0:26:30.440,0:26:34.600
If you memorise the Bible, it cannot take you to Jesus.

0:26:34.600,0:26:41.220
The only thing that can take you there is when you begin to meditate on God's Word

0:26:41.220,0:26:46.920
and turn it over and over again in your heart.

0:26:46.920,0:26:51.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:51.100,0:27:00.400
Meditation is of man's heart. Man's heart means man's spirit.

0:27:00.400,0:27:10.480
Like I have said,  Bible faith is of man's heart - man's spirit.

0:27:10.480,0:27:14.120
And someone can also be here.

0:27:14.120,0:27:22.140
So if this woman calls, "Jesus!", He would likely hear it before this man.

0:27:22.140,0:27:30.620
I told you that faith is a Heavenly currency that purchases Heavenly resources.

0:27:30.620,0:27:33.120
What are we purchasing?

0:27:33.120,0:27:37.780
Salvation, healing, blessing and  prosperity.

0:27:37.780,0:27:42.040
They are Heavenly resources.

0:27:42.040,0:27:47.320
The amount of faith you have is the amount of Heavenly resources.

0:27:47.320,0:27:51.400
She seems to have more than this man.

0:27:51.400,0:27:55.720
This woman is having more Heavenly currency than this man.

0:27:55.720,0:27:58.820
If she just says, "Jesus!", she will likely cash.

0:27:58.820,0:28:06.500
This man will say, "Jesus!" 20 times before he cashes what this woman cashes saying, "Jesus!" once.

0:28:06.500,0:28:08.720
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:28:08.720,0:28:13.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:13.580,0:28:34.780
Faith is an object that grows and develops in our heart or man's spirit.

0:28:34.780,0:28:44.320
Heart means spirit. As you know, spirit of man means heart.

0:28:44.320,0:28:48.140
So what I'm doing here now, by the time I reach there and say, "Jesus!",

0:28:48.140,0:28:49.660
the man begins to walk.

0:28:49.660,0:28:51.480
That does not mean that you don't have faith.

0:28:51.480,0:28:56.960
Maybe you are likely a bit further.

0:28:56.960,0:29:00.940
Maybe I'm a bit closer than you.

0:29:00.940,0:29:03.360
That's why when I say, "Jesus!", He answers.

0:29:03.360,0:29:08.000
You think you cannot do the same. You can do it but you are a bit further.

0:29:08.000,0:29:17.020
You just need to begin to meditate on God's Word and turn it over and over again.

0:29:17.020,0:29:19.160
You may overtake me.

0:29:19.160,0:29:23.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:23.340,0:29:27.580
No one is born without that seed.

0:29:27.580,0:29:30.440
S-E-E-D

0:29:30.440,0:29:35.900
It is there, but maybe it is dormant.

0:29:35.900,0:29:41.300
It's just like a man saying, "I am poor" because you don't have money in the pocket.

0:29:41.300,0:29:46.440
No! A man that is poor is not a man that does not have money in the pocket.

0:29:46.440,0:29:49.200
It's a man without vision.

0:29:49.200,0:29:53.040
It is when our vision is closed - when it comes to an issue of blessing and

0:29:53.040,0:29:57.500
you don't have a vision for that, that's when you are poor.

0:29:57.500,0:30:00.160
So in the same way, people say, "I don't have faith".

0:30:00.160,0:30:01.980
Who told you that you don't have faith?

0:30:01.980,0:30:07.620
It's dormant - you have faith.

0:30:07.620,0:30:12.340
Faith activates prayer. Write it down.

0:30:12.340,0:30:17.440
You talk of activation. Faith activates prayer.

0:30:17.440,0:30:21.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:21.800,0:30:32.800
90% of my teaching is about faith because that is the only thing that pleases God.

0:30:32.800,0:30:36.100
You don't need to go to Heaven to see Jesus.

0:30:36.100,0:30:41.340
Religious people believe they must go to Heaven to see God.

0:30:41.340,0:30:52.920
Jesus came to restore the fellowship and relationship between God and man.

0:30:52.920,0:30:55.680
We are coming from a religious angle - all of us -

0:30:55.680,0:31:02.860
and we refuse to leave this idea of religionism - the idea of this is how it should be.

0:31:02.860,0:31:06.700
Yesterday's idea - we are still carrying it on to Christianity.

0:31:06.700,0:31:13.060
There is a difference between religion and Christianity.

0:31:13.060,0:31:17.680
That is why we receive so many attacks today.

0:31:17.680,0:31:21.400
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:31:21.400,0:31:24.500
If you are not close to Jesus, you don't have a problem.

0:31:24.500,0:31:35.400
But when you try to be close to Him, you are in trouble - in the hands of satan.

0:31:35.400,0:31:46.300
That is why there is so much attack today on Christianity - everywhere.

0:31:46.300,0:31:51.200
With that, Christians are not united.

0:31:51.200,0:31:56.140
So who is the Christian? Christianity  is unity.

0:31:56.140,0:32:00.020
Christianity is not disunity.

0:32:00.020,0:32:02.820
Christianity is unity. Tell you neighbour.

0:32:02.820,0:32:08.660
Christianity is unity.

0:32:08.660,0:32:15.800
That is how we know a Christian. You can see them. They unite by love.

0:32:15.800,0:32:20.100
They greet by love. Their love sees beyond hatred.

0:32:20.100,0:32:27.600
Their love sees beyond attack. When you attack me, the love in me sees beyond that.

0:32:27.600,0:32:31.700
So that is it. Their love sees beyond.

0:32:31.700,0:32:36.300
But religious love does not see beyond attack.

0:32:36.300,0:32:39.780
When you attack them, they attack you back.

0:32:39.780,0:32:42.320
It is what you do to them, they do to you.

0:32:42.320,0:32:47.700
But in our case, when you do evil to us, we do good to you.

0:32:47.700,0:32:56.120
That is the Christianity that Jesus left behind - love your neighbour as yourself.

0:32:56.120,0:33:01.800
Your neighbour could be your enemy or those who do not share the same faith with you.

0:33:01.800,0:33:04.820
"Love them all" - this is what Jesus said,

0:33:04.820,0:33:10.460
This is the teaching of Jesus. What are we doing now?

0:33:10.460,0:33:15.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:15.040,0:33:17.020
Love your neighbour as yourself.

0:33:17.020,0:33:21.340
Your neighbour could be your enemy or those who do not share the same faith with you.

0:33:21.340,0:33:23.520
Love them first.

0:33:23.520,0:33:27.660
Don't say, "Because he's not a Christian, I don't want to see him".

0:33:27.660,0:33:30.480
You don't want to have anything to do with him.

0:33:30.480,0:33:34.860
Love sees beyond.

0:33:34.860,0:33:44.380
It is when I love you, you can know who I am and the God I am serving.

0:33:44.380,0:33:50.160
I can only win your soul when you are close to me - not at a distance.

0:33:50.160,0:33:57.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:57.020,0:34:04.320
Draw me close to You

0:34:04.320,0:34:11.460
Never let me go

0:34:11.460,0:34:18.480
I lay it all down again

0:34:18.480,0:34:25.720
To hear You say that I'm Your friend

0:34:25.720,0:34:31.380
You are my desire

0:34:31.380,0:34:33.940
Lord Jesus

0:34:33.940,0:34:41.980
No one else will do

0:34:41.980,0:34:50.080
Nothing else will take Your place

0:34:50.080,0:34:58.540
To feel the warmth of Your embrace

0:34:58.540,0:35:02.680
Help me find a way

0:35:02.680,0:35:10.520
Bring me back to You

0:35:10.520,0:35:19.080
You're all I want

0:35:19.080,0:35:28.180
You're all I ever needed

0:35:28.180,0:35:35.360
You're all I want

0:35:35.360,0:35:44.720
Help me know You are near

0:35:44.720,0:35:50.960
You're all I want

0:35:50.960,0:35:53.140
You are my joy, You are my peace

0:35:53.140,0:36:01.160
You're all I ever needed

0:36:01.160,0:36:08.340
You're all I want

0:36:08.340,0:36:18.340
Help me know You are near

0:36:18.340,0:36:21.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:21.900,0:36:29.660
You will see that you must stop thinking about where you have been

0:36:29.660,0:36:34.740
and begin to think about where you are going now.

0:36:34.740,0:36:38.900
That's the answer and the way out.

0:36:38.900,0:36:47.580
When you look at where you are coming from, there's nothing glorifying God.

0:36:47.580,0:36:50.400
Meditate about where you are going

0:36:50.400,0:36:55.660
and stop thinking about where you are coming from.

0:36:55.660,0:37:01.280
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:37:01.280,0:37:05.620
What does it take you to accept Jesus  genuinely?

0:37:05.620,0:37:11.580
The reason why it is difficult is because we believe in majority.

0:37:11.580,0:37:14.540
You have good friends, bad friends,

0:37:14.540,0:37:18.440
those who can influence you. Because of them, you cannot say no.

0:37:18.440,0:37:20.920
Whatever they tell you is what you will follow.

0:37:20.920,0:37:27.500
And you are going to be responsible for what you give your life to.

0:37:27.500,0:37:31.160
You will give account on the last day.

0:37:31.160,0:37:43.780
See Jesus as the final say and let us give all our heart.

0:37:43.780,0:37:46.740
Right now, open your lips and say after me:

0:37:46.740,0:37:53.840
Lord Jesus, I'm a sinner.

0:37:53.840,0:37:58.780
Come into my heart.

0:37:58.780,0:38:02.080
Save my soul.

0:38:02.080,0:38:08.860
Lord Jesus, save my soul.

0:38:08.860,0:38:21.560
Make me a channel - a channel of shining light where there is darkness.

0:38:21.560,0:38:31.480
Make me a channel - a channel of obedience where there is disobedience.

0:38:31.480,0:38:40.880
Make me a channel - a channel of pardon where there is injury.

0:38:40.880,0:38:43.920
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:38:43.920,0:38:45.440
Amen.

0:38:53.440,0:38:59.280
Being a channel of shining light, out there in darkness.

0:38:59.280,0:39:02.780
We are in the world, we are not part of them.

0:39:02.780,0:39:06.320
Because in the world - full of darkness.

0:39:06.320,0:39:16.280
But when you are a channel - a channel of shining light - and you're walking in the world,

0:39:16.280,0:39:25.440
a channel of shining light walking in the midst of darkness.

0:39:25.440,0:39:32.840
There's so much injury and injustice, and now you're a channel of pardon.

0:39:32.840,0:39:37.000
So it is time now to give yourself to prayer.

0:39:37.000,0:39:44.960
Where you are accused wrongly - temptation, persecution - give yourself to prayer.

0:39:44.960,0:39:47.500
Thank You, Lord. You may be seated.

0:39:47.500,0:39:50.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:50.980,0:39:54.440
Begin to meditate. That will keep you busy.

0:39:54.440,0:39:57.920
There is nothing you have not done or seen.

0:39:57.920,0:40:02.720
The only thing you have not done well is your relationship with God.

0:40:02.720,0:40:04.560
It is time now.

0:40:04.560,0:40:06.240
Begin to meditate.

0:40:06.240,0:40:10.340
Lord Jesus, come into my heart. I am a sinner.

0:40:10.340,0:40:16.000
Come into my heart; wash me with Your precious blood.

0:40:16.000,0:40:17.900
Save my soul.

0:40:17.900,0:40:25.220
Lord Jesus, make me a channel of direction where there is no direction,

0:40:25.220,0:40:32.740
a channel of way where there is no way,

0:40:32.740,0:40:37.800
a channel of pardon where there is injustice.

0:40:37.800,0:40:41.280
Begin to refill yourself now.

0:40:41.280,0:40:46.880
Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. Come into my heart.

0:40:46.880,0:40:51.740
Don't say come into me. He lives in our heart.

0:40:51.740,0:40:53.660
Come into my heart.

0:40:53.660,0:40:55.560
Wash me with your precious blood.

0:40:55.560,0:40:59.180
That precious blood is the blood of Jesus.

0:40:59.180,0:41:01.160
And save my soul.

0:41:01.160,0:41:05.000
If you are a type that lies; you can lie anywhere -

0:41:05.000,0:41:10.620
make me a channel - a channel of truth where there is lying.

0:41:10.620,0:41:14.740
Before you know it, where you want to lie, you will resist it

0:41:14.740,0:41:16.580
because you have called for help.

0:41:16.580,0:41:20.560
You have now become a channel of truth. You cannot lie again.

0:41:20.560,0:41:24.500
So you begin to fill yourself - fill yourself.

0:41:24.500,0:41:28.440
Make me a channel of truth where there is lying,

0:41:28.440,0:41:33.060
a channel of blessing where there is poverty.

0:41:33.060,0:41:38.080
Before you know it, you become complete two natures.

0:41:38.080,0:41:42.520
Because right now, it is like it is only one nature that is working.

0:41:42.520,0:41:44.100
Are you with me?

0:41:44.100,0:41:50.640
I said you have two natures but only one is working. The other one is shut down.

0:41:50.640,0:41:53.060
Which one is working? Human nature.

0:41:53.060,0:41:56.980
Your divine nature is shut down.

0:41:56.980,0:41:58.600
It is shut down.

0:41:58.600,0:42:02.340
That's why it's difficult for you to meditate. You can't meditate.

0:42:02.340,0:42:05.760
You struggle to say it in your heart because you cannot.

0:42:05.760,0:42:11.360
You struggle to say it because you are not used to it.

0:42:11.360,0:42:18.740
Every human being has two natures but today, people's divine nature is shut down.

0:42:18.740,0:42:25.100
It's only the human nature that is working, and human nature cannot pray.

0:42:25.100,0:42:28.580
The Bible says we don't know how to say a word in prayer.

0:42:28.580,0:42:33.660
We don't know how to pray but the Holy Spirit helps us to pray - that is divine nature.

0:42:33.660,0:42:38.500
We cannot meditate with human nature. You can only meditate with divine nature.

0:42:38.500,0:42:40.940
Because divine nature is of man's heart.

0:42:40.940,0:42:47.560
Divine nature is of man's spirit while human nature is this mental assent.

0:42:47.560,0:42:51.320
Memorising things - that is human nature.

0:42:51.320,0:42:54.440
That's why you have time to say, "Jesus, kill my enemies,

0:42:54.440,0:42:59.040
divide them, kill them, I sent back to sender."

0:42:59.040,0:43:02.180
Because there is nothing human nature cannot say.

0:43:02.180,0:43:06.860
It's killing, killing, killing; destroy, destroy, destroy.

0:43:06.860,0:43:12.340
The human nature wants to retaliate; they derive joy in retaliation

0:43:12.340,0:43:24.980
but your divine nature leaves all for God.

0:43:24.980,0:43:30.820
Divine nature, today, seems to be dormant, unused.

0:43:30.820,0:43:33.080
We need to revive it, we need to clean it.

0:43:33.080,0:43:40.860
We need to clean it very well, to revive it for action.

0:43:40.860,0:43:43.640
Thank you. God bless you.

0:43:43.640,0:43:47.260
I want to pray for your spirit and your heart.

0:43:47.260,0:43:52.000
Father, rescue my people.

0:43:52.000,0:43:56.460
Rescue my people.

0:43:56.460,0:44:02.240
You know you need rescue - you need rescue.

0:44:02.240,0:44:06.540
Lord I want to be like Jesus

0:44:06.540,0:44:08.760
Inner my heart

0:44:08.760,0:44:11.320
That is divine nature.

0:44:11.320,0:44:25.740
Inner my heart

0:44:25.740,0:44:34.920
Lord I want to be like Jesus

0:44:34.920,0:44:40.740
Inner my heart

0:44:40.740,0:44:47.420
