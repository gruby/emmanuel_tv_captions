0:00:00.000,0:00:04.240
During the mass prayer, while Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying,

0:00:04.240,0:00:11.120
he noticed a lady of short stature, praying among the congregation.

0:00:11.120,0:00:12.820
How are you?

0:00:12.820,0:00:14.220
What are you doing for a living?

0:00:14.220,0:00:16.640
I am a student, 300 level.

0:00:16.640,0:00:18.280
300 level?

0:00:18.280,0:00:19.520

0:00:27.420,0:00:29.400
Watch your screen.

0:00:29.400,0:00:32.520
So, you study what?

0:00:32.520,0:00:33.560
Computer Science.

0:00:33.560,0:00:34.740
I want to be your friend.

0:00:34.740,0:00:36.060
Thank you, sir.

0:00:36.060,0:00:37.320
I want to be your friend.

0:00:37.320,0:00:38.020
Thank you, sir.

0:00:38.020,0:00:40.340
Is there any way we can be of help?

0:00:40.340,0:00:45.020
The area I need your assistance, if you can assist me, immediately I finish school,

0:00:45.020,0:00:50.020
I don’t want to rely on somebody; I want to have something to do.

0:00:50.020,0:00:53.540
OK, when you finish the university, you want to have something to do?

0:00:53.540,0:00:56.220
So, you don't want to be looking for a job?

0:00:56.220,0:00:57.320
OK, don't worry.

0:00:57.320,0:01:00.000
We will make sure, we get you established. OK?

0:01:00.000,0:01:00.540
Thank you, sir.

0:01:00.540,0:01:06.220
People that believe they are tall, they will come to you and ask you for help.

0:01:06.220,0:01:09.640
The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua

0:01:09.640,0:01:10.780
Come on.

0:01:10.780,0:01:13.700
Where is your friend?

0:01:13.700,0:01:18.100
Stepping forward is the friend the lady mentioned to the man of God.

0:01:18.100,0:01:19.980
Thank you very much.

0:01:19.980,0:01:22.300
Let them sit down.

0:01:22.300,0:01:25.560
The two friends sit down together on one chair.

0:01:25.560,0:01:29.000
Look for those who need you most.

0:01:29.000,0:01:31.480
No matter how small...

0:01:31.480,0:01:35.320
Many are out there in need of what you have.

0:01:35.320,0:01:36.040
Look for them.

0:01:36.040,0:01:41.860
Tell you neighbour: "Look for them".

0:01:41.860,0:01:46.120
Moved with compassion, Prophet T.B. Joshua invited the two friends

0:01:46.120,0:01:49.580
to come back to The SCOAN the next day,

0:01:49.600,0:01:54.880
interested to know more about their plight, and how he can be of assistance to them.

0:01:54.880,0:01:57.160
Let's hear what they have to say.

0:01:57.160,0:01:59.680
My name is Ehizua Christiana.

0:01:59.680,0:02:01.900
I am from Edo State.

0:02:01.900,0:02:06.580
I attended Ambrose University, Ekpoma. I studied Political Science Education.

0:02:06.580,0:02:12.640
I finished in 2007/2008 and I served 2008/2009.

0:02:12.640,0:02:15.460
The person next to me is Evelyn Cosey Otekpe.

0:02:15.460,0:02:20.120
She is 27 years old. She is a student of Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma,

0:02:20.120,0:02:22.640
studying Computer Science.

0:02:22.640,0:02:26.840
I met her 4 years ago when I was in school.

0:02:26.840,0:02:29.500
I saw her and I asked her, “What is happening?”

0:02:29.500,0:02:32.120
She said that she did not see anybody that would pick her up; that is why she was crying.

0:02:32.120,0:02:33.560
She didn’t have anyone.

0:02:33.560,0:02:34.800
Who was crying?

0:02:34.800,0:02:36.340
My good friend Evelyn.

0:02:36.340,0:02:37.540
She was crying

0:02:37.540,0:02:41.180
and when she was shedding tears, I said: “Don’t worry; I will be with you.

0:02:41.180,0:02:45.000
I promise to be with you till death does us part”.

0:02:45.000,0:02:48.260
And since then, I’ve been with her, doing all things for her -

0:02:48.260,0:02:52.440
fetching water for her, buying food, washing clothes.

0:02:52.440,0:02:55.760
Whenever it is difficult, she would call me and I would be there for her.

0:02:55.760,0:02:59.120
To fetch water from the stream - I would do everything for her.

0:02:59.120,0:03:02.960
Even right now, she’s staying with my parents.

0:03:02.960,0:03:06.900
She was rejected because many people drive her away; they don't like to see her.

0:03:06.900,0:03:09.760
That is why she has nobody to help her.

0:03:09.760,0:03:12.800
What actually drew your attention to this sister?

0:03:12.800,0:03:15.200
Any time I wash her clothes, I feel joy.

0:03:15.200,0:03:17.540
Anywhere I go, we go together.

0:03:17.540,0:03:20.100
If she has anything she wants to do, she will call me.

0:03:20.100,0:03:22.240
I make her happy.

0:03:22.240,0:03:25.480
If we are going out, I will ‘back her’.

0:03:25.480,0:03:28.520
Tell us the reason for which you 'back her'.

0:03:28.520,0:03:32.600
She finds it difficult to walk long distances.

0:03:32.600,0:03:34.780
That is why you 'back her' while you are moving together?

0:03:34.780,0:03:35.960
Yes.

0:03:35.960,0:03:40.060
Even now, I’m looking for a job – it’s not easy. Because if I had a good job now,

0:03:40.060,0:03:42.760
I would have the opportunity to take care of her very well.

0:03:42.760,0:03:45.860
She prays for me. Sometimes, if I’m not around or if I forget to pray,

0:03:45.860,0:03:47.300
she is the one that will pray for me.

0:03:47.300,0:03:49.140
She even helps me to write prayer requests.

0:03:49.140,0:03:51.240
Sometimes, she would just ask what my problem was.

0:03:51.240,0:03:52.000
I would tell her.

0:03:52.000,0:03:54.380
She would say, "Do not worry". She would fast for me, pray for me.

0:03:54.380,0:03:57.720
She would say, "God will see you through".

0:03:57.720,0:04:02.280
Can you explain to us how you and your friend got to know about the SCOAN?

0:04:02.280,0:04:07.500
We watch Emmanuel TV to see what Prophet T.B. Joshua is doing -

0:04:07.500,0:04:11.880
encouraging people, playing with them, the less privileged,

0:04:11.880,0:04:15.280
the disabled, the handicapped – he’s there for them.

0:04:15.280,0:04:18.200
That is why she said, “Christy, we must visit The Synagogue”.

0:04:18.200,0:04:22.060
I said, “OK, I will come with you”. That is why we came to Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:04:22.060,0:04:25.520
When we came, it was so difficult for us to enter the church.

0:04:25.520,0:04:29.040
We were together on Sunday morning.

0:04:29.040,0:04:31.920
The ushers saw her. They said that she should go to the children’s department.

0:04:31.920,0:04:34.760
She is 27 years old. She cannot go to the children's department.

0:04:34.760,0:04:37.940
She is a student at the university. I was shouting.

0:04:37.940,0:04:39.340
It was so difficult.

0:04:39.340,0:04:43.080
I’m happy the man of God discovered her because it is not easy.

0:04:43.080,0:04:48.440
I’m here because of my friend and I know that God will use the man of God to help us in our need.

0:04:48.440,0:04:51.560
Can you tell us your name, your age, and where you come from?

0:04:51.560,0:04:56.700
Cosy Evelyn Otekpe. I am 27 years old.

0:04:56.700,0:04:58.640
I’m from Edo State, Nigeria.

0:04:58.640,0:05:01.860
I attend Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma, Edo State, Nigeria.

0:05:01.860,0:05:06.300
I study Computer Science. I’m now in my final year.

0:05:06.300,0:05:08.740
What do you have to say about what your friend has said?

0:05:08.740,0:05:11.740
My friend has said everything.

0:05:11.740,0:05:17.600
I thank God for giving me such a wonderful friend.

0:05:17.600,0:05:23.520
Life was very horrible for me because people reject me.

0:05:23.520,0:05:32.160
Before I could get a bike or a bus, I would spend an hour before somebody would come and help me.

0:05:32.160,0:05:35.000
But since I met her, she charters buses.

0:05:35.000,0:05:36.820
People see me and run away.

0:05:36.820,0:05:42.920
Some pick on me and try to mock me, saying:

0:05:42.920,0:05:46.380
"Can you see somebody like this?" or: "Where is this one from?"

0:05:46.380,0:05:51.960
But since I met her, she has been doing all these jobs -

0:05:51.960,0:05:56.960
helping me to get a bike, chartering a bus for me, fetching water for me

0:05:56.960,0:06:01.140
helping me to wash clothes - because I cannot trek long distances.

0:06:01.140,0:06:06.860
If not because of her, life would have been miserable for me.

0:06:06.860,0:06:12.700
Ever since I met her, God has used her in a wonderful way.

0:06:12.700,0:06:16.620
At times, she washes my clothes,

0:06:16.620,0:06:23.520
she backs me because I cannot walk long distances, she gives me encouragement.

0:06:23.520,0:06:29.920
At times, when I think ‘It’s all over’, she makes me realise that there is still hope.

0:06:29.920,0:06:31.500
There is not much more to say.

0:06:31.500,0:06:35.040
All I have to say is that I give glory to God

0:06:35.040,0:06:38.840
for giving me a friend who is so caring like this.

0:06:38.840,0:06:40.420
I thank God for everything.

0:06:40.420,0:06:45.520
I watch Emmanuel TV in my friend’s house.

0:06:45.520,0:06:50.780
I saw the way Pastor T.B. Joshua takes care of the physically challenged -

0:06:50.780,0:06:54.360
giving them money and sending them to school.

0:06:54.360,0:07:01.140
Because of that, I had the belief that, by the time I see him, God will use him to meet all my needs.

0:07:01.140,0:07:06.260
Ever since then, I’ve been forcing my friend to take me to The SCOAN.

0:07:06.260,0:07:11.760
During the second service, God did it for me and I was able to see Pastor T.B. Joshua.

0:07:11.760,0:07:19.440
But now I’ve seen him, I want God to use him to help me, right from now 'til I finish my school.

0:07:19.440,0:07:23.120
I want God to use him to establish me.

0:07:23.120,0:07:29.500
I want Pastor T.B. Joshua to help my friend.

0:07:29.500,0:07:46.220
I want to tell you today that Jesus values our little effort to honour Him when it is done in humility and faith.

0:07:46.220,0:07:51.980
Some people complain that there is no job after your education.

0:07:51.980,0:07:54.640
There are jobs; this is God’s job.

0:07:54.640,0:08:01.160
When you do this for one or two years, God will provide for you.

0:08:01.160,0:08:05.120
Take this challenge and see what God will do for you.

0:08:05.120,0:08:07.360
Let them come forward.

0:08:07.360,0:08:10.800
This sister needs to be established.

0:08:10.800,0:08:17.580
Together the two friends move forward to meet T.B. Joshua.

0:08:17.580,0:08:20.480
You know I told you, you are my best friend.

0:08:20.480,0:08:21.860
OK?

0:08:21.860,0:08:28.580
Well, I want to congratulate you. Thank you very much.

0:08:28.580,0:08:39.820
The Lord said to me that He wants to use this sister as a good example to the whole world.

0:08:39.820,0:08:41.600
This is God’s job.

0:08:41.600,0:08:48.180
The Lord said I should give you a car

0:08:48.180,0:08:54.240
and also give you 500 000 Naira.

0:08:54.240,0:09:00.320
Thank You, Jesus.

0:09:00.320,0:09:02.120
Thank you, Man of God.

0:09:02.120,0:09:04.780
No no, it is God.

0:09:04.780,0:09:07.560
I'm just a servant.

0:09:07.560,0:09:10.740
Give them the key.

0:09:10.740,0:09:14.600
The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua

0:09:14.600,0:09:16.160
Watch your screen.

0:09:16.160,0:09:19.000
Thank You, Jesus.

0:09:19.000,0:09:22.420
There is the key of the car being handed over.

0:09:22.420,0:09:34.560
The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua

0:09:34.560,0:09:42.680
The Emmanuel TV team presents the cash gift of 500 000 Naira to the two friends.

0:09:42.680,0:09:51.160
Watch your screen - 500 000 Naira, cash.

0:09:51.160,0:09:57.860
There is a brand new car

0:09:57.860,0:10:02.000
just outside the church auditorium here.

0:10:02.000,0:10:08.560
Prophet T.B. Joshua blessed them with a sum of 500 000 Naira and a brand new car.

0:10:08.560,0:10:10.520
Hallelujah.

0:10:10.520,0:10:14.880
Viewers, we wish to encourage you to do the same.

0:10:14.880,0:10:21.940
See your life as a solution to someone in trouble, and look for those who need you the most.

0:10:21.940,0:10:25.380
Emmanuel - God is with us.

0:10:25.380,0:10:30.460
We are communicating, telling you – do the same.

0:10:30.460,0:10:34.980
There are many little people in Africa here.

0:10:34.980,0:10:39.280
They are suffering.

0:10:39.280,0:10:44.620
They suffer rejection, isolation.

0:10:44.620,0:10:47.860
In Africa.

0:10:47.860,0:10:50.580
Why can you not walk in public?

0:10:50.580,0:10:54.740
Because of the rejection and intimidation.

0:10:54.740,0:10:58.500
So, thank you, sister.

0:10:58.500,0:11:00.640
I just need to thank you.

0:11:00.640,0:11:01.420
OK?

0:11:01.420,0:11:04.660
You are a part of our family.

0:11:04.660,0:11:06.400
We want to follow it up.

0:11:06.400,0:11:09.500
You will come here for holiday, we are one. OK?

0:11:09.500,0:11:10.120
Thank you.

0:11:10.120,0:11:13.160
Can I give you a kiss please?

0:11:13.160,0:11:18.120
Thank you.

0:11:18.120,0:11:24.780
Having received a cash gift of 500 000 Naira, a new car, and a promise of a lasting relationship,

0:11:24.780,0:11:31.040
the two friends, Miss Evelyn and Christiana, outside of the church auditorium cross the road

0:11:31.040,0:11:35.760
to see their beautiful new car.

0:11:35.760,0:11:42.280
Taking the key, Mrs Christiana unlocks the door, and helps her friend Evelyn to climb inside,

0:11:42.280,0:11:45.980
before she gets into the driver's seat.

0:11:45.980,0:11:53.900
Joyfully, the two friends Evelyn and Christiana wave from inside their brand new car.

0:11:53.900,0:11:56.500
What a life-changing encounter.

0:11:56.500,0:12:00.200
Thank You, Jesus!

0:12:00.200,0:12:02.540
Thank you, Man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:02.540,0:12:05.140
I have never dreamt of this. We give God the glory.

0:12:05.140,0:12:09.080
Thank You, Jesus.

0:12:09.080,0:12:10.240
To God be the glory.

0:12:10.240,0:12:16.100
You heard it from the lady, giving thanks to God Almighty for this unexpected gift.

0:12:16.100,0:12:21.960
TESTIMONY TIME

0:12:21.960,0:12:25.520
My name is Ehizua Christiana. We are from Edo state.

0:12:25.520,0:12:30.900
The persons standing beside me are her mother, her elder sister, and our in-law.

0:12:30.900,0:12:35.660
Can you just tell the viewers, especially those who were not watching Emmanuel TV,

0:12:35.660,0:12:39.620
what actually happened in the church here, the day you were blessed?

0:12:39.620,0:12:45.760
We received a car, N500 000 and six bags of rice.

0:12:45.760,0:12:50.920
This is the Bible and N500 000.

0:12:50.920,0:12:52.420
It was for you and your friend?

0:12:52.420,0:12:53.740
Yes.

0:12:53.740,0:12:56.940
My name is Cosy Evelyn Otekpe. I am from Edo State.

0:12:56.940,0:13:00.740
A student of Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma, Edo State.

0:13:00.740,0:13:02.480
Studying what? And at which year are you?

0:13:02.480,0:13:04.600
Computer Science, final year.

0:13:04.600,0:13:08.580
The woman standing beside me is my mother.

0:13:08.580,0:13:15.880
This is my wonderful elder sister, Christy's in-law and this is my wonderful friend.

0:13:15.880,0:13:24.300
Prophet T.B. Joshua blessed us with a gift of a car, N500 000 and also six bags of rice.

0:13:24.300,0:13:28.680
These are the particulars of the car.

0:13:28.680,0:13:31.500
We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.

0:13:31.500,0:13:35.140
Let's hear from your mother first.

0:13:35.140,0:13:39.200
My name is Agnes Oriwo. I'm 60 years of age.

0:13:39.200,0:13:44.040
I came from Edo State because of this little girl, my daughter.

0:13:44.040,0:13:46.640
I love her; she’s a clever girl.

0:13:46.640,0:13:51.960
Her father sued me to court and we divorced 13 years ago.

0:13:51.960,0:13:58.260
What happened was that he said: “I have one child who is not normal.”

0:13:58.260,0:13:59.220
Which child is that?

0:13:59.220,0:14:00.820
My daughter.

0:14:00.820,0:14:03.780
You mean that your husband was referring to your daughter Evelyn?

0:14:03.780,0:14:06.080
... that I have one that is not normal.

0:14:06.080,0:14:11.700
I wanted to faint but my mother held me and said: "Don't worry, things will be OK."

0:14:11.700,0:14:14.580
For the next three days, I didn’t eat anything.

0:14:14.580,0:14:19.440
After some time, they organized a church in my room.

0:14:19.440,0:14:29.340
Later, she joined the Redeemed Church and became a coordinator of children.

0:14:29.340,0:14:34.900
After that, she went outside preaching the Word of God.

0:14:34.900,0:14:37.640
I don’t know how to thank the man of God.

0:14:37.640,0:14:44.980
She is a burden to me; I don’t know what to say.

0:14:44.980,0:14:53.060
She is the one that encourages me and says that whatever a tall person can do, she can also do it.

0:14:53.060,0:15:02.340
On Sunday, I saw my daughter on Emmanuel TV and I started crying.

0:15:02.340,0:15:08.800
Prophet T.B. Joshua held my daughter and I said: "Ah, my daughter that was rejected!"

0:15:08.800,0:15:11.480
He held my daughter and asked her whether she wanted to be his friend.

0:15:11.480,0:15:19.700
I started crying. I didn’t know what to say or what to do.

0:15:19.700,0:15:28.060
I give God the glory; I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for my daughter’s life.

0:15:28.060,0:15:32.440
I didn’t expect that a man of God could do this.

0:15:32.440,0:15:35.440
OK, you can see the mother... Don't worry, mama.

0:15:35.440,0:15:38.780
It is a thing of joy.

0:15:38.780,0:15:40.720
I don't know what to say.

0:15:40.720,0:15:43.320
I give God the glory.

0:15:43.320,0:15:47.560
I thank God for what He has done in our life.

0:15:47.560,0:16:00.880
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave her N500 000, a car, six bags of rice and a Bible.

0:16:00.880,0:16:03.380
I was surprised.

0:16:03.380,0:16:06.100
I feel very happy.

0:16:06.100,0:16:13.360
That day I did not sleep, it was like I was dreaming.

0:16:13.360,0:16:16.800
And now, that the Lord has located you and blessed your daughter

0:16:16.800,0:16:19.760
- what word of advice do you have for parents like you

0:16:19.760,0:16:25.460
who also have children like this, of this stature and they are underrating what God can do in their life?

0:16:25.460,0:16:30.860
They should look up to God; there is no other way.

0:16:30.860,0:16:38.060
It’s God’s work. What a man cannot do, God will do it.

0:16:38.060,0:16:38.980
Thank you very much.

0:16:38.980,0:16:45.720
That is why God used Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua to do this kind of job.

0:16:45.720,0:16:48.960
I give God the glory.

0:16:48.960,0:16:50.400
Don't cry.

0:16:50.400,0:16:54.540
We thank God Almighty for what He has done, and I believe these are just tears of joy you are shedding,

0:16:54.540,0:16:59.800
because at the end of the da,y God has blessed your daughter abundantly.

0:16:59.800,0:17:01.040
Yes.

0:17:01.040,0:17:04.180
I am Christy Kiaham from Abuja.

0:17:04.180,0:17:09.420
This is my mummy, my younger sister. I’m the second born of my mummy.

0:17:09.420,0:17:15.300
My mummy has been the one taking care of us.

0:17:15.320,0:17:18.620
The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua

0:17:18.620,0:17:22.580
When I am at home, I do assist her, we go to the village market

0:17:22.580,0:17:27.740
to sell ice-cream to assist her for my brothers' and sisters' school fees.

0:17:27.740,0:17:34.740
During the mass prayer, my prayer point was: ‘God, locate Evelyn.’

0:17:34.740,0:17:38.540
Behold – after few seconds, the man of God located her.

0:17:38.540,0:17:43.620
I was rejoicing because I believed that all the problems we were facing had been solved.

0:17:43.620,0:17:47.960
To my greatest surprise, the man of God called her and said: "I want to be your friend",

0:17:47.960,0:17:51.680
I was crying. It was a thing of joy.

0:17:51.680,0:17:58.500
I didn’t expect this. Among thousands for the man of God to locate somebody like this

0:17:58.500,0:18:00.420
- it was a great joy.

0:18:00.420,0:18:03.900
I thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:18:03.900,0:18:10.320
May God bless him and his family and the Emmanuel TV team.

0:18:10.320,0:18:21.320
She was given with her friend a brand new car, N500 000, six bags of rice and a Bible.

0:18:21.320,0:18:23.720
My heart was full of joy.

0:18:23.720,0:18:30.580
God, I thank You for using the man of God to locate my sister, to bless my sister.

0:18:30.580,0:18:34.760
God, I give You all the glory, honour, I adore You.

0:18:34.760,0:18:36.080
There is no one like You.

0:18:36.080,0:18:41.340
Despite her stature, the man of God received her as his daughter.

0:18:41.340,0:18:47.300
I want to advise people all over the world, don’t lose hope.

0:18:47.300,0:18:51.400
No matter your stature – believe in God.

0:18:51.400,0:18:52.360
Pray.

0:18:52.360,0:18:57.040
As God located my sister, He will surely locate you.

0:18:57.040,0:18:58.100
Amen.

0:18:58.100,0:19:01.660
My name is Okweki Lucky. I’m from Edo State.

0:19:01.660,0:19:06.460
I married the immediate senior sister to Christy here.

0:19:06.460,0:19:13.260
Four years ago, Christy brought this girl to our house, and introduced her to be her friend.

0:19:13.260,0:19:19.060
Instead of rejecting her, we accepted her to our family,

0:19:19.060,0:19:24.020
and ever since, she has been a source of joy to our family.

0:19:24.020,0:19:27.680
Last Sunday I was watching Emmanuel TV.

0:19:27.680,0:19:32.880
I was so surprised to see the man of God calling this girl out.

0:19:32.880,0:19:37.880
Later I saw that the man of God presented a gift of N500 000 to them,

0:19:37.880,0:19:41.000
a brand new car and six bags of rice.

0:19:41.000,0:19:43.800
We were rejoicing over there in Edo State.

0:19:43.800,0:19:47.840
That is why we came to rejoice with them.

0:19:47.840,0:19:51.200
Yes, we thank God Almighty for everything.

0:19:51.200,0:19:55.620
We also thank you so much for taking time out of your tight schedule to come here

0:19:55.620,0:20:01.820
to show appreciation to God Almighty, for what God has used the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:20:01.820,0:20:06.380
to do in the life of your sister-in-law, and your sister-in-law's friend,

0:20:06.380,0:20:09.100
and of course your sister-in-law's friend family.

0:20:09.100,0:20:12.480
We also want to let you know that of course, it is the work of God,

0:20:12.480,0:20:15.620
and God does as He wills and of course, God's time is the best.

0:20:15.620,0:20:20.100
The moment God Almighty locates you, even in your trouble, your trouble will turn to solution.

0:20:20.100,0:20:22.940
That happened in the life of our two friends here.

0:20:22.940,0:20:27.580
We also believe that God will extend it to lives of others.

0:20:27.580,0:20:30.840
We want to encourage our friends here to continue their relationship,

0:20:30.840,0:20:33.300
which has been founded upon the Rock of Ages.

0:20:33.300,0:20:37.940
This kind of friendship is a type of friendship that Jesus Christ is looking for to bless them,

0:20:37.940,0:20:40.320
to cement the relationship the more.

0:20:40.320,0:20:44.720
We pray that the joy of the Lord that has actually commenced in this family

0:20:44.720,0:20:47.500
will continue to reign, in Jesus' name.

0:20:47.500,0:20:53.200
Can we just hear a wonderful song from someone after this really wonderful testimony?
