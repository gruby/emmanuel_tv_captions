0:00:01.780,0:00:06.800
You have a very strange urge. It's an attack.

0:00:06.820,0:00:08.400
It's true, Man of God.

0:00:08.400,0:00:10.660
And you are a beautiful woman.

0:00:10.660,0:00:14.180
There is an attack - urge.

0:00:14.180,0:00:15.840
You cannot be satisfied.

0:00:15.840,0:00:18.060
It's true, Man of God.

0:00:18.060,0:00:21.040
And that has caused sore in your private parts.

0:00:21.040,0:00:23.560
All the time you disturb your private parts.

0:00:23.560,0:00:26.140
It's true, Man of God.

0:00:26.140,0:00:33.540
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:33.540,0:00:38.480
In the name of Jesus Christ, I demand for release!

0:00:38.480,0:00:41.440
Be released, in the name of Jesus! Thank You.

0:00:41.440,0:00:54.120
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:00:54.120,0:00:58.420
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:00:58.420,0:01:03.880
My name is Hannah Mgemezulu. I'm 22 years old and I'm from Malawi.

0:01:03.880,0:01:07.560
This is my mother and the other one is my sister.

0:01:07.560,0:01:13.660
Last week, the man of God gave me a prophecy and that prophecy is true.

0:01:13.660,0:01:23.160
When I was 13 years old, I used to feel that this part of my body was heavy

0:01:23.160,0:01:28.280
and I had a strange urge which began at that age.

0:01:28.280,0:01:33.420
Because my father was a pastor, I used to tell him to pray for me

0:01:33.420,0:01:36.240
as I had no feeling on one side of my body.

0:01:36.240,0:01:39.920
He would pray for me and tell me that I was delivered.

0:01:39.920,0:01:43.400
The next day, I would ask him, "Dad, pray for me;

0:01:43.400,0:01:47.080
the same feeling I was having yesterday is still there".

0:01:47.080,0:01:49.160
He would pray for me and say, "You are delivered!"

0:01:49.160,0:01:54.800
Then, I just gave up as I could not be telling him every day to pray for me.

0:01:54.800,0:02:02.280
After that, I went to a boarding school where I was exposed to the world.

0:02:02.280,0:02:08.740
My friends introduced me to drinking, which I started to do.

0:02:08.740,0:02:16.700
From the first day I started drinking, I liked alcohol very much and I never stopped drinking.

0:02:16.700,0:02:19.380
And what age were you when you started drinking alcohol?

0:02:19.380,0:02:23.000
I started drinking at the age of 15.

0:02:23.000,0:02:30.980
Then I continued drinking, going out with my friends until in that secondary school, I was expelled.

0:02:30.980,0:02:37.300
They removed me from the school.

0:02:37.300,0:02:43.780
We would drink, hold parties and started destroying the school.

0:02:43.780,0:02:49.700
After that, my mum took me to a school because my father was angry at me

0:02:49.700,0:02:52.140
and refused to pay my school fees.

0:02:52.140,0:02:58.220
My mum then took me to this day secondary school where she was paying my school fees.

0:02:58.260,0:03:07.820
For the whole term, I can say I attended school for one week.

0:03:07.820,0:03:14.080
I would go to school but then go off with my friends, straight to the town

0:03:14.080,0:03:19.520
to buy alcohol and drink. Then, I would go back to school and start making noise

0:03:19.520,0:03:24.160
and would be expelled again.

0:03:24.160,0:03:40.000
I wrote exams; then I went to university where I was exposed to a newer kind of freedom.

0:03:40.000,0:03:47.280
As I was far away from home, I had freedom - my mum and dad were not there.

0:03:47.280,0:03:52.360
I started drinking excessively; every day I would get drunk.

0:03:52.360,0:03:56.340
After class or maybe on the way to class, I would be drinking.

0:03:56.340,0:04:03.080
After three weeks, I met this boy who was smoking Indian Hemp.

0:04:03.080,0:04:09.620
I asked him what he was smoking. He told me that it was weed, that it could make me high.

0:04:09.620,0:04:22.620
I told him that I wanted to get high and then he introduced me to weed.

0:04:22.620,0:04:28.100
I loved the weed so much - more than alcohol.

0:04:28.100,0:04:38.440
I would smoke it and in class, they would call me 'Banana' - that was my name now.

0:04:38.440,0:04:41.680
Beautiful and high nana because I was always high.

0:04:41.680,0:04:49.800
If you saw my eyes then, you could not see the white area as it looked not even red but black.

0:04:49.800,0:04:52.600
Brown - I don't know what I can call it.

0:04:52.600,0:05:00.840
I would drink in the morning and evening; everywhere I went, I would drink.

0:05:00.840,0:05:11.480
My father died and I was alone. I used to cry about his death but then I would forget about it.

0:05:11.480,0:05:17.580
My mum believed that her giving me money, led to my drinking

0:05:17.580,0:05:21.100
and so she reduced the amount of money she would send me.

0:05:21.100,0:05:26.840
She would just send me enough money for food or pocket money;

0:05:26.840,0:05:32.200
I could count it, and it wasn't enough to support my drinking habit.

0:05:32.200,0:05:36.140
I told my mum when I was on holiday,

0:05:36.140,0:05:42.360
"Mum, are you serious? You have stopped giving me money! Your daughter!"

0:05:42.360,0:05:48.720
She said, "Yes, I have stopped". I told her, "I will find money in my own way!"

0:05:48.720,0:05:51.440
I then challenged my mum, "I will follow men!"

0:05:51.440,0:05:53.480
I then started following men.

0:05:53.480,0:06:00.020
I would tell the men I followed that I loved them, whereas I loved their money

0:06:00.020,0:06:03.680
because I wanted them to buy me alcohol; I wanted to drink every day.

0:06:03.680,0:06:09.780
I would just come out from my house, start walking, without knowing where I was going

0:06:09.780,0:06:12.000
I would just find myself in the bar.

0:06:12.000,0:06:19.180
I would drink and people would just buy me alcoholic drinks.

0:06:19.180,0:06:24.720
This led to me following men.

0:06:24.720,0:06:28.600
My boyfriend left me and he told me, "Ah, you are a prostitute!

0:06:28.600,0:06:36.400
"How can I be with a girl who follows men just because of alcohol!" Then he dumped me.

0:06:36.400,0:06:46.780
Because people knew that I loved alcohol, two girls in the fourth year invited me to their room

0:06:46.780,0:06:51.620
to drink. They bought me wine and a bottle of vodka.

0:06:51.620,0:07:00.220
We started drinking. After I got drunk, they both slept with me.

0:07:00.220,0:07:09.620
After that, the spirit of man entered me and whenever a woman would pass me,

0:07:09.620,0:07:14.820
I would want to look at her behind.

0:07:14.820,0:07:24.300
Because I was shy and could not approach the women, it led me to masturbation;

0:07:24.300,0:07:30.180
I would just look at the women and then masturbate. It also led me to pornography.

0:07:30.180,0:07:41.480
Also, when I was in the third year, at a party drinking,

0:07:41.480,0:07:50.360
two boys raped me which led me to start hating men.

0:07:50.360,0:07:52.320
I did not like men anymore.

0:07:52.320,0:08:02.540
That led to frequent masturbation. I would masturbate five times a day, just to satisfy myself.

0:08:02.540,0:08:09.920
But I was still not satisfied. The drinking, smoking and masturbation did not satisfy me.

0:08:09.920,0:08:18.320
When I was dissatisfied, I would drink more than any man -

0:08:18.320,0:08:24.100
they could not challenge me when it came to drinking alochol.

0:08:24.100,0:08:31.340
I would drink and smoke maybe 15 blunts a day.

0:08:31.340,0:08:36.300
Because of my drinking and smoking, I wasn't going to school.

0:08:36.300,0:08:41.520
I was suspended for the first time and then went back to school.

0:08:41.520,0:08:49.720
I continued with the same behaviour - challenging my teachers, saying funny things in class,

0:08:49.720,0:08:53.680
before being suspended for the second time.

0:08:53.680,0:08:59.860
One day, I was sitting and looking at my mum as she was crying and complaining about me.

0:08:59.860,0:09:09.140
My neighbours would be saying all sorts of bad things about me. I told her she had her God.

0:09:09.140,0:09:16.560
She had taken me to a lot of different places but no solution. I would even challenge pastors,

0:09:16.560,0:09:18.900
telling them that they could not deliver me.

0:09:18.900,0:09:24.620
I would tell them, "You deliver me today, I'll drink again tomorrow; I'm even high now".

0:09:24.620,0:09:29.240
Just after they would pray for me, I would go out, smoke and come back to tell them,

0:09:29.240,0:09:31.960
"I have smoked the weed. Have you prayed for me?"

0:09:31.960,0:09:44.960
My mum would complain. Emmanuel TV would always be on in our house and we would watch it.

0:09:44.960,0:09:50.660
I believed that the man of God, T.B. Joshua, was the only one who had the power

0:09:50.660,0:09:52.780
to deliver me from the evil spirit within me.

0:09:52.780,0:09:55.980
So, I told my mum not to waste her money on school fees

0:09:55.980,0:10:01.440
as I knew that if she sent me to school, I would be suspended again.

0:10:01.440,0:10:07.260
I told her to take me to the man of God, and then that's when she brought me here.

0:10:07.260,0:10:10.760
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:10.760,0:10:14.980
So you mean, even to the point where you came here, you were still smoking,

0:10:14.980,0:10:20.180
still drinking, still engaging in all of these things just before you arrived here in the church.

0:10:20.180,0:10:30.680
Yes, the week before I came here, I was drinking more than I used to.

0:10:30.680,0:10:37.680
I told my mum, "Let me drink for the last time because I know that this man of God,

0:10:37.680,0:10:41.920
T.B. Joshua, will deliver me". I had never fallen down before.

0:10:41.920,0:10:47.300
Before, I had never fallen down upon receiving prayer, I would just laugh at them.

0:10:47.300,0:10:54.580
I said, "Mum, I know that this pastor will deliver me. This will be my last time drinking".

0:10:54.580,0:10:59.620
I was drinking until the day that I came here.

0:10:59.620,0:11:04.520
Wow,  we thank God that God brought you here to The SCOAN.

0:11:04.520,0:11:08.560
You said, in your experience, when you were being prayed for,

0:11:08.560,0:11:13.020
you never had an experience of falling down or receiving a touch from the anointing of Jesus Christ.

0:11:13.020,0:11:16.560
Can you describe to us: When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you,

0:11:16.560,0:11:19.540
what happened to you? Just describe that experience.

0:11:19.540,0:11:27.140
At first he was moving and touching everyone. When he touched me, I felt something

0:11:27.140,0:11:32.220
and became so angry; I wanted to scream but I don't know what happened.

0:11:32.220,0:11:37.440
After that, he came and and gave me a word of prophecy.

0:11:37.440,0:11:47.320
I don't know how to explain how I felt. I felt this power in me and on this part of my body,

0:11:47.320,0:11:54.640
something just left me and my heart became so free.

0:11:54.640,0:12:05.560
I had never been sober since I was 15 years old but after my deliverance, I am high on something

0:12:05.560,0:12:09.880
I had been searching for - I am fully satisfied!

0:12:09.880,0:12:11.380
That's how I feel.

0:12:11.380,0:12:14.740
Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:14.740,0:12:19.060
That is an encounter with the power of God. Sister, it has been one week now.

0:12:19.060,0:12:23.100
Just testify - how is your life now after the deliverance and the prophecy?

0:12:23.100,0:12:25.920
What are the changes you've experienced in your life?

0:12:25.920,0:12:31.680
I'm so free in my heart. Previously, I had the spirit of anger.

0:12:31.680,0:12:34.100
I used to be very angry.

0:12:34.100,0:12:41.440
I would tell my mum that my head was hurting but I would be angry for nothing.

0:12:41.440,0:12:52.180
Now, I am so free. I feel light and I can talk to my mum and sister freely. My heart is free.

0:12:52.180,0:12:56.000
I don't have bad dreams.

0:12:56.000,0:13:01.000
I know there are  beautiful women here, but I don't have the desire to look at them.

0:13:01.000,0:13:05.560
I don't know what happened. It's just not in me anymore.

0:13:05.560,0:13:09.900
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:13:09.900,0:13:13.940
We saw in the prophecy that the man of God said that you would even attempt to satisfy yourself

0:13:13.940,0:13:16.880
throughmasturbation, to the point that you would even injure yourself.

0:13:16.880,0:13:22.860
But since that prophecy and deliverance, every urge for those things has disappeared, is that right?

0:13:22.860,0:13:26.440
Yes, completely. I don't have the urge to masturbate anymore.

0:13:26.440,0:13:28.580
I've been sleeping properly.

0:13:28.580,0:13:37.440
I sleep the whole night, and that urge is no longer in me - I don't masturbate anymore.

0:13:37.440,0:13:41.540
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:13:41.540,0:13:44.640
So, sister, we believe you'll be in a position to give a word of advice,

0:13:44.640,0:13:48.300
especially to young people out there who may be living the kind of lifestyle

0:13:48.300,0:13:52.960
you were once living, involved in the spirit of lust, addiction to various things

0:13:52.960,0:13:57.240
such as alcohol and drugs. You are a living witness to the power of God

0:13:57.240,0:13:59.420
and the changes that He can bring in your life.

0:13:59.420,0:14:01.460
What is your advice to such people?

0:14:01.460,0:14:09.420
My advice to young people who are going through my situation is that,

0:14:09.420,0:14:15.560
the only 'highness' you can get on earth that will satisfy you is from God.

0:14:15.560,0:14:23.200
Weed, alcohol, cocaine or whatever, will not get you anywhere; just run to God.

0:14:23.200,0:14:27.260
It is only the Holy Spirit that can give you the 'high'.

0:14:27.260,0:14:31.820
As you can see me now, I am sober and I feel happy.

0:14:31.820,0:14:36.400
Those things will not make you happy; they will just disturb you mentally.

0:14:36.400,0:14:40.320
For you parents, never give up on your children.

0:14:40.320,0:14:45.360
If my mother had given up on me, I would have become something else

0:14:45.360,0:14:49.180
but she never gave up on me; don't disown your children.

0:14:49.180,0:14:56.220
Bring them close to God because God is the only one who can help you.

0:14:56.220,0:14:59.800
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:14:59.800,0:15:04.840
We give all the glory to God Almighty. So at this point, let's just hear a brief word from her mother.

0:15:04.840,0:15:07.340
And we thank God for what He has done in the life of this family.

0:15:07.340,0:15:11.900
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:15:11.900,0:15:16.540
My name is Mrs Maria Mgemezulu from Malawi.

0:15:16.540,0:15:25.680
This one is my daughter Hannah. This one is Vinjeru - it means wisdom.

0:15:25.680,0:15:32.320
I'm short of words. I'm the happiest woman in the world.

0:15:32.320,0:15:36.340
I've suffered because of this girl.

0:15:36.340,0:15:40.520
It was a challenge - a big challenge.

0:15:40.520,0:15:44.620
I could not sleep. I could not eat.

0:15:44.620,0:15:54.840
I was always praying to my God and listening to the teachings of the man of God.

0:15:54.840,0:16:05.740
One day, I was angry - very angry. I whipped her. I wanted to kill her.

0:16:05.740,0:16:10.580
After that, I started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:16:10.580,0:16:16.500
Then the man of God was teaching that you cannot force your children

0:16:16.500,0:16:23.480
to go to church or to do good things but you should always pray for them.

0:16:23.480,0:16:26.840
I believed in that teaching.

0:16:26.840,0:16:30.960
I started praying day and night.

0:16:30.960,0:16:37.760
She would come and knock, "Stop, you woman; stop praying!"

0:16:37.760,0:16:41.120
What are you praying?  Can't you see? Now I'm smoking.

0:16:41.120,0:16:47.880
When you pray, this is when I smoke more. When you pray, this is when I drink more. Can you stop?"

0:16:47.880,0:16:55.260
I told her, "I'll not stop praying until you get delivered!"

0:16:55.260,0:17:03.800
And indeed today, she is delivered.

0:17:03.800,0:17:08.280
Hallelujah! What are the changes you've seen in your daughter's life since that deliverance?

0:17:08.280,0:17:10.780
Oh, she´s a good girl!

0:17:10.780,0:17:18.020
She can pray. She can read the Bible. We can chat. We can communicate in the morning.

0:17:18.020,0:17:26.220
After praying in our room, she'll come to the altar, pray and read the Bible.

0:17:26.220,0:17:33.180
She's discussing a lot about a her future. I'm very, very happy. Praise God

0:17:33.180,0:17:36.900
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:17:36.900,0:17:39.420
Indeed, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

0:17:39.420,0:17:44.700
Finally, Madam, what is your word of advice to parents, especially out there watching?

0:17:44.700,0:17:52.820
My advice is to all parents, especially women.

0:17:52.820,0:17:58.260
Please continue praying for your daughters. Don't give up. Don't shout at them.

0:17:58.260,0:18:01.880
Pray every day and night.

0:18:01.880,0:18:06.220
Keep on checking in their rooms.

0:18:06.220,0:18:09.480
I didn´t know that she was smoking and drinking.

0:18:09.480,0:18:19.920
But one day, I was cleaning their rooms. That is when I discovered Indian hemp

0:18:19.920,0:18:25.420
and bottles of beer - sachets of different types of beer.

0:18:25.420,0:18:35.280
If you went to her room today, you would find a lot of bottles and cigarettes of Indian hemp.

0:18:35.280,0:18:41.540
So, keep on checking their rooms, keep on praying for them day and night

0:18:41.540,0:18:45.680
and listen to the man of God's teachings.

0:18:45.680,0:18:46.600
Amen.

0:18:46.600,0:18:52.100
Lastly, I would like to thank the man of God for keeping us for almost two weeks,

0:18:52.100,0:18:55.280
thank Emmanuel TV and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:18:55.280,0:18:57.000
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:18:57.000,0:19:00.900
Amen. Let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:19:00.900,0:19:05.800
Thank You, Jesus, indeed. So let's just finally here a quick word from the other sister

0:19:05.800,0:19:07.940
to cap off this wonderful testimony.

0:19:07.940,0:19:09.940
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:19:09.940,0:19:12.160
My name is Vinjeru Mgemezulu.

0:19:12.160,0:19:17.120
The person standing next to me is my sister. The other person is my mum.

0:19:17.120,0:19:21.700
I knew that my sister used to drink because we used to sleep in the same room.

0:19:21.700,0:19:25.780
I was allergic to smells.

0:19:25.780,0:19:29.020
She would come and sleep on my bed. She would be smelling of alcohol

0:19:29.020,0:19:32.900
but I never told my mum until she found out by herself.

0:19:32.900,0:19:36.500
The time she went to university, she started drinking and smoking.

0:19:36.500,0:19:40.400
I knew everything but I could not tell my mum because the moment I had told her,

0:19:40.400,0:19:45.320
my mum would have asked her and she would get angry. Sometimes, she would beat me up.

0:19:45.320,0:19:48.740
Then sometimes, when I was mopping, she would pass.

0:19:48.740,0:19:54.100
Then when I asked her why she was passing, she would start shouting at me

0:19:54.100,0:19:57.860
and tell a lot of stories and lies.

0:19:57.860,0:20:01.240
Sometimes, she would get angry and leave the house.

0:20:01.240,0:20:05.080
She would leave the house in the morning and come back the next day in the morning,

0:20:05.080,0:20:07.080
Take a bath and go back.

0:20:07.080,0:20:11.010
Wow, so we can understand the severity of this addiction in the life of your sister.

0:20:11.010,0:20:15.820
But ever since her deliverance, what can you testify about the changes in her life?

0:20:15.820,0:20:20.280
Now we can talk. Before, when you told her a story, she would drink,

0:20:20.280,0:20:25.200
come back and tell everyone this whole story. The story was supposed to be a secret

0:20:25.200,0:20:29.200
but she would tell it -  the whole neighbourhood who actually know the story.

0:20:29.200,0:20:33.080
People in the surroundings would know the whole secret.

0:20:33.080,0:20:37.440
She never used to drink juice - she hated juice.

0:20:37.440,0:20:41.400
She hated eating, But now, she can eat, she can drink juice.

0:20:41.400,0:20:44.400
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:44.400,0:20:47.900
We give all the glory to God Almighty. We thank God for what He has done in the life of this family.

0:20:47.900,0:20:51.000
We just have one final question for our sister.

0:20:51.000,0:20:54.400
Sister, in the midst of this, could you tell us: When you were smoking and drinking,

0:20:54.400,0:20:59.980
what began happening to your health as a result of these addictions?

0:20:59.980,0:21:02.960
My health was affected..

0:21:02.960,0:21:07.540
If I didn't smoke, I wouldn´t eat. If I didn't smoke for three days,

0:21:07.540,0:21:09.740
I wouldn't eat for three days.

0:21:09.740,0:21:13.740
It caused seizures; I had epilepsy.

0:21:13.740,0:21:19.520
When I drank, I would fall. It was affecting me.

0:21:19.520,0:21:26.380
I would forget everything - I had loss of memory.

0:21:26.380,0:21:31.340
But ever since the deliverance all of those experiences, the seizures, the loss of memory -

0:21:31.340,0:21:32.980
everything has come to an end?

0:21:32.980,0:21:36.680
Yes, I can even eat more than my mother.

0:21:36.680,0:21:41.320
Thank You, Jesus. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:21:41.320,0:21:48.120
Mum, I'm sorry. You should forgive me. And i love you.

0:21:48.120,0:21:52.540
Like the man of God says, we should not keep offence.

0:21:52.540,0:22:00.040
Thank You, Jesus! Let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
