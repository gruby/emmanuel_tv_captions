WARNING! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature

0:00:04.900,0:00:09.760
and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.

0:00:09.760,0:00:15.380
A shocking condition brought this man to The SCOAN.

0:00:15.380,0:00:19.400
His body riddled with a lot of sickness.

0:00:19.400,0:00:25.240
Right from the crown of his head, his entire body has been engulfed in a plague,

0:00:25.240,0:00:29.740
shattering his skin into scale-like fragments.

0:00:29.740,0:00:37.960
There is not a hair left on his head as the frightening sickness has completely destroyed the skin.

0:00:37.960,0:00:44.040
From his head, the disease rages across his body, damaging every inch

0:00:44.040,0:00:46.760
and rendering his arms useless.

0:00:46.760,0:00:55.160
The skin flakes and peels horribly all the way down his arms to his fingers.

0:00:55.160,0:01:00.180
Not an inch of his skin has been left unaffected.

0:01:00.180,0:01:05.940
This is a body that cannot lie down, bend or work.

0:01:05.940,0:01:13.320
A once strong and healthy man - now not even a shadow of his former self

0:01:13.320,0:01:21.080
as this debilitating disease has even made menial tasks an unimaginable thought.

0:01:21.080,0:01:28.300
Right down his legs to his feet, the storm of destruction continued with no intermission.

0:01:28.300,0:01:35.940
Much of the skin has been scratched - here exposing the sensitive flesh.

0:01:35.940,0:01:43.440
Some of the broken pieces of his skin can still be seen barely hanging off his hurting body.

0:01:43.440,0:01:51.900
His legs are at places as rough as a tree bark; it is uncomfortable and just as disfigured.

0:01:51.900,0:02:06.240
Even the small movements he makes to turn must be causing him terrible discomfort.

0:02:06.240,0:02:14.260
Demonstrating his fragile state, he touches a piece of his splintered skin which comes off at his hand.

0:02:14.260,0:02:25.260
And you can clearly see that more is ready to fall.

0:02:25.260,0:02:29.800
Let's listen to him.

0:02:29.800,0:02:33.560
My name is Jude Oraka. I come from Anambra State (Nigeria).

0:02:33.560,0:02:36.380
I am 39 years old.

0:02:36.380,0:02:40.560
Can you please tell us the problem that brought you to The SCOAN today?

0:02:40.560,0:02:45.060
I have had skin disease for 6 years.

0:02:45.060,0:02:48.740
I cannot sleep; my body itches.

0:02:48.740,0:02:54.000
I cannot walk fine; I feel cold.

0:02:54.000,0:02:56.320
I have general body pain.

0:02:56.320,0:03:01.560
My body used to peel; my skin falls off.

0:03:01.560,0:03:06.020
I have gone to hospitals but the doctors don't have any solution.

0:03:06.020,0:03:09.180
I have gone to native doctors.

0:03:09.180,0:03:12.540
I have taken native medicine but there is no solution.

0:03:12.540,0:03:14.020
I am a driver.

0:03:14.020,0:03:16.460
Since that time, I can't drive; I stay at home.

0:03:16.460,0:03:20.660
So how did you hear about The SCOAN?

0:03:20.660,0:03:22.900
I watch Emmanuel TV.

0:03:22.900,0:03:25.340
I believe that God will heal me.

0:03:25.340,0:03:28.540
We pray with you that God Almighty will set you free

0:03:28.540,0:03:32.340
from this problem of terrible skin disease in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:03:32.340,0:03:33.240
Amen.

0:03:33.240,0:03:41.280
HEALING TIME

0:03:41.280,0:03:44.480
Watch your screen. That will help your faith.

0:03:44.480,0:03:46.620
Look at the case here.

0:03:46.620,0:03:48.480
It is a mysterious issue.

0:03:48.480,0:03:51.480
I never knew how he came here

0:03:51.480,0:03:55.540
because I don't know the kind of vehicle that would convey this man here.

0:03:55.540,0:03:59.100
So let him get free and go.

0:03:59.100,0:04:02.600
Man of God, please help my brother; he has skin disease for the past six years.

0:04:02.600,0:04:05.120
We have taken him all over; there is no solution.

0:04:05.120,0:04:08.980
Neither herbalist homes or hospitals have provided any solution.

0:04:08.980,0:04:12.780
Man of God, please help my brother. He has skin disease.

0:04:12.780,0:04:15.320
- For how many years? 
- For six years, sir.

0:04:15.320,0:04:18.140
Ok, let's hear from your brother. What is your problem?

0:04:18.140,0:04:19.800
Can you talk?

0:04:19.800,0:04:21.960
It is skin disease

0:04:21.960,0:04:25.800
Ok, it seems that he cannot talk.

0:04:25.800,0:04:31.320
As you see his appearance, so it is on the inside.

0:04:31.320,0:04:36.900
Both within and inside is like this.

0:04:36.900,0:04:40.320
You will be able to say a word with me?

0:04:40.320,0:04:44.700
Are you ready to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour?

0:04:44.700,0:04:45.840
Yes.

0:04:45.840,0:04:47.280
Thank you.

0:04:47.280,0:04:48.940
Come on.

0:04:48.940,0:04:56.880
I command that disease, that infirmity in your body, in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:04:56.880,0:05:06.240
I command that infirmity out! Begin to vomit it out!

0:05:06.240,0:05:19.080
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit

0:05:19.080,0:05:21.080
Out!

0:05:21.080,0:05:40.400
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit

0:05:40.400,0:05:45.880
I say, you disease, you can hear me. Come out of this man's life!

0:05:45.880,0:05:53.540
In the name of Jesus, come out!

0:05:53.540,0:06:00.800
You can see what the name of Jesus can do.

0:06:00.800,0:06:04.860
I say, out!

0:06:04.860,0:06:08.060
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:06:08.060,0:06:14.520
I say out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:14.520,0:06:22.620
It must come out because the name of Jesus is given to cast out demons

0:06:22.620,0:06:24.880
and to speak to disease.

0:06:24.880,0:06:33.680
With the name, we have dominion over all disease, affliction

0:06:33.680,0:06:41.100
infirmity, trouble and the challenges in your life.

0:06:41.100,0:06:46.340
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:06:46.340,0:06:51.440
It is poison; he drank poison.

0:06:51.440,0:06:54.780
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:06:54.780,0:06:58.300
Can you see what I asked you to be patient for?

0:06:58.300,0:07:06.740
An issue like this cannot be handled in the same way I handle your case.

0:07:06.740,0:07:26.000
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:07:26.000,0:07:27.740
Look here!

0:07:27.740,0:07:29.880
In the name of Jesus, stand up.

0:07:29.880,0:07:33.260
Instantly, the man rises to his feet.

0:07:33.260,0:07:35.260
He's free.

0:11:36.560,0:11:38.300
I don't feel any pain.

0:11:38.300,0:11:41.500

the power and effectiveness are still the same - yesterday, today and forever.

0:12:39.160,0:12:41.500
Our brother is a living testimony.

0:12:41.500,0:12:46.000
Let us put our hands together beautifully for the King of Glory!

Please, let us have our seats.

Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:12:57.620,0:13:00.520
Brethren, Good Morning!

0:13:00.520,0:13:03.360
My name is Monica Odey.

0:13:03.360,0:13:07.800
The man beside me is my brother, Jude Oraka.

0:13:07.800,0:13:13.640
We come from Anambra State (Nigeria).

0:13:13.640,0:13:19.960
It all started... He was sick for over six years.

0:13:19.960,0:13:26.780
About two years ago, the sickness developed into chronic skin disease.

0:13:26.780,0:13:32.960
The disease started gradually but spread from the back to the stomach

0:13:32.960,0:13:40.660
to the legs until it affected his entire body, including his head, eyes and ears.

0:13:40.660,0:13:47.260
The problem kept getting worse. We took him to hospitals and herbal homes.

0:13:47.260,0:13:52.860
We took him everywhere! In short, it became a curse.

0:13:52.860,0:13:56.880
If he was coming on the way, people would leave the road.

0:13:56.880,0:14:01.460
We didn't have to ask for an excuse; we were already carrying one by our side.

0:14:01.460,0:14:04.620
Anywhere they saw us coming, people would start running.

0:14:04.620,0:14:07.700
They would ask if it was a ghost or a human being.

0:14:07.700,0:14:12.600
I want to thank God today - I didn't know that Jesus was still alive to bring

0:14:12.600,0:14:15.780
my brother who was dead back to life today.

0:14:15.780,0:14:21.500
We are here to celebrate life and return the glory back to God.

0:14:21.500,0:14:34.720
Last year, it was on July 5th that we came here.

0:14:34.720,0:14:38.060
When we got to the village, his condition became so terrible.

0:14:38.060,0:14:42.620
All of us gathered but nobody could proffer a solution.

0:14:42.620,0:14:50.060
They said the problem was beyond human imagination and understanding.

0:14:50.060,0:14:58.140
The family discussed what to do about it.

0:14:58.140,0:15:05.820
Nobody could offer a solution. At that time, I had just given birth.

0:15:05.820,0:15:16.180
I told them that there is only one man that can do this job - Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:15:16.180,0:15:19.200
Okay. Point of correction.

0:15:19.200,0:15:25.840
Only God Almighty can do it through His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:15:25.840,0:15:29.680
Remember that the man of God says, I am not the Healer but I know the Healer.

0:15:29.680,0:15:32.280
His name is Jesus Christ". All glory be to God!

0:15:32.280,0:15:37.860
Let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:15:37.860,0:15:48.760
We realised that there was nothing else to do as we had almost given up hope.

0:15:48.760,0:15:51.740
We knew he was a walking corpse, a dead man already

0:15:51.740,0:15:58.100
and any money invested on him was wasted as he had no hope of living.

0:15:58.100,0:16:05.800
I insisted they allow me to travel to Lagos with him to seek the God of T.B. Joshua.

0:16:05.800,0:16:14.460
They then asked me how he could travel from Anambra to Lagos.

0:16:14.460,0:16:18.960
They said he may likely die on the road but I said that if that happened,

0:16:18.960,0:16:22.000
we would return the corpse back to Makurdi.

0:16:22.000,0:16:27.780
I knew if I just stayed and watched him die, I would not be able to forgive myself.

0:16:27.780,0:16:30.580
I told them to take a step of faith.

0:16:30.580,0:16:38.640
I had a small child with me and they then asked who would travel to Lagos with him.

0:16:38.640,0:16:44.880
They said they didn't know about the church activities, so I said I would go.

0:16:44.880,0:16:53.200
They asked how I would take the man and my baby, considering his skin disease.

0:16:53.200,0:16:59.620
You could not hold him with your bare hands; you had to use a rag to hold him

0:16:59.620,0:17:05.060
because his skin was peeling off.

0:17:05.060,0:17:10.640
I asked my husband if he would allow me to travel with the child and he agreed.

0:17:10.640,0:17:16.960
I said I would go but they said I could not take such a journey alone.

0:17:16.960,0:17:26.660
His wife volunteered to go but said she would not be seen with him in public.

0:17:26.660,0:17:30.360
I said she should not worry as I was ready to bear the shame.

0:17:30.360,0:17:42.180
We took the journey. To dress him up, we put him in four shirts. From up to down.

0:17:42.180,0:17:51.020
We gave him thick socks and tied him with a headtie.

0:17:51.020,0:17:55.820
We gave him a cap and a pair of spectacles to cover his eyes.

0:17:55.820,0:18:01.320
Only the mouth was seen and with that, people were still detecting the problem.

0:18:01.320,0:18:06.400
When we got to the bus park, some people saw him and ran away.

0:18:06.400,0:18:13.740
I spoke to the driver that God wanted to use him to help us take the man

0:18:13.740,0:18:19.100
to The SCOAN in Lagos where God would show forth His mercy.

0:18:19.100,0:18:24.980
The driver agreed on the condition that we would stay at the back of the vehicle

0:18:24.980,0:18:28.840
so that the other passengers would not get distracted by his infirmity.

0:18:28.840,0:18:30.300
I said, "No problem".

0:18:30.300,0:18:35.600
We sat at the back but as the vehicle was moving, pieces of his skin were floating

0:18:35.600,0:18:38.480
inside the vehicle and it became a problem.

0:18:38.480,0:18:40.980
The other passengers became angry with the driver for carrying him,

0:18:40.980,0:18:46.260
"Must you collect money by force? Is it every passenger you see that you must carry?"

0:18:46.260,0:18:52.280
In short, we faced insults and discrace. Our bodies were smelling.

0:18:52.280,0:18:57.440
We kept faith and God brought us from Anambra to The SCOAN; we arrived.

0:18:57.440,0:19:05.920
When we were close to The SCOAN, no vehicle would take us to the church. All of them run away.

0:19:05.920,0:19:07.420
They said they could not carry such.

0:19:07.420,0:19:11.020
When the vehicle dropped us, the driver took a broom

0:19:11.020,0:19:15.920
and swept all the pieces of his skin and threw it away.

0:19:15.920,0:19:20.260
However, we couldn't find any vehicle to take us to the church in Ikotun.

0:19:20.260,0:19:24.520
They said they could not carry a dead man inside their vehicle.

0:19:24.520,0:19:32.260
All the taxis rejected us; we stood for about three hours, begging for help.

0:19:32.260,0:19:37.220
One driver eventually agreed although he charged double the fare.

0:19:37.220,0:19:39.340
I said, "No problem".

0:19:39.340,0:19:41.700
He then took us to Ikotun.

0:19:41.700,0:19:49.520
Upon reaching there, all the hoteliers ran away and denied their lodges.

0:19:49.520,0:19:52.100
Nobody agreed that they had a lodge for him to stay.

0:19:52.100,0:19:56.060
Praise God!

0:19:56.060,0:19:57.700
Amen.

0:19:57.700,0:20:01.940
Ok, for those who don't understand this part:

0:20:01.940,0:20:04.220
What the woman is trying to say is that

0:20:04.220,0:20:13.060
after all the terrible experience they had, getting to Ikotun where The SCOAN is located...

0:20:13.060,0:20:19.140
Coming down from the bus stop, one would usually have those hoteliers

0:20:19.140,0:20:23.900
running round you for accommodation, "Please come! No, I'm the first person who got this one!"

0:20:23.900,0:20:27.760
"Oya let's go!" They would drag customers.

0:20:27.760,0:20:32.820
But when they saw this man, they all ran away.

0:20:32.820,0:20:34.100
Amen.

0:20:34.100,0:20:38.040
This was not the kind of customer they were looking for.

0:20:38.040,0:20:39.600
Ok, continue.

0:20:39.600,0:20:43.700
All of them ran away and said they didn't need this type of customer.

0:20:43.700,0:20:50.540
We stood at the road for about one hour until we talked to one woman.

0:20:50.540,0:20:54.260
She said she would give us an apartment on one condition.

0:20:54.260,0:20:56.700
I asked her, "What is the condition?"

0:20:56.700,0:21:00.340
- "Double payment." 
- I said, "No problem. We will pay".

0:21:00.340,0:21:01.760
The woman ushered us to the place.

0:21:01.760,0:21:06.360
Even when we entered the lodge, people staying there started running.

0:21:06.360,0:21:13.260
We were staying in our own private room but they all ran from the compound.

0:21:13.260,0:21:19.700
We give God the glory; the day of the Saturday prayer line came.

0:21:19.700,0:21:24.720
We dressed him in a raincoat and covered all of his body

0:21:24.720,0:21:30.000
because once you saw his body, you would get scared and not come closer.

0:21:30.000,0:21:33.680
Before then, we were going from hospital to hospital.

0:21:33.680,0:21:38.800
Could you imagine a sick person in a hospital waiting to see the doctor

0:21:38.800,0:21:46.840
who saw another sick patient and ran away for fear of contacting the disease?

0:21:46.840,0:21:50.340
Whenever we entered a hospital, all the patients would allow us to go first.

0:21:50.340,0:21:56.740
The doctor would have to come out and ask who brought such a patient.

0:21:56.740,0:22:03.520
When I said I was the one, he asked how I could do such since I had a little child.

0:22:03.520,0:22:06.980
He asked if I had no conscience towards the baby I was carrying.

0:22:06.980,0:22:11.920
I said the man in question was my brother and the child was my baby.

0:22:11.920,0:22:14.680
I said that I knew nothing would happen to the child.

0:22:14.680,0:22:20.300
He told my brother to stay far away from the entrance of the hospital.

0:22:20.300,0:22:25.120
He went to sit on a block outside, not even a chair.

0:22:25.120,0:22:34.340
They had to take their medical equipment outside to attend to him.

0:22:34.340,0:22:38.180
We tried all of this to no avail.

0:22:38.180,0:22:44.440
We came back and on that fateful day, as God may have it...

0:22:44.440,0:22:51.160
If God says your time has not yet come, no matter how the devil will try,

0:22:51.160,0:22:53.440
there will still be a solution.

0:22:53.440,0:22:59.580
This young man could not eat; his whole mouth was bruised.

0:22:59.580,0:23:02.060
The body had pus all over.

0:23:02.060,0:23:11.720
If you sat near him, he would be crying day and night that his body was very hot.

0:23:11.720,0:23:18.080
I asked him how we could help him.

0:23:18.080,0:23:25.840
He said the only assistance we could give  to him was to scratch the body with a broom.

0:23:25.840,0:23:36.200
We would carry a small, strong broom and sweep the body.

0:23:36.200,0:23:42.100
When did this, he would feel a little bit of relief.

0:23:42.100,0:23:50.700
I thank God that when the man of God stretched forth his hand and prayed for him on July 5th,

0:23:50.700,0:23:57.680
from that day, he started getting healed.

0:23:57.680,0:24:02.920
Today, it has become a history and we are here to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:24:02.920,0:24:11.000
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:24:17.800,0:24:20.960
Watch your screen. That will help your faith.

0:24:20.960,0:24:24.960
Look at the case here. It is a mysterious issue.

0:24:24.960,0:24:28.080
I never knew how he came here

0:24:28.080,0:24:32.160
because I don't know the kind of vehicle that would convey this man here.

0:24:32.160,0:24:35.640
So let him get free and go.

0:24:35.640,0:24:39.100
Man of God, please help my brother; he has skin disease for the past six years.

0:24:39.100,0:24:41.620
We have taken him all over; there is no solution.

0:24:41.620,0:24:45.480
Neither herbalist homes or hospitals have provided any solution.

0:24:45.480,0:24:49.420
Man of God, please help my brother. He has skin disease.

0:24:49.420,0:24:51.860
- For how many years? 
- For six years, sir.

0:24:51.860,0:24:54.760
Ok, let's hear from your brother. What is your problem?

0:24:54.760,0:24:56.260
Can you talk?

0:24:56.260,0:24:58.560
It is skin disease

0:24:58.560,0:25:02.400
Ok, it seems that he cannot talk.

0:25:02.400,0:25:07.900
As you see his appearance, so it is on the inside.

0:25:07.900,0:25:13.500
Both within and inside is like this.

0:25:13.500,0:25:16.920
You will be able to say a word with me?

0:25:16.920,0:25:21.360
Are you ready to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour?

0:25:21.360,0:25:22.440
Yes.

0:25:22.440,0:25:23.840
Thank you.

0:25:23.840,0:25:25.660
Come on.

0:25:25.660,0:25:33.520
I command that disease, that infirmity in your body, in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:25:33.520,0:25:42.880
I command that infirmity out! Begin to vomit it out!

0:25:42.880,0:25:55.820
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit

0:25:55.820,0:25:57.600
Out!

0:25:57.600,0:26:16.960
Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit

0:26:16.960,0:26:22.480
I say, you disease, you can hear me. Come out of this man's life!

0:26:22.480,0:26:30.180
In the name of Jesus, come out!

0:26:30.180,0:26:37.300
You can see what the name of Jesus can do.

0:26:37.300,0:26:41.840
I say, out!

0:26:41.840,0:26:44.640
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:26:44.640,0:26:51.060
I say out, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:26:51.060,0:26:59.280
It must come out because the name of Jesus is given to cast out demons

0:26:59.280,0:27:01.480
and to speak to disease.

0:27:01.480,0:27:10.380
With the name, we have dominion over all disease, affliction

0:27:10.380,0:27:17.260
infirmity, trouble and the challenges in your life.

0:27:17.260,0:27:22.920
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:27:22.920,0:27:27.520
It is poison; he drank poison.

0:27:27.520,0:27:31.380
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:27:31.380,0:27:34.940
Can you see what I asked you to be patient for?

0:27:34.940,0:27:39.900
An issue like this cannot be handled in the same way I handle your case.

0:27:39.900,0:28:02.640
Vomiting Poisonous Substances

0:28:02.640,0:28:04.280
Look here!

0:28:04.280,0:28:06.520
In the name of Jesus, stand up.

0:28:06.520,0:28:09.940
Instantly, the man rises to his feet.

0:28:09.940,0:28:12.800
He's free.

0:28:12.800,0:28:17.660
As you can see, indeed, it has become a history

0:28:17.660,0:28:21.300
that he was once suffering from a chronic skin disease.

0:28:21.300,0:28:24.480
Looking at the before and after.

0:28:24.480,0:28:27.620
Wow, God has done a great thing.

0:28:27.620,0:28:36.300
Tell us, all through this period that he was passing through this terrible situation,

0:28:36.300,0:28:38.300
was there any hope?

0:28:38.300,0:28:41.300
Apart from the time you thought of bringing him here?

0:28:41.300,0:28:47.020
We had no hope at all.

0:28:47.020,0:28:49.420
Ok.

0:28:49.420,0:28:52.780
Now that the Lord, God Almighty has set him free,

0:28:52.780,0:28:58.520
you as a sister who had been bearing all the burden, how do you feel?

0:28:58.520,0:29:03.860
I feel very happy; if this is the only mission God gave me the grace to accomlish,

0:29:03.860,0:29:05.540
I am grateful to Him.

0:29:05.540,0:29:11.820
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:29:11.820,0:29:21.160
Indeed, we thank God Almighty for your patience and for being able to stand all this terrible challenge.

0:29:21.160,0:29:24.860
And we believe it wasn't you; it was the Spirit of God.

0:29:24.860,0:29:28.300
If everyone had deserted him, run away from him,

0:29:28.300,0:29:33.100
and you decided to take it upon yourself, even with a month-old baby,

0:29:33.100,0:29:35.380
I think it was the Spirit of God.

0:29:35.380,0:29:39.380
We also thank God for allowing yourself to be used by the Spirit of God

0:29:39.380,0:29:44.280
to bring him to the arena of liberty where he was eventually set free.

0:29:44.280,0:29:49.680
Once again, let us clap for Jesus Christ!

0:29:49.680,0:29:51.640
Let us hear from the man himself.

0:29:51.640,0:29:56.520
Sir, we can't see the smile on your face.

0:29:56.520,0:30:02.160
Ok. Now tell us your name.

0:30:02.160,0:30:05.320
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:30:05.320,0:30:10.240
My name is Jude Oraka. I'm from Anambra State (Nigeria).

0:30:10.240,0:30:23.880
The person beside me is my lovely sister.

0:30:23.880,0:30:32.500
I want to thank God who used my sister to bring me to The SCOAN.

0:30:32.500,0:30:36.220
The problem I had was a chronic skin disease.

0:30:36.220,0:30:42.400
Can you just explain to us - because it is said, He who feels it knows it -

0:30:42.400,0:30:45.620
what you were experiencing, what was your condition at that time?

0:30:45.620,0:30:50.480
How did you feel in your body when you were having this problem?

0:30:50.480,0:30:56.260
At that time, I felt heat all over my body.

0:30:56.260,0:31:02.900
My body was overheating like a car radiator.

0:31:02.900,0:31:07.840
I could not sit down or stand but only lie down.

0:31:07.840,0:31:12.040
For 24 hours a day, I was lying down on a bed.

0:31:12.040,0:31:15.400
I could not go to the toilet by myself.

0:31:15.400,0:31:19.460
I needed assistance in everything I did.

0:31:19.460,0:31:21.300
And who was doing that?

0:31:21.300,0:31:25.680
My lovely sister was the one helping me.

0:31:25.680,0:31:33.640
I was taken to hospitals and also to a herbalist to get native medicine

0:31:33.640,0:31:35.960
but it was all in vain.

0:31:35.960,0:31:41.340
Everywhere you went, when people saw you, how did they react?

0:31:41.340,0:31:47.520
They felt like a masquerade was coming and ran away.

0:31:47.520,0:31:51.740
Ok. When you now eventually came to The SCOAN,

0:31:51.740,0:31:54.060
the man of God stretched his hand towards you.

0:31:54.060,0:31:57.680
Can you describe to us what happened at the prayer line.

0:31:57.680,0:32:04.080
When I came and saw the man of God, he asked whether I believed in God.

0:32:04.080,0:32:07.320
I said yes.

0:32:07.320,0:32:14.880
He then prophesied that it was a poison and I was going to vomit it.

0:32:14.880,0:32:23.920
He stretched his hand towards me and I began to shake.

0:32:23.920,0:32:27.900
By that time, I was not with myself; I didn't know what was happening.

0:32:27.900,0:32:30.640
I vomitted something.

0:32:30.640,0:32:37.140
From that time, I started recovering.

0:32:37.140,0:32:38.920
And how are you now?

0:32:38.920,0:32:40.660
I'm feeling okay.

0:32:40.660,0:32:48.720
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:32:48.720,0:32:54.400
Ok, we now want you to pull up the sleeves of the cloth you are wearing.

0:32:54.400,0:32:57.820
Let us see more of your body.

0:32:57.820,0:33:06.300
Also your shoes - let us see the feet that were as rough as the bark of an oak tree then.

0:33:06.300,0:33:13.660
But today you can see that it is as smooth as the skin of a bouncing new-born baby.

0:33:13.660,0:33:14.640
Wow.

0:33:14.640,0:33:19.000
Before and After

0:33:19.000,0:33:19.960
Wow.

0:33:19.960,0:33:23.800
Before and After

0:33:23.800,0:33:30.460
For the glory of God, we want to see your feet because we know how it was when you came.

0:33:30.460,0:33:36.140
It was terrible looking. One side is okay.

0:33:36.140,0:33:37.560
Wow.

0:33:37.560,0:33:47.360
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:33:47.360,0:33:54.600
Now can you touch, tap, rub it and let us see.

0:33:54.600,0:33:58.980
Do you feel anything?

0:33:58.980,0:34:00.120
No pain.

0:34:00.120,0:34:03.060
Before, when you had this problem, this terrible skin disease,

0:34:03.060,0:34:05.560
were you able to touch or rub it?

0:34:05.560,0:34:07.400
I could not even bend down.

0:34:07.400,0:34:09.400
You couldn't even bend down?

0:34:09.400,0:34:15.080
Wow. Can you exercise your body now.

0:34:15.080,0:34:21.440
Let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:34:21.440,0:34:25.480
Thank you. Glory be to God in the highest.

0:34:25.480,0:34:28.940
Looking at what God has done in your life, setting you free,

0:34:28.940,0:34:32.900
bringing you back from death to life,

0:34:32.900,0:34:35.700
what word of advice do you have for people who are listening to you?

0:34:35.700,0:34:38.980
There are many people out there - doubting Thomases -

0:34:38.980,0:34:42.640
who don't even believe in the power of miracle but you are a living testimony.

0:34:42.640,0:34:46.480
What advice do you have for them?

0:34:46.480,0:34:51.120
What I have to say is that in any situation you face,

0:34:51.120,0:34:56.320
don't give up but put your hope in God.

0:34:56.320,0:34:58.880
Hallelujah. Thank you very much.

0:34:58.880,0:35:05.060
Indeed, no matter the circumstances, no matter the situation, do not lose hope.

0:35:05.060,0:35:07.820
Put all your faith and trust in God.

0:35:07.820,0:35:13.480
At God's own time, that problem will be over, in Jesus' name.

0:35:13.480,0:35:15.480
To God be the glory.

0:35:15.480,0:35:18.360
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:35:18.360,0:35:21.760
My advice goes like this:

0:35:21.760,0:35:28.160
Sometimes, women may have brothers passing through a difficult challenge

0:35:28.160,0:35:32.540
in such a way that it is difficult to associate with them.

0:35:32.540,0:35:37.260
But if you can summon courage, because even the day he was prayed for,

0:35:37.260,0:35:41.160
people who were watching live in Makurdi,

0:35:41.160,0:35:45.780
they were calling me to say that I was wicked.

0:35:45.780,0:35:48.280
I asked what manner of wickedness I had shown.

0:35:48.280,0:35:55.000
They asked why I took such a risk to travel with him and my child to Lagos.

0:35:55.000,0:36:00.300
They asked if the man had died on the road, what question would I answer.

0:36:00.300,0:36:04.420
I said that even if he died, I was not a murderer but looking for solution.

0:36:04.420,0:36:07.480
I knew that God would not allow him to die on the road.

0:36:07.480,0:36:15.320
But the risk you take today based on the leading of God will bring success tomorrow.

0:36:15.320,0:36:18.840
We are here today celebrating life.

0:36:18.840,0:36:20.020
Hallelujah.

0:36:20.020,0:36:23.800
Testimony Time

0:36:23.800,0:36:30.320
And standing by, watching the man of God just stretching his hand at a distance

0:36:30.320,0:36:35.680
towards your brother and he started vomiting, how did you feel?

0:36:35.680,0:36:38.020
What can you say about the power of God?

0:36:38.020,0:36:41.520
Seeing the man of God alone, even before he stretched his hand to pray,

0:36:41.520,0:36:46.980
I knew my brother would not die.

0:36:46.980,0:36:51.200
When he stretched forth his hand, I knew the end to the calamity had come.

0:36:51.200,0:36:53.060
This is a new beginning!

0:36:53.060,0:36:58.120
Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:36:58.120,0:37:01.440
Indeed, a new beginning.

0:37:01.440,0:37:04.220
Old things are gone, all things become new.

0:37:04.220,0:37:05.900
That is the promise of God.

0:37:05.900,0:37:09.280
We want to thank God Almighty for your life, sir.

0:37:09.280,0:37:13.420
For being alive today to share this wonderful testimony

0:37:13.420,0:37:20.120
because of the grace of God in the life of His able servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:37:20.120,0:37:25.660
We also just want to know, because of our viewers all over the world who want to know,

0:37:25.660,0:37:31.800
we know that miracle is only a means to an end but not the end itself.

0:37:31.800,0:37:34.300
The end is the salvation of our soul.

0:37:34.300,0:37:38.940
Can you tell us, since you received this miracle, this healing,

0:37:38.940,0:37:44.340
how has it influenced your life? Has it drawn you closer to Christ?

0:37:44.340,0:37:51.200
Are you living your life for the glory of God, now that you have received His mercy and grace?

0:37:51.200,0:37:56.340
Since I was delivered, I have surrendered my life to Christ.

0:37:56.340,0:38:02.420
I will never go back to sin again!

0:38:02.420,0:38:04.420
So the way you are talking now with ease,

0:38:04.420,0:38:08.580
were you able to talk freely like this with ease, before now?

0:38:08.580,0:38:09.300
No.

0:38:09.300,0:38:11.320
Hallelujah. No more pain?

0:38:11.320,0:38:13.920
There's no more pain. I can talk freely.

0:38:13.920,0:38:18.200
Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:38:18.200,0:38:25.400
Thank you. Indeed, this miracle is more than enough to change one's life entirely.

0:38:25.400,0:38:31.280
And now that you have recognised the power of God and have also encountered it,

0:38:31.280,0:38:34.640
we want to encourage you to remain in faith in Christ Jesus,

0:38:34.640,0:38:37.780
continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life

0:38:37.780,0:38:41.200
and your miracle will be permanent, in Jesus' name.

0:38:41.200,0:38:42.340
Amen.

0:38:42.340,0:38:44.960
So once again, sister, we want to thank you very much

0:38:44.960,0:38:48.300
for allowing yourself to be used for the glory of God

0:38:48.300,0:38:52.140
to bring this man to the arena of liberty where he was set free.

0:38:52.140,0:38:56.620
We thank God you are part of this wonderful testimony, in Jesus' name.

0:38:56.620,0:40:16.080

STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:44:37.120,0:44:43.300
We thank God today; we travelled all the way from Makurdi to come and testify.

0:44:43.300,0:44:48.380
The man of God sheltered us, gave us accommodation and took care of us.

0:44:48.380,0:44:55.120
He fed us with delicious food in the morning, afternoon and evening.

0:44:55.120,0:44:59.740
What he has done for us is wonderful and today, we are here to thank Jesus

0:44:59.740,0:45:05.080
for all God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in our family.

0:45:05.080,0:45:09.380
May the Almighty God reward him, his ministry and his family.

0:45:09.380,0:45:13.260
I wish them Heaven at last. They shall make it.

0:45:13.260,0:45:19.960
When I had this problem, I couldn't work. My sister helped me to do everything.

0:45:19.960,0:45:22.860
She lent me money because I could not work for the past six years.

0:45:22.860,0:45:29.280
She gave me money, fed me and helped me in everything that I needed.

0:45:29.280,0:45:33.340
I had no money because I couldn't work then.

0:45:33.340,0:45:35.200
But now you are back to your work?

0:45:35.200,0:45:38.240
I'm back to my work as a driver.

0:45:38.240,0:45:43.940
Prophet T.B. Joshua together with Emmanuel TV Partners decided

0:45:43.940,0:45:52.620
to give you the total sum of 200,000 naira and also transportation money of 20,000 naira.

0:45:52.620,0:45:56.840
Everything is here. The prophet said we should give you this.

0:45:56.840,0:46:03.820
Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Man of God!

0:46:03.820,0:46:12.280
I thank you very much for assisting me. I give thanks to God.

0:46:12.280,0:46:17.820
I pray God will bless him, his family and the members of Emmanuel TV.

0:46:17.820,0:46:19.340
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:46:19.340,0:46:23.860
I am here to appreciate God who used Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:46:23.860,0:46:28.340
He is one among millions; I have never seen someone like him before.

0:46:28.340,0:46:32.600
For God to use him to bless my family with the sum of N220,000,

0:46:32.600,0:46:36.460
I appreciate him and pray the good Lord would reward him, his family

0:46:36.460,0:46:38.880
and all the partners of Emmanuel TV.

0:46:38.880,0:46:44.620
His finances shall never run dry and the Lord, my God shall water him.

0:46:44.620,0:46:49.000
For the blessing given to this family, it will move from strength to strength,

0:46:49.000,0:46:54.000
never backwards. I return all the glory to God. Thank You Jesus!
