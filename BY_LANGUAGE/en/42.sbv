STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:03.580,0:00:08.020
What you are about to watch is a perfect demonstration of the same kind of miracle

0:00:08.020,0:00:11.840
that happened in the life of the man at the Beautiful Gate in Acts 3.

0:00:11.840,0:00:15.800
Watch and see for yourself and give God the glory!

0:00:15.800,0:00:17.920
The Man At The Beautiful Gate | Crippled Man Walks Instantly | TB Joshua

0:00:17.920,0:00:19.520
Oh, look!

0:00:19.520,0:00:22.080
What a pitiful sight!

0:00:22.080,0:00:26.580
And what a sad story he must have of his suffering,

0:00:26.580,0:00:29.860
due to the debilitating condition he is in!

0:00:29.860,0:00:34.500
This poor handicapped man uses his hands and feet

0:00:34.500,0:00:37.080
to drag himself along the ground,

0:00:37.080,0:00:42.100
unable to afford a wheelchair or any alternative to get around.

0:00:42.100,0:00:47.900
This man has been in this crippled state for the past ten years.

0:00:47.900,0:00:51.840
With tears of despair running down his cheeks,

0:00:51.840,0:00:57.180
his face is an expression of utter helplessness.

0:00:57.180,0:01:05.180
He cries because he is not only lame, but living in abject poverty.

0:01:05.180,0:01:08.020
What poverty this is!

0:01:08.020,0:01:12.980
Can you imagine what it would be like to crawl on your hands and feet

0:01:12.980,0:01:16.100
as your only option to get from place to place.

0:01:16.100,0:01:17.680
My name is Ajayi Ogunleye.

0:01:17.680,0:01:22.440
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that I am crippled; I cannot walk.

0:01:22.440,0:01:27.660
I don't have a helper unless God sends someone to bless me.

0:01:27.660,0:01:35.040
While sitting outside begging, I call any youth passing by to help me fetch water to bathe.

0:01:35.040,0:01:38.620
Sometimes, when I give people money and a plate to buy food for me,

0:01:38.620,0:01:40.020
they run away with it.

0:01:40.020,0:01:43.800
I am tired of all this; that is why I left there to come here.

0:01:43.800,0:01:45.500
I know that coming here, I will be healed.

0:01:45.500,0:01:51.640
Going home without healing, it would be better I die.

0:01:51.640,0:01:58.280
In search of even the basic necessities, he is here to meet Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:58.280,0:02:04.900
to care for his needs in terms of money, food, shelter, clothing,

0:02:04.900,0:02:08.000
or a wheelchair to aid his mobility.

0:02:08.000,0:02:15.540
Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua has been providing for others in the same situation as him.

0:02:15.540,0:02:17.880
He is seeking silver and gold.

0:02:17.880,0:02:20.720
But what is his essential need?

0:02:20.720,0:02:25.800
Is it silver and gold, or is it healing?

0:02:25.800,0:02:31.980
Look at his hands - calloused, rough and filthy

0:02:31.980,0:02:36.460
are the hands he uses to pull himself along the ground.

0:02:36.460,0:02:39.260
He reaches inside his ragged shirt

0:02:39.260,0:02:44.840
and brings out a soiled grobby sack which is tied around his neck.

0:02:44.840,0:02:51.300
From within the sack, he brings out a plastic bag containing all the money he has,

0:02:51.300,0:02:54.540
not even enough for a square meal.

0:02:54.540,0:02:56.720
Leaning to one side,

0:02:56.720,0:03:01.040
he shows the taterred foam padding he uses as a cushion

0:03:01.040,0:03:07.300
to make his moving a little less painful as he drags himself along.

0:03:07.300,0:03:14.180
The rough foam is all he has to protect himself from the hard earth, stones,

0:03:14.180,0:03:23.500
broken glass, nails, and other sharp objects he encounters all the time on his way.

0:03:23.500,0:03:30.560
He goes to wait for Prophet T.B. Joshua at the gate of The SCOAN

0:03:30.560,0:03:36.660
to ask for money and help just like the man at the Beautiful Gate in Acts 3

0:03:36.660,0:03:39.340
who asked for silver and gold.

0:03:39.340,0:03:44.520
But Apostle Peter, through the power of the Holy Spirit, gave him something

0:03:44.520,0:03:51.260
more than silver and gold - something that makes money insufficient.

0:03:51.260,0:03:54.200
He was given his essential needs.

0:03:54.200,0:03:57.400
Just exactly like the man at the Beautiful Gate,

0:03:57.400,0:04:03.320
this man sat at the gate of The SCOAN.

0:04:03.320,0:04:06.200
What could be his essential needs?

0:04:06.200,0:04:07.680
A wheel chair?

0:04:07.680,0:04:09.060
A house?

0:04:09.060,0:04:10.200
A meal?

0:04:10.200,0:04:11.880
A friend?

0:04:11.880,0:04:13.320
Is it money?

0:04:13.320,0:04:16.100
Or something more?

0:04:16.100,0:04:21.480
We pray his case would be like that of the man at the Beautiful Gate

0:04:21.480,0:04:27.720
who asked for money but instead received something more.

0:04:27.720,0:04:33.280
While Prophet T.B. Joshua was conducting the Sunday service, led by the Holy Spirit,

0:04:33.280,0:04:37.320
he moves outside the auditorium and walks through the street,

0:04:37.320,0:04:41.240
greeting members and receiving prayer requests.

0:04:41.240,0:04:46.120
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, is on his way to the gate.

0:04:46.120,0:04:49.180
He sights the man and heads straight for him,

0:04:49.180,0:04:53.560
not even stopping to ask what he was doing there or why he had come,

0:04:53.560,0:04:58.060
as if he was looking for someone in need of healing.

0:04:58.060,0:05:00.280
God can use any medium to heal.

0:05:00.280,0:05:05.480
In this case, He uses Prophet T.B. Joshua's shoe as a point of contact.

0:05:05.480,0:05:11.120
In the name of Jesus, rise up!

0:05:11.120,0:05:18.880
The man awkwardly rises to his feet for the first time in ten years.

0:05:18.880,0:05:21.700
Before he even takes his first step,

0:05:21.700,0:05:26.020
Prophet T.B. Joshua leaves, knowing that it has been done.

0:05:26.020,0:05:34.540
As he often says, "I am not the Healer, I know the Healer, His name is Jesus Christ",

0:05:34.540,0:05:37.540
Jesus has healed this man.

0:05:37.540,0:05:39.600
It is a miracle.

0:05:39.600,0:05:43.300
Members who saw what had happened came forward

0:05:43.300,0:05:46.160
and gathered around the man at the gate,

0:05:46.160,0:05:50.520
encouraging him to move his legs one after the other.

0:05:50.520,0:05:56.160
Not used to standing on his legs, he is understandably somewhat unstable.

0:05:56.160,0:06:02.920
With each wobbly step, his confidence grows that he is healed indeed.

0:06:02.920,0:06:09.260
That week, the man went to show his family a great thing God had done in his life.

0:06:09.260,0:06:14.360
Overjoyed, his family followed him to The SCOAN

0:06:14.360,0:06:19.960
to appreciate God's goodness, testifying to the glory of God.

0:06:19.960,0:06:25.020
Mr. Ajayi now beautifully dressed in white trousers with a shirt and tie,

0:06:25.020,0:06:31.380
proudly rises to his feet and walks in front of his family, demonstrating his healing.

0:06:31.380,0:06:42.160
Before and After

0:06:42.160,0:06:50.380
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:06:50.380,0:06:53.820
My name is Ajayi Ogunleye from Ondo State, Nigeria.

0:06:53.820,0:07:01.700
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was crippled.

0:07:01.700,0:07:05.120
I had been crippled for ten years.

0:07:05.120,0:07:10.580
Formerly, I was a herbalist. I tried to treat myself

0:07:10.580,0:07:18.700
and went to other herbalist friends but there was no way.

0:07:18.700,0:07:32.240
When I started begging to eat, I met a lady who introduced me to The SCOAN.

0:07:32.240,0:07:41.560
That was when I met Prophet T.B. Joshua, a picture of Jesus, in my dreams.

0:07:41.560,0:07:49.680
What I saw physically was that he put his foot on my legs and told me to stand up.

0:07:49.680,0:07:55.880
I stood up immediately. Since that time, I started to walk

0:07:55.880,0:08:00.920
and do everything by myself again. Today, I came from Akure by myself.

0:08:00.920,0:08:08.120
Therefore, I want the children of God to help me shout three times "Emmanuel".

0:08:08.120,0:08:15.020
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:15.020,0:08:22.320
The man of God did not collect any money from me.

0:08:22.320,0:08:30.060
My promise to God is to run from sin, to live the rest of my life for Jesus

0:08:30.060,0:08:37.860
and serve Him properly.

0:08:37.860,0:08:40.740
After sharing his heartwarming testimony,

0:08:40.740,0:08:45.500
Mr Ajayi stands up smartly and walks around the church auditorium.

0:08:45.500,0:08:46.740
Before and After

0:08:46.740,0:08:55.560
When Jesus says yes, no one can say no.

0:08:55.560,0:09:09.680
He is a mighty God.

0:09:09.680,0:09:14.220
Sharing his joy with the congregation and exchanging a few handshakes,

0:09:14.220,0:09:18.460
one can hardly believe that this gentleman was the same person

0:09:18.460,0:09:21.720
who crawled through the streets on his hands and feet.

0:09:21.720,0:09:28.400
When Jesus says yes, no one can say no.

0:09:28.400,0:09:33.560
When Jesus says it's Ok, no one can say no.

0:09:33.560,0:09:38.160
When Jesus says it's alright, no one can say no.

0:09:38.160,0:09:43.360
When Jesus says bless you, no one can say curse you.

0:09:43.360,0:09:55.140
Before and After

0:09:55.140,0:09:59.780
The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

0:09:59.780,0:10:04.960
Rejoicing with pilgrims to The SCOAN from all across the wold,

0:10:04.960,0:10:08.880
Mr Ajayi leads them in a processional dance.

0:10:08.880,0:10:13.700
Thank You, Jesus, for the man at the Beautiful Gate of our time.

0:10:13.700,0:10:14.200
