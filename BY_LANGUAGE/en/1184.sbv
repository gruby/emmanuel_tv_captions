0:00:00.000,0:00:02.900
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:02.900,0:00:05.040
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:05.040,0:00:12.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:12.040,0:00:16.340
Viewers all over the world, we salute your faith.

0:00:16.340,0:00:21.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:21.000,0:00:22.880
Thank You, Lord.

0:00:22.880,0:00:27.640
Today we talk about the Word - the Word of God.

0:00:27.640,0:00:31.760
As we all know: Faith is of man's heart.

0:00:31.760,0:00:34.500
And the Bible says in the Book of Romans:

0:00:34.500,0:00:40.440
Anything that does not come from faith is sin.

0:00:40.440,0:00:45.520
That is, anything that does not come from the heart.

0:00:45.520,0:00:50.640
So that is, man's spirit; it's sin, it's wrong.

0:00:50.640,0:00:52.880
Hallelujah!

0:00:52.880,0:01:02.920
Take your reading with me to the Book of Isaiah 55 Verse 10.

0:01:02.920,0:01:06.500
It will also be a very important passage for you to read.

0:01:06.500,0:01:10.740
We read the Book of Hebrews Chapter 4.

0:01:10.740,0:01:19.540
And also the Book of Ephesians 3; when you look at verse 17 there, it will also be of help.

0:01:19.540,0:01:23.480
John 3 will help us.

0:01:23.480,0:01:26.040
Hallelujah!

0:01:26.040,0:01:27.240
I can't hear you.

0:01:27.240,0:01:28.440
[Amen.]

0:01:28.440,0:01:36.560
Also take your reading from the Book of John 15; verse 17 too will be of help in our reading.

0:01:36.560,0:01:39.820
So let's take that Book of Hebrews.

0:01:39.820,0:01:42.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:42.620,0:01:50.960
"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands,

0:01:50.960,0:02:00.220
let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.

0:02:00.220,0:02:07.380
For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did;

0:02:07.380,0:02:14.060
but the message they heard was of no value to them

0:02:14.060,0:02:24.120
because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.

0:02:24.120,0:02:31.380
Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said..."

0:02:31.380,0:02:38.800
The word rest, rest rest - take note of that rest, rest.

0:02:38.800,0:02:46.120
"For anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works"

0:02:46.120,0:02:54.420
That is, also rests from their struggles, tension, pressure. Take note of that.

0:02:54.420,0:03:02.800
When you enter God's rest, you also rest from tension, pressure.

0:03:02.800,0:03:05.760
"...just as God did from his.

0:03:05.760,0:03:11.540
Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest.

0:03:11.540,0:03:20.260
so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.

0:03:20.260,0:03:31.760
For the Word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword..."

0:03:31.760,0:03:39.960
Like I have said, on getting home, read the Book of Isaiah 55:10; it will help.

0:03:39.960,0:03:43.920
Ephesians 3:17 will help.

0:03:43.920,0:03:46.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:46.760,0:03:51.360
FAITH IS OF MAN'S HEART

0:03:51.360,0:04:06.040
But, there is Bible language that God uses to save us,

0:04:06.040,0:04:19.100
to create us, to judge us and to rule over us - that is Bible language,

0:04:19.100,0:04:26.680
which is language of the heart.

0:04:26.680,0:04:46.100
Faith is of man's heart but today's language we use to gossip, give directions, do politics.

0:04:46.100,0:04:49.280
You know politics today all over the world.

0:04:49.280,0:04:52.220
Today's language is not Bible language

0:04:52.220,0:05:03.040
That is why it is difficult for Christians to involve in politics today

0:05:03.040,0:05:11.160
because they use today's language to do politics, even to do business,

0:05:11.160,0:05:15.440
to sing songs and to talk to our children.

0:05:15.440,0:05:18.600
We say, "Get out of this place, stupid!"

0:05:18.600,0:05:24.800
We don't mean it but the word of the heart means it.

0:05:24.800,0:05:31.000
Tthink of how many times you have booed your children,

0:05:31.000,0:05:36.320
"Get out of this place. Please, stupid, idiot."

0:05:36.320,0:05:42.780
You don't mean it but your heart means it.

0:05:42.780,0:05:44.960
Tell your neighbour.

0:05:44.960,0:05:51.520
That is why God's language is 'Word of Heart'; Bible language is 'Word of Heart'.

0:05:51.520,0:05:53.440
But you don't mean it.

0:05:53.440,0:05:57.800
A lot of business, when you check today you see many people with business cards.

0:05:57.800,0:06:06.000
"I am a contractor, I am an architect, I am a lawyer, I am an engineer, I am this" - a lot of business cards.

0:06:06.000,0:06:12.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:12.720,0:06:20.520
We use today's language to pray.

0:06:20.520,0:06:23.140
You see people today using today's language.

0:06:23.140,0:06:27.160
They don't even know the difference between the language of the Bible and today's language.

0:06:27.160,0:06:29.720
People use today's language to pray.

0:06:29.720,0:06:34.200
That is why whatever they say in their prayer, they don't mean it

0:06:34.200,0:06:43.160
and whatever they receive seems not to be permanent because it is mere words.

0:06:43.160,0:06:47.640
"Abide in me, come into my life, save my soul, I am a sinner.

0:06:47.640,0:06:51.940
Today, Lord Jesus, I will follow You to the end of my life."

0:06:51.940,0:06:55.180
But the next day, you will see them somewhere else.

0:06:55.180,0:06:58.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:58.160,0:07:04.940
Freedom today, bondage tomorrow because when you are receiving healing, you say,

0:07:04.940,0:07:08.680
"Lord, heal me, heal me. I will give my life to you. Heal me."

0:07:08.680,0:07:16.180
After your healing - because what you are saying is not from your heart.

0:07:16.180,0:07:25.060
So we use today's language to pray, to counsel, to prophesy.

0:07:25.060,0:07:29.120
You see some prophecies will say, "Ah, it will rain tomorrow".

0:07:29.120,0:07:33.480
But you will find that there is no rain because they don't mean what they are saying.

0:07:33.480,0:07:41.480
It is not from their hearts.

0:07:41.480,0:07:47.880
FAITH IS OF MAN'S HEART

0:07:47.880,0:08:03.600
When the Word is in your heart, it will preserve you from desiring sin.

0:08:03.600,0:08:06.680
That is the Word of God.

0:08:06.680,0:08:13.380
You need the Word of God in your heart to bring Jesus to the scene.

0:08:13.380,0:08:17.040
You cannot say, " In Jesus' name," and expect Jesus,

0:08:17.040,0:08:20.040
when what you are saying is not from your heart.

0:08:20.040,0:08:26.420
When you don't mean it and you say, "In Jesus' name. Lord Jesus, do this for me, give me this" -

0:08:26.420,0:08:33.000
all what you are saying is not from your heart and you are expecting Jesus to come.

0:08:33.000,0:08:44.700
The Word in your heart can only bring Jesus to the scene.

0:08:44.700,0:08:51.760
The Word of God is the living presence of that divine power

0:08:51.760,0:08:54.260
if that Word  comes from the heart.

0:08:54.260,0:08:56.020
Are you with me?

0:08:56.020,0:08:58.300
If that Word comes from the heart;

0:08:58.300,0:09:08.280
it is the living presence of that divine power that heals, saves and delivers.

0:09:08.280,0:09:12.860
But if the Word is not from the heart, you are just talking to yourself;

0:09:12.860,0:09:15.880
you are saying the word of today.

0:09:15.880,0:09:28.680
People use the word of today to pray, to counsel, to evangelise, to prophesy.

0:09:28.680,0:09:34.940
You say, "Ah, I don't want to smoke it". You come to church, you don't want to smoke.

0:09:34.940,0:09:39.760
If this word is not from your heart, it cannot influence your conduct and character.

0:09:39.760,0:09:48.160
It is the Word from the heart that can influence your conduct and character.

0:09:48.160,0:10:00.000
The Word from the heart takes the place of the unseen Jesus.

0:10:00.000,0:10:07.760
Meditation in the Word is a visit with God.

0:10:07.760,0:10:09.300
In Jesus' name.

0:10:09.300,0:10:16.500
That meditation from the heart - a visit to Jesus.

0:10:16.500,0:10:29.180
You become a part of the Word by meditation.

0:10:29.180,0:10:32.500
You have to get hold of your heart.

0:10:32.500,0:10:35.540
What is going on in your heart?

0:10:35.540,0:10:44.660
Locate me in Your mercy, oh Lord. 
More of You.

0:10:44.660,0:10:51.020
This should continue; your heart should continue saying this while looking at me.

0:10:51.020,0:10:53.120
Meditation brings revelation.

0:10:53.120,0:10:59.580
By the time you are busy saying this, you will suddenly see who is talking here.

0:10:59.580,0:11:07.680
I'm not the one talking, but because you are not in the vision, you are not inspired yet.

0:11:07.680,0:11:12.780
You are still seeing a man talking to you. No, I'm not the one talking to you.

0:11:12.780,0:11:17.680
You have to know, you have to see who is talking to you now.

0:11:17.680,0:11:20.660
By revelation.

0:11:20.660,0:11:23.660
Meditation brings revelation.

0:11:23.660,0:11:30.560
Continue, turn it over and over again in your heart

0:11:30.560,0:11:35.380
Locate me in Your mercy, Lord Jesus.

0:11:35.380,0:11:41.200
Take more of me; give me more of You -  more of Your faithfulness,

0:11:41.200,0:11:47.580
more of Your obedience, more of Your purity, holiness, Lord.

0:11:47.580,0:11:52.660
Busy, busy then the revelation comes; you will now see who is talking.

0:11:52.660,0:11:58.380
You will see that this is not the man that is talking, "Aha I said it; he is not the one".

0:11:58.380,0:12:02.820
Now after the revelation, God will take you back again to your real self.

0:12:02.820,0:12:04.820
You will now say, "Oh, I'm back again".

0:12:04.820,0:12:08.180
You switch again; this is the life you should live.

0:12:08.180,0:12:12.080
Switch on, on.

0:12:12.080,0:12:16.200
There are a lot of melodies that should be going on in your heart,

0:12:16.200,0:12:20.580
a lot of spiritual songs, hymns.

0:12:20.580,0:12:27.880
You have songs; you know a lot of songs you can continue to engage your heart with.

0:12:27.880,0:12:32.520
I have seen the downfall of satan

0:12:32.520,0:12:37.040
Glory be to God
Glory be to Jesus

0:12:37.040,0:12:40.240
That should continue in your heart.

0:12:40.240,0:12:43.080
I have seen the downfall of satan

0:12:43.080,0:12:48.960
Glory be to God
Amen

0:12:48.960,0:12:53.840
Continue in your heart.

0:12:53.840,0:12:55.920
Continue this in your heart.

0:12:55.920,0:13:02.620
Keep your heart busy while looking at me.

0:13:02.620,0:13:09.780
If you cannot see beyond me, it means you are not engaged in God's project.

0:13:09.780,0:13:14.460
You must see beyond me to believe.

0:13:14.460,0:13:15.340
Tell your neighbour

0:13:15.340,0:13:22.000
You must see beyond your pastor to believe.

0:13:22.000,0:13:23.780
Just your pastor you used to see.

0:13:23.780,0:13:26.960
Every day you go to church, you see your pastor moving.

0:13:26.960,0:13:29.840
No. You cannot believe.

0:13:29.840,0:13:34.460
You must see beyond your pastor. Beyond him is the Person talking.

0:13:34.460,0:13:35.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:13:35.220,0:13:39.260
Beyond him - the Person talking .

0:13:39.260,0:13:42.480
Beyond him - the Person preaching.

0:13:42.480,0:13:44.440
That is all. It is not your pastor.

0:13:44.440,0:13:46.160
You keep seeing your pastor every day.

0:13:46.160,0:13:50.760
You are not going to church; you are just a religious person.

0:13:50.760,0:13:54.080
Religious person - that is all.

0:13:54.080,0:14:02.680
You must see beyond. To see beyond is that meditation.

0:14:07.000,0:14:09.760
What will hinder us?

0:14:09.760,0:14:14.600
What is the reason why you cannot do what I am asking you to do now?

0:14:14.600,0:14:19.760
What will hinder us?

0:14:19.760,0:14:30.420
Our human nature will.

0:14:30.420,0:14:38.500
This has a lot to do with hindering God when there are some mixtures -

0:14:38.500,0:14:55.100
part spirit, part flesh in the heart of man, a constant conflict between flesh and spirit.

0:14:55.100,0:14:58.180
Some will say, "Don't listen to him. - Listen to him.

0:14:58.180,0:15:01.100
Is it possible what he is saying? - It is possible.

0:15:01.100,0:15:08.720
Ah, I don't know; what is that? - No, I have tried it before, try it again".

0:15:08.720,0:15:14.640
A constant conflict between flesh and spirit.

0:15:14.640,0:15:23.620
A struggle between faith and doubt .

0:15:23.620,0:15:26.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:26.540,0:15:33.100
Little time you say, "Take more of me, give me more of You. Locate me in Your mercy.

0:15:33.100,0:15:37.460
Ah, what does the time say?"

0:15:37.460,0:15:40.500
You have abandoned what you are meditating.

0:15:40.500,0:15:46.180
"Take more of me. Give me more of You."

0:15:46.180,0:15:53.440
After little time you say, "Can you help me? Just switch that station, the channel to…"

0:15:53.440,0:15:55.640
You have forgotten what you are talking.

0:15:55.640,0:16:00.860
A struggle between faith and doubt.

0:16:00.860,0:16:15.740
A constant conflict between flesh and spirit when there is division in the heart of man.

0:16:15.740,0:16:27.560
John 3 says, find out the truth and the truth will set you free.

0:16:27.560,0:16:38.620
Wrong, mistake, sin is never covered by our appearance.

0:16:38.620,0:16:48.640
You put on tie, collar, big Bible, cross, garment, big cap.

0:16:48.640,0:17:05.420
Sin, wrong, mistake is never covered by our appearance, presence, prayer or tears.

0:17:05.420,0:17:11.420
Sin is never covered.

0:17:11.420,0:17:24.060
Sin can only be removed by repentance.

0:17:24.060,0:17:29.360
If our appearance cannot cover our sin, our mistake,

0:17:29.360,0:17:42.500
why are we wasting our time over appearance as if it is part of the deal.

0:17:42.500,0:17:49.760
How you look cannot cover your sin, your mistake.

0:17:49.760,0:18:00.960
Your presence whatever majestic has nothing to do with this.

0:18:00.960,0:18:09.340
You must bring your wrong, your mistake, your sin before the Blood of Jesus

0:18:09.340,0:18:11.700
before the Spirit prays through you.

0:18:11.700,0:18:13.440
Tell your neighbour again.

0:18:13.440,0:18:24.020
I must bring my wrong, my mistake, my sin before the  Blood of Jesus

0:18:24.020,0:18:29.460
before the Spirit prays through me.

0:18:29.460,0:18:32.440
We don't know how to pray; the Spirit prays.

0:18:32.440,0:18:40.080
We cannot do the work of God; the Spirit of God does.

0:18:40.080,0:18:42.080
Think about that.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:10.760,0:22:13.420
Where shall we start now?

0:22:13.420,0:22:16.540
I'm talking about your life.

0:22:16.540,0:22:19.860
You cannot continue this way.

0:22:19.860,0:22:23.760
You have much, much, much to do.

0:22:23.760,0:22:26.360
Don't let your age deceive you.

0:22:26.360,0:22:29.360
Don't let your wealth deceive you.

0:22:29.360,0:22:32.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:32.520,0:22:37.900
It is the Spirit of God that can maintain when it comes to maintenance.

0:22:37.900,0:22:47.540
You can achieve in whatever way but to  maintain, nothing can maintain it except God.

0:22:47.540,0:22:50.300
There is no way you can maintain your career.

0:22:50.300,0:22:56.480
Look at our leaders, our heroes, the most powerful in the world - you read about them.

0:22:56.480,0:23:06.060
Many of them failed to maintain their profile.

0:23:06.060,0:23:09.740
That you do not mean what you are saying does not mean you cannot receive healing.

0:23:09.740,0:23:13.700
You will receive healing, if you don't mean it. You say, "Ok, let me just come here".

0:23:13.700,0:23:16.120
And you don't mean what you are saying but you have problems.

0:23:16.120,0:23:22.220
The problem can be solved but to maintain that...

0:23:22.220,0:23:25.600
It is better not to receive than to lose.

0:23:25.600,0:23:31.360
But the people that say "Congratulations!" will later see you and say, "What is wrong again?"

0:23:31.360,0:23:35.440
You start crying, "What is all this?"

0:23:35.440,0:23:39.780
This is why I am asking, where shall we start?

0:23:39.780,0:23:48.120
Since we know what hinders us is our human nature.

0:23:48.120,0:23:49.360
Like I have said:

0:23:49.360,0:23:55.640
This has a lot to do with hindering God in your life.

0:23:55.640,0:23:56.560
Tell your neighbour.

0:23:56.560,0:24:09.440
This has a lot to do with hindering God in our life

0:24:09.440,0:24:20.220
when the human will is not wholly surrendered

0:24:20.220,0:24:24.860
Your will refuses to surrender.

0:24:24.860,0:24:38.900
You want to go there and the will of God says, "No, don't go", and you say, "I will go".

0:24:38.900,0:24:43.000
There is a discretion everyone has; you have discretion.

0:24:43.000,0:24:45.500
Look at the man at the pool of Bethesda.

0:24:45.500,0:24:49.240
Jesus asked him, "What can I do for you?"

0:24:49.240,0:24:52.260
He had the power and the grace to carry him.

0:24:52.260,0:24:57.260
When you are in trouble, let Him carry you; drop him in this pool.

0:24:57.260,0:25:05.000
Instead he said, "Oh, what can I do for you? Do you want me to help you or not?"

0:25:05.000,0:25:07.300
And the man said, "Please, help me".

0:25:07.300,0:25:13.920
You have discretion; that discretion is a special blessing for you.

0:25:13.920,0:25:17.720
You can say, "No, what T.B. Joshua is saying is nonsense.

0:25:17.720,0:25:20.360
I can't understand what he is saying".

0:25:20.360,0:25:23.680
You have the right.

0:25:23.680,0:25:26.400
I surrender

0:25:26.400,0:25:43.600
I surrender all

0:25:43.600,0:25:53.260
All to Thee
My blessed Saviour

0:25:53.260,0:26:18.660
I surrender all

0:26:18.660,0:26:32.440
All to Thee
My blessed Saviour

0:26:32.440,0:26:42.140
I surrender all

0:26:42.140,0:27:01.260
All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give

0:27:01.260,0:27:20.500
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live

0:27:20.500,0:27:35.580
I surrender all

0:27:35.580,0:27:49.080
All to Thee
My blessed Saviour

0:27:49.080,0:28:00.660
I surrender all

0:28:00.660,0:28:18.080
Part spirit, part flesh - a constant conflict between flesh and spirit.

0:28:18.080,0:28:22.720
That is the struggle you are going through,

0:28:22.720,0:28:29.740
A constant conflict between flesh and spirit.

0:28:29.740,0:28:35.160
If God is coming, your heart is the contact point

0:28:35.160,0:28:42.340
but in that heart, there is a constant conflict.

0:28:42.340,0:28:45.060
There is a battle.

0:28:45.060,0:28:48.000
Go - don't go.

0:28:48.000,0:28:52.280
Take - don't take.

0:28:52.280,0:29:00.240
This is where you are.

0:29:00.240,0:29:06.040
When you want to pray, "Lord Jesus, help me to get there",

0:29:06.040,0:29:14.520
something will be telling you too, "You will not get there".

0:29:14.520,0:29:15.800
This is why I am saying,

0:29:15.800,0:29:20.720
don't let your wealth deceive you; you have not got there.

0:29:20.720,0:29:25.020
The richest man in your family - you say, "Oh, he has succeeded"; you want to be like him.

0:29:25.020,0:29:30.300
How do you know he has succeeded? Because of wealth?

0:29:30.300,0:29:34.160
Man's natural gift cannot make one succeed.

0:29:34.160,0:29:42.500
Success is all about the spirit, supernatural.

0:29:42.500,0:29:47.660
You can suddenly die and leave, and the enemy will start sharing them.

0:29:47.660,0:29:57.640
If our leaders know this, superiority complex and all these fights, will cease -

0:29:57.640,0:30:04.340
if they know they are not what they think they are.

0:30:04.340,0:30:08.200
Vanity upon vanity.

0:30:08.200,0:30:17.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:17.780,0:30:21.340
What shall I render

0:30:21.340,0:30:36.860
What shall I render
What shall I render to You oh Lord

0:30:36.860,0:30:45.180
I will praise You oh Lord
And shout hallelujah

0:30:45.180,0:30:53.740
What shall I render to You oh Lord

0:30:53.740,0:31:10.020
What shall I render
What shall I render to You oh Lord

0:31:10.020,0:31:18.320
I will praise You oh Lord
And shout hallelujah

0:31:18.320,0:31:26.900
What shall I render to You oh Lord

0:31:26.900,0:31:33.900
What your heart is telling you, saying about you, is what you are.

0:31:33.900,0:31:36.980
What your heart is telling you now is what you are.

0:31:36.980,0:31:38.780
Tell your neighbour.

0:31:38.780,0:31:41.400
What your heart is telling you now is what you are.

0:31:41.400,0:31:43.660
Tell yourself. Speak to yourself.

0:31:43.660,0:31:47.140
What my heart is telling me now is what I am.

0:31:47.140,0:31:50.840
Listen to your heart.

0:31:50.840,0:31:56.600
When you wake up in the morning and you want to go somewhere, just listen to your heart.

0:31:56.600,0:31:59.520
Your heart will say, "Go; don't go".

0:31:59.520,0:32:04.200
Heart is about meditation.

0:32:04.200,0:32:10.760
You have been living in a thinking processing, not meditation processing.

0:32:10.760,0:32:11.600
Tell your neighbour.

0:32:11.600,0:32:19.320
You have been living in a thinking processing, not meditation processing.

0:32:19.320,0:32:26.840
There is a difference - meditation is about God; thinking is about our problems.

0:32:26.840,0:32:33.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:33.880,0:32:40.420
People can see you as a poor man but your heart is telling you, "You are great".

0:32:40.420,0:32:44.080
Indeed, you are great.

0:32:44.080,0:32:49.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:49.100,0:32:56.220
You see a poor man and it is hard to be saying, "Oh, you are great".

0:32:56.220,0:32:58.440
Indeed he is great.

0:32:58.440,0:33:04.660
But while you rich, your heart will be telling you, "You are the poorest in the world".

0:33:04.660,0:33:10.420
Upon the culture, money you are seeing - yet the heart is saying it is poor.

0:33:10.420,0:33:15.880
So it means such money will not last.

0:33:15.880,0:33:30.220
Whatever you cannot enjoy to the last is not of God.

0:33:30.220,0:33:33.620
If what you are cannot be witnessed by generations yet unborn

0:33:33.620,0:33:44.860
it means it is not for generations and God is of generations.

0:33:44.860,0:33:47.280
God is of generations.

0:33:47.280,0:33:51.700
Whatever you are that cannot be witnessed by generations yet unborn,

0:33:51.700,0:33:56.720
is not of God because God is of generations.

0:33:56.720,0:33:59.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:59.440,0:34:05.540
So, please, let's build our life.

0:34:05.540,0:34:13.620
Commit your life to God for generations yet unborn to witness and see.

0:34:13.620,0:34:25.600
What you are enjoying today, some had paid the supreme price to bring them.

0:34:25.600,0:34:27.960
Heart means, 'mean it'.

0:34:27.960,0:34:29.080
Tell your neighbour

0:34:29.080,0:34:31.280
Heart means, 'mean it'.

0:34:31.280,0:34:32.600
I can't understand.

0:34:32.600,0:34:39.060
Heart means, 'mean it'.

0:34:39.060,0:34:43.040
Whatever comes from the heart, we mean it.

0:34:43.040,0:34:51.120
This is why each time I'm praying for you, I say, "Mean it, mean it".

0:34:51.120,0:34:55.440
It is a place where there is no doubt.

0:34:55.440,0:34:56.740
Mean it.

0:34:56.740,0:35:00.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:00.880,0:35:04.200
Mean it. Mean what you are saying.

0:35:04.200,0:35:17.380
In your heart, talk to yourself in hymns, songs and melodies.

0:35:17.380,0:35:22.200
We are created to keep our heart busy with the Lord.

0:35:22.200,0:35:26.400
Keep your heart praising God; that is what you are created for.

0:35:26.400,0:35:31.220
Our heart must be busy praising God.

0:35:31.220,0:35:33.100
But your heart has been...

0:35:33.100,0:35:35.100
Can you imagine how old you are now?

0:35:35.100,0:35:36.820
Your heart has been roaming about.

0:35:36.820,0:35:40.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:40.280,0:35:48.300
We are created to keep our heart busy for God, praising God.

0:35:48.300,0:35:51.860
Busy, busy, busy.

0:35:51.860,0:35:57.640
At the beginning, it may look very difficult.

0:35:57.640,0:36:02.260
The beginning of everything is always very difficult.

0:36:02.260,0:36:06.420
But as time goes on, it will be part of you.

0:36:06.420,0:36:15.600
Keep your heart praising God.

0:36:15.600,0:36:32.940
I will praise You
I will praise You forever more

0:36:32.940,0:36:35.580
For Your goodness

0:36:35.580,0:36:54.680
I will praise You
I will praise You forever more

0:36:54.680,0:36:57.420
For your kindness

0:36:57.420,0:37:19.720
I will praise You
I will praise You forever more

0:37:19.720,0:37:28.160
Keep your heart praising God in songs, hymns and melodies.

0:37:28.160,0:37:35.780
That is what you were created for, and when you start this, you will come back and give testimony.

0:37:35.780,0:37:43.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:43.900,0:37:49.100
Yes, you are supposed to know God's opinion about yourself.

0:37:49.100,0:37:55.680
No matter what you are, no matter what you acquire, no matter how great you are,

0:37:55.680,0:37:59.700
if you don't know God's opinion about yourself and about others,

0:37:59.700,0:38:05.120
whatever you acquire is zero.

0:38:05.120,0:38:08.500
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:38:08.500,0:38:09.520
Tell your neighbor

0:38:09.520,0:38:12.920
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:38:12.920,0:38:14.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:38:14.080,0:38:17.220
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:38:17.220,0:38:18.280
Tell your neighbour.

0:38:18.280,0:38:21.400
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:38:21.400,0:38:22.540
I can't hear you.

0:38:22.540,0:38:25.860
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:38:25.860,0:38:27.100
Again and again.

0:38:27.100,0:38:30.760
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:38:30.760,0:38:40.960
Yes. because your spiritual life is the engine that will carry your success.

0:38:40.960,0:38:48.540
If you prosper financially and you are just like a little baby in your spiritual life,

0:38:48.540,0:38:52.320
that money you have will be spent by the enemy.

0:38:52.320,0:38:59.100
You take it to care for sickness, to run from one problem to another,

0:38:59.100,0:39:02.940
to run for medical Check-up.

0:39:02.940,0:39:11.880
You will realise that the money will be spending you instead of you spending the money.

0:39:11.880,0:39:15.860
You know money can be spending one.

0:39:15.860,0:39:22.380
You are supposed to spend your money but instead, the money will now be the one to spend you.

0:39:22.380,0:39:25.500
You will not be able to eat any food you want to eat.

0:39:25.500,0:39:29.400
There will be certain food you should not eat and certain food you should eat.

0:39:29.400,0:39:32.880
If you try to eat other food, you will be in trouble.

0:39:32.880,0:39:39.080
You have so much medication you have to take in the morning, afternoon, evening.

0:39:39.080,0:39:43.880
You start seeing yourself that way.

0:39:43.880,0:39:57.600
The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life

0:39:57.600,0:40:02.360
If you are not prospering in your spiritual life and you are great,

0:40:02.360,0:40:18.000
your greatness will be fading away gradually because there is nothing to carry it.

0:40:18.000,0:40:21.300
So that is why you have to take your time.

0:40:21.300,0:40:24.660
Leave that money, pray.

0:40:24.660,0:40:27.600
Find time to pray; don't let money control you.

0:40:27.600,0:40:39.500
Let the Giver of that money control you.

0:40:39.500,0:40:42.620
But today, what is happening? Where are you living?

0:40:42.620,0:40:44.780
Because you have money, where you were living before,

0:40:44.780,0:40:47.920
you have to leave the place and live where rich people live.

0:40:47.920,0:40:52.920
Money is the one controlling you.

0:40:52.920,0:40:55.360
Do you know where you started?

0:40:55.360,0:40:58.100
Do you know your beginning? Where are you living now?

0:40:58.100,0:41:02.320
You live among the rich because you are a rich man.

0:41:02.320,0:41:07.860
That is money control; not the Giver of the money.

0:41:07.860,0:41:12.160
The rich are living together and the poor are living together. Who will help the poor?

0:41:12.160,0:41:23.780
And you are blessed to bless others.

0:41:23.780,0:41:27.200
You are blessed to bless others; you are saved to save others -

0:41:27.200,0:41:29.100
that is the purpose of your blessing.

0:41:29.100,0:41:31.260
You are blessed to bless others.

0:41:31.260,0:41:40.020
This is the cause of the problem now all over the world.

0:41:40.020,0:41:48.100
If God gives you breakthrough and you become so rich, and you are now mismanaging, misbehaving.

0:41:48.100,0:41:51.480
His peace you cannot run away with.

0:41:51.480,0:42:04.420
You can run away with riches, wealth but His peace of heart, you cannot run away with.

0:42:04.420,0:42:08.960
So like people sitting down now, they are looking for prayer, they want prayer.

0:42:08.960,0:42:13.880
You are here for breakthrough in your business but after the prayer, you have breakthrough,

0:42:13.880,0:42:19.700
billions of dollars - you receive it , and then you say, "Ah, I have received it" and you run from God.

0:42:19.700,0:42:22.860
But His peace, you cannot go away with it.

0:42:22.860,0:42:30.920
You will run away with the money, run away with wealth, run away with the fame, but the peace of God...

0:42:30.920,0:42:36.840
God will be looking at you to see the money you have taken, He has given you -

0:42:36.840,0:42:42.380
how you spend it will determine the peace of God in your heart.

So this is what is happening all over the world today.

0:42:48.640,0:42:56.620
This why you see so many rich, wealthy people all over the world without peace.

0:42:56.620,0:43:00.000
How do we know that they don't have peace?

0:43:00.000,0:43:06.400
The conflict among them will tell you that these people have no peace.

0:43:06.400,0:43:13.760
But if you have peace of heart, people are insulting you, beating you, you will be saying, "Take it easy".

0:43:13.760,0:43:17.840
Peace does not want conflict. He wants peace.

0:43:17.840,0:43:24.220
Peace is always fighting for peace, unity, love.

0:43:24.220,0:43:30.640
When He gives you that greatness, He will hold on with this peace to be monitoring you

0:43:30.640,0:43:33.640
to see how you go about your greatness.

0:43:33.640,0:43:41.400
That will determine how He will release the peace.

0:43:41.400,0:43:50.640
So please, the first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.

0:43:50.640,0:43:53.240
You are to go back to your drawing board.

0:43:53.240,0:43:57.260
Tell your neighbour, "Go back".

0:43:57.260,0:44:04.840
Go back to the college of God and seek the Spirit of God.

0:44:04.840,0:44:08.960
Yes, you are to go back.

0:44:08.960,0:44:20.980
If you know you have plenty - money, property - please, go back.

0:44:20.980,0:44:25.540
Man live without peace.

0:44:25.540,0:44:32.300
Are you one of them?

0:44:32.300,0:44:36.960
God bless His Word.
