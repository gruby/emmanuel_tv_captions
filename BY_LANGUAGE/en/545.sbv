0:00:00.000,0:00:06.400
There is a woman there, a young woman, I don't want her to be shy.

0:00:06.420,0:00:10.820
It's like your parents forced you to marry a man.

0:00:10.840,0:00:14.680
After marrying the man, you have a child with the man.

0:00:14.680,0:00:17.100
You are dressed in a native attire.

0:00:17.160,0:00:23.000
What is happening now is that your eyes have been opened.

0:00:23.020,0:00:26.560
You want to leave the marriage. Please come forward.

0:00:26.600,0:00:32.440
You are well-educated. Very beautiful. Every quality - you have it.

0:00:32.440,0:00:37.240
You realised that this man is nothing. Now, there is no affection.

0:00:37.280,0:00:40.380
You want to leave the marriage. You have an issue. Please come forward.

0:00:40.380,0:00:41.540
You are there.

0:00:41.580,0:00:50.300
You are there. This issue is very pathetic. I am calling you out, because only Jesus can settle this.

0:00:50.300,0:00:51.980
Watch your screen.

0:01:00.220,0:01:02.500
Watch your screen.

0:01:02.520,0:01:06.400
I am the person, sir. I was forced to marry a man,

0:01:06.440,0:01:13.680
when I was 19 years old. Now, I don't have any affection for him.

0:01:13.680,0:01:19.480
I don't even want to see him, now. I want to leave the marriage.

0:01:19.480,0:01:25.000
I have a son with him, who is 2 years old.

0:01:25.080,0:01:27.640
Why do you want to leave the marriage ?

0:01:27.680,0:01:31.100
I don't have affection for him. I don't love him.

0:01:31.140,0:01:35.700
At the beginning, how did you people get married ?

0:01:35.700,0:01:42.400
I was introduced to him by his sister. I didn't know him before.

0:01:42.460,0:01:45.300
What (gender) is the child you have with the man ?

0:01:45.320,0:01:47.180
I have a son with him.

0:01:47.180,0:01:49.300
A boy. 2 years old.

0:01:49.340,0:01:52.520
What do you want to do ? Can't you see that son

0:01:52.520,0:01:54.620
is very important to you.

0:01:54.620,0:01:56.620
He is very important to me.

0:01:56.680,0:02:00.900
You look good, your appearance, what is your secret ?

0:02:00.900,0:02:05.900
Do you mean that your man is not financially supporting you?

0:02:05.920,0:02:08.660
Or  that he's not the secret of you looking good ?

0:02:08.660,0:02:11.220
He is a good man. He is taking good care of me.

0:02:11.220,0:02:14.220
Anything  I ask for, he will give it to me.

0:02:20.900,0:02:24.600
My daughter, my sister,

0:02:24.640,0:02:30.300
I want to see the man. I want to see your son. I want to see you.

0:02:30.380,0:02:34.800
We hold a meeting. You people go through deliverance.

0:02:34.800,0:02:41.200
Now, it is the will of God.

0:02:41.280,0:02:45.820
Thank you, my Lord. Thank you.

0:02:45.820,0:02:51.720
After deliverance you will have that affection you don't have for him.

0:02:51.720,0:02:55.200
Everything will be alright.

0:02:55.200,0:02:58.180
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

0:03:03.620,0:03:06.300
Standard For Life

0:03:06.320,0:03:12.900
This is a house that is about to be destroyed, separated, scattered.

0:03:12.960,0:03:15.200
The question now is, what God is saying ?

0:03:15.200,0:03:17.700
Ok, let the husband and wife come out.

0:03:17.760,0:03:29.000
Watch your screen as they are now coming out.

0:03:29.040,0:03:32.880
I am just meeting my brother for the first time, now.

0:03:32.880,0:03:34.300
My brother,

0:03:34.320,0:03:38.160
we are here today to settle your home, and

0:03:38.160,0:03:41.940
to make sure that there is peace in your house.

0:03:41.940,0:03:46.100
And to hear God's opinion, on what does God say about this issue.

0:03:46.140,0:03:50.020
What you have in mind does not matter but what God says.

0:03:50.020,0:03:52.700
So lets hear it.

0:03:52.740,0:03:55.800
My name is Ufemia Eze.

0:03:55.800,0:03:58.640
Here with me is my husband, Bassey Eze.

0:03:58.660,0:04:02.200
And my son, Victor Eze.

0:04:02.200,0:04:06.920
We are all from Enugu State.

0:04:06.920,0:04:12.140
I am here to confirm the prophecy to be perfectly true for my life.

0:04:12.160,0:04:16.780
That's the problem which brought me here to the SCOAN.

0:04:16.780,0:04:20.400
The man is God said that there was a young woman here.

0:04:20.420,0:04:24.920
It's like your parents forced you to marry a certain man.

0:04:24.920,0:04:28.240
Now your eyes are opened, you want to leave the marriage.

0:04:28.240,0:04:31.500
You have a son for him.

0:04:31.520,0:04:35.480
I am here to confirm the prophecy to be perfectly true, because

0:04:35.480,0:04:40.180
I prayed and fasted asking God that I wanted to know His opinion about this marriage.

0:04:40.180,0:04:44.700
I want to know if this marriage is from God.

0:04:44.700,0:04:48.800
I want to know from God, either for me to continue with this marriage

0:04:48.800,0:04:52.620
or to divorce.

0:04:52.620,0:04:57.300
Last Sunday, God answered my prayer.

0:04:57.300,0:05:00.980
It's true. I used to think about leaving this marriage.

0:05:00.980,0:05:06.900
The reasons are: he is much older than I am.

0:05:06.940,0:05:09.920
He is 17 years older than I am.

0:05:09.920,0:05:13.360
When I married him. I didn't know anything about love in a marriage.

0:05:13.360,0:05:18.100
Now, I don't have love for him. I don't have affection for him.

0:05:18.140,0:05:20.360
Whenever I see him, I have hatred for him.

0:05:20.360,0:05:22.500
I don't want to see him at all.

0:05:22.500,0:05:26.720
There was a time I told him that I wanted to go and stay on in the village.

0:05:26.720,0:05:29.160
So that we would be seeing each other only once in a while.

0:05:29.160,0:05:32.140
Because I don't want to see him. Whenever I see him....

0:05:32.140,0:05:33.700
I only have hatred for him.

0:05:33.720,0:05:38.700
There was a time we stayed 5 good months in the same room.

0:05:38.700,0:05:42.320
on the same bed without making love, because the affection was not there.

0:05:42.320,0:05:46.180
I do see strange men making love to me  in my dream.

0:05:46.180,0:05:51.460
I do see dead people in dreams. I even fly in my dream.

0:05:51.480,0:05:54.700
Are you ready to listen to the voice of God ?

0:05:54.700,0:05:57.620
Yes. That's why I am here.

0:05:57.620,0:05:59.360
Who is TB Joshua?

0:05:59.360,0:06:00.880
He is man of God.

0:06:00.880,0:06:13.600
Before I tell you the voice of God. I want you to be on your knees in front of this man.

0:06:13.660,0:06:17.380
You need deliverance.

0:06:17.380,0:06:19.700
You just need deliverance.

0:06:19.700,0:06:23.300
You have a spiritual husband.

0:06:23.300,0:06:26.480
This spiritual husband has married you.

0:06:26.480,0:06:30.360
After yours deliverance you would know this is a nice man.

0:06:30.360,0:06:37.400
This is the man you need to marry.

0:06:37.420,0:06:40.820
Those things you consider... You said he's 17 years older than you are.

0:06:40.860,0:06:51.100
You are very lucky to have this man.

0:06:51.140,0:06:54.080
Handsome and beauty.

0:06:54.080,0:07:00.060
This man would go to work from morning till night and give you the entire amount of money.

0:07:00.060,0:07:11.200
You use it to do crayon and pencils.

0:07:11.280,0:07:17.700
Look at this handsome man, good looking man.

0:07:17.760,0:07:23.400
It's not your fault. Because he told you his age.

0:07:23.420,0:07:26.260
You just need deliverance.

0:07:38.640,0:07:42.700
Father,  thank you Lord.

0:07:42.700,0:07:48.900
In Jesus Christ name.

0:07:48.920,0:07:50.600
Stand up.

0:07:50.640,0:07:55.800
Give your husband a kiss.

0:07:55.820,0:07:58.600
Mouth to mouth.

0:08:14.000,0:08:15.660
Hallelujah !

0:08:15.660,0:08:21.000
It's all about this spiritual husband.

0:08:21.060,0:08:25.700
You will start to see the affection now, right as I'm talking now.

0:08:25.780,0:08:28.900
You will go to the mountain and thank God.

0:08:28.960,0:08:30.020
So, thank you.

0:08:30.040,0:08:34.000
I don't want to hear anything from my brother. I am meeting him for the first time.

0:08:34.020,0:08:38.480
He only sees the way his wife has been behaving, keeping distance.

0:08:38.480,0:08:41.820
She doesn't want a touch, or anything. But he is hearing

0:08:41.820,0:08:47.400
this for the first time that his wife wants to leave the marriage.

0:08:47.460,0:08:56.500
I need to meet him. And that is the end.

0:08:56.500,0:09:01.640
The issue is not the outward beauty, we are talking of the inner one.

0:09:01.640,0:09:06.160
This brother is very very handsome on the inside.

0:09:06.160,0:09:09.600
While this lady is beautiful on the outside.

0:09:09.620,0:09:13.280
The reason why man and woman come together...

0:09:13.280,0:09:19.920
When the husband is weak, the wife is strong. When the wife is weak, the husband is strong.

0:09:19.940,0:09:22.120
They help each other.

0:09:22.120,0:09:23.700
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

0:09:23.720,0:09:29.600
