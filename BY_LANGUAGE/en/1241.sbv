On the 21st of October, 2018, during The SCOAN Live Sunday Service,

0:00:06.280,0:00:11.420
Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered a prophetic message regarding an ex-president.

0:00:11.420,0:00:13.600
These were his words.

0:00:13.600,0:00:17.320
For some time now, I have not been dabbling into international issues.

0:00:17.320,0:00:19.400
This one is very close.

0:00:19.400,0:00:23.980
A president who is very sick outside this country,

0:00:23.980,0:00:26.820
I am seeing death; this is death.

0:00:26.820,0:00:31.180
They will try to revive him but no way.

0:00:31.180,0:00:33.540
He has been an ex before now.

0:00:33.540,0:00:36.520
They will try all efforts to revive him but no way.

0:00:36.520,0:00:40.160
Open your lips and pray for God's intervention.

0:00:40.160,0:00:41.820
A sudden death.

0:00:41.820,0:00:45.680
They will try to revive in whatever way.

0:00:45.680,0:00:47.660
So, you just pray.

0:00:47.660,0:00:48.900
Let the will of God be done.
