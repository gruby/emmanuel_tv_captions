CHANGING LIVES

0:00:03.640,0:00:10.780
Emanuel! God is with us! Viewers around the world, welcome to today's episode of changing lives.

0:00:10.780,0:00:12.280
My name is Chris.

0:00:12.280,0:00:14.000
My name is Olamide.

0:00:14.000,0:00:20.660
This is the programme where we personally encounter those who have personally encountered

0:00:20.660,0:00:26.720
Jesus Christ in a special way through the ministry that God has given to Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:26.720,0:00:31.780
Yes, Chris. Today, we live in a world where many view life as fun and games.

0:00:31.780,0:00:34.840
They pursue pleasure at the price of peace

0:00:34.840,0:00:39.160
but always end up being left with a sense of dissatisfaction in life.

0:00:39.160,0:00:41.580
That's very true, Olamide.

0:00:41.580,0:00:45.980
By the grace of God, the life experience of the couple that we have with us here today

0:00:45.980,0:00:53.200
on changing lives is a very poignant reminder that life is indeed not fun and games.

0:00:53.200,0:01:00.020
In fact, viewers, it is a warfare where only the serious-minded are victorious.

0:01:00.020,0:01:05.760
Yes, indeed. Little did our guests know that life did not just happen to him.

0:01:05.760,0:01:10.960
It's all about choices and how he responded to every situation.

0:01:10.960,0:01:18.320
Before his success came, he made many wrong choices in the past that almost crippled his marriage,

0:01:18.320,0:01:24.300
his professional life but when he connected to the anointing that breaks the yoke

0:01:24.300,0:01:28.660
here at The SCOAN, that was when he rediscovered his roots

0:01:28.660,0:01:34.940
and began to walk into his divine destiny - both personally and professionally.

0:01:34.940,0:01:41.880
Today we have the pleasure of speaking with one of Nigeria's most celebrated film critic and scholar.

0:01:41.880,0:01:49.900
He is a publisher, an author and also a PhD holder from the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.

0:01:49.900,0:01:57.400
He is also the sitting dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Port Harcourt, River State, Nigeria.

0:01:57.400,0:02:00.920
He is also a member of the university's governing council.

0:02:00.920,0:02:05.760
You're welcome to this programme, Prof. Femi Shaka and his wife.

0:02:05.760,0:02:08.600
Thank you for joining us on this programme.

0:02:08.600,0:02:10.160
- It's been a pleasure.
- You're welcome.

0:02:10.160,0:02:14.060
Tell us more about yourself and tell us the reason why you're here on the programme today.

0:02:14.060,0:02:17.760
I am Professor Femi Okiremuete Shaka.

0:02:17.760,0:02:25.920
I studied at the universities of Benin, Ibadan in Nigeria, and then proceeded to the United Kingdom

0:02:25.920,0:02:33.500
on commonwealth scholarship to take a PhD in film studies at the University of Warwick, Coventry.

0:02:33.500,0:02:43.820
Thereafter, I returned to Nigeria in 1995 to take up an appointment at the University of Port Harcourt.

0:02:43.820,0:02:53.540
But the story is a little bit full of disappointment, near success situations and so on and so forth.

0:02:53.540,0:02:58.940
Returning from the UK with a PhD in film studies, which was very rare at the time I got it,

0:02:58.940,0:03:04.540
I expected that the university would grab me and be very happy to have somebody

0:03:04.540,0:03:07.360
in a new discipline in the country.

0:03:07.360,0:03:12.480
But my employment was delayed for one full year, and I couldn't understand it.

0:03:12.480,0:03:16.960
It was as if all the expectations I had in coming back...

0:03:16.960,0:03:21.000
I had the opportunity of going to Canada, Australia or the US

0:03:21.000,0:03:23.900
but I decided to come home to pass on the knowledge.

0:03:23.900,0:03:29.560
So you can imagine the feeling of disappointment I had when my employment was delayed.

0:03:29.560,0:03:39.560
Since then, I've been having a lot of delays in life expectations.

0:03:39.560,0:03:43.640
About 1995 or thereabout, I met my wife.

0:03:43.640,0:03:48.060
She was doing a programme then at the university.

0:03:48.060,0:03:53.860
I had just returned. We met, dated for a couple of years and then got married.

0:03:53.860,0:04:01.540
In 2001, the year of 9/11, I got a Fulbright scholarship to go back to the US.

0:04:01.540,0:04:07.440
I taught and carried out research at the New York University -

0:04:07.440,0:04:10.840
African and African-American studies programme.

0:04:10.840,0:04:18.180
I was there for one year, and it was during that tenure there that I wrote my book on African cinema.

0:04:18.180,0:04:25.680
When I returned, I got really distracted.

0:04:25.680,0:04:31.120
First I got elected into the senior staff club of the university.

0:04:31.120,0:04:38.060
University in Nigeria are almost a small community of their own.

0:04:38.060,0:04:47.260
Most of them have staff quarters, health centres, primary school for the children of staff,

0:04:47.260,0:04:50.920
nursery and high school.

0:04:50.920,0:04:58.180
The high school is like a teaching laboratory for students specialising in education.

0:04:58.180,0:05:04.580
So I got elected into the staff club and that is where my life started going down the drain

0:05:04.580,0:05:09.600
because I then started indulging and drinking.

0:05:09.600,0:05:15.640
Most of the time I used to boast to my friends that my movement was triangular.

0:05:15.640,0:05:19.960
If you didn't find me in the house, I had gone for lectures.

0:05:19.960,0:05:24.080
Then there were two places you could get me - if I was not in the lecture room,

0:05:24.080,0:05:29.600
I would be in the staff club, and if I was not in the staff club, I would be in the house.

0:05:29.600,0:05:33.620
I spent most of the time in the staff club drinking with my friends,

0:05:33.620,0:05:35.520
arguing over nothing.

0:05:35.520,0:05:42.320
And you can imagine that when you've taken a long drink and you're high,

0:05:42.320,0:05:50.040
when you see all your friends phoning their girlfriends, telling them to come over

0:05:50.040,0:05:56.240
to join them at the staff club, you are tempted to join them and I did join them.

0:05:56.240,0:05:58.760
Very soon, I became an expert.

0:05:58.760,0:06:05.120
Whenever you are traveling for external examination, you would talk about, "Oh boy. Are you carrying a handbag?"

0:06:05.120,0:06:15.140
I mean, such kind of misogynistic expressions.

0:06:15.140,0:06:21.720
The grace of God was upon my work because I noticed that each time I went out on these exploits,

0:06:21.720,0:06:23.460
she would usually catch me.

0:06:23.460,0:06:28.820
When you say that you were carrying a handbag, you need to explain it a bit.

0:06:28.820,0:06:30.140
It is a girlfirend.

0:06:30.140,0:06:32.800
It refers to a girlfriend - handbag.

0:06:32.800,0:06:36.580
When you are travelling, you are supposed to carry a handbag.

0:06:36.580,0:06:45.060
Men don't carry handbags which tells you the derogatory language we used for our women.

0:06:45.060,0:06:52.540
From my own personal experience, it was something that was destroying me and my career.

0:06:52.540,0:06:59.000
Rather than really publishing and getting celebrated, I was going down

0:06:59.000,0:07:03.780
because I was spending more time in the staff club than at my desk as a researcher,.

0:07:03.780,0:07:11.440
I should have been spending more time burning the midnight oil and reading and publishing papers.

0:07:11.440,0:07:19.140
That was when my promotion got delayed again for about eight years, even though I was well published.

0:07:19.140,0:07:26.120
I'm sorry to cut in - could you just tell us of the scale and scope of the kind of alcohol you were taking,

0:07:26.120,0:07:28.160
as a result of this lifestyle.

0:07:28.160,0:07:30.440
It was much.

0:07:30.440,0:07:34.680
We used to boast.

0:07:34.680,0:07:40.960
I would say, "Get me an electric pole". An electric pole is like a big bottle of stout, and then you mix it with coke.

0:07:40.960,0:07:43.620
You can take about four of that.

0:07:43.620,0:07:48.540
You would have just finished from the lecture hall and come to the club. You had not eaten.

0:07:48.540,0:07:55.440
So most of the time, you were high and lost track of things.

0:07:55.440,0:08:00.940
You would not be thinking straight as you should as a scholar,

0:08:00.940,0:08:10.840
and you weren't really paying more attention to your studies and teaching.

0:08:10.840,0:08:15.620
Your teaching is based on the experiences you have picked up.

0:08:15.620,0:08:18.940
You are supposed to do a lot of research before you go to the classroom to teach.

0:08:18.940,0:08:24.520
I was a stickler for time and everything but even at my own level of education

0:08:24.520,0:08:28.180
I could feel that I wasn't doing what I ought to do.

0:08:28.180,0:08:34.160
I mean, by the kind of instruction I was put through in the UK, I knew I wasn't giving my best,

0:08:34.160,0:08:39.380
even though among my colleagues, I was celebrated as one of the best lecturers in my department.

0:08:39.380,0:08:45.080
I even won some awards - three or four years as the best teacher in the department.

0:08:45.080,0:08:50.340
But I knew within me that I could do better than what I was doing.

0:08:50.340,0:08:56.660
So my kids were not really seeing me. I was an absentee father.

0:08:56.660,0:08:59.460
Whenever they called me and said, "Daddy, there's homework",

0:08:59.460,0:09:02.960
I would say, "Please give it to your mom or to the lesson teacher!"

0:09:02.960,0:09:08.200
I would just storm out and the house was very hot for me.

0:09:08.200,0:09:13.100
I just couldn't understand why I couldn't feel comfortable in my house - the house was just hot.

0:09:13.100,0:09:19.560
I just had to get out. When I was driving to the staff club, that is when I would feel free, happy and relaxed.

0:09:19.560,0:09:22.280
But it wasn't the best of life.

0:09:22.280,0:09:26.860
My promotion, like I said, was delayed by eight years.

0:09:26.860,0:09:33.520
It gave me some time to think over my life,

0:09:33.520,0:09:38.380
"What is happening to me? Where am I? I mean, I have a Christian upbringing.

0:09:38.380,0:09:40.320
So what is happening to me?"

0:09:40.320,0:09:42.520
Sorry to cut you short.

0:09:42.520,0:09:49.520
During this time were your students and fellow lecturers aware of your activities outside the university?

0:09:49.520,0:09:52.380
No way! They weren't aware.

0:09:52.380,0:09:58.180
I was living a secret life - a very secret life.

0:09:58.180,0:10:03.620
Most of the time I thought I was deceiving my wife but the grace of God was upon her.

0:10:03.620,0:10:07.020
Like I said, she would always catch me in the act.

0:10:07.020,0:10:16.560
One time I asked her, "Is anybody telling you what I'm doing

0:10:16.560,0:10:20.440
or how come you are always catching me when I go out?"

0:10:20.440,0:10:32.300
She would say, "Look. Unless you come out of your escapades, sinful life -

0:10:32.300,0:10:42.880
the Lord will clean you up first before you will start to see your life, visions

0:10:42.880,0:10:44.960
the way they are supposed to come".

0:10:44.960,0:10:47.280
I would laugh over it.

0:10:47.280,0:10:51.720
My sister-in-law came to the house.

0:10:51.720,0:10:57.260
I was always very moody because my promotion had been delayed.

0:10:57.260,0:11:03.460
Many people whom I felt were not well published as I was were getting promoted.

0:11:03.460,0:11:08.860
I was complaining and she asked whether we had heard about Emmanuel TV.

0:11:08.860,0:11:12.720
Sorry to cut you again, sir. Before you talk about discovering Emmanuel TV,

0:11:12.720,0:11:17.420
we still want our viewers to really learn from what you're talking about - your experience with this lifestyle.

0:11:17.420,0:11:24.340
Did you at any time consider the risks or the repercussions of such a lifestyle?

0:11:24.340,0:11:30.000
Of course no!

0:11:30.000,0:11:36.280
Anybody who is into smoking or is into a particular lifestyle

0:11:36.280,0:11:40.460
does not really see that there are repercussions.

0:11:40.460,0:11:44.200
I mean I could have contracted a disease and passed it on to my wife.

0:11:44.200,0:11:47.920
Both of us could have died. What about the kids that we brought into the world?

0:11:47.920,0:11:51.760
I didn't really give any thought to that.

0:11:51.760,0:11:56.100
As far as I was concerned, I was seeking pleasure and I was getting plenty of it.

0:11:56.100,0:12:04.460
A university like ours - because I was also dedicated to my duty in a way, compared to other lecturers.

0:12:04.460,0:12:08.800
Girls were around; they were always coming around.

0:12:08.800,0:12:19.360
There was a lot of temptation in getting really sunk into that kind of whirlpool of sinfulness

0:12:19.360,0:12:23.560
Something that I can say - only the good Lord pulled me out of it

0:12:23.560,0:12:33.300
because I mean, how do you live a life where you are a stranger before your kids?

0:12:33.300,0:12:37.820
Each time you come, it is as if everybody starts hiding

0:12:37.820,0:12:42.860
and talks like, "Daddy has come back!" They would start shouting that.

0:12:42.860,0:12:45.760
I would start shouting, asking for my food.

0:12:45.760,0:12:50.440
If my food did not come quickl, I would go up straight to my bed.

0:12:50.440,0:12:54.440
I knew I was hurting my wife but I was helpless

0:12:54.440,0:12:59.440
because there was a spirit driving me that I couldn't control and contain.

0:12:59.440,0:13:03.300
So maybe we can see you actually in a world of your own.

0:13:03.300,0:13:08.160
Yes, and many of my colleagues are living the same kind of life.

0:13:08.160,0:13:11.460
Many of them are still into it, even as I'm speaking now.

0:13:11.460,0:13:17.980
Many of them are in the club drinking, shouting and arguing over nonsense.

0:13:17.980,0:13:21.240
Their families are lonely.

0:13:21.240,0:13:28.700
Their wife and children really deserve to have their father in the home.

0:13:28.700,0:13:30.820
I was absent.

0:13:30.820,0:13:32.560
Thank You, Father.

0:13:32.560,0:13:39.100
So then what you thought you were doing to create pleasure for yourself,

0:13:39.100,0:13:44.200
can we say that it actually satisfied you or you felt fulfilled during that time?

0:13:44.200,0:13:51.100
No, I was empty and looking for more of it!

0:13:51.100,0:13:55.520
There was a time before I travelled to the US, we would boast,

0:13:55.520,0:13:58.720
"Oh boy, which one?" - "Number two has gone!"

0:13:58.720,0:14:00.860
Only for God's sake.

0:14:00.860,0:14:04.040
God loved me. If not, by now I'm sure I would have been dead.

0:14:04.040,0:14:09.340
For the abuse I gave to myself.

0:14:09.340,0:14:11.120
Thinking back now, I was really self-centred.

0:14:11.120,0:14:15.280
I never really gave a thought to my wife about what I was doing.

0:14:15.280,0:14:20.500
It was really a very bad life.

0:14:20.500,0:14:23.240
I'd like to ask your wife a question at this point.

0:14:23.240,0:14:27.900
Your husband said you caught him many times, even red-handed.

0:14:27.900,0:14:30.200
In fact, almost all the time.

0:14:30.200,0:14:34.800
Did you ever consider leaving him when you caught him in such a scenario?

0:14:34.800,0:14:35.840
No.

0:14:35.840,0:14:37.300
Why? What strengthened you?

0:14:37.300,0:14:41.100
My own brain game because I attended a seminary school,

0:14:41.100,0:14:44.480
and it really helped me knowing the Lord.

0:14:44.480,0:14:50.860
And I knew when we came together, I had to pray because of the challenges in the marriage.

0:14:50.860,0:14:54.400
He is from Orugu, I'm from Igbo.

0:14:54.400,0:14:58.580
You hardly see a Yoruba man, being the first son, marrying outside.

0:14:58.580,0:15:03.240
So there were a lot of challenges before we came together.

0:15:03.240,0:15:11.680
Sometimes my friends would say, "Won't you leave him? Orugu people will kill you!"

0:15:11.680,0:15:13.240
Yes.

0:15:13.240,0:15:16.020
Then I started putting it into prayer.

0:15:16.020,0:15:17.800
And I then noticed...

0:15:17.800,0:15:23.860
Even during that period, in year 1, I had it very hot with the family.

0:15:23.860,0:15:26.240
It wasn't an easy journey.

0:15:26.240,0:15:32.380
At the time, instead of going for my lectures, we were together, we were like friends.

0:15:32.380,0:15:37.340
Like he rightly said, we courted for some time.

0:15:37.340,0:15:45.440
So I started going to church, trying to seek the face of the Lord.

0:15:45.440,0:15:51.740
In fact, instead of going to lectures, when there were challenges, I would go to church.

0:15:51.740,0:16:04.020
Sometimes this apostolic - you would follow the congregation and then a message would come,

0:16:04.020,0:16:06.780
"You're crying, what did you do?

0:16:06.780,0:16:11.240
God said you didn't do anything. He will fight the battle".

0:16:11.240,0:16:19.040
In fact, all these messages that were coming made me to stay put.

0:16:19.040,0:16:21.780
So all the challenges - it wasn't an easy journey.

0:16:21.780,0:16:25.920
If you don't know the Lord, you will collapse. Yes.

0:16:25.920,0:16:32.240
So when we started, he was really a nice person - at that early time.

0:16:32.240,0:16:34.240
When I just came back from the UK.

0:16:34.240,0:16:37.680
Very nice.

0:16:37.680,0:16:42.380
So at the time, when we got married, the house was very hot.

0:16:42.380,0:16:44.020
I said, "What is going on?"

0:16:44.020,0:16:49.820
Each time he went clubbing; when he came back to the house, it was just to have his bath and then off again.

0:16:49.820,0:16:51.160
He changed and then off again.

0:16:51.160,0:16:53.100
I asked, "Won't you eat?" He said, "No, no!"

0:16:53.100,0:16:58.200
By the time he came back, maybe around nine or ten, he would say, "Where is my food?"

0:16:58.200,0:17:01.980
Or sometimes there would be food on the dining table, he would say, "No, no!"

0:17:01.980,0:17:05.280
I would say, "You see what you are doing to yourself", and he would go upstairs.

0:17:05.280,0:17:11.760
Even in the marriage, I lost two kids.

0:17:11.760,0:17:17.400
I lost the first one, the second one was dead, and I lost the third one.

0:17:17.400,0:17:23.460
When I was pregnant for the fourth one, I remember one experience - a very sad experience.

0:17:23.460,0:17:28.980
He was going out in the morning. He came because I saw him with a lady.

0:17:28.980,0:17:31.940
In the morning I said, "Who was that person?"

0:17:31.940,0:17:33.840
He said, "Must I know everybody?"

0:17:33.840,0:17:36.100
I said, "You are not going anywhere".

0:17:36.100,0:17:41.140
So when I said you're not going anywhere, he pushed me with the pregnancy.

0:17:41.140,0:17:43.160
I fell.

0:17:43.160,0:17:46.000
So when I fell, I stood up.

0:17:46.000,0:17:52.220
He said, "I will go and report you to your parents, if you want somebody that will kill you".

0:17:52.220,0:17:55.440
I'm sure you are feeling bad.

0:17:55.440,0:18:01.200
He said, "If you want somebody that will kill his mommy, go to your parents and die there".

0:18:01.200,0:18:02.940
I left him.

0:18:02.940,0:18:10.420
So when I left him, my spirit said - because before then, each time I complained to his mother,

0:18:10.420,0:18:13.900
since they didn't like me then - that was then -

0:18:13.900,0:18:16.080
so each time I complained, they would say, "Ehe".

0:18:16.080,0:18:29.460
His mum told me one day, "My husband married three - from polygamous home. I didn't kill him.

0:18:29.460,0:18:35.720
So you will not kill my son because of women. If you don't want to stay, go!"

0:18:35.720,0:18:39.140
So because of that, I now stopped complaining.

0:18:39.140,0:18:43.100
So when he did that to me, when he pushed me, I told myself...

0:18:43.100,0:18:46.840
All these things that had been happening, I refused to tell my own people

0:18:46.840,0:18:51.440
because I knew they loved him. I didn't want them to hate him -

0:18:51.440,0:18:54.740
for them to feel that he was treating me badly.

0:18:54.740,0:18:58.560
I was keeping it all to myself, praying.

0:18:58.560,0:19:03.140
So when he pushed me, one spirit said, "Don't push him, leave him!

0:19:03.140,0:19:06.680
Just focus on God. God will change him

0:19:06.680,0:19:10.980
If you continue like this, you will get yourself hurt. You'll be hurting yourself.

0:19:10.980,0:19:15.340
Leave him. The battle is not yours; it is the Lord's".

0:19:15.340,0:19:20.500
The Spirit of God kept talking inside of me.

0:19:20.500,0:19:24.080
Each time the Spirit of God talked to me, I would relax.

0:19:24.080,0:19:29.320
So that day when he came back, I was lying down on the floor in the sitting room.

0:19:29.320,0:19:34.080
He left that morning and came back around 6:00.

0:19:34.080,0:19:39.760
I was expecting him to say like, "Are you okay?" He didn't talk to me. He just walked on.

0:19:39.760,0:19:44.380
Each time I would be the one to meet him to say, "It's okay"

0:19:44.380,0:19:49.100
because I knew he was ever ready to dump me to move ahead with his life.

0:19:49.100,0:19:51.320
So it would be me to break the silence.

0:19:51.320,0:19:56.100
And you cannot continue this way because anything that will bring enmity will go to God.

0:19:56.100,0:19:58.720
God will not hear you.

0:19:58.720,0:20:05.740
Each time I would still be the one going to him, saying, "Okay. That one has past. It is okay".

0:20:05.740,0:20:07.600
I would waive it.

0:20:07.600,0:20:09.860
So we continued like that.

0:20:09.860,0:20:13.580
There were instances - they were too many.

0:20:13.580,0:20:18.860
There was one time, during one of the periods that I lost a baby, pregnancy was not coming.

0:20:18.860,0:20:21.420
I stayed up to five years (without getting pregnant).

0:20:21.420,0:20:23.740
Pregnancy was not coming.

0:20:23.740,0:20:27.400
I had just lost that baby like a month.

0:20:27.400,0:20:31.800
I went to my doctor at Aba - from Port Harcourt to Aba.

0:20:31.800,0:20:35.000
That morning he dressed up. He was going to the presidential palace to give a talk.

0:20:35.000,0:20:37.420
I said, "You are looking good". He said, "Thank you".

0:20:37.420,0:20:40.880
When I left, he gave me money to go and see my doctor.

0:20:40.880,0:20:44.940
I came back in the evening around 4:00.

0:20:44.940,0:20:48.500
From the taxi I was in, I saw him.

0:20:48.500,0:20:50.680
They drove past.

0:20:50.680,0:20:53.300
The girl was sitting this way, facing him.

0:20:53.300,0:20:55.600
In my mind I said, "What is this.

0:20:55.600,0:21:00.600
Look at you now. You've come to look at him enjoying himself. It is well".

0:21:00.600,0:21:02.300
So I went home.

0:21:02.300,0:21:06.980
As I was there, one of my friends came that her husband was doing the same thing.

0:21:06.980,0:21:11.920
She just came to me and said, "Mrs Shaka, when my husband comes, today A.

0:21:11.920,0:21:14.300
In fact, today, we will fight".

0:21:14.300,0:21:15.680
I said, "Fight? Why?"

0:21:15.680,0:21:17.580
She said, "This man - carrying women!"

0:21:17.580,0:21:18.520
I said, "Hmm".

0:21:18.520,0:21:24.080
So we were discussing and I was counselling her, "Leave it! Pray for him!"

0:21:24.080,0:21:28.320
As we were talking, I told her about the one I had seen that very day.

0:21:28.320,0:21:32.260
"I went to Aba for treatment. I saw him coming.

0:21:32.260,0:21:36.380
He went to the presidential palace, and I saw him when he was coming back".

0:21:36.380,0:21:39.820
She said, "What is with all these men?" We laughed.

0:21:39.820,0:21:43.480
We were discussing when my husband came.

0:21:43.480,0:21:47.520
He parked his car in the garage and then entered.

0:21:47.520,0:21:50.520
I said, "Honey, welcome".

0:21:50.520,0:21:53.400
He said, "Thank you".

0:21:53.400,0:21:58.160
I said, "You stayed long. Is it that since this morning, you just finished?"

0:21:58.160,0:22:00.540
He said, "Yes". That was around 7:00.

0:22:00.540,0:22:02.260
He said, "Yes, we just closed now".

0:22:02.260,0:22:07.360
So the lady looked at my face. I looked at her as soon as he went upstairs.

0:22:07.360,0:22:12.520
She said, "Wow. You are doing well. You mean since 4 o'clock that you saw him?"

0:22:12.520,0:22:16.440
I said, "Yes. Now he will go and arrange himself".

0:22:16.440,0:22:20.060
She said, "If it were me, as he entered, I would grab him".

0:22:20.060,0:22:23.880
I said, "No, you don't need to do that".

0:22:23.880,0:22:28.440
So it was that very night that I caught him again.

0:22:28.440,0:22:31.200
I said, "This thing you are doing, is it good?

0:22:31.200,0:22:37.180
This morning, you gave me money to go and see my doctor.

0:22:37.180,0:22:41.140
As I was coming back - look at me going - we have only one son.

0:22:41.140,0:22:44.440
Look at me going, pursuing the fruit of the womb.

0:22:44.440,0:22:48.620
Look at you. Look at what you are doing with women. Is it good?

0:22:48.620,0:22:51.440
If it is good before God, it is good before me.

0:22:51.440,0:22:55.400
But if it is not good before God, okay, let Him fight the battle.

0:22:55.400,0:22:57.020
Stop doing this thing".

0:22:57.020,0:22:59.700
Wow. We really salute your patience. We really do.

0:22:59.700,0:23:03.960
Indeed, you felt relaxed. It is all to the glory of God.

0:23:03.960,0:23:09.440
Whenever I talked to him that way - you wouldn't see me shouting.

0:23:09.440,0:23:12.900
The Spirit of God said, "Don't shout. It is not your battle.

0:23:12.900,0:23:17.080
Continue talking to him. I will fight it for you".

0:23:17.080,0:23:21.720
Each time I would talk to him gently, nicely.

0:23:21.720,0:23:23.720
I would say, "It is not good".

0:23:23.720,0:23:26.920
He would be sober.

0:23:26.920,0:23:28.500
He would say, "I'm sorry".

0:23:28.500,0:23:30.280
I would say, "It's okay. Bring your hand".

0:23:30.280,0:23:33.100
I would hold his hand and pray for him.

0:23:33.100,0:23:37.400
I would say, "Stop doing these things. Let us see where God will take us".

0:23:37.400,0:23:39.400
He would say, "Okay".

0:23:39.400,0:23:43.120
After that "okay", he would leave that particular one.

0:23:43.120,0:23:46.320
Anyone I discovered, he would leave that one.

0:23:46.320,0:23:48.720
And go to another one.

0:23:48.720,0:23:51.500
I realised that when I got that one, he would leave that one.

0:23:51.500,0:23:57.140
I would tell him, "You drive this one away and then jump here to this one".

0:23:57.140,0:23:59.240
I would be teasing him with it.

0:23:59.240,0:24:03.640
Sometimes too, instead of quarrelling when he got home...

0:24:03.640,0:24:12.080
Sometimes, when he saw that I had caught him, I would call him and say, "Where are you?"

0:24:12.080,0:24:16.860
He would say, "I'm going to the club." Then I would say, "I'm coming to the club too to drink".

0:24:16.860,0:24:20.000
He would then say, "No, no. I'm not in the club. My car got spoiled".

0:24:20.000,0:24:25.520
I would say, "You see your life! You cannot hide it from God!"

0:24:25.520,0:24:27.860
I would sing that song.

0:24:27.860,0:24:34.140
When he came back, I would say, "You see yourself? All these girls!

0:24:34.140,0:24:38.280
The day I will catch them, I will squeeze their heads".

0:24:38.280,0:24:40.280
He would say, "Don't mind them - all these stupid girls!

0:24:40.280,0:24:45.780
So I now turned it to a game so that I would not hurt myself.

0:24:45.780,0:24:48.300
He would say, "Mummy, don't worry - all these girls".

0:24:48.300,0:24:50.560
It is exactly what your husband was saying earlier.

0:24:50.560,0:24:53.640
It was a spirit behind it.

0:24:53.640,0:24:56.100
I knew that it was a spirit.

0:24:56.100,0:25:03.000
That was why I noticed that my rate of progress was going down.

0:25:03.000,0:25:07.540
I was not living up to expectations.

0:25:07.540,0:25:12.640
I was supposed to be a high flyer but I was not making progress.

0:25:12.640,0:25:17.320
My sister-in-law noticed it also because she came to the house.

0:25:17.320,0:25:23.480
Most of the time, they loved me - my in-laws.

0:25:23.480,0:25:27.860
Instead of calling me by name, they were calling me "Unlce Femi". They were very fond of me.

0:25:27.860,0:25:31.500
She was asking me, "What is wrong? Why is your promotion so delayed?"

0:25:31.500,0:25:33.100
I said, "I don't know.

0:25:33.100,0:25:38.740
She then asked, "Are you aware of Emmanuel TV?"

0:25:38.740,0:25:41.140
I said, "No".

0:25:41.140,0:25:47.420
She then said, "You need to install it in the house and be watching it".

0:25:47.420,0:25:52.380
That is one of the things that I most credit my wife with: She is very determined.

0:25:52.380,0:25:55.580
Shortly after that, she installed Emmanuel TV.

0:25:55.580,0:26:00.980
We started watching it, keenly.

0:26:00.980,0:26:06.120
We saw the wonderful things that God was using His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:26:06.120,0:26:08.960
to achieve amongst His people.

0:26:08.960,0:26:16.500
Like I have said, because I come from a Christian family background,

0:26:16.500,0:26:22.880
I saw immediately that I needed to seek spiritual direction.

0:26:22.880,0:26:25.980
I knew that there was something pushing me.

0:26:25.980,0:26:32.680
It was like someone smoking - the more the person promises he is going to stop smoking,

0:26:32.680,0:26:36.560
the more the spirit of smoking would take hold of the person.

0:26:36.560,0:26:38.940
This was the kind of thing I was going through.

0:26:38.940,0:26:42.520
We watched Emmanuel TV in our house for nearly one year

0:26:42.520,0:26:47.940
before I ventured to travel to The SCOAN.

0:26:47.940,0:26:55.040
When I came, I had the opportunity of getting the Morning Water.

0:26:55.040,0:26:57.900
I went back home with it.

0:26:57.900,0:26:59.060
We would say a prayer,

0:26:59.060,0:27:03.680
and at the end of the prayer, I would administer the Morning Water on each member of the family.

0:27:03.680,0:27:09.840
When it reached my turn, I would confess all my sins - before my family, my mother-in-law.

0:27:09.840,0:27:18.480
That I  was a fornicator, drunkard, that I was not doing my family duties,

0:27:18.480,0:27:23.160
that I wasn't a good father to my children. I had to confess all my sins.

0:27:23.160,0:27:26.140
My mother-in-law was laughing at me, "You are funny!"

0:27:26.140,0:27:29.380
I said, "I'm not funny because I must put this devil to shame!"

0:27:29.380,0:27:30.680
So to discrace this spirit?

0:27:30.680,0:27:32.080
Yes!

0:27:32.080,0:27:36.660
Each night he would pray, "God of T.B. Joshua, help me!

0:27:36.660,0:27:46.440
Every spirit of fornication and adultery, not being faithful to my dear wife, every spirit - out!"

0:27:46.440,0:27:51.140
All these things you were hiding came out.

0:27:51.160,0:27:56.900
The way he shouted, all of us would say, "That spirit - out, in the name of Jesus!"

0:27:56.900,0:28:00.860
You were doing mass prayer in your house!

0:28:00.860,0:28:08.100
Very shortly after that, after about two months - I kept on praying

0:28:08.100,0:28:10.840
but I did not notice that I had not been going to the club.

0:28:10.840,0:28:12.020
Just like that.

0:28:12.020,0:28:15.740
It kept on going like this for three months. Then people started calling me, "What is happening?

0:28:15.740,0:28:17.540
We don't see you at the club nowadays!"

0:28:17.540,0:28:22.100
I said, "It is because of work!"

0:28:22.100,0:28:24.300
This went on for six months.

0:28:24.300,0:28:27.540
Then it became clear that something was really happening.

0:28:27.540,0:28:36.280
Then I started not to feel the urge for going to the club, taking alcohol.

0:28:36.280,0:28:38.300
It just stopped.

0:28:38.300,0:28:40.080
The urge just left.

0:28:40.080,0:28:45.660
My former girlfriends lined up - they would call and call.

0:28:45.660,0:28:50.500
I'm sure they are watching now. You see? I'm born-again!

0:28:50.500,0:28:52.500
I'm delivered.

0:28:52.500,0:28:55.540
They kept calling and calling.

0:28:55.540,0:29:00.240
I sent most of them text messages, "Please, I'm born-again!"

0:29:00.240,0:29:03.440
Most of them didn't believe it because I was really bad.

0:29:03.440,0:29:05.280
I was living a bad life.

0:29:05.280,0:29:07.800
It went on like that.

0:29:07.800,0:29:10.200
They noticed that when the second examiner came,

0:29:10.200,0:29:16.640
I would take the person down to the club to buy them a drink - we would take maltina.

0:29:16.640,0:29:21.840
That was still initially. After that, I never went again to the club, at all.

0:29:21.840,0:29:27.880
It was February last year that I celebrated my wife.

0:29:27.880,0:29:31.700
I said, "Do you know that this is the first time since I married you that I can really say

0:29:31.700,0:29:38.500
that I'm celebrating Valentine's day without having seen another woman for one year".

0:29:38.500,0:29:42.920
And I said, "Wow, God is great!"

0:29:42.920,0:29:49.640
Since then, I have been having a peaceful home - a settled home.

0:29:49.640,0:29:59.940
I'm at peace with myself and I keep asking myself, "What the hell was I doing in the club?"

0:29:59.940,0:30:08.760
About January - Febuary last year, a group of young men in the faculty came to me and said,

0:30:08.760,0:30:11.180
"Prof, you have to be our next dean".

0:30:11.180,0:30:12.700
I said, "Me?"

0:30:12.700,0:30:14.040
So they laughed.

0:30:14.040,0:30:17.740
Before I knew it, they went and picked forms, filled forms, printed posters.

0:30:17.740,0:30:20.460
This happened on my behalf.

0:30:20.460,0:30:23.200
I couldn't help but joining them.

0:30:23.200,0:30:25.820
He didn't pay a dime.

0:30:25.820,0:30:30.840
They paid the money. They said, "You must be our next dean!"

0:30:30.840,0:30:36.740
In fairness, they knew that I was always very fair and firm on any issue.

0:30:36.740,0:30:41.880
I never really liked people that suppressed younger colleagues for no reason.

0:30:41.880,0:30:44.260
So they were determined that I should be the next dean.

0:30:44.260,0:30:49.940
But I knew that I was also a minority.

0:30:49.940,0:30:55.260
To tell you that God of T.B. Joshua was really involved in my affairs, has taken hold of my affairs,

0:30:55.260,0:31:00.280
after separating me from the club, drunkenness, womanising and everything,

0:31:00.280,0:31:03.140
I was now ready to go.

0:31:03.140,0:31:05.020
We went into the election.

0:31:05.020,0:31:12.900
On the very day of the election, the godfather - the one they referred to as godfather -

0:31:12.900,0:31:17.940
he called the two River State indigenous candidates who were contesting against me.

0:31:17.940,0:31:19.940
He said, "One of them should step down".

0:31:19.940,0:31:24.220
Of course they refused, which meant that their vote was split.

0:31:24.220,0:31:33.920
And that gave me the honour, by the grace of God of T.B. Joshua, to win the election by just one vote.

0:31:33.920,0:31:35.380
Just one vote.

0:31:35.380,0:31:44.880
I think I got about 156, and the second person 155.

0:31:44.880,0:31:47.360
It wasn't the senate one.

0:31:47.360,0:31:48.100
Ok.

0:31:48.100,0:31:52.800
The first person got 46; the second person 59.

0:31:52.800,0:31:55.700
And you got 60.

0:31:55.700,0:31:57.520
Wow.

0:31:57.520,0:31:58.900
So that's it.

0:31:58.900,0:32:03.240
That's how I won that election, and I knew that the hand of God was upon my life.

0:32:03.240,0:32:07.000
That same year, we had...

0:32:07.000,0:32:13.520
Before that - during the campaigning for that election, he didn't go to the club.

0:32:13.520,0:32:19.420
It was a year after the transformation.

0:32:19.420,0:32:25.700
When they came, the people campaigning for them would ask them in the club,

0:32:25.700,0:32:29.540
"The person you are campaigning for is not coming? You are the one doing it".

0:32:29.540,0:32:34.520
Each time they came to the house, I would tell the campaign manager -

0:32:34.520,0:32:37.360
he would call me, "Are you praying?" and I would say, "Yes.

0:32:37.360,0:32:42.660
But there is one thing I want to tell you: A builder builds in vain without God,

0:32:42.660,0:32:46.380
A watchman watches in vain without God.

0:32:46.380,0:32:49.340
So you campaign in vain without God.

0:32:49.340,0:32:52.420
So as you are campaigning, make sure you involve God".

0:32:52.420,0:32:54.640
Wow. And truly God was involved!

0:32:54.640,0:32:57.720
So the breakthrough you were looking for, for many years, was coming!

0:32:57.720,0:33:04.200
And after I won that election, I received NUC accreditation.

0:33:04.200,0:33:09.080
The Nigerian University Commission is the federal government agency

0:33:09.080,0:33:14.420
that is in charge of regulating programmes in Nigerian universities.

0:33:14.420,0:33:19.840
If your programme is not approved, accredited, you cannot teach that course.

0:33:19.840,0:33:26.300
So I had eight departments that were undergoing NUC accreditation.

0:33:26.300,0:33:29.400
My faculty is made up of nine departments.

0:33:29.400,0:33:32.380
One was already accredited. So I had eight departments (undergoing accreditation).

0:33:32.380,0:33:36.480
We were living in a rickety facult building.

0:33:36.480,0:33:42.280
We had a new, uncompleted faculty building that was in the bush.

0:33:42.280,0:33:45.680
When I told them that I was going to move into that faculty building,

0:33:45.680,0:33:50.120
those guys laughed and said, "How can you say that we should move into this forest?

0:33:50.120,0:33:51.600
That is not possible!"

0:33:51.600,0:33:54.360
I went to meet the Vice Chancellor.

0:33:54.360,0:34:00.220
Luckily, he saw my vision and said, "The money we were going to give to you, we will split it in two.

0:34:00.220,0:34:04.040
We will give half to the contractor to complete the building, and you can move into it.

0:34:04.040,0:34:07.000
That was exactly what happened.

0:34:07.000,0:34:13.400
Even when he won that election - each time we prayed with the Morning Water -

0:34:13.400,0:34:20.900
because he went in with two points that he would move them to the faculty building

0:34:20.900,0:34:24.100
and he would give them full accreditation.

0:34:24.100,0:34:28.320
Other people campaigned with calumny. I told him, "Don't campaign against anybody.

0:34:28.320,0:34:30.500
Just tell them what you want to do for them".

0:34:30.500,0:34:35.300
I was telling the campaign manager, "Just tell them what you want to do for them.

0:34:35.300,0:34:38.400
Don't campaign against anybody".

0:34:38.400,0:34:44.420
When he then won, the next thing for God to do was to complete these other things.

0:34:44.420,0:34:47.680
So we would change our prayer points. Each time, we kept on changing them.

0:34:47.680,0:34:50.120
I would tell him, "This is the prayer point".

0:34:50.120,0:34:55.520
Because befor the elction, each time he was praying, I would say, "No, this one!

0:34:55.520,0:34:59.040
This is a selfish prayer. Say, God, let them know that you can.

0:34:59.040,0:35:03.200
Who told you you are the only qualified person! You will change it!"

0:35:03.200,0:35:10.220
When we started praying, "God of T.B. Joshua, let Your favour and mercy speak for us.

0:35:10.220,0:35:15.000
But above all, let Your will be done!"

0:35:15.000,0:35:20.520
So when he won that election, we then had to change the prayer point -

0:35:20.520,0:35:24.140
about the building, establishing those things.

0:35:24.140,0:35:31.980
We then said, "God, establish your finger. Tell them that You are the one that made him dean with one vote".

0:35:31.980,0:35:35.480
We then started praying for the faculty building.

0:35:35.480,0:35:39.020
I was doing my prayers at midnight - every Friday I do prayers at midnight.

0:35:39.020,0:35:41.020
Yes, twelve to three.

0:35:41.020,0:35:45.340
During that midnight prayer, she heard a voice saying, "Embargo".

0:35:45.340,0:35:48.340
During the midnight prayer, I heard, "Embargo".

0:35:48.340,0:35:52.640
I rushed up and woke him up. I said, "There is an embargo in that". We started praying.

0:35:52.640,0:35:57.760
"There is an embargo - a spiritual embargo - so that you will not be able to move there."

0:35:57.760,0:36:00.080
So we now took the Morning Water.

0:36:00.080,0:36:01.060
And administered it.

0:36:01.060,0:36:04.320
I said, "We will fast today - no food this Saturday".

0:36:04.320,0:36:07.960
All of us declared a fast.

0:36:07.960,0:36:11.820
"After the fasting, we will use the Morning Water, and then you take me to that building.

0:36:11.820,0:36:15.680
Let me see that building." A massive building inside the bush.

0:36:15.680,0:36:19.180
We finished with the Morning Water and climbed up.

0:36:19.180,0:36:22.140
I said, "You are the dean. Make a declaration.

0:36:22.140,0:36:25.080
The Bible says, Decree a thing and it shall come to pass.

0:36:25.080,0:36:28.420
So degree! Take!" I gave him the Morning Water.

0:36:28.420,0:36:32.440
We started administering it and then left.

0:36:32.440,0:36:36.740
After praying over the embargo, I was called by the Vice Chancellor.

0:36:36.740,0:36:41.200
Money was released to the contractor.

0:36:41.200,0:36:50.360
Some time this year, around February-March, the Vice Chancellor called most of his friends.

0:36:50.360,0:36:53.740
We gathered at his place.

0:36:53.740,0:37:01.240
We were drinking and relaxing. He then said, "There are council elections upcoming".

0:37:01.240,0:37:07.880
He wanted a quiet administration - an administration that is progress-driven,

0:37:07.880,0:37:14.380
with a focus on academic growth of the university.

0:37:14.380,0:37:21.540
He wanted people who could really join him in the vision he was trying to pursue for the university.

0:37:21.540,0:37:25.240
He was encouraging us that we should not sit on the fence.

0:37:25.240,0:37:31.120
That most of us should run for membership of the governing council.

0:37:31.120,0:37:34.260
So he started mentioning names. He mentioned three names.

0:37:34.260,0:37:37.280
And one of the persons he mentioned said, "Shaka".

0:37:37.280,0:37:39.480
And he said, "Yes, and Shaka".

0:37:39.480,0:37:44.160
I said to myself, "Wow, look at me!" I just came because I was invited.

0:37:44.160,0:37:46.180
I had thought it was just a meeting of friends.

0:37:46.180,0:37:52.200
Now, I had gotten nominated as a member of the governing council.

0:37:52.200,0:37:55.640
I went into that election and of course, I won again.

0:37:55.640,0:37:59.820
This time I knew that the hand of God was upon my life.

0:37:59.820,0:38:02.280
So what an incredible transformation!

0:38:02.280,0:38:06.360
It is a spiritual, physical, marital transformation!

0:38:06.360,0:38:08.520
We just give all the glory to God.

0:38:08.520,0:38:13.060
I think, sir, that you are in the position to give advice to our viewers all over the world,

0:38:13.060,0:38:18.120
watching you right now. What would you tell them, based on your life experiences?

0:38:18.120,0:38:22.160
What I would advise them is: Any person living a wayward life,

0:38:22.160,0:38:27.660
there is no way you can use will power to change your life.

0:38:27.660,0:38:31.940
You have to submit your life totally to God.

0:38:31.940,0:38:39.120
As evangelists at The SCOAN often say, "Go to any living church" - fine!

0:38:39.120,0:38:44.380
But I want to say that when you have tried all the living churches and they have failed you,

0:38:44.380,0:38:49.800
please come to Lagos - come down here and seek the face of God.

0:38:49.800,0:38:53.840
This is where I got my liberation, and this is where I will recommend.

0:38:53.840,0:39:00.200
If you are living a wayward life, staying more at clubs, drinking from one club to another,

0:39:00.200,0:39:05.580
womanising and you can't help yourself, please seek the face of God.

0:39:05.580,0:39:07.380
Thank you very much.

0:39:07.380,0:39:12.160
Madam, what is your best advice you would also give to a spouse

0:39:12.160,0:39:15.060
whose partner is having a destructive addiction?

0:39:15.060,0:39:22.960
Ok. My advice is: They should depend on God.

0:39:22.960,0:39:27.260
They cannot do it on their own. They can't change them.

0:39:27.260,0:39:30.140
We cannot change them.

0:39:30.140,0:39:36.780
I was unable to change my husband but I depended on God,

0:39:36.780,0:39:42.380
knowing full well that He is the author and finisher of our faith.

0:39:42.380,0:39:50.940
And again He says, "I am the God of all flesh. Is there anything too difficult for me to do?"

0:39:50.940,0:39:52.940
Absolutely nothing!

0:39:52.940,0:40:02.300
I would also advise spouses that they should always forgive their spouse.

0:40:02.300,0:40:05.880
They should forgive. They should not hold anything against them

0:40:05.880,0:40:11.880
because it is just like you are holding somebody or yourself.

0:40:11.880,0:40:17.060
If you hold somebody like this, you too are not free - you are holding yourself.

0:40:17.060,0:40:22.280
Release them with forgiveness so that you too will be free.

0:40:22.280,0:40:26.000
Madam, you can obviously confirm the changes in your husband's life

0:40:26.000,0:40:28.200
since his deliverance and freedom.

0:40:28.200,0:40:33.860
Yes, a lot of changes.

0:40:33.860,0:40:36.080
Not going to the club.

0:40:36.080,0:40:45.120
Now, from the office you can boastfully say that at 4 or 5pm, daddy is at home.

0:40:45.120,0:40:48.780
And when he comes back to the house, he doesn't go anywhere.

0:40:48.780,0:40:56.240
Except maybe we are going for fellowship or any other outing that is not clubbing or woman-matter.

0:40:56.240,0:40:59.120
A lot of changes. In fact, God is faithful.

0:40:59.120,0:41:01.520
He is indeed faithful.

0:41:01.520,0:41:08.080
And the best thing that can happen to a family is when both of the couple are in the Lord,

0:41:08.080,0:41:12.140
when you are working together.

0:41:12.140,0:41:16.140
Not this one doing his own, this other person doing her own.

0:41:16.140,0:41:20.700
When the two minds are together, you will see that you will get there.

0:41:20.700,0:41:22.740
Amen.

0:41:22.740,0:41:27.340
Sometimes I would tell him, "You see, daddy, that God is faithful.

0:41:27.340,0:41:34.740
See the way the Lord is beautifying us. You see it because you are no longer doing those acts.

0:41:34.740,0:41:40.820
And each time I kept telling you that God will separate impurities before He will take you".

0:41:40.820,0:41:42.580
She was fond of telling me that.

0:41:42.580,0:41:47.700
Look at it! He has really separated impurities!

0:41:47.700,0:41:54.060
To God be the glory! And what about the relationship with the children?

0:41:54.060,0:41:56.620
The relationship - you see the children being very playful.

0:41:56.620,0:42:00.540
In fact, they are now even closer to him than to myself.

0:42:00.540,0:42:04.740
When he is back from work, you will see the childrein coming, "Daddy, I love you".

0:42:04.740,0:42:06.780
"Daddy, welcome."

0:42:06.780,0:42:13.420
You will see the closeness - they are closer to him than to myself now.

0:42:13.420,0:42:14.580
To Him be the glory!

0:42:14.580,0:42:20.180
That is why we are here - changing lives! The evidence of Christ Jesus is indeed lives changed.

0:42:20.180,0:42:24.740
Actually, a lot of viewers around the world watched your testimony

0:42:24.740,0:42:27.120
and were really touched with what the Lord has done for you.

0:42:27.120,0:42:34.240
So we have a couple of questions, just to round up the programme.

0:42:34.240,0:42:37.600
I have a question for Professor Femi here.

0:42:37.600,0:42:40.880
This is from a viewer in Zambia.

0:42:40.880,0:42:47.040
Alinvia in Zambia asks, "What is your message to the academicians

0:42:47.040,0:42:53.640
whose scientific frame of mind has often led them to doubt the reality of God's power?"

0:42:53.640,0:42:58.360
So there is an academic world like you find yourself in. What would be your message to them?

0:42:58.360,0:43:08.540
Well, I was very touched a couple of days ago when one of the evangelists came to preach to us.

0:43:08.540,0:43:14.800
That the chemical components that make up the human flesh have been scientifically proven.

0:43:14.800,0:43:21.420
That we are made up of sand. That is where we come from.

0:43:21.420,0:43:26.200
Science cannot solve the mysteries of this world.

0:43:26.200,0:43:30.620
I mean, I recollect that when I was in New York and went to the planetarium,

0:43:30.620,0:43:35.520
where you undertake a tour of the planets.

0:43:35.520,0:43:43.220
And I asked myself, "So if the scientists can imagine all these stars in our galaxy alone,

0:43:43.220,0:43:49.140
that you can't count, what makes you think that you can solve the riddle of God's creation?"

0:43:49.140,0:43:53.080
So science cannot answer all our questions.

0:43:53.080,0:44:01.400
We need to get back to God - the origin of our being and creation.

0:44:01.400,0:44:05.140
It does not mean that you will not ask scientific questions

0:44:05.140,0:44:11.700
but you must have God at the background and basis of your enquiry.

0:44:11.700,0:44:17.620
If not, you will get involved in things that will make you to doubt the existence of God

0:44:17.620,0:44:22.020
and that will be on the part of perdition.

0:44:22.020,0:44:23.840
Thank you very much for that.

0:44:23.840,0:44:25.540
Thank you very much.

0:44:25.540,0:44:29.940
We also have another question from our viewers.

0:44:29.940,0:44:32.460
It is actually a funny question.

0:44:32.460,0:44:34.620
It goes to you, madam.

0:44:34.620,0:44:40.080
It is from Betty. She says she is from Colorado in the United States.

0:44:40.080,0:44:48.440
She asks, "What stopped you from rebelling when you saw lipstick marks on your husband?"

0:44:48.440,0:44:49.900
Funny, indeed.

0:44:49.900,0:44:55.320
Because I knew he wasn't the one doing it.

0:44:55.320,0:44:57.800
I knew it was the spirit being.

0:44:57.800,0:45:02.360
I could not fight him but the spirit being.

0:45:02.360,0:45:08.580
Since I knew I could not fight the spirit being - it is God who can fight the spirit being -

0:45:08.580,0:45:11.480
so I moved it through that way in prayer.

0:45:11.480,0:45:12.640
Amen.

0:45:12.640,0:45:15.400
Wow, thank you. That is exactly what Prophet T.B. Joshua says,

0:45:15.400,0:45:20.160
"That if we fail to realise that there are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage,

0:45:20.160,0:45:21.780
we will continue to fight the wrong battle.

0:45:21.780,0:45:24.220
- It is the wrong battle. 
- It is happening in many many homes today.

0:45:24.220,0:45:29.620
Fighting, quarrelling will bring tension in the house so there is no need.

0:45:29.620,0:45:32.820
Exactly. Wow. We really salute your faith, madam.

0:45:32.820,0:45:36.540
We thank God that today, testimony has resulted.

0:45:36.540,0:45:39.840
In fact, what changed him is because of me.

0:45:39.840,0:45:43.640
I have always called her the pastor of the family.

0:45:43.640,0:45:47.840
Because God really wanted to restore my peace.

0:45:47.840,0:45:50.340
So that was why He changed him.

0:45:50.340,0:45:52.120
Amen.

0:45:52.120,0:45:54.120
And you have actually made the right choice.

0:45:54.120,0:45:59.020
Because like the Bible says, The greatest decision you can make in life is to put your trust in God.

0:45:59.020,0:46:03.220
And that is what you have actually done. And He has actually seen you through everything.

0:46:03.220,0:46:05.620
That is one of my prayer points.

0:46:05.620,0:46:10.480
I pray it every day: Let nothing shake my confidence in Him!

0:46:10.480,0:46:15.080
Amen. Thank you so much, Professor Femi and Madam.

0:46:15.080,0:46:16.960

0:46:21.700,0:46:24.960

0:46:24.960,0:46:28.200

0:46:28.200,0:46:31.800
CHANGING LIVES

0:46:31.800,0:46:35.880
In the course of this programme, we believe you have discovered the reality

0:46:35.880,0:46:40.800
that until you experience God, there will be dissatisfaction in your life.

0:46:40.800,0:46:44.380
No matter your status or stature in this world.

0:46:44.380,0:46:51.020
Indeed, viewers. You realised that education is good and wonderful but education is not success.

0:46:51.020,0:46:56.460
It is just to help us to get success when we carry God along.

0:46:56.460,0:47:01.440
And as Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "If your hand is filled with money,

0:47:01.440,0:47:06.260
and your head is filled with information, and your heart is empty,

0:47:06.260,0:47:09.660
then your life is very empty.

0:47:09.660,0:47:15.380
You realised today that so many people try to create happiness for themselves with the things around them.

0:47:15.380,0:47:21.320
But joy is something only believers have because joy is a fruit of faith.

0:47:21.320,0:47:25.840
And we are talking about the kind of joy that nothing in this world can destroy.

0:47:25.840,0:47:29.180
And that is the kind of joy that we as Christians ought to have.

0:47:29.180,0:47:36.060
As the Bible says in the book of John 14:27, "The peace Christ gives is not of this world".

0:47:36.060,0:47:42.080
Therefore, you should not trade your joy or peace for anything this world has to offer.

0:47:42.080,0:47:46.680
Exactly. So viewers around the world, let today's programme encourage you.

0:47:46.680,0:47:51.980
That no matter your situation - don't focus on what is happening in the world around you -

0:47:51.980,0:47:57.500
let your heart rise and seek the things that are above

0:47:57.500,0:48:00.240
and you will be richly blessed, in Jesus' name!

0:48:00.240,0:48:04.080
