PROPHECY TIME

0:00:04.120,0:00:05.960
You're a man.

0:00:05.960,0:00:09.120
Your affection is dead.

0:00:09.120,0:00:13.020
This is giving you loneliness.

0:00:13.020,0:00:14.560
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:14.560,0:00:22.480
Anybody that looks at you would say "hey" but you don't have affection.

0:00:22.480,0:00:25.280
Yes, I struggle too much. You're right, Man of God.

0:00:25.280,0:00:29.780
You don't have affection. Anybody that looks at you - you are a beautiful lady, beautiful woman -

0:00:29.780,0:00:32.380
they want to marry you but you don't have affection.

0:00:32.380,0:00:38.040
They would marry you, after getting married, they would realise that the affection is dead.

0:00:38.040,0:00:39.860
That is the challenge you are facing.

0:00:39.860,0:00:44.440
Yes, Man of God. You are very, very correct.

0:00:44.440,0:00:50.380
You are very, very right.

PROPHECY CONFIRMATION

0:01:03.340,0:01:08.400
My name is Obimma, and this is my lovely husband.

0:01:08.400,0:01:12.000
What the man of God said is very, very correct.

0:01:12.000,0:01:14.920
The problem started when I got married.

0:01:14.920,0:01:20.120
I got married at a very tender age - I was a virgin.

0:01:20.120,0:01:24.500
That very night was not easy for me.

0:01:24.500,0:01:27.180
I cried the whole way through.

0:01:27.180,0:01:29.780
When my mother-in-law noticed what was happening,

0:01:29.780,0:01:32.380
she called me aside and cuddled me.

0:01:32.380,0:01:38.980
She had to mix up some things that would help me calm down.

0:01:38.980,0:01:42.020
It didn't end there.

0:01:42.020,0:01:51.500
From that very moment, I developed phobia with anything that had to do with sex and being with a man.

0:01:51.500,0:01:56.900
Because after that day, I tried several times but I couldn't give in.

0:01:56.900,0:02:01.300
Everything was totally lost - completely out.

0:02:01.300,0:02:08.040
Anything that had to do with intercourse or being married as a couple - I didn't really like it.

0:02:08.040,0:02:11.460
It kept going on and on.

0:02:11.460,0:02:15.300
It kept affecting me so much, even after years of marriage.

0:02:15.300,0:02:22.860
In fact, we were just existing because I always wanted to be out of the house or taking a trip.

0:02:22.860,0:02:24.420
At times, I would use it against him.

0:02:24.420,0:02:29.560
I would say, "Maybe when I come back from London, we will continue", and I would go.

0:02:29.560,0:02:31.960
During that time I stayed for two years and came back again.

0:02:31.960,0:02:34.740
Then I said, "Okay, I have to go to South Africa".

0:02:34.740,0:02:37.980
I went and stayed for five years, then I came back again.

0:02:37.980,0:02:44.360
It wasn't only towards my husband; it was also to other men.

0:02:44.360,0:02:47.640
I would tend to be so aggressive towards people.

0:02:47.640,0:02:49.500
They would see me and like me.

0:02:49.500,0:02:54.820
There was no way that I would be moving around and not see 3 to 5 men staring at me.

0:02:54.820,0:02:58.840
At times, if they stared too long, I would ask them, "What for?"

0:02:58.840,0:03:01.600
It was really affecting me.

0:03:01.600,0:03:05.840
It would affect my business so badly.

0:03:05.840,0:03:10.780
For someone to even make it, a male counterpart would have to come in

0:03:10.780,0:03:13.340
but I was always so aggressive towards them.

0:03:13.340,0:03:16.680
I forgot about marriage.

0:03:16.680,0:03:19.260
I decided to go into business.

0:03:19.260,0:03:23.380
I was just married to my business, married to everything that I was doing.

0:03:23.380,0:03:29.740
It was not as if I was building a house or anything but I saw that business as a way to move away,

0:03:29.740,0:03:36.660
as a way to stay out and not have any form of marriage.

0:03:36.660,0:03:40.080
The affection was totally lost.

0:03:40.080,0:03:44.540
It was a very long time before I conceived.

0:03:44.540,0:03:50.400
On my first and only conception, God blessed me so much.

0:03:50.400,0:03:56.500
By then we had been watching Emmanuel TV because we heard about it in South Africa.

0:03:56.500,0:04:01.920
Even on the day of conception, I was pushing my husband away.

0:04:01.920,0:04:03.820
He was always begging.

0:04:03.820,0:04:06.440
He would say, "Mommy, come now."

0:04:06.440,0:04:09.460
I would say, "No, not tonight".

0:04:09.460,0:04:13.320
I would say, "I'm tired - I'm just coming back".

0:04:13.320,0:04:22.200
But that night, I had gone so long without giving him anything, that I said, "Okay, let me do it".

0:04:22.200,0:04:27.120
Even when he came, I said, "Do this thing fast and let me go".

0:04:27.120,0:04:34.700
When I conceived, it was months after the conception before I realised I was pregnant

0:04:34.700,0:04:39.520
because I didn't know thatjust one short time could get me pregnant.

0:04:39.520,0:04:46.780
As God would have it, I delivered twins - a boy and a girl.

0:04:46.780,0:04:54.220
Mr & Mrs Obimma
Prophecy Confirmation

0:04:54.220,0:04:58.340
Even before I came here, I was hoping for another kind of prophecy.

0:04:58.340,0:05:04.140
When the man of God told me that, I realised it was the root of my problem.

0:05:04.140,0:05:06.640
Indeed, it was the root of my problem.

0:05:06.640,0:05:13.980
Loneliness had come in, boredom - he would ask me out and I would say, "No".

0:05:13.980,0:05:17.260
I wouldn't go anywhere; I would just stay indoors.

0:05:17.260,0:05:26.520
If I wasn't doing business or had to draw money, I didn't want to go out

0:05:26.520,0:05:33.800
because I didn't want to be around anybody who would be frolicking around me.

0:05:33.800,0:05:39.820
Now, after seeing my bundles of joy, I wanted to conceive again.

0:05:39.820,0:05:42.040
You mean immediately the man of God gave you that prophecy,

0:05:42.040,0:05:46.280
you just saw it as a channel of hope?

0:05:46.280,0:05:51.660
When what you are not expecting is thrown at you -

0:05:51.660,0:05:58.760
I was so overwhelmed because it was as if someone somewhere who knew me

0:05:58.760,0:06:03.720
had told the man of God what my problem was.

0:06:03.720,0:06:07.340
You can't imagine the kind of feelings I had inside me.

0:06:07.340,0:06:11.400
So the problem affected your marriage to the extent that after that first child,

0:06:11.400,0:06:16.500
you tried to conceive again but because of that lack of affection, you could not go ahead.

0:06:16.500,0:06:22.660
I still couldn't go ahead. When it was time for us to meet,

0:06:22.660,0:06:25.940
I would say to myself, "Okay, tonight I will try" and I would prepare myself

0:06:25.940,0:06:29.300
but when the time came, I would still push him away.

0:06:29.300,0:06:32.920
But immediately the man of God gave that prophecy,

0:06:32.920,0:06:36.060
can you tell us what God did in your life?

0:06:36.060,0:06:41.660
After the man of God gave me the prophecy, I became so light.

0:06:41.660,0:06:50.040
That very day, I was set free and felt as if I was empty and light.

0:06:50.040,0:06:54.240
I knew something had left me.

0:06:54.240,0:06:56.240
My name is Mr Isaac Obimma.

0:06:56.240,0:06:58.840
We know you would also like to introduce the person standing beside you.

0:06:58.840,0:07:00.200
She is my lovely wife.

0:07:00.200,0:07:01.320
Your lovely wife. Hallelujah.

0:07:01.320,0:07:10.260
When she came back home that Sunday, she told me the prophecy.

0:07:10.260,0:07:15.700
I already knew what the problem was.

0:07:15.700,0:07:22.100
For one reason or another, I couldn't watch Emmanuel TV that Sunday but today,

0:07:22.100,0:07:29.860
I was able to capture the prophecy, which was exactly the problem we were having.

0:07:29.860,0:07:37.020
I'm here today to testify that the prophecy was a hundred percent correct.

0:07:37.020,0:07:42.740
Mr & Mrs Obimma
Prophecy Confirmation

0:07:42.740,0:07:46.480
We just want to ask you briefly as a husband,

0:07:46.480,0:07:52.100
how did that problem of lack of affection affect you as a man?

0:07:52.100,0:08:01.080
Well, what it calls for is patience and talk to God.

0:08:01.080,0:08:04.100
He always resolves all issues.

0:08:04.100,0:08:11.920
While all this was going on, I knew that one day the end would come and here we are today.

0:08:11.920,0:08:13.240
I thank God.

0:08:13.240,0:08:15.600
Hallelujah!

0:08:15.600,0:08:17.320
We thank God.

0:08:17.320,0:08:22.260
Madam, after that prophetic message, we saw how the man of God delivered you

0:08:22.260,0:08:23.840
in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:08:23.840,0:08:28.780
Looking at your husband, how do you now feel towards your husband?

0:08:28.780,0:08:30.860
I feel wonderful - so good.

0:08:30.860,0:08:36.820
Even when I met him --- he is the one 'giving me a tough time' now.

0:08:36.820,0:08:39.460
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:08:39.460,0:08:44.940
Put your hands together for Jesus for the restoration of this marriage!

0:08:44.940,0:08:49.200
At a particular time, I went to him and laid my hand on him; I wanted to lie ---

0:08:49.200,0:08:52.640
He was like, "Hey, what is going on?"

0:08:52.640,0:08:57.160
He was really surprised, after many years of lack of affection in the marriage.

0:08:57.160,0:09:02.560
Because I did not really allow it before.

0:09:02.560,0:09:07.380
Hallelujah. We thank God for the wonderful restoration of this marriage.

0:09:07.380,0:09:09.620
What advice do you want to give to the world

0:09:09.620,0:09:13.700
concerning what God has done in your life through the power of prophecy?

0:09:13.700,0:09:18.740
Okay, I will use my own case as an example.

0:09:18.740,0:09:23.920
This particular thing has destroyed lots of marriages, many homes.

0:09:23.920,0:09:27.880
I was just so fortunate to have this kind of a man,

0:09:27.880,0:09:31.340
because it's not every man that can stand that.

0:09:31.340,0:09:37.020
I know what I'm saying because I'm the one that caused all the havoc.

0:09:37.020,0:09:43.880
It's not every man that can just 'starve' like that - let me just put it in that way.

0:09:43.880,0:09:48.580
Or you leave the man for a long while; you are abroad and he is there.

0:09:48.580,0:09:55.580
Even when he came to visit, there was a particular time he came and we didn't even do anything.

0:09:55.580,0:10:00.220
It was like, "Why did I even come here in the first place?"

0:10:00.220,0:10:06.180
So my advice to people like that is to seek the face of God; something is wrong somewhere.

0:10:06.180,0:10:09.760
As soon as I got delivered, I got myself back.

0:10:09.760,0:10:15.240
Hallelujah. Let us put our hands together once again for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:10:15.240,0:10:25.140
My advice: It's not the best to wish to any man but when it comes your way,

0:10:25.140,0:10:29.420
rest your hope on God. It's as simple as that.

0:10:29.420,0:10:36.900
Hallelujah! We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful blessing He has granted onto this family.

0:10:36.900,0:10:40.240
I want to advise you that now God Almighty has done this wonderful thing,

0:10:40.240,0:10:44.320
continue to make His word the standard for your life and for your marriage

0:10:44.320,0:10:50.620
and we know more and more blessings are on the way. Hallelujah!

0:10:50.620,0:10:53.220
Hallelujah. We give glory to God Almighty!

0:10:53.220,0:10:57.740
Let us put our hands together once again for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:10:57.740,0:11:03.760
