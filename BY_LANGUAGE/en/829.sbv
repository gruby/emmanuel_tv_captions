Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.000,0:00:05.300
Today is another day that the Lord has made.

0:00:05.300,0:00:10.020
And we want to do a little bit of good, to change the bad that we see.

0:00:10.020,0:00:17.080
Remember, love never gets tired of doing good because that love is the strength of God.

0:00:17.080,0:00:21.080
Like the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says, Love always looks around.

0:00:21.080,0:00:25.320
Love always searches to see who is in need.

0:00:25.320,0:00:30.080
That is what we're doing today, here in the United States of America; in the state of Ohio.

0:00:30.080,0:00:34.960
We have got a special event tonight whereby we will be going into the low income neighbourhoods

0:00:34.960,0:00:39.940
meeting some of the disabled and elderly and we will be providing them with some goods.

0:00:39.940,0:00:51.000
Emmanuel TV Team sets up for the Charity Event.

0:00:51.000,0:01:00.000
As you can see right here, we've got some live produce; we have baskets of groceries.

0:01:00.000,0:01:07.420
The reason why we have baskets of groceries is because a lot of the elderly have expressed this to us,

0:01:07.420,0:01:10.960
that they really need some baskets for laundry as well.

0:01:10.960,0:01:14.220
So we were able to accomplish two things at once.

0:01:14.220,0:01:16.840
I am going to show you some of the things that we have here.

0:01:16.840,0:01:43.640
We have macaroni and cheese, chips, bread, eight pound bags of potatoes, bananas and water.

0:01:43.640,0:01:51.960
If you look over here, we have a Backpack Program for the youth.

0:01:51.960,0:01:58.140
We have the Emmanuel TV backpacks.

0:01:58.140,0:02:06.580
The Backpack Program has Emmanuel TV backpacks that have the words 'Keep watching Emmanuel TV" -

0:02:06.580,0:02:09.160
"Changing lives. Changing nations. Changing the world" - printed on them.

0:02:09.160,0:02:17.840
The bag also has all of the Emmanuel TV social media contacts on it - Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.

0:02:17.840,0:02:27.600
It has the main website as well, Instagram and the Emmanuel TV email address on it.

0:02:27.600,0:02:34.920
We did this so that people could stay connected. This Backpack Program is for the students.

0:02:34.920,0:02:42.300
It is for Elementary, Middle School and High School students.

0:02:42.300,0:02:49.000
We got this Backpack Program for them because many of them are only able to eat at school during lunch.

0:02:49.000,0:02:53.000
Some of them can get breakfast but most of them don't. They are able to eat their lunch.

0:02:53.000,0:02:58.760
But many of them when they are coming back home are coming into an environment where there is no food.

0:02:58.760,0:03:05.120
Especially on the weekend. Therefore the man of God has made it possible,

0:03:05.120,0:03:16.420
and provided the resources. So that we can help the youth to stay healthy and not have to worry about food.

0:03:16.420,0:03:19.600
They can go ahead to school and get an education.

0:03:19.600,0:03:25.060
So we want to show you some of the goods that we have for the Backpack Program.

0:03:25.060,0:03:50.260
We make sure that they have water, healthy drinks, packs of oatmeal for a good breakfast.

0:03:50.260,0:04:02.000
We also provide cheese crackers; making sure that they have granola bars.

0:04:02.000,0:04:15.220
Over here we have some noodles, these are basically meals that they can quickly make for themselves.

0:04:15.220,0:04:34.680
We ensure they have boxes of cereal. To ensure they stay as healthy as possible, we have real cheese sticks.

0:04:34.680,0:04:58.400
We've provided yogurt packs. For meat, we've provided tuna cans and canned sausage.

0:04:58.400,0:05:06.900
One of the other things that the parents can help with is this vegetable barley soup.

0:05:06.900,0:05:10.880
That's already been put together. To prepare, the parents can just pour it all in.

0:05:10.880,0:05:16.620
This soup is enough to serve ten full meals.

0:05:16.620,0:05:23.000
It is very good. We have tried it ourselves and it is very delicious. It is a vegetable barley soup.

0:05:23.000,0:05:25.980
They are getting this kind of meal as well.

0:05:25.980,0:05:35.000
They will be getting pudding and other healthy little items.

0:05:35.000,0:05:51.840
Apple sauce and some snacks like graham crackers and fruit snacks as well.

0:05:51.840,0:06:01.000
They have more snacks like chips and so forth.

0:06:01.000,0:06:04.500
And that is what happens with the Backpack Program.

0:06:04.500,0:06:12.100
They will be able to take this back pack and be able to come every time they need food.

0:06:12.100,0:06:16.640
They will be able to come back with the backpack and we will be able to continue to fill it.

0:06:16.640,0:06:25.020
So that's what the Backpack Program is about. The Emmanuel TV Backpack.

0:06:25.020,0:06:31.820
Now I also want to show you what we will be having in the baskets as well. So come this way.

0:06:31.820,0:06:36.260
At the food pantry located inside the Emmanuel TV USA office,

0:06:36.260,0:06:40.300
the Emmanuel TV team removes frozen packs of meat from the deep freezer,

0:06:40.300,0:06:42.580
wearing protective masks and gloves.

0:06:42.580,0:06:46.620
Through the assistance of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners,

0:06:46.620,0:06:50.180
the pantry is always fully stocked with various food items,

0:06:50.180,0:06:55.460
in preparation to carry out Christ's mission to feed the needy.

0:06:55.460,0:07:00.000
Emmanuel TV Team Prepares Packs Of Frozen Meat For Charity Event.

0:07:00.000,0:07:05.320
After being removed from the freezer, they tear open the larger packs of frozen meat.

0:07:05.320,0:07:12.800
One by one the frozen hamburger patties, chicken fingers, tenders and other meat,

0:07:12.800,0:07:18.760
are carefully placed into individual bags for each person who will receive them.

0:07:18.760,0:07:24.320
The Emmanuel TV Team give their quality time, quality love and quality care,

0:07:24.320,0:07:31.380
knowing that when you give love in truth, you are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to you.

0:07:31.380,0:07:37.000
Emmanuel TV Team Prepares Packs Of Frozen Meat For Charity Event.

0:07:37.000,0:07:41.680
As Christians, we should spend more on others and less on ourselves.

0:07:41.680,0:07:48.540
That is the only way that we can commit more faith and love in the society of which we are a part.

0:07:48.540,0:07:55.660
Love looks around to see those who are in need. These packs of frozen meat are just one of the many items,

0:07:55.660,0:08:00.940
that the Emmanuel TV Team is planning to distribute to those in need.

0:08:00.940,0:08:05.000
Emmanuel TV Team Prepares Packs Of Frozen Meat For Charity Event.

0:08:05.000,0:08:09.500
The book of James says that we must back up our faith with good deeds

0:08:09.500,0:08:12.700
for faith without good deeds is dead.

0:08:12.700,0:08:19.700
And our faith works by love. Therefore, we should love for God's sake and be loved.

0:08:19.700,0:08:30.280
Help for God's sake and be helped. Be kind for God's sake and receive kindness.

0:08:30.280,0:08:42.280
All this meat is going to be given away. This meat has hamburger patties, chicken fingers and tenders as well.

0:08:42.280,0:08:51.240
We have chicken patties also. We just have a whole lot of meat here.

0:08:51.240,0:08:54.040
That will do good for them as well.

0:08:54.040,0:09:00.860
You can see we have a whole bag full of meat. That's what we will be doing today.

0:09:00.860,0:09:05.000
We will be carrying you along and make sure you're able to see everything that is going on.

0:09:05.000,0:09:08.600
Emmanuel! (Matthew 1:23 - God is with us). Stay in faith.

0:09:08.600,0:09:13.300
Emmanuel TV Team Lays Out Backpacks For Filling And Distribution.

0:09:13.300,0:09:18.420
The team effort continues inside the Emmanuel TV USA Office facilities.

0:09:18.420,0:09:24.640
As the Emmanuel TV Team lays out backpacks and baskets for the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program,

0:09:24.640,0:09:35.260
the blue Emmanuel TV backpacks are neatly arranged in an orderly manner on the floor.

0:09:35.260,0:09:41.260
Next up, it's time to fill the baskets with the food stuffs provided by Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:09:41.260,0:09:44.360
and the Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:09:44.360,0:09:52.940
Bags of potatoes are the first items to be loaded into the baskets. Each basket gets its own bag.

0:09:52.940,0:09:56.420
These baskets are a two-fold blessing.

0:09:56.420,0:10:02.900
They're not only for carrying food items but can be reused for laundry purposes.

0:10:02.900,0:10:12.680
Here come some more food items. Ripe bananas - a good source of fibre and energy for the grateful receivers.

0:10:12.680,0:10:20.860
Loaves of bread are the next food item, followed by tortilla chips.

0:10:20.860,0:10:24.000
A variety of chips are available.

0:13:02.000,0:13:03.000
Yes.

0:13:03.000,0:13:09.000
Ok, here you go.

0:13:09.000,0:13:10.760
Thank you, Sir.

Love is the greatest Christian virtue.

0:18:14.400,0:18:17.600
Emmanuel, (God with us - Matthew 1:23) viewers! Indeed, God is with us.

0:18:17.600,0:18:21.040
And of course we're reporting live, all the way from the USA.

0:18:21.040,0:18:26.960
We're here in Ohio in the city of Middletown. I've got some very special guests with us right now.

0:18:26.960,0:18:30.940
I'm going to start by first asking his name. Brother, can you please tell me your name?

0:18:30.940,0:18:32.080
Jeff.

0:18:32.080,0:18:34.180
Ok Jeff, tell me where you're from?

0:18:34.180,0:18:38.120
I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.

0:18:38.120,0:18:41.740
I would like to ask you what you think about today.

0:18:41.740,0:18:47.420
You saw people coming to get some groceries and cash gifts.

0:18:47.420,0:18:55.660
There are about 80 apartments in this building and people came out by the masses and partook.

0:18:55.660,0:18:58.600
Tell me - how do you feel about that?

0:18:58.600,0:19:04.920
Well, I think it was a Godsent thing. And it was a blessing.

0:19:04.920,0:19:10.060
Some of us are struggling, not as fortunate as others. What you guys do is beautiful.

0:19:10.060,0:19:12.200
Thank you

0:19:12.200,0:19:21.560
Tell me the different people that we have here. We've got the disabled, and what other conditions are there?

0:19:21.560,0:19:29.000
We have the elderly, disabled, people that are unemployed, homeless

0:19:29.000,0:19:36.500
and people who are just struggling - scraping finger to toe - trying to make it everyday in life.

0:19:36.500,0:19:38.820
Just doing what we can to survive.

0:19:38.820,0:19:47.200
I noticed that some of the people that came and partook of the groceries and cash gifts are people that

0:19:47.200,0:19:51.160
came and helped other people as well. As far as staying with them.

0:19:51.160,0:20:03.080
There are one or two bedrooms, not mansions but many of you are taking in other people to stay with you, right?

0:20:03.080,0:20:07.460
Yes, this building is like an 84 or 86 apartment building.

0:20:07.460,0:20:12.300
Black, white, all different races - it doesn't matter - red, blue, green and yellow. We all stick together.

0:20:12.300,0:20:16.780
and whatever it takes, if I'm eating, you can eat and if I have a shirt, you don't have one,

0:20:16.780,0:20:20.180
you can get one and vice versa. We just look out for each other.

0:20:20.180,0:20:27.000
Great, that is what we saw. We saw everybody come and partake.

0:20:27.000,0:20:28.800
That goes without words.

0:20:28.800,0:20:33.860
I could never thank you enough, but T.B. Joshua, you are a blessing to us and many others.

0:20:33.860,0:20:36.720
God bless you for everything that you did.

0:20:36.720,0:20:42.680
Alright. You heard it from our brother and I want you to know that relationship is supposed to be for a lifetime.

0:20:42.680,0:20:44.080
I am hoping that this one will be.

0:20:44.080,0:20:45.280
So we will continue.

0:20:45.280,0:20:46.400
I would love that.

0:20:46.400,0:20:47.120
Thank you very much.

0:20:47.120,0:20:48.080
You're welcome.

0:20:48.080,0:20:53.000
Emmanuel, (God with us - Matthew 1:23) viewers! Here we are once again and I have got a very special guest.

0:20:53.000,0:21:00.900
Of course today, we just had the event of being able to feed this housing development.

0:21:00.900,0:21:09.300
There are about 86 apartments in this building and a very special sister came aboard and began to help us.

0:21:09.300,0:21:16.720
She put her hands in and began to tote bags to different apartments of the ones that could not come down.

0:21:16.720,0:21:23.040
She took up the groceries and has done a great job. I will start by asking her name. Sister, what is your name?

0:21:23.040,0:21:24.620
My name is Eunice Thomas.

0:21:24.620,0:21:27.140
Tell me where are you from?

0:21:27.140,0:21:28.340
I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio.

0:21:28.340,0:21:37.760
Wow, Cincinnati, of course, is about 35 - 40 minutes from here.

0:21:37.760,0:21:42.780
Tell us about your experience today. What did you see?

0:21:42.780,0:21:44.260
People needed you.

0:21:44.260,0:21:47.560
It was a blessing that you guys came.

0:21:47.560,0:21:50.560
There are a lot of people struggling, like myself.

0:21:50.560,0:21:59.560
Some people have no income, some people are disabled, trying to get disability support, I'm a widow.

0:21:59.560,0:22:02.780
There are a lot of elderly people also and people with kids.

0:22:02.780,0:22:06.860
There are a lot of people that work but still can't make ends meet.

0:22:06.860,0:22:11.980
A lot of people team up in one household to try and make ends meet.

0:22:11.980,0:22:17.060
So anything that they can be helped with, they would be grateful.

0:22:17.060,0:22:27.700
Wow, you said a mouthful there. You said that you are a widow and are waiting for assistance to be helped.

0:22:27.700,0:22:33.220
So when you see charity organisations like this, it's a big help, right?

0:22:33.220,0:22:34.880
I appreciate it.

0:22:34.880,0:22:45.300
Before you came, I was really depressed and didn't know what today or tomorrow would bring.

0:22:45.300,0:22:49.280
When you came, it brightened me up. Thank you.

0:22:49.280,0:22:58.580
We thank you so much. The support comes all the way from Nigeria. From the man of God T.B. Joshua.

0:22:58.580,0:23:01.220
T.B. Joshua, thank you very much.

0:23:01.220,0:23:08.260
If there is anything I can do beyond this, don`t hesitate to contact me; I`m available.

0:23:08.260,0:23:19.220
My sister, we thank you so very much for putting your hands to the plow helping us in feeding everyone today.

0:23:19.220,0:23:21.460

0:25:54.340,0:25:57.180
And we have a cash gift too.

0:25:57.180,0:25:58.760
Oh wow!

0:25:58.760,0:26:00.560

The Emmanuel TV Team commences the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program,

0:26:17.640,0:26:25.140
delivering the Emmanuel TV Backpacks to students at the Lakota Pointe Government Housing Estate, Ohio, USA.

0:26:25.140,0:26:34.500
Emmanuel, viewers! Here we are in the West Chester area of Ohio, a subdivision of the Cincinnati area.

0:26:34.500,0:26:40.440
This is Lakota Pointe - a government housing project right across from the school.

0:26:40.440,0:26:44.160
This is one of the places where we are doing the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.

0:26:44.160,0:26:51.280
It is Friday, and we have come out and made sure that all of the youth have gotten a backpack,

0:26:51.280,0:26:54.680
with six different meals inside of them.

0:26:54.680,0:27:00.420
Many of them are from broken homes or homes where it's only the mother and themselves.

0:27:00.420,0:27:07.500
Therefore, it's all because of the generosity of the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners.

0:27:07.500,0:27:14.220
They have assisted us and provided the resources to be able to support them and to let them know

0:27:14.220,0:27:16.080
that they should stay in school.

0:27:16.080,0:27:19.720
That's the message from the man of God that they should stay in school.

0:27:19.720,0:27:25.880
When their purpose is clear, their life will have meaning. This is the message that we're passing on to them.

0:27:25.880,0:27:32.340
That when their purpose, their dreams and goals are clear then their life will have meaning.

0:27:32.340,0:27:39.000
And to also let them know to never underestimate the mind. That when you decide what you want to do,

0:27:39.000,0:27:43.640
then your mind will help you figure out how to do it.

0:27:43.640,0:27:47.660
So this is the message that we have been passing on to them and we will continue.

0:27:47.660,0:27:50.820
You've seen many of them get their Emmanuel TV Backpacks,

0:27:50.820,0:27:56.900
and every week we will continue to fill it up for them. Especially on the weekends,

0:27:56.900,0:28:01.200
we will fill it up for them because many of them only really eat when they go to school.

0:28:01.200,0:28:05.660
A lot of them when they come back home it's more of a challenge. Many of them are at home by themselves,

0:28:05.660,0:28:10.620
because being in single parent homes means that the parent is often at work.

0:28:10.620,0:28:17.640
Therefore, we are providing them with meals that are very easy to make by themselves.

0:28:17.640,0:28:22.340
Once again, Emmanuel! Indeed, God is with us.

0:28:22.340,0:28:42.000
Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.

0:28:42.000,0:28:47.340
Remember, as we said before. We are passing on these encouraging words.

0:28:47.340,0:28:57.000
We have seen a lot of things happen from teen suicides to youth committing suicide and it is all because

0:28:57.000,0:29:02.480
many of them were affected by peer pressure. They did not measure up to one another's standards.

0:29:02.480,0:29:10.220
The message that we pass on is "don't allow yourself to be defined by the opinions of others".

0:29:10.220,0:29:17.200
"Love yourself, value yourself." - this is very important. We pass on the message that

0:29:17.200,0:29:24.340
the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Your dream is a photograph of your future".

0:29:24.340,0:29:31.500
That's right, your dream is a glimpse into your future. When you're going through hard times, it's that dream,

0:29:31.500,0:29:36.760
that will help sustain you through those troubled times.

0:29:36.760,0:29:42.420
We also pass on the message that you're born choosers and not losers.

0:29:42.420,0:29:47.600
You're born choosers and not losers. The decisions and the choices that they make everyday

0:29:47.600,0:29:55.220
will affect their tomorrow. These are the messages that we are passing on to these students

0:29:55.220,0:30:01.020
as we refill their backpacks through the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.

0:30:01.020,0:30:03.940
Henry Ford said a hundred years ago that the only thing that matters

0:30:03.940,0:30:07.960
is if we made a difference in the life of a child.

0:30:07.960,0:30:12.300
And because of the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua, that's what is happening right now.

0:30:12.300,0:30:20.600
We're able to make a difference in the lives of these students, in the lives of these children.

0:30:20.600,0:30:29.480
Many of them are going home to single parent homes, coming from broken families as well.

0:30:29.480,0:30:35.320
We just want them to know and encourage them to stay in school.

0:30:35.320,0:30:44.080
We want you to know that, nothing is too big or too small; ever little bit counts.

0:30:44.080,0:31:07.140
Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.

0:31:07.140,0:31:19.860
Another thing that we want you to know is that in each backpack, every student has a small cash gift on the inside.

0:31:19.860,0:31:23.680
This is simply because we want to be a father to the fatherless.

0:31:23.680,0:31:29.380
We want to do our part in being a father to the fatherless. The brother to the brotherless.

0:31:29.380,0:31:37.080
We can be a sister to the sisterless. It is to show that every little bit counts.

0:31:37.080,0:31:44.400
You'll see that a lot of them sometimes look inside, then jump, smile and have a wild look on their face

0:31:44.400,0:31:51.920
because on the inside, we have made sure that they have a small cash gift.

0:31:51.920,0:31:58.280
These little things mean a lot.

0:31:58.280,0:32:26.500
Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.

0:32:26.500,0:32:37.500
Emmanuel! Indeed, God is wih us. We are here at Lakota Pointe - a subdivision of the Cincinnati area.

0:32:37.500,0:32:39.380
We've got a very special sister here.

0:32:39.380,0:32:41.200
Sister, can you tell me how old you are?

0:32:41.200,0:32:42.180
I am 15.

0:32:42.180,0:32:44.040
15. Wow. Can I get your name?

0:32:44.040,0:32:45.840
My name is Zaimir.

0:32:45.840,0:32:50.900
I was speaking with her and she let me know that her dreams and her goals are clear.

0:32:50.900,0:32:55.280
I want her to tell you what she's going to be.

0:32:55.280,0:33:01.320
I want to be an entrepreneur and I want to be the biggest WNBA basketball star.

0:33:01.320,0:33:03.660
I am a basketball fan and I believe I can fulfill that dream.

0:33:03.660,0:33:12.300
Yes, we believe that as well. We are sponsored and supported by someone that lets us know that,

0:33:12.300,0:33:16.440
when you decide what you want to do, then your mind will help you figure out how to do it.

0:33:16.440,0:33:23.500
It seems like you have decided on what you want to do so don't let anybody stop you from your dream and goal.

0:33:23.500,0:33:29.960
We will continue to come out and support you. Make sure you keep your Emmanuel TV Backpack

0:33:29.960,0:33:33.200
so we can keep supporting you every week. Ok.

0:33:33.200,0:33:34.140
Thank you.

0:33:34.140,0:33:36.180
So look into the camera and say Hello.

0:33:36.180,0:33:38.000
Hello!

0:33:38.000,0:33:39.000
Thank you.

0:33:39.000,0:33:40.000
Bye.

0:33:40.000,0:33:45.000
Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.

0:33:45.000,0:33:50.800
When we are in the business of giving charitably, I mean sowing into other people's lives,

0:33:50.800,0:33:57.840
God who is the dispenser of all good will give us, in His mercy, abundance of good

0:33:57.840,0:34:02.000
so that we might enjoy the sufficiency and abound in good works.
