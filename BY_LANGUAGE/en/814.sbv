0:00:00.000,0:00:04.040
I see you have a heart for God.

0:00:04.040,0:00:09.100
You love Jesus. You're always in the church.

0:00:09.100,0:00:11.000
Yes.

0:00:11.000,0:00:17.300
Praising God but there is an evil spirit in your life.

0:00:17.300,0:00:18.520
Yes!

0:00:18.520,0:00:22.000
A demon possesses you.

0:00:22.000,0:00:23.580
That is why I've come here.

0:00:23.580,0:00:29.500
Before now, you keep asking yourself, "What kind of spirit is this?"

0:00:29.500,0:00:34.220
But this time, he appeared to you face to face, physically.

0:00:34.220,0:00:41.600
You can see physically that a demon is using your body as a dwelling place.

0:00:41.600,0:00:46.660
In fact, it chased me from the US to here.

0:00:46.660,0:00:51.920
It kept attacking me in the dream, even when I'm not sleeping,

0:00:51.920,0:00:54.860
like wrestling with me.

0:00:54.860,0:00:57.120
And I came here to...

0:00:57.120,0:01:05.640
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:05.640,0:01:12.660
It's out.

0:01:12.660,0:01:15.000
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:01:15.000,0:01:22.540
It has destroyed you, destroyed your family, destroyed everything, your career.

0:01:22.540,0:01:24.960
You're an elder in the church.

0:01:24.960,0:01:26.540
Yes.

0:01:26.540,0:01:30.280
Can you see demon? Demon is a foolish thing

0:01:30.280,0:01:33.920
and it's now tormenting an elder in the church.

0:01:33.920,0:01:40.380
But it's over now. It will never come on you again.

0:01:40.380,0:01:44.000
Seriously, I was thinking, when I get back to the US,

0:01:44.000,0:01:46.720
I'm not going back to that church again.

0:01:46.720,0:01:49.040
The church I was going to was a redeemed church.

0:01:49.040,0:01:50.860
I don't know where this demon came from.

0:01:50.860,0:01:54.360
As an elder, don't leave the church. Stay in the church.

0:01:54.360,0:01:56.740
- The demon will not torment you again.
- Amen.

0:01:56.740,0:02:01.780
Continue your services of God there, don't leave the place.

0:02:01.780,0:02:04.480
I'll be your friend, your partner in prayer.

0:02:04.480,0:02:10.260
Amen! Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!

0:02:10.260,0:02:15.460
Prophecy Confirmation

0:02:15.460,0:02:18.560
Sir, we welcome you to The Synagogue Church once again, in Jesus' name.

0:02:18.560,0:02:21.920
Can you please tell us your name and where you come from.

0:02:21.920,0:02:24.500
My name is Moses Adeola.

0:02:24.500,0:02:29.200
I'm from Osun State, Nigeria but I came from the US because I'm based in the US.

0:02:29.200,0:02:33.420
Tell us the message of prophecy you've received from the anointed man of God.

0:02:33.420,0:02:37.680
During the worship, the man of God called me out and said

0:02:37.680,0:02:40.480
that I have a heart for God,

0:02:40.480,0:02:42.820
I've never missed church,

0:02:42.820,0:02:51.640
that I'm always in the church praising God - in fact, that is true -

0:02:51.640,0:03:00.940
and that I'm an elder in the church but I have this demonic attack all the time.

0:03:00.940,0:03:03.140
This is true, I confirm it.

0:03:03.140,0:03:08.520
As a matter of fact, before I left the US, that was part of the problem.

0:03:08.520,0:03:16.420
The demonic attack comes all the time, it lives inside me.

0:03:16.420,0:03:22.140
I see you have a heart for God. You love Jesus.

0:03:22.140,0:03:25.180
You are always in the church.

0:03:25.180,0:03:27.000
Yes.

0:03:27.000,0:03:33.320
Praising God but there is an evil spirit in your life.

0:03:33.320,0:03:34.600
Yes.

0:03:34.600,0:03:38.140
A demon possesses you.

0:03:38.140,0:03:39.740
That is why I have come here.

0:03:39.740,0:03:45.780
Before now, you keep asking yourself, "What kind of spirit is this?"

0:03:45.780,0:03:50.200
But this time, he appeared to you face to face, physically.

0:03:50.200,0:03:57.640
You can see physically that a demon is using your body as a dwelling place.

0:03:57.640,0:04:04.920
In fact, before I left, I had to struggle with it,

0:04:04.920,0:04:07.400
like we were struggling with one another.

0:04:07.400,0:04:10.140
I had to beat him out and run out.

0:04:10.140,0:04:14.100
It was like the demon was chasing me,

0:04:14.100,0:04:19.520
even to come to Nigeria, because when I was in the plane, I still saw it

0:04:19.520,0:04:22.560
and when I arrived in Nigeria, I still saw it.

0:04:22.560,0:04:25.660
So, I was confused about that.

0:04:25.660,0:04:31.200
Sir, you mean, all what the man of God said about you is true.

0:04:31.200,0:04:35.780
That is, you have a heart for God, and you love God,

0:04:35.780,0:04:40.160
you're always in the church praising God but there's a demon that lives inside you,

0:04:40.160,0:04:46.040
that uses your body and it even manifests to you in the physical.

0:04:46.040,0:04:50.060
Can you tell us, how did the man of God put the prophecy?

0:04:50.060,0:04:53.880
Yes, what the man of God said was true.

0:04:53.880,0:04:56.380
I love God.

0:04:56.380,0:04:58.880
I like to worship.

0:04:58.880,0:05:03.920
He said that this demonic attack had possessed me,

0:05:03.920,0:05:08.660
a demon lives inside me, my body.

0:05:08.660,0:05:14.840
It is true because I see it even when I'm not sleeping.

0:05:14.840,0:05:18.760
So, what the man of God said was true.

0:05:18.760,0:05:22.480
Okay, do you believe now that this prophecy you have received today

0:05:22.480,0:05:27.740
has put an end to this common calamity of human life that you've been experiencing?

0:05:27.740,0:05:33.780
Yes, I believe. The man of God prayed for me and the Lord revealed it to him.

0:05:33.780,0:05:37.300
I believe that I have overcome it.

0:05:37.300,0:05:41.140
I have the victory now and I thank God for it.

0:05:41.140,0:05:45.140
Amen. And the man of God also told you in the prophecy

0:05:45.140,0:05:48.340
that you should not leave the church

0:05:48.340,0:05:54.060
since you have decided to remain in God's presence to praise Him -

0:05:54.060,0:05:57.900
you should not allow this problem to make you to leave the presence of God.

0:05:57.900,0:05:59.160
Is that true for your life?

0:05:59.160,0:06:03.800
Yes, that is true because the demonic attack was so much.

0:06:03.800,0:06:07.100
I didn't know where it was coming from

0:06:07.100,0:06:12.240
so I said, when I get back to the US, I'm going to quit going to that church

0:06:12.240,0:06:18.280
and then go to the Lord and pray, to see where the Lord will lead me.

0:06:18.280,0:06:25.960
But the man of God advised me to stay there and not to quit the church.

0:06:25.960,0:06:28.500
You are an elder in the church.

0:06:28.500,0:06:29.960
Yes.

0:06:29.960,0:06:33.880
Can you see demon? A demon is a foolish thing

0:06:33.880,0:06:37.460
and it's now tormenting an elder in the church.

0:06:37.460,0:06:43.900
But it's over now. It will never come on you again.

0:06:43.900,0:06:47.340
Seriously, I was thinking, when I get back to the US,

0:06:47.340,0:06:49.960
I'm not going back to that church again.

0:06:49.960,0:06:52.500
The church I was going to was a redeemed church.

0:06:52.500,0:06:54.400
I don't know where this demon came from.

0:06:54.400,0:06:57.840
As an elder, don't leave the church, stay in the church.

0:06:57.840,0:07:00.200
- The demon will not torment you again.
- Amen.

0:07:00.200,0:07:05.280
Continue your services of God there, don't leave the place.

0:07:05.280,0:07:08.360
I'll be your friend, your partner in prayer.

0:07:08.360,0:07:10.780
I agreed with him.

0:07:10.780,0:07:15.060
To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for this wonderful revelation and deliverance

0:07:15.060,0:07:18.120
that you have received today through the message of prophecy.

0:07:18.120,0:07:21.880
And we want to encourage you as a believer in Christ Jesus

0:07:21.880,0:07:26.400
to maintain your stand in Christ Jesus and make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:07:26.400,0:07:31.900
Remember that sometimes foolish things may happen

0:07:31.900,0:07:40.120
to strengthen our desire and our determination to follow our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:07:40.120,0:07:43.580
As you make the Word of God the standard for your life today,

0:07:43.580,0:07:46.700
this wonderful deliverance you've received through the prophecy

0:07:46.700,0:07:49.220
will be permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:07:49.220,0:07:50.940
Amen, I receive that.

0:07:50.940,0:07:52.360
Thank you very much.

0:07:52.360,0:07:55.400
Prophecy Continues
