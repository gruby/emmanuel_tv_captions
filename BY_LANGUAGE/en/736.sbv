0:00:05.360,0:00:09.000
This is addiction, pornography.

0:00:09.020,0:00:09.900
It's true.

0:00:09.940,0:00:11.400
You watch pornography.

0:00:11.440,0:00:12.200
It's true.

0:00:12.280,0:00:14.180
And it becomes part of your blood.

0:00:14.180,0:00:14.900
It's true.

0:00:14.920,0:00:17.100
My wife was complaining, she said that I must stop reading.

0:00:17.160,0:00:17.700
Who?

0:00:17.780,0:00:21.640
My wife. She said that I must stop reading the Bible through my cell phone.

0:00:21.640,0:00:24.500
Whereas you are not reading the Bible, it's pornography you are watching.

0:00:24.500,0:00:25.500
It's true, it's true!

0:00:25.500,0:00:27.000
She will be complaining the whole night.

0:00:27.000,0:00:31.620
You see people today, when they say they are reading, when it is a different thing.

0:00:31.620,0:00:32.420
It's true.

0:00:32.420,0:00:33.400
Where is your wife?

0:00:33.440,0:00:35.360
She is back in South Africa.

0:00:35.360,0:00:37.940
I will invite her, don't worry. It is not an issue.

0:00:37.940,0:00:40.500
This pornography has destroyed your marriage.

0:00:40.500,0:00:42.700
Thank you, it is true. There is no affection between me and my wife.

0:00:42.760,0:00:44.600
You see your wife as a cheat.

0:00:44.600,0:00:45.500
It's true.

0:00:45.580,0:00:47.000
You just see anything bad about her.

0:00:47.000,0:00:48.900
It's true, it's true, man of God.

0:00:48.960,0:00:49.760
It's true.

0:01:00.600,0:01:04.000
My names are Tshiuhombera Tshiridzi Oscar.

0:01:04.080,0:01:06.100
I'm coming from South Africa.

0:01:06.160,0:01:10.100
I am an environmental consultant by profession.

0:01:10.160,0:01:14.160
Before you begin to talk, let me give a handshake to my sister.

0:01:14.160,0:01:18.500
I want to thank you for honouring this invitation.

0:01:18.500,0:01:22.400
And, I mean, ordinarily this woman would not come here.

0:01:22.480,0:01:26.400
Because it's just a phone call, and immediately

0:01:26.420,0:01:30.180
she said, "No, man of God is calling me, I have to be there".

0:01:30.180,0:01:30.800
Thank you very much.

0:01:30.820,0:01:31.460
Thank you.

0:01:31.460,0:01:38.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:38.720,0:01:42.100
The person beside me is my lovely wife.

0:01:42.100,0:01:44.000
She arrived yesterday.

0:01:44.020,0:01:53.300
Look, for you to know that you just have to continue to pray for this ministry.

0:01:53.340,0:01:57.800
After that prophetic word last Sunday, I said,

0:01:57.820,0:02:00.700
"You are not going home until I see your wife.

0:02:00.720,0:02:03.900
Because the home is broken".

0:02:03.980,0:02:06.900
And I had to give a phone call to the wife

0:02:06.940,0:02:12.300
and arrange how the wife can come down from South Africa.

0:02:12.380,0:02:17.800
Because if I allow him to go, I have not done anything.

0:02:17.880,0:02:19.900
The woman must be here.

0:02:19.920,0:02:23.900
If not, all is in vain.

0:02:23.900,0:02:28.100
The reason that brought me to the Synagogue Church of All Nations

0:02:28.100,0:02:31.400
was problem in  my business.

0:02:31.460,0:02:35.900
There was stagnation, career failure, limitation.

0:02:35.980,0:02:38.840
You know, many of us we are here for certain things.

0:02:38.860,0:02:39.920
You don't know your problem.

0:02:39.920,0:02:42.500
What you are asking for is not even your problem.

0:02:42.580,0:02:46.300
He came because of business failure.

0:02:46.320,0:02:52.800
But the Lord is now telling him, "Your problem is pornography".

0:02:52.820,0:02:54.500
There is a broken home.

0:02:54.540,0:02:56.200
That is your problem.

0:02:56.220,0:02:59.460
Once that is solved, the business will start to ...

0:02:59.460,0:03:01.680
When you have a sickness, you'll hear, "I'm sick, I'm sick".

0:03:01.680,0:03:05.400
You never bother with the cause of that sickness.

0:03:05.480,0:03:09.000
"I have failure in business, that is our problem".

0:03:09.040,0:03:13.000
But what is the cause of that failure?

0:03:13.060,0:03:15.620
"I have a headache, please pray for  me".

0:03:15.680,0:03:19.100
But you don't mind the cause of that headache.

0:03:19.100,0:03:23.400
This is why this problem continued to repeat again.

0:03:23.480,0:03:32.300
If you have not touched the root, and you remove the sickness - you are deceiving yourself.

0:03:32.300,0:03:33.800
Are you with me?

0:03:33.800,0:03:38.500
Soon, the business failure will come back, because the root is there!

0:03:38.500,0:03:42.100
It's like a stream of water flowing through somewhere.

0:03:42.100,0:03:48.800
And you try to clean up that water, what of where the water is coming from?

0:03:48.860,0:03:53.500
This is the problem of all of us today.

0:03:53.580,0:03:55.700
We never mind the cause of our problem.

0:03:55.720,0:04:00.100
We fight against the problem, but we never mind the cause.

0:04:00.180,0:04:06.300
I was very shocked when the man of God said, 'You are addicted to pornography'.

0:04:06.360,0:04:12.500
He just went straight, exactly to the root cause of my problem.

0:04:12.560,0:04:16.300
This problem started some years back.

0:04:16.340,0:04:19.400
1996, 1995.

0:04:19.440,0:04:23.700
My father told me that I had to go and wash his car.

0:04:23.780,0:04:30.200
Immediately I got inside his car, I found two pornographic magazines.

0:04:30.280,0:04:35.900
I collected those books and hid them inside my bedroom.

0:04:35.980,0:04:45.100
When my father left, I was busy looking at the pornographic pictures of naked women.

0:04:45.160,0:04:54.500
I became addicted to it, each and every day I would make sure to look at those pornographic books.

0:04:54.500,0:05:02.900
From then, 1999-2000, I began to be exposed to video cassettes.

0:05:02.940,0:05:13.100
I would wait for my parents to leave home, then I would be left alone, watching those video cassettes.

0:05:13.140,0:05:19.100
The year 2000, I impregnated a lady.

0:05:19.180,0:05:24.000
That was because of a spirit of lust.

0:05:24.020,0:05:26.460
Fornication was too much.

0:05:26.460,0:05:30.800
I started chasing women.

0:05:30.860,0:05:39.200
From there, the parents of the lady sent her to my house.

0:05:39.280,0:05:43.100
I rejected her, I said I didn't know anything about it.

0:05:43.140,0:05:49.400
After 3 months, they changed the story; they said that I had raped the girl.

0:05:49.420,0:05:54.200
They went to the police station, and I was arrested for a week.

0:05:54.260,0:05:59.900
After they finished investigating the case, they released me.

0:05:59.940,0:06:05.700
By that time I was 16 to 17 years old.

0:06:05.760,0:06:16.300
After they finished investigating the case, they said that they had arrested somebody who was underage.

0:06:16.300,0:06:28.700
From there, from 2000 until 2005, I was afraid to meet with any girl.

0:06:28.780,0:06:35.600
But in 2005 I met my wife. I was doing my final year at the university.

0:06:35.640,0:06:43.000
This problem affected me so much, because there was no affection between me and my wife.

0:06:43.060,0:06:45.700
I kept on lusting after women.

0:06:45.720,0:06:52.100
This problem caused me to have two children outside of the marriage.

0:06:52.140,0:06:54.680
My wife is only aware of one.

0:06:54.680,0:06:57.800
Now, would you listen to that?

0:06:57.800,0:07:05.200
Can you see? Are you listening to that?

0:07:05.220,0:07:13.100
My sister, you know you came here today to solve the problem once and for all.

0:07:13.160,0:07:20.100
No matter what happened, this is a husband God has ordained for you.

0:07:20.100,0:07:24.300
Ok?

0:07:24.300,0:07:29.700
If you are looking for a polished man to marry, are you yourself polished?

0:07:29.720,0:07:34.000
Ask your neighbor, "You are looking for a polished man to marry.

0:07:34.040,0:07:38.200
Are you also polished?"

0:07:38.240,0:07:44.300
You will polish the woman, and the woman will polish you.

0:07:44.340,0:07:46.500
Ask your neighbour,

0:07:46.500,0:07:52.300
"If you are looking for a polished man, a polished woman to marry, are you polished?"

0:07:52.380,0:07:53.900
We need to polish you.

0:07:53.960,0:08:03.600
You are like a shoe that is dirty.

0:08:03.640,0:08:10.400
Because the urge was too much, man of God, I promised to marry another lady and engaged her.

0:08:10.440,0:08:15.880
I married my wife legally, but I have already put the ring on this other woman.

0:08:15.880,0:08:20.800
My wife is not aware that I am already engaged to another woman outside.

0:08:20.820,0:08:24.300
So you have given a ring to a woman?

0:08:24.300,0:08:25.000
Yes.

0:08:25.040,0:08:26.200
Ok.

0:08:26.280,0:08:28.500
Ok.

0:08:28.560,0:08:32.400
I learnt that the sister is here.

0:08:32.420,0:08:34.000
Yes.

0:08:34.020,0:08:38.100
This is why I am telling you that the case is very complicated.

0:08:38.100,0:08:40.380
But God will give us a way

0:08:40.380,0:08:42.900
So, because God wants to restore the marriage...

0:08:42.980,0:08:48.900
The sister that has been given the ring is here already.

0:08:48.980,0:08:50.980
But God will solve the problem.

0:08:50.980,0:08:54.680
So because for the sister to come here it also means she has a heart for God.

0:08:54.680,0:08:56.800
My sister, you listened to that?

0:08:56.800,0:08:58.720
Don't be surprised to hear that.

0:08:58.720,0:09:01.900
Just to make sure everything is alright.

0:09:01.940,0:09:03.100
Ok?

0:09:03.180,0:09:04.900
Ok.

0:09:04.960,0:09:12.800
The same Spirit of God that propelled you to  come here, is the same Spirit of God that propelled that sister

0:09:12.880,0:09:13.520
to be here.

0:09:22.340,0:09:25.700
Should I bring you a seat? Go and bring the seat

0:09:25.720,0:09:27.400
for my sister.

0:09:27.440,0:09:31.000
Not that she is sick, I just want her to sit down.

0:09:31.000,0:09:32.500
Ok?

0:09:36.300,0:09:39.900
I have given a ring to that lady, my wife is not aware.

0:09:39.900,0:09:43.500
I have promised her that once I am back from SCOAN or after India for a massive project

0:09:43.580,0:09:45.900
I would marry her.

0:09:45.960,0:09:51.700
Eh? When?

0:09:51.780,0:09:54.700
I used to beat my wife each and every day.

0:09:54.740,0:09:59.000
When I look at my wife, I don't know what would make me angry.

0:09:59.000,0:10:00.900
I would see my wife as a cheat.

0:10:00.940,0:10:05.300
In fact, I was already 95% outside the marriage already.

0:10:05.340,0:10:10.780
It is alright, it's alright. We don't want to hear, we are here for reconciliation.

0:10:10.780,0:10:15.100
We don't want to hear anything that will not glorify the reconciliation.

0:10:15.100,0:10:17.000
Ok, thank you.

0:10:17.040,0:10:22.700
My sister, please, to settle the marriage and everything, ok?

0:10:22.700,0:10:27.200
I will call the sister out, ok? I hope you don't mind.

0:10:27.220,0:10:28.700
Ok, thank you.

0:10:28.700,0:10:32.600
Thank you.

0:10:32.660,0:10:40.600
The other lady is also not aware that the man is married.

0:10:40.600,0:10:47.100
But this is how you men, you guys

0:10:47.180,0:10:49.660
do deceive people out there.

0:10:49.660,0:10:52.600
So, may God forgive all of you people.

0:10:52.660,0:10:54.000
I can't hear an 'amen.'

0:10:54.080,0:10:55.600
Amen!

0:10:55.680,0:11:00.120
For my sister to be here, you don't need to be told -

0:11:00.120,0:11:08.100
if she was the kind of person that doesn't want to hear God, you would not see her here

0:11:08.140,0:11:10.460
because of the nature of the matter.

0:11:10.460,0:11:13.300
For her to be here, I want to thank you  very much.

0:11:13.380,0:11:15.200
Thank you for coming here.

0:11:15.220,0:11:19.220
And I want to assure you that your situation is my situation.

0:11:19.220,0:11:21.700
Your problem is my problem.

0:11:21.700,0:11:25.140
I will make sure you come here with a great testimony.

0:11:25.640,0:11:27.960
Thank you for honouring the prophet.

0:11:27.960,0:11:32.300
If you honour a prophet because he is a prophet, you receive a prophet's reward.

0:11:32.300,0:11:36.100
Thank you.

0:11:36.140,0:11:39.580
I am convinced that she is sorry

0:11:39.580,0:11:41.400
for what happened.

0:11:41.420,0:11:48.500
I have not heard from her, I am just seeing her for the first time.

0:11:48.540,0:11:55.200
She is very very sorry, she never knew, she cannot be part to a broken home.

0:11:55.220,0:11:56.600
Ok.

0:11:56.680,0:11:57.480
So that is it.

0:11:57.480,0:12:02.500
So please, your ring, you will collect your ring and she will give you your ring.

0:12:02.520,0:12:06.800
Now my sister is not interested.

0:12:06.840,0:12:09.600
So sorry, and sorry, it's over.

0:12:09.600,0:12:13.800
So please, that is it.

0:12:13.840,0:12:14.700
I think I will end the message like that.

0:12:14.740,0:12:17.420
I want to see my sister. Can you take my sister, go and sit down somewhere there?

0:12:17.420,0:12:18.660
I will see her after service.

0:12:18.660,0:12:21.800
You came from South Africa?

0:12:21.800,0:12:23.200
Yes, I came from South Africa.

0:12:23.280,0:12:26.480
Thank you very much, I will take the responsibility. Ok?

0:12:26.480,0:12:27.900
So, go and wait for me.

0:12:27.960,0:12:37.200
Thank you.

0:12:37.220,0:12:43.800
When you have the fear of God, you will do every proper thing to reconcile,

0:12:43.820,0:12:45.700
to say sorry.

0:12:45.700,0:12:49.000
She has the fear of God.

0:12:49.020,0:12:58.600
If God had to share a reward among the three, she would receive the greatest reward.

0:12:58.660,0:13:01.000
Are you with me?

0:13:01.000,0:13:05.100
If God wanted to share a reward among the three people here -

0:13:05.160,0:13:15.260
that lady in red, that you see as the offender, she would receive the greater blessing and greater reward

0:13:15.260,0:13:20.300
for what she has done now.

0:13:20.380,0:13:23.100
So, that is God for you.

0:13:23.160,0:13:28.200
For somebody to actually come from South Africa over this issue...

0:13:28.260,0:13:31.800
And she knew what she was coming here for.

0:13:31.820,0:13:36.140
But the fear is, that ring, she said, "I must see prophet TB Joshua,

0:13:36.140,0:13:42.800
and hand over this ring to prophet TB Joshua, and say I am sorry for what this man has caused".

0:13:42.880,0:13:45.700
Just like that.

0:13:45.780,0:13:48.420
So, are you listening to me? Thank you very much.

0:13:48.420,0:13:51.000
I am happy you are laughing now.

0:13:51.080,0:13:55.300
The old has passed away, every other thing has become new.

0:13:55.380,0:13:59.100
Ok? Can you just say sorry to your wife, whatever you have caused your wife.

0:13:59.140,0:14:01.600
No, no, no, no, don't go down on your knees. Stand up.

0:14:01.600,0:14:05.200
Don't go on your knees.

0:14:05.220,0:14:08.600
I am very sorry, my wife. I am very sorry.

0:14:08.660,0:14:09.900
It's ok.

0:14:09.940,0:14:13.700
Thank you.

0:14:13.720,0:14:15.100
Thank you.

0:14:15.160,0:14:16.400
Thank you.

0:14:16.460,0:14:16.960
Thank you.

0:14:17.180,0:14:19.000
So, I want to meet them, I want to meet them.

0:14:19.080,0:14:21.300
And my sister there, too.

0:14:21.300,0:14:24.800
Ok, I understand what she demonstrated now.

0:14:24.860,0:14:27.180
The sister there.

0:14:27.180,0:14:28.800
So I quite understand her.

0:14:28.840,0:14:31.400
I will not allow her to talk, but I know what is in her mind.

0:14:31.460,0:14:34.200
And I say, madam, can you see?

0:14:34.240,0:14:42.500
If God could go all this way, or go too far to reconcile your marriage...

0:14:42.540,0:14:44.700
So please, give your best to this marriage.

0:14:44.720,0:14:47.200
You are a mother to him.

0:14:47.200,0:14:47.800
Ok?

0:14:47.820,0:14:49.900
You have to tolerate him.

0:14:49.940,0:14:53.400
And he himself also has to tolerate you.

0:14:53.460,0:14:58.100
You are because she is, and she is because you are.

0:14:58.140,0:15:00.300
So, please, where he is weak, you are strong.

0:15:00.380,0:15:02.460
Where he is strong, you are weak.

0:15:02.460,0:15:10.000
Please tolerate each other. Thank you very much.

0:15:10.020,0:15:18.900
So I will meet them, let them go and have their seats.

0:15:18.940,0:15:20.800
I am very sorry to my wife.

0:15:20.880,0:15:27.600
I want to..in fact, as from now,  it's like the first day when we met some years back.

0:15:27.640,0:15:34.800
I love my wife so much. I love her so much, and I am so very sorry, very, very sorry to my wife.

0:15:34.840,0:15:41.900
After my deliverance, the day I saw my wife when she arrived here, I couldn't even help myself.

0:15:41.980,0:15:46.100
I ran to her, I hugged her, I kissed her in front of everyone.

0:15:46.120,0:15:48.400
I love  my wife so much.

0:15:48.460,0:15:53.300
So much. I love you, my wife.

0:15:53.320,0:15:56.900
I love  you.

0:15:56.940,0:16:01.300
I am very sorry, my wife, I am so sorry. Please forgive me.

0:16:01.320,0:16:03.100
I forgive you. Please.

0:16:03.160,0:16:04.000
I love you.

0:16:04.040,0:16:11.600
After my deliverance recently, that very same day I felt like there is something which went out of my middle finger,

0:16:11.680,0:16:15.600
middle finger, like somebody had put a ring on it; that ring came off.

0:16:15.680,0:16:24.000
In my dreams I am no longer seeing the spiritual wife, or ladies on the queue to sleep with me in my dreams.

0:16:24.080,0:16:26.200
I love my wife so much.

0:16:26.200,0:16:32.000
I am no longer interested in seeing naked women, I love my wife.

0:16:32.040,0:16:36.100
I am delivered. I am free from those spirits of pornography.

0:16:36.160,0:16:40.100
I thank God because the devil is out of my marriage,

0:16:40.160,0:16:42.300
the devil is out of my family,

0:16:42.340,0:16:44.100
the devil is out of my life,

0:16:44.100,0:16:45.500
the devil is out of my business.

0:16:45.540,0:16:47.300
Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:47.340,0:16:56.700
I want to thank God, because this thing was tormenting me so much. I was crying each and every day.

0:16:56.720,0:17:01.440
For I was praying each and every day that He would locate this problem.

0:17:01.440,0:17:05.900
But I thank God because He located it, and my problem is over.

0:17:05.960,0:17:09.700
My pain has passed away, I thank You, Lord.

0:17:09.760,0:17:15.200
And I thank God because He used prophet TB Joshua to deliver my husband.

0:17:15.280,0:17:19.100
Now he is a good husband and a lovely one.

0:17:19.100,0:17:24.180
I feel so great because my husband loves me so much

0:17:24.180,0:17:28.660
after the deliverance. When I came here on Saturday, I was surprised

0:17:28.660,0:17:33.140
because my husband came to me quickly and hugged me, and kissed me.

0:17:33.140,0:17:37.600
I was not expecting such a thing because he doesn't do this.

0:17:37.680,0:17:41.500
I thank You, Jesus, because You delivered my husband.

0:17:41.540,0:17:51.100
I feel like it's the beginning of this marriage; and I thank God because we are starting a new relationship.

0:17:51.160,0:17:52.440
I love you so much.

0:17:52.440,0:17:54.900
I love you, too.

0:17:54.920,0:17:58.300
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

0:17:58.320,0:18:00.640
I have forgiven you, my husband.

0:18:00.660,0:18:09.000
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

0:18:09.040,0:18:14.480
Association brings assimilation. I have associated myself with pornography

0:18:14.480,0:18:20.400
and behaved like  the characters in pornography films or the sex workers.

0:18:20.460,0:18:29.500
My advice is this, if you have made a mistake as we all do, don't run away from God; run to Him.

0:18:29.520,0:18:30.800
Thank You, Jesus.

0:18:30.800,0:18:35.140
The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B.Joshua, with Emmanuel TV partners all over the world,

0:18:35.140,0:18:43.300
have realized the need to also help you financially, also the Man of God said we should give you

0:18:43.300,0:18:49.380
a sum of $1,000 to assist you back home and also enable you and your wife to remain at peace.

0:18:49.380,0:18:58.400
We thank God. Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Jesus for using the Man of God to bless my marriage.

0:18:58.400,0:19:07.400
Thank You, Jesus. I've never expected that the Man of God would bless me with such a huge amount.

0:19:07.480,0:19:13.640
Glory be to God. This is the only ministry which I know that when you come here - you can never

0:19:13.640,0:19:26.100
go back the same. I thank God. Apart from delivering me and restoring my marriage

0:19:26.180,0:19:30.580
man of God blessed me with a sum of $1,000. I've never expected this.

0:19:30.580,0:19:33.200
God bless this ministry and God bless the Man of God, Senior Prophet T.B Joshua.

0:19:33.220,0:19:34.500
Thank You, Jesus.

0:19:34.500,0:19:36.500
My name is Mahada Shunsani.

0:19:36.500,0:19:37.880
I'm from South Africa.

0:19:37.880,0:19:43.260
I am a senior accounting clerk; that is a cashier supervisor.

0:19:43.260,0:19:49.380
Last Sunday, the man of God invited me and I came here to the SCOAN.

0:19:49.380,0:19:54.340
That was after I saw the deliverance of the guy I was dating, called Oscar.

0:19:54.340,0:19:57.880
He was being delivered that Sunday which was the man of God's birthday.

0:19:57.880,0:20:01.840
When I was watching Emmanuel TV at home, I saw him being delivered.

0:20:01.840,0:20:09.460
Then the man of God said he was addicted to pornography and it had destroyed his marriage.

0:20:09.460,0:20:17.640
As I was one of the girls he was dating, I felt in my heart that I maybe was one of the major causes

0:20:17.640,0:20:20.820
or people who had broken their marriage.

0:20:20.820,0:20:26.960
We were dating. He proposed to me and gave me an engagement ring.

0:20:26.960,0:20:33.900
As the man of God was prophesying, I realised that what I was doing was wrong.

0:20:33.900,0:20:39.900
Within the week, I got an invitation from the man of God to come to The SCOAN.

0:20:39.900,0:20:45.200
I found out in my heart to say this was my chance as I knew I also needed to be delivered

0:20:45.200,0:20:50.080
and what I was doing was wrong. I could not stand to see me destroying someone's marriage

0:20:50.080,0:20:54.360
because if it happened to me, I would not like it.

0:20:54.360,0:20:58.760
When the man of God called me to come here, I found it worrying.

0:20:58.760,0:21:03.260
Even though it took me time to be with him, I knew it would cause my life to be unhappy.

0:21:03.260,0:21:11.660
I had to come here for my own deliverance, so I would get my own husband, family and home.

0:21:11.660,0:21:18.400
When I was watching Emmanuel TV that very Sunday when Brother Oscar was delivered,

0:21:18.400,0:21:25.700
Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke about love and offence, just like the message he preached last week.

0:21:25.700,0:21:36.940
Then, I felt it in my heart that I had offended his wife and abused her emotionally.

0:21:36.940,0:21:43.280
When the man of God was talking about love and offence, I said to myself that there was no way

0:21:43.280,0:21:48.360
I could say I was praying and expect God to hear when I was still offending her.

0:21:48.360,0:21:56.620
I then felt I should tell her that I love her from my heart and put myself in her shoes.

0:21:56.620,0:22:03.760
If I were in her shoes and this happened to me, what would I do? Would I be happy with that?

0:22:03.760,0:22:13.700
After the man of God spoke about offence and love, I decided to take this chance.

0:22:13.700,0:22:23.320
On that Sunday, I sent her a text message and asked her to forgive me.

0:22:23.320,0:22:30.420
I asked her to find a place in her heart to forgive me because I knew I had offended her.

0:22:30.420,0:22:38.120
When the man of God invited me, I couldn't wait. I wanted to fly the same moment I got the call.

0:22:38.120,0:22:44.740
I was so happy, knowing I was going to get my own portion of deliverance

0:22:44.740,0:22:49.460
and have a chance to say sorry to her in a way she would understand.

0:22:49.460,0:22:57.100
When the man of God called me out, I felt honoured

0:22:57.100,0:23:04.680
and introduced myself as the woman Oscar had engaged.

0:23:04.680,0:23:15.740
As the man of God talked to me and held my hand, I couldn't think of anything else.

0:23:15.740,0:23:22.260
I felt peace from there and knew that this is what I wanted - to be out of this relationship.

0:23:22.260,0:23:27.960
I had been struggling for long but this was my opportunity and time to be delivered.

0:23:27.960,0:23:37.060
I felt peace when he talked to us and told his wife that this was her husband from God.

0:23:37.060,0:23:47.160
When he told me God would provide my own man, I felt so peaceful, released and free.

0:23:47.160,0:23:56.620
When he called me to his office and I met him, he prayed for me

0:23:56.620,0:24:06.360
I just felt free. I felt that urge and desire to leave me.

0:24:06.360,0:24:12.960
When he prayed for me, I collapsed, vomitted and then afterwards felt free.

0:24:12.960,0:24:19.860
It felt like something came out of me; I felt so relieved and free.

0:24:19.860,0:24:27.020
I realised after he prayed for me that what I was doing was wrong.

0:24:27.020,0:24:31.780
I could not be in love with someone who is married and break someone's house.

0:24:31.780,0:24:37.820
I felt free after that and I know I am delivered for good.

0:24:37.820,0:24:42.640
Currently, I just want to say I am sorry to his wife.

0:24:42.640,0:24:47.120
I know I abused her emotionally because she knew of our relationship

0:24:47.120,0:24:51.780
but didn't know what to do about it because we kept going back to each other.

0:24:51.780,0:25:01.160
So, I want to say sorry to his wife and give back the ring to Oscar to say I don't need it anymore.

0:25:01.160,0:25:08.040
I know I will have my own portion, so I want to give the ring back and say sorry to his wife.

0:25:08.040,0:25:14.620
What I can say to the ladies out there is that God's delay is not God's denial.

0:25:14.620,0:25:21.480
Learn to be patient. I have realised I should have been patient and wait for my own husband.

0:25:21.480,0:25:26.940
So, be strong and wait for the Lord's time because God's time is the best.

0:25:26.940,0:25:29.640
God's delay is not God's denial.

0:25:29.640,0:25:33.600
The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, in his usual kind gesture

0:25:33.600,0:25:37.620
knows fully well that we wouldn't want you to go just like that.

0:25:37.620,0:25:43.740
He also said he would like to bless you with the sum of $1.000 to assist you back home.

0:25:43.740,0:25:49.380
This is from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.

0:25:49.380,0:26:04.220
I thank you very much for this gift I just received from the man of God.

0:26:04.220,0:26:09.980
I am very grateful and thankful. Thank you very much. You have honoured me a lot.

0:26:09.980,0:26:15.240
May God richly bless you. I thank God and I thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:26:15.240,0:26:20.020
The man of God has done this for me; I really don't know how to express myself.

0:26:20.020,0:26:28.760
I was not expecting this gift or anything except for me to confess and be prayed for.

0:26:28.760,0:26:38.740
Now, I have received deliverance, peace of heart, this gift of $1.000 and The Mirror book.

0:26:38.740,0:26:42.720
It's a lot to me and I am very thankful and grateful.

0:26:42.720,0:26:48.740
I just want to say I am sorry to them and give them their ring.

0:26:48.740,0:27:09.100
Reconciliation Testimony

0:27:09.100,0:27:14.500
Now, I want to say this to Oscar. I am bringing this ring in peace.

0:27:14.500,0:27:21.000
Now the man of God has delivered you and told you that your marriage is from God,

0:27:21.000,0:27:25.100
I believe it and I am bringing this ring in peace.

0:27:25.100,0:27:32.360
I would like to advise you to have your house in order and enjoy your marriage.

0:27:32.360,0:27:37.820
May you and your wife please find it in your hearts to forgive me

0:27:37.820,0:27:42.140
as I am bringing this ring back to you.

0:27:42.140,0:27:48.040
I forgive you and I am very sorry. I also ask you to forgive me.

0:27:48.040,0:27:58.980
It was not myself but the spirit of pornography which was pushing me.

0:27:58.980,0:28:06.700
I was being tormented by the spirit of lust and fornication.

0:28:06.700,0:28:11.220
I am very sorry for wasting your time.

0:28:11.220,0:28:16.080
After my deliverance, I realised that what I was doing was totally wrong.

0:28:16.080,0:28:21.240
I want to let you know that God loves you more than the way I love you

0:28:21.240,0:28:23.260
and I wish you the best.

0:28:23.260,0:28:27.640
May God bless you as you have your future partner, in Jesus' name.

I just want to say to you that I am very sorry.

0:28:34.180,0:28:36.560
I know I abused you emotionally.

0:28:36.560,0:28:39.340
I know that what you were going through was not good.

0:28:39.340,0:28:42.180
I have realised that what I was doing was wrong.

0:28:42.180,0:28:45.800
Now that I am delivered, may you please forgive me.

0:28:45.800,0:28:49.080
May you please find it in your heart.
