0:00:00.000,0:00:03.860
There is a brother there, you have a new woman.

0:00:03.860,0:00:07.240
You love your woman - a very kind woman -

0:00:07.240,0:00:13.200
but mistakenly, you found yourself getting married to somebody outside

0:00:13.200,0:00:19.800
and you have rented a secret place - a bedroom flat somewhere.

0:00:19.800,0:00:24.500
You have now begun to manage your time - sometimes you sleep here, another time, there.

0:00:24.500,0:00:29.580
We are just telling you - this coming year, you cannot continue it.

0:00:29.580,0:00:32.000
It will be very dangerous for you.

0:00:32.000,0:00:34.480
Come out for your deliverance.

0:00:34.480,0:00:37.940
The brother I am talking about, please come out.

0:00:37.940,0:00:41.820
In confirmation of the prophecy, a man comes out of the congregation

0:00:41.820,0:00:44.900
and walks towards Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:00:44.900,0:00:46.800
Are you not too young?

0:00:46.800,0:00:47.840
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:47.840,0:00:49.840
I am confused.

0:00:49.840,0:00:50.880
You are confused?

0:00:50.880,0:00:51.940
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:51.940,0:00:52.840
You are confused?

0:00:52.840,0:00:53.680
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:53.680,0:00:55.860
But this one is never confused!

0:00:55.860,0:00:59.820
Prophecy Time

0:00:59.820,0:01:03.340
If you are confused, this one will never be confused.

0:01:03.340,0:01:08.100
He said, I am confused.

0:01:08.100,0:01:11.360
If you are confused, can that place be confused?

0:01:11.360,0:01:12.660
I can't hear you.

0:01:12.660,0:01:14.140
[No!]

0:01:14.140,0:01:20.780
It is him that is confused but that place is a different place.

0:01:20.780,0:01:29.240
Next year, what you are doing secretly now - if you try it next year, you will die.

0:01:29.240,0:01:36.960
Because the woman you put in that place, they are tracing you and they will get you.

0:01:36.960,0:01:40.100
Very early in the morning, they will just find that they have killed you somewhere.

0:01:40.100,0:01:44.840
So, by the time you go to the other one, you will know you are confused.

0:01:44.840,0:01:50.600
He is a young man. You are very handsome; please don't let this world deceive you.

0:01:50.600,0:01:52.620
Okay? So, I want to see you.

0:01:52.620,0:01:54.720
Thank you, Man of God.

0:01:54.720,0:01:58.800
What has your real wife done to you?

0:01:58.800,0:02:01.320
Nothing, Man of God.

0:02:01.320,0:02:03.840
I will invite her.

0:02:03.840,0:02:05.700
How old are you?

0:02:05.700,0:02:07.700
Thirty-six years.

0:02:07.700,0:02:09.400
Okay, wait for me.

0:02:09.400,0:02:11.900
The other one, I will invite her.

0:02:11.900,0:02:16.080
We will pray with her and point her to her future success

0:02:16.080,0:02:18.080
and I will say, 'Please, leave my brother'.

0:02:18.080,0:02:23.980
All we are saying, leave my brother.

0:02:23.980,0:02:30.660
Prophecy Time

0:02:30.660,0:02:35.820
The woman is not confused; this man is confused.

0:02:35.820,0:02:39.120
So, the one who is not confused should be able to tell the one who is,

0:02:39.120,0:02:41.740
"Please, go back to where you are coming from".

0:02:43.020,0:02:47.400
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:02:47.400,0:02:48.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:48.720,0:02:54.480
These are the issues you will never ask the man of God to pray for you.

0:02:54.480,0:03:00.260
You will leave the important issue - you would be telling the man of God a different thing.

0:03:00.260,0:03:03.800
This is why we are here. Anything that could be dangerous for you,

0:03:03.800,0:03:08.280
you want Jesus to bring it and separate you from them.

0:03:08.280,0:03:12.140
I said he should bring the wife at home

0:03:12.140,0:03:17.560
and the wife at home is maybe hearing this for the first time.

0:03:17.560,0:03:21.360
My name is Mr Emmanuel.

0:03:21.360,0:03:23.860
I am from Togo.

0:03:23.860,0:03:29.140
The woman beside me is my wife, which I'm wedded with.

0:03:29.140,0:03:35.280
During the prophetic service on Saturday, the man of God prophesied

0:03:35.280,0:03:38.540
that there was a young man here who was married

0:03:38.540,0:03:43.480
but had secretly rented a house for another woman outside.

0:03:43.480,0:03:49.480
Immediately I heard it, I found it difficult to come out.

0:03:49.480,0:03:53.640
I waiting to see if someone else would come out.

0:03:53.640,0:04:00.660
Suddenly, it felt like there was a vibrating machine inside me.

0:04:00.660,0:04:06.060
My body could not be controlled any longer; everything was vibrating seriously.

0:04:06.060,0:04:07.900
Did you listen to that?

0:04:07.900,0:04:14.160
He said that when I was saying it, he was looking for someone to come out.

0:04:14.160,0:04:17.000
But before he finished looking round the church -

0:04:17.000,0:04:22.120
he looked at this side of the church but before he looked back,

0:04:22.120,0:04:24.580
something hit his heart.

0:04:24.580,0:04:26.920
You know Jesus loves you.

0:04:26.920,0:04:29.060
He has a way of taking you.

0:04:29.060,0:04:31.300
I mean, He is your Creator.

0:04:31.300,0:04:34.520
He said he could not breathe again.

0:04:34.520,0:04:37.040
He had to quickly come out.

0:04:37.040,0:04:40.520
I looked around but didn't see anyone else coming out.

0:04:40.520,0:04:48.540
At the time my body started vibrating, I started hearing, "Pack your things and run".

0:04:48.540,0:04:52.360
I don't know how I got to the front of the altar.

0:04:52.360,0:04:56.420
Everything the man of God said is completely true - one hundred percent true.

0:04:56.420,0:05:01.980
A woman was introduced to me by a friend who supplied sand to us.

0:05:01.980,0:05:04.500
She already had six children.

0:05:04.500,0:05:06.960
I was helping them.

0:05:06.960,0:05:14.420
One day, she discussed with me that as I was helping them,

0:05:14.420,0:05:19.060
she wanted to have a child with me which would be a point of contact between us

0:05:19.060,0:05:22.360
when I left the country.

0:05:22.360,0:05:26.400
I told her that if we did that, it could cause a problem for me

0:05:26.400,0:05:28.700
because I was a foreigner in the country.

0:05:28.700,0:05:32.060
She said I should know how to control the issue.

0:05:32.060,0:05:38.660
Finally, I started having an affair with her.

0:05:38.660,0:05:43.200
She then got pregnant and had a child for me.

0:05:43.200,0:05:45.540
My wife doesn't know anything of what I am saying now.

0:05:45.540,0:05:48.260
This is her first time of hearing all of these things.

0:05:48.260,0:05:51.100
So, this is the first time your wife is hearing this from you?

0:05:51.100,0:05:53.520
Yes, Man of God.

0:05:53.520,0:06:00.320
She suspected me but I was not in a position to say anything to her.

0:06:00.320,0:06:05.080
That woman used the child to threaten me.

0:06:05.080,0:06:07.080
Whenever she asked for something

0:06:07.080,0:06:11.080
or asked me to come to her house, which I didn't want to do,

0:06:11.080,0:06:16.600
she would say she would carry her child - my child, and drop it at my house.

0:06:16.600,0:06:18.920
The woman is a family friend

0:06:18.920,0:06:23.640
but I didn't want anything that would cause a problem between me and my wife.

0:06:23.640,0:06:29.700
My wife took her as a sister and always did her hair for her.

0:06:29.700,0:06:36.140
During our wedding, she was with us and helped us with everything we were doing.

0:06:36.140,0:06:39.340
My wife thought she was my sister.

0:06:39.340,0:06:43.380
Ok. Madam, how are you?

0:06:43.380,0:06:47.200
You should thank God; you should not be disturbed.

0:06:47.200,0:06:51.320
It is the time now God wants to fortify this marriage.

0:06:51.320,0:06:56.360
If there is no marriage between you and him, I would let you know.

0:06:56.360,0:07:02.000
I see this is a relationship from God; this is a marriage from God.

0:07:02.000,0:07:09.440
No matter the case, like Apostle Paul said, "What can separate me from the love of Christ".

0:07:09.440,0:07:16.500
Whatever happened, don't worry.

0:07:16.500,0:07:19.140
So, for you to know that he is not fit.

0:07:19.140,0:07:21.020
Do you know the woman he is talking about?

0:07:21.020,0:07:23.360
Yes.

0:07:23.360,0:07:31.120
I know the woman; she is like a sister, a family friend to me.

0:07:31.120,0:07:39.500
During our wedding, she organised her own committee of friends

0:07:39.500,0:07:42.440
and did her own committee of friends personally

0:07:42.440,0:07:45.980
because we were close together.

0:07:45.980,0:07:49.700
She is like a sister and family friend to us.

0:07:49.700,0:07:54.400
She has six children already.

0:07:54.400,0:07:57.980
The seventh one - I thought it was the woman's son.

0:07:57.980,0:08:02.980
I didn't know the seventh one is my husband's son.

0:08:02.980,0:08:07.080
I am here; I am confused and don't know what to do.

0:08:07.080,0:08:08.680
Please.

0:08:08.680,0:08:11.020
Are you hearing it for the first time now?

0:08:11.020,0:08:14.080
Yes, this is my first time to hear this.

0:08:14.080,0:08:16.080
Ok, it's alright.

0:08:16.080,0:08:18.020
I think the woman is around?

0:08:18.020,0:08:20.740
Yes, Man of God.

0:08:20.740,0:08:27.680
Because she is ... Madam, why are you panting?

0:08:27.680,0:08:29.020
It's alright.

0:08:29.020,0:08:34.620
So, I'm the one who said they should bring the woman.

0:08:34.620,0:08:38.600
She never knew you would be here; she never knew it would be like this.

0:08:38.600,0:08:43.120
Maybe, she probably thought I want to cement their marriage.

0:08:43.120,0:08:45.120
Ok, it's alright.

0:08:45.120,0:08:49.440
Madam, don't worry. After the service, I need to see the family.

0:08:49.440,0:08:54.540
But simple, viewers - what I want to see them for is simple.

0:08:54.540,0:08:57.940
Next Sunday, they will come out to give testimony.

0:08:57.940,0:08:59.560
This is your wife.

0:08:59.560,0:09:01.360
Okay?

0:09:01.360,0:09:02.860
I will...

0:09:02.860,0:09:16.540
Mr & Mrs Emmanuel - Prophecy Confirmation

0:09:16.540,0:09:18.760
Please forgive me.

0:09:18.760,0:09:20.400
Ok, it's alright.

0:09:20.400,0:09:25.200
So, I will meet the other woman, and I will talk to her.

0:09:25.200,0:09:27.460
But one thing is clear.

0:09:27.460,0:09:31.460
That child is this family's child.

0:09:31.460,0:09:34.500
You cannot reject him; he is your husband's child.

0:09:34.500,0:09:41.560
But she will leave your marriage and God will forgive your husband and forgive her.

0:09:41.560,0:09:44.600
The child belongs to this family. Okay?

0:09:44.600,0:09:49.120
But I want to assure you, this marriage is yours.

0:09:49.120,0:09:53.540
I will let you see the reason why you can't leave the marriage.

0:09:53.540,0:09:57.880
You will begin to enjoy the joy of this marriage from now on.

0:09:57.880,0:10:00.040
Okay? I will be meeting you people.

0:10:00.040,0:10:01.740
So, the woman should wait.

0:10:01.740,0:10:05.800
Thank you. The evangelists will meet the woman, entertain her

0:10:05.800,0:10:09.200
and give her a place to sit. She should not run away.

0:10:09.200,0:10:10.840
Madam, give me your hand.

0:10:10.840,0:10:13.020
Did you listen to me?

0:10:13.020,0:10:15.120
Ok, it's alright. I will see you.

0:10:15.120,0:10:17.020
Ok, go and wait for me.

0:10:17.020,0:10:19.420
Mr & Mrs Emmanuel - Prophecy Confirmation

0:10:19.420,0:10:24.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:24.480,0:10:28.560
I know it doesn't mean anything to many of us here.

0:10:28.560,0:10:34.640
Some would just laugh over there and say, "Ah, see o!"

0:10:34.640,0:10:41.900
The day God will catch up with you, you will know it means a lot!

0:10:41.900,0:10:50.300
Some say, "Hehe! No problem".

0:10:50.300,0:10:53.900
The day God will catch up with you!

0:10:53.900,0:10:55.900
Ok. So, thank you.

0:10:55.900,0:10:57.940
I will personally see the woman and settle the matter.

0:10:57.940,0:11:03.900
The woman will go for deliverance today, prayer today, and she will quit the marriage.

0:11:03.900,0:11:09.880
We don't want them to just quit the marriage with disagreement and hatred.

0:11:09.880,0:11:16.080
To quit this kind of relationship, the whole thing will be to understand both sides,.

0:11:16.080,0:11:19.300
and this man can continue --

0:11:19.300,0:11:24.080
I know for many of you, you see it differently.

0:11:24.080,0:11:30.900
Sometimes, God can speak good through the bad.

0:11:30.900,0:11:32.140
That is God for you.

0:11:32.140,0:11:36.420
I know many of you, because of this, you quit the marriage.

0:11:36.420,0:11:41.240
A lot of marriages - there are many people here who quit their marriage

0:11:41.240,0:11:44.360
because of what happened - that kind of thing.

0:11:44.360,0:11:48.600
But today, have you got the right marriage now?

0:11:48.600,0:11:53.600
Whatever happens, examine it in the light of God.

0:11:53.600,0:11:58.880
Anything that happens in your marriage, ask God what He says about it.

0:11:58.880,0:12:03.360
In every situation, what does He say?

0:12:03.360,0:12:10.600
The answer is not to quit but the first thing is to ask God His mind -

0:12:10.600,0:12:14.540
what is His opinion, His suggestion concerning what happened -

0:12:14.540,0:12:18.600
before you think of either quitting or staying.

0:12:18.600,0:12:23.560
When something happens, no matter how big, what does He say.

0:12:23.560,0:12:28.760
In every situation, God has something to say.

0:12:28.760,0:12:31.540
So, we don't just quit anything -

0:12:31.540,0:12:36.460
either marriage, relationship, business partnership or whatever -

0:12:36.460,0:12:38.440
whatever relationship at all.

0:12:38.440,0:12:39.820
No matter what happened.

0:12:39.820,0:12:46.920
If God first brought this relationship, it is the same God that will release you and release him,

0:12:46.920,0:12:49.620
not crisis, not situation.

0:12:49.620,0:12:55.760
We should not because of situation release ourselves or quit the relationship.

0:12:55.760,0:12:59.120
No matter the situation, what does He have to say

0:12:59.120,0:13:04.040
because He is the Father of the relationship.

0:13:04.040,0:13:11.780
If not, you will leave this relationship and meet someone who has quit a relationship because of trouble.

0:13:11.780,0:13:13.380
The two of you will meet.

0:13:13.380,0:13:15.520
You quit the relationship because of trouble

0:13:15.520,0:13:18.660
and you meet someone who quit a relationship because of trouble.

0:13:18.660,0:13:22.040
Two of you - two troubles will meet.

0:13:22.040,0:13:26.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:26.720,0:13:34.120
If you quit this relationship because of trouble - either embarassment, betrayal or whatever -

0:13:34.120,0:13:46.040
and you quit, where will you get someone who has not quit a relationship before because of trouble?

0:13:46.040,0:13:50.420
If you quit this relationship without healing,

0:13:50.420,0:13:54.600
you will meet someone who quit a relationship without healing.

0:13:54.600,0:13:57.580
The two of you will meet.

0:13:57.580,0:14:02.480
The way you quit this relationship is the way you will meet the new relationship.

0:14:02.480,0:14:07.500
So much of the trouble we have today is because of the relationships we quit every day.

0:14:07.500,0:14:15.920
Business partner, marriage, friend - the way you quit them -

0:14:15.920,0:14:18.300
you just quit a relationship.

0:14:18.300,0:14:28.600
The person who is a criminal or is bad today, may be a messiah tomorrow, if you endure.

0:14:28.600,0:14:36.780
We have seen a person who you say betrayed you, disappointed you,

0:14:36.780,0:14:39.820
and you quit and leave him.

0:14:39.820,0:14:48.240
Now later, it is the same person you will meet in the future that stands to be your saviour.

0:14:48.240,0:14:51.060
You now say, "Ah!"

0:14:51.060,0:14:53.760
Life is just like that.

0:14:53.760,0:14:57.580
God owns our future. You don't know what the future holds.

0:14:57.580,0:15:06.240
The bad today can be the best tomorrow and the best today can be bad tomorrow.

0:15:06.240,0:15:09.960
The criminal today can be the saviour tomorrow.

0:15:09.960,0:15:14.060
A dishonest person can be trustworthy tomorrow.

0:15:14.060,0:15:16.940
I mean, life is just like that.

0:15:16.940,0:15:22.320
After the reconciliation with the family, Mr Emmanuel came back two weeks later

0:15:22.320,0:15:26.080
to testify of how God redeemed his marriage.

0:15:26.080,0:15:27.580
Let's listen to him.

0:15:27.580,0:15:31.620
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:15:31.620,0:15:35.180
My name is Mr Emmanuel.

0:15:35.180,0:15:36.740
I am from Togo.

0:15:36.740,0:15:38.980
The woman beside me is my wife.

0:15:38.980,0:15:43.220
I am married to a Nigerian; she is from Ebonyi State (Nigeria).

0:15:43.220,0:15:52.400
During the prophetic service on 10th December, the man of God prophesied that there is a man

0:15:52.400,0:15:57.920
here who secretly rented a house for another woman outside, who is me.

0:15:57.920,0:16:00.080
Today, we thank God.

0:16:00.080,0:16:09.300
After that, the man of God saw us, reconciled the family, counselled us and settled everything.

0:16:09.300,0:16:12.300
Now, I have received my child.

0:16:12.300,0:16:18.320
The child belongs to my wife and she will call my wife 'mother'.

0:16:18.320,0:16:25.580
I want to thank the man of God for him to allow himself to be used by God to settle this case.

0:16:25.580,0:16:28.280
Before I came here, I was like a man who was half dead.

0:16:28.280,0:16:30.960
I could not sleep. I did not have peace.

0:16:30.960,0:16:35.900
But since then, I can sleep; sometimes, my wife would be the one to wake me.

0:16:35.900,0:16:39.860
Before, I could wake up more than six times during the night.

0:16:39.860,0:16:44.000
Now, the love is different from before.

0:16:44.000,0:16:49.160
Now, we are living better than before, I know that this is the beginning of the wedding.

0:16:49.160,0:16:50.260
Thank you.

0:16:50.260,0:16:53.940
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:16:53.940,0:17:00.700
That is a testimony after the prophecy and prayer by the man of God.

0:17:00.700,0:17:06.060
After meeting the family, he said his life is settled once again.

0:17:06.060,0:17:10.840
Before now, he was confused, restless; everthing was upside down.

0:17:10.840,0:17:12.940
There was no peace in his heart.

0:17:12.940,0:17:15.380
But now, there is peace.

0:17:15.380,0:17:19.840
The right knowledge of God has settled peace in the family.

0:17:19.840,0:17:22.080
So, let's hear from madam.

0:17:22.080,0:17:26.700
Mr Emmanuel & Wife - Reconciliation Testimony

0:17:26.700,0:17:29.800
My name is Mrs Chika.

0:17:29.800,0:17:32.960
I am a Nigerian, married to a Togolese.

0:17:32.960,0:17:37.120
The man beside me is my husband.

0:17:37.120,0:17:42.460
I am here to thank God for what He has done in our lives

0:17:42.460,0:17:49.480
through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for restoring our marriage and family.

0:17:49.480,0:17:51.480
I am here to thank God.

0:17:51.480,0:17:56.220
We are happy; the man of God has settled and counselled us.

0:17:56.220,0:17:59.600
We are happy. We are here to thank God for that.

0:17:59.600,0:18:02.320
Amen.

0:18:02.320,0:18:06.280
Have you also forgiven your husband from your heart?

0:18:06.280,0:18:12.220
Yes, I have forgiven my husband, and I am ready to take the child as mine.

0:18:12.220,0:18:17.560
Amen. Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

0:18:17.560,0:18:25.700
I don't have anything to say more than thank you because I didn't know a day like this would come.

0:18:25.700,0:18:31.100
Now, I love my wife more than before.

0:18:31.100,0:18:35.680
To my greatest surprise, she accepted the child as her own.

0:18:35.680,0:18:38.660
I thank God for everything.

0:18:38.660,0:18:42.080
I thank God Almighty, in Jesus' name.

0:18:42.080,0:18:48.680
Thank You, Jesus. Let's clap for Jesus one more time!

0:18:48.680,0:18:55.160
So, Madam, regarding this issue, can you tell us - you met with the man of God,

0:18:55.160,0:18:59.240
and the man of God through the power of the Holy Spirit has intervened in this matter --

0:18:59.240,0:19:02.420
We met with the man of God.

0:19:02.420,0:19:07.100
The man of God prophesied to me that I'm going to have my own baby.

0:19:07.100,0:19:12.160
So, I'm happy. I'm ready to take the child as mine.

0:19:12.160,0:19:15.340
Amen. Glory be to God! So, you could hear that.

0:19:15.340,0:19:18.720
The man of God also released a prophetic word to her

0:19:18.720,0:19:23.900
that now, as she prepares to take this child as her own child,

0:19:23.900,0:19:28.460
that God will through that act bless her.

0:19:28.460,0:19:31.340
She is coming back to also testify about that.

0:19:31.340,0:19:38.080
We believe that it shall be according to as God has spoken, in Jesus' name.

0:19:38.080,0:19:43.300
So, right now, without further ado, we'd like to invite the lady -

0:19:43.300,0:19:47.460
the child's mother - into our midst.

0:19:47.460,0:19:54.320
True to her word, Mrs Chika lovingly accepts the little child as her own biological child.

0:19:54.320,0:20:00.680
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:00.680,0:20:08.220
Just as she was divinely advised by the man of God and also promised to comply,

0:20:08.220,0:20:14.560
the madam has taken the child from the biological mother

0:20:14.560,0:20:19.320
and has accepted to take the child as her own child.

0:20:19.320,0:20:24.640
This is my son from now, and I'm happy.

0:20:24.640,0:20:30.700
Let us clap for Jesus!

0:20:30.700,0:20:33.640
Thank you. God bless you.

0:20:33.640,0:20:37.100
Madam, we thank God Almighty for everything.

0:20:37.100,0:20:41.700
We believe, having been invited here over this issue,

0:20:41.700,0:20:46.720
and God has intervened in this matter, what do you have to say?

0:20:46.720,0:20:49.560
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:20:49.560,0:20:52.220
My name is Mrs Charity.

0:20:52.220,0:20:56.160
I'm from Ebonyi State.

0:20:56.160,0:20:58.160
Okay.

0:20:58.160,0:21:04.740
I thank God for today.

0:21:04.740,0:21:10.780
I'm here to apologise to my sister

0:21:10.780,0:21:14.620
and hand over the child to the family

0:21:14.620,0:21:21.060
so that the wife will take care of the child.

0:21:21.060,0:21:22.820
I'm grateful.

0:21:22.820,0:21:32.520
I also thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for revealing it.

0:21:32.520,0:21:34.520
I really thank God.

0:21:34.520,0:21:45.220
I also ask her to forgive me and forget.

0:21:45.220,0:21:49.720
Ok, you have heard it all. Glory be to God in the highest!

0:21:49.720,0:21:56.360
Hallelujah! Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

0:21:56.360,0:22:00.400
So, madam, you have heard from the sister.

0:22:00.400,0:22:04.320
She is apologising for all that happened in the past.

0:22:04.320,0:22:09.460
We all know that all men make mistakes but mistakes are correctable.

0:22:09.460,0:22:14.060
By the grace of God, all the mistakes of the past have been corrected today,

0:22:14.060,0:22:18.060
and as she has spoken, what is your response, madam?

0:22:18.060,0:22:23.100
I have forgiven her .

0:22:23.100,0:22:25.000
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:22:25.000,0:22:28.520
I have forgiven you.

0:22:28.520,0:22:32.040
Thank you. God bless you.

0:22:32.040,0:22:37.820
Now that this marriage has been sustained,

0:22:37.820,0:22:43.500
and God Almighty has restored this marriage,

0:22:43.500,0:22:47.440
what could have broken the marriage  
 in the past

0:22:47.440,0:22:49.960
the Lord Almighty has taken care,

0:22:49.960,0:22:54.980
and today, the marriage has been cemented, even closer than ever before.

0:22:54.980,0:23:01.520
Madam, now that you have taken up this responsibility to take care of this child,

0:23:01.520,0:23:05.620
we also want to encourage you to do that faithfully,

0:23:05.620,0:23:11.600
knowing fully well that you are looking upon the face of God for your own blessing.

0:23:11.600,0:23:17.340
And as you take care of this child, as advised by the man of God himself,

0:23:17.340,0:23:19.600
this blessing will come speedily

0:23:19.600,0:23:23.960
and very soon you are coming back with your own child

0:23:23.960,0:23:28.400
to testify to the goodness of God, in Jesus' name.

0:23:28.400,0:23:33.600
So, as from today, you have said that you have now become the mother of the boy,

0:23:33.600,0:23:40.280
and we also thank you for listening to the words of the anointed man of God.
