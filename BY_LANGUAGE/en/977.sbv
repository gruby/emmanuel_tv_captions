I'M A MAN AGAIN

0:00:02.360,0:00:09.080
Mario Anibal Gimenez was born a man, but lived almost his entire life as a woman.

0:00:09.080,0:00:14.360
He even surgically implanted silicon breasts and pumped himself with female hormones

0:00:14.360,0:00:18.240
as his transsexual lifestyle took him across South America,

0:00:18.240,0:00:21.340
having relationships with different men.

0:00:21.340,0:00:26.700
When Prophet T.B. Joshua visited the nation of Paraguay in August 2017,

0:00:26.700,0:00:35.060
this is what happened when they met.

0:00:35.060,0:00:39.280
Man of God, help me. I want to be normal again.

0:00:39.280,0:00:41.160
Man of God, help me.

0:00:41.160,0:00:55.500
Man of God, help me, deliver me. I want to be like a man again. I want to be normal again.

0:00:55.500,0:00:58.480
I want to be normal again.

0:01:02.880,0:01:08.620
After the deliverance, his life transformed totally.

0:01:08.620,0:01:15.420
Anibal realised that the spiritual changes in his life after the deliverance needed to manifest physically.

0:01:15.420,0:01:22.560
After requesting for help from Prophet T.B. Joshua, the Emmanuel TV team paid for Anibal to undergo surgery

0:01:22.560,0:01:28.360
to remove the implants in his breasts, costing over 2000 USD.

0:01:28.360,0:01:30.660
It didn't end there.

0:01:30.660,0:01:35.520
The Emmanuel TV team took Anibal to a local mall to purchase male clothing,

0:01:35.520,0:01:39.760
items he had not worn for decades.

0:01:51.940,0:01:57.420
What followed next was an emotional reconciliation with members of his family and community,

0:01:57.420,0:02:04.480
all of whom were shocked at the dramatic turn around in his life after his encounter with Jesus Christ

0:02:04.480,0:02:10.020
at the Paraguay crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:31.380,0:02:37.920
If we fail to realise that there are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage,

0:02:37.920,0:02:41.500
we will continue to fight the wrong battle.

0:02:46.960,0:02:55.620
Prophet T.B. Joshua says the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:03:05.460,0:03:14.520
Right now, we are about to listen to the testimony of a young man whose life has completely transformed.

0:03:14.520,0:03:48.320
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:03:48.320,0:03:55.620
Hello everyone! My name is Anibal. I am from Paraguay and am here today to share my testimony with you

0:03:55.620,0:04:02.760
and to show the evidence of what Jesus Christ has done in my life.

0:04:02.760,0:04:09.280
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:04:09.280,0:04:15.440
I want to ask a question! Who believes in Jesus Christ?

0:04:15.440,0:04:28.380
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:04:28.380,0:04:35.940
I want to start from the beginning of my story, from when I was 12 years old until today.

0:04:35.940,0:05:02.740
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:05:02.740,0:05:06.680
He said that he grew up thinking and believing that he was a girl.

0:05:06.680,0:05:11.220
It was even accepted in his family for him to behave like a girl.

0:05:11.220,0:05:16.000
He did his first surgery when he was 14 years old,

0:05:16.000,0:05:22.360
and he did an implant surgery when he was 14 years old.

0:05:22.360,0:06:04.200
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:06:04.200,0:06:08.720
He said that because of this evil spirit that was inside of him,

0:06:08.720,0:06:15.200
he was behaving like a girl, and he was even taking female hormones to make his body

0:06:15.200,0:06:17.340
become like that of a woman's body.

0:06:17.340,0:06:23.700
After doing the surgery, at the age of 14, he felt much more like a woman physically,

0:06:23.700,0:06:28.000
and he began behaving more and more like a woman each day.

0:06:28.000,0:06:35.680
When he was 19 years old, he started taking female hormones.

0:06:35.680,0:07:20.180
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:07:20.180,0:07:25.760
He never felt any affection for women; he rather had affection for men.

0:07:25.780,0:07:33.480
Before, in his past life, he was working as an artist, in the theatre, and was also into modelling.

0:07:33.480,0:07:40.160
Because he felt like a woman, he felt he could do more that any of the women that he was working with.

0:07:40.160,0:07:44.120
Although he had friendships with women, he never felt any affection towards them.

0:07:44.120,0:07:47.920
He only felt affection towards men.

0:07:47.920,0:08:21.760
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:08:21.760,0:08:31.440
He spent so much money trying to become a woman, on surgery, operation, clothes, and everything.

0:08:31.440,0:08:33.480
He spent such a high amount of money.

0:08:33.480,0:08:37.960
And today, he feels that money was totally wasted because that amount of money

0:08:37.960,0:08:41.040
could have been used to help the needy, or do something else.

0:08:41.040,0:08:51.500
But he wasted all that money on trying to change, to become a woman, and it didn't work out.

0:08:51.500,0:09:41.980
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:09:41.980,0:09:48.840
When he was 17 years old, he moved to Argentina which is a very liberal country.

0:09:48.840,0:09:56.640
In that country, he actually got married as a transsexual person.

0:09:56.640,0:10:02.060
During that time, he achieved everything he wanted humanly.

0:10:02.060,0:10:12.020
He had money, a reputation, a job, and everything. But yet, he was not happy, he was not satisfied.

0:10:12.020,0:11:36.960
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:11:36.960,0:11:42.460
Six months ago, he received a terrible news that his mother had died.

0:11:42.460,0:11:47.220
When he went back to Paraguay, he was so depressed and he didn't want to go out of his home.

0:11:47.220,0:11:51.440
He felt there was nothing he could do, and life had no meaning for him.

0:11:51.440,0:11:56.840
Some neighbours came to try and advise him, counsel him, and he didn't want to listen to them.

0:11:56.840,0:12:02.240
Not until one day, they came and told him that he should go to a crusade in Paraguay.

0:12:02.240,0:12:08.040
He decided to go along with them to the crusade.

0:12:08.040,0:12:50.260
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:12:50.260,0:12:56.040
He went to the crusade. From the moment he entered the crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:12:56.040,0:12:58.800
he felt as if he was with family.

0:12:58.800,0:13:03.680
He had lost his mother and his family, but God gave him a new family.

0:13:03.680,0:13:09.440
God gave him a wonderful family that now, his Father is Jesus Christ

0:13:09.440,0:13:16.140
and his second father is Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:13:16.140,0:13:55.500
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:13:55.500,0:14:02.400
At first, he didn't want to be prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua because of that spirit that was inside of him.

0:14:02.400,0:14:08.560
He kept resisting, and then finally, when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him, he fell to the ground.

0:14:08.560,0:14:13.140
After he received that touch the second time, when he stood up,

0:14:13.140,0:14:21.440
until this very moment, his life has changed 100%.

0:14:21.440,0:15:52.260
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:15:52.260,0:15:57.380
The first thing he noticed after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua during the crusade was that

0:15:57.380,0:16:01.080
he went to his house, and as he showered like normal every night,

0:16:01.080,0:16:05.460
he felt so uncomfortable with his long hair.

0:16:05.460,0:16:10.000
He felt so strange and he didn't like his hair again.

0:16:10.000,0:16:16.000
After that, he began to look at his body that had the female breasts and he didn't like that at all.

0:16:16.000,0:16:17.540
He felt so uncomfortable.

0:16:17.540,0:16:20.120
From that moment, he started looking at the female clothes

0:16:20.120,0:16:22.400
He wasn't comfortable and happy with himself.

0:16:22.400,0:16:24.680
So, he decided that he wanted to change.

0:16:24.680,0:16:31.580
But he realised he didn't have the financial means to do an operation to change physically,

0:16:31.580,0:16:34.100
although that change had happened inside of him.

0:16:34.100,0:16:39.840
So, he asked for help from the team of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:16:39.840,0:17:37.440
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:17:37.440,0:17:41.460
When he received a call from the team of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:17:41.460,0:17:48.240
that Prophet T.B. Joshua himself was going to pay for the operation to remove the breast implants

0:17:48.240,0:17:53.040
and buy a whole new wardrobe for him, of male clothing.

0:17:53.040,0:18:00.020
He was so happy that he didn't know what to do because this amounted to over 3000 USD.

0:18:00.020,0:18:07.180
Prophet T.B. Joshua also left one of his team in Paraguay to care for him, look after him,

0:18:07.180,0:18:14.040
be with him throughout the whole process, and buy a whole new wardrobe for him.

0:18:14.040,0:18:45.420
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:18:45.420,0:18:53.480
From that moment, after the prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua, he doesn't feel any affection for men anymore,

0:18:53.480,0:18:55.940
there's no attraction for men.

0:18:55.940,0:18:58.580
Rather, he feels attracted to women.

0:18:58.580,0:19:08.460
Now, as he's 30 years old, he would like to have his own child one day.

0:19:08.460,0:20:18.500
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:20:18.500,0:20:24.100
He would like to advise everyone to learn from his own case.

0:20:24.100,0:20:31.980
Although he didn't even have to reach that side of prostitution, they should learn from him.

0:20:31.980,0:20:35.880
No matter the amount of money you spend on this earth -

0:20:35.880,0:20:40.640
he said he spent so much money, but that money could not make him a woman.

0:20:40.640,0:20:48.960
Today, he wants to tell everyone that he is what God created him to be, which is a man.

0:20:48.960,0:20:58.500
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:58.500,0:21:05.740
We believe there are many people watching you and many people here now who have a similar problem.

0:21:05.740,0:21:13.040
They are being disturbed by an evil spirit that is pushing them to engage in unnatural acts.

0:21:13.040,0:21:41.660
What is your advice to such people?

0:21:41.660,0:22:53.780
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:22:53.780,0:23:00.340
He said his advice is that you should not wait before you come for your deliverance.

0:23:00.340,0:23:05.820
Although it is never too late to change, remember that only God can deliver you.

0:23:05.820,0:23:10.020
This is a spiritual problem and only God can deliver you.

0:23:10.020,0:23:14.480
God is there! Jesus Christ can  deliver you, He can set you free.

0:23:14.480,0:23:21.380
Watch Emmanuel TV, get connected, ask for help, go to a living church, and believe.

0:23:21.380,0:23:28.940
For faith, there is no barrier. For faith, there is no frontier because all things are possible for Jesus Christ.

0:23:28.940,0:23:35.960
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:23:35.960,0:23:41.720
We thank God for your life and pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance

0:23:41.720,0:23:46.640
by making the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:23:46.640,0:23:59.920
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:23:59.920,0:24:09.400
We want to remind everyone that as Christians, we are to love sinners but hate sin.

0:24:09.400,0:24:17.540
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:24:17.540,0:24:23.260
So, our message is not to condemn those who are engaging in such acts,

0:24:23.260,0:24:28.440
but to fight the evil spirits responsible for them.

0:24:28.440,0:24:39.860
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:24:39.860,0:24:47.160
We believe this testimony has encouraged millions around the world to also seek their own deliverance,

0:24:47.160,0:24:53.660
in the name of Jesus Christ and experience the freedom that this young man has received.

0:24:53.660,0:25:04.420
Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade

0:25:04.420,0:25:10.620
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
