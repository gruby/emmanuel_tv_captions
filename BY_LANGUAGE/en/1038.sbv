0:00:00.000,0:00:02.700
Hallelujah!

0:00:02.700,0:00:27.980
There is a wonderful name Jesus

0:00:27.980,0:00:41.660
There is no other name I know

0:00:41.660,0:00:43.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:43.740,0:00:47.980
Happy Palm Sunday!

0:00:47.980,0:00:50.320
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:50.320,0:00:53.380
Hallelujah.

0:00:53.380,0:00:58.180
Many of us don’t know the purpose of life.

0:00:58.180,0:01:02.720
Sometimes, you see people lamenting because of their challenges,

0:01:02.720,0:01:12.700
crying because of their setback, complaining and worrying.

0:01:12.700,0:01:17.100
What is the purpose of life?

0:01:17.100,0:01:28.220
Your purpose of life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial.

0:01:28.220,0:01:39.280
Tell your neighbour, "Your purpose of life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial. "

0:01:39.280,0:01:47.220
It could be setback, affliction, or whatever.

0:01:47.220,0:01:51.600
Tell your neighbour, “What is your worry?

0:01:51.600,0:01:55.340
What are you lamenting about?

0:01:55.340,0:01:59.320
What are you complaining about?

0:01:59.320,0:02:09.940
Your purpose of life will never be fulfilled without that."

0:02:09.940,0:02:17.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:17.640,0:02:21.300
There is no other way.

0:02:21.300,0:02:27.540
So, prepare yourself for the battle.

0:02:27.540,0:02:29.680
Prepare yourself for what?

0:02:29.680,0:02:31.900
For the battle.

0:02:31.900,0:02:35.100
Life is not perfect.

0:02:35.100,0:02:38.680
We are in the world but we are not part of it.

0:02:38.680,0:02:41.280
Life is not perfect.

0:02:41.280,0:02:56.740
We live in a world where the enemy will never allow God’s purpose to be fulfilled in our lives -

0:02:56.740,0:03:00.760
you need to put up a fight.

0:03:00.760,0:03:06.360
That is why we need God.

0:03:06.360,0:03:08.540
That is why we are here.

0:03:08.540,0:03:14.320
The song says, "This world is not my home"

0:03:14.320,0:03:20.100
There is no way you fall asleep, forgetting yourself...

0:03:20.100,0:03:37.140
We live in a world where the enemy will never allow God’s purpose to be fulfilled in your life -

0:03:37.140,0:03:40.760
we need to put up a fight.

0:03:40.760,0:03:42.860
This is why we need God.

0:03:42.860,0:03:46.420
This is why we are here.

0:03:46.420,0:03:49.960
Let me share a revelation with you.

0:03:49.960,0:03:57.360
Success is not about your weakness;

0:03:57.360,0:04:09.160
success is not about your setback.

0:04:09.160,0:04:17.360
It is about what Jesus did for us at the Cross.

0:04:17.360,0:04:20.340
He made us fit.

0:04:20.340,0:04:26.340
Tell your neighbour, “Jesus made me fit”.

0:04:26.340,0:04:30.600
It’s a past tense event; it’s a past tense victory.

0:04:30.600,0:04:31.980
You are fit.

0:04:31.980,0:04:43.700
Jesus made us fit for God.

0:04:43.700,0:04:46.160
Hear what He said on the Cross.

0:04:46.160,0:04:49.620
He said, “Father, forgive them”.

0:04:49.620,0:05:02.440
The word, “them” includes both the offender and the offended, the accuser and the accused.

0:05:02.440,0:05:04.920
Once your sin is forgiven, what else?

0:05:04.920,0:05:05.780
You are fit.

0:05:05.780,0:05:14.440
Tell your neighbour, “Once my sin is forgiven, what follows? Fitness for God .”

0:05:14.440,0:05:25.300
Tell your neighbour, “Jesus made me fit for God”.

0:05:25.300,0:05:32.500
If you have lost that fitness, there is grace for you.

0:05:32.500,0:05:45.340
Spend your time with Him, at His feet, by meditation.

0:05:45.340,0:05:51.480
Meditate on His Word, the Word of God.

0:05:51.480,0:05:53.580
Those of you that want to re-dedicate yourself...

0:05:53.580,0:05:57.160
Because we are fit already; it is a past tense victory.

0:05:57.160,0:06:01.600
When I give you this, you may probably lose it, but we are looking for it again.

0:06:01.600,0:06:05.100
Listen to me.

0:06:05.100,0:06:12.540
Meditate on the Word of God and turn it over and over in your heart.

0:06:12.540,0:06:17.420
That is...

0:06:17.420,0:06:20.820
Meditation brings revelation

0:06:20.820,0:06:24.320
and revelation brings conviction

0:06:24.320,0:06:27.260
and conviction brings real movement.

0:06:27.260,0:06:29.220
You say, “I’m a child of God”.

0:06:29.220,0:06:31.600
If truly you are a child of God, that is real movement

0:06:31.600,0:06:34.980
and real movement is power steps.

0:06:34.980,0:06:37.440
A real movement brings power.

0:06:37.440,0:06:40.280
Real movement, "I'm a child of God" - power steps...

0:06:40.280,0:06:50.140
Power steps are steps with intent and purpose.

0:06:50.140,0:07:00.160
So, because it is not a true conviction; that is why power does not follow.

0:07:00.160,0:07:05.740
Where God talks, power talks.

0:07:05.740,0:07:10.860
I know many might have lost that grace of being born-again.

0:07:10.860,0:07:13.500
It is a past victory.

0:07:13.500,0:07:18.020
So, here you can come back to the table again, with God.

0:07:18.020,0:07:23.940
Meditate on the Word; turn it over and over in your heart.

0:07:23.940,0:07:29.780
Meditation brings conviction and conviction brings real movement.

0:07:29.780,0:07:35.800
That is, "Yes! We are children of God." - it means you become a solider of God.

0:07:35.800,0:07:43.100
You are not alone; God is for you, on your side, behind all.

0:07:43.100,0:07:49.860
You with God are majority - that is a real movement.

0:07:49.860,0:07:59.160
If God is for you, what follows?

0:07:59.160,0:08:01.580
What follows?

0:08:01.580,0:08:03.200
That is it.

0:08:03.200,0:08:08.480
The promise of God brings hope and expectation.

0:08:08.480,0:08:12.060
I can see the hope and expectation.

0:08:12.060,0:08:18.060
You are expecting something!

0:08:18.060,0:08:21.200
I can see you have received promise.

0:08:21.200,0:08:23.820
If I'm talking to you...

0:08:23.820,0:08:26.000
The hope is so great.

0:08:26.000,0:08:35.440
The way you laugh; if someone is expecting something, you will see it in his movement, in his appearance.

0:08:35.440,0:08:38.840
When you are expecting something, you are going to the office -

0:08:38.840,0:08:43.740
somebody promised you million of dollars, and you know that is sure,

0:08:43.740,0:08:49.720
"Good afternoon, sir"...

0:08:49.720,0:08:57.380
But if you doubt what you are going to receive and you are not sure if you receive it...

0:08:57.380,0:09:02.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:02.680,0:09:05.980
But what I'm seeing now is very sure.

0:09:05.980,0:09:13.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:13.200,0:09:16.780
So, I want to congratulate you.

0:09:16.780,0:09:21.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:21.280,0:09:23.880
It is huge.

0:09:23.880,0:09:25.640
This is a real movement, like I have said.

0:09:25.640,0:09:28.980
Real movement brings excitement.

0:09:28.980,0:09:31.400
I mean real excitement.

0:09:31.400,0:09:36.720
Real excitement; look what happened to Peter when Jesus was on the sea.

0:09:36.720,0:09:39.700
Peter said, "Lord, I want to come to You".

0:09:39.700,0:09:42.140
Because the real movement, you can see...

0:09:42.140,0:09:43.180
"I want to come to You."

0:09:43.180,0:09:44.920
He said, "Come!"

0:09:44.920,0:09:53.460
You can see an attempt to come on his own first because Jesus wants to see whether he is genuine.

0:09:53.460,0:10:01.880
Our genuine willingness plus God’s ability brings about the result.

0:10:01.880,0:10:07.400
You can see him with that genuine desire.

0:10:07.400,0:10:09.280
This is what I have seen today.

0:10:09.280,0:10:12.440
I'm just prophesying to you.

0:10:12.440,0:10:14.320
The way out for you has come!

0:10:14.320,0:10:17.300
(Amen!)

0:10:17.300,0:10:19.960
The way out for you has come!

0:10:19.960,0:10:25.280
Yes. Now, what are we talking about?

0:10:25.280,0:10:29.780
That which you are worried about,

0:10:29.780,0:10:32.860
that which you are complaining about

0:10:32.860,0:10:38.780
and that which you are lamenting about -

0:10:38.780,0:10:49.540
the purpose of life will never be fulfilled without that.

0:10:49.540,0:10:58.900
Our walking with the Lord – both good and hard times alike.

0:10:58.900,0:11:01.260
Good and what?

0:11:01.260,0:11:05.880
Hard times.

0:11:05.880,0:11:07.960
Like I have said.

0:11:07.960,0:11:13.300
Success is not about your setback;

0:11:13.300,0:11:23.580
success is not about your failure.

0:11:23.580,0:11:31.180
It is about what Jesus did for you at the Cross.

0:11:31.180,0:12:01.280
All the way to Calvary He went for me

0:12:01.280,0:12:09.300
He went to set me free

0:12:09.300,0:12:10.500
You listen to that?

0:12:10.500,0:12:12.540
He went to do what?

0:12:12.540,0:12:15.080
What else again?

0:12:15.080,0:12:20.640
Tell your neighbour, “Success is not about your failure;

0:12:20.640,0:12:26.820
success is not about your setback.

0:12:26.820,0:12:36.240
Success is about what Jesus did for you at the Cross.

0:12:36.240,0:12:41.420
He made you fit for God."

0:12:41.420,0:12:51.280
He made me fit to receive, to talk to God, to eat with God."

0:12:51.280,0:12:54.740
He went on the Cross to set you free.

0:12:54.740,0:12:57.760
So, what else?

0:12:57.760,0:13:07.680
Spend your time with Him and learn at His feet.

0:13:07.680,0:13:09.460
How do we learn at His feet?

0:13:09.460,0:13:11.880
By meditation.

0:13:11.880,0:13:18.240
Meditate on the Word; turn it over and over in your heart.

0:13:18.240,0:13:21.640
It is not the way we are reading the Bible today.

0:13:21.640,0:13:28.540
The Bible is not just a book; it’s an inspiring one.

0:13:28.540,0:13:35.900
So, if truly you are a child of God, you talk of real movement

0:13:35.900,0:13:39.540
and real movement brings excitement.

0:13:39.540,0:13:43.540
Even when there is no food on the table you are excited.

0:13:43.540,0:13:48.600
Nobody will even know the difference when there is money in your pocket, and when there is no money

0:13:48.600,0:13:50.980
because your life will remain the same.

0:13:50.980,0:13:53.200
People will not know.

0:13:53.200,0:13:58.180
Because you know; money in the pocket does not make you a child of God,

0:13:58.180,0:14:02.440
and lack of money in your pocket does not make you a child of God.

0:14:02.440,0:14:05.580
Your vision is different from money in the pocket.

0:14:05.580,0:14:10.620
The man that is poor is the man that has no vision.

0:14:10.620,0:14:11.260
Can you see?

0:14:11.260,0:14:17.120
You can know if this man is a true child of God

0:14:17.120,0:14:27.820
because real movement brings excitement and the promise of God brings hope and expectation.

0:14:27.820,0:14:29.460
But no hope...

0:14:29.460,0:14:36.800
A man without hope - you can see;

0:14:36.800,0:14:39.960
the appearance - nothing to write about.

0:14:39.960,0:14:44.060
Each time you have a little problem, people around you will know

0:14:44.060,0:14:47.740
and each time you have money, people around you will know.

0:14:47.740,0:14:49.360
What kind of life is this?

0:14:49.360,0:14:54.760
How can your situation dictate your direction, or rule you?

0:14:54.760,0:14:59.880
When you are good, you smile, when you are not good you run.

0:14:59.880,0:15:10.800
What kind of Christian is that?

0:15:10.800,0:15:15.420
What is the difference between you and the others?

0:15:15.420,0:15:24.940
Because those are the things that dictate their direction, their life, their mood, their dominion.

0:15:24.940,0:15:28.760
Those are the things that dictate their posture.

0:15:28.760,0:15:35.840
Ask your neighbour, “What is the difference between you and others?”

0:15:35.840,0:15:41.180
Others are happy when there is food on the table.

0:15:41.180,0:15:46.020
You are happy when there is money in your pocket.

0:15:46.020,0:15:50.680
You are happy when there is food on the table.

0:15:50.680,0:15:55.440
How can your situation rule your life?

0:15:55.440,0:16:01.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:01.700,0:16:09.140
The difference between us and others is simple:

0:16:09.140,0:16:12.840
We are happy when there is money in our pocket

0:16:12.840,0:16:15.680
and also we are happy when there is no money in our pocket

0:16:15.680,0:16:26.540
because the man that is poor is not the man that has no money but the man without vision.

0:16:26.540,0:16:29.320
Think about all this.

0:16:29.320,0:16:38.440
Your purpose in life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial.

0:16:38.440,0:16:40.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:40.140,0:16:46.080
(Your purpose in life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial.)

0:16:46.080,0:17:03.420
Your purpose in life will never be fulfilled without setback, temptation or affliction.

0:17:03.420,0:17:08.840
Overflow Congregation

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:09.840,0:17:14.080
Once again, “Happy Palm Sunday!”

0:17:14.080,0:17:15.620
I'm happy.

0:17:15.620,0:17:20.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:20.980,0:17:27.720
I'm just trying to listen to the sound of your clapping, to see whether...

0:17:27.720,0:17:35.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:35.740,0:17:37.880
Thank you.

0:17:37.880,0:17:50.780
When you listen to that sound, you can know whether it is a joyful one, pretentious one or pretentious calm.

0:17:50.780,0:17:55.080
But the one I'm hearing now... hmm.

0:17:55.080,0:18:03.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:03.540,0:18:08.160
Yes, it is your heart that is clapping.

0:18:08.160,0:18:10.120
It's not you.

0:18:10.120,0:18:14.320
And when our heart claps, God claps.

0:18:14.320,0:18:17.320
So, thank you.

0:18:17.320,0:18:23.060
Hallelujah.

0:18:23.060,0:18:24.980
So, you are taking this lesson home.

0:18:24.980,0:18:27.860
Can somebody talk to me, what lesson are you taking home?

0:18:27.860,0:18:34.360
We want just a little counsel, what lesson are you taking home?

0:18:34.360,0:18:36.740
Brother, what are you taking home?

0:18:36.740,0:18:38.980
What do you hear me saying?

0:18:38.980,0:18:46.760
OK, what I'm taking home is that in this life I cannot escape challenges - this is number one.

0:18:46.760,0:18:55.460
Number two; I may by poor physically but the real poverty is when I live without a vision.

0:18:55.460,0:18:56.580
Thank you, sir.

0:18:56.580,0:18:59.280
Thank you.
That is your lesson - that is wonderful.

0:18:59.280,0:19:00.960
Thank you.
Clap for him.

0:19:00.960,0:19:02.800
Our father wants to talk.

0:19:02.800,0:19:04.220
You listen to that?

0:19:04.220,0:19:08.560
He says, it seems, he will not be able to escape challenges.

0:19:08.560,0:19:19.340
And when that challenges come, they are meant to prepare him for the future.

0:19:19.340,0:19:23.100
- My name is... from Niger State.
- Thank you.

0:19:23.100,0:19:29.560
I learned the lesson from your message that there are no successes in life without challenges.

0:19:29.560,0:19:33.100
Challenges are just like fertilizers to make you very strong.

0:19:33.100,0:19:37.020
Clap for him!

0:19:37.020,0:19:41.820
Look at him, look at my brother; he says that challenges are fertilizers.

0:19:41.820,0:19:44.980
That is the tonic to our anointing.

0:19:44.980,0:19:53.240
Tell your neighbour, "Challenges are like a fertilizer to improve us.

0:19:53.240,0:19:59.760
Challenges are like a tonic to our anointing."

0:19:59.760,0:20:03.100
You hear that; that's all.

0:20:03.100,0:20:07.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:07.120,0:20:20.760
Don't forget; your challenges can be an affliction, hardship, temptation, setback, joblessness.

0:20:20.760,0:20:23.140
Try to understand that.

0:20:23.140,0:20:28.860
When you know that; yes - you have overcome.

0:20:28.860,0:20:32.700
Challenges are tonic, fertilizer.

0:20:32.700,0:20:38.080
So, why are we lamenting then?

0:20:38.080,0:20:40.560
Why are we worried?

0:20:40.560,0:20:50.300
When challenges come, once you worry, the purpose has been defeated.

0:20:50.300,0:20:52.540
Debts...

0:20:52.540,0:20:59.420
When you are worried, your heart will be in prison at the same time.

0:20:59.420,0:21:03.120
Worry imprisons our heart.

0:21:03.120,0:21:10.280
When your heart is imprisoned, you cannot communicate with your Heavenly Father.

0:21:10.280,0:21:15.680
You need a free heart to communicate, to talk to God.

0:21:15.680,0:21:23.720
When you have sickness and you are worried, then the purpose of that challenges has been defeated;

0:21:23.720,0:21:26.360
I mean you are in prison.

0:21:26.360,0:21:30.260
Once our heart is in prison we are finished.

0:21:30.260,0:21:37.240
Don’t worry yourself; leave it for God.

0:21:37.240,0:21:49.320
Once you worry, your heart is in prison because a joyful heart is for God.

0:21:49.320,0:21:51.440
Take note of this.

0:21:51.440,0:21:53.220
OK?

0:21:53.220,0:21:56.920
Worry means fear.

0:21:56.920,0:22:02.760
The sickness and challenge does not kill the fear of it kills.

0:22:02.760,0:22:06.900
The challenge does not kill but the fear of it destroys.

0:22:06.900,0:22:13.920
It is the fear of that challenge that destroys us, that destroys our relationship with God.

0:22:13.920,0:22:24.760
Fear would take you to occultist, witch-doctor, fear can take one to joining a secret cult.

0:22:24.760,0:22:30.600
Fear will make you to begin to look at Jesus in a very bad light.

0:22:30.600,0:22:37.040
With fear you cannot read your Bible, you cannot pray - whom are you praying to?

0:22:37.040,0:22:40.080
The word fear means worry.

0:22:40.080,0:22:45.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:45.340,0:22:49.020
The Bible says, in this world there will be what?

0:22:49.020,0:22:50.700
Challenges.

0:22:50.700,0:23:05.960
Put it that way, “In this world, there will be challenges; cheer up – stop worrying – I have overcome.”

0:23:05.960,0:23:10.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:10.920,0:23:18.000
In this world... this is why I say that the life is not perfect.

0:23:18.000,0:23:31.100
In this world, there will be challenges, situation; cheer up - stop worrying, lamenting, complaining -

0:23:31.100,0:23:33.840
that is the meaning of "cheer up".

0:23:33.840,0:23:39.080
The reason for stopping complaining; "I have overcome for you".

0:23:39.080,0:23:44.320
This is why Jesus said, He made us fit – meaning, He has overcome for you.

0:23:44.320,0:23:47.700
Once you are fit, you can face it.

0:23:47.700,0:23:51.740
Can we hear from our mummy or sister...?

0:23:51.740,0:23:54.000
OK.

0:23:54.000,0:23:58.960
You just tell us from the different angle.

0:23:58.960,0:24:02.300
Good morning.

0:24:02.300,0:24:07.580
I have learned that I'm not supposed to live the way others live in the world.

0:24:07.580,0:24:08.840
Even if there is no money...

0:24:08.840,0:24:14.440
Why you are not supposed to live the way others live?

0:24:14.440,0:24:17.320
Because; even if I don't have money in my pocket...

0:24:17.320,0:24:19.380
No, because you are a child of God.

0:24:19.380,0:24:21.400
Yes.

0:24:21.400,0:24:24.540
It is not an issue of money.

0:24:24.540,0:24:31.980
When I say, "Your situation is different from others; as a child of God..."

0:24:31.980,0:24:43.460
If one has cancer and doctor discovered it by test, "this is cancer", and you are a child of God -

0:24:43.460,0:24:48.060
that cancer is different from others.

0:24:48.060,0:24:57.460
Other's cancers kill, destroy, but a Christian's that have a cancer - their cancer strengthens their desire.

0:24:57.460,0:25:02.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:02.820,0:25:09.600
That situation is to improve him, not to impair him.

0:25:09.600,0:25:11.240
Take note of that.

0:25:11.240,0:25:14.740
They can say, this man has cancer and this man has cancer.

0:25:14.740,0:25:17.780
The question is who is this man and who is this man.

0:25:17.780,0:25:22.780
It is not the cancer that matters.

0:25:22.780,0:25:23.820
Can't you see what I'm saying?

0:25:23.820,0:25:27.200
Success is not about your situation.

0:25:27.200,0:25:29.540
Success is not about your setback;

0:25:29.540,0:25:33.180
success is not about you.

0:25:33.180,0:25:35.520
Who is that man? 
That is the question.

0:25:35.520,0:25:40.240
It will determine the kind of cancer he has.

0:25:40.240,0:25:41.920
Who is this man?

0:25:41.920,0:25:45.660
It will determine the kind of situation he has.

0:25:45.660,0:25:51.240
This man belongs to others; meaning unbelievers.

0:25:51.240,0:26:01.080
When others have that situation; the cancer is a killer - they cannot escape it.

0:26:01.080,0:26:10.520
But a child of God with that situation – God is still saying something.

0:26:10.520,0:26:15.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:15.180,0:26:21.480
God can use anything to speak to us.

0:26:21.480,0:26:27.420
You can be going to work in the morning and suddenly you see a python on the way,

0:26:27.420,0:26:35.820
laying on the very road you need to pass - a big one.

0:26:35.820,0:26:39.360
And you are a type of a person that is always afraid.

0:26:39.360,0:26:41.380
What would you do?

0:26:41.380,0:26:51.040
You will even give that python your ID card in your bag, before you run.

0:26:51.040,0:26:53.960
Everything; you will just drop it on the python and start running.

0:26:53.960,0:26:59.280
And python did not ask you to give him the bag and the money.

0:26:59.280,0:27:06.680
After you had dropped it, because of fear, you started running...

0:27:06.680,0:27:10.300
God is still saying something; God does not want you to go to work.

0:27:10.300,0:27:13.660
If you went to work, something worse would have happened.

0:27:13.660,0:27:20.180
But to send you back home, something that can threaten you... like cancer.

0:27:20.180,0:27:26.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:26.440,0:27:28.860
You start running, you abandon your...

0:27:28.860,0:27:33.240
By the time you get home, something will happen in the office.

0:27:33.240,0:27:37.320
You say, "Ah! Something happened?"

0:27:37.320,0:27:46.960
This is what God is trying to remove you from.

0:27:46.960,0:27:58.860
He often uses those things to preserve us, to stop you awhile in order to rearrange you.

0:27:58.860,0:28:03.280
Because you are too fast.

0:28:03.280,0:28:07.120
You are blessed; God gave you blessing and you received it.

0:28:07.120,0:28:12.080
This is a small office, where you are supposed to remain and continue your business.

0:28:12.080,0:28:20.220
Because when the money come, you will start opening offices everywhere and it will become a burden to you.

0:28:20.220,0:28:28.300
Now, situation may come and the whole office will be closed down, or you yourself will fall sick

0:28:28.300,0:28:31.680
and if you cannot run the office while being sick, the office will close down.

0:28:31.680,0:28:36.200
That does not mean the end has come.

0:28:36.200,0:28:41.660
... but to stop you awhile in order to rearrange you.

0:28:41.660,0:28:47.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:47.500,0:28:51.800
Tell us the kind of situation in the past, God might have used...

0:28:51.800,0:28:53.320
- Emmanuel!
- OK, thank you.

0:28:53.320,0:28:54.940
Good morning.

0:28:54.940,0:28:56.940
My name is Albert.

0:28:56.940,0:29:04.560
My past situation that God used - I was in prison; that was the time I spent reading the Bible.

0:29:04.560,0:29:09.060
That was the time I got to know God and learnt more about God, while I was in prison.

0:29:09.060,0:29:12.200
Clap for him.

0:29:12.200,0:29:14.220
You listen to that?

0:29:14.220,0:29:21.620
Because he is aware that God used that situation to strengthen him, to prepare him, to strengthen his desire

0:29:21.620,0:29:25.440
and determination for God, he will never regret.

0:29:25.440,0:29:35.700
It is when we regret... this is when we continue to make more mistakes.

0:29:35.700,0:29:43.060
But he is thanking God; and he is not even regretting, he is happy - and that situation was not wasted.

0:29:43.060,0:29:45.600
God was still saying something.

0:29:45.600,0:29:46.940
Clap for him.

0:29:46.940,0:29:50.700
Thank you.

0:29:50.700,0:30:00.800
Can somebody stand up and tell us the kind of situation God might have used in the past to prepare you

0:30:00.800,0:30:05.240
or to rearrange you, or to stop you awhile?

0:30:05.240,0:30:06.740
OK.

0:30:06.740,0:30:10.520
My name is ... from Ghana.

0:30:10.520,0:30:17.700
About two years ago, when I first got into arm forces, everything was rosy.

0:30:17.700,0:30:20.280
I passed my first promotional exams.

0:30:20.280,0:30:23.100
I got married, when I wanted to get married.

0:30:23.100,0:30:29.520
A month after my marriage I had a child, so I thought life would be like that.

0:30:29.520,0:30:33.420
But I realised that when I wanted a second child, it wasn't coming.

0:30:33.420,0:30:38.540
I started complaining, and feeling anguish.

0:30:38.540,0:30:43.880
Then, a time came for me to do my second promotional exams to the next stage;

0:30:43.880,0:30:46.980
I tried and I failed the practical part.

0:30:46.980,0:30:55.400
This situation made me to go more to church, read more the Bible, seek the face of God more.

0:30:55.400,0:31:04.640
To the glory of God, at His appointed time, I did the second try of the practical part and I passed the exam.

0:31:04.640,0:31:10.020
At His right time, He has given me a second fruit of the womb.

0:31:10.020,0:31:13.460
Listen to that.

0:31:13.460,0:31:17.700
So, what is your relationship with God now?

0:31:17.700,0:31:24.300
Are you fully persuaded concerning the Word of God?

0:31:24.300,0:31:28.320
Now, nothing would take me away from the love of God.

0:31:28.320,0:31:29.900
More than before?

0:31:29.900,0:31:31.440
More than before.

0:31:31.440,0:31:32.040
Thank you.

0:31:32.040,0:31:35.640
Now, I seek the face of God more, in all situations.

0:31:35.640,0:31:36.440
Thank you.

0:31:36.440,0:31:41.720
And don't forget to carry those children along with you.

0:31:41.720,0:31:43.660
- Yes, sir.
- OK?

0:31:43.660,0:31:47.140
Don't forget to carry those children God has given you.

0:31:47.140,0:31:53.740
When it comes to the issue of God, anywhere you step for God, allow them to step with you.

0:31:53.740,0:31:54.840
- OK?
- Yes, sir.

0:31:54.840,0:31:57.720
That is the greatest legacy you can give to your children.

0:31:57.720,0:32:04.660
Yes, sir.
I will.

0:32:04.660,0:32:10.960
Our mummy here mentioned two miracles, at first...

0:32:10.960,0:32:18.800
Once one is disappointed, worry comes; you begin to worry.

0:32:18.800,0:32:27.000
When you are worried, your heart will never be at its best.

0:32:27.000,0:32:37.220
Once you are heart is not at its best, you are in prison.

0:32:37.220,0:32:47.100
The heart that is in prison cannot communicate with the Heavenly Father.

0:32:47.100,0:32:53.800
When you go around; that is the challenge many of us are facing.

0:32:53.800,0:33:13.460
When we bring your heart out now, you will see within that heart worry, anxiety, pain of the past, offence.

0:33:13.460,0:33:16.540
Such heart cannot see God.

0:33:16.540,0:33:25.100
Blessed are the hearts that are pure.

0:33:25.100,0:33:28.880
So, these are the challenges we are facing.

0:33:28.880,0:33:39.880
And satan is aware of that; the only way he can get you is to make you worried, to make sure that the engine

0:33:39.880,0:33:43.020
of your car knocks.

0:33:43.020,0:33:49.220
When it is knocked, and it is time to go to church you say, "Ah. No, I cannot go to the church.

0:33:49.220,0:33:51.960
The engine of my car is knocked."

0:33:51.960,0:33:59.820
And you are forgetting that before you had that car, you were sleeping in the church.

0:33:59.820,0:34:06.000
You were even trekking from your house to the church but God has given you a car now

0:34:06.000,0:34:12.780
and the engine is knocked; you cannot come to church.

0:34:12.780,0:34:15.740
OK, let's listen to...

0:34:15.740,0:34:18.840
- Emmanuel!
- (God with us.)

0:34:18.840,0:34:25.700
"Alive" example to me.. it was in 2016; I was very sick.

0:34:25.700,0:34:28.340
I was taken to hospital.

0:34:28.340,0:34:30.860
I was having a stomach problem.

0:34:30.860,0:34:32.860
They run a lot of tests.

0:34:32.860,0:34:38.740
The doctor said they could not discover what the problem was but they would operate me.

0:34:38.740,0:34:40.660
I refused it; I said no.

0:34:40.660,0:34:42.180
They asked why.

0:34:42.180,0:34:45.260
I said I had a God, "Let me go and meet my God".

0:34:45.260,0:34:46.500
Luckily for me I went to...

0:34:46.500,0:34:49.720
Can I say something?

0:34:49.720,0:35:01.200
Will I believe that you have a God; that's why you refused the operation, or because of fear of death?

0:35:01.200,0:35:03.820
No, please - let us talk...

0:35:03.820,0:35:08.680
These two questions; this is clear to me because this is what I discover.

0:35:08.680,0:35:11.500
No. You tried all means.

0:35:11.500,0:35:18.020
Finally, operation was the last option, when they said, "No way"...

0:35:18.020,0:35:25.160
But for you to say, "After a lot of tests, they discovered they must do an operation..."

0:35:25.160,0:35:31.820
And you said to doctors, "No. I have a God."

0:35:31.820,0:35:39.840
That God would have done it first, and you would go for test to see the positive result.

0:35:39.840,0:35:48.420
When that trouble was so much, you would have gone to that God, of which you know is an "Alfa and Omega";

0:35:48.420,0:35:53.900
He would have done it and you would just go to doctor, "Test me. The sickness is gone."

0:35:53.900,0:36:00.160
But in this case, we have done tests, the pain was so much...

0:36:00.160,0:36:03.100
Later, they said there was nothing they could do, they had to operate you.

0:36:03.100,0:36:09.460
No! I have a God!

0:36:09.460,0:36:10.280
Let's hear from you.

0:36:10.280,0:36:11.020
So, I...

0:36:11.020,0:36:12.720
What later happened to your God?

0:36:12.720,0:36:18.680
I went to church and I prayed and I was made whole, I was healed, the pain disappeared.

0:36:18.680,0:36:22.360
I didn't take any drug, I didn't go back to the hospital.

0:36:22.360,0:36:24.360
There is nothing bad in taking the drug.

0:36:24.360,0:36:26.060
But the pain went away.

0:36:26.060,0:36:32.780
If you don’t believe God with your tablets, you will not believe God without tablets.

0:36:32.780,0:36:40.180
Tell your neighbour, "If you don’t believe God with your tablets, you will not believe God without tablets."

0:36:40.180,0:36:41.680
Tell your neighbour!

0:36:41.680,0:36:46.120
(If you don’t believe God with your tablets, you will not believe God without tablets.)

0:36:46.120,0:36:53.300
This tablet is "nature"...

0:36:53.300,0:37:00.600
What is the difference between different juices you put together in the morning,

0:37:00.600,0:37:01.920
and the tablet you are talking about?

0:37:01.920,0:37:04.780
There is no difference.

0:37:04.780,0:37:12.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:12.780,0:37:20.420
It is nature, and God is the God of nature.

0:37:20.420,0:37:27.880
I want you to clap for my sister because you took us to many areas people want to hear.

0:37:27.880,0:37:28.640
Thank you very much.

0:37:28.640,0:37:30.100
- You have more to say?
- Yes.

0:37:30.100,0:37:31.100
OK, say it.

0:37:31.100,0:37:33.180
Another case was...

0:37:33.180,0:37:39.220
When I wrote my first JAMB, I couldn't get that score for the course I wanted to do.

0:37:39.220,0:37:39.820
OK.

0:37:39.820,0:37:41.600
So, I had to pray and fast.

0:37:41.600,0:37:45.480
I told God, "This is the course I want to attend. Just help me..."

0:37:45.480,0:37:48.960
But that JAMB; you had first choice and second choice.

0:37:48.960,0:37:50.000
Yeah, but there is a particular...

0:37:50.000,0:37:53.500
Wait! Answer my question.

0:37:53.500,0:37:55.940
You know where I'm going.

0:37:55.940,0:37:58.040
- You had a first and a second choice?
- Yes.

0:37:58.040,0:38:02.960
There is no alternative for our faith.

0:38:02.960,0:38:06.080
My first and second choice are the same thing, but I have different...

0:38:06.080,0:38:09.560
You know what many choices normally cause?

0:38:09.560,0:38:16.840
It cause you not to put all your effort, "You know, if I lose this I will go to this."

0:38:16.840,0:38:23.460
But if it is only only one course you apply for, you know there is no other way.

0:38:23.460,0:38:32.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:38:32.180,0:38:36.720
Clap for her.

0:38:36.720,0:38:39.880
Thank you, my sister.

0:38:39.880,0:38:45.780
The big challenge; what happens to us, happens also to our children.

0:38:45.780,0:38:49.820
We always have alternatives...

0:38:49.820,0:38:59.800
Some will sit here and say, "Ah. If that pain is not going away, I will go to that place. But today let me stay.

0:38:59.800,0:39:02.760
Next week, I will not come here, I will go to another place."

0:39:02.760,0:39:08.900
We always have alternatives to our lives.

0:39:08.900,0:39:11.520
Alternatives...

0:39:11.520,0:39:15.400
Those are the same alternatives that have ruined us today.

0:39:15.400,0:39:20.440
... not only us but also our children.

0:39:20.440,0:39:26.820
One faith, one love, one God, one Holy Spirit.

0:39:26.820,0:39:31.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:31.720,0:39:33.380
You listen to me?

0:39:33.380,0:39:39.820
One God, one love, one faith, one Holy Ghost.

0:39:39.820,0:39:45.280
Alternative...

0:39:45.280,0:39:48.480
The whole thing is all over the world today.

0:39:48.480,0:39:53.440
I hope you are getting your faith back.

0:39:53.440,0:39:58.140
Some faiths are very weak, with what we are hearing now.

0:39:58.140,0:40:02.680
Some of our mummies, daddies and those who are sick; you see them with the placard...

0:40:02.680,0:40:09.640
Some of you, when you see them with the sickness, affliction, you say, "Ah. It is because of their sin.

0:40:09.640,0:40:11.920
Ah. This is why they come to the church."

0:40:11.920,0:40:15.040
Ah ah...

0:40:15.040,0:40:21.360
A man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.

0:40:21.360,0:40:22.740
Tell your neighbour.

0:40:22.740,0:40:26.820
(A man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.)

0:40:26.820,0:40:33.360
A man can be sick; that sickness could be anything: cancer, HIV...

0:40:33.360,0:40:34.440
Sickness is sickness.

0:40:34.440,0:40:43.720
A man can be sick in body and yet be a favourite of Jesus.

0:40:43.720,0:40:48.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:48.580,0:40:56.960
Today, you see people dying in silence because they don't want people to see them sick.

0:40:56.960,0:40:58.820
"What people would say?"

0:40:58.820,0:41:02.360
They would say, "They are not Christians. He is not a pastor."

0:41:02.360,0:41:03.260
They keep...

0:41:03.260,0:41:10.140
They can disclose their trouble to the doctor but to God... no.

0:41:10.140,0:41:20.840
A man can be poor and yet be a friend of God.

0:41:20.840,0:41:40.940
We should not allow our wealth, blessing, situation, condition to dictate or rule our life.

0:41:40.940,0:41:47.800
Be careful; the outcome of your prayer should not affect your faith.

0:41:47.800,0:41:56.080
Because you prayed and your prayer is not answered does not mean you do not have faith.

0:41:56.080,0:42:01.620
We base our faith on the outcome of our prayer.

0:42:01.620,0:42:05.960
People today base their faith on the outcome...

0:42:05.960,0:42:13.640
"I don't have faith; that is why my prayer is not answered. I will not pray." - No...

0:42:13.640,0:42:17.840
Stop basing your faith on the outcome of your prayer.

0:42:17.840,0:42:21.940
Some stand and, "In Jesus' name" - they would say, "This man has so much faith.

0:42:21.940,0:42:27.980
Look, he commanded and it happened, but I keep commanding and no way." - No.

0:42:27.980,0:42:30.820
Don’t base your faith on the outcome of your prayer.

0:42:30.820,0:42:32.780
Tell your neighbour.

0:42:32.780,0:42:39.540
(Don’t base your faith on the outcome of your prayer.)

0:42:39.540,0:42:43.840
Emmanuel.
My name is ...

0:42:43.840,0:42:51.500
In 2016, when papa was telling us about forgiveness; there was a man that started crying at the audience.

0:42:51.500,0:42:54.460
It was 14th of February 2016.

0:42:54.460,0:43:00.140
He was crying that he have helped people and all of them have failed him.

0:43:00.140,0:43:03.720
I was in the overflow congregation in Ghana church.

0:43:03.720,0:43:09.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:09.900,0:43:18.740
After the service I called the friend, but deep inside me I haven't forgiven him, I still bore some grudges in me.

0:43:18.740,0:43:20.640
It took me some years.

0:43:20.640,0:43:28.480
Last year in December, facing difficulties in my life, I called this friend, but there was no answer.

0:43:28.480,0:43:34.600
Deep in me, God asked me to call that friend that had hurt me previously and I didn't forgive him.

0:43:34.600,0:43:36.920
I forgave him and went to him.

0:43:36.920,0:43:43.180
At that point of my life; everything that I wanted for all those years came back within one month.

0:43:43.180,0:43:45.320
Clap for him.

0:43:45.320,0:43:47.400
Thank you.
Good.

0:43:47.400,0:43:50.900
This is a testimony people need to hear.

0:43:50.900,0:43:53.080
You listen to that?

0:43:53.080,0:43:57.480
The dividend of forgiveness.

0:43:57.480,0:44:01.320
Can you see?

0:44:01.320,0:44:02.940
Listen to him.

0:44:02.940,0:44:06.100
Forgive and see what follows -

0:44:06.100,0:44:18.940
what you have been looking for for many years, what you have been praying for will come.

0:44:18.940,0:44:23.520
Forgive and see what follows.

0:44:23.520,0:44:27.200
I believe your faith is lifted up.

0:44:27.200,0:44:31.260
I will take it once again;

0:44:31.260,0:44:39.740
being a child of God is a movement – not just a movement but a real one.

0:44:39.740,0:44:48.260
“I am a born again” this is a real movement and a movement brings excitement.

0:44:48.260,0:44:51.700
If truly you are a child of God – excitement.

0:44:51.700,0:44:56.740
Even when money is not in the pocket, be excited.

0:44:56.740,0:45:00.720
When there is no food on the table, be excited.

0:45:00.720,0:45:12.300
It honours God when we believe in Him when things look rough.

0:45:12.300,0:45:20.460
Things look wrong, when there is no money in your pocket and you believe in Him - it honours Him so much,

0:45:20.460,0:45:23.300
more than when there is money in the pocket.

0:45:23.300,0:45:31.700
Tell your neighbour, “It honours God more to believe in Him when there is no money in the pocket

0:45:31.700,0:45:34.460
than when there is money in the pocket.

0:45:34.460,0:45:41.760
It honours God more to believe in Him when there is no food on the table

0:45:41.760,0:45:45.440
than when there is food on the table.

0:45:45.440,0:45:46.940
Are you with me now?

0:45:46.940,0:45:48.980
What am I saying?

0:45:48.980,0:46:00.080
It honours Him more whey you believe in Him when you are sick that when you are not sick.

0:46:00.080,0:46:10.520
It honours Him so greatly, so much when you are sick and you believe in Him

0:46:10.520,0:46:19.100
more than when you are not sick and you believe in Him.

0:46:19.100,0:46:23.060
This is what satan has been using to rob us; our blessing.

0:46:23.060,0:46:25.120
Once we are sick, we cannot pray.

0:46:25.120,0:46:27.660
Once we are sick, faith is gone.

0:46:27.660,0:46:34.760
We begin to look at Jesus in a very bad light, "What have I done? Why this sickness?

0:46:34.760,0:46:39.400
I'm doing well, I'm going to church, I've stopped smoking, I've stopped lying..."

0:46:39.400,0:46:42.980
as if you are the one who stopped that smoking.

0:46:42.980,0:46:46.220
Has anyone power to stop smoking or lying?

0:46:46.220,0:46:46.800
(No.)

0:46:46.800,0:46:49.560
Truth is not our work but lying is our work.

0:46:49.560,0:46:51.340
Tell your neighbour.

0:46:51.340,0:46:54.980
(Truth is not our work but lying is our work.)

0:46:54.980,0:47:01.200
To say the truth is not our work; it is God’s work but to tell lies is our work.

0:47:01.200,0:47:06.860
We are very good at it.

0:47:06.860,0:47:11.020
No - this is what you should know.

0:47:11.020,0:47:16.640
To tell lies - yes, that is our work.

0:47:16.640,0:47:21.080
But truth - how can you say, "I stopped smoking"?

0:47:21.080,0:47:27.500
To smoke is our work but to stop is not our work; it is God’s work.

0:47:27.500,0:47:31.580
Overflow Congregation

0:47:31.580,0:47:33.680
To drink is our work.

0:47:33.680,0:47:37.360
To stop drinking is not our work; it is God’s work.

0:47:37.360,0:47:39.420
Tell your neighbour.

0:47:39.420,0:47:43.900
(To stop drinking is not our work; it is God’s work.)

0:47:43.900,0:47:46.540
Every, every like that...

0:47:46.540,0:47:48.060
To destroy...

0:47:48.060,0:47:51.000
Destruction is our work.

0:47:51.000,0:47:53.980
To build is not our work; it is God’s work.

0:47:53.980,0:48:00.420
How can you say, "Why all this now? I've stopped lying. Why all this sickness?"

0:48:00.420,0:48:01.800
Is it your work to stop?

0:48:01.800,0:48:02.960
Can you stop?

0:48:02.960,0:48:06.020
(No.)

0:48:06.020,0:48:10.700
Even if you try to stop on your own...

0:48:10.700,0:48:19.300
You stopped smoking on your own; when you sleep you smoke...

0:48:19.300,0:48:24.700
You will smoke...

0:48:24.700,0:48:31.600
This is what has happened; you smoke in the dream - by the time you wake up you start looking for a cigarette.

0:48:31.600,0:48:33.320
I hope you are blessed.

0:48:33.320,0:48:34.320
(Amen.)

0:48:34.320,0:48:36.620
Thank you.
