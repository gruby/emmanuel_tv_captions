0:00:00.100,0:00:06.780
Right now, open your lips and begin to use your faith to put a demand.

0:00:06.780,0:00:10.060
Ask for God's sanctification.

0:00:10.060,0:00:22.200
Sanctify me, Lord. Come into my heart. Wash me with your precious blood. Save my soul, Lord.

0:00:22.200,0:00:28.360
Cleanse me with your precious blood.

0:00:28.360,0:00:36.700
Ask Him to cleanse you with His precious blood.

0:00:36.700,0:00:40.120
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:40.120,0:00:42.340
[Amen!]

0:00:42.340,0:00:53.400
I believe your heart is right now the temple, the altar, in Jesus Christ's name.

0:00:53.400,0:00:54.220
Amen!

0:00:54.220,0:00:56.500
You may be seated.

0:00:56.500,0:00:58.200
Hallelujah!

0:00:58.200,0:01:01.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:01.060,0:01:04.240
There is a very important issue we need to know.

0:01:04.240,0:01:08.380
It's not only when the man of God attends to you in person.

0:01:08.380,0:01:13.760
When the man of God is attending to someone and you are there, and you are seeing what is happening,

0:01:13.760,0:01:20.300
your faith grows, more than even the person the man of God is attending to,

0:01:20.300,0:01:24.700
because you have the time to listen.

0:01:24.700,0:01:28.400
Opportunity to listen to what the man of God is saying,

0:01:28.400,0:01:34.180
to understand what the man of God is even saying, better than the person he is attending to.

0:01:34.180,0:01:39.780
This is how to build faith with what you are seeing everyday.

0:01:39.780,0:01:47.060
And most of you that watch Emmanuel TV, it is a gracious blessing,

0:01:47.060,0:01:54.820
especially when you are in a place where an anointed man of God is preaching,

0:01:54.820,0:02:00.880
or delivering a message and you are there sitting down watching,

0:02:00.880,0:02:10.420
or healing or prophesying, telling people something that is so awesome.

0:02:10.420,0:02:20.460
You are also surprised how a human can know all this. You that are listening - they are faith builders.

0:02:20.460,0:02:25.420
Nothing can build faith than that.

0:02:25.420,0:02:31.820
Looking at a man of God, praying for a sick one who is crying for help,

0:02:31.820,0:02:35.380
and you are there when he walks towards him and prays for him,

0:02:35.380,0:02:39.840
and the sick man stands up and starts walking. Ha!

0:02:39.840,0:02:41.580
That is a faith builder.

0:02:41.580,0:02:43.280
Tell your neighbour, 'Faith builder'.

0:02:43.280,0:02:44.380
[Faith builder]

0:02:44.380,0:02:45.700
I can't hear you.

0:02:45.700,0:02:46.680
[Faith builder]

0:02:46.680,0:02:50.840
And you need this faith to put a demand.

0:02:50.840,0:03:01.540
It is by faith you can say to God 'I'm sick'.

0:03:01.540,0:03:04.480
It is the also by faith you can say to the man of God,

0:03:04.480,0:03:08.060
'Man of God, please I'm sick. Pray for me'. It is by faith.

0:03:08.060,0:03:16.160
You can't just come to your senses or feeling to say, 'Man of God, pray for me. I am sick'.

0:03:16.160,0:03:18.720
There is nothing like that in the Bible.

0:03:18.720,0:03:21.460
You can only say it by faith.

0:03:21.460,0:03:26.160
So, we put a demand on the anointing by faith.

0:03:26.160,0:03:31.820
You need that faith. That is why the Bible says only faith pleases Him.

0:03:31.820,0:03:37.920
It means there is nothing you can do with Him without faith.

0:03:37.920,0:03:43.580
By faith, we put a demand on the anointing of God.

0:03:43.580,0:03:50.260
The testimony you have been hearing is just enough to take you there.

0:03:50.260,0:04:03.060
When it is  time like this, it is time to pay attention - attention with devotion.

0:04:03.060,0:04:05.540
How do we pay attention to this?

0:04:05.540,0:04:09.400
You also have to be in an attitude of prayer.

0:04:09.400,0:04:13.040
Like I'm taking to you now, you are supposed to be praying.

0:04:13.040,0:04:20.060
Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, as you are looking,

0:04:20.060,0:04:26.760
paying attention to what I am saying, be in an attitude of prayer.

0:04:26.760,0:04:33.160
Continue to pray.

0:04:33.160,0:04:38.740
Simple language - we have given you some words that have been anointed.

0:04:38.740,0:04:43.940
"Lord Jesus, take more of me", this word has been anointed for a long time.

0:04:43.940,0:04:49.180
The Lord gave you that language. It is for you and it has been anointed.

0:04:49.180,0:04:55.040
"Take more of me, give me more of you, Lord Jesus.

0:04:55.040,0:05:00.220
Take more of me - more of your purity, more of your holiness".

0:05:00.220,0:05:03.040
As you are talking, your lips should not move.

0:05:03.040,0:05:07.960
It's not going to disturb your attention and concentration.

0:05:07.960,0:05:14.040
Do you know that as I am talking to you, I am praying? Ha!

0:05:14.040,0:05:18.180
As I am talking to you, I am praying.

0:05:18.180,0:05:20.820
Why?

0:05:20.820,0:05:34.360
This word is passing through two natures - from Prophet to Mr. T.B. Joshua to you.

0:05:34.360,0:05:39.300
You can not see that Prophet but you can see Mr T.B. Joshua.

0:05:39.300,0:05:47.380
Prophet is taking it from God, and Prophet is giving it to T.B. Joshua and T.B. Joshua is telling you - this is it.

0:05:47.380,0:05:52.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:52.640,0:05:55.300
So, what are we saying?

0:05:55.300,0:05:58.300
When you are listening, you have a role  to play.

0:05:58.300,0:06:03.460
Not just to pay attention - to be in an attitude of prayer.

0:06:03.460,0:06:11.680
To pay attention with devotion is to be in an attitude of what? Prayer.

0:06:11.680,0:06:15.120
So, now a word has been anointed for a long time.

0:06:15.120,0:06:23.460
"Take more of me and give me more of you - more of your holiness, purity, faithfulness, kindness."

0:06:23.460,0:06:25.060
Continue to say that.

0:06:25.060,0:06:31.040
This is the time for you to learn how to pray in the spirit.

0:06:31.040,0:06:33.140
You don't know how to pray in the spirit.

0:06:33.140,0:06:37.600
All the prayer you know how to pray is "In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus."

0:06:37.600,0:06:40.660
This is what you are used to.

0:06:40.660,0:06:46.340
Like I am standing looking at you, I am praying -

0:06:46.340,0:06:51.540
that is Spirit prayer.

0:06:51.540,0:06:57.600
Oftentimes, "In the name of Jesus" is saying words, not praying prayer.

0:06:57.600,0:06:58.640
There are two.

0:06:58.640,0:07:08.360
It is not everybody that says,  "In the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" that is praying; many are saying words.

0:07:08.360,0:07:21.660
This is why it becomes so tense; because we engage our physical appearance - ourselves.

0:07:21.660,0:07:31.600
Because the Spirit prayer does not need [punching with hands]

0:07:31.600,0:07:36.740
If Spirit prayer, prayer by the Holy Ghost, needs [our physical appearance],

0:07:36.740,0:07:40.180
we need to go everywhere before the prayer is answered.

0:07:40.180,0:07:45.000
How can we stand here and send the prayer to the U.S., and the prayer is answered there immediately?

0:07:45.000,0:07:48.700
No it means it does not need this [punching with hands]

0:07:48.700,0:07:53.640
If it needs this [punching], we have to travel to the United States to get it to happen.

0:07:53.640,0:08:02.880
You can have that faith that moves mountains, if you pay attention.

0:08:02.880,0:08:08.620
That is, pray as you are listening to me.

0:08:08.620,0:08:13.860
Be in an attitude of prayer.

0:08:13.860,0:08:18.020
There are many things you are entitled to as I am talking to you.

0:08:18.020,0:08:31.660
Many things you are entitled to: One, you are supposed to be seeing things of celestial, vision,

0:08:31.660,0:08:35.020
seeing the immaterial world.

0:08:35.020,0:08:42.700
As you are looking at me, you should be seeing the forces behind this man. What is within? What is outside?

0:08:42.700,0:08:47.200
But you cannot see anything; you are only seeing a man talking to you.

0:08:47.200,0:08:50.500
That is why it is always difficult for you to believe.

0:08:50.500,0:08:56.540
If it's just this man that is talking you are looking at, it will be very difficult for you to believe.

0:08:56.540,0:09:07.260
For your belief to have a foundation, you must see beyond this appearance and you must see that vision.

0:09:07.260,0:09:16.000
Even before coming here, you are supposed to know much about this man, even before coming here.

0:09:16.000,0:09:20.240
It's only difficult when just a man like you, having appearance,

0:09:20.240,0:09:24.260
a similar appearance, every appearance you have he has, is now talking to you.

0:09:24.260,0:09:30.240
We have been to the university, we have lecturers, we have professors.

0:09:30.240,0:09:35.400
I mean, he will look like a lecturer to you, "This man is lecturing me".

0:09:35.400,0:09:40.040
Unless you see beyond this appearance.

0:09:40.040,0:09:46.980
When you see beyond this appearance, the job is half done.

0:09:46.980,0:09:51.000
The job is half done.

0:09:51.000,0:09:55.620
"Let us pray" - whether you have faith or not, you begin to pray.

0:09:55.620,0:10:04.440
This is what Christianity has turned to, and Christianity says you must have faith to pray

0:10:04.440,0:10:06.780
because if you do not have faith and you are praying,

0:10:06.780,0:10:12.100
by what authority would you put a demand on the anointing?

0:10:12.100,0:10:16.000
When you don't have faith, and you are now praying to God,

0:10:16.000,0:10:25.340
okay, by what medium, by what authority would you put a demand on the anointing?

0:10:25.340,0:10:32.600
This means you are using a net to fetch water.

0:10:32.600,0:10:36.880
Mark 5, verse 34.

0:10:36.880,0:10:43.980
"He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you.

0:10:43.980,0:10:50.860
Go in peace and be freed from your suffering'.

0:10:50.860,0:10:56.200
That shows that faith releases healing anointing.

0:10:56.200,0:10:59.700
Faith releases blessing anointing.

0:10:59.700,0:11:04.640
Faith releases deliverance, faith releases breakthrough.

0:11:04.640,0:11:07.600
What you are looking for - faith releases it.

0:11:07.600,0:11:14.900
He said, 'Go, your faith has healed you. Be freed from your suffering'.

0:11:14.900,0:11:21.200
We all regard faith as a Heavenly currency.

0:11:21.200,0:11:28.260
The more currency you have, the more Heavenly resources you purchase.

0:11:28.260,0:11:31.460
You agree with me?

0:11:31.460,0:11:33.600
Are you praying with your heart?

0:11:33.600,0:11:40.060
Simple prayer - "Take more of you, give me more of you." This is to fortify you, to overhaul you.

0:11:40.060,0:11:49.980
"Take more of me, give me more of your holiness, more of your righteousness, more of your purity."

0:11:49.980,0:11:56.020
Continue that. The Lord will take it up and will be saying it for you.

0:11:56.020,0:12:00.840
Then, your faith will begin to grow and grow.

0:12:00.840,0:12:06.720
You have more Heavenly currency to purchase Heavenly resources.

0:12:06.720,0:12:18.800
We don't just listen to the Gospel; we listen to the Gospel by being in an attitude of prayer.

0:12:18.800,0:12:24.080
When you are at home, and you tune your channel to a Christian channel,

0:12:24.080,0:12:30.020
and you hear a preacher preaching, immediately, you too begin to pray.

0:12:30.020,0:12:35.440
If not, what he's saying, will enter here and go here.

0:12:35.440,0:12:40.440
Like I am talking to you now, you must be in attitude of prayer, "Take more of me, give me more of you.

0:12:40.440,0:12:45.200
Take more of me, give me more of you, give me more of your faithfulness,

0:12:45.200,0:12:48.660
more of your obedience, more of your holiness, Lord.

0:12:48.660,0:12:55.740
Give me more of your holiness, give me more of your purity". So you begin to . . .

0:12:55.740,0:12:59.920
As you are saying it, you will just see your heart open,

0:12:59.920,0:13:06.280
and when your heart opens, you will begin to see me by your heart, you see visions.

0:13:06.280,0:13:09.940
You can only see visions when you see something with your heart,

0:13:09.940,0:13:14.580
but with your eyes you cannot see any vision.

0:13:14.580,0:13:23.860
You know, your heart is the prayer room. Your heart is the temple of God.

0:13:23.860,0:13:29.100
You want to see visions? You must see with your heart.

0:13:29.100,0:13:45.580
Inner my heart. Lord, I want to be like Jesus. Inner my heart.

0:13:45.580,0:13:51.220
Are you praying?

0:13:51.220,0:13:55.080
You must learn how to pray in the Spirit.

0:13:55.080,0:14:01.540
If you are a type that prays, like okay, you want to catch a flight, you are at the airport,

0:14:01.540,0:14:08.360
you will minimize talking to people because your time to talk to people is the time to pray.

0:14:08.360,0:14:12.520
You must create time for yourself.

0:14:12.520,0:14:21.000
Everywhere can be an altar. Altar of God - everywhere. When you sit down, you begin to [pray].

0:14:21.000,0:14:25.140
When you enter the plane, immediately you are entering, you start praying too.

0:14:25.140,0:14:29.120
When you sit down, you begin to pray.

0:14:29.120,0:14:33.260
Satan will not catch you unprepared

0:14:33.260,0:14:38.000
because the situation we face today is that satan keeps catching people unprepared.

0:14:38.000,0:14:45.120
Look at your dream. At the time you want to shout Jesus, satan has finished with you.

0:14:45.120,0:14:49.000
Okay, this is a good example. This is a crisis and I don't know.

0:14:49.000,0:14:55.560
It is like a blind man wanted to cross, but no Jesus.

0:14:55.560,0:15:02.420
I'm suddenly falling, and if I am now falling down, and say, "Jesus! Jesus!" No, it is for a selfish reason.

0:15:02.420,0:15:06.300
You want Him to save you; that is why you are calling Him.

0:15:06.300,0:15:18.420
But if Jesus has been part of me here, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus",

0:15:18.420,0:15:23.440
then He will save me because He has been the source of my life not because of a situation.

0:15:23.440,0:15:25.980
That is what we are facing now.

0:15:25.980,0:15:30.040
Start it now! That is the secret of my life.

0:15:30.040,0:15:38.500
As I am talking to you now, I am praying. When I am eating, I do pray. I am used to that.

0:15:38.500,0:15:42.820
When you have a certain time that you pray, satan will catch you before that time.

0:15:42.820,0:15:47.460
He has his own strategy and tactic, and he uses it.

0:15:47.460,0:15:56.740
What you started today will be very very difficult at the beginning,

0:15:56.740,0:16:04.140
but know you are playing your role before Jesus comes to play His own.

0:16:04.140,0:16:05.760
Do not give up.

0:16:05.760,0:16:16.400
Faith is a vacuum that draws the anointing from Jesus,

0:16:16.400,0:16:23.820
and that faith you are building now, the best faith builder is what you started now.

0:16:23.820,0:16:27.720
Prayer in the Spirit, "Take more of me, give me more of you".

0:16:27.720,0:16:30.200
Even self-healing will happen.

0:16:30.200,0:16:33.620
You will be very surprised that there is sickness you have been talking about,

0:16:33.620,0:16:37.240
and suddenly you wake up and find out that it's gone!

0:16:37.240,0:16:40.240
Yes, it will happen!

0:16:40.240,0:16:42.480
Brother, can I ask you a question?

0:16:42.480,0:16:45.540
What are you saying in your heart, tell the world.

0:16:45.540,0:16:51.100
"Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me, give me more of you, more of your strength, more of your companion,

0:16:51.100,0:16:55.700
more of your Holiness. Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of you."

0:16:55.700,0:17:01.000
And you are saying it now now? As you are looking at me, you are engaging in it?

0:17:01.000,0:17:04.260
You are saying it? And do you promise to continue this?

0:17:04.260,0:17:04.920
Yes, sir.

0:17:04.920,0:17:10.660
You need to try what you have never tried before to get something to change your life.

0:17:10.660,0:17:12.660
Sit down, sir.

0:17:12.660,0:17:19.040
It's a revelation for you. I am pointing you to the way of success.

0:17:19.040,0:17:25.220
I want you to stand up now to make this covenant, that this is what you need to be doing now.

0:17:25.220,0:17:31.000
And there is a word that as been anointed for you, '"Take more of me, give me more of you,

0:17:31.000,0:17:34.820
more of your faithfulness, more of your kindness, more of your goodness and more of your self-control".

0:17:34.820,0:17:39.180
If you are able to do this without your lips moving, without your body moving,

0:17:39.180,0:17:45.280
without people around you knowing that you are praying, the sky is your limit.

0:17:45.280,0:17:49.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:49.900,0:17:54.780
We have to make a covenant now; a promise to God.

0:17:54.780,0:17:59.280
Are you praying now?

0:17:59.280,0:18:07.860
By the time you start this, very soon, you cannot stop it. Something will continue.

0:18:07.860,0:18:10.940
Do you know blood? The way blood runs in your body?

0:18:10.940,0:18:15.480
That is the way the prayer will be running in your heart.

0:18:15.480,0:18:20.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:20.640,0:18:25.540
But you must start it first.

0:18:25.540,0:18:31.280
Just like Peter said to Jesus, "I want to come with you".

0:18:31.280,0:18:36.780
"Let me see your faith first." That is Jesus for you.

0:18:36.780,0:18:44.420
That is, let me see your faith means begin your coming; I will help you.

0:18:44.420,0:18:50.720
He does not just walk to you and says ''Be healed!" He wants you to show your faith first.

0:18:50.720,0:19:00.180
Jesus always wants to give us what we do not know how to do so that He can teach us.

0:19:00.180,0:19:01.040
Tell your neighbour:

0:19:01.040,0:19:14.820
"Jesus always wants to give us what we do not know how to do so that He can teach us".

0:19:14.820,0:19:21.500
His instruction is always what you don't know how to do so that He Himself can teach us.

0:19:21.500,0:19:24.020
This is exactly what applies to the prayer.

0:19:24.020,0:19:29.860
If you know when Jesus will answer you, you will only pray at that time.

0:19:29.860,0:19:39.220
But since you don't know exactly when He will hear you, you keep praying. Very interesting.

0:19:39.220,0:19:44.040
That is why He is God.

0:19:44.040,0:19:52.460
He is always giving us what we don't know how to do so that He Himself can teach us.

0:19:52.460,0:20:01.000
This is why He said, "I will make you fishers of men, fishers of men, fishers of men".

0:20:01.000,0:20:04.960
If you know how to do that fishing, He doesn't need to show you.

0:20:04.960,0:20:13.140
Peter was walking along. When Peter got to a certain level of the water and the water swallowed him,

0:20:13.140,0:20:23.740
and he realized that he is about to drown, it was only his hand that we could see up.

0:20:23.740,0:20:31.200
But Jesus realized that he insisted. Instead of going back, he was going forward.

0:20:31.200,0:20:34.020
You know when you are about to drown, you are to run back.

0:20:34.020,0:20:38.840
But instead of Peter to run back, he continued and persisted.

0:20:38.840,0:20:42.720
Jesus said, "Oh no, this is genuine willingness".

0:20:42.720,0:20:47.840
He stretched his hand and said, "Here is my help."

0:20:47.840,0:20:52.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:52.980,0:21:01.100
"Here is my help", and immediately Peter floated on the sea without a life jacket.

0:21:01.100,0:21:04.520
Imagine without a life jacket he floated on the sea.

0:21:04.520,0:21:11.160
In the same way, what is good for Peter is good for you.

0:21:11.160,0:21:19.160
So yes, your genuine willingness is needed.

0:21:19.160,0:21:29.040
Start it now. "Take more of me, give me more of you" - this is the only way.

0:21:29.040,0:21:36.460
No matter the miracle and blessing you receive here, to maintain them, you need Jesus.

0:21:36.460,0:21:41.920
Anybody can receive miracles, but not anyone can maintain them.

0:21:41.920,0:21:45.800
In the same vain, all the blessings you have at home: you have cars, you have this,

0:21:45.800,0:21:50.880
you were once a millionaire, you were this and that. You are unable to maintain them.

0:21:50.880,0:21:54.620
Maintenance is what we are talking about; it is not the blessing.

0:21:54.620,0:22:01.740
The blessing of God given to you; how to maintain them in the face of challenges.

0:22:01.740,0:22:05.780
"Take more of me, give me more of you."

0:22:05.780,0:22:11.700
You move with the Kingdom of God, you move with Heaven all the time but you do not know.

0:22:11.700,0:22:17.660
You keep asking for Heaven, but Heaven is with you; you move with Heaven.

0:22:17.660,0:22:22.140
You say, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Where is Jesus? Jesus is with you.

0:22:22.140,0:22:27.520
Your heart. My heart is Heaven.

0:22:27.520,0:22:31.860
"Take more of me, give me more of you.

0:22:31.860,0:22:45.680
Lord Jesus, more of your faithfulness, more of your kindness, goodness, self-control.

0:22:45.680,0:22:47.280
In Jesus' name."

0:22:47.280,0:22:51.400
[Amen!]

0:22:51.400,0:22:57.260
Let me pray with you, raise up your hand.

0:22:57.260,0:23:00.200
Nothing shall take you from this promise.

0:23:00.200,0:23:01.480
[Amen!]

0:23:01.480,0:23:09.980
You are standing today to promise before God that His Word will continue to run in your heart!

0:23:09.980,0:23:12.900
[Amen!]

0:23:12.900,0:23:16.220
His word will continue to run in your heart!

0:23:16.220,0:23:17.560
[Amen!]

0:23:17.560,0:23:26.300
Yes, His Word will continue to run in your spirit!

0:23:26.300,0:23:30.000
In Jesus Christ's name we pray!

0:23:30.000,0:23:32.540
[Amen!]

0:23:32.540,0:23:40.720
Yes, His Word will continue to run in your heart.

0:23:40.720,0:23:47.120
Prayer is the key, prayer is the key.

0:23:47.120,0:23:53.120
Prayer is the master key.

0:23:53.120,0:24:01.900
Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer.

0:24:01.900,0:24:07.400
Prayer is the master key.

0:24:07.400,0:24:14.400
Simple! He started with prayer and ended with what? Prayer.

0:24:14.400,0:24:22.260
It means 24/7, you have to be in an attitude of what? Prayer.

0:24:22.260,0:24:29.960
To be in an attitude of prayer means in the heart. Heart means spirit. Like you are looking at me now,

0:24:29.960,0:24:32.980
Your mouth is not moving.

0:24:32.980,0:24:37.360
A good example for the viewers all over the world. Can you see the woman?

0:24:37.360,0:24:44.100
She's praying Spirit prayer in her heart.

0:24:44.100,0:24:47.100
"Take more of me, give me more of you."

0:24:47.100,0:24:48.060
How are you, mum?

0:24:48.060,0:24:48.960
I'm fine, daddy.

0:24:48.960,0:24:52.260
You are still praying? Does "How are you" stop you from praying?

0:24:52.260,0:24:53.520
No.

0:24:53.520,0:24:55.300
How are you? I'm fine, thank you.

0:24:55.300,0:24:57.420
Are you okay? I am fine, thank you, sir.

0:24:57.420,0:25:00.120
Have you taken your breakfast? Yes, daddy.

0:25:00.120,0:25:03.100
Does this stop your prayer? No, daddy.

0:25:03.100,0:25:06.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:06.900,0:25:11.520
Viewers all over the world, this is what we are talking about.

0:25:11.520,0:25:14.640
What we're used to, we Christians today -

0:25:14.640,0:25:18.760
Good afternoon, daddy. How are you, daddy?

0:25:18.760,0:25:24.400
Oh I am sorry, I am sorry, I was in the ..., you know.

0:25:24.400,0:25:27.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:27.540,0:25:30.820
Ok, you talk to me again.

0:25:30.820,0:25:32.920
Good afternoon, daddy. How are you?

0:25:32.920,0:25:38.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:38.380,0:25:40.600
This is hypocrisy.

0:25:40.600,0:25:47.040
We love to be seen, we love to be noticed, we love attention.

0:25:47.040,0:25:50.540
You see my situation now, the way I walk, you greet me

0:25:50.540,0:25:55.600
because I want you to see me. This is what you people do outside there.

0:25:55.600,0:25:57.660
Good afternoon, daddy. How are you?

0:25:57.660,0:25:58.840
I'm not fine.

0:25:58.840,0:26:00.880
I am sorry, daddy.

0:26:00.880,0:26:04.200
Okay, I am okay now because of that sorry.

0:26:04.200,0:26:10.780
This is attention we love and this keeps destroying us. It is not good.

0:26:10.780,0:26:14.780
Can you see our mother here now?

0:26:14.780,0:26:22.620
She is in an attitude of prayer, and that is the prayer that breaks the yoke.

0:26:22.620,0:26:27.220
24/7 when you are going on the street.

0:26:27.220,0:26:34.580
Okay, move to the camera and begin to pray in your heart.

0:26:34.580,0:26:42.960
How are you? I'm fine, daddy? Continue again.

0:26:42.960,0:26:46.360
That is the life you should begin to live from now.

0:26:46.360,0:26:53.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:53.840,0:27:00.120
That is the life you should begin to live from now.

0:27:00.120,0:27:04.560
That is the only way.

0:27:04.560,0:27:15.300
[Trust and Obey]

0:27:15.300,0:27:19.520
The word "trust" means 24/7.

0:27:19.520,0:27:22.760
There is no break in trust.

0:27:22.760,0:27:30.040
That is why the word trust is stronger - no break.

0:27:30.040,0:27:35.080
When you say, "I trust this thing", it means 24/7.

0:27:35.080,0:27:41.480
If you trust Jesus 24/7, the prayer you are used to today,

0:27:41.480,0:27:45.560
it is because you cannot exercise this kind of prayer while you are walking.

0:27:45.560,0:27:49.440
"In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name, Amen, in Jesus' name, Amen, in Jesus' name."

0:27:49.440,0:27:52.760
We must shout, we must make noise, we must let people know we are praying.

0:27:52.760,0:27:59.280
This is the kind of prayer we are used to, and that cannot work on the street.

0:27:59.280,0:28:02.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:02.900,0:28:09.900
When you continue this spiritual battle, I am giving you five days. Wait.

0:28:09.900,0:28:21.120
What will happen, you will begin to speak in a new tongue; it will just come.

0:28:21.120,0:28:28.860
You will receive your right; what you deserve. You deserve excellence.

0:28:28.860,0:28:32.540
From now until Friday. Write it down, madam, you will come and give testimony.

0:28:32.540,0:28:35.680
I am using this woman as a good example to the whole world.

0:28:35.680,0:28:41.600
Viewers at home, you start it now. Start it now!

0:28:41.600,0:28:43.860
What are you saying in your heart? Tell us!

0:28:43.860,0:28:49.020
"Jesus, have more of me and let me have more of you; more of your goodness,

0:28:49.020,0:28:53.380
more of your faithfulness, more of your love, more of your peace."

0:28:53.380,0:28:57.100
Don't let any challenges stop you from saying that.

0:28:57.100,0:29:01.720
Even as you begin this journey now, there will be a lot of challenges

0:29:01.720,0:29:09.400
because if satan knows that you are about to get out of his way, he will bring a lot of challenges;

0:29:09.400,0:29:11.460
big challenges to stop you.

0:29:11.460,0:29:16.420
When your heart is disturbed, you can't say anything. Refuse to be disturbed.

0:29:16.420,0:29:21.900
By Friday or Saturday, you will just find that you are not praying,

0:29:21.900,0:29:28.620
but something is just praying, like a blood flowing in your heart.

0:29:28.620,0:29:35.480
You wait here in the church until next Saturday because I want to witness that promise.

0:29:35.480,0:29:41.840
I am talking to everyone here. I am talking to the viewers all over the world.

0:29:43.600,0:29:49.760
