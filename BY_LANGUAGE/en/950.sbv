0:00:00.000,0:00:15.040
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:15.040,0:00:16.540
Stand up.

0:00:16.540,0:00:22.960
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:22.960,0:00:26.600
When you were a student, you were in a cult.

0:00:26.600,0:00:27.180
Yes, sir.

0:00:27.180,0:00:30.580
- If I'm right?
- Yes, sir.

0:00:30.580,0:00:35.720
Nobody has delivered you; you just decided not to show interest and live a 'free' life.

0:00:35.720,0:00:38.500
You know it is a thing of the spirit – it is affecting you.

0:00:38.500,0:00:39.740
Yes, sir.

0:00:39.740,0:00:44.560
You were in a very strong cult, you even headed the cult members.

0:00:44.560,0:00:48.460
Yes, sir.

0:00:48.460,0:00:50.640
I want to see you.
I want to be your friend.

0:00:50.640,0:00:56.620
You can imagine somebody walking towards you and saying, "You are in a secret cult".

0:00:56.620,0:01:02.100
That cannot be an imagination because things of a secret cult is not something you can just see,

0:01:02.100,0:01:10.040
if you are not "spirit-filled".

0:01:10.040,0:01:15.600
But this was discovered by a mere handshake.

0:01:15.600,0:01:18.040
I stretched my hand and he stretched his hand.

0:01:18.040,0:01:23.360
I felt that strange light in myself.

0:01:23.360,0:01:31.980
I said, "No. What is this? This is not one of us. It pretends to be light, but it is not light. He is not one of us.

0:01:31.980,0:01:35.160
He is the opposite. Oh yes!"

0:01:35.160,0:01:38.520
This is just it.

0:01:38.520,0:01:40.060
And not just...

0:01:40.060,0:01:42.440
He is very strong.

0:01:42.440,0:01:47.180
Not just a member of a cult but a very strong one.

0:01:47.180,0:01:54.980
By what happened to him, you will know that he is a very strong occultic master.

0:01:54.980,0:01:58.400
Very strong.

0:01:58.400,0:02:04.180
Let's listen why he is in a strong cult and who this man is.

0:02:04.180,0:02:07.460
My name is Samuel Adisa.

0:02:07.460,0:02:09.040
I was here last Sunday.

0:02:09.040,0:02:13.120
During the service the man of God prophesied to me.

0:02:13.120,0:02:17.760
The woman beside me is my new partner.

0:02:17.760,0:02:26.660
Last Sunday, the man of God just walked up to me and said, "You were in a cult, when you were a student".

0:02:26.660,0:02:28.820
I was looking at him.

0:02:28.820,0:02:36.280
He said, "This has really destroyed you so much. I want to be your friend".

0:02:36.280,0:02:42.100
I confirmed this to be true.

0:02:42.100,0:02:51.940
When I was in "primary 5", my grandmother called me and said that she wanted to tell me a secret

0:02:51.940,0:02:55.900
that I should not tell anybody.

0:02:55.900,0:02:58.820
I said, "Momma, what is that secret?"

0:02:58.820,0:03:10.900
She said, "Your mother had several stillbirths. Because of this, I and your grandfather

0:03:10.900,0:03:19.840
took you to a witchdoctor to rededicate your life, to redeem you so you would not die".

0:03:19.840,0:03:24.360
I told my momma, "What does it have to do with my life now?"

0:03:24.360,0:03:29.240
She said that she wanted to give me some warning, that from now on there would be some things

0:03:29.240,0:03:35.600
manifesting in my life according to the instruction given to them.

0:03:35.600,0:03:43.340
That I would be seeing ladies around me, running after me.

0:03:43.340,0:03:47.320
As they wanted to redeem me, the witchdoctor told us to go out

0:03:47.320,0:03:55.080
to look for a beautiful lady's menstrual pad and a male dog.

0:03:55.080,0:03:58.560
They would use all of this to do that.

0:03:58.560,0:04:02.200
She said they had given them seven days to get all of this.

0:04:02.200,0:04:11.960
On the fifth day, when she could not find a beautiful lady's pad, she saw that there was a neighbour

0:04:11.960,0:04:17.220
who she met in the bathroom - this lady was a divorcee.

0:04:17.220,0:04:21.540
She put her menstrual pad on the ground after taking her bath.

0:04:21.540,0:04:25.340
My grandmother picked the menstrual pad and took it to the witchdoctor.

0:04:25.340,0:04:30.680
They used it to do a sacrifice to save my life.

0:04:30.680,0:04:34.720
As I was growing up, according to what momma told me,

0:04:34.720,0:04:39.220
I began to see ladies, even older than me, in the school.

0:04:39.220,0:04:41.320
People would be coming around me.

0:04:41.320,0:04:45.200
All of the sudden, I would find myself in the night...

0:04:45.200,0:04:52.740
In the dream, I would find myself in the midst of people - having a meeting with them, like at a conference.

0:04:52.740,0:04:56.660
Then, I began to study things that happened in the dream.

0:04:56.660,0:04:59.840
There were some incantations they would make in my dreams.

0:04:59.840,0:05:06.900
When I came to the physical world, I would be making declarations of all those things to my mates.

0:05:06.900,0:05:09.420
This would be happening immediately.

0:05:09.420,0:05:19.380
People around me would see that I had powers. They would come and ask me to enlighten them about all this.

0:05:19.380,0:05:23.960
One of my teachers called me one day.

0:05:23.960,0:05:27.240
That day, one of the other students offended me.

0:05:27.240,0:05:32.320
I told that boy, "You will fall into the well and drown".

0:05:32.320,0:05:35.100
To me, I just uttered these words.

0:05:35.100,0:05:40.140
Grandma had warned me to never utter any negative words to my family members.

0:05:40.140,0:05:46.580
Anybody that offended me - anything I told them would come to pass.

0:05:46.580,0:05:53.380
In less than five minutes, some of the teachers called me, asking what power I was using.

0:05:53.380,0:06:01.760
The boy I declared to fall into the well and drown is now in the well. People are shouting for his rescue.

0:06:01.760,0:06:07.740
He asked me to resolve this matter and bring the boy out.

0:06:07.740,0:06:14.140
The following day, one of the teachers called me to his office.

0:06:14.140,0:06:18.840
He asked me, "Do you know that you have a crown on your head?"

0:06:18.840,0:06:22.020
I said, "Yes, sir".

0:06:22.020,0:06:23.760
He asked, "What is the implication of this crown?"

0:06:23.760,0:06:33.020
I said, "I don't know. I used to see this golden crown with seven stars on my head, even physically".

0:06:33.020,0:06:38.380
She said that she would let me know the implication of this and interpret this better for me.

0:06:38.380,0:06:44.620
That is how she used to invite me to her house, where she would also invite another occult master.

0:06:44.620,0:06:48.460
The man acted like a herbalist.

0:06:48.460,0:06:53.680
He was telling me to say some things, examining it whether it would become true.

0:06:53.680,0:07:03.100
After then, I went to secondary school, at which time that power was already a part of me.

0:07:03.100,0:07:08.360
I felt as if I was superior - I began to act like this.

0:07:08.360,0:07:16.660
When I finished my secondary school, I began to look for ladies.

0:07:16.660,0:07:20.260
I had no control over this.

0:07:20.260,0:07:21.660
Any lady I talked to...

0:07:21.660,0:07:25.400
I never saw a lady that could deny me.

0:07:25.400,0:07:34.980
Whoever I wanted to talk to, any kind of woman - they would submit to me - even the older ladies.

0:07:34.980,0:07:40.140
I believed it was a good power given to me.

0:07:40.140,0:07:44.080
Before I finished my secondary school...

0:07:44.080,0:07:46.600
My mother is a pastor.

0:07:46.600,0:07:50.180
She began to be worried - she realised that there was something wrong with me.

0:07:50.180,0:07:57.780
I would leave the house at any time and go to people I used to have meetings with.

0:07:57.780,0:08:01.240
She began to take me to different prayer houses.

0:08:01.240,0:08:04.140
There, they asked me what my problem was.

0:08:04.140,0:08:07.380
She was taking me to church all the time.

0:08:07.380,0:08:11.520
She would wake me at midnight to recite Bible quotations.

0:08:11.520,0:08:19.940
I refused to open up to her because of what grandma had told me - not to tell anything.

0:08:19.940,0:08:22.100
When I finished my secondary school...

0:08:22.100,0:08:26.540
Before I finished it, God had really blessed me - I accumulated a lot of wealth.

0:08:26.540,0:08:29.960
All of a sudden, I began to encounter one problem or the other.

0:08:29.960,0:08:33.920
The first business got liquidated.

0:08:33.920,0:08:37.640
Then, I travelled to the northern part of the country.

0:08:37.640,0:08:40.920
When I got there, I was looking for means of this...

0:08:40.920,0:08:44.960
There, I began to see people coming around me.

0:08:44.960,0:08:49.460
Again, ladies of different caliber.

0:08:49.460,0:08:52.120
They used to give me anything I needed.

0:08:52.120,0:08:56.460
I took it as another opportunity to enjoy myself.

0:08:56.460,0:09:00.000
This is how I was living my life.

0:09:00.000,0:09:03.400
Later, God blessed me again - I accumulated money again.

0:09:03.400,0:09:07.600
I joined three companies as a distributor.

0:09:07.600,0:09:13.780
In 2005 I met a lady who was seeking assistance from me.

0:09:13.780,0:09:16.640
I regarded her as a beautiful lady.

0:09:16.640,0:09:21.480
I approached her and she got pregnant.

0:09:21.480,0:09:23.240
She was living with me.

0:09:23.240,0:09:24.780
All of a sudden...

0:09:24.780,0:09:28.580
I never knew that she had another way of doing things.

0:09:28.580,0:09:37.940
Before I knew it, the whole business got liquidated, to the extent that I had a debt of 10 million naira.

0:09:37.940,0:09:41.400
I found a way - I sent her away.

0:09:41.400,0:09:48.480
That is how I was going on with my life, looking for a way to survive.

0:09:48.480,0:09:54.080
Last year, I met this lady here.

0:09:54.080,0:09:57.800
I approached her; I wanted to settle down with her.

0:09:57.800,0:10:02.720
I got divorced 10 years ago.

0:10:02.720,0:10:06.480
I told her I wanted to marry her and she agreed.

0:10:06.480,0:10:14.500
She often asked me if there was anything that would make me not to marry her.

0:10:14.500,0:10:20.760
I told her that if I saw my lady with any other man, I would send her out of my life and would get another one.

0:10:20.760,0:10:28.460
She told me that I should not worry and that there was something she wanted to tell me.

0:10:28.460,0:10:31.660
I went with her to her village - we came back on Saturday.

0:10:31.660,0:10:35.580
On Sunday morning she said she wanted to go to The SCOAN.

0:10:35.580,0:10:41.360
I asked, "For what? You have never been there. Why now?"

0:10:41.360,0:10:42.540
She said she wanted to be there.

0:10:42.540,0:10:45.360
She left and I refused to follow her.

0:10:45.360,0:10:50.860
When she came back, she told me that she had got the Anointing Water.

0:10:50.860,0:10:58.860
I told her not to spray it on me, not to put it on my clothes or on anything in this house.

0:10:58.860,0:11:01.160
She answered, "No problem".

0:11:01.160,0:11:09.160
After some few days, in the middle of the night, I felt a sensation on me - as if somebody sprayed a perfume on me.

0:11:09.160,0:11:13.320
I woke up from a deep sleep and asked, "What is happening here?"

0:11:13.320,0:11:18.640
The following day I called her and asked, "Did you minister the Anointing Water on me?"

0:11:18.640,0:11:24.700
She said, "Yes. What is your problem? Is it not an anointed water?"

0:11:24.700,0:11:27.480
I said, "OK. Don't do that again".

0:11:27.480,0:11:32.680
I fell asleep and had a dream - I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in that dream.

0:11:32.680,0:11:39.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:39.980,0:11:45.760
He appeared to me and told me the history of my life.

0:11:45.760,0:11:51.080
Every lady I dated before and that I was ready to marry then -

0:11:51.080,0:11:58.940
I rejected them because they were either married before or I caught them with other men.

0:11:58.940,0:12:02.940
The Prophet was telling me about the lifestyle of these persons,

0:12:02.940,0:12:06.900
"This person lied to you that she is a single girl. These are her children".

0:12:06.900,0:12:11.860
I would see her children lined up before her. I would see all of them.

0:12:11.860,0:12:16.700
Coming to the lady standing beside me - I saw her too.

0:12:16.700,0:12:20.580
I saw three children before her.

0:12:20.580,0:12:27.120
I was confused, "No, this is a single girl. Although she told me she had been married and is a divorcee,

0:12:27.120,0:12:30.900
she never told me she had any children".

0:12:30.900,0:12:34.980
I called her and told her that I was not happy.

0:12:34.980,0:12:36.020
She said, "What happened?"

0:12:36.020,0:12:44.680
I said, "I had a dream. I wouldn't say that it was a nightmare. I saw children before you".

0:12:44.680,0:12:48.340
She said that these might be the children she would born for me.

0:12:48.340,0:12:49.320
I said, "OK".

0:12:49.320,0:12:53.220
All the children I saw resembled her so much.

0:12:53.220,0:12:57.940
Two days later, in the morning, she called me and told me that she wanted to tell me something.

0:12:57.940,0:12:59.660
I asked, "What is that?"

0:12:59.660,0:13:03.140
She said, "I told you I was a divorcee".

0:13:03.140,0:13:04.960
I said, "Yes".

0:13:04.960,0:13:07.260
She said, "OK. I want to tell you something.

0:13:07.260,0:13:12.660
If we are to go on with this marriage, let's go on with the marriage. If you want to break it, then break it.

0:13:12.660,0:13:15.680
I have three children".

0:13:15.680,0:13:18.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:18.580,0:13:21.840
I was battered.

0:13:21.840,0:13:31.840
I looked at my life - every lady I approached would tell me at the beginning that they were single,

0:13:31.840,0:13:35.340
at the end I would learn they had children.

0:13:35.340,0:13:39.880
My mind went back to what grandma had told me -

0:13:39.880,0:13:43.120
when she was looking for a menstrual pad of a beautiful lady,

0:13:43.120,0:13:50.960
she could not find it for five days, until she met a divorcee at her place.

0:13:50.960,0:13:55.300
It was the menstrual pad of that lady she used.

0:13:55.300,0:13:57.640
I told her, "OK, no problem. I will meditate on it".

0:13:57.640,0:13:58.500
She asked me what my decision was.

0:13:58.500,0:14:02.520
I said, "Don't worry. I can't conclude the matter now. I will talk to you later".

0:14:02.520,0:14:05.600
Last Sunday, I was in the house.

0:14:05.600,0:14:08.960
She called me again, saying that I needed to be at The SCOAN.

0:14:08.960,0:14:10.940
I asked, "To go there and do what?"

0:14:10.940,0:14:13.720
She said, "Is it not a house of God? Aren't you a Christian?"

0:14:13.720,0:14:18.400
I said, "I am a Christian. You can go. It is you who has a problem, not me".

0:14:18.400,0:14:24.480
She insisted and I followed her here.

0:14:24.480,0:14:28.420
When I got here, I was surprised to see the man of God walking towards me.

0:14:28.420,0:14:35.020
He began to tell me about the life I lived in the past.

0:14:35.020,0:14:39.000
I want the man of God to help me to get my deliverance.

0:14:39.000,0:14:43.520
I was already fed up with my life in 2005.

0:14:43.520,0:14:46.700
The only daughter that the first lady got for me...

0:14:46.700,0:14:55.180
There was a time I was fed up - I took this girl to the forest and I discharged the power into her.

0:14:55.180,0:14:59.780
At that time the girl was 4 years old.

0:14:59.780,0:15:02.680
That is my only daughter.

0:15:02.680,0:15:04.200
Since then...

0:15:04.200,0:15:06.360
She is 10 years old now.

0:15:06.360,0:15:09.460
Since then, people would call me...

0:15:09.460,0:15:11.320
The girl is staying with my mum, who is a pastor.

0:15:11.320,0:15:17.840
I allowed her to stay with her because I knew that what was happening to me might end up happening to her.

0:15:17.840,0:15:22.100
People, including my sister, were calling me, saying that the teacher in the school was suspecting

0:15:22.100,0:15:24.240
my daughter to be possessed.

0:15:24.240,0:15:35.800
Anytime they would bring this matter, I would dispel it and say that I don't want to hear anything about this.

0:15:35.800,0:15:42.580
Two or three weeks ago, my younger sister brought my daughter to Lagos and she told me,

0:15:42.580,0:15:52.260
"Brother, your daughter is very brilliant. She takes first or second position in her class but there is a question mark".

0:15:52.260,0:15:54.220
I asked, "What is this question mark?"

0:15:54.220,0:15:58.900
She said that when they went to churches, they would tell them that the girl was possessed.

0:15:58.900,0:16:10.980
In her school, some other girls accused her of initiating them.

0:16:10.980,0:16:14.460
I want the man of God to help me, to get my deliverance here.

0:16:14.460,0:16:20.220
OK. You mentioned your former wife - what were you saying?

0:16:20.220,0:16:27.440
I told you that there is a woman who has a child for me – one daughter – in the past

0:16:27.440,0:16:34.060
and I divorced her when I discovered that my business was liquidating because of her intervention.

0:16:34.060,0:16:37.040
It has been over 10 years since I saw her last.

0:16:37.040,0:16:38.940
Is that the only one you had in the past?

0:16:38.940,0:16:39.980
Yes, sir.

0:16:39.980,0:16:41.280
Or do you have more than that?

0:16:41.280,0:16:42.400
No!

0:16:42.400,0:16:43.800
It is 10 years now.

0:16:43.800,0:16:49.580
The daughter is 10 years because that girl was 1 year and 3 months when she left.

0:16:49.580,0:16:51.440
She left or you asked her to leave?

0:16:51.440,0:16:54.360
I asked her to leave when I saw the way things were going.

0:16:54.360,0:17:01.200
My sister - whatever you are, something good has come out from you.

0:17:01.200,0:17:07.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:07.500,0:17:13.440
If not you, we wouldn't be talking about this man today.

0:17:13.440,0:17:22.400
You came here searching for salvation and you received the Morning Water.

0:17:22.400,0:17:27.620
You got home and you know the type of man you have.

0:17:27.620,0:17:32.060
He warned you not to minister this water at all.

0:17:32.060,0:17:35.680
But for better...

0:17:35.680,0:17:38.820
You said, "Whatever will happen, let it happen".

0:17:38.820,0:17:46.060
You studied him when he was sleeping and you ministered it.

0:17:46.060,0:17:52.200
He woke up crying, "Why do you minister this?"

0:17:52.200,0:18:00.360
That was the beginning of his deliverance.

0:18:00.360,0:18:09.840
The following day, he had the dream concerning you.

0:18:09.840,0:18:17.240
Yes, it was that Morning Water you ministered that changed the mind of this man

0:18:17.240,0:18:20.280
and the man came to The Synagogue.

0:18:20.280,0:18:25.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:25.320,0:18:32.820
This man came to The Synagogue today, and he was discovered and delivered.

0:18:32.820,0:18:36.800
If not, he would not be able to stand - somebody who has a contrary spirit -

0:18:36.800,0:18:40.640
he would not even want to come here.

0:18:40.640,0:18:43.740
When he had warned you that he didn't want to hear anything about The Synagogue -

0:18:43.740,0:18:46.260
but he is here today.

0:18:46.260,0:18:49.060
Can you tell us - what is your mission?

0:18:49.060,0:18:59.620
Are you purposed to marry this man and that is why you are doing this, or you just want him to be safe, or...

0:18:59.620,0:19:00.960
Tell us what is going on.

0:19:00.960,0:19:03.520
Who is this man to you and who are you?

0:19:03.520,0:19:06.940
The reason I'm asking this question is -

0:19:06.940,0:19:14.840
if you actually have the mind to marry this man, you would not have told him you didn't have any child at all,

0:19:14.840,0:19:16.640
whereas you have three.

0:19:16.640,0:19:26.180
And you knew that sooner or later the truth will come out.

0:19:26.180,0:19:28.240
This is what we don't know.

0:19:28.240,0:19:36.680
If you have lied and lied, the day the truth will come out, it will spoil everything you have been doing.

0:19:36.680,0:19:40.700
My name is Ngozi Ogbanya.

0:19:40.700,0:19:43.740
I am from Ebonyi State, Nigeria.

0:19:43.740,0:19:47.200
I got married in 2005.

0:19:47.200,0:19:52.400
The man I married never told me that he had another wife.

0:19:52.400,0:19:54.040
Who is that man?

0:19:54.040,0:19:55.140
My former husband.

0:19:55.140,0:19:57.980
Don't tell us about that one.

0:19:57.980,0:20:00.320
When I meet you one on one, we will discuss it.

0:20:00.320,0:20:02.720
Tell us only about the man standing by you.

0:20:02.720,0:20:05.840
Don't worry, I will see you one on one.

0:20:05.840,0:20:07.160
Who is this man?

0:20:07.160,0:20:10.680
I met him in 2005 - I was sick.

0:20:10.680,0:20:12.960
Somebody directed me to him.

0:20:12.960,0:20:19.040
When I met him last year, we developed a relationship.

0:20:19.040,0:20:20.040
He said he would marry me.

0:20:20.040,0:20:24.020
I asked him if there was anything that would make him not to marry me.

0:20:24.020,0:20:26.940
He said, no - unless he caught me with any other man.

0:20:26.940,0:20:29.440
I said, "I will tell you something".

0:20:29.440,0:20:32.720
Then, I asked him about his past life.

0:20:32.720,0:20:43.140
He said he was married to a lady, and that person had a boy about whom he never knew.

0:20:43.140,0:20:46.780
Later, he noticed that this person was married to another person.

0:20:46.780,0:20:50.000
I told him my own story.

0:20:50.000,0:20:51.780
What was the story?

0:20:51.780,0:20:54.460
Just in a nutshell.

0:20:54.460,0:21:00.700
I told him that I was married to a person who had never told me that he had another woman.

0:21:00.700,0:21:03.580
I discovered it six months later.

0:21:03.580,0:21:07.660
I went back to my parents - they took me back to that place.

0:21:07.660,0:21:12.080
I was never happy with the marriage; I kept grumbling all the time.

0:21:12.080,0:21:15.260
I thought of committing suicide.

0:21:15.260,0:21:18.960
I bought a poison - a rat killer - to drink it.

0:21:18.960,0:21:21.300
Don't worry about that.

0:21:21.300,0:21:22.460
OK, it's alright.

0:21:22.460,0:21:25.260
You love this man so much?

0:21:25.260,0:21:26.520
Yes, sir.

0:21:26.520,0:21:31.520
Is it love of a husband and wife, or just what is happening out there?

0:21:31.520,0:21:34.340
I love him with the love of husband and wife.

0:21:34.340,0:21:36.660
OK, why...

0:21:36.660,0:21:39.080
If you love him so dearly with the love of husband and wife...

0:21:39.080,0:21:41.740
The love of husband and wife is from the heart.

0:21:41.740,0:21:45.840
Why were you hiding the three children?

0:21:45.840,0:21:47.380
Sir...

0:21:47.380,0:21:55.980
Look, he would have even been a father to those children, helping you to take care of them.

0:21:55.980,0:21:58.920
That would not make him to say no.

0:21:58.920,0:22:03.260
He himself has told you that he has a child outside.

0:22:03.260,0:22:09.260
That was an opportunity for you to tell him about your children outside.

0:22:09.260,0:22:12.600
This is the thing that spoiled everything.

0:22:12.600,0:22:16.120
Sir, I was just afraid.

0:22:16.120,0:22:16.960
OK.

0:22:16.960,0:22:19.360
Who is this lady to you?

0:22:19.360,0:22:25.080
I took her to be my fiancée that I would get married to.

0:22:25.080,0:22:27.980
She annoyed me hiding these three kids.

0:22:27.980,0:22:32.180
OK, now you know she has three children.

0:22:32.180,0:22:36.400
That is why I want God to speak.

0:22:36.400,0:22:38.780
You said you have a wife somewhere.

0:22:38.780,0:22:40.360
Yes, sir.

0:22:40.360,0:22:43.940
And you haven't seen your wife for the past 10 years?

0:22:43.940,0:22:46.020
Yes, sir.

0:22:46.020,0:22:47.860
That is the one that gave birth to my child.

0:22:47.860,0:22:50.100
OK, you haven't seen her for 10 years?

0:22:50.100,0:22:51.360
Yes, sir.

0:22:51.360,0:22:53.320
She gave a birth to a child?

0:22:53.320,0:22:54.100
A daughter.

0:22:54.100,0:22:54.880
A daughter?

0:22:54.880,0:22:55.460
Yes, sir.

0:22:55.460,0:22:57.760
OK.

0:22:57.760,0:23:04.780
The last week you came here - I want to know whether our sister was here in the church.

0:23:04.780,0:23:06.740
Yes, she was in the church.

0:23:06.740,0:23:09.400
OK.

0:23:09.400,0:23:18.620
You know, in order to deliver you and our sister we have to go an extra mile.

0:23:18.620,0:23:24.920
When we interrogated you, we collected the telephone number of the sister you were talking about.

0:23:24.920,0:23:28.780
Now, we hear that she gave birth to a child.

0:23:28.780,0:23:35.020
There is no deliverance we can do here, while a child is out there.

0:23:35.020,0:23:46.840
For ten years no one stood to be a father to this child - God will not answer any prayer we will offer.

0:23:46.840,0:23:51.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:51.340,0:23:56.040
You will be very surprised to learn that the lady you haven't seen for ten years is inside the church.

0:23:56.040,0:23:59.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:59.940,0:24:05.520
For the past ten years you haven't seen her - you will see her now, with the (child).

0:24:05.520,0:24:09.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:09.660,0:24:11.860
... with the child.

0:24:11.860,0:24:14.560
You have not seen her for 10 years.

0:24:14.560,0:24:18.100
The purpose of deliverance is for you to be set free.

0:24:18.100,0:24:22.240
Whilst you were undergoing deliverance, we interrogated you.

0:24:22.240,0:24:26.200
We asked you; "You have a child? You have a wife?"

0:24:26.200,0:24:32.240
Even if it was 50 years ago and they are still alive - we have to trace such a person

0:24:32.240,0:24:35.220
and to ask God for forgiveness.

0:24:35.220,0:24:41.020
We do not do that to separate the two of you but to bring everybody to the table.

0:24:41.020,0:24:42.800
You want to say something?

0:24:42.800,0:24:45.180
Yes, Man of God.

0:24:45.180,0:24:49.040
Having heard that you said that she is in the church...

0:24:49.040,0:24:52.040
No, I am not even asking you any question - don't worry.

0:24:52.040,0:24:54.700
OK, don't worry.
Don't be afraid.

0:24:54.700,0:24:57.760
Nobody can force you - God cannot force you.

0:24:57.760,0:25:01.020
You have discretion.

0:25:01.020,0:25:04.220
God cannot do anything without asking for your faith.

0:25:04.220,0:25:08.860
God will not say, "Take it!" - no.

0:25:08.860,0:25:12.300
Even God cannot force us.

0:25:12.300,0:25:17.000
That is why He gave us discretion that we can choose.

0:25:17.000,0:25:22.520
When He met this man at the pool of Bethesda, He asked, "What can I do for you?"

0:25:22.520,0:25:27.340
If the man had said, "No, I don't want You to do anything for me", Jesus would have said, "OK".

0:25:27.340,0:25:29.160
He will not force you.

0:25:29.160,0:25:32.440
What is not done well is not done at all.

0:25:32.440,0:25:36.380
If we just make it half-way - deliver both of you and send you out -

0:25:36.380,0:25:39.300
what about that woman and the child?

0:25:39.300,0:25:42.100
If she didn't have a child for you - no problem.

0:25:42.100,0:25:44.440
Can you call the woman out?

0:25:44.440,0:25:57.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:57.720,0:26:13.400
Brother, you are supposed to be the happiest person in our midst, or even in the world.

0:26:13.400,0:26:16.920
I don't know you, you don't know me.

0:26:16.920,0:26:26.600
It was on Sunday, I saw you sitting down there - and I don't know anbody but Jesus who can do this.

0:26:26.600,0:26:33.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:33.460,0:26:36.400
It is only Jesus who can do this.

0:26:36.400,0:26:38.640
Ten years now.

0:26:38.640,0:26:43.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:43.720,0:26:45.640
Ten years now.

0:26:45.640,0:26:52.860
God used my sister to minister the Morning Water and to bring you here.

0:26:52.860,0:26:55.740
If not my sister, you would not come here.

0:26:55.740,0:27:04.500
We are not doing that to humiliate you but to set everyone of us free.

0:27:04.500,0:27:05.700
Simple.

0:27:05.700,0:27:07.740
Can I ask my brother a question?

0:27:07.740,0:27:09.760
Do you know this lady?

0:27:09.760,0:27:11.100
I don't know this one.

0:27:11.100,0:27:12.580
How old is the other one?

0:27:12.580,0:27:15.160
Ten years, sir.

0:27:15.160,0:27:17.780
On my way here, I asked my sister to bring her here for deliverance.

0:27:17.780,0:27:18.280
OK.

0:27:18.280,0:27:19.680
So I don't know this one.

0:27:19.680,0:27:22.880
OK, it's alright, don't worry.

0:27:22.880,0:27:24.240
But you know this woman?

0:27:24.240,0:27:25.120
I know her very well.

0:27:25.120,0:27:26.360
It is the woman you were talking about?

0:27:26.360,0:27:26.940
Yes, sir.

0:27:26.940,0:27:28.060
OK, it's alright.

0:27:28.060,0:27:30.380
Rest your peace.

0:27:30.380,0:27:32.700
OK, it's alright.

0:27:32.700,0:27:36.720
The daughter they are talking about is living with his mum?

0:27:36.720,0:27:38.240
Yes, she is living with his mum.

0:27:38.240,0:27:41.160
She was 1 year and 7 months old when they collected her from me.

0:27:41.160,0:27:44.100
She will be 10 years old in August.

0:27:44.100,0:27:46.780
She will be 10 years old in August?

0:27:46.780,0:27:49.700
OK.

0:27:49.700,0:28:01.360
If I give you just 3 minutes, you have to say everything in truth and in faith, OK?

0:28:01.360,0:28:05.680
I am Mary Adolor.
I am from Edo State, Nigeria.

0:28:05.680,0:28:13.200
This man standing by me is my husband, the father of my children.

0:28:13.200,0:28:17.560
I have a child for him - that is Precious, my first daughter.

0:28:17.560,0:28:24.280
Along the line we started having problems - the women issue.

0:28:24.280,0:28:25.840
A friend would come and visit me.

0:28:25.840,0:28:32.940
Before I knew it, my husband would see her off, befriend her and fall in love with her.

0:28:32.940,0:28:35.560
All my friends were going out with him.

0:28:35.560,0:28:38.040
That is where the problem started.

0:28:38.040,0:28:44.860
When this problem started, I didn't know that he was looking for a way to chase me out.

0:28:44.860,0:28:47.640
Then, he said that I should pack my things.

0:28:47.640,0:28:54.200
At that time I was pregnant for 1 month and 2 weeks.

0:28:54.200,0:28:56.340
This is that very girl.

0:28:56.340,0:28:59.640
He sent me out of his house to the village.

0:28:59.640,0:29:05.460
I went to my mother's place - I stayed there and gave birth to this girl.

0:29:05.460,0:29:10.560
He never asked about her or even called.

0:29:10.560,0:29:13.760
I picked his mum's number and called her.

0:29:13.760,0:29:16.000
I still had his mum's number then.

0:29:16.000,0:29:19.720
I told her that I was pregnant.

0:29:19.720,0:29:23.180
She said that she was happy.

0:29:23.180,0:29:29.380
I don't know when my husband told her that he was not responsible for that pregnancy.

0:29:29.380,0:29:35.640
When I put to bed, I called them, thinking that the mother or any member of the family would come.

0:29:35.640,0:29:40.820
His mother called me back and said that my husband said that he was not responsible for this pregnancy.

0:29:40.820,0:29:42.680
I said, "Mummy, what are you saying?"

0:29:42.680,0:29:44.920
She said that that was what her son had told her.

0:29:44.920,0:29:49.800
I said, "OK, if you say so. I will take care of her".

0:29:49.800,0:29:51.300
OK, thank you.

0:29:51.300,0:29:55.060
The 3 minutes I've given you - I think you have explained everything.

0:29:55.060,0:30:00.020
My sister here - she is my daughter.

0:30:00.020,0:30:03.340
The issue of marriage is not even to be discussed now.

0:30:03.340,0:30:06.340
Put the issue of marriage behind you.

0:30:06.340,0:30:11.520
I don't believe that, unless you are completely set free.

0:30:11.520,0:30:14.720
Madam, forget about marrying this man.

0:30:14.720,0:30:19.620
You too, you need to be set free first.

0:30:19.620,0:30:26.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:26.480,0:30:31.320
My sister, please - you need to be fortified.

0:30:31.320,0:30:33.720
Come and stand here.

0:30:33.720,0:30:37.760
You have to be alone - you are not married now.

0:30:37.760,0:30:43.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:43.040,0:30:48.080
After your deliverance, you can decide what to do with your life.

0:30:48.080,0:30:55.480
The issue of marrying this man you are living with - remove it from the record.

0:30:55.480,0:30:57.940
You need to be set free.

0:30:57.940,0:31:00.060
When you are set free, we will talk.

0:31:00.060,0:31:02.140
You are a beautiful woman - look in the mirror.

0:31:02.140,0:31:09.260
When the lady is delivered, people will be looking for her, not her looking for people.

0:31:09.260,0:31:12.960
That is our real value.

0:31:12.960,0:31:16.180
What about this little one?

0:31:16.180,0:31:18.580
This is the only daughter that I know of.

0:31:18.580,0:31:20.120
This is my younger sister.

0:31:20.120,0:31:21.260
OK.

0:31:21.260,0:31:22.840
OK, this is the...?

0:31:22.840,0:31:24.740
The daughter.

0:31:24.740,0:31:28.620
You are the mother?

0:31:28.620,0:31:30.660
She is my daughter.

0:31:30.660,0:31:32.100
She is your mother?

0:31:32.100,0:31:33.140
No.

0:31:33.140,0:31:36.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:36.780,0:31:39.920
Give me your hand.

0:31:39.920,0:31:41.320
What is your name?

0:31:41.320,0:31:45.200
Precious.

0:31:45.200,0:31:48.200
Look at her, look at this woman.

0:31:48.200,0:31:51.060
Who is she?

0:31:51.060,0:31:52.800
She is not my mummy.

0:31:52.800,0:31:55.240
Who is she?

0:31:55.240,0:31:57.600
I don't know.

0:31:57.600,0:32:01.200
When did you see this young lady the last time?

0:32:01.200,0:32:02.840
It is 8 years now.

0:32:02.840,0:32:05.660
She will be 10 years in August.

0:32:05.660,0:32:09.620
You can see the reason why she says that she doesn't know you?

0:32:09.620,0:32:10.660
I know.

0:32:10.660,0:32:11.640
She cannot know you.

0:32:11.640,0:32:12.960
Yes.
OK.

0:32:12.960,0:32:19.140
I want you to come next Sunday and give testimony of your freedom.

0:32:19.140,0:32:21.640
Simple.

0:32:21.640,0:32:27.260
God is in control.

0:32:27.260,0:32:29.200
Take my mother.

0:32:29.200,0:32:33.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:33.700,0:32:36.720
Please, take care of my brother.

0:32:36.720,0:32:40.820
Thank you very much.

0:32:40.820,0:32:44.320
Give me...

0:32:44.320,0:32:46.100
Who are you?
Come on!

0:32:46.100,0:32:47.140
Come on here!

0:32:47.140,0:32:48.300
Stand up!

0:32:48.300,0:32:50.400
Come here!
Who are you?!

0:32:50.400,0:32:53.120
I will set you free today.

0:32:53.120,0:32:54.540
It is a lie!

0:32:54.540,0:32:56.260
Who are you?!

0:32:56.260,0:32:58.440
You can't deliver her; leave her for me.

0:32:58.440,0:33:01.980
I have destroyed her.

0:33:01.980,0:33:05.660
What have you done to her, her marriage, her family?

0:33:05.660,0:33:10.080
No matter how beautiful she is – no man.

0:33:10.080,0:33:14.580
I want to start from her - from one to two to three.

0:33:14.580,0:33:16.260
OK.

0:33:16.260,0:33:19.020
Who are you?!

0:33:19.020,0:33:21.920
I am the husband.

0:33:21.920,0:33:23.420
Husband, you listen to that.

0:33:23.420,0:33:25.900
I married her when she was young.

0:33:25.900,0:33:27.540
Her mother gave her to me.

0:33:27.540,0:33:30.560
Leave her alone!
Leave her!

0:33:30.560,0:33:35.240
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:33:35.240,0:33:40.180
She did not marry the right person she was supposed to marry.

0:33:40.180,0:33:42.660
I made her life useless.

0:33:42.660,0:33:46.080
It is her that I want to destroy because she is my wife.

0:33:46.080,0:33:49.060
How did you enter her?

0:33:49.060,0:33:51.000
When she was small.

0:33:51.000,0:33:54.540
So, leave her for me; you cannot deliver her.

0:33:54.540,0:34:00.080
I have married her – for years.

0:34:00.080,0:34:05.280
I destroyed her.

0:34:05.280,0:34:07.100
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:34:07.100,0:34:10.880
Her family – the parents disowned her.

0:34:10.880,0:34:14.580
I am sitting down there.

0:34:14.580,0:34:16.580
You think you can deliver her.

0:34:16.580,0:34:18.520
Leave her for me!

0:34:18.520,0:34:21.720
I made her to lie, here and there.

0:34:21.720,0:34:24.520
What kind of lie - explain!

0:34:24.520,0:34:28.160
She says what is not true because I want to marry her.

0:34:28.160,0:34:31.720
I have destroyed her.

0:34:31.720,0:34:39.920
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:34:39.920,0:34:42.280
Oh, this is momma.

0:34:42.280,0:34:44.080
Thank you very much, Momma.

0:34:44.080,0:34:47.660
You heard my call and you are here - thank you.

0:34:47.660,0:34:51.140
You can just come here.

0:34:51.140,0:34:52.760
OK.

0:34:52.760,0:34:57.140
Oh, this is our mum - thank you.

0:34:57.140,0:34:59.060
Glory be to God - this is my sister.

0:34:59.060,0:35:02.940
My sister is delivered, finally - she is free now.

0:35:02.940,0:35:05.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:05.500,0:35:07.280
She is free.

0:35:07.280,0:35:11.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:11.880,0:35:13.980
You are a beautiful woman.

0:35:13.980,0:35:18.260
It is satan who was trying to play a funny game.

0:35:18.260,0:35:20.280
You are a beautiful woman.

0:35:20.280,0:35:23.860
Now, after you deliverance, you might have discovered yourself -

0:35:23.860,0:35:27.240
"Why me of all this rubbish? Why me of all this?"

0:35:27.240,0:35:30.020
I want to be there for you.

0:35:30.020,0:35:34.840
The Lord will give you a wonderful husband and you will settle down.

0:35:34.840,0:35:37.300
OK.

0:35:37.300,0:35:41.280
All the previous journey is just your past.

0:35:41.280,0:35:42.900
It has become past.

0:35:42.900,0:35:48.400
Like I told you - I don't see you and this man - it is just trouble.

0:35:48.400,0:35:50.880
He has his own trouble, you have your trouble.

0:35:50.880,0:35:55.160
Now, the deliverance has come - you people cannot come together.

0:35:55.160,0:35:59.660
Your future now - I know that when you come back next time - big testimony.

0:35:59.660,0:36:03.140
She has been in the church since last Sunday.

0:36:03.140,0:36:04.920
She has been in the church.

0:36:04.920,0:36:06.820
So, I needed to bring you out.

0:36:06.820,0:36:12.600
I was not supposed to bring you out - but I needed to tell the world that all this is your past.

0:36:12.600,0:36:14.520
So please, thank you very much.

0:36:14.520,0:36:16.080
You go and have your seat.

0:36:16.080,0:36:18.240
It is no longer anything to you.

0:36:18.240,0:36:25.540
If you people have anything in common like house, money or whatever, we will iron it out.

0:36:25.540,0:36:31.140
That kind of relationship of husband and wife - God is not aware.

0:36:31.140,0:36:34.920
So, my brother, mummy - thank you for coming.

0:36:34.920,0:36:37.700
We thank God - satan is a liar.

0:36:37.700,0:36:40.200
My brother is free now.

0:36:40.200,0:36:46.420
My sister too, the former wife is here.

0:36:46.420,0:36:52.380
We told them after the service that this marriage cannot come together again.

0:36:52.380,0:36:56.720
You two cannot come together as a husband and wife.

0:36:56.720,0:37:00.900
The revelation God has given to me is: "Take care of your children."

0:37:00.900,0:37:01.940
OK?

0:37:01.940,0:37:08.180
If anybody is telling you that there is no link between you and this little girl,

0:37:08.180,0:37:13.100
the person doesn't want good for you.

0:37:13.100,0:37:18.860
It is just some of the things that happened to you in the past.

0:37:18.860,0:37:21.440
This is why I'm here to tell momma.

0:37:21.440,0:38:20.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:38:20.560,0:38:25.840
What I'm saying - this is the mother of this little girl.

0:38:25.840,0:38:28.760
Because last Sunday we were asking the little girl.

0:38:28.760,0:38:31.680
She said, "No, this is not my mother. I don't know her".

0:38:31.680,0:38:33.340
I said it was her mother.

0:38:33.340,0:38:36.700
Now, God has forgiven us and we are delivered.

0:38:36.700,0:38:38.520
Old things have passed away.

0:38:38.520,0:38:41.100
We should put everything behind us.

0:38:41.100,0:38:43.340
She should have access to her daughter.

0:38:43.340,0:38:44.420
OK?

0:38:44.420,0:38:50.960
Last Sunday the mother was asking if she could be with her daughter, I said, "No,  we need to see momma".

0:38:50.960,0:38:53.660
Momma is the one that has been with the daughter.

0:38:53.660,0:38:57.300
I needed to meet momma before this kind of agreement can come.

0:38:57.300,0:39:00.080
Momma needs to be aware of what is on the ground.

0:39:00.080,0:39:01.720
Momma is here.

0:39:01.720,0:39:03.960
We thank God and we thank momma.

0:39:03.960,0:39:06.900
Thank God, momma is a pastor.

0:39:06.900,0:39:08.360
This is a pastor.

0:39:08.360,0:39:11.440
Praise the Lord!

0:39:11.440,0:39:12.980
Thank you.

0:39:12.980,0:39:16.300
And you know that forgiveness gives us future.

0:39:16.300,0:39:29.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:29.460,0:39:31.220
So, what else again?

0:39:31.220,0:39:35.600
Whether their sin is big or small - forgive them.

0:39:35.600,0:39:39.280
Big sin, small sin - forgive them.

0:39:39.280,0:39:43.140
Therefore - big, bigger, biggest sin - forgive them.

0:39:43.140,0:39:44.180
So, that is it.

0:39:44.180,0:39:47.940
Forgive them - this includes you and me.

0:39:47.940,0:39:50.160
That it is - we put everything behind us.

0:39:50.160,0:39:52.640
So, the wife has to have access to her daughter.

0:39:52.640,0:39:57.040
So, we let the daughter know that this is her mother.

0:39:57.040,0:39:59.880
Till now, she has been grumbling.

0:39:59.880,0:40:04.220
After the service we will meet and eat together at the round table.

0:40:04.220,0:40:11.500
This kind of meeting is not to marry her or him but to acknowledge that this is her mother.

0:40:11.500,0:40:15.260
The mother should have access to her daughter.

0:40:15.260,0:40:17.940
There is another secret - something is going on.

0:40:17.940,0:40:20.000
This little one...

0:40:20.000,0:40:27.460
I say that as a man of God: if somebody is telling us something, we should not listen to him or to her.

0:40:27.460,0:40:30.880
Their evidence is nothing to go by.

0:40:30.880,0:40:34.040
It is God who we should listen to.

0:40:34.040,0:40:37.120
He is the father of this girl.

0:40:37.120,0:40:41.480
I am telling you - he is the father.

0:40:41.480,0:40:45.920
I am not listening to her mum, the woman there - I can't listen to her.

0:40:45.920,0:40:49.480
His evidence too - it is nothing to go by.

0:40:49.480,0:40:53.320
But God - that is evidence from God - he is the father.

0:40:53.320,0:40:56.840
Take care of this girl. The same way as you take care of this daughter.

0:40:56.840,0:41:02.200
Like I have said - it is all what God demands to open the door of the future.

0:41:02.200,0:41:03.780
How are you?
What's your name?

0:41:03.780,0:41:04.600
Victory.

0:41:04.600,0:41:06.200
You are the mother?

0:41:06.200,0:41:08.040
OK, thank you for coming.

0:41:08.040,0:41:12.760
I am happy for your coming here today.

0:41:12.760,0:41:19.240
Momma there and momma here - we have to be very careful about the issue of this marriage.

0:41:19.240,0:41:21.320
Whatever God says is final.

0:41:21.320,0:41:22.140
OK?

0:41:22.140,0:41:28.260
You have done your own marriage and this is their own.

0:41:28.260,0:41:31.380
Whatever situation that is at hand, let us ask God.

0:41:31.380,0:41:32.340
OK?

0:41:32.340,0:41:38.100
This is why I want to meet you after the service and to have a meeting with you people.

0:41:38.100,0:41:43.780
We are not having this meeting so that the two of them can get back together - no, there is nothing like that.

0:41:43.780,0:41:47.160
It is about the acceptance of this little girl.

0:41:47.160,0:41:50.160
The mother should also have access to the daughter.

0:41:50.160,0:41:51.720
So, thank you very much.

0:41:51.720,0:41:52.640
OK?

0:41:52.640,0:41:55.540
That is the next meeting immediately after the service.

0:41:55.540,0:41:57.660
OK, thank you, Momma.

0:41:57.660,0:41:59.320
Thank you for coming here.

0:41:59.320,0:42:02.000
Little one.

0:42:02.000,0:42:09.660
And this little one needs deliverance and maybe we will do that, OK?

0:42:09.660,0:42:13.100
Give me your hand.

0:42:13.100,0:42:15.920
How are you?
Thank you very much.

0:42:15.920,0:42:17.380
Come on, sit down.
Thank you.

0:42:32.320,0:42:39.140
These are my children, my wife, my mother and my mother-in-law.

0:42:39.140,0:42:45.120
I want to thank God for how He intervened in my issues.

0:42:45.120,0:42:53.860
Earlier, before I came to The SCOAN, I had spiritual problems and setback in my business.

0:42:53.860,0:43:00.520
When I came to this church, the man of God prophesied to me that I was an occultist when I was in school,

0:43:00.520,0:43:03.660
and this has really affected my business.

0:43:03.660,0:43:07.360
This also affected my life because I was not delivered.

0:43:07.360,0:43:11.680
That day, God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver me.

0:43:11.680,0:43:16.200
After the deliverance, I have seen the mighty hand of God on me.

0:43:16.200,0:43:17.240
Glory be to Jesus Christ.

0:43:17.240,0:43:18.740
We thank God for what He has done in your life.

0:43:18.740,0:43:22.940
We just want to, for the benefit of those who are watching us today for the first time...

0:43:22.940,0:43:27.080
You mentioned that came to The SCOAN and you received a message of prophecy

0:43:27.080,0:43:31.320
from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, mentioning that you were an occultist in the past.

0:43:31.320,0:43:37.780
Could you just put a bit of light on this and explain, in confirmation of this prophecy, how it was true in your life.

0:43:37.780,0:43:40.020
Yes, I can confirm this to be true.

0:43:40.020,0:43:44.020
The man of God spoke to me, saying that I was an occultist in my school days.

0:43:44.020,0:43:46.140
It all happened when I was around 13 years old.

0:43:46.140,0:43:52.620
My grandmother called me and began to tell me about my past lifestyle.

0:43:52.620,0:43:59.920
When I was young, they took me to some herbalists to initiate me into some spirits.

0:43:59.920,0:44:03.520
I was a still-born baby and they didn't want that anything would happen to me.

0:44:03.520,0:44:10.220
As I was growing up, I began to see myself mingling with people, using spirits to control people -

0:44:10.220,0:44:14.660
whatever I said would come to pass - so I believed this spirit was helping me,

0:44:14.660,0:44:18.780
not knowing that this spirit was causing harm to my destiny.

0:44:18.780,0:44:24.180
I didn't know about it till the moment I came to The SCOAN and the man of God prophesied to me

0:44:24.180,0:44:27.840
that this was really affecting my life.

0:44:27.840,0:44:30.980
He prayed for me and delivered me that day.

0:44:30.980,0:44:32.900
Glory be to Jesus Christ.

0:44:32.900,0:44:39.760
After your deliverance from that spirit of occultism, that had really been affecting your life and your business,

0:44:39.760,0:44:44.040
as you mentioned - could you tell us how did you feel immediately after your deliverance?

0:44:44.040,0:44:52.360
Yes, I can confirm this to be true that after the man of God delivered me I have been seeing light in my life.

0:44:52.360,0:44:55.020
Most of the nightmares I used to have - they are no more.

0:44:55.020,0:45:02.180
I feel renewed and I see the light of God being restored in my life.

0:45:02.180,0:45:02.800
Thank you very much.

0:45:02.800,0:45:06.500
Now, after you received your deliverance at The SCOAN

0:45:06.500,0:45:13.400
and the man of God invited these people standing next to you, can you explain to us what is the purpose of all this?

0:45:13.400,0:45:17.840
The prophecy about the people standing here -

0:45:17.840,0:45:25.040
the prophecy about my daughter that I had disowned since birth and denied to be her father.

0:45:25.040,0:45:36.060
When the man of God intervened, he sought the face of God, and I learned that she is my legitimate daughter.

0:45:36.060,0:45:42.400
God has really used His prophet to join me with my children.

0:45:42.400,0:45:49.940
Today they are together with me and I will be going home with them, staying as a family.

0:45:49.940,0:45:52.420
Wow, we thank God for what He has done in your life.

0:45:52.420,0:45:59.280
For the benefit of those watching you - you mentioned that after your deliverance the man of God met you

0:45:59.280,0:46:05.480
and told you that there was a daughter that you need to take care of and pay the necessary responsibilities too.

0:46:05.480,0:46:11.400
The man of God made me to understand that there was an abandoned daughter that I need to take care of

0:46:11.400,0:46:15.860
and take up the responsibility, so that my future would be brighter.

0:46:15.860,0:46:19.500
He invited the mother to bring the daughter to me.

0:46:19.500,0:46:22.740
He sought the face of God and resolved the issue.

0:46:22.740,0:46:27.800
These are the children that God restored back to me.

0:46:27.800,0:46:32.380
The very girl you are talking about - can you point her out and tell us her name?

0:46:32.380,0:46:37.040
Yeah, this is the daughter the man of God has spoken about - Victory by name.

0:46:37.040,0:46:42.160
By the grace of God, she was brought to me to be my legitimate daughter.

0:46:42.160,0:46:46.940
Can you explain to us where was your daughter all this time.

0:46:46.940,0:46:52.560
Yes, my daughter has been with her mother since birth.

0:46:52.560,0:46:54.040
I was informed that she was pregnant.

0:46:54.040,0:47:00.260
I denied it and said then that I did not know anything about the pregnancy - this led to a big problem.

0:47:00.260,0:47:06.220
But by the almighty hand of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua was able to put light into this matter.

0:47:06.220,0:47:12.560
He made me to understand that the girl was my biological daughter.

0:47:12.560,0:47:18.380
By the grace of God I was able to see all the indices - everything indicates that she is my daughter.

0:47:18.380,0:47:23.540
It was the problem I had in the past that made me to deny her.

0:47:23.540,0:47:26.880
OK, glory be to Jesus Christ.

0:47:26.880,0:47:30.120
We thank God for all the wonderful things He has done in your life.

0:47:30.120,0:47:33.800
Now that you are here with your two daughters,

0:47:33.800,0:47:39.500
could you tell us their names and what your plan is for your daughters.

0:47:39.500,0:47:45.640
Yes, my daughters that are here: this is Victory Adisa and this is Precious Adisa.

0:47:45.640,0:47:51.580
By the grace of God, now I prepare myself to take them home to take up my responsibilities, to sponsor them,

0:47:51.580,0:47:57.400
to send them to better schools, and take up all necessary obligations.

0:47:57.400,0:48:03.160
What are you going to do now, upon receiving this wonderful message of prophecy and directions

0:48:03.160,0:48:04.660
you received from the man of God?

0:48:04.660,0:48:07.600
Could you tell us what is your plan for yourself now?

0:48:07.600,0:48:13.180
Yes. The man of God has told me in the prophecy that God created me to be great in life.

0:48:13.180,0:48:14.820
He paid a homage to me.

0:48:14.820,0:48:20.660
He said I was born to be a ruler. Therefore, I'm not to be suffering.

0:48:20.660,0:48:28.040
Now, I prepare myself to take care of my business, to put all my intellect into it so that the future can be brighter.

0:48:28.040,0:48:33.180
Right now, by the grace of God, I will abandon anything concerning women,

0:48:33.180,0:48:39.560
and I will take care of my business, so that the future can be better.

0:48:39.560,0:48:43.620
We thank God for this wonderful revelation, that God Almighty has used Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:48:43.620,0:48:45.280
to bring about in your life.

0:48:45.280,0:48:49.300
We believe sincerely as you will take this instruction in righteousness and faith,

0:48:49.300,0:48:53.000
that the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' mighty name.

0:48:53.000,0:48:54.400
Amen.

0:48:54.400,0:48:58.640
We also want to listen to the next person.

0:48:58.640,0:49:04.020
Mr Samuel Adisa & Family
Family Reconciled After Prophecy

0:49:04.020,0:49:07.380
Madam, we welcome you today to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.

0:49:07.380,0:49:09.540
Can you introduce yourself to us?

0:49:09.540,0:49:12.380
My name is Mary Adolor.

0:49:12.380,0:49:18.460
Could you introduce to us the people standing next to you and tell us what God Almighty has done in you life.

0:49:18.460,0:49:24.080
This one here is my daughter Victory Samuel Adisa

0:49:24.080,0:49:28.620
and this is Precious Samuel Adisa - they are my children.

0:49:28.620,0:49:32.840
This is the situation God rescued me from:

0:49:32.840,0:49:40.480
I was pregnant with this girl for a month and 2 weeks, when I had a misunderstanding with my husband,

0:49:40.480,0:49:43.580
and he sent me away from his house.

0:49:43.580,0:49:48.620
I packed my things and came back to my parents' house.

0:49:48.620,0:49:50.240
Along the line...

0:49:50.240,0:49:56.220
When I got to the village, I found out that I was pregnant.

0:49:56.220,0:50:02.900
I called him and told him that I left his house being pregnant for a month and 2 weeks.

0:50:02.900,0:50:08.440
He told me that he was not responsible for that and that I should go and look for the responsible person.

0:50:08.440,0:50:12.940
I told him that I was sure that I had left his house being pregnant.

0:50:12.940,0:50:15.540
We argued about it and he denied the child.

0:50:15.540,0:50:19.840
I had nothing else to say than calling my God day and night.

0:50:19.840,0:50:23.600
I stayed with my mother in the village doing nothing.

0:50:23.600,0:50:30.780
After nine months of pregnancy I gave birth to Victory.

0:50:30.780,0:50:36.680
When I gave birth to Victory, I called the mum of my husband.

0:50:36.680,0:50:39.300
She said that she was happy.

0:50:39.300,0:50:43.640
She asked me why I hadn't informed her earlier.

0:50:43.640,0:50:51.440
I answered that there was a problem - I called her son and he denied responsibility for the pregnancy.

0:50:51.440,0:50:55.040
She said, "OK" - she was somehow happy.

0:50:55.040,0:51:05.380
Later, I received a call from her - she said that her son indeed denied the responsibility for the pregnancy.

0:51:05.380,0:51:07.460
I asked, "Is it what he told you?"
She said, "Yes".

0:51:07.460,0:51:12.580
I said, "OK, no problem - if he says so, but a time will come when he will come to look for her".

0:51:12.580,0:51:14.780
That is what I said to myself.

0:51:14.780,0:51:21.020
I said, "The time will come that he will come and look for her because I know he is the father".

0:51:21.020,0:51:22.360
She said, "OK".

0:51:22.360,0:51:27.220
When I called him again, he did not respond.

0:51:27.220,0:51:36.080
While I was in the village, there was no money because I wasn't doing anything - I was just trying to survive,

0:51:36.080,0:51:37.660
and to take care of this girl.

0:51:37.660,0:51:47.500
Because of the financial situation I would still call him to support me, to send money to me.

0:51:47.500,0:51:54.000
He wouldn't care and say that he would not come - so I gave up and forgot about it.

0:51:54.000,0:52:00.520
In January, the following year, my younger brother came to the village and met me.

0:52:00.520,0:52:02.640
He asked what I was doing in the village.

0:52:02.640,0:52:06.260
He was working in Lagos, and he just came to the village.

0:52:06.260,0:52:10.400
He saw the situation I was in and he said he was not happy about it.

0:52:10.400,0:52:13.720
He asked if I would come to Akwa Ibom.

0:52:13.720,0:52:21.040
I said, "Why not", because I was not used to live in the village - it was the first time I came back there.

0:52:21.040,0:52:23.460
He said I should come to Akwa Ibom with him.

0:52:23.460,0:52:28.800
He said that after he arrives in Akwa Ibom, he will look for an accommodation for me.

0:52:28.800,0:52:30.140
I said, "OK, no problem".

0:52:30.140,0:52:35.580
Having arrived there, he found an accommodation and he sent money to my account.

0:52:35.580,0:52:38.420
He said I should come to Akwa Ibom.

0:52:38.420,0:52:39.860
I said, "OK".

0:52:39.860,0:52:46.860
When I arrived there, he paid the 2-years rent for my room.

0:52:46.860,0:52:51.860
He started buying things and food, he started helping me.

0:52:51.860,0:52:54.600
That is how I started anew.

0:52:54.600,0:53:01.700
When my daughter was 1 year and 6 months old, my brother noticed that she was "sharp" and could talk.

0:53:01.700,0:53:03.900
He asked, "Why don't we look for a school for her?"

0:53:03.900,0:53:11.000
I said, "OK, but I don't have anything doing and I don't want to be a burden to you".

0:53:11.000,0:53:12.780
He said that I should send her to school.

0:53:12.780,0:53:17.660
There was one nearby school on my street - I went there and got admission for her.

0:53:17.660,0:53:21.180
She started to go to that school when she was 1 year and 6 months old.

0:53:21.180,0:53:25.620
I knew that staying home, doing nothing would not help me.

0:53:25.620,0:53:27.840
My brother wouldn't be there for me everyday.

0:53:27.840,0:53:29.960
He asked why I couldn't look for something to do.

0:53:29.960,0:53:34.220
I said, "Good. If you can also help with that, I will appreciate it".

0:53:34.220,0:53:41.420
He looked for a shop and gave me some money to start some business with it,

0:53:41.420,0:53:44.080
so I would be able to take care of the girl.

0:53:44.080,0:53:45.700
That is what he did for me.

0:53:45.700,0:53:49.440
My younger brother - I appreciate his help.

0:53:49.440,0:53:51.640
I thank God for what he did for me.

0:53:51.640,0:53:55.980
When I started the business, everything was going fine.

0:53:55.980,0:54:02.880
With the little money he gave me to start up, my business was going fine.

0:54:02.880,0:54:04.260
It was two years ago...

0:54:04.260,0:54:09.460
In 2014, I don't know what happened - my business collapsed.

0:54:09.460,0:54:13.420
That was 2014 - my business collapsed.

0:54:13.420,0:54:15.440
In fact, everything about me.

0:54:15.440,0:54:19.340
I was not able to pay her school fees anymore.

0:54:19.340,0:54:24.980
I started asking God, "God, what did I do wrong, so all this is happening to me?"

0:54:24.980,0:54:29.660
In the same year I lost my dad.

0:54:29.660,0:54:35.700
After the burial, in 2015 I tried to manage my life again.

0:54:35.700,0:54:38.740
I didn't know that this was God's will for me

0:54:38.740,0:54:47.340
because while I had money, I did not remember to call on God.

0:54:47.340,0:54:50.500
I put the loan I had taken into the business.

0:54:50.500,0:54:55.220
I could not earn money - everything went again like that.

0:54:55.220,0:54:58.280
That is when I started seeking the face of God.

0:54:58.280,0:55:05.520
I received a call from The SCOAN.

0:55:05.520,0:55:11.020
The woman told me that the man of God wanted to see me and that I should come to Lagos.

0:55:11.020,0:55:16.700
I said that I was not the one she was looking for.

0:55:16.700,0:55:18.120
She asked, "Is this Mary?"

0:55:18.120,0:55:26.500
At the beginning I said, "No", because I thought it was somebody I owed money.

0:55:26.500,0:55:31.100
I said I was not Mary to the person who called me.

0:55:31.100,0:55:35.040
She said, "No, I know that I am speaking to Mary".

0:55:35.040,0:55:39.860
I said, "No. I am not the one. It is my sister, who sometimes uses this number".

0:55:39.860,0:55:42.300
She said, "OK. How can I get her?"

0:55:42.300,0:55:45.940
I said, "OK, I will pass the message to her so you can talk to her."

0:55:45.940,0:55:49.200
She said, "Please, I need to talk to her".

0:55:49.200,0:55:50.160
I said, "OK".

0:55:50.160,0:55:53.460
After 15 minutes I got another call.

0:55:53.460,0:55:55.960
I was asked to call back.

0:55:55.960,0:55:57.720
I said, "Hello".
She said, "Hello."

0:55:57.720,0:56:03.960
I introduced myself as Mary - may God forgive me because of my previous lie.

0:56:03.960,0:56:06.600
I said, "This is Mary speaking".

0:56:06.600,0:56:11.700
She said, "OK. I couldn't reach you earlier on".

0:56:11.700,0:56:15.640
I said that my sister just came and gave me the information.

0:56:15.640,0:56:20.280
She asked me to come down to The SCOAN.

0:56:20.280,0:56:32.320
I said, "No. I am not the one. I heard about The SCOAN, but I have never been there.

0:56:32.320,0:56:36.340
I don't even dream of coming there".

0:56:36.340,0:56:37.240
She said I should come.

0:56:37.240,0:56:42.480
I said, "Please, check the number - I'm not the one. It is a wrong number".

0:56:42.480,0:56:44.960
She called me back, "Are you not Mary Adolor?"

0:56:44.960,0:56:46.100
I said, "This is me".

0:56:46.100,0:56:49.380
She said I was the one they wanted to see.

0:56:49.380,0:56:54.600
She didn't let me know that my husband was here.

0:56:54.600,0:56:58.240
I called my sister.

0:56:58.240,0:57:02.880
I told her that I received a call and they said I should come to The SCOAN.

0:57:02.880,0:57:05.440
She said, "No. Are you sure?"

0:57:05.440,0:57:11.800
I said, "Maybe someone wants to set me up, because I know what type of man my husband is".

0:57:11.800,0:57:13.480
I said I was not going.

0:57:13.480,0:57:17.760
I thought that maybe it was somebody else calling from Lagos.

0:57:17.760,0:57:20.160
She said that I should text the number to her.

0:57:20.160,0:57:23.060
I text the number to my sister.

0:57:23.060,0:57:26.100
When she called the number, she confirmed it to be from The SCOAN.

0:57:26.100,0:57:31.120
I then decided to come on Sunday or Monday.

0:57:31.120,0:57:36.400
I called The SCOAN - she told me that they wanted to see me on Saturday.

0:57:36.400,0:57:41.520
I said, "OK. I need to take a night bus on Friday night".

0:57:41.520,0:57:45.260
I arrived in Lagos on Saturday morning.

0:57:45.260,0:57:48.200
That is how I found myself in this place.

0:57:48.200,0:57:55.140
When I came to the church on Sunday, they called Samuel out and asked him questions about his daughter.

0:57:55.140,0:57:57.160
They asked him for how long he hadn't seen his daughter.

0:57:57.160,0:58:00.460
He said, "For the past nine years".

0:58:00.460,0:58:02.360
They asked him, "Where do you think the woman is now?"

0:58:02.360,0:58:05.000
He said that she was far away.

0:58:05.000,0:58:10.620
The man of God asked him then, "What if you see your wife now?"

0:58:10.620,0:58:12.220
He was shocked.

0:58:12.220,0:58:15.180
He couldn't believe that I was around.

0:58:15.180,0:58:17.300
Then, they said I should come out.

0:58:17.300,0:58:19.840
Then, he saw me and his daughter.

0:58:19.840,0:58:26.100
When he saw me, he was surprised to see me in the church.

0:58:26.100,0:58:28.980
When he saw the daughter, they then asked him questions.

0:58:28.980,0:58:33.640
They brought my first daughter - Precious - they asked her a question,

0:58:33.640,0:58:35.920
"Who is this woman to you? Is she you mother?"

0:58:35.920,0:58:39.160
She said, "No." That I was not her mother.

0:58:39.160,0:58:40.560
They asked her, "Who is she to you?"

0:58:40.560,0:58:43.540
She said she didn't know me.

0:58:43.540,0:58:45.280
The man of God said, "OK".

0:58:45.280,0:58:49.120
He asked my husband who my second daughter was to him.

0:58:49.120,0:58:58.300
He said he didn't know her, that Victory wasn't his daughter and he didn't know anything about her.

0:58:58.300,0:59:00.400
That is how it all happened on that Sunday.

0:59:00.400,0:59:07.920
We understand that after that, the man of God took his time to give words of counselling

0:59:07.920,0:59:13.540
and gave God's point of view concerning these children.

0:59:13.540,0:59:16.520
We understand the man of God prayed for you for your deliverance.

0:59:16.520,0:59:18.060
He prayed for us for our deliverance.

0:59:18.060,0:59:24.000
After the deliverance and the prayer - I thank God because I see changes.

0:59:24.000,0:59:29.080
When I came the first time, my husband didn't even want to see or call me.

0:59:29.080,0:59:32.080
He was seriously angry with me, seeing me in the church.

0:59:32.080,0:59:40.000
After the prayer and deliverance - the following morning I received a call from him.

0:59:40.000,0:59:44.500
He asked about me and my daughter and how we were doing.

0:59:44.500,0:59:45.720
I said we were fine.

0:59:45.720,0:59:53.620
He asked about our hotel and if we wanted to change it.

0:59:53.620,0:59:55.060
I said that we were comfortable.

0:59:55.060,1:00:04.720
I thank God so much because we, especially our daughters, met.

1:00:04.720,1:00:06.040
They didn't know each other.

1:00:06.040,1:00:08.960
Victory didn't know Precious, and Precious didn't know Victory.

1:00:08.960,1:00:11.120
Precious didn't even know me as her mother.

1:00:11.120,1:00:15.080
But now, we are all united together as a family.

1:00:15.080,1:00:22.160
I thank God so much, because He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to bring back this family again.

1:00:22.160,1:00:24.780
We thank God for what He has done in your life.

1:00:24.780,1:00:30.560
We really want to encourage you that as you continue staying obedient to the instruction of righteousness,

1:00:30.560,1:00:35.000
that the man of God has given, that the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.

1:00:35.000,1:00:36.100
Amen.

1:00:36.100,1:00:39.280
We also want to listen to our mothers.

1:00:39.280,1:00:44.680
I am Philomena Adolor.

1:00:44.680,1:00:47.460
I am coming from Edo State.

1:00:47.460,1:00:50.780
I thank God today for the life of my daughter.

1:00:50.780,1:00:53.220
I'm the mother of Mary.

1:00:53.220,1:01:03.440
I thank God - my coming to the SCOAN is a blessing to me, because the man of God has made me know that...

1:01:03.440,1:01:15.860
I thank God for answering me.

1:01:15.860,1:01:23.080
My granddaughter that was abandoned by her father - he came back to claim his daughter.

1:01:23.080,1:01:25.460
For that I give glory to God.

1:01:25.460,1:01:30.760
I knew that one day God would arrest him.

1:01:30.760,1:01:37.820
We were talking about this matter for a long time.

1:01:37.820,1:01:39.480
Today, we thank God for it.

1:01:39.480,1:01:49.180
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has settled the issue and made us to be one again as a family.

1:01:49.180,1:01:50.620
We thank God today.

1:01:50.620,1:01:59.820
Now, Victory knows her mother and Precious knows her father.

1:01:59.820,1:02:03.220
For that we thank God - we give glory to God.

1:02:03.220,1:02:12.600
We also thank the man of God.

1:02:12.600,1:02:17.960
We understand that it was the man of God who invited you to come down from your State

1:02:17.960,1:02:24.140
to attend the Sunday Service, for you to witness what God Almighty has done for your grandchildren

1:02:24.140,1:02:26.780
and for your daughter.

1:02:26.780,1:02:34.020
On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua we are here presenting you with the cash sum of N100 000

1:02:34.020,1:02:40.780

This is on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners, and we bless God for that.

1:02:45.800,1:02:54.580
I thank the man of God. God will give him more grace.

1:02:54.580,1:03:00.940
I thank God today for what He has done for me. It was not easy. Thank you.

1:03:00.940,1:03:04.460
My name is Adisa Mary.

1:03:04.460,1:03:07.560
My son is Adisa Samuel.

1:03:07.560,1:03:19.720
I give all glory to the Lord Almighty for all He has done in my life and my son's life.

1:03:19.720,1:03:31.560
I thank God for all. What was spoilt before, the God of T.B. Joshua has turned it to good.

1:03:31.560,1:03:33.980
I thank God for everything.

1:03:33.980,1:03:39.900
He has done good to me, He has brought everything to good.

1:03:39.900,1:03:42.160
I thank God for that.

1:03:42.160,1:03:43.060
We thank God.

1:03:43.060,1:03:50.040
We understand that it was Prophet T.B Joshua that invited you to come down from your State

1:03:50.040,1:03:59.740

I thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:04:21.220,1:04:26.800
I thank God for his support to me.

1:04:26.800,1:04:32.220
I pray that the Lord will continue to support the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:04:32.220,1:04:36.200
and everything he lays his hand upon.

1:04:36.200,1:04:39.060

My junior sister.

What is her name?

1:04:47.040,1:04:52.220

1:04:52.220,1:04:54.100
You mean that this is your sister?

1:04:54.100,1:04:55.260
Yes.

1:04:55.260,1:04:58.480
Have you ever met your sister before?

1:04:58.480,1:04:59.560
No.

1:04:59.560,1:05:03.300
You mean that here, in The SCOAN, you are meeting her for the first time?

1:05:03.300,1:05:06.160
Yes, sir.

1:05:06.160,1:05:07.860
We thank God for what He has done in your life.

1:05:07.860,1:05:12.620
We believe that for God Almighty to have brought you together,

1:05:12.620,1:05:16.300
He has wonderful things in store for you, in Jesus' name.

1:05:16.300,1:05:18.640
Amen.

1:05:18.640,1:05:21.360
We still want to listen to your sister as well.

1:05:39.160,1:05:40.940
Have you ever met her before?

1:05:40.940,1:05:42.800
No.

1:05:42.800,1:05:44.400
Yes.

1:05:44.400,1:05:46.740
Have you ever met her before coming here?

1:05:46.740,1:05:47.960
No.

1:05:47.960,1:05:51.720

1:06:02.800,1:06:03.800
Amen.

1:06:03.800,1:06:06.460
Now, on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,

1:06:06.460,1:06:09.460
we are here to present to you this cash gift of N200 000.

1:06:09.460,1:06:14.520
This is for your welfare, upkeep, and transport.

1:06:14.520,1:06:16.420
Emmanuel.

1:06:16.420,1:06:27.520
I thank God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for providing this money for me, my transport and welfare.

1:06:27.520,1:06:33.520
I thank God so much and I pray that Almighty God should continue making this ministry to grow,

1:06:33.520,1:06:35.740
in Jesus' name.

1:06:35.740,1:06:37.700
Thank You, Jesus.

1:06:37.700,1:06:39.160
Emmanuel.

1:06:39.160,1:06:42.800
We thank God for this wonderful thing God Almighty used T.B. Joshua to do

1:06:42.800,1:06:47.400
in your life and your children's lives, bringing them back together for the very first time.

1:06:47.400,1:06:50.320
They are going to grow up together now and have a wonderful life together.

1:06:50.320,1:06:54.480
Could you just once again, for the benefit of those watching us, tell us what you plan to do now,

1:06:54.480,1:06:57.460
concerning your own future and the future of your children?

1:06:57.460,1:06:59.040
Emmanuel.

1:06:59.040,1:07:04.220
I really thank God today, for what He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in my life.

1:07:04.220,1:07:10.040
He has used him to reconcile my family and bring my children together.

1:07:10.040,1:07:12.320
I am here together with my children now.

1:07:12.320,1:07:19.640
From now on, I will take up the responsibility of taking care of my two daughters -

1:07:19.640,1:07:23.460
to give them the best education so that they can have a good life.

1:07:23.460,1:07:28.280
By the grace of God, by the instruction of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

1:07:28.280,1:07:30.300
I'm taking them to my house now.

1:07:30.300,1:07:32.480
They will be staying with me.

1:07:32.480,1:07:42.900
By the grace of God, we will be able to understand ourselves better.

1:07:42.900,1:07:47.940
By the grace of God, after receiving directions and the prophecy from the man of God,

1:07:47.940,1:07:54.080
I will now go out into the world to prepare myself for a bigger business.

1:07:54.080,1:07:56.060
God had really been doing this in the past.

1:07:56.060,1:07:59.220
God had been blessing me in the past, until this problem happened.

1:07:59.220,1:08:04.880
By the grace of God, the man of God said that if I go and focus on my career, God is going to bless me

1:08:04.880,1:08:09.780
and I will come back with a big testimony.

1:08:09.780,1:08:12.560
I will face my future henceforth, by the grace of God.

1:08:12.560,1:08:22.900
I will not allow womanising, spirit of lust, and other unnecessary things to distract my focus.

1:08:22.900,1:08:24.320
Glory be to Jesus Christ.

1:08:24.320,1:08:26.740
We thank God for all He has done in your life.

1:08:26.740,1:08:28.160
Now, we are here...

1:08:28.160,1:08:34.460
Since you have given that promise that you are going to take care, and do your responsibility as a father,

1:08:34.460,1:08:38.540
the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent us to present this gift to you.

1:08:38.540,1:08:47.220
This is a cash gift of N320 000, given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV partners.

1:08:47.220,1:08:56.580
I give all the glory to God Almighty for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to intervene in my case.

1:08:56.580,1:09:01.460
I really bless God that the man of God intervened in my issue.

1:09:01.460,1:09:05.840
I believe I am the one supposed to pay him for the service rendered to me.

1:09:05.840,1:09:11.540
God has really used him to bless me again with the sum of N320 000 to take care of my children.

1:09:11.540,1:09:15.840
I believe my future will now be better and brighter, by the grace of God.

1:09:15.840,1:09:17.160
Glory be to Jesus Christ.

1:09:17.160,1:09:21.040
We thank God for this beautiful thing that God Almighty has done in this family.

1:09:21.040,1:09:23.160
We want to wish all of you the very best.

1:09:23.160,1:09:27.600
We believe that God Almighty will continue to dwell with you, as you will continue to

1:09:27.600,1:09:31.000
follow the instructions in righteousness given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:09:31.000,1:09:36.700
We believe, as your lives continue to be centred on the Word of God and on Christ - better is not good enough

1:09:36.700,1:09:39.840
but the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.

1:09:39.840,1:09:44.620
We also want to encourage you - make sure you stay close to Jesus Christ, and raise your children

1:09:44.620,1:09:49.500
in the way of the Lord so when they grow up, they will not depart from it, in Jesus' mighty name.

1:09:49.500,1:09:51.700
Amen.
Emmanuel.

1:09:51.700,1:09:54.960
Thank You, Jesus.
