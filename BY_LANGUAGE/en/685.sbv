Prophet T.B. Joshua At Paul And Silas' Prison in Philippi, Greece

0:00:07.920,0:00:15.640
The Lord said we should use here as a point of contact to pray for you and pray for the nations.

0:00:15.640,0:00:23.980
Anywhere you are right now, be with me by faith and receive.

0:00:23.980,0:00:29.540
By the covenant Word in my heart, I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:29.540,0:00:33.040
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:33.040,0:00:39.740
Just as Paul and Silas were released, be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:39.740,0:00:51.360
Whatever situation you are in, be it sickness, hardship, poverty, affliction,

0:00:51.360,0:00:56.000
isolation, rejection, depression, just name them -

0:00:56.000,0:01:04.120
By the covenant Word in my heart, I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:04.120,0:01:09.400
Here – a spiritual monument.

0:01:09.400,0:01:16.920
What you have read in the Bible about Paul and Silas, how they were imprisoned -

0:01:16.920,0:01:26.340
this is not just historic; it is real. Indeed, a place of the Bible, the land of the Bible.

0:01:26.340,0:01:31.040
Here we are.

0:01:31.040,0:01:44.200
Paul and Silas were released by the Word in their heart.

0:01:44.200,0:01:59.140
The Word in their heart became the key that opened the prison gate.

0:01:59.140,0:02:09.680
Be Thou in my heart – release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:09.680,0:02:18.360
Whatever way you might have been connected to satan, to demons by way of poverty,

0:02:18.360,0:02:29.580
sickness, disease, isolation, depression, unbelief – I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:29.580,0:02:35.900
Be set free!

0:02:35.900,0:02:39.440
I speak to the nations all over the world.

0:02:39.440,0:02:49.900
Troubled nations, in whatever area you are troubled, at war against one another, disunity,

0:02:49.900,0:02:58.520
hatred around the world, whatever way you, troubled nations,

0:02:58.520,0:03:04.980
trouble – I command you cease, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:04.980,0:03:15.820
I send a Word to my nation, you trouble, cease, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:15.820,0:03:21.260
I loose you, in the name of Jesus, from all troubles you are facing.

0:03:21.260,0:03:32.100
I say to you, you trouble, be thou loosed!

0:03:32.100,0:03:37.960
I release you from sickness and diseases, affliction – whatever!

0:03:37.960,0:03:49.640
The Bible said Paul and Silas prayed to God to comfort and support them in their trial.

0:03:49.640,0:03:51.960
Be comforted, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:51.960,0:03:55.200
Whatever area of your life, be comforted, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:55.200,0:04:00.480
Receive strength to go on and on.

0:04:00.480,0:04:01.680
Receive strength!

0:04:01.680,0:04:03.780
In your nation, receive strength!

0:04:03.780,0:04:10.680
I pray for you all that are with me in Spirit.

0:04:10.680,0:04:17.800
This is Paul and Silas’ prison.

0:04:17.800,0:04:25.600
It is in the Bible, if I may read in the Acts of the Apostles.

0:04:25.600,0:04:32.180
Acts 16:25 - ”About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God,

0:04:32.180,0:04:35.900
and the other prisoners were listening to them.

0:04:35.900,0:04:43.580
Suddenly, there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken.

0:04:43.580,0:05:05.100
At once, all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.”

0:05:05.100,0:05:10.880
Right now, chain of poverty, isolation, sickness, disease -

0:05:10.880,0:05:24.080
everyone’s chains right now, come loose, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:24.080,0:05:27.840
I release you from every chain.

0:05:27.840,0:05:36.500
Chain of poverty, isolation, whatever way he might have connected you to himself,

0:05:36.500,0:05:40.860
come loose, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:40.860,0:05:43.000
I break the chain, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:43.000,0:05:47.220
I can hear the chain loosing.

0:05:47.220,0:05:50.440
I can hear the noise of the chain loosing.

0:05:50.440,0:05:56.120
Be loosed, in the name of Jesus! Be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:56.120,0:06:00.420
By covenant Word, I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:06:00.420,0:06:02.260
Oh my God.

0:06:02.260,0:06:09.500
It’s as if I should not leave here because I can feel the presence of God.

0:06:09.500,0:06:12.900
I feel the presence of God more than ever before.

0:06:12.900,0:06:17.240
I want you to feel what I am feeling; the presence of God is all over!

0:06:17.240,0:06:21.540
The atmosphere is quite awesome.

0:06:21.540,0:06:33.760
There is so much trouble in the world: Family trouble, nation trouble, community trouble.

0:06:33.760,0:06:37.300
These are synonymous to satan.

0:06:37.300,0:06:43.920
Satan uses those things to connect people to himself.

0:06:43.920,0:06:47.940
I break that connection.

0:06:47.940,0:06:51.740
The word it uses here is clear.

0:06:51.740,0:06:59.920
Acts 16:26 – “At once, all the prison doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose.”

0:06:59.920,0:07:05.680
Whatever way satan might have connected you, whatever way satan might have dealt with you,

0:07:05.680,0:07:13.240
whatever way satan must have related with you, like I said, he is synonymous to trouble,

0:07:13.240,0:07:19.340
sickness, disease, affliction, isolation, barrenness – just name whatever -

0:07:19.340,0:07:24.240
all these troubles all over the world – satan is synonymous to them.

0:07:24.240,0:07:27.440
He is the architect; he is the manufacturer.

0:07:27.440,0:07:28.740
He produces them.

0:07:28.740,0:07:31.040
Satan and trouble.

0:07:31.040,0:07:32.960
Satan and affliction.

0:07:32.960,0:07:35.260
Satan and violence.

0:07:35.260,0:07:36.920
Satan and disease.

0:07:36.920,0:07:42.620
Satan and affliction, just name them – I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:07:42.620,0:07:45.440
Just like everyone here in the Bible.

0:07:45.440,0:07:51.800
Like it is written here, in Paul and Silas’ prison.

0:07:51.800,0:08:00.780
Acts 16:26 – “At once, all the prison doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose.”

0:08:00.780,0:08:08.580
Everyone’s chain, under the influence of my voice, come loose, in the name of Jesus!

0:08:08.580,0:08:09.620
Be disconnected!

0:08:09.620,0:08:19.720
I disconnect you from satan and all his evil, sickness and diseases, attacks, trials, affliction.

0:08:19.720,0:08:24.280
I disconnect you right now from all these, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:24.280,0:08:33.400
Acts 16:27 – “The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he draw his sword

0:08:33.400,0:08:40.080
and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.”

0:08:40.080,0:08:42.340
It is just a place we are talking about.

0:08:42.340,0:08:44.040
Viewers – I want to leave you.

0:08:44.040,0:08:50.860
Everyone under the influence of my voice, wherever you are, whatever you are doing,

0:08:50.860,0:08:56.360
see – I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:08:56.360,0:09:02.640
Come loose, you chain! Come loose, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:02.640,0:09:04.480
Loose, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:04.480,0:09:07.820
Whatever way satan might have connected you, be loosed, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:07.820,0:09:12.420
He is synonymous to trouble, sickness, disease and affliction.

0:09:12.420,0:09:15.380
Become loose! I loose you, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:15.380,0:09:17.100
I separate you, right now!

0:09:17.100,0:09:18.840
Be free, in the name of Jesus!

0:09:18.840,0:09:20.020
Thank you, Jesus!

0:09:20.020,0:09:21.740
Thank you once again.

0:09:21.740,0:09:25.600
I want to ask you, have you made to Heaven?

0:09:25.600,0:09:28.340
It is not too late.

0:09:28.340,0:09:32.400
You just have to surrender; give your life to Jesus!

0:09:32.400,0:09:41.000
Say, Lord Jesus, come into my heart today. Wash me with Your precious blood.

0:09:41.000,0:09:42.720
Save my soul.

0:09:42.720,0:09:45.180
You are the only One that can save my soul.

0:09:45.180,0:09:49.220
You are my Redeemer, Healer, Deliverer.

0:09:49.220,0:09:53.140
Thank You Lord, in Jesus Christ name. Amen.

0:09:53.140,0:09:54.300
Thank You Lord.
