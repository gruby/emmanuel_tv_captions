A lot has been said by people concerning how the church,

0:00:12.600,0:00:16.420
'Synagogue' came into being.

0:00:16.420,0:00:30.600
Some people questioned my foundation, my mentor,

0:00:30.600,0:00:38.900
my educational background and my calling as a man of God.

0:00:38.900,0:00:48.060
I am not showing this documentary because people questioned

0:00:48.060,0:00:58.360
my foundation, my background, my mentor,

0:00:58.360,0:01:05.760
my educational background, my calling as a man of God.

0:01:05.760,0:01:12.860
I am showing it because it is God's time. That is, it is an act of God.

0:01:17.260,0:01:19.880
Stay blessed and watch.

0:01:19.880,0:01:24.680
This is my story
Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:24.680,0:01:28.660
This is Prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer mountain.

0:01:28.660,0:01:36.240
Guided by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua came to this prayer mountain to seek the face of God.

0:01:36.240,0:01:41.580
Like prophets of old, he fasted and prayed for 40 days and 40 nights,

0:01:41.580,0:01:46.600
as prayer and fasting opens the door for God to enter.

0:01:46.600,0:01:49.180
It was at this very prayer mountain that Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:49.180,0:01:55.260
received divine anointing from God to start his ministry.

0:01:55.260,0:02:00.380
As he raises his hand to Heaven and then falls prostrating to pray,

0:02:00.380,0:02:05.700
he received a covenant from God concerning his calling.

0:02:05.700,0:02:12.880
Only he and God know the divine message that was revealed to him at that moment.

0:02:12.880,0:02:22.140
Concerning this experience, Prophet T.B. Joshua said, ""I was in a trance for three consecutive days.

0:02:22.140,0:02:27.880
Then, I saw a hand that pointed a Bible to my heart and the Bible entered my heart.

0:02:27.880,0:02:32.660
And my former heart immersed with the Bible immediately.

0:02:32.660,0:02:37.540
Then, the awareness came and I saw the apostles and prophets of old

0:02:37.540,0:02:40.180
with someone who I could not see his head

0:02:40.180,0:02:44.160
because he was tall to the Heaven and suspended

0:02:44.160,0:02:49.740
which I believe was our Lord Jesus Christ sitting in their midst.

0:02:49.740,0:02:52.380
I also saw myself in their midst.

0:02:52.380,0:02:58.460
After a while, I saw a hand of the same tall man. I could not behold his face

0:02:58.460,0:03:02.040
which was glittering with an unimaginable light.

0:03:02.040,0:03:07.960
But other apostles I could see their faces, particularly Apostles Peter and Paul,

0:03:07.960,0:03:11.120
Prophets Moses and Elijah, and others.

0:03:11.120,0:03:15.280
Their names were boldly written on their chest.

0:03:15.280,0:03:19.520
I heard a voice saying, "I am your God.

0:03:19.520,0:03:25.660
I am giving you a divine commission to go and carry out the work of the Heavenly Father".

0:03:25.660,0:03:30.760
At the same time, the same hand of the tall man gave me a small cross

0:03:30.760,0:03:34.660
and a big Bible - bigger than the one that entered my heart -

0:03:34.660,0:03:42.740
with a promise that as I keep pressing in His time and name, I will be given a bigger cross.

0:03:42.740,0:03:47.620
But if I fail, the opposite would occur.

0:03:47.620,0:03:52.620
I also heard a voice of the same tall man - I could not see his head -

0:03:52.620,0:03:58.760
saying, "I am the Lord your God, who was and who is, Jesus Christ,

0:03:58.760,0:04:03.700
giving orders to all the apostles and prophets".

0:04:03.700,0:04:10.340
The same voice said to me, "I would show you the wonderful ways, I would reveal myself through you

0:04:10.340,0:04:17.180
in teaching, preaching, miracles, signs and wonders for the salvation of souls".

0:04:17.180,0:04:26.140
Since then, I have been receiving in my vision every year according to my faithfulness to God, a bigger cross.

0:04:26.140,0:04:30.720
That means to me more responsibilities.

0:04:30.720,0:04:36.760
The Bible that entered my heart symbolizes Spirit and life, the Holy Spirit.

0:04:36.760,0:04:39.180
God's Word is Spirit and life. He does nothing without His Word.

0:04:41.740,0:04:44.660
The Book of Romans 8:16 says:

0:04:44.660,0:04:49.580
"God's Spirit joins Himself to our spirit to declare that we are children of God".

0:04:50.640,0:04:55.820
This divine anointing is performed by God Himself on all

0:04:55.820,0:04:59.700
who have the wonderful privilege of becoming His children.

0:04:59.700,0:05:04.240
It accompanies the conversion of those who trust in Christ.

0:05:04.240,0:05:08.620
Paul said that the Spirit indwells every believer and His presence is the guarantee of our future glory in Heaven

0:05:13.500,0:05:20.200
according to the Book of 2 Corinthians 1:21-22.

0:05:20.200,0:05:26.720
As a result of this indwelling presence, we have the ability to become more like Christ

0:05:26.720,0:05:33.080
in accordance with 2 Corinthians 3:17-18.

0:05:33.080,0:05:38.940
We who are born of God have no excuse of remaining as we are.

0:05:38.940,0:05:43.800
We can be increasingly conformed to the image of Christ

0:05:43.800,0:05:51.600
by yielding ourselves to God's anointing, the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our hearts.

0:05:51.600,0:05:55.720
Father, thank You for Your Spirit.

0:05:55.720,0:05:58.880
Fill us with His love and power.

0:05:58.880,0:06:05.400
Change us into Christ's own image day by day and hour by hour.

0:06:05.400,0:06:14.460
Remember, the Father gave us the Spirit to make us like His Son.

0:06:14.460,0:06:18.080
These are the pictures you will bring out and show people.

0:06:18.080,0:06:23.440
By the time the glory of God is revealed to the world and other countries start coming,

0:06:23.440,0:06:26.680
at that time, I will not have the time to come here again.

0:06:26.680,0:06:27.660
I will have my own prayer mountain"".

0:06:27.660,0:06:31.240
The man of God said that by the time the glory of God is revealed in his ministry

0:06:31.240,0:06:34.000
and people from other countries start coming,

0:06:34.000,0:06:37.720
he will no longer have the time to visit this prayer mountain.

0:06:37.720,0:06:45.820
And that in the future, he will have his own prayer mountain.

0:06:45.820,0:06:49.820
This is a picture of Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for people

0:06:49.820,0:06:57.400
after just having returned from a 40 day and 40 night fast at the prayer mountain.
