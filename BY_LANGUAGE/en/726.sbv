You are highly lifted up, Awesome God

0:00:11.840,0:00:23.860
You are highly lifted up, Mighty God

0:00:23.860,0:00:35.880
You are highly lifted up, Awesome God

0:00:35.880,0:00:45.940
You are highly lifted up, Mighty God

0:00:45.940,0:00:49.500
Thank you. You may be seated.

0:00:49.500,0:00:51.120
Thank you.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:53.540,0:00:55.040
Hallelujah!

0:00:55.040,0:00:56.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:56.720,0:00:59.640
Good morning.

0:00:59.640,0:01:01.640
Hallelujah!

0:01:01.640,0:01:04.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:04.700,0:01:12.100
Yes! As it should be by Divine will.

0:01:12.100,0:01:22.000
Let me wish you Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

0:01:22.000,0:01:26.560
So, you know we are dwelling on "your faith will not fail".

0:01:26.560,0:01:30.600
I think that is what we are actually dwelling on.

0:01:30.600,0:01:39.360
Some of our actions - we sometimes thought it's faith, but it is not Biblical faith.

0:01:39.360,0:01:46.960
I think it is very important to look into that faith that is not Biblical.

0:01:46.960,0:01:53.780
There is other faith: We have faith in faith, faith in yourself and faith in others

0:01:53.780,0:01:56.540
like I have mentioned the last time.

0:01:56.540,0:02:04.080
Looking at those things that are not Biblical faith - but we see them as faith.

0:02:04.080,0:02:06.420
They are not Biblical.

0:02:06.420,0:02:09.280
When you know those things that are not Biblical faith,

0:02:09.280,0:02:15.020
you have a better understanding of what Biblical faith is.

0:02:15.020,0:02:20.300
I will take you to the book of Acts 14.

0:02:20.300,0:02:33.440
Let's quickly look at just a snapping healing that took place when Paul was addressing a congregation.

0:02:33.440,0:02:40.340
(Acts 14:8) "In Lystra, there sat a man who was lame."

0:02:40.340,0:02:46.200
That is, a man was there who was lame - could not walk.

0:02:46.200,0:02:49.080
(Acts 14:8) "He had been that way from birth"

0:02:49.080,0:02:53.700
He was born with it, with lameness.

0:02:53.700,0:02:57.340
(Acts 14:8) "and had never walked."

0:02:57.340,0:03:00.500
That is, the man had never, never walked.

0:03:00.500,0:03:04.780
He was born lame right from birth.

0:03:04.780,0:03:07.480
(Acts 14:9) "He listened to Paul"

0:03:07.480,0:03:10.240
This man was listening to Paul.

0:03:10.240,0:03:12.900
(Acts 14:9) "as he was speaking."

0:03:12.900,0:03:17.780
A lame man right from birth.

0:03:17.780,0:03:21.360
(Acts 14:9) "He listened to Paul as he was speaking.

0:03:21.360,0:03:23.980
(Acts 14:9) "Paul looked directly at him,"

0:03:23.980,0:03:27.920
At a lame man - listen to that.

0:03:27.920,0:03:34.240
(Acts 14:9) "saw that he had faith to be healed."

0:03:34.240,0:03:37.400
Hmm, listen to that.

0:03:37.400,0:03:43.800
A lame man who was born lame.

0:03:43.800,0:03:52.320
He was in the meeting when Paul was addressing the congregants.

0:03:52.320,0:04:01.920
(Acts 14:9) "Paul looked directly at him, and saw that he had faith to be healed."

0:04:01.920,0:04:08.040
Do you have faith to receive? That is the question.

0:04:08.040,0:04:11.480
What faith are they talking about here?

0:04:11.480,0:04:16.000
Do you have faith to be set free?

0:04:16.000,0:04:19.660
It means all of this demands for your faith.

0:04:19.660,0:04:27.760
It is not all up to Jesus; certainly it is not all up to you.

0:04:27.760,0:04:36.780
Your genuine willingness plus Jesus' ability.

0:04:36.780,0:04:41.320
It demands for your faith.

0:04:41.320,0:04:49.860
Paul saw in him faith to be healed.

0:04:49.860,0:04:54.380
Do you have the faith?

0:04:54.380,0:04:58.100
Here, I stand as Paul.

0:04:58.100,0:05:08.520
Can I see faith to be healed, to be blessed, to be delivered in you?

0:05:08.520,0:05:12.400
Can I? In you?

0:05:12.400,0:05:15.580
It calls for a question.

0:05:15.580,0:05:28.320
(Acts 14:9) "Paul looked directly at him, and saw that he had faith to be healed."

0:05:28.320,0:05:34.660
If I look at you, can I see faith?

0:05:34.660,0:05:38.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:38.740,0:05:44.500
Will I see faith?

0:05:44.500,0:05:51.000
What you are calling faith today is mere feeling.

0:05:51.000,0:05:54.840
You are disturbed.

0:05:54.840,0:05:58.360
Your heart is not at its best.

0:05:58.360,0:06:03.100
That is why we allow you to dance - to wipe away those troubles.

0:06:03.100,0:06:06.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:06.920,0:06:09.600
You ask, "Why dancing in the church?

0:06:09.600,0:06:13.620
Why so much time for dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing?"

0:06:13.620,0:06:16.560
So that you can forget where you are coming from.

0:06:16.560,0:06:21.700
Because where you are coming from is full of debts, trouble.

0:06:21.700,0:06:29.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:29.560,0:06:38.800
Your heart can only be at its best when you are happy - peace of heart.

0:06:38.800,0:06:41.280
And God can only attract you,

0:06:41.280,0:06:48.900
the Spirit of God can only attract you - attract your heart - join himself to you -

0:06:48.900,0:06:52.340
to bless you - when your heart is at its best.

0:06:52.340,0:06:54.920
So much trouble.

0:06:54.920,0:06:58.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:58.120,0:07:06.280
We find ourselves in a generation without peace and patience.

0:07:06.280,0:07:11.600
There is no patience - hurry! hurry!

0:07:11.600,0:07:16.100
You time yourself. Imagine, you are coming to God, and you time yourself.

0:07:16.100,0:07:23.500
You have given a lot of appointments that "I'll be leaving here in 3 to 5 hours".

0:07:23.500,0:07:26.640
God is not one of those things.

0:07:26.640,0:07:29.040
You can time yourself to do business.

0:07:29.040,0:07:34.220
You can time yourself to visit a friend. You can time yourself to visit anyone.

0:07:34.220,0:07:36.360
You can time yourself to do anything.

0:07:36.360,0:07:39.420
But when it comes to God, disown it.

0:07:39.420,0:07:43.980
You don't time yourself to meet God.

0:07:43.980,0:07:48.640
This is where you miss the mark.

0:07:48.640,0:07:51.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:51.540,0:07:58.620
In our various places of worship, we have time at which we should leave,

0:07:58.620,0:08:02.660
time to worship, time to sing in, to sing out,

0:08:02.660,0:08:05.040
time to do this, time to do that.

0:08:05.040,0:08:10.180
We don't time God because it's all about inspiration from Heaven.

0:08:10.180,0:08:14.980
We don't instruct God, we don't tell God when to start, how to start,

0:08:14.980,0:08:18.980
when to stop, when to start, when to begin.

0:08:18.980,0:08:21.720
This is where you miss the mark.

0:08:21.720,0:08:24.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:24.820,0:08:27.740
"I'm here for a purpose",

0:08:27.740,0:08:31.400
"I am here to be healed", "I am here to be blessed".

0:08:31.400,0:08:32.940
This is bargaining.

0:08:32.940,0:08:35.120
You are bargaining with God.

0:08:35.120,0:08:37.200
Do you pay God?

0:08:37.200,0:08:44.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:44.600,0:08:48.240
"I'm here to be delivered today."

0:08:48.240,0:08:51.060
This is bargaining.

0:08:51.060,0:08:53.080
Simply a bribe.

0:08:53.080,0:08:57.280
Whatever you now give, seems to be a bribe.

0:08:57.280,0:08:59.200
That is corruption.

0:08:59.200,0:09:02.660
You take that corruption to the house of God.

0:09:02.660,0:09:04.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:04.940,0:09:08.520
Whatever you now give is, because you are here for a purpose.

0:09:08.520,0:09:16.660
Whatever you now give, is a way of saying, "I give this, You give me this".

0:09:16.660,0:09:22.340
We are all sitting as if we really mean business.

0:09:22.340,0:09:25.880
But it's because we don't have so much to do today.

0:09:25.880,0:09:28.660
Today is a free day, that is why you give it to God.

0:09:28.660,0:09:33.500
You only give to God what you do not need, time you do not need.

0:09:33.500,0:09:36.460
Your quality time - you can't give it to God.

0:09:36.460,0:09:42.140
You don't have any appointments today, that is why you are here.

0:09:42.140,0:09:47.540
You don't give your quality time to God.

0:09:47.540,0:09:52.500
If God continued to give you what He Himself did not need,

0:09:52.500,0:09:54.220
as you are giving change...

0:09:54.220,0:09:56.240
You know when you want to give your offering?

0:09:56.240,0:10:00.140
These are things you collected from the petrol station - change.

0:10:00.140,0:10:02.780
The money you collected from the conductor (public transport operators).

0:10:02.780,0:10:06.260
The money you collected from where you buy and sell.

0:10:06.260,0:10:09.260
That is the change you give to God.

0:10:09.260,0:10:13.680
If God continued to give you such change back in return -

0:10:13.680,0:10:17.280
what God did not need - what you do not need -

0:10:17.280,0:10:20.880
would you say He has blessed you?

0:10:20.880,0:10:26.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:26.960,0:10:30.680
You believe you are serving God.

0:10:30.680,0:10:39.120
Are you serving Him with your quality time, your quality strength?

0:10:39.120,0:10:45.840
Let's look at what is not Biblical faith.

0:10:45.840,0:10:50.980
We say faith, we have faith; but you need Biblical faith.

0:10:50.980,0:10:56.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:56.080,0:11:01.760
You deny everything. When they ask you, "What is your problem?",

0:11:01.760,0:11:04.040
you prefer to say a different thing.

0:11:04.040,0:11:08.260
You don't tell people - until you are about to die.

0:11:08.260,0:11:12.800
Getting to the point of death, you can say it out.

0:11:12.800,0:11:17.980
Or when the doctors reject you and say, "No, this is above us".

0:11:17.980,0:11:21.100
Then, you run to God.

0:11:21.100,0:11:28.380
You deny the existence of a problem.

0:11:28.380,0:11:35.620
Faith is not denial.

0:11:35.620,0:11:42.320
Faith does not deny the existence of a problem.

0:11:42.320,0:11:43.860
There is a problem.

0:11:43.860,0:11:52.860
Even the Bible says, "In this world there will be tribulations. Cheer up; I have overcome".

0:11:52.860,0:11:56.600
There is a problem! Why should you deny it?

0:11:56.600,0:11:58.980
You can't deny it!

0:11:58.980,0:12:01.880
Everyone has limitations.

0:12:01.880,0:12:06.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:06.320,0:12:09.400
Faith is not denial.

0:12:09.400,0:12:15.060
Faith does not deny the existence of a problem.

0:12:15.060,0:12:17.200
There is a problem!

0:12:17.200,0:12:20.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:20.380,0:12:24.660
Everybody has a medical report somewhere.

0:12:24.660,0:12:26.900
Your medical record.

0:12:26.900,0:12:31.320
But when you are getting to the point of death, you run to God.

0:12:31.320,0:12:33.660
You are ready to say, "This is what I have",

0:12:33.660,0:12:35.580
"This is my problem".

0:12:35.580,0:12:38.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:38.280,0:12:42.900
You say you are a Christian.

0:12:42.900,0:13:02.600
A person has to recognise he is sick before getting healed.

0:13:02.600,0:13:04.640
He is sick!

0:13:04.640,0:13:09.180
And run to the Healer, the Saviour, before getting healed!

0:13:09.180,0:13:13.480
But at what point do you recognise you are sick?

0:13:13.480,0:13:17.520
When all hope is lost.

0:13:17.520,0:13:22.500
When you have spent all your fortune.

0:13:22.500,0:13:29.900
At what point, do you recognise you are sick and run to Jesus?

0:13:29.900,0:13:34.760
When all hope is lost and everything is gone.

0:13:34.760,0:13:37.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:37.620,0:13:46.900
Confessing or not does not change the fact.

0:13:46.900,0:13:57.400
Knowing facts about God does not change your relationship with Him.

0:13:57.400,0:14:03.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:03.760,0:14:17.720
When you put the Word of God to work, eventually your circumstances are subject to change.

0:14:17.720,0:14:21.100
Put to work the Word of God.

0:14:21.100,0:14:24.220
Put to work.

0:14:24.220,0:14:29.600
Like last week when I was moving around - if not for the gift of prophecy -

0:14:29.600,0:14:36.280
meeting some people, they would come here and say, "I have fever".

0:14:36.280,0:14:45.660
By the time I am praying, I realise that this is HIV 1 and 2.

0:14:45.660,0:14:53.560
Until they get to the point of death, before they say, "Jesus is Lord!",

0:14:53.560,0:14:57.200
"He is my Healer".

0:14:57.200,0:15:02.680
Faith is not imitation, which is common among us.

0:15:02.680,0:15:06.920
Faith is NOT imitation!

0:15:06.920,0:15:11.400
It cannot be imitated!

0:15:11.400,0:15:29.760
It must arise in each person's heart, based on the Word of God.

0:15:29.760,0:15:32.580
It cannot be imitated.

0:15:32.580,0:15:35.800
But today, what is happening?

0:15:35.800,0:15:40.240
You see everybody doing the same.

0:15:40.240,0:15:45.860
Sometimes, God deals with people in different ways.

0:15:45.860,0:16:00.380
God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.

0:16:00.380,0:16:04.960
This is why it is a bit dangerous when you pick a textbook

0:16:04.960,0:16:07.960
and you read how to pray.

0:16:07.960,0:16:11.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:11.320,0:16:14.480
The Holy Spirit helps us in our prayer.

0:16:14.480,0:16:18.580
When you take a textbook and begin to read how to pray -

0:16:18.580,0:16:24.740
"pray for deliverance", "pray for this", "pray for that" - no.

0:16:24.740,0:16:35.500
God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.

0:16:35.500,0:16:39.500
Tell your neighbour, "God will not meet you

0:16:39.500,0:16:45.540
because you imitate what someone else did".

0:16:45.540,0:16:50.400
That is, someone else prays, "In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name!"

0:16:50.400,0:16:54.020
After watching the way the person prays, you also get there and say,

0:16:54.020,0:16:56.460
"In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name!"

0:16:56.460,0:17:00.560
Remember, this one is being inspired to do so.

0:17:00.560,0:17:02.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:02.620,0:17:08.380
You are not inspired to do so, you are only copying, you are only imitating.

0:17:08.380,0:17:10.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:10.740,0:17:14.060
Some of you will pick up a textbook and begin to read

0:17:14.060,0:17:16.700
"7 points of ways to pray".

0:17:16.700,0:17:20.560
You want to fast for 3 days because you read somewhere to do so.

0:17:20.560,0:17:22.940
The person has been inspired to do so.

0:17:22.940,0:17:24.780
Not you!

God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.

0:17:36.600,0:17:49.240
God will meet you when you obey what He told you to do by the Spirit,

0:17:49.240,0:17:52.980
based on His Word.

0:17:52.980,0:18:00.220
When you take action in obedience to God, you will prosper.

0:18:00.220,0:18:06.800
When you take action in obedience to God, you will get it.

0:18:06.800,0:18:09.660
You will prosper.

0:18:09.660,0:18:20.520
Tell your neighbour, "God will not meet you, because you imitate what someone else did".

0:18:20.520,0:18:24.480
Like prayer, like fasting.

0:18:24.480,0:18:27.300
You say, "Somebody asked me to fast",

0:18:27.300,0:18:31.340
"This is the standard", "This is the traditional way", "This is the song to sing ",

0:18:31.340,0:18:34.040
"This is how to sing it out, this is how to sing it in",

0:18:34.040,0:18:36.300
"This is this, this is that",

0:18:36.300,0:18:37.740
"This is what they asked us to do",

0:18:37.740,0:18:40.060
"This is this" - this is a lot.

0:18:40.060,0:18:42.800

God will meet you when you obey what He Himself told you to do

0:18:53.660,0:19:01.820
and He can only say it by His Spirit, based on His Word.

0:19:01.820,0:19:09.780
That is, taking action in obedience to God.

Three, faith is not an issue of ordering God around.

0:19:20.140,0:19:25.680
You know today, our prayer is to instruct God.

0:19:25.680,0:19:30.520
We always instruct God, "I need this. In the name of Jesus give me, give me, give me, give me!"

0:19:30.520,0:19:34.320
You don't mind whether it is His will to give you.

0:19:34.320,0:19:38.020
You don't even bother to know God's will before you ask.

0:19:38.020,0:19:42.100
And if you ask according to His will, He gives.

0:19:42.100,0:19:44.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:44.660,0:19:49.380
Faith is not an issue of ordering God around.

0:19:49.380,0:19:53.140
When we pray, we instruct God what to do, what to give us

0:19:53.140,0:19:59.840
and when that is not given, we feel bad! It affects our faith.

0:19:59.840,0:20:07.480
Who knows what would have happened to you,

0:20:07.480,0:20:13.320
if your prayer for a better life had been answered?

0:20:13.320,0:20:20.060
A better life to buy the best car.

0:20:20.060,0:20:23.200
A better life to build a beautiful house.

0:20:23.200,0:20:27.100
A better life to become a governor, a minister, a senator.

0:20:27.100,0:20:32.320
Who knows what would have happened?

0:20:32.320,0:20:39.260
We are talking about those things that are not Biblical faith.

0:20:39.260,0:20:42.500
And we practice it; we say it is faith.

0:20:42.500,0:20:47.640
Many things you do, like many testimonies today,

0:20:47.640,0:20:57.420
people came out to say, "Yes, I ministered my Morning Water 4 times, saying 'Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!'".

0:20:57.420,0:21:00.840
You quickly write it down.

0:21:00.840,0:21:02.000
Why are you writing it down?

0:21:02.000,0:21:08.520
When you get your own, you now say "Oh, that man ministered it 3 times, saying 'Jesus, Jesus'".

0:21:08.520,0:21:14.300
You will now do your own too: "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!!!"

0:21:14.300,0:21:15.640
Nothing happens.

0:21:15.640,0:21:20.680
The man that is talking may be inspired by the Holy Spirit to do so.

0:21:20.680,0:21:22.620
But you are not inspired.

0:21:22.620,0:21:24.600
You are only imitating this man.

0:21:24.600,0:21:26.600
You are an "imitator".

0:21:26.600,0:21:28.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:28.820,0:21:32.120
Like many of us have books we read - "prayer",

0:21:32.120,0:21:38.460
"prayer for deliverance: turn this way, 'Jesus! Jesus!' Turn to the other side, 'Jesus, Jesus!'

0:21:38.460,0:21:40.020
Another side, 'Jesus! Jesus!'"

0:21:40.020,0:21:44.040
It get's frustrating when you do that and the prayer is not answered.

0:21:44.040,0:21:46.360
But you are imitating.

0:21:46.360,0:21:48.480
The man, somebody, wrote it.

0:21:48.480,0:21:53.380
The person has been inspired to do so - but not you!

0:21:53.380,0:22:03.400
You will not meet Jesus because you imitate what someone else did.

0:22:03.400,0:22:07.400
What someone else did is what you are reading.

0:22:07.400,0:22:14.200
Unless you receive from God in yourself...

0:22:14.200,0:22:23.120
You will meet God when you obey what God told you directly.

0:22:23.120,0:22:25.640
May God bless His Word.
