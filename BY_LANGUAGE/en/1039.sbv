Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.560,0:00:06.480
I love you so much.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests

0:00:09.760,0:00:14.640
If not because of time, I would have given you a handshake and a kiss.

0:00:14.640,0:00:18.600
Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests

0:00:18.600,0:00:28.840
I can do that by faith. Are you ready to receive it by faith?

0:00:28.840,0:00:30.840
Thank you.

0:00:30.840,0:00:33.400
I want to appreciate your coming here today.

0:00:33.400,0:00:38.760
Thank you very much for coming.

0:00:38.760,0:00:40.760
Hallelujah!

0:00:40.760,0:00:42.400
Thank you.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests

0:00:46.240,0:00:58.180
I am here to let you know that I want to renew my relationship and my friendship with you.

0:00:58.180,0:01:06.280
Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests

0:01:06.280,0:01:14.460
I mean, I want to improve in my relationship with you.

0:01:14.460,0:01:17.240
You are my best friends.

0:01:17.240,0:01:27.620
I want you to know that everything you have as a Christian came from God

0:01:27.620,0:01:36.000
and everything you will receive in the future will come from God.

0:01:36.000,0:01:47.000
If that is the case, giving is the beginning of blessing.

0:01:47.000,0:01:51.380
So, when I give you, I am giving to myself.

0:01:51.380,0:02:01.420
When I am giving you, don't say, "Thank you", because I am reshaping my own destiny.

0:02:01.420,0:02:05.160
It's like you are helping me.

0:02:05.160,0:02:11.920
If I am giving you and you receive it, you are the one helping me.

0:02:11.920,0:02:20.140
I don't know why you love me.

0:02:20.140,0:02:24.840
When I give you and you receive it, you are helping me.

0:02:24.840,0:02:28.420
I don't know why you love me.

0:02:28.420,0:02:37.120
You left your houses all the way from different states and came here.

0:02:37.120,0:02:47.420
It is more blessed to give than to receive.

0:02:47.420,0:02:51.700
Love and be loved.

0:02:51.700,0:02:55.600
Be kind and receive kindness.

0:02:55.600,0:02:59.460
Show mercy and receive mercy.

0:02:59.460,0:03:05.120
Thank you.

0:03:05.120,0:03:13.720
We are going to give each of you two bags of rice.

0:03:13.720,0:03:22.280
And we are giving each person N5,000.

0:03:22.280,0:03:34.620
The grand total is twenty million, three hundred and some thousands.

0:03:34.620,0:03:38.220
We will pay for your transport.

0:03:38.220,0:03:43.700
The 5,000 naira is your own money. Transport - we are going to pay it.

0:03:43.700,0:03:51.320
We have discussed it with the driver who brought you.

0:03:51.320,0:04:00.000
Next meeting, I will spoil you.

0:04:00.000,0:04:04.880
These are wheelchairs for you.

0:04:04.880,0:04:08.580
Thank you very much.

0:04:08.580,0:04:10.400
I want to sing for you.

0:04:10.400,0:04:12.400
Do you want to sing for me? Ok, sing for me.

0:04:12.400,0:04:20.880
T.B. Joshua, we love you forever

0:04:20.880,0:04:22.880
Amen! In the place of T.B. Joshua -

0:04:22.880,0:04:35.140
Jesus Christ, we love You forever

0:04:35.140,0:04:37.800
Clap for her!

0:04:37.800,0:04:39.120
Ok, sing.

0:04:39.120,0:04:41.920
We have a father

0:04:41.920,0:04:46.760
A very very handsome father

0:04:46.760,0:04:57.860
Oh how he loves us

0:04:57.860,0:05:03.700
We now know why we always smile

0:05:03.700,0:05:06.920
Oh how he loves us

0:05:06.920,0:05:08.320
Thank you.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests

0:05:48.280,0:05:49.420
Thank you.

0:05:49.420,0:05:51.040
Hallelujah!

0:05:51.040,0:05:54.720
After spending quality time with the physically challenged,

0:05:54.720,0:06:00.740
who have come to The SCOAN

0:06:00.740,0:06:05.020
it is time for the gifts to be distributed into their midst.

0:06:05.020,0:06:13.120
You can see the large array of wheelchairs, kindly provided by Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide

0:06:13.120,0:06:17.880
which will shortly be given out to people in dire need.

0:06:17.880,0:06:25.360
In addition to the wheelchairs, each and every physically challenged guest to The SCOAN

0:06:25.360,0:06:32.160
will be leaving with two bags of rice and the sum of 5,000 naira,

0:06:32.160,0:06:40.140
aside from their various transporation costs from their respective states and countries.

0:06:40.140,0:06:46.000
Here is the huge mountain of rice that will soon be freely given

0:06:46.000,0:06:49.480
to those present at this wonderful gathering.

0:06:49.480,0:06:57.200
Remember, God has no hands but our hands to reach out to a troubled world

0:06:57.200,0:07:02.520
with His love, compassion and generosity.

0:07:02.520,0:07:11.960
This lady painfully walks forward, assisted only by a stick despite her extreme physical disability.

0:07:11.960,0:07:16.920
She is assisted to sit in her brand-new wheelchair.

0:07:16.920,0:07:21.240
You can only imagine how much of relief this will be for her

0:07:21.240,0:07:26.900
and how much easier and less stressful her daily movement will now be,

0:07:26.900,0:07:31.240
especially since she is carrying a young baby.

0:07:31.240,0:07:47.380
Physically Challenged Guests Assisted Into Their New Wheelchairs

0:07:47.380,0:07:55.960
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:07:55.960,0:08:05.480
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:08:05.480,0:08:14.060
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:08:14.060,0:08:26.440
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:08:26.440,0:08:44.280
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:08:44.280,0:08:50.260
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:08:50.260,0:08:55.420
Those with extremely inhibiting physical challenges make their way forward

0:08:55.420,0:09:01.140
to receive their brand-new wheelchairs, courtesy of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:09:01.140,0:09:05.040
and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.

0:09:05.040,0:09:13.220
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:09:13.220,0:09:18.940
Consider the stress and the hardship they must face on a daily basis,

0:09:18.940,0:09:25.040
just trying to move around the busy streets of Lagos or whichever state they are coming from.

0:09:25.040,0:09:30.180
These are just a few out of the thousands of physically challenged people

0:09:30.180,0:09:37.800
who have been blessed with wheelchairs, food items and cash gifts since the start of The SCOAN.

0:09:37.800,0:09:46.020
As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Whatever we receive from the ministry, must go back into the ministry of giving

0:09:46.020,0:09:53.440
to raise the standards of people's living, to give hope to the hopeless and help to the helpless.

0:09:53.440,0:10:00.120
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:10:00.120,0:10:12.520
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:10:12.520,0:10:30.380
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:10:30.380,0:10:38.940
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:10:38.940,0:10:47.700
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:10:47.700,0:10:56.960
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:10:56.960,0:11:09.360
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:11:09.360,0:11:35.280
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:11:35.280,0:11:40.560
Those given wheelchairs on this particular occasion wave their hands in gratitude

0:11:40.560,0:11:46.160
and appreciation to God as the charitable activities continue.

0:11:46.160,0:11:52.720
As you see the conditions of those coming forward to receive this life-changing gift,

0:11:52.720,0:11:58.240
let this be an encouragement and also a challenge to you.

0:11:58.240,0:12:04.420
There are many people with similar situations in your own community, in your own environment.

0:12:04.420,0:12:11.660
Looking the other way when you see them in trouble is equal to rejecting Christ Himself.

0:12:11.660,0:12:16.860
It is now time for the distribution of the rice and cash gifts.

0:12:16.860,0:12:22.800
The first set of people given are those who have just received their brand-new wheelchairs.

0:12:22.800,0:12:27.460
...more of whatever we give

0:12:27.460,0:12:32.520
When we give, we are planting...

0:12:32.520,0:12:40.060
As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "The value of money is not to store up properties or possessions.

0:12:40.060,0:12:46.540
The value of money is to change lives, change nations and change the world".

0:12:46.540,0:12:51.000
Many of these people came in hopeless and desperate situations.

0:12:51.000,0:12:55.380
But they are leaving with a renewed sense of hope and purpose in life,

0:12:55.380,0:12:59.720
knowing that God has not forsaken or forgotten them.

0:12:59.720,0:13:05.740
What can you do with what God has given to you to reach out to them?

0:13:05.740,0:13:10.880
One thing is clear: No one is created without a gift.

0:13:10.880,0:13:14.820
And each gift is meant to meet a need.

0:13:14.820,0:13:16.820
Find them.

0:13:16.820,0:13:19.780
...relationship

0:13:19.780,0:13:29.360
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:13:29.360,0:13:38.020
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:13:38.020,0:13:50.360
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:13:50.360,0:14:08.420
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:14:08.420,0:14:16.760
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:14:16.760,0:14:25.600
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:14:25.600,0:14:34.860
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:14:34.860,0:14:47.420
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:14:47.420,0:15:53.960
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:15:53.960,0:16:01.220
After receiving their gifts, the Emmanuel TV Team proceeds to assist them to leave the venue.

0:16:01.220,0:16:08.440
Every single physically challenged person who came to The SCOAN on this glorious occasion

0:16:08.440,0:16:14.280
left with a wonderful blessing and the knowledge that their physical disability

0:16:14.280,0:16:17.920
did not stop them from being a friend of God.

0:16:17.920,0:16:24.620
Their pockets were replenished, their hearts enlightened and their hopes revitalised.

0:16:24.620,0:16:29.300
As they leave with smiles and joy, radiating in their countenance,

0:16:29.300,0:16:35.300
the Emmanuel TV Team followed them carrying their two bags of rice.

0:16:35.300,0:16:42.640
Remember, as a Christian, your life is a solution to someone in trouble.

0:16:42.640,0:16:46.560
You should build your Christian life around this principle,

0:16:46.560,0:16:51.140
knowing that we serve God when we help our fellow brothers.

0:16:51.140,0:16:57.540
Our position in Christ Jesus is enhanced each time we help someone in trouble.

0:16:57.540,0:17:04.940
This is what our Lord Jesus Christ meant when He said in Matthew 25, from verse 40 to 45,

0:17:04.940,0:17:13.640
"Whatsoever you do or you fail to do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me".

0:17:13.640,0:17:20.320
In other words, Jesus was saying here, "I have no farm where I expect you to work for me.

0:17:20.320,0:17:24.620
Or an office where I expect you to help me in checking files.

0:17:24.620,0:17:29.500
My farm and my office are your fellow brothers.

0:17:29.500,0:17:36.780
Whatever problem you help them to solve, that you do unto me".

0:17:36.780,0:17:45.380
...mutual faith, mutual love

0:17:45.380,0:17:54.040
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:17:54.040,0:18:02.720
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:18:02.720,0:18:11.960
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:18:11.960,0:18:24.560
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:18:24.560,0:18:29.160
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus...

0:18:29.160,0:18:32.080
My name is Miss Patricia Malcolm from Kwara State (Nigeria).

0:18:32.080,0:18:36.020
We are here because the man of God invited us again.

0:18:36.020,0:18:39.540
He showered us with a lot of love.

0:18:39.540,0:18:43.840
He showed us love - the love of Christ, he is expressing it to us once again.

0:18:43.840,0:18:48.000
I pray that God will continue to bless him and love him too, the way he loves us.

0:18:48.000,0:18:51.220
I am so happy today because the hospitality was so great.

0:18:51.220,0:18:54.980
We were treated well by the man of God

0:18:54.980,0:18:56.980
We have been shown love.

0:18:56.980,0:19:00.180
By giving us food and drink, we are so happy.

0:19:00.180,0:19:02.680
You can see everybody around us here; we are happy.

0:19:02.680,0:19:06.300
We are going home with two bags of rice and money in our pockets.

0:19:06.300,0:19:07.160
Thank you.

0:19:07.160,0:19:09.520
Amen. Love looks around to see those who are in need

0:19:09.520,0:19:13.800
and we thank God that you who are in need are very appreciative of the wonderful gift of God

0:19:13.800,0:19:17.300
in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners. God bless you.

0:19:17.300,0:19:23.300
...as the reason for relationship.

0:19:23.300,0:19:31.960
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:19:31.960,0:19:41.760
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:19:41.760,0:19:46.860
I am Nneka Benedicta from Anambra State (Nigeria).

0:19:46.860,0:19:52.760
Pastor T.B. Joshua, we thank you. God bless him for all he has done today.

0:19:52.760,0:19:57.320
We wish him all the best with God's love and protection.

0:19:57.320,0:20:00.200
Amen. Is this your first time at this programme?

0:20:00.200,0:20:00.880
Yes.

0:20:00.880,0:20:02.720
What did you receive today?

0:20:02.720,0:20:05.940
God's love, so many things.

0:20:05.940,0:20:09.980
As you can see, we have two bags of rice and the money he gave us.

0:20:09.980,0:20:12.500
May God guide and protect him, bless him the more.

0:20:12.500,0:20:13.380
Thank you.

0:20:13.380,0:20:21.220
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:20:21.220,0:20:24.840
Today you are here at the meeting of the physically challenged with Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:20:24.840,0:20:28.020
and you received two bags of rice and 5,000 naira. How do you feel?

0:20:28.020,0:20:30.440
I am very happy!

0:20:30.440,0:20:33.160
I thank him very much.

0:20:33.160,0:20:36.480
May God bless him.

0:20:36.480,0:20:41.020
I pray for more blessings for him. God should bless him more.

0:20:41.020,0:20:44.760
God bless you, sir. We pray that you have a safe trip back home.

0:20:44.760,0:20:45.800
Thank you

0:20:45.800,0:20:49.940
Thank you very much. God bless you.

0:20:49.940,0:20:55.720
...more of whatever we give

0:20:55.720,0:20:57.940
When we give...

0:20:57.940,0:21:00.760
Peace be unto you!

0:21:00.760,0:21:06.060
We are thanking T.B. Joshua for the gifts and for what he has done for us.

0:21:06.060,0:21:08.060
May God bless him.

0:21:08.060,0:21:12.940
Everyone of us who are physically challenged have been blessed with a gift from him.

0:21:12.940,0:21:17.140
May God bless him more and more - a hundredfold.

0:21:17.140,0:21:18.920
Thank you.

0:21:18.920,0:21:24.360
...multiplied back to us

0:21:24.360,0:21:27.320
Every true friendship...

0:21:27.320,0:21:29.500
Hello, sir. How are you?

0:21:29.500,0:21:32.180
Fine. Thank you. God bless you.

0:21:32.180,0:21:33.620
Thank you. I appreciate it.

0:21:33.620,0:21:37.640
I pray that God will provide everything he needs.

0:21:37.640,0:21:38.520
Thank you.

0:21:38.520,0:21:54.380

Oluwole from Ekiti (Nigeria).

0:21:56.980,0:22:01.180
So you came all the way from Ekiti State to this special meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:22:01.180,0:22:04.400
We really enjoyed the meeting with Pastor T.B. Joshua.

0:22:04.400,0:22:08.600
We are very excited about the gifts from Pastor T.B. Joshua.

0:22:08.600,0:22:10.500
What did you receive? What are you going home with?

0:22:10.500,0:22:13.140
Two bags of rice and 5,000 naira each.

0:22:13.140,0:22:16.380
Have a safe journey back home. Thank you very much for coming. Bye bye.

0:22:16.380,0:22:18.000
Please tell us your name.

0:22:18.000,0:22:19.160
I'm Pauline.

0:22:19.160,0:22:20.620
And where did you come from?

0:22:20.620,0:22:22.280
I'm coming from Abia State (Nigeria).

0:22:22.280,0:22:26.700
In fact, I can't really express myself.

0:22:26.700,0:22:32.320
I really didn't expect this. Seriously, I'm very grateful.

0:22:32.320,0:22:37.500
I pray and ask God to add more grease to his elbows.

0:22:37.500,0:22:39.340
Amen. Is this your first time?

0:22:39.340,0:22:40.720
It is my first time.

0:22:40.720,0:22:44.320
Tell us - what did you receive today?

0:22:44.320,0:22:49.700
I received a big token of 5,000 naira and two bags of rice.

0:22:49.700,0:22:50.900
And you are glad about that?

0:22:50.900,0:22:52.480
I am very glad.

0:22:52.480,0:22:55.760
Those who have been criticising the man of God,

0:22:55.760,0:22:59.340
I really don't see the reason why they should do that.

0:22:59.340,0:23:02.560
I think that the person who God has blessed, God has blessed that person

0:23:02.560,0:23:06.580
and the person who God has given a gift, He has given him that gift.

0:23:06.580,0:23:11.040
I am telling people of the world that they shouldn't criticise a man of God;

0:23:11.040,0:23:14.940
he is a very good man. God is really using him.

0:23:14.940,0:23:18.440
I am very grateful and very happy for today.

0:23:18.440,0:23:21.600
Thank you very much. And we wish you a safe journey back home

0:23:21.600,0:23:23.920
and hope to see you next time at this meeting, in Jesus' name.

0:23:23.920,0:23:26.820
Amen. Thank you.

The Physically Challenged Guests Are Assisted With Their Gifts Of Rice

0:23:39.780,0:23:48.300
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:23:48.300,0:23:57.740
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:23:57.740,0:24:06.340
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:24:06.340,0:24:18.740
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:24:18.740,0:24:36.680
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:24:36.680,0:24:45.220
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:24:45.220,0:24:53.960
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:24:53.960,0:25:03.180
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:25:03.180,0:25:06.200
When we give, we are planting...

My name is Kate Ajudua. I'm from Delta State (Nigeria).

0:25:09.580,0:25:12.940
How was the meeting for you today with Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:25:12.940,0:25:16.920
He invited you all the way from your state to this special occasion. How do you feel?

0:25:16.920,0:25:19.700
I feel good. I want to thank the man of God.

0:25:19.700,0:25:24.180
I know that God is helping him to help those who need help.

0:25:24.180,0:25:29.900
I know that God is going to replenish his pockets.

0:25:29.900,0:25:33.060
I thank God for his life, family and ministry.

0:25:33.060,0:25:38.500
I ask God to expand his ministry and bless him the more.

0:25:38.500,0:25:39.340
Thank you.

0:25:39.340,0:25:42.600
Amen. How is this Christmas going to be different for you?

0:25:42.600,0:25:47.860

0:25:47.860,0:25:51.720
Amen. We thank God for your life. Be blessed as you go home, in Jesus' name.

Kehinde. I come from Kehiti (Nigeria).

0:25:57.420,0:26:03.860
Are you one of those who attended the physically challenged meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua today?

0:26:03.860,0:26:06.220
Yes. I am very happy.

0:26:06.220,0:26:07.680
Is this your first time?

0:26:07.680,0:26:10.720
No, this is not my first time. This is my second time of coming here.

0:26:10.720,0:26:13.260
Tell us - what was the gift you received today?

0:26:13.260,0:26:16.120
I received two bags of rice and 5,000 naira.

0:26:16.120,0:26:17.640
And you are happy about that?

0:26:17.640,0:26:19.100
yes,God bless T.B. Joshua.

0:26:19.100,0:26:20.780

0:26:20.780,0:26:24.800
We are very grateful for the man of God and his intervention.

0:26:24.800,0:26:26.000
We are very grateful.

0:26:26.000,0:26:27.400
Is this your first time?

0:26:27.400,0:26:28.960
Of course, this is my first time.

0:26:28.960,0:26:31.520
Ok, tell us - what was the gift you received today?

0:26:31.520,0:26:35.820
I received two bags of rice. You can see it here. And the sum of 5,000 naira.

0:26:35.820,0:26:42.100
People should know that the man of God is friendly to us and we are grateful for that.

0:26:42.100,0:26:48.360
Other men of God should know how to offer this kind of help.

0:26:48.360,0:26:50.880
Thank you very much. We wish you a safe journey back home.

0:26:50.880,0:26:52.580
Thank you very much.

0:26:52.580,0:26:55.540
...relationship as well

0:26:55.540,0:27:04.220
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:27:04.220,0:27:16.620
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:27:16.620,0:27:34.400
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:27:34.400,0:27:40.080
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:27:40.080,0:27:43.100
Emmanuel! You are welcome. What is your name? Where are you from?

0:27:43.100,0:27:45.820

0:27:45.820,0:27:48.360
And you are here today for the special meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:27:48.360,0:27:50.360
What can you say about what took place today?

0:27:50.360,0:27:53.800
What a wonderful day. I am very happy to see today

0:27:53.800,0:27:59.140
because T.B. Joshua, the man of God, has done well for us.

0:27:59.140,0:28:00.600
More grease to his elbows.

0:28:00.600,0:28:02.480
Wonderful. Sir, what did you receive today?

0:28:02.480,0:28:04.000
I received a blessing.

0:28:04.000,0:28:07.680
What was done for me, I am very happy with it - 5,000 naira and two bags of rice.

0:28:07.680,0:28:08.500
Thank you very much.

0:28:08.500,0:28:11.200
- Safe journey back home, sir.
- Thank you.

0:28:11.200,0:28:14.700
...multiplied back to us

0:28:14.700,0:28:17.340
Hi. Tell us your name and where you are from.

0:28:17.340,0:28:20.180
My name is Chiwenda from Imo State (Nigeria).

0:28:20.180,0:28:24.860
And today you are here at the physically challenged meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:28:24.860,0:28:26.160
What did you receive today?

0:28:26.160,0:28:29.960
I received two bags of rice and 5,000 naira.

0:28:29.960,0:28:31.060
And are you happy?

0:28:31.060,0:28:32.580
Yes, I am happy. Thank you very much.

0:28:32.580,0:28:34.320
Tell us your name and where you come from.

0:28:34.320,0:28:37.140
I am Kolawole from Osun (Nigeria).

0:28:37.140,0:28:38.260
This has been wonderful.

0:28:38.260,0:28:42.980
He has been doing it - for the past five years, I have been witnessing it.

0:28:42.980,0:28:45.940
But today's own was great!

0:28:45.940,0:28:49.140
When I saw the number of people,

0:28:49.140,0:28:57.000
I said to myself, "What people would take away today would be 1,000 naira and a bag of rice".

0:28:57.000,0:29:01.480
When the man of God said he was going to give each person 5,000, I said, "Wow! This is great!"

0:29:01.480,0:29:06.280
With this number of people, giving them 5,000 naira each and two bags of rice,

0:29:06.280,0:29:08.760
if you don't see it by yourself, you may not believe it.

0:29:08.760,0:29:11.640
But seeing is believing. I believe people are watching this at home.

0:29:11.640,0:29:13.280
They will see what is going on here.

0:29:13.280,0:29:17.440
I don't think anybody can judge anybody except on what you see.

0:29:17.440,0:29:18.920
So, we have seen a good thing today.

0:29:18.920,0:29:21.580
Thank you very much. We wish you a safe journey back home.

0:29:21.580,0:29:34.540
...mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:29:34.540,0:29:43.080
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:29:43.080,0:29:51.900
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:29:51.900,0:30:01.060
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:30:01.060,0:30:08.820
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied...

0:30:08.820,0:30:11.600

I'm going home with two bags of rice and 5,000 naira. Wow!

0:30:20.540,0:30:22.020
It is what we live for.

0:30:22.020,0:30:24.260
Glory be to God. We thank God.

0:30:24.260,0:30:27.120
It is very awesome. Yes, it is awesome.

0:30:27.120,0:30:29.340
Awesome. God bless you. Safe journey home.

0:30:29.340,0:30:31.100

I am feeling fine.

0:30:45.720,0:30:47.720
Have a safe journey back to your state.

0:30:47.720,0:30:48.900
Thank you very much.

0:30:48.900,0:30:56.520

Chidinma from Imo State (Nigeria)

0:30:59.240,0:31:02.420
Today you have spent this wonderful occasion with us

0:31:02.420,0:31:05.660
as you were invited by the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua to this special occasion.

0:31:05.660,0:31:11.020
Today you received 5,000 naira and two bags of rice and also a brand-new wheelchair.

0:31:11.020,0:31:12.340
How do you feel?

0:31:12.340,0:31:15.600
Very fine and good. I am so happy for that.

0:31:15.600,0:31:19.000
I am grateful to the man of God.

0:31:19.000,0:31:22.040
We thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners

0:31:22.040,0:31:24.320
who made this day special for you.

0:31:24.320,0:31:28.380
We pray that God Almighty who has provided all these gifts for you

0:31:28.380,0:31:30.120
will continue to supply, in Jesus name.

0:31:30.120,0:31:30.840
Amen.

0:31:30.840,0:31:31.820
Safe journey home.

0:31:31.820,0:31:32.700
Thank you very much.

0:31:32.700,0:31:35.440
My name is Busola Abidogun.

0:31:35.440,0:31:36.520
And you come from where?

0:31:36.520,0:31:37.700
Akure (Nigeria).

0:31:37.700,0:31:39.280
This is not my first time.

0:31:39.280,0:31:40.560
So you have been here before?

0:31:40.560,0:31:41.380
Yes.

0:31:41.380,0:31:44.380
In the meeting today, what did you receive?

0:31:44.380,0:31:47.440
A lot - money, rice and a wheelchair.

0:31:47.440,0:31:51.120
I really thank him. May the Lord God Almighty be with him and guide him.

0:31:51.120,0:31:55.180
People should emulate what Prophet T.B. Joshua is doing.

0:31:55.180,0:31:57.920
We wish you a safe journey back home, in Jesus' name.

0:31:57.920,0:31:59.660
Amen.

0:31:59.660,0:32:01.320
Emmanuel! Indeed, God is with us.

0:32:01.320,0:32:03.720
Here we have physically challenged people.

0:32:03.720,0:32:07.020
To the glory of God, they had their meeting here with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:32:07.020,0:32:11.180
And they were blessed tremendously through the kind gesture of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:32:11.180,0:32:13.340
and now they are embarking on their journey back home.

0:32:13.340,0:32:16.220
So here we have the bus that conveyed people from Ekiti State

0:32:16.220,0:32:20.800
to The SCOAN for the physically challenged meeting that just concluded some hours ago.

0:32:20.800,0:32:25.420
So right now, based on the philanthropic nature and kind gesture of the man of God,

0:32:25.420,0:32:30.140
he said we should give the money they used in transporting themselves

0:32:30.140,0:32:32.940
from their various destinations to The SCOAN.

0:32:32.940,0:32:35.500
The cost is 15,000 naira - this is it.

0:32:35.500,0:32:38.440
Now, the prophet loves you for being patient enough

0:32:38.440,0:32:41.440
to convey them from Lagos to The SCOAN.

0:32:41.440,0:32:47.140
For that reason, he said we should give you this cash gift and two bags of rice.

0:32:47.140,0:32:49.540
Now, to our coordinator.

0:32:49.540,0:32:52.460
The prophet loves you and your colleagues who are the physically challenged.

0:32:52.460,0:32:54.860
The prophet said we should give you 80,000 naira

0:32:54.860,0:32:57.980
which is the cost of your transportation from Lagos back to Ekiti State.

0:32:57.980,0:33:00.760
The cost is 80,000 naira which the prophet said we should give you.

0:33:00.760,0:33:03.300
Thank you very much. We really appreciate what Pastor T.B. Joshua did for us.

0:33:03.300,0:33:05.800
The cost is 80,000 naira which the prophet said we should give you.

0:33:05.800,0:33:10.380
I thank him very much. May God give him long life and prosperity.

0:33:10.380,0:33:13.380
For doing this, God will bless him very well.

0:33:13.380,0:33:14.980
God will bless him so much.

0:33:14.980,0:33:17.140
We are from Ekiti State.

0:33:17.140,0:33:20.480
We really appreciate what the man of God did for us. The man is a great hero.

0:33:20.480,0:33:21.780
Thank you.

0:33:21.780,0:33:28.920
...we receive more of whatever we give

0:33:28.920,0:33:38.480
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied...

0:33:38.480,0:33:41.580
Emmanuel!

0:33:41.580,0:33:46.440
The Physically Challenged Guests Are Transported Back To Their Various Homes With Their Gifts

0:33:46.440,0:33:50.320
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:33:50.320,0:33:55.680
When we give, we are planting seeds...

0:33:55.680,0:33:58.860
The physically challenged are the friends of Jesus

0:33:58.860,0:34:03.020
and also the friends of Prophet T.B. Joshua and his ministry. That is why we are here.

0:34:03.020,0:34:06.000
Austin Chima from Imo State (Nigeria).

0:34:06.000,0:34:10.800
We are happy to be here because last year, we couldn't make it.

0:34:10.800,0:34:15.520
We are here to receive what our fellow physcially disabled colleagues

0:34:15.520,0:34:17.660
have enjoyed in the past.

0:34:17.660,0:34:23.120
We were here today to receive our own and we are happy that we received our own.

0:34:23.120,0:34:29.360
We want to use this opportunity to thank our Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:34:29.360,0:34:32.480
for this kind gesture that he has done today.

0:34:32.480,0:34:38.920

And this group comes from Abia State.

0:35:12.140,0:35:16.060
By the grace of God, we are here to represent Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:35:16.060,0:35:22.640
to give this cash gift of 90,000 naira for the physcially challenged that came from Abia State.

0:35:28.100,0:35:31.540
I'm one of Nigeria's goal keepers.

0:35:31.540,0:35:36.260
We came from Abia State to celebrate with Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:35:36.260,0:35:39.100
I'm one of the physically challenged.

0:35:39.100,0:35:42.940
We are very grateful that the man of God was able to do this for us.

0:35:42.940,0:35:46.340
I don't really know what to say because it is unbelievable.

0:35:46.340,0:35:51.820
I believe that God should bless him more and more, in Jesus' name.

0:35:51.820,0:35:54.900
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, said that we should all say,

0:35:54.900,0:35:58.000
"Thank you for receiving the gift". God bless you.

0:35:58.000,0:35:59.500
I have a word for the man of God.

0:35:59.500,0:36:01.820
I am thanking him for what he has done for us.

0:36:01.820,0:36:04.280
We are waiting for him to answer us in our world cup,

0:36:04.280,0:36:09.240
October next year in Mexico that he will sponsor us.

0:36:09.240,0:36:15.940
He has done it before; he will do it again.

0:36:15.940,0:36:16.800
How are you, sir?

0:36:16.800,0:36:17.700
Fine, sir.

0:36:17.700,0:36:19.840
Did you enjoy your coming to The SCOAN?

0:36:19.840,0:36:24.880
Yes, I enjoyed today. I thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:36:24.880,0:36:26.860
As he has done this for us, God will bless him.

0:36:26.860,0:36:30.400
People of God, the man of God said we should pay your transportation

0:36:30.400,0:36:37.360
and that money is what we are giving to him now - 15,000 naira.

0:36:37.360,0:36:39.360
God bess you.

0:36:39.360,0:36:43.580
Also here with me, sir: The man of God said we should bless you with Christmas gift.

0:36:43.580,0:36:46.480
And this is 5,000 naira.

0:36:46.480,0:36:48.360
Thank you, sir.

0:36:48.360,0:36:53.100
And also two bags of rice.

0:36:53.100,0:36:56.220
I thank God! More promotion!

0:36:56.220,0:37:00.240
My prophet, long life and prosperity!

0:37:00.240,0:37:07.960
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied...

0:37:07.960,0:37:11.080
After bringing your group here, the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua said

0:37:11.080,0:37:16.900
we should give to you as a driver the sum of 5,000 naira. This is for you, sir.

0:37:16.900,0:37:19.040
And two bags of rice as well.

0:37:19.040,0:37:26.660
Because we know of your effort in bringing these guys all the way to Lagos from Ebonyi.

0:37:26.660,0:37:30.660
We also have this sum for the people in the vehicle

0:37:30.660,0:37:36.340
which is transportation for them to get all the way back to Ebonyi in a safe and sound fashion.

0:37:36.340,0:37:39.440
So, this is for you - 30,000 naira.

0:37:39.440,0:37:43.260
Thank you. He has been doing it. This is not the first time I have been hearing about it.

0:37:43.260,0:37:45.160
More grease to his elbows.

0:37:45.160,0:37:50.140
I want to say thank you to the man of God who has given us this opportunity

0:37:50.140,0:37:51.640
to receive from him.

0:37:51.640,0:37:56.780
...multiplied back to us

0:37:56.780,0:38:09.920
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:38:09.920,0:38:13.940
Sir, you are welcome here today to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.

0:38:13.940,0:38:16.760

0:38:16.760,0:38:21.080

0:38:21.080,0:38:24.320

0:38:24.320,0:38:28.420

0:39:35.440,0:39:40.220
...mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:39:40.220,0:39:41.440
Thank you so much for coming.

0:39:41.440,0:39:44.720
You can see that this group of people have come and been with us

0:39:44.720,0:39:48.180
for the physically challenged meeting as they were invited by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:39:48.180,0:39:53.020
We want to present you here a gift of 180,000 naira

0:39:53.020,0:39:57.060
which is the transportation for everyone here in the bus.

0:39:57.060,0:39:59.500
So, driver, this is their transport money.

0:39:59.500,0:40:01.320
So you don't need to collect anything from them.

0:40:01.320,0:40:03.460
This is for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:40:03.460,0:40:10.320
We also want to give you 15,000 naira for fuel to drop them to their various destinations from there.

0:40:36.960,0:40:39.860

...mutual love

0:40:47.380,0:40:51.540
...mutual trust, mutual faith

0:40:51.540,0:40:55.860
We have just finished the wonderful physically challenged meeting with T.B. Joshua

0:40:55.860,0:41:00.980
and our friends are about to leave on their way back to their states, on their way back home.

0:41:00.980,0:41:07.400
We just want to tell you all that the man of God has paid for your transport

0:41:07.400,0:41:12.120

Cash Gifts, Transport Money And Rice Were Given To All The Drivers Who Transported The Physically Challenged Guests

0:41:15.820,0:41:19.060
And we know that the driver has made a lot of sacrifice to be here

0:41:19.060,0:41:22.560
and to give up his time to be with you and help you.

0:41:22.560,0:41:27.400
So we also want to give him a gift of 5,000 naira.

0:41:27.400,0:41:31.380
Cash Gifts, Transport Money And Rice Were Given To All The Drivers Who Transported The Physically Challenged Guests

0:41:31.380,0:41:36.100
We want to give the driver two bags of rice.

0:41:36.100,0:41:39.580

0:41:39.580,0:41:45.620
...mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:41:45.620,0:41:51.580
I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has done for us.

0:41:51.580,0:41:53.940
God will continue to bless him for what he has done for us.

0:41:53.940,0:41:56.520
Thank you very much.

0:41:56.520,0:41:58.180
Thank you.

0:41:58.180,0:42:26.260
...mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:42:26.260,0:42:45.300
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:42:45.300,0:42:50.040
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:42:50.040,0:43:03.440
The Physically Challenged Guests Are Transported Back To Their Various Homes With Their Gifts

0:43:03.440,0:43:09.360
...as the reason for relationship

0:43:09.360,0:43:18.760
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:43:18.760,0:43:23.660
When we give, we receive more of...

0:43:23.660,0:43:27.260
Bye bye

0:43:27.260,0:43:36.860
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:43:36.860,0:43:49.380
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:43:49.380,0:44:07.180
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:44:07.180,0:44:15.640
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:44:15.640,0:44:24.380
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:44:24.380,0:44:33.600
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:44:33.600,0:44:46.200
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:44:46.200,0:45:46.260
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:45:46.260,0:45:48.600
My name is Yemisi Salami.

0:45:48.600,0:45:52.280
I am from Akure, Women With Diabilities.

0:45:52.280,0:45:56.520
The main reason why I am here is for the man of God to help me

0:45:56.520,0:46:00.240
because walking is not easy for me.

0:46:00.240,0:46:05.340
I am a bit big; so it is not easy for me.

0:46:05.340,0:46:09.920
And today, God Almighty has met you at the point of your need.

0:46:09.920,0:46:14.580
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, together with the Emmanuel TV Partners from all over the world,

0:46:14.580,0:46:18.780
has provided this wheelchair for you and a cash gift of 5,000 naira

0:46:18.780,0:46:23.080
and also two bags of rice. How are you feeling now?

0:46:23.080,0:46:26.260
I am feeling very happy and very great.

0:46:26.260,0:46:32.320
I really thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:46:32.320,0:46:33.680
They have been helping us.

0:46:33.680,0:46:38.480
They never leave us or make us feel that we are different.

0:46:38.480,0:46:43.060
I just want to say thank you. God bless you, continuously.

0:46:43.060,0:46:45.920
We pray that you will be in prosperous, in Jesus' name.

0:46:45.920,0:46:46.820
Amen.

0:46:46.820,0:46:50.800
You are welcome to the physically challenged meeting with T.B. Joshua

0:46:50.800,0:46:55.380
today here at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, in Jesus' name.

0:46:55.380,0:46:57.060
Tell us your name and where you are from.

0:46:57.060,0:46:59.540
My name is Abioloa Rahman.

0:46:59.540,0:47:02.300
I am from Disabled Welfare, Lagos.

0:47:02.300,0:47:04.060
Thank you very much.

0:47:04.060,0:47:08.520
Tell us the main reason why you are here at The SCOAN.

0:47:08.520,0:47:10.520
The man of God wants to bless us.

0:47:10.520,0:47:12.120
We really appreciate him.

0:47:12.120,0:47:14.520
He has been showing love and care.

0:47:14.520,0:47:25.140
We want Nigerians to emulate him.

0:47:25.140,0:47:32.740
If other people could emulate him, the way he shows love, care...

0:47:32.740,0:47:36.300
I want Nigerians to emulate the man of God.

0:47:36.300,0:47:46.220
I feel so touched that that kind of a man can be humble to assist the less privileged in society.

0:47:46.220,0:47:51.280
Wow. It is the duty of all Christians because Christians are known by their love

0:47:51.280,0:47:54.820
and the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, really knows this.

0:47:54.820,0:47:59.180
Can you please tell us about the challenges you have been facing so far.

0:47:59.180,0:48:03.480
It is not really easy - someone with a disability in Nigeria.

0:48:03.480,0:48:06.400
We are not recognised. We are neglected.

0:48:06.400,0:48:11.920
So, we are happy for someone like Prophet T.B. Joshua who can remember us.

0:48:11.920,0:48:14.300
Somebody called me that I should come.

0:48:14.300,0:48:18.220
When I came, I didn't expect to be given a wheelchair.

0:48:18.220,0:48:22.920
But I thank God. God blessed me today with the man of God.

0:48:22.920,0:48:24.700
Wow. We thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:48:24.700,0:48:27.460
It shows that Jesus Christ knows who you are,

0:48:27.460,0:48:32.520
He knows the design of your heart and He has met you today at the point of your need

0:48:32.520,0:48:36.620
through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.

0:48:36.620,0:48:41.800
You have received today a cash gift, two bags of rice and also a wheelchair.

0:48:41.800,0:48:44.940
And how are you feeling now after receiving all these?

0:48:44.940,0:48:48.120
I feel great. I am very happy.

0:48:48.120,0:48:53.160
I pray that the good Lord will bless the church and the man of God.

0:48:53.160,0:48:57.700
Blessed be the name of the Lord; that God will bless His people and the man of God

0:48:57.700,0:49:01.140
more and more abundantly, in Jesus' name.

0:49:01.140,0:49:03.720
Amen. Thank you very much for coming.

0:49:03.720,0:49:07.800
We pray to see you again next time, in Jesus' name.

0:49:07.800,0:49:10.820
...back to us

0:49:10.820,0:49:28.760
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:49:28.760,0:49:37.400
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:49:37.400,0:49:42.280
Just as receiving is the reason for...

0:49:42.280,0:49:45.340
My name is Tunrayo Ajetunmobi.

0:49:45.340,0:49:48.920
I'm from Kwara State (Nigeria); Lagos State Disabled Association.

0:49:48.920,0:49:53.280
This is not my first time of coming here. This is my third time of coming here.

0:49:53.280,0:49:56.500
For long, I have been in need of a wheelchair

0:49:56.500,0:50:00.220
but there was nobody to help me get one.

0:50:00.220,0:50:03.820
If I walk too much, I have back pain and side pain.

0:50:03.820,0:50:06.620
So, sometimes, it would make me not to go out.

0:50:06.620,0:50:10.220
Right here at the physcially challenged meeting with T.B. Joshua,

0:50:10.220,0:50:14.020
God Almighty, Jesus Christ, has met you at the point of your need.

0:50:14.020,0:50:20.280
You have received a cash gift of 5,000 naira from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:50:20.280,0:50:25.720
and also two bags of rice and a wheelchair as you have requested today

0:50:25.720,0:50:30.260
from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV Partners from all over the world.

0:50:30.260,0:50:32.100
How are you feeling now?

0:50:32.100,0:50:37.400
I am very grateful. I thank T.B. Joshua for showing love to us.

0:50:37.400,0:50:39.760
Titilayo Mosunbola.

0:50:39.760,0:50:41.740
I am from Lagos State (Nigeria).

0:50:41.740,0:50:44.860
How did you hear about this meeting?

0:50:44.860,0:50:48.600
I've heard a lot from my friends who had been here before me

0:50:48.600,0:50:52.580
telling me the good things that the man of God has been doing for them.

0:50:52.580,0:50:57.640
He is a very friendly person with those who have been marginalised against,

0:50:57.640,0:51:00.420
like the dwarves and physically challenged persons.

0:51:00.420,0:51:03.480
So, that was why I came to this place today

0:51:03.480,0:51:08.760
with the expectation of getting a wheelchair and financial assistance.

0:51:08.760,0:51:13.160
We saw you earlier today, coming here to the physcially challenged meeting

0:51:13.160,0:51:16.820
with T.B. Joshua with your own wheelchair.

0:51:16.820,0:51:20.200
I borrowed that one; it is not my own.

0:51:20.200,0:51:22.780
It is a borrowed wheelchair.

0:51:22.780,0:51:27.780
Ok. And today God Almighty, Jesus Christ, has met you at the point of your need

0:51:27.780,0:51:31.640
through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, together with the Emmanuel TV Partners,

0:51:31.640,0:51:34.920
to provide this wheelchair that you are sitting on right now

0:51:34.920,0:51:40.560
and also two bags of rice and a cash gift of 5,000 naira.

0:51:40.560,0:51:45.220
I am very grateful to him and I am very happy within me

0:51:45.220,0:51:48.040
and I want to use this medium to bless the man of God,

0:51:48.040,0:51:52.820
that God will bless and increase him and continue to motivate him.

0:51:52.820,0:51:54.880
More grease to his elbows.

0:51:54.880,0:51:58.680
I am also using this medium to send a message to the whole world

0:51:58.680,0:52:01.840
that people should emulate this great man of God

0:52:01.840,0:52:04.960
because he has left a legacy for us to emulate.

0:52:04.960,0:52:08.920
God will reward all the people who have been supporting.

0:52:08.920,0:52:15.140
All the workers I have seen here today have been very great. God bless you.

0:52:15.140,0:52:20.920
...love

0:52:20.920,0:52:29.560
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:52:29.560,0:52:33.180
Just as receiving is the reason...

0:52:33.180,0:52:36.940
Welcome to The SCOAN today. Tell us your name and where you are from.

0:52:36.940,0:52:38.940
My name is Adeyanju Dare.

0:52:38.940,0:52:40.760
I am from Lagos State (Nigeria).

0:52:40.760,0:52:43.860
You have been in the physically challenged meeting today with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:52:43.860,0:52:45.360
How do you feel?

0:52:45.360,0:52:50.200
I feel so great and happy. I can't express my feelings.

0:52:50.200,0:52:54.660
It is amazing. I really appreciate the man of god.

0:52:54.660,0:52:58.880
The man of God is trying and I pray for more anointing,

0:52:58.880,0:53:02.700
that God will continue to empower him and bless him more.

0:53:02.700,0:53:06.580
As he continues to bless us, so also, God will continue to bless his family.

0:53:06.580,0:53:08.400
Now tell us, what did you receive today?

0:53:08.400,0:53:14.900
Wow! I can say I received blessing, happiness and at the same time,

0:53:14.900,0:53:18.480
I received materials - what is important for me.

0:53:18.480,0:53:22.080
I really enjoyed it and I received everything - every quality thing -

0:53:22.080,0:53:28.220
two bags of rice and raw cash of 5,000 naira.

0:53:28.220,0:53:30.600
It's amazing; it's very great!

0:53:30.600,0:53:35.540
...more of whatever we give

0:53:35.540,0:53:47.920
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:53:47.920,0:54:05.860
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:54:05.860,0:54:14.300
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

0:54:14.300,0:54:23.040
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

0:54:23.040,0:54:32.300
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

0:54:32.300,0:54:44.960
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

0:54:44.960,0:55:30.560
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

0:55:30.560,0:55:32.800

1:01:40.420,1:01:43.500

(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

1:05:45.920,1:05:49.180
On behalf of our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

1:05:49.180,1:05:51.580
we believe you have enjoyed yourselves

1:05:51.580,1:05:55.460
and you have received a lot of things to give thanks to Jesus.

1:05:55.460,1:05:58.820
So for this reason, the man of God has decided to bless you

1:05:58.820,1:06:01.740
since you have decided to honour his invitation.

1:06:01.740,1:06:05.800
So right here with me, I have an envelope.

1:06:05.800,1:06:22.900
This one contains transportation for everyone inside the vehicle - 15,000 naira.

1:06:22.900,1:06:28.580
And here with me, sir, this is a gift from our father in the Lord, T.B. Joshua - 5,000 naira.

1:06:28.580,1:06:31.980
And here with me are also two bags of rice.

1:06:31.980,1:06:32.980
God bless you!

1:06:32.980,1:06:41.780
We thank our pastor, Pastor Temitope Joshua - a man of the people.

1:06:41.780,1:06:46.180
...love

1:06:46.180,1:06:54.780
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

1:06:54.780,1:06:55.920
Praise the Lord!

1:06:55.920,1:06:56.840
Hallelujah!

1:06:56.840,1:06:58.680
You know that Jesus loves you.

1:06:58.680,1:07:01.760
Thank you for coming here and thank you for accepting the gift.

1:07:01.760,1:07:03.640
Hallelujah!

1:07:03.640,1:07:05.840
The man of God has said you are blessed.

1:07:05.840,1:07:09.800
And all your transport from here to your home, the man of God has paid everything.

1:07:09.800,1:07:12.980
You don't need to pay anything. Everything is provided for.

1:07:12.980,1:07:16.500
So, driver, this is a blessing for you.

1:07:16.500,1:07:22.020
This is for you personally. 5,000 for you.

1:07:22.020,1:07:25.880
And the man of God gives you two bags of rice.

1:07:25.880,1:07:31.220
The Prophet has provided 15,000 to pay for your transport back home.

1:07:31.220,1:07:39.180
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

1:07:39.180,1:07:41.320
When we give...

1:07:41.320,1:07:44.040
My name is Oluwaseyi Ojerinde.

1:07:44.040,1:07:49.740
I want to thank the man of God. He always cares for us.

1:07:49.740,1:07:52.580
God will bless him more and more. Thank you.

1:07:52.580,1:07:54.440
Thank you. God bless you.

1:07:54.440,1:07:56.820
My name is Omobolanle Adams.

1:07:56.820,1:07:59.380
I thank our father for remembering us again.

1:07:59.380,1:08:02.480
We give glory to the Lord for all that he has done for us.

1:08:02.480,1:08:08.580
May the Lord continue to bless him and all the members, in Jesus' name.

1:08:08.580,1:08:10.360
God bless you. Thank you.

1:08:10.360,1:08:17.620
When we give, we receive more of whatever...

1:08:17.620,1:08:22.280
We have here 5,000 naira for the driver of the bus. That is for you, sir.

1:08:22.280,1:08:30.040
And two bags of rice.

1:08:30.040,1:08:38.360
That is not all. We also have 15,000 naira here for all your transportation back home again.

1:08:38.360,1:08:44.480
T.B. Joshua, I thank you very much. God bless you.

1:08:44.480,1:08:56.480
...we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

1:08:56.480,1:09:35.220
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

1:09:35.220,1:09:38.660
Thank you, Man of God!

1:09:38.660,1:09:44.340
Bye.

1:09:44.340,1:09:47.400
...back to us

1:09:47.400,1:09:50.880
Every true friendship in Christ...

1:09:50.880,1:09:54.680
My name is Oluwaseyi David. We came from Rivers State (Nigeria).

1:09:54.680,1:09:56.960
Which group is this?

1:09:56.960,1:09:59.720
This is Disabled Welfare Sports.

1:09:59.720,1:10:01.480
This is our first time.

1:10:01.480,1:10:07.380
We each received 5,000 naira gifts and two bags of rice.

1:10:07.380,1:10:08.700
We are very happy.

1:10:08.700,1:10:11.800
The anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, as he has promised,

1:10:11.800,1:10:15.620
he is paying for your transport fare back to your state - Rivers State.

1:10:15.620,1:10:22.400
That is the sum of 40,000 naira for the eight of you. This is the money.

1:10:22.400,1:10:27.040
We thank the man of God. God will continue to bless him, in Jesus' name.

1:10:27.040,1:10:31.120
Anything he lays his hands upon shall prosper, in Jesus' name.

1:10:31.120,1:10:33.900
Amen. Thank you very much. We wish you a safe journey back.

1:10:33.900,1:10:36.800
My name is Wasiu Yusuf.

1:10:36.800,1:10:38.880
From Osun State (Nigeria). Physically challenged.

1:10:38.880,1:10:43.760
This is the transport money that is for you and all the people that came with you

1:10:43.760,1:10:48.480
from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:10:48.480,1:10:54.120
I want to thank T.B. Joshua. I am very happy about the gifts he gave us,

1:10:54.120,1:10:55.760
including the money for transport.

1:10:55.760,1:10:59.100
God will bless T.B. Joshua. Amen.

1:10:59.100,1:11:03.800
Thank you very much. Let us also hear from the driver who is going to take this group back to their state.

1:11:03.800,1:11:07.160
I am Wasiu Dada; a driver from Osun State (Nigeria).

1:11:07.160,1:11:09.340
I transported them here.

1:11:09.340,1:11:11.880
Driver, what we have here is the transport fee

1:11:11.880,1:11:16.900
for the group of people that came all the way from Osun State so they don't owe you anything.

1:11:16.900,1:11:22.500
The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua is the one paying for their transport back to their state.

1:11:22.500,1:11:25.280
Sir, this is an amount of 15,000 naira.

1:11:25.280,1:11:28.740
I really thank T.B. Joshua and the entire members of the church.

1:11:28.740,1:11:32.220
We also have another special gift for you from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

1:11:32.220,1:11:36.020
for your effort to bring this group to The SCOAN.

1:11:36.020,1:11:41.900
In addition to that, Prophet T.B. Joshua is also blessing you with these two bags of rice.

1:11:41.900,1:11:47.840
So, you have in total received 5,000 naira from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua and two bags of rice

1:11:47.840,1:11:51.740
to bless you for bringing our friends to The SCOAN.

1:11:51.740,1:11:55.700
I don't know what to say. I am thanking the members of the church,

1:11:55.700,1:12:01.640
the whole crew and T.B. Joshua - more grease to his elbows and long life.

1:12:01.640,1:12:25.260
...must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

1:12:25.260,1:12:29.880
And right now we are with the people who have been blessed by the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:12:29.880,1:12:34.380
Right now we are with the driver with the gift that the man of God has given the driver

1:12:34.380,1:12:39.820
which is 5,000 naira and two bags of rice for the driver himself.

1:12:39.820,1:12:45.960
I say thank you. I am so grateful for what the man of God is doing in my life.

1:12:45.960,1:12:47.560
I am so grateful. Thank you.

1:12:47.560,1:12:51.860
I am very grateful to Prophet T.B. Joshua.

Thank you for what you have been doing for us. We are very grateful.

1:12:55.460,1:12:57.220
I am happy.

1:12:57.220,1:13:05.920
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

1:13:05.920,1:13:15.200
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

1:13:15.200,1:13:27.580
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

1:13:27.580,1:14:21.280
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

1:14:21.280,1:14:23.700
Bye bye.

1:14:23.700,1:14:30.860
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

1:14:30.860,1:14:43.460
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

1:14:43.460,1:15:01.120
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

1:15:01.120,1:15:09.660
We should see giving as the reason for relationship

1:15:09.660,1:15:18.420
Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well

1:15:18.420,1:15:27.700
When we give, we receive more of whatever we give

1:15:27.700,1:15:40.100
When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

1:15:40.100,1:16:34.560
Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love

1:16:34.560,1:16:38.060
Man of God, thank you for today!
