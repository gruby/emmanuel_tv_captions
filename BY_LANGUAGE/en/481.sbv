0:00:00.000,0:00:02.720
How are you, brother?

0:00:02.720,0:00:06.480
Are you the one that betrayed this woman or she betrayed you?

0:00:06.480,0:00:07.480
I am the one.

0:00:07.480,0:00:11.700
Thank you. I am happy. This is a Christian.

0:00:11.700,0:00:13.780
How did you betray her?

0:00:13.780,0:00:18.560
That was in the first country I was staying in when I travelled out of Nigeria.

0:00:18.560,0:00:21.660
I had a baby girl with that lady.

0:00:21.660,0:00:25.500
You know at the beginning, that baby girl, you were trying to deny it.

0:00:25.500,0:00:26.900
Exactly.

0:00:26.900,0:00:30.800
Even your voice is still not clear concerning that child.

0:00:30.800,0:00:32.020
Yes.

0:00:32.020,0:00:33.620
The child is living with her?

0:00:33.620,0:00:34.400
Yes, sir.

0:00:34.400,0:00:37.760
What happened was that, when I was in that first country,

0:00:37.760,0:00:40.600
I left the country and went to another place.

0:00:40.600,0:00:43.180
When I got there, I met another person.

0:00:43.180,0:00:47.360
That was the reason I couldn't marry her.

0:00:47.360,0:00:49.340
Where is the child now? Where is the woman?

0:00:49.340,0:00:50.820
She is in Libreville, Gabon.

0:00:50.820,0:00:54.020
When did you hear from the child and the mother last?

0:00:54.020,0:00:56.440
I heard from them two months ago.

0:00:56.440,0:00:57.080
Two months ago?

0:00:57.080,0:00:57.900
Yes.

0:00:57.900,0:01:01.000
What did she tell you because there was something she kept telling you?

0:01:01.000,0:01:02.800
That is the more reason that I called you.

0:01:02.800,0:01:07.060
She told me that she wanted to establish a business,

0:01:07.060,0:01:08.700
that I should establish a business for her,

0:01:08.700,0:01:10.320
So she said that she needs your help.

0:01:10.320,0:01:11.100
Yes.

0:01:11.100,0:01:16.800
She said that she needs your help. Give her money and call her to pray for you.

0:01:16.800,0:01:18.980
She is a faithful lady.

0:01:18.980,0:01:23.500
At the time you met her, after you came into her life, you disfocused her.

0:01:23.500,0:01:25.260
She doesn't know what to do again.

0:01:25.260,0:01:27.580
She doesn't even have a settled home.

0:01:27.580,0:01:28.460
Exactly.

0:01:28.460,0:01:31.680
If it was possible, she would want to marry you back because she cannot marry anybody.

0:01:31.680,0:01:35.380
She told me that I am 'the man of her life'.

0:01:35.380,0:01:39.680
You love her. It is the condition that actually changed you over there.

0:01:39.680,0:01:43.220
You were looking for a way of having a breakthrough.

0:01:43.220,0:01:47.740
Indeed, your heart is for this woman but you cannot go for two again.

0:01:47.740,0:01:50.620
You have to settle with this one and forget that one.

0:01:50.620,0:01:54.740
At this point now you cannot marry her but you should make her happy.

0:01:54.740,0:01:55.540
Thank you, sir.

0:01:55.540,0:01:57.960
Without deliverance, she cannot forget you.

0:01:57.960,0:02:00.120
Without deliverance, she will not marry forever.

0:02:00.120,0:02:02.860
She doesnt have any affection for anybody.

0:02:02.860,0:02:05.680
After the money that you are going to give her,

0:02:05.680,0:02:08.860
give her and her daughter money for her ticket for prayer.

0:02:08.860,0:02:14.700
After the prayer, she can now have affection to get married to somebody.

0:02:14.700,0:02:17.480
She will remain the mother of your child.

0:02:17.480,0:02:21.100
You can be helping her in the future but she will leave you and you will leave her.

0:02:21.100,0:02:22.480
So that is it. Thank you.

0:02:22.480,0:02:28.780
Prophecy Time

0:02:28.780,0:02:30.560
In the name of Jesus!

0:02:30.560,0:02:33.320
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:02:33.320,0:02:37.820
Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name.

0:02:37.820,0:02:43.100
Following the prophecy of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and supported by him,

0:02:43.100,0:02:47.520
the man sent for his daughter and her mother whom he had denied.

0:02:47.520,0:02:54.540
They met once again for the first time in 12 long years at The SCOAN.

0:02:54.540,0:02:57.940
Let's watch the encounter.

0:02:57.940,0:03:00.800
Can you see the power of prophecy?

0:03:00.800,0:03:07.180
This beautiful girl would have lost finally, just like that, if not for the prophecy.

0:03:07.180,0:03:11.920
It was that prophecy that made him agree that he is the father.

0:03:11.920,0:03:14.300
My name is Elijah Chikwendu.

0:03:14.300,0:03:18.840
I am a Nigerian living in DRC.

0:03:18.840,0:03:30.140
What happened was that I was having a lot of challenges in my life.

0:03:30.140,0:03:35.720
I was looking for a way out of the problems.

0:03:35.720,0:03:40.720
I came to The SCOAN last year.

0:03:40.720,0:03:49.800
The man of God prophesied to me that there was a lady I had disappointed.

0:03:49.800,0:03:55.500
I accepted because I knew that the man of God did not know me.

0:03:55.500,0:04:04.400
He prophesied exactly what had happened in my past life.

0:04:04.400,0:04:11.760
He told me to go and bring the girl to Nigeria for deliverance

0:04:11.760,0:04:18.500
so that she could be free and make a new life

0:04:18.500,0:04:24.120
because as you can see right now, I am married with four kids.

0:04:24.120,0:04:30.460
My daughter here - I have not seen her for the past 12 years now.

0:04:30.460,0:04:35.540
As you are seeing her here, this is also my first time of seeing her.

0:04:35.540,0:04:43.780
Man of God, please, I need your help.

0:04:43.780,0:04:48.220
These are the things blocking many of you.

0:04:48.220,0:04:51.140
He said he is seeing her for the first time.

0:04:51.140,0:04:55.440
But you are looking for breakthrough, blessing.

0:04:55.440,0:04:57.680
Witches and wizards are the cause.

0:04:57.680,0:05:02.520
But we don't know the one that we have caused by ourselves.

0:05:02.520,0:05:08.240
99% of our challenges are caused by ourselves.

0:05:08.240,0:05:14.720
So now, when this is settled, you have to take care of the child, pay school fees,

0:05:14.720,0:05:18.460
whatever this woman might have paid for the past 12 years.

0:05:18.460,0:05:24.180
You have to sit down and discuss - reconciliation, give them money

0:05:24.180,0:05:28.340
and take responsibility of your daughter as a father.

0:05:28.340,0:05:33.920
And whatever you need to give to the woman, give it to her and continue as a father.

0:05:33.920,0:05:38.240
And the future is bright.

0:05:38.240,0:05:40.780
The hindrance is removed.

0:05:40.780,0:05:46.160
Many of you don't know that this is the cause of your problems.

0:05:46.160,0:05:50.960
That is why, no matter the prayer you offer, your prayer cannot be answered.

0:05:50.960,0:05:54.700
Because something is there that needs to be removed - mountain.

0:05:54.700,0:05:58.160
No matter the fasting - if you fast for 40 days and 40 nights;

0:05:58.160,0:06:03.880
and pray and go to the mountain, nothing will happen.

0:06:03.880,0:06:09.060
Unless you meet a man of God that will tell you, "This is the mountain that you need to move".

0:06:09.060,0:06:13.160
If you move this mountain and say "Jesus!", Jesus will hear you.

0:06:13.160,0:06:16.740
But if you don't move that mountain and you keep shouting "Jesus!" -

0:06:16.740,0:06:20.980
something is blocking you - between you and Jesus.

0:06:20.980,0:06:23.100
Sometimes you say, "You pray, you fast".

0:06:23.100,0:06:25.240
Many of you say, "I am a Christian now".

0:06:25.240,0:06:27.740
Now you start being faithful, kind.

0:06:27.740,0:06:29.840
If you were a drunkard, you stop drinking.

0:06:29.840,0:06:31.760
If you were a liar, you stop lying.

0:06:31.760,0:06:34.000
If you were a thief, you stop stealing.

0:06:34.000,0:06:35.980
You start living a good life

0:06:35.980,0:06:37.780
People start to say,  "He is a Christian now".

0:06:37.780,0:06:40.500
But yet, the life has not changed.

0:06:40.500,0:06:45.520
People say, "But this man has stopped going to the night club, he is now going to church.

0:06:45.520,0:06:49.900
He is even an elder in the church, he fasts, he is an usher,

0:06:49.900,0:06:54.080
he is an elder, he is everything, he is always at home, he is preaching the gospel,

0:06:54.080,0:06:56.940
but his life has not changed. Why?"

0:06:56.940,0:06:59.380
There is a hindrance.

0:06:59.380,0:07:03.440
All that kindness, goodness - God is not hearing it.

0:07:03.440,0:07:07.340
Until that hindrance is removed.

0:07:07.340,0:07:13.660
Mountain
You gonna move, oh mountain

0:07:13.660,0:07:20.800
You gonna move
I say right now in the name of Jesus

0:07:20.800,0:07:26.960
Mountain
You gonna move

0:07:26.960,0:07:30.000
It is a lesson. It is not what happened to this man that matters now

0:07:30.000,0:07:33.940
but the lesson you will learn today from this matter.

0:07:33.940,0:07:40.660
The lesson you will learn today is more important than what the man is saying.

0:07:40.660,0:07:47.380
Man of God, the prophecy you gave to me is actually true.

0:07:47.380,0:07:50.140
What happened is that after the prophecy,

0:07:50.140,0:07:54.040
there were some certain things I remembered which I did

0:07:54.040,0:08:00.700
and before the prophecy, all these things had not yet come to my senses.

0:08:00.700,0:08:06.780
After the prophecy, I remembered that when she gave birth to my baby,

0:08:06.780,0:08:12.320
there was something that I went to their family house to do.

0:08:12.320,0:08:16.340
It was a kind of presentation for the family, without knowing

0:08:16.340,0:08:23.380
that it would have an impact on her or on myself in the future.

0:08:23.380,0:08:29.580
It was after the prophecy that I realised that in their place,

0:08:29.580,0:08:36.760
it means that she would be waiting for me.

0:08:36.760,0:08:43.980
Now, as it is, I am married; she is not married yet.

0:08:43.980,0:08:47.980
Man of God, please, now that I am married,

0:08:47.980,0:08:50.940
I want you to help me to break the covenant

0:08:50.940,0:08:55.640
so that this woman will be set free and remarry.

0:08:55.640,0:08:56.980
Okay.

0:08:56.980,0:08:59.800
This woman needs to be set free.

0:08:59.800,0:09:04.200
This woman needs to be delivered so that she can remove her mind from this man.

0:09:04.200,0:09:11.240
Because for the past 15 years, she still believed that this man was her husband.

0:09:11.240,0:09:15.880
Therefore, no one is like this man to her.

0:09:15.880,0:09:16.840
No one!

0:09:16.840,0:09:19.180
If she just sees anyone - a handsome man -

0:09:19.180,0:09:23.080
she just says, "He is not as fat as this man".

0:09:23.080,0:09:26.600
If she sees another one - "He is not as short as this man."

0:09:26.600,0:09:35.420
If she sees another one - "He doesn't know how to kiss like this man."

0:09:35.420,0:09:37.200
There is trouble!

0:09:37.200,0:09:44.600
That covenant needs to be broken so that the woman can be free.

0:09:44.600,0:09:47.680
Okay, this is your little girl?

0:09:47.680,0:09:49.320
Yes.

0:09:49.320,0:09:54.220
So we are going to talk, what this woman has spent on this girl.

0:09:54.220,0:09:57.320
How much? - I am going to sit at the meeting

0:09:57.320,0:10:01.060
and you are going to take care of this daughter.

0:10:01.060,0:10:03.240
You are also going to establish this woman -

0:10:03.240,0:10:08.340
whatever you can give her to start her life after the deliverance so that they can go.

0:10:08.340,0:10:11.880
The restitution of this little girl will be your responsibility.

0:10:11.880,0:10:27.180
Whatever she might have spent in the past from when this girl was a baby, we have to return it.

0:10:27.180,0:10:31.380
That is restitution, not just deliverance.

0:10:31.380,0:10:33.760
It will go with restitution.

0:10:33.760,0:10:39.360
We take care of this girl, and the lady will go and visit you and take you as her father.

0:10:39.360,0:10:41.560
And you too will go to her house to greet.

0:10:41.560,0:10:45.520
You should let your wife at home know. I want to see her too.

0:10:45.520,0:10:51.540
To let her know that this lady is part of the family.

0:10:51.540,0:10:54.060
It is not something you do secretly.

0:10:54.060,0:10:59.100
Because if you do this secretly, it will not look polite.

0:10:59.100,0:11:02.060
You have to let her know; and I will let her know.

0:11:02.060,0:11:07.780
It is not going to disturb your marriage but know, she is part of the family.

0:11:07.780,0:11:09.960
Thank you very much.

0:11:09.960,0:11:13.780
Man of God, please, help me to beg them to forgive me - even my daughter.

0:11:13.780,0:11:19.540
Since Saturday, she couldn't come near me; she was always crying.

0:11:19.540,0:11:22.120
Because she doesn't know you.

0:11:22.120,0:11:26.180
She had your picture when she was very small.

0:11:26.180,0:11:34.680
Imagine how you were looking 12 years ago and how you are looking now.

0:11:34.680,0:11:38.620
After the service we will settle everything; everything will be fine.

0:11:38.620,0:11:42.180
How are you? Where are you from?

0:11:42.180,0:11:44.480
We are from Gabon.

0:11:44.480,0:11:45.960
Okay.

0:11:45.960,0:11:47.700
You are welcome!

0:11:47.700,0:11:50.260
Explain my own side, please.

0:11:50.260,0:12:30.780
The SCOAN Service

0:12:30.780,0:12:35.760
Let the mother and the daughter know that God is in control.

0:12:35.760,0:12:38.480
After the service, I want to meet them.

0:12:38.480,0:12:43.020
She will receive complete deliverance so she can see her real value

0:12:43.020,0:12:45.520
and how to move forward.

0:12:45.520,0:12:52.120
I want her to forgive this gentleman here because God has forgiven the gentleman.

0:12:52.120,0:12:56.560
So, she has to forgive the gentleman and he will do the right thing.

0:12:56.560,0:13:16.460
The SCOAN Service

0:13:16.460,0:13:19.200
Let me talk to the little girl.

0:13:19.200,0:13:30.000
Why was she running from her father?

0:13:30.000,0:13:34.220
He abandoned me.

0:13:34.220,0:13:37.040
Don't ask her another question, please.

0:13:37.040,0:13:38.240
Come!

0:13:38.240,0:13:45.160
The SCOAN Service

0:13:45.160,0:13:49.960
Don't worry, okay? I am going to see her immediately after the service.

0:13:49.960,0:13:54.980
And she will be very happy because God is involved.

0:13:54.980,0:13:59.280
God is involved!

0:13:59.280,0:14:00.640
Can you see?

0:14:00.640,0:14:03.900
She has no word to qualify that.

0:14:03.900,0:14:07.280
A very sharp word: He has abandoned me!

0:14:07.280,0:14:12.240
Not trying to explain herself - He has abandoned me!

0:14:12.240,0:14:15.780
In a hasty way. Can you see the bitterness!

0:14:15.780,0:14:19.280
So don't worry. I want to see you.

0:14:19.280,0:14:24.640
How old is she now?

0:14:24.640,0:14:27.800
I am 14 years old.

0:14:27.800,0:14:29.760
It means, she was two years old.

0:14:29.760,0:14:34.900
There is no way she could recognise this man.

0:14:34.900,0:14:36.020
Thank you.

0:14:36.020,0:14:38.800
She is my guest, I invited them.

0:14:38.800,0:14:45.320
I want to thank them for obeying this message, for coming down to Nigeria.

It means, something can block one.

0:15:27.740,0:15:29.960
No matter how faithful you are.

0:15:29.960,0:15:32.060
No matter how kind you are.

0:15:32.060,0:15:36.900
No matter how nice, humble and obedient to God.

If something stands against you, that your obedience is self-obedience.

0:15:45.160,0:15:47.880
Self-faithfulness.
