Ah! Yes! I think you give me some of your time

0:13:14.720,0:13:20.700
before you set up the table for the stomach.

0:13:20.700,0:13:24.660
Because I know you have done a lot, you have wrestled with...

0:13:24.660,0:13:30.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:30.940,0:13:36.000
How do you feel, if I just remain silent and quiet,

0:13:36.000,0:13:39.060
looking at your face and you are looking at my face?

0:13:39.060,0:13:43.460
What will be going on in your heart?

0:13:43.460,0:13:47.320
No, no, I will be silent for a while.

0:13:47.320,0:13:51.280
You too, I do not know what you will choose to do.

0:13:51.280,0:13:54.820
But I want to remain silent, looking at you, looking everywhere.

0:13:54.820,0:13:57.060
Tell me how you will feel!

0:13:57.060,0:14:00.540
Do you actually enjoy it if I remain silent, looking at you?

0:14:00.540,0:14:01.720
No!

0:14:01.720,0:14:04.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service.

0:14:04.100,0:14:05.040
Wow.

0:14:05.040,0:14:06.080
Do you mean it?

0:14:06.080,0:14:06.960
Yes!

0:14:06.960,0:14:14.220
I just say, let me give you some time to think about all these exercises you have done today,

0:14:14.220,0:14:19.800
and the testimonies you have received today too - you need time to think about them.

0:14:19.800,0:14:22.000
Ah...

0:14:22.000,0:14:27.980
Viewers at home, I know you are trying to remove your plates, arrange the table...

0:14:27.980,0:14:30.780
OK! Hallelujah!

0:14:30.780,0:14:31.880
Amen!

0:14:31.880,0:14:42.100
So today, we shall talk about some very simple issues but they are not simple.

0:14:42.100,0:14:47.760
The challenges we are facing today - we put ourselves where we are not

0:14:47.760,0:14:52.160
when it comes to things of the Spirit.

0:14:52.160,0:15:01.300
If there is any "simplest" Bible than the one we have, I would have asked you to be reading it.

0:15:01.300,0:15:06.320
It is like this Bible seems to be a bit difficult for you to understand,

0:15:06.320,0:15:13.260
because we twist everything; everything about God, we twist it.

0:15:13.260,0:15:22.860
God has no tongue but our tongue to tell you that what you are doing is wrong.

0:15:22.860,0:15:27.620
It is all about this issue of faith.

0:15:27.620,0:15:39.540
I realize that we base our spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.

0:15:39.540,0:15:41.500
We do not know the difference.

0:15:41.500,0:15:51.480
Our spiritual experiences - we base them on feelings and emotions.

0:15:51.480,0:15:53.600
Today, this is what I am saying.

0:15:53.600,0:15:57.420
These are the challenges we are having all over the world today.

0:15:57.420,0:16:05.200
So many churches, prayer houses, you hear the noise of people every day,

0:16:05.200,0:16:13.900
but it is like Heaven does not know or hear.

0:16:13.900,0:16:15.780
- Are you with me?
- Yes!

0:16:15.780,0:16:21.240
People are men of prayer but perhaps not of faith.

0:16:21.240,0:16:22.460
Tell your neighbor.

0:16:22.460,0:16:26.780
People are men of prayer but perhaps not of faith.

0:16:26.780,0:16:28.460
I cannot hear you!

0:16:28.460,0:16:33.700
People are men of prayer perhaps not of faith.

0:16:33.700,0:16:36.760
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name...!

0:16:36.760,0:16:42.700
They are men of prayer but perhaps not of faith.

0:16:42.700,0:16:48.680
This means, we are saying words, not praying prayer.

0:16:48.680,0:16:59.620
You know, there is a difference between saying words and praying prayer.

0:16:59.620,0:17:05.780
When you base your spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions,

0:17:05.780,0:17:13.720
you will find yourself saying words not praying prayer.

0:17:13.720,0:17:21.720
Today, people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.

0:17:21.720,0:17:29.380
And we all know that feelings are influenced by what we see, hear, read,

0:17:29.380,0:17:33.760
what our circumstances look like.

0:17:33.760,0:17:40.960

0:17:40.960,0:17:48.300
Many are not here today because their vehicle's engine knocked.

0:17:48.300,0:17:53.520
And who gave to them that vehicle?

0:17:53.520,0:17:59.820
Many are not here today because they have some assignment, meeting.

0:17:59.820,0:18:03.240
They need to attend the meeting and they have to avoid coming here.

0:18:03.240,0:18:08.600
And God is ONLY, not one of those things.

0:18:08.600,0:18:10.780
The SCOAN Service

0:18:10.780,0:18:14.840
You are here today because there is no serious commitment.

0:18:14.840,0:18:20.060
Today is a free day; there is no serious commitment, no job, nothing...

0:18:20.060,0:18:26.640
You cannot just be sitting at home that is why you are here.

0:18:26.640,0:18:32.360
And serious things too can take you out of here, if you receive a phone call concerning your business,

0:18:32.360,0:18:34.900
and you learn that that business is "click",

0:18:34.900,0:18:41.940
you need to receive millions today - you have to walk out of the church.

0:18:41.940,0:18:50.280
Problems arise when feelings and emotions change.

0:18:50.280,0:18:52.660
The SCOAN Sundays Service

0:18:52.660,0:19:02.920
Let's take a look at the Book of John 13:34 as our proof text.

0:19:02.920,0:19:08.520
"A new commandment I give you: Love one another."

0:19:08.520,0:19:10.140
Listen to that!

0:19:10.140,0:19:14.600
"A new commandment I give you: Love one another.

0:19:14.600,0:19:23.100
As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

0:19:23.100,0:19:34.540
By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

0:19:34.540,0:19:39.720
It means in this case, the Lord is saying: "Love your neighbour",

0:19:39.720,0:19:41.940
and your neighbour can be your enemy,

0:19:41.940,0:19:46.000
can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.

0:19:46.000,0:19:49.720
He says: "Love them".

0:19:49.720,0:19:55.240
Overflow Congregation

0:19:55.240,0:19:58.980
How will you love them without faith?

0:19:58.980,0:20:04.280
Our faith must be stable, must be consistent.

0:20:04.280,0:20:13.540
For faith to be stable and consistent, it must be based on something with more stability

0:20:13.540,0:20:18.400
than our feelings, than our emotions.

0:20:18.400,0:20:23.940
The Word of God - the same yesterday, today and forever and it will continue to be the same.

0:20:23.940,0:20:27.900
Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:20:27.900,0:20:37.020
You are not saved because you feel you are saved.

0:20:37.020,0:20:45.260
You are saved because you have put your faith in God's Word and acted on it.

0:20:45.260,0:20:53.460
When you act on the Word, you bring Jesus on the scene instantly.

0:20:53.460,0:21:02.120
Whatever we are doing today, without acting on the Word, we cannot bring Jesus on the scene.

0:21:02.120,0:21:08.540
We continue to shout and shout, "Ah!"

0:21:08.540,0:21:18.820
To realise this, the Word must prevail in our lives.

0:21:18.820,0:21:28.080
You cannot be known as a child of God, as born again unless the Word prevails in your life.

0:21:28.080,0:21:30.900
This is what the Bible says here:

0:21:30.900,0:21:38.660
"By this every one will know that you are my disciples if you love one another".

0:21:38.660,0:21:47.340
You cannot be known as a child of God unless the Word of God prevails.

0:21:47.340,0:22:04.120
For now you are carnal because you are ruled by the senses.

0:22:04.120,0:22:11.600
Because you are ruled by feelings, by emotions,

0:22:11.600,0:22:21.340
you are carnal and to be carnally minded is death.

0:22:21.340,0:22:30.120
Remember, as a child of God, you are a spirit.

0:22:30.120,0:22:37.980
Listen to your spirit and obey it;

0:22:37.980,0:22:44.420
your spirit is controlled by the Holy Spirit.

0:22:44.420,0:22:52.840
But the life we live today, the so called Christian is carnal.

0:22:52.840,0:22:59.900
It has not happened until it happens to you,

0:22:59.900,0:23:06.900
until you see, until you touch, until you hear.

0:23:06.900,0:23:24.500
When others are giving testimony, you say, "Until I give my own testimony, I will not believe."

0:23:24.500,0:23:31.560
When others are giving thanks to God, shouting, "Hallelujah!",

0:23:31.560,0:23:39.940
you are trying to see what happens before you can say, "Hallelujah".

0:23:39.940,0:23:49.160
Many of us are here today to see by yourselves.

0:23:49.160,0:23:53.940
Our circumstances dictate the direction to follow.

0:23:53.940,0:23:59.040
When there is money here, we say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:23:59.040,0:24:06.220
When there is no money, "Jesus, be cursed!"

0:24:06.220,0:24:12.100
When there is food on the table, we say, "Hallelujah!"

0:24:12.100,0:24:19.000
But when there is no food on the table, "Let Jesus be cursed!"

0:24:19.000,0:24:28.000
This is life depending on senses and feelings.

0:24:28.000,0:24:37.080
You hear noise of prayer everywhere; prayer houses...

0:24:37.080,0:24:45.420
People are praying but perhaps not of faith,

0:24:45.420,0:24:48.600
and only faith pleases God.

0:24:48.600,0:24:51.580
Only faith hears God.

0:24:51.580,0:24:57.820
Only faith reaches God.

0:24:57.820,0:25:04.160
In 1 Corinthians 3:3...

0:25:04.160,0:25:16.260
When the Word has not prevailed, we walk in poverty,

0:25:16.260,0:25:29.120
and our testimony is only of needs and lack.

0:25:29.120,0:25:43.740
When the Word prevails in our lives, we use the knowledge that is given to us in the Word.

0:25:43.740,0:25:50.960
Do not forget, it is the Word that taught us the value of the name, Jesus.

0:25:50.960,0:25:55.720
It is the Word that taught us the authority of the name, Jesus

0:25:55.720,0:26:03.380
and our legal right to use the name, Jesus.

0:26:03.380,0:26:11.160
When the Word prevails in your life, you have what God says you have,

0:26:11.160,0:26:21.980
you can do what God says you can do and you are what God says you are.

0:26:21.980,0:26:29.300
The question you need to ask yourself is, "Am I a child of God?"

0:26:29.300,0:26:33.860
Because the Bible says, you will never be known as a child of God

0:26:33.860,0:26:39.940
if the Word has not prevailed in your life.

0:26:39.940,0:26:48.020
Acting on the Word brings Jesus on the scene.

0:26:48.020,0:26:50.880
Are you a child of God?

0:26:50.880,0:26:53.200
That is a question you need to ask yourself.

0:26:53.200,0:26:58.100
Am I a child of God?

0:26:58.100,0:27:00.540
Question for you to answer.

0:27:00.540,0:27:02.820
Ask your neighbour, "Are you a child of God?"

0:27:02.820,0:27:04.520
Are you a child of God?

0:27:04.520,0:27:07.840
That is the question for you to answer.

0:27:07.840,0:27:10.820
I will not ask you; you will answer it on your own.

0:27:10.820,0:27:14.800
Am I a child of God?

0:27:14.800,0:27:21.960
Are you praying prayer or are you saying words?

0:27:21.960,0:27:23.920
FAITH IS NOT A FEELING

0:27:23.920,0:27:35.640
These two; which I believe today, 90% of Christians all over the world are saying words not praying prayer.

0:27:35.640,0:27:38.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service.

0:27:38.960,0:27:43.220
Are you one of the 90%?

0:27:43.220,0:27:49.980
You go to the mountain to pray and fast; praying, praying, praying.

0:27:49.980,0:27:57.320
Ask your neighbour, "Are you saying words or praying prayer?"

0:27:57.320,0:27:58.980
I cannot hear you!

0:27:58.980,0:28:01.500
Are you saying words or are you praying prayer?

0:28:01.500,0:28:11.020
If you are saying words, each time you are saying words not praying prayer - attack.

0:28:11.020,0:28:14.680
Don't forget the seven sons of Sceva.

0:28:14.680,0:28:18.760
They said, ''In Jesus' name!''

0:28:18.760,0:28:21.200
It is like honey.

0:28:21.200,0:28:25.960
Wherever you drop honey, insects seek.

0:28:25.960,0:28:28.000
Insects.

0:28:28.000,0:28:34.720
When you say, "Jesus!", satan and his demons, "Who is calling the name?"

0:28:34.720,0:28:36.920
It is like a tiger here.

0:28:36.920,0:28:39.860
You will see how you will begin to run.

0:28:39.860,0:28:47.520
They begin to run, "Who is calling the name? By what authority are you calling that name?"

0:28:47.520,0:28:56.700
By the time they know, you have no authority, you have no legal right to call the name "Jesus", they attack you.

0:28:56.700,0:29:03.580
These are the attacks many of you receive today.

0:29:03.580,0:29:05.740
You say, "Jesus!"

0:29:05.740,0:29:08.840
"Eh,eh,eh - that name! Who is calling? Who is calling?"

0:29:08.840,0:29:11.060
They want to know who is calling.

0:29:11.060,0:29:15.780
They will now look - "By what authority?"

0:29:15.780,0:29:21.260
And they realise that you are saying words, not praying prayer.

0:29:21.260,0:29:23.560
They attack you.

0:29:23.560,0:29:26.720
Different attacks you are having today.

0:29:26.720,0:29:29.000
You say you pray - attack.

0:29:29.000,0:29:36.000
You pray - nightmare, because you are not praying, you are saying words.

0:29:36.000,0:29:38.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:38.360,0:29:51.240
When that name is pronounced, if the Word prevails in your life, it will show in your posture.

0:29:51.240,0:29:57.140
We can see it in your voice, if you are truly born again.

0:29:57.140,0:30:03.520
When you talk, one will know this is a born again.

0:30:03.520,0:30:06.160
Your posture, your dominion...

0:30:06.160,0:30:08.540
A born again, when a born again is going...

0:30:08.540,0:30:11.820
When you see the dominion, when you see the born again, you will know.

0:30:11.820,0:30:18.260
Many of you look around, just look around - this one is just fat, just tall, just good appearance -

0:30:18.260,0:30:23.640
he is empty for satan.

0:30:23.640,0:30:32.420
In your posture, one can see if you are born again, one can see it in your voice.

0:30:32.420,0:30:40.800
Your dominion, your countenance: "Ah, this is a born again."

0:30:40.800,0:30:43.600
You will see it clearly.

0:30:43.600,0:30:47.120
Satan just looks:

0:30:47.120,0:30:52.200
- Jesus!
- Hm! This voice is not of a born again.

0:30:52.200,0:30:57.760
That is how they got the seven sons of Sceva.

0:30:57.760,0:30:59.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:59.780,0:31:12.040
You can see it in his posture, in his dominion, in his appearance, in his voice, when a born again talks.

0:31:12.040,0:31:18.020
Jesus - power; power - Jesus.

0:31:18.020,0:31:23.600
Born again - power; power - born again.

0:31:23.600,0:31:28.260
Christian - power; power - Christian. That is it!

0:31:28.260,0:31:33.720
He moves - power; long turn with power; look with power;

0:31:33.720,0:31:39.720
the voice - power; the posture - power; dominion...

0:31:39.720,0:31:49.060
I just have to bring you back to what you have underestimated, belittle.

0:31:49.060,0:31:56.860
The message is for little children, but you are very very little, you are a kindergarden before God,

0:31:56.860,0:32:03.580
because of the things of the spirit.

0:32:03.580,0:32:19.280
I have no power of my own

0:32:19.280,0:32:30.120
Holy Spirit I look upon You 
Help me

0:32:30.120,0:32:39.700
I have no power of my own

0:32:39.700,0:32:48.160
Right now, begin to pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.

0:32:48.160,0:32:52.060
Pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.

0:32:52.060,0:32:54.440
Right now, while you are sitting down, begin...

0:32:54.440,0:32:56.040
Open your lips.

0:32:56.040,0:33:04.080
Pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.

0:33:04.080,0:33:23.980
Be the Spirit of adoption to me, Holy Spirit!

0:33:23.980,0:33:29.820
Rise up!

0:33:29.820,0:33:32.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service.

0:33:32.660,0:33:38.220
Oh, how I love Jesus!

0:33:38.220,0:33:42.140
Open your lips; begin to pray the character of the Holy Ghost.

0:33:42.140,0:33:45.720
Pray the character of the Holy Ghost into your life.

0:33:45.720,0:33:59.280
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me

0:33:59.280,0:34:02.820
Pray the character of the Holy Ghost into your life!

0:34:02.820,0:34:08.440
Be the Spirit of adoption to me!

0:34:08.440,0:34:25.980
Oh how I love Jesus

0:34:25.980,0:34:42.640
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me.

0:34:42.640,0:34:47.680
Begin to pray the character of the Holy Ghost into your life.

0:34:47.680,0:34:52.680
Be the Spirit of adoption to me in the name of Jesus!

0:34:52.680,0:34:55.320
In Jesus Christ's name we pray!

0:34:55.320,0:34:56.340
Amen!

0:34:56.340,0:35:01.740
- I cannot hear your voice! 
- Amen!

0:35:01.740,0:35:04.720
Ask your neighbour: "Where are you?"

0:35:04.720,0:35:07.540
Because some of you are not here.

0:35:07.540,0:35:11.540
Are you here?

0:35:11.540,0:35:15.120
- You, you are here? 
- Yes!

0:35:15.120,0:35:17.840
We shall know; let us continue!

0:35:17.840,0:35:21.500
If you are not here, let us invite you in.

0:35:21.500,0:35:27.540
I say you have two natures in one person - you and your divine.

0:35:27.540,0:35:29.380
- Hallelujah! 
- Amen!

0:35:29.380,0:35:35.480
As a Christian, you are not human, you are a spirit.

0:35:35.480,0:35:45.140
You listen to your spirit, obey your spirit because your spirit is under the control of the Holy Ghost.

0:35:45.140,0:36:15.920
Hallelujah

0:36:15.920,0:36:20.240
Remain quiet.

0:36:20.240,0:36:23.580
Allow yourself...

0:36:23.580,0:36:28.940
Your heart is the contact point; your heart is the prayer room.

0:36:28.940,0:36:33.780
Where is your heart?

0:36:33.780,0:36:35.560
Mean it.

0:36:35.560,0:36:38.820
Whatever you say, mean it!

0:36:38.820,0:36:42.360
Mean it.

0:36:42.360,0:37:13.840
Hallelujah

0:37:13.840,0:37:22.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:22.020,0:37:26.080
Right now, ask Him to give you faith to believe.

0:37:26.080,0:37:33.400
You want Him to give you faith to believe.

0:37:33.400,0:37:38.860
Give me faith, Lord, to believe.

0:37:38.860,0:37:42.380
Not "I believe, help my unbelief".

0:37:42.380,0:37:50.680
Give me faith to believe.

0:37:50.680,0:37:57.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:57.920,0:38:05.940
- In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
- Amen!

0:38:05.940,0:38:14.420
Every anxiety, depression, downcast,

0:38:14.420,0:38:17.540
worry about now and your future...

0:38:17.540,0:38:18.720
Out!

0:38:18.720,0:38:22.120
You know that cannot happen in the presence of God.

0:38:22.120,0:38:31.820
When you stand before Him and you begin to worry about now and the future - this is torture of satan.

0:38:31.820,0:38:35.120
That is the way satan tortures people.

0:38:35.120,0:38:37.900
You begin to worry.

0:38:37.900,0:38:44.040
With Him all things are possible: Why should you begin to worry about now and your future?

0:38:44.040,0:38:48.140
Leave it for Him; do not worry yourself!

0:38:48.140,0:38:55.320
You need a free spirit now; you want to be free, you want to leave it for Him.

0:38:55.320,0:38:59.580
With Him all things are possible.

0:38:59.580,0:39:12.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:12.220,0:39:14.400
Thank You, Lord!

0:39:14.400,0:39:17.420
In Jesus Christ's name! 
Amen!

0:39:17.420,0:39:20.360
- I cannot hear you! 
- Amen!

0:39:20.360,0:39:26.860
- You mean it? 
- Amen!

0:39:26.860,0:39:27.740
Thank You, Lord!

0:39:27.740,0:39:31.740
You may be seated, thank you.

0:39:31.740,0:39:35.980
Because many "Amen" can come by senses, by feelings...

0:39:35.980,0:39:38.800
Because you hear people saying, "Amen", you say, "Amen".

0:39:38.800,0:39:42.300
That is feeling, that are just senses we are talking about.

0:39:42.300,0:39:45.780
"Ah! The man said I should say 'Amen', I have to say 'Amen'."

0:39:45.780,0:39:50.140
That is not from your heart.

0:39:50.140,0:39:51.820
This is why I ask you if you mean it,

0:39:51.820,0:39:54.820
or you hear people say "Amen", you say, "Amen".

0:39:54.820,0:39:57.220
you see people sitting down, you sit down,

0:39:57.220,0:40:05.820
when I say "Rise up for prayer", you rise up - not that you really mean to rise up.

0:40:05.820,0:40:07.280
You must mean it.

0:40:07.280,0:40:10.280
Whatever you do must come from your heart.

0:40:10.280,0:40:16.500
Our heart is the contact point of the Holy Ghost.

0:40:16.500,0:40:23.240
You must not go by majority but by God's authority.

0:40:23.240,0:40:29.260
When I say, "Rise up for prayer" and you know your spirit does not agree, you sit down.

0:40:29.260,0:40:37.500
When I say "Amen" or "In Jesus' name" and you know your spirit does not agree, don't say "Amen".

0:40:37.500,0:40:40.040
- In Jesus' name!
- Amen.

0:40:40.040,0:40:43.220
- I cannot hear you.
- Amen!

0:40:43.220,0:40:44.780
Thank you.

0:40:44.780,0:40:53.160
Viewers at home, thank you wherever you are, whatever you are doing now, I know you are with us.

0:40:53.160,0:40:55.520
Hallelujah!

0:40:55.520,0:40:57.180
I know, you are with us.

0:40:57.180,0:41:03.420
Viewers, I know you are with us!

0:41:03.420,0:41:07.140
Distance is not a barrier; you just need God's faith to believe.

0:41:07.140,0:41:11.580
We shall believe that by now, you are there.

0:41:11.580,0:41:13.920
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

0:41:13.920,0:41:22.440
Above all powers
Above all kings

0:41:22.440,0:41:31.160
Above all nature 
And all created things

0:41:31.160,0:41:41.820
Above all wisdom 
And all the ways of men

0:41:41.820,0:41:49.760
You were here 
Before the world began

0:41:49.760,0:41:58.920
Above all kingdoms 
Above all thrones

0:41:58.920,0:42:08.280
Above all wonders 
The world has ever known

0:42:08.280,0:42:18.980
Above all wealth 
And treasures of the earth

0:42:18.980,0:42:28.400
There's no way 
To measure what You're worth

0:42:28.400,0:42:36.780
Crucified 
Laid behind a stone

0:42:36.780,0:42:45.460
You lived to die 
Rejected and alone

0:42:45.460,0:42:54.420
Like a rose 
Trampled on the ground

0:42:54.420,0:43:11.840
You took the fall 
And thought of me above all
