0:00:00.000,0:00:04.660
God has no hands but our hands to do His work today.

0:00:04.660,0:00:08.680
Prophet T.B. Joshua is moving in the midst of the congregation.

0:00:08.680,0:00:14.620
This is not a natural situation but a supernatural battle is taking place

0:00:14.620,0:00:16.820
that is a battle of the ages.

0:00:16.820,0:00:21.500
But we need not fear as children of God - satan is under our feet.

0:00:21.500,0:00:25.620
When the lightning power of God is present as you can see right now,

0:00:25.620,0:00:28.040
satan has to bow and flee.

0:00:28.040,0:00:29.720
I am the queen.

0:00:29.720,0:00:31.940
I destroyed her marriage.

0:00:31.940,0:00:33.200
What have you done to her marriage?

0:00:33.200,0:00:38.260
Her husband is mine; she married my husband.

0:00:38.260,0:00:40.940
I took over the whole man.

0:00:57.320,0:01:04.120
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:04.120,0:01:07.420
My name is Mrs Tayim Anyaelle.

0:01:07.420,0:01:11.220
I am from Cameroon. I'm 26 years of age.

0:01:11.220,0:01:17.500
The problem that brought me to The Synagogue Church of All Nations was the problem of anger -

0:01:17.500,0:01:25.980
severe anger, spirit of masturbation, lust, pornography and lesbianism.

0:01:25.980,0:01:30.020
The anger started from when I lost my  parents.

0:01:30.020,0:01:34.780
I lost my parents at an early age.

0:01:34.780,0:01:39.120
So as a young girl at the age of about 10 years old,

0:01:39.120,0:01:43.620
when I lost my mum, I had an aunt who lived in Ghana.

0:01:43.620,0:01:47.340
She came for me and my elder brother.

0:01:47.340,0:01:50.800
So we went to Ghana to live with her.

0:01:50.800,0:01:56.440
She enrolled me to school (GSS). I wrote the GSS examination that year.

0:01:56.440,0:01:59.500
I was the best student in the whole of Ghana

0:01:59.500,0:02:05.160
My name was even announced on the radio so at that time when you came out the best student,

0:02:05.160,0:02:11.460
they would post you to a special school, and the government would pay or give you scholarship.

0:02:11.460,0:02:14.740
The scholarship would cater for like 80%,

0:02:14.740,0:02:19.100
and your family would just have to pay the remaining few percentage.

0:02:19.100,0:02:22.480
My aunt said that she didn't bring me to Ghana to come and go to school.

0:02:22.480,0:02:24.920
That's how she stopped my education.

0:02:24.920,0:02:35.640
So that anger - that offence - I kept holding on to it.

0:02:35.640,0:02:39.400
Excuse me.

0:02:39.400,0:02:40.840
So that's how I stopped school.

0:02:40.840,0:02:45.480
I became her house help, I was doing all sorts of jobs.

0:02:45.480,0:02:48.360
With no panties on, I would do all the work.

0:02:48.360,0:02:52.680
She didn't care if I ate or wore pants as a young lady.

0:02:52.680,0:02:56.120
This pushed me out and I had to look for friends

0:02:56.120,0:03:02.400
that would help me and this is how I got to know men.

0:03:02.400,0:03:06.100
After a few years - I spent about ten years in Ghana

0:03:06.100,0:03:11.000
and because of this issue I even had a son in Ghana whom I left there.

0:03:11.000,0:03:15.060
So I came back to my country - I found a way to come back to my country.

0:03:15.060,0:03:18.640
I went back to my mum's elder sister - my aunt.

0:03:18.640,0:03:23.880
She sent me back to school (O level); I rewrote my O level examination.

0:03:23.880,0:03:30.440
After ten years of not going to school, I registered for the O level.

0:03:30.440,0:03:32.200
I still passed my exams.

0:03:32.200,0:03:42.120
I registered for eight papers, and I got an A in all the eight papers.

0:03:42.120,0:03:47.460
So by the grace of God after the O level, she looked for a way to put me into veterinary school.

0:03:47.460,0:03:51.760
But that's not what I wanted to do, but since I had no choice -

0:03:51.760,0:03:56.500
you know when you're receiving help from an aunt, you can't command her.

0:03:56.500,0:03:58.400
She tells and directs you.

0:03:58.400,0:04:03.220
So she put me into veterinary school, and that is science.

0:04:03.220,0:04:06.700
I never studied science. I did economics and mathematics.

0:04:06.700,0:04:09.800
So I didn't do well in school, I wanted to leave the school.

0:04:09.800,0:04:15.120
On one of the holidays, I came to Douala where my elder sister lived.

0:04:15.120,0:04:21.640
I spent two weeks holiday with her and by the grace of God, I met my husband.

0:04:21.640,0:04:26.360
When I met my husband, we didn't really know each other

0:04:26.360,0:04:29.940
because I lived in a different town and he was in Douala.

0:04:29.940,0:04:33.600
The school was in Bamenda - in the interior of Bamenda.

0:04:33.600,0:04:35.740
After two weeks, I went back to school.

0:04:35.740,0:04:40.040
After a month he invited me over, and he proposed to me and we got married.

0:04:40.040,0:04:41.720
That's how we just got married.

0:04:41.720,0:04:45.000
I didn't know him as we didn't go through courtship

0:04:45.000,0:04:48.280
so I didn't get to know him and he didn't know me either.

0:04:48.280,0:04:50.380
We didn't know the other's weaknesses.

0:04:50.380,0:04:55.280
It was in the marriage that we got to know each other.

0:04:55.280,0:05:00.020
When I got into his home, he would go to work,

0:05:00.020,0:05:04.200
and I was a housewife, I was at home.

0:05:04.200,0:05:08.140
I'll go through his computer, his laptop.

0:05:08.140,0:05:15.940
I discovered that there were so many pornographic pictures of ladies, naked women on it.

0:05:15.940,0:05:20.860
I became so jealous.

0:05:20.860,0:05:24.960
I wondered, why would my husband be watching other women when I'm here?

0:05:24.960,0:05:30.200
Even when I deleted those phonographic pictures, he would still put them back.

0:05:30.200,0:05:32.820
So that is how the anger started.

0:05:32.820,0:05:37.460
Instead of me to be more prayerful as a wife and not to keep offence

0:05:37.460,0:05:40.360
like the man of God always teaches,

0:05:40.360,0:05:47.120
I fought the battle physically, I would use a knife on him.

0:05:47.120,0:05:51.240
I did so many wrong things to my husband.

0:05:51.240,0:05:55.960
Okay, it is indeed a pathetic situation.

0:05:55.960,0:06:01.860
It's an experience in life and we thank God Almighty that the end result is a big testimony.

0:06:01.860,0:06:02.940
Okay.

0:06:02.940,0:06:09.420
Because of the anger, if you look at the body of my husband, you will see marks.

0:06:09.420,0:06:13.380
It pushed me to use knives on him.

0:06:13.380,0:06:16.020
There was one time I gave him a wound here,

0:06:16.020,0:06:18.900
that made him stay in the hospital for almost a month,

0:06:18.900,0:06:24.440
because the knife touched his vein and the bleeding was so much.

0:06:24.440,0:06:30.640
There was one time I chased him with a knife because I wanted to cut off his penis.

0:06:30.640,0:06:35.620
I held his penis and he had to run away from me.

0:06:35.620,0:06:45.100
He jumped from a two-storey building just to run away from me.

0:06:45.100,0:06:52.920
This anger made my husband not to come back home because he was scared of me.

0:06:52.920,0:06:55.880
He would not want to come back home.

0:06:55.880,0:06:58.600
Even till now, we don't sleep together.

0:06:58.600,0:07:01.300
He sleeps in his own room, and I sleep in mine.

0:07:01.300,0:07:05.420
He doesn't want to eat my food anymore.

0:07:05.420,0:07:07.380
So many things have happened, I offended him.

0:07:07.380,0:07:09.980
It made me to put him into so many debts

0:07:09.980,0:07:15.140
because all the houses we stayed in, they already knew us in Douala.

0:07:15.140,0:07:20.700
The fight was too much, every estate that we stayed in knew us.

0:07:20.700,0:07:28.020
I would fight to the extent where - if that anger did not see blood, it would not stop.

0:07:28.020,0:07:31.180
I broke people's properties.

0:07:31.180,0:07:35.100
They couldn't hold me accountable as a housewife so they would always hold him accountable.

0:07:35.100,0:07:40.820
All his salary would go towards paying people's houses, properties and debts.

0:07:40.820,0:07:43.760
I'm so sorry, my husband.

0:07:43.760,0:07:46.400
We know that indeed, you are so sorry because

0:07:46.400,0:07:50.700
that very demon that brought about the spirit of anger is out of your life.

0:07:50.700,0:07:53.200
But before you tell us your testimony and how you were delivered,

0:07:53.200,0:07:55.100
we still want to learn more from your life experience,

0:07:55.100,0:08:01.540
Can you tell us precisely how this spirit of anger actually affected your relationship with your children?

0:08:01.540,0:08:06.560
Yes, I have a three-year-old daughter.

0:08:06.560,0:08:11.940
One day she came to me in the morning because she eats a lot.

0:08:11.940,0:08:16.640
She came to me and was crying, "Mum, please, I'm hungry".

0:08:16.640,0:08:21.160
At that period I was so lonely.

0:08:21.160,0:08:24.280
I would lock myself up in the room and masturbate myself.

0:08:24.280,0:08:27.260
I would not even care if my children had eaten - nothing.

0:08:27.260,0:08:30.800
I would lock myself in. Sometimes I would come out of the room when it is already passed lunch.

0:08:30.800,0:08:33.240
I didn't care if my children had eaten.

0:08:33.240,0:08:36.860
So this small girl - this is her picture here -

0:08:36.860,0:08:40.380
she'll come crying to me, "Mummy, I'm hungry".

0:08:40.380,0:08:43.880
I would tell her, "Oh, go to your uncle" because I live with my junior brother.

0:08:43.880,0:08:46.400
I would say, "Go to your uncle for him to prepare something for you to eat".

0:08:46.400,0:08:47.740
She kept coming come to me.

0:08:47.740,0:08:51.500
That day - I had a huge mirror in my room -

0:08:51.500,0:08:59.480
she used her leg to hit the mirror and it got broken.

0:08:59.480,0:09:06.540
That anger just came upon me, and I beat up that child until I broke her leg.

0:09:06.540,0:09:08.540
How old was she then?

0:09:08.540,0:09:14.520
At that time she was I think two years old - yes, almost two.

0:09:14.520,0:09:17.520
She could not walk.

0:09:17.520,0:09:23.260
I saw that the problem was too much. It was controlling me.

0:09:23.260,0:09:30.400
Even this problem of lesbianism - it pushed me out to meet girls that were lesbians.

0:09:30.400,0:09:35.960
I didn't know but through their conversation they initiated me into lesbianism.

0:09:35.960,0:09:41.440
When one of them mentioned the name initiation, that's when the thought of it came.

0:09:41.440,0:09:46.220
I said to myself, "No, these people are going to initiate me", so I stopped going there.

0:09:46.220,0:09:51.180
But they kept coming to my home and in my dreams too, I would see myself with women.

0:09:51.180,0:09:55.060
So this also made me to lose the affection that I had for my husband.

0:09:55.060,0:09:58.980
When I saw women physically, I would start admiring women.

0:09:58.980,0:10:02.800
I no longer admired my husband.

0:10:02.800,0:10:10.180
So last week when the man of God touched me, that's when I started manifesting.

0:10:10.180,0:10:15.040
This anger started manifesting in me and it spoke all.

0:10:15.040,0:10:18.960
Now I'm delivered. That spirit is gone.

0:10:18.960,0:10:23.520
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:10:23.520,0:10:28.380
To God be the glory! Right now the spirit of anger is gone after the deliverance. Is that correct?

0:10:28.380,0:10:34.300
Yes, it's totally gone. Even the urge for masturbation, pornography is totally gone!

0:10:34.300,0:10:36.040
My dreams are free.

0:10:36.040,0:10:37.280
To God be the glory.

0:10:37.280,0:10:40.160
When the story of her pathetic situation was narrated to the man of God,

0:10:40.160,0:10:45.520
he went further to invite the husband and to the glory of God her husband is right here in our midst.

Mrs Tayim Anyaelle
Deliverance Testimony

0:10:58.900,0:11:02.740
Please, Man of God, help me to reconcile my marriage.

0:11:02.740,0:11:07.280
My husband said that this marriage is not from God and he is going to divorce me.

0:11:07.280,0:11:09.360
Please help me, Man of God.

0:11:09.360,0:11:13.140
Restore my marriage and bless it.

0:11:13.140,0:11:16.120
Please, Man of God, beg my husband for me to forgive me.

0:11:16.120,0:11:20.320
I didn't know what I was doing.

0:11:20.320,0:11:23.320
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:11:23.320,0:11:25.580
My name is Jude Tayim.

0:11:25.580,0:11:28.060
I come from Cameroon.

0:11:28.060,0:11:32.400
I am a Cameroonian by birth and nationality.

0:11:32.400,0:11:36.580
I got married to my wife about five years ago.

0:11:36.580,0:11:44.140
As she said, we met in September and got married in December that year.

0:11:44.140,0:11:48.960
So we never took time to get to know each other.

0:11:48.960,0:11:55.100
It is only when we were inside the marriage that we started to know the other's weaknesses.

0:11:55.100,0:12:02.320
Seriously, what I would like to say is that: If this is how marriage is like,

0:12:02.320,0:12:05.660
then I would advise no one to get married.

0:12:05.660,0:12:10.140
It's with respect to what I'm facing because the heat is extreme.

0:12:10.140,0:12:15.900
I don't think that anyone of you could accept to face that type of heat.

0:12:15.900,0:12:24.120
I will share with you today some bitter experiences that I've been facing.

0:12:24.120,0:12:30.440
I jumped from a storey building because I was running for my life

0:12:30.440,0:12:38.300
as my wife, out of anger, was chasing me with a knife in an attempt to kill me.

0:12:38.300,0:12:43.320
So I jumped from a storey building. I fell down and broke my leg.

0:12:43.320,0:12:47.400
I ran out of the house and stayed out for two weeks.

0:12:47.400,0:12:51.160
I came back later, thinking things had calmed.

0:12:51.160,0:12:55.620
At times, she got very annoyed.

0:12:55.620,0:12:59.540
Whenever I said anything, she would never agree with me.

0:12:59.540,0:13:03.160
She always wanted to command in the house.

0:13:03.160,0:13:11.080
Whenever she saw some funny videos on my phone or my computer,

0:13:11.080,0:13:16.320
it activated her anger, and she started fighting with me.

0:13:16.320,0:13:20.640
Whenever we fought, she always wanted to wound me.

0:13:20.640,0:13:27.780
When she did not find a weapon to wound me, she would use her teeth.

0:13:27.780,0:13:30.200
I have different marks on my arms.

0:13:30.200,0:13:31.700
Things like this.

0:13:31.700,0:13:37.260
Mr Jude Tayim
Shares Life Experience

0:13:37.260,0:13:42.460
I came back from work one day.

0:13:42.460,0:13:52.940
She started harassing me, asking why I was having pornographic videos on my phone.

0:13:52.940,0:13:57.320
I did not even have the time to explain why the videos were there.

0:13:57.320,0:14:00.680
So we started fighting and she took a knife.

0:14:00.680,0:14:08.860
She wanted to pierce me and I tried to block the knife. Then she cut my hand.

0:14:08.860,0:14:12.240
I went to the hospital and they sew it.

0:14:12.240,0:14:15.660
This other one here was a bottle.

0:14:15.660,0:14:23.660
She broke a bottle - a bottle of beer - and she pierced me with the bottle.

0:14:23.660,0:14:29.620
It affected my vein, and I lost so much blood.

0:14:29.620,0:14:35.680
I went to the hospital and I was admitted there for almost one month.

0:14:35.680,0:14:38.620
My condition was very extreme.

0:14:38.620,0:14:43.180
So this other one...

0:14:43.180,0:14:49.480
These marks are from different incidents. There are many of them.

0:14:49.480,0:14:53.820
This other one was also a bottle.

0:14:53.820,0:14:58.400
She broke a bottle and cut me with it everywhere.

0:14:58.400,0:15:09.240
I decided to separate my room from her because one day, when I was sleeping, I suddenly collapsed.

0:15:09.240,0:15:17.400
When I got up, I realized that whilst I had been sleeping, she had come with a weapon and hit me.

0:15:17.400,0:15:26.660
So I got up. It was her junior brother and my junior brother that came and tried to resuscitate me.

0:15:26.660,0:15:31.800
So I said to myself that I cannot live in this kind of condition because I don't know the future.

0:15:31.800,0:15:34.200
The future may be more dangerous than that.

0:15:34.200,0:15:38.100
So I decided that she should sleep in the matrimonial home,

0:15:38.100,0:15:41.780
and I would look for another room and sleep there.

0:15:41.780,0:15:44.860
Anytime I slept, I would lock the door.

0:15:44.860,0:15:47.320
I locked the door because I was afraid

0:15:47.320,0:15:52.820
that when a person would annoy her, she would pour her anger on me.

0:15:52.820,0:15:57.660
Another experience was that when I came back home one day,

0:15:57.660,0:16:03.460
I found my two-years-old daughter not walking.

0:16:03.460,0:16:07.860
Whenever I came back from work, she would say, "Daddy, Daddy" and would come and hug me.

0:16:07.860,0:16:10.400
But that day she did not come, she was very sad.

0:16:10.400,0:16:13.340
I asked, "What is happening with this baby?"

0:16:13.340,0:16:14.300
Thank you.

I know you have a lot to say.

0:16:24.580,0:16:30.140
I want to tell the viewers all over the world that I will not allow this family to go,

0:16:30.140,0:16:35.100
until we have reached an agreement with God.

0:16:43.120,0:16:44.680
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:16:44.680,0:16:47.840
My name is Mrs Tayim Anyaelle.

0:16:47.840,0:16:50.880
I'm from Douala, Cameroon.

0:16:50.880,0:16:56.960
The gentleman beside me is my lovely husband.

0:16:56.960,0:17:04.040
I came to The SCOAN with a problem of anger - severe anger.

0:17:04.040,0:17:12.320
This problem really cost me a lot because it affected my marriage and my relationship with my children.

0:17:12.320,0:17:17.860
It especially affected my marriage because the fights were too much with my husband.

0:17:17.860,0:17:27.240
All his body is full of marks because when I was angry, I would use a knife - sharp objects - to wound him.

0:17:27.240,0:17:35.440
I came to the church, and I was opportune to be placed on the prayer line.

0:17:35.440,0:17:44.660
When the man of God touched me, that spirit manifested and I was delivered by the grace of God.

0:17:44.660,0:17:50.900
The following week, after discussing with the man of God, he invited my husband over.

0:17:50.900,0:17:55.560
He also received deliverance.

0:17:55.560,0:17:59.540
I admit that I have been a bad partner,

0:17:59.540,0:18:02.660
and I thank God today that I am saved, delivered and happy.

0:18:02.660,0:18:05.120
The anger is gone. I am free.

0:18:05.120,0:18:10.520
When we met the man of God, he spoke to my husband and pleaded for me.

0:18:10.520,0:18:17.100
He told my husband that for us to enjoy light, we must experience darkness.

0:18:17.100,0:18:26.240
The devil fought us because there is joy ahead.

0:18:26.240,0:18:29.300
Because of that joy, that light that he had seen,

0:18:29.300,0:18:32.440
the devil always fought us because of our future.

0:18:32.440,0:18:37.620
He had seen the bright future, joy ahead. That is why he was fighting this marriage.

0:18:37.620,0:18:41.600
But by the grace of God, this marriage is from God.

0:18:41.600,0:18:45.940
We have reconciled. I love my husband very much.

0:18:45.940,0:18:49.000
I really want to begin by thanking the man of God

0:18:49.000,0:18:54.540
because ever since we've been here, he's been taking good care of us - my husband and I.

0:18:54.540,0:18:59.760
The teachings, the meditations and all the prayers - I really want to thank the man of God.

0:18:59.760,0:19:03.480
He's been taking care of us spiritually, physically, emotionally -

0:19:03.480,0:19:05.880
in every aspect we've been comfortable.

0:19:05.880,0:19:10.040
I've never felt at home in my whole life like I have felt here.

0:19:10.040,0:19:14.720
Indeed the teachings have taught me a lot in life.

0:19:14.720,0:19:18.680
So many things I did not know about Christianity.

0:19:18.680,0:19:22.580
I thought Christianity was just about going to church on Sundays,

0:19:22.580,0:19:25.340
and when you have time you read your Bible.

0:19:25.340,0:19:30.140
But now I know Christianity is when you build a relationship with God.

0:19:30.140,0:19:35.080
You cannot say you love your husband, or you love your children, if you don't love God

0:19:35.080,0:19:36.540
because true love comes from God.

0:19:36.540,0:19:40.600
It's that love that flows from God before you can extend it to your family.

0:19:40.600,0:19:47.180
So I have learnt a lot, and I see myself now as a wife.

0:19:47.180,0:19:50.580
I even pray for my husband - more than I pray for myself.

0:19:50.580,0:19:52.960
I pray for my children.

0:19:52.960,0:19:57.020
I thank God for the faith bracelet. It helps me to build my faith.

0:19:57.020,0:19:58.780
I always find myself praying more.

0:19:58.780,0:20:04.980
This is something that I've never really been doing before.

0:20:04.980,0:20:10.180
This is what I should have been doing - fighting spiritually.

0:20:10.180,0:20:14.600
Like what the man of God has been saying: Our battles are spiritual battles.

0:20:14.600,0:20:18.840
We cannot use the physical to fight the spiritual.

0:20:18.840,0:20:21.360
In terms of your relationship with your husband,

0:20:21.360,0:20:25.000
how have you been relating with him since your deliverance and the reconciliation?

0:20:25.000,0:20:32.380
Oh, it has really been good - peaceful. Now I understand him more.

0:20:32.380,0:20:38.020
Whenever I say something, all of a sudden I get conscious that it is wrong.

0:20:38.020,0:20:40.580
I say, "Oh baby, you know I love you, I am sorry".

0:20:40.580,0:20:43.460
Things have really been more calm.

0:20:43.460,0:20:49.500
The conversation flows. I tell him I love him every day, but before I didn't do that.

0:20:49.500,0:20:52.040
I now ask him in the morning, "Have you eaten?"

0:20:52.040,0:20:58.080
I sometimes even go to get his food - for lunch or breakfast.

0:20:58.080,0:21:00.760
I take care of him. I was never doing that before.

0:21:00.760,0:21:05.320
I did not even care when he came back from work or what time he came home.

0:21:05.320,0:21:08.060
Before, I would just lock myself up in the room.

0:21:08.060,0:21:12.680
My heart is full of joy and peace. I'm so happy being around here -

0:21:12.680,0:21:15.920
it's like Heaven on earth.

0:21:15.920,0:21:19.900
My name is Jude Tayim. I come from Cameroon.

0:21:19.900,0:21:24.760
The beautiful lady beside me is my lovely wife.

0:21:24.760,0:21:31.220
I came here last week on Sunday.

0:21:31.220,0:21:35.660
The man of God also prayed for me.

0:21:35.660,0:21:44.660
He said that many marriages have collapsed because the devil always fights people spiritually.

0:21:44.660,0:21:50.420
He said that the devil saw the greater joy ahead of us.

0:21:50.420,0:21:54.140
That is why the devil was trying to create all this destruction

0:21:54.140,0:22:02.080
so that we would not achieve that joy that God had destined for us.

0:22:02.080,0:22:07.880
That was his word. And he said that this marriage is a marriage from God.

0:22:07.880,0:22:12.460
I have witnessed many changes.

0:22:12.460,0:22:16.680
I did things deliberately just to see her reactions.

0:22:16.680,0:22:21.140
One of the things that I did on the first day:

0:22:21.140,0:22:25.660
I was poorly dressed and she asked me to go and dress up.

0:22:25.660,0:22:37.400
I said to myself, "This is an opportunity for me to see if this girl is really delivered from that spirit of anger".

0:22:37.400,0:22:42.160
So I refused to go and dress up.

0:22:42.160,0:22:45.400
I saw how she reacted: She ignored me.

0:22:45.400,0:22:50.340
I said to myself, "Oh, thank You, God", and I later went and changed.

0:22:50.340,0:22:57.180
Another experience I had was that she has been asking me to buy a Bible.

0:22:57.180,0:23:03.020
That I cannot grow in my spiritual life without having a Bible.

0:23:03.020,0:23:08.720
I know that what she said is a very good and wonderful idea.

0:23:08.720,0:23:13.120
I will not leave Nigeria without having a Bible.

0:23:13.120,0:23:17.660
But I told her that she should not disturb me with this issue of Bible.

0:23:17.660,0:23:21.420
That I will have the Bible at my own time.

0:23:21.420,0:23:28.160
I thought that that would make her mad but fortunately, she was still calm.

0:23:28.160,0:23:32.360
The things that before would have caused anger - you realized that she was just calm.

0:23:32.360,0:23:34.280
She was not reacting to what you were doing?

0:23:34.280,0:23:39.360
All those things that would previously activate her anger are deactivated.

0:23:39.360,0:23:45.380
Now she is controlled by another spirit - that is, the Holy Spirit -

0:23:45.380,0:23:51.920
thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua who came into our lives and intervened.

0:23:51.920,0:23:53.940
This is a wonderful marriage.

0:23:53.940,0:23:59.180
I just believe that we will achieve our goal as the man of God said.

0:23:59.180,0:24:03.600
We will live to see that happiness, and we will come back here for another greater testimony.

0:24:03.600,0:24:05.740
What I can say about myself is that:

0:24:05.740,0:24:14.240
I came here, and I had the spirit of watching too much pornography, that is lust.

0:24:14.240,0:24:18.680
Since the time the man of God laid his hand on me...

0:24:18.680,0:24:23.860
He was talking about how he will just give everybody a friendly tap.

0:24:23.860,0:24:29.260
But he arrived at my side and he gave me a touch:

0:24:29.260,0:24:35.460
My eyes became red as if I had just been smoking weed.

0:24:35.460,0:24:40.000
I tried to look at the man and thought he had hammered my head.

0:24:40.000,0:24:47.200
I said to myself, "That if that was just a simple touch, why am I feeling as if he had a metal in his hand?"

0:24:47.200,0:24:52.420
The next day, I decided to start browsing on my phone.

0:24:52.420,0:24:56.080
I went onto Facebook and the truth is that:

0:24:56.080,0:25:03.480
The things I saw then - a picture that was not good.

0:25:03.480,0:25:09.240
It was not really good for a Christian and automatically when I saw this picture,

0:25:09.240,0:25:16.960
there was an awareness in me and I received a revelation,

0:25:16.960,0:25:22.880
"That what you are about to watch is not in accordance with God's principles.

0:25:22.880,0:25:27.460
Do you accept or do you reject?" I just rejected it.

0:25:27.460,0:25:35.140
This really proved that the spirit that was pushing me into this thing,

0:25:35.140,0:25:41.920
that made me feel that watching this pornography was normal,

0:25:41.920,0:25:44.900
that spirit has left and I have regained consciousness.

0:25:44.900,0:25:46.520
I don't have any urge again.

0:25:46.520,0:25:54.280
I don't have any urge - neither to watch pornography nor lust for women.

0:25:54.280,0:26:00.220
For the few days that I have been here, I've learned so many things that I never knew about.

0:26:00.220,0:26:06.160
I thought Christianity was maybe just about reading the Bible - that was all.

0:26:06.160,0:26:11.100
But I never knew that Christianity is a lifestyle.

0:26:11.100,0:26:21.640
What I can advise the viewers all over the world is that we should always have our Holy Bible with us.

0:26:21.640,0:26:25.900
And as the man of God says, the Holy Bible is not that book that we carry.

0:26:25.900,0:26:31.860
The Holy Bible is that scripture that we read and we make it an integral part of us.

0:26:31.860,0:26:36.400
We read, swallow and digest it into our system - our spiritual system.

0:26:36.400,0:26:43.660
So that at any moment in our life when we are faced with any form of temptation,

0:26:43.660,0:26:49.860
the words can easily flow out from our hearts.

0:26:49.860,0:26:54.480
So we should make God's Word the standard for our life.

0:26:54.480,0:27:01.700
My encouragement to all Emmanuel viewers, both here and outside in the whole world,

0:27:01.700,0:27:07.120
is that indeed, marriage is not a bed of roses.

0:27:07.120,0:27:09.180
Like Prophet T.B. Joshua always says:

0:27:09.180,0:27:12.860
It is two imperfect people who have come together to create a union.

0:27:12.860,0:27:16.960
We need to understand each other more and be more patient.

0:27:16.960,0:27:21.360
And like my husband has said: Make the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:27:21.360,0:27:29.020
I also want to advise women - mothers and married women:

0:27:29.020,0:27:35.580
When you get into marriage, don't think that the devil will just let you enjoy it -

0:27:35.580,0:27:39.080
that every day, there will just be roses and honeymoon.

0:27:39.080,0:27:41.440
Indeed, there will be certain challenges.

0:27:41.440,0:27:46.960
But instead of fighting them physically - like what I did, the mistake I did -

0:27:46.960,0:27:55.760
it is preferable and even the best way to go down on your knees - like the teachings I got here -

0:27:55.760,0:28:00.380
go into your room and fight all your battles on your knees.

0:28:00.380,0:28:03.120
Pray for your husband, pray for your children,

0:28:03.120,0:28:11.840
and avoid friends outside, friends who add nothing to your life but instead divide and subtract.

0:28:11.840,0:28:16.160
We pray that God will give both of you the grace to maintain what you have received here

0:28:16.160,0:28:18.720
by making the Word of God the standard for your life.

0:28:18.720,0:28:22.900
We believe as you do say, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:28:22.900,0:28:25.760
Thank You, Jesus.
