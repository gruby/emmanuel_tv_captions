Wise man Daniel moves through the congregation praying for the people in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:00:12.340,0:00:18.700
As he ministers the prayer to the people every garment of darkness in their lives are removed in Jesus' name.

0:00:18.730,0:00:24.000
Jesus came to preserve us, to heal us, to deliver us and save us.

0:00:24.070,0:00:29.100
Get ready to see and understand that there is more to life than meets the ordinary eye,

0:00:29.109,0:00:36.300
as you watch wise man Daniel's encounter with this man.

0:00:36.399,0:00:38.600
Who are you?

0:00:38.680,0:00:39.781
Chief priest.

0:00:39.781,0:00:40.281
Chief priest?

0:00:40.281,0:00:41.249
Yes.

0:00:41.250,0:00:43.100
What have you done to him?

0:00:43.100,0:00:44.600
Destroyed him.

0:00:44.600,0:00:45.100
Destroyed him?

0:00:45.100,0:00:46.000
Yes.

0:00:46.000,0:00:47.300
Can you explain how you destroyed him?

0:00:47.300,0:00:51.100
We've ruined his business. We've ruined his marriage.

0:00:51.190,0:00:54.900
We've just finished him. By the way, he's supposed to die today.

0:00:54.969,0:00:56.969
He's supposed to...

0:00:56.969,0:00:59.400
Die today.

0:00:59.410,0:01:02.400
Why is he here? We have an arrangement here.

0:01:02.400,0:01:02.900
Speak louder!

0:01:02.900,0:01:07.700
I'm speaking. I'm chief priest, okay?

0:01:07.750,0:01:09.900
He's supposed to come home today.

0:01:09.900,0:01:12.420
You're a chief priest?

0:01:12.420,0:01:12.920
Yes.

0:01:12.920,0:01:13.900
What have you done to the family?

0:01:13.990,0:01:18.200
We destroyed their businesses, there's no progress there.

0:01:18.280,0:01:20.077
What have you done to the marriage?

0:01:20.077,0:01:23.200
I sent the wife away with the daughter.

0:01:23.200,0:01:25.200
You sent the wife away with the daughter.

0:01:25.200,0:01:27.300
Yes.

0:01:27.310,0:01:35.000
And people that owe him... We removed his memory and he doesn't remember.

0:01:35.079,0:01:40.700
So those who owe him - you have removed his memory so he's not able to remember those who are owing him.

0:01:40.720,0:01:41.220
Yes.

0:01:41.220,0:01:43.500
Why did you do that?

0:01:43.509,0:01:50.700
Oh! He's a bit smart. So we have to be taking his memory as he ages, you know.

0:01:50.799,0:01:58.800
So every year we remove a 12 months memory capacity from his brain.

0:01:58.810,0:02:00.070
Why?

0:02:00.070,0:02:02.500
We need to slow him down.

0:02:02.560,0:02:06.300
What kind of business does he do? What kind of business do you destroy?

0:02:06.369,0:02:14.000
He has a good big supermarket, a popular supermarket. We destroyed it.

0:02:14.020,0:02:19.300
He has a good pharmacy, a household pharmacy.

0:02:19.330,0:02:24.700
We just finished it. By the way, if he thinks to continue to run that business,

0:02:24.790,0:02:29.600
if he's not going to die, we will send him to prison

0:02:29.600,0:02:36.700
for still trying to overturn our decision. But anyway - he's supposed to die.

0:02:36.790,0:02:39.000
When is he supposed to die?

0:02:39.010,0:02:45.000
He's supposed to die today. It is the birthday of his daughter.

0:02:45.010,0:02:47.010
Birthday of his daughter.

0:02:47.680,0:02:50.600
So he has to celebrate her birthday over there

0:02:50.650,0:02:54.300
while we watch what happens.

0:02:54.310,0:03:00.600
He supposed to commit suicide that's why we brought him home. We didn't want him to come in cargo.

0:03:00.670,0:03:02.299
Where was he living before?

0:03:02.299,0:03:04.800
He stays in Botswana.

0:03:04.810,0:03:07.000
And you brought him home?

0:03:07.000,0:03:08.000
Yes.

0:03:08.000,0:03:10.520
Why did you bring him home? Why?

0:03:10.520,0:03:14.200
We don't want him to come in cargo. We want him to die at home

0:03:14.260,0:03:17.449
because we need fresh blood. I've got to go.

0:03:17.449,0:03:18.487
You've got to go.

0:03:18.487,0:03:19.769
I've got to go.

0:03:19.769,0:03:23.608
Okay, you say he's supposed to die today. Why did you allow him to come in here?

0:03:23.609,0:03:27.400
See, I don't know. I think he tricked us. That's another thing.

0:03:27.430,0:03:29.000
He plays smart.

0:03:29.000,0:03:30.500
He plays smart?

0:03:30.500,0:03:32.900
He agreed he is coming home to die.

0:03:32.980,0:03:39.100
When he got to Lagos he got stick in Lagos. He is supposed to be in the village by now

0:03:39.190,0:03:40.957
but he keeps on playing the game.

0:03:40.957,0:03:46.000
Okay, and he's finally here. Do you know where he is now?

0:03:46.090,0:03:48.700
This place...

0:03:48.790,0:03:49.920
It's not good for us.

0:03:49.920,0:03:51.945
This place is not good for you people?

0:03:51.945,0:03:56.400
It's not good for us.

0:03:56.430,0:03:59.820
Why do you say this place is not good for you, people?

0:03:59.820,0:04:08.900
It's a one way house. When you come in,  you don't come out.

0:04:08.980,0:04:11.920
Why did you say, it's a place you come in - you don't go out? Why?

0:04:11.920,0:04:20.700
We can only see footsteps coming in. Where did you send them?

0:04:20.709,0:04:24.700
Okay, who are the people that come in and cannot go out? Who are the people?

0:04:24.700,0:04:32.100
All the mermaids and kings and queens of the world under the ground.

0:04:32.169,0:04:34.993
All the mermaids and kings and queens  of the underworld.

0:04:34.993,0:04:35.600
Yes.

0:04:35.600,0:04:38.285
When they come in, they don't go out.

0:04:38.285,0:04:42.100
Yes. Where do you keep them? Just let's have an agreement.

0:04:42.160,0:04:46.600
Let's have an understanding. Let me just go, okay?

0:04:46.620,0:04:50.000
Okay, why did you say, when they come in here, they don't go out? What is wrong?

0:04:50.000,0:04:55.500
That's the strange thing about this house.

0:04:55.539,0:05:01.400
That's the strange thing about this house, but one day we're going to find out.

0:05:01.449,0:05:03.210
There must be a way out.

0:05:03.210,0:05:06.475
Okay, now you've come here? Are you sure, you're still going back?

0:05:06.475,0:05:09.389
For me? That's why I said let's have a gentleman's agreement, okay?

0:05:09.389,0:05:11.958
We'll leave him to you.

0:05:11.958,0:05:12.458
Huh?

0:05:12.458,0:05:14.400
It's okay.

0:05:14.470,0:05:19.500
Okay. The same thing that has happened to other mermaids and evil spirits, will happen to you now.

0:05:19.500,0:05:28.600
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus! Come here!

0:05:28.659,0:05:33.200
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:33.250,0:05:36.000
Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:36.099,0:05:41.759
You wicked chief priest - out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:05:41.759,0:05:44.300
Fire all over your body! Fire!

0:05:44.340,0:05:48.400
Oh!

0:05:48.490,0:05:52.300
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:52.360,0:05:56.700
Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:56.770,0:06:05.900
You wicked chief priest - out, in the mighty name of Jesus! In Jesus' mighty name!

0:06:05.920,0:06:14.300
You're free. Rise up!

0:06:14.350,0:06:18.200
How are you, sir?

0:06:18.220,0:06:19.286
I'm fine.

0:06:19.286,0:06:23.200
Huh? How are you?

0:06:23.290,0:06:24.658
How are you, sir?

0:06:24.658,0:06:25.417
I'm fine.

0:06:25.417,0:06:28.100
What are you doing here?

0:06:28.180,0:06:31.000
I'm just wondering.

0:06:31.000,0:06:33.300
You said?..

0:06:33.310,0:06:36.329
What happened to you? You just stood up from the floor. What happened to you?

0:06:36.329,0:06:43.000
Shame! Oh, shame!

0:06:43.000,0:06:44.300
How?

0:06:44.300,0:06:50.100
What happened to you? You don't know what happened to you?

0:06:50.100,0:06:54.400
You mean...

0:06:54.400,0:06:56.400
Where were you sitting before?

0:06:56.400,0:06:57.400
I was sitting down there.

0:06:57.400,0:07:01.500
Then what happened to you? Why are you here?

0:07:01.570,0:07:06.400
Okay, you said you are the chief priest in the body.

0:07:06.460,0:07:08.300
Priest?

0:07:08.300,0:07:11.400
Not only priest - chief priest in the body.

0:07:11.440,0:07:12.700
No.

0:07:12.700,0:07:14.240
You said so now.

0:07:14.240,0:07:15.700
I'm not a priest.

0:07:15.700,0:07:19.800
You said you're out to destroy this body and the entire family.

0:07:19.800,0:07:23.470
Oh God! How?..

0:07:23.470,0:07:25.500
You just said it now - you.

0:07:25.570,0:07:27.280
Okay.

0:07:27.280,0:07:28.920
You also you said he was in Botswana

0:07:28.920,0:07:30.900
and you brought him back, that he's to die today.

0:07:30.900,0:07:34.800
Today is the birthday of the daughter and you are meant to die today.

0:07:34.810,0:07:36.920
Yes, I stay in Botswana.

0:07:36.920,0:07:38.500
But you said you brought him back to kill him.

0:07:38.560,0:07:41.020
No, I just came on my own.

0:07:41.020,0:07:43.500
You said you brought him to kill him, that today is the birthday of the daughter.

0:07:43.510,0:07:45.700
When is the birthday of your daughter?

0:07:45.700,0:07:48.300
Today.

0:07:48.300,0:07:52.300
You said you want to kill him.

0:07:52.350,0:07:56.000
You destroyed all his businesses. He has a pharmaceutical company, you destroyed it.

0:07:56.039,0:07:57.382
You didn't say that?

0:07:57.382,0:08:03.100
No, my business is having problems, but I can't destroy what I'm building up.

0:08:03.150,0:08:05.150
Okay, you are delivered, sir. You are free.

0:08:05.150,0:08:07.940
Thank you. Thank You, Jesus, I'm free.

0:08:38.070,0:08:42.000
Thank you, so you have listened to everything.

0:08:42.060,0:08:44.700
You listened to what has happened?

0:08:44.790,0:08:49.800
He received a phone call, he never believed this can happen.

0:08:49.830,0:08:54.400
But everything he said in the spirit

0:08:54.420,0:09:00.000
reflects what has happened to him in the physical world.

0:09:00.000,0:09:02.200
Now he's here today.

0:09:02.220,0:09:07.700
Now let us see everything he said. He's now going to take it one by one.

0:09:07.700,0:09:11.400
Because he didn't know what he was saying. But all what he said -

0:09:11.400,0:09:15.500
is actually what was happenning in his life.

0:09:15.570,0:09:18.399
So tell me now what was happening in your life.

0:09:18.399,0:09:21.409
If I call my father here to explain what is happening in his life,

0:09:21.410,0:09:30.000
you will see that those things can not just come from Heaven - it's from pit of hell.

0:09:30.089,0:09:36.900
If those things are from pit of hell, it means definitely you're possesed.

0:09:36.990,0:09:40.800
And to go straight to the root of your problem is to deliver you from the demon.

0:09:40.800,0:09:42.650
If you are not delivered from the demon

0:09:42.650,0:09:47.500
and you are healed - then we are just joking. Let me tell you something.

0:09:47.500,0:09:54.000
If the demon is inside person, and the person is healed -

0:09:54.089,0:10:00.100
now it's like a man who has gonorrhea,

0:10:00.149,0:10:06.289
but as a result the wife also has gonorrhea. But the husband comes here, "Sir, I have gonorrhea, heal me".

0:10:06.290,0:10:13.500
If the man is healed of that gonorrhea, you know, he will still go and meet the wife that has that gonorrhea at home.

0:10:13.529,0:10:17.900
And the moment he meets that woman for affection,

0:10:17.939,0:10:21.400
he will contact another gonorrhea.

0:10:21.449,0:10:23.900
This gonorrhea will not go permanently,

0:10:23.939,0:10:28.200
unless the same woman is also delivered from the gonorrhea.

0:10:28.259,0:10:32.800
If the woman is healed of gonorrhea, and the man is healed of gonorrhea - the gonorrhea is gone.

0:10:32.850,0:10:37.200
But if one of them is healed of gonorrhea - we are just playing around.

0:10:37.259,0:10:44.300
Can you see the reason why our problem continues to persist?

0:10:44.310,0:10:51.800
Imagine, you say you have limitation, problem in your business, you rise to a big position...

0:10:51.870,0:10:56.300
You were prayed for and you rise to a big position... Suddenly you - mmm!..

0:10:56.370,0:10:58.230
Backwards!

0:10:58.230,0:11:03.500
It means we have not touched the root of your problem.

0:11:03.509,0:11:06.000
It's, "Poverty! Poverty!"

0:11:06.029,0:11:07.019
We pray for you -

0:11:07.019,0:11:11.900
and you are blessed, and you get there! Suddenly the whole thing disappears again.

0:11:11.900,0:11:19.400
It means something is in you, that will just strike anytime you want to strike.

0:11:19.410,0:11:24.300
It will just fold hands. It will allow you to continue to enjoy.

0:11:24.300,0:11:29.800
At the time you need that enjoyment most, it will destroy it.

0:11:29.880,0:11:37.900
That everything is smooth - it is too early for you to say,

0:11:37.920,0:11:46.300
"I'm okay, now". It's too early. Are you sure that old man is delivered?

0:11:46.370,0:11:50.900
Are you with me? If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand!

0:11:50.910,0:11:54.200
Can you see the root of your problem?

0:11:54.360,0:11:58.300
I want you to listen to our brother. You'll learn a lot of lessons today.

0:11:58.319,0:12:06.200
We want our brother to tell us, please. Open up, please. With you word - a lot of people will be delivered.

0:12:06.209,0:12:08.700
So please, don't be selfish.

0:12:08.790,0:12:12.980
To be selfish is not to open up. Now you are delivered.

0:12:12.980,0:12:16.501
And you want this deliverance to affect many people positively.

0:12:16.501,0:12:21.300
A lot of people - million people, trillion people are watching this program.

0:12:21.360,0:12:25.279
So for them to be delivered too - it's a big promotion for you.

0:12:25.279,0:12:32.500
I want you to open up. Don't be selfish. Open up, tell us everything what has happened. Thank you.

0:12:32.579,0:12:48.500
Your name, your profession, your spiritual life. Are you a Christian? Who are you? Listen.

0:12:48.500,0:12:52.559
Viewers all over the world, please, watch and learn:

0:12:52.559,0:13:01.000
the experiences and what you are about to hear is greater than miracle.

0:13:01.000,0:13:03.200
Why is it greater than miracle?

0:13:03.220,0:13:07.500
Because it will help you to maintain miracle.

0:13:07.540,0:13:12.500
And what helps you to maintain something you have is greater than that something you have.

0:13:12.550,0:13:13.690
Do you know,

0:13:13.690,0:13:20.000
maintaince is salvation and salvation is maintainance. If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.

0:13:20.080,0:13:32.300
Tell your neighbour, "Maintenance is salvation, salvation is maintainance".

0:13:32.300,0:13:43.000
Emmanuel! My name is Ignatius DJ. I'm Nigerian but I stay in Botswana.

0:13:43.000,0:13:50.500
I was here last Monday service and what I experienced was quite strange to me.

0:13:50.500,0:13:58.400
As you saw in the clips, when the wise man Daniel was passing and laying hands,

0:13:58.420,0:14:06.800
I found out that just in a second I could not understand myself, the next second I came to my senses, the next second I didn't understand.

0:14:06.820,0:14:13.500
But after the deliverance when they put back to me what I said,

0:14:13.510,0:14:20.200
even they wrote it down for me, and I listened and I saw the clips again -

0:14:20.200,0:14:24.700
I was more confused as to what had really happened.

0:14:24.700,0:14:30.600
But I must say between then and now I've been trying to figure out

0:14:30.670,0:14:37.900
how all these things started, how it relates to my life because I consider myself a Christian

0:14:37.930,0:14:46.900
and active Christian for that matter. I do pray, I do counsil others as a service to my church.

0:14:46.990,0:14:49.300
I hold responsibilities, I advise people.

0:14:49.360,0:14:59.100
Sure, I'm an elder in the church. And when this happened I tried to reflect on my Christian life

0:14:59.110,0:15:05.800
as to what I had been doing before and how this spirit had been in me.

0:15:05.830,0:15:10.900
Then when I looked at my life, I found out I had problems

0:15:10.930,0:15:17.400
but a problem of inconsistency in activities in relationship even now

0:15:17.470,0:15:22.400
business relationships, fellow male to male relationships and just like that.

0:15:22.420,0:15:31.700
But I would say the greatest point where my spiritual entanglement in my physical life manifested -

0:15:31.700,0:15:36.100
is in my marital life.

0:15:36.100,0:15:40.529
In Botswana, I run a pharmacy business but I'm not a pharmacist by profession.

0:15:40.530,0:15:47.400
I do hire a pharmacists, but just like any other stuff I employ, they hardly stay with me.

0:15:47.400,0:15:51.000
People you employ today - tomorrow they leave your employment.

0:15:51.010,0:15:54.689
In the midst of trying to save my business,

0:15:54.690,0:15:59.700
I was not yet married then, and I decided if I got married to a pharmacist,

0:15:59.740,0:16:03.500
it would do me good and help me to run our business as a family.

0:16:03.500,0:16:12.700
With that thought, I sent word to my people that I needed a wife on the condition that she would be a pharmacist,

0:16:12.700,0:16:20.700
so that we can be able to run our business together. And that was done in 2006.

0:16:20.710,0:16:26.200
It is a tradition in our place, if you are far away abroad

0:16:26.260,0:16:31.700
and you need to get married, your people arrange for the marriage. They will get you a wife by сommunication,

0:16:31.780,0:16:39.300
you see pictures and you feel it's okay. You come home and get married. So that happened to me in 2006.

0:16:39.340,0:16:45.629
Precisely, December 17, 2006 I came down from Botswana and by 23rd of December I was in the church.

0:16:45.630,0:16:49.500
I wedded to my wife and I went back to my business place.

0:16:49.540,0:16:53.900
We never courted before, we never met before our marriage.

0:16:53.950,0:17:03.900
Two years later after her school she joined me and that was where my problem of inconsistency in relationship started -

0:17:03.910,0:17:09.400
on the very day I picked my wife from the airport.

0:17:09.490,0:17:15.400
In fact, it all started as I picked my wife from the airport.  We were coming home,

0:17:15.400,0:17:21.400
and there wasn't any chat of excitement or just being happy picking your wife.

0:17:21.400,0:17:25.900
It is more of as if I was just a driver sent to pick up somebody

0:17:25.900,0:17:32.300
and I was just concerned driving and my head was just asking like, "What am I doing?"

0:17:32.330,0:17:37.200
By the time we got home I never felt any affection for my wife.

0:17:37.200,0:17:42.900
In fact, I just started seeing her as a neighbour roommate with me.

0:17:42.919,0:17:50.000
And that really caused a very big strain, that even to the stage I was even asking for a miracle for me

0:17:50.000,0:17:55.900
to realize that I'm with my wife - not just another man in the house.

0:17:55.909,0:18:01.059
To the lady... She was really going through hell.

0:18:01.070,0:18:07.240
But nevertheless, I was in a different world of my own. All my concern was to wake up in the morning,

0:18:07.240,0:18:12.039
go to my business and come back in the night. And even at night when I was coming back,

0:18:12.039,0:18:16.900
when I remembered that I was going back home to this woman -

0:18:16.900,0:18:22.800
I would rather prefer to spend more time outside before going home.

0:18:22.800,0:18:28.600
Eventually we managed to make do and she became pregnant.

0:18:28.610,0:18:36.100
But by the time she was four months pregnant, I could no longer manage that.

0:18:36.110,0:18:40.200
Fortunately enough she has her family away in the United States,

0:18:40.200,0:18:48.900
and I arranged and sent her to one of her sisters on the basis that she would have a baby in the United States.

0:18:48.950,0:18:51.500
As if to say that was my wish.

0:18:51.590,0:18:57.300
But actually it wasn't my wish, it was a way of seeing her out of my life.

0:18:57.350,0:19:05.400
So all the time when she was away in the United States for her pregnancy,

0:19:05.400,0:19:09.400
I was hopeful and wishing that she will change her mind never to come back to me.

0:19:09.470,0:19:19.500
Because I just felt that she was a problem to me and not really a wife.

0:19:19.580,0:19:24.100
Fortunately or unfortunately she had a baby and I wasn't excited.

0:19:24.110,0:19:30.500
After six months by persuasion, I agreed she will come back.

0:19:30.500,0:19:36.000
And when she came back with the baby, after six months I just like before went to the airport.

0:19:36.000,0:19:40.369
I first of all took enough time to attend  to my bussiness,

0:19:40.370,0:19:42.600
and they were waiting for me at the airport.

0:19:42.630,0:19:45.200
When I picked her up at the airport,

0:19:45.299,0:19:49.900
it was like if I have known I would have arranged a hotel where I would put them,

0:19:49.980,0:19:54.800
instead of taking them to my house.

0:19:54.809,0:19:59.000
Eventually we came home. I think they came home on Wednesday

0:19:59.039,0:20:05.400
and by Friday I put them back on a flight to Nigeria.

0:20:05.429,0:20:15.200
By the time they left, my goodness, all I was just doing

0:20:15.299,0:20:22.400
was using every means so that she would call it a day.

0:20:22.409,0:20:27.600
If I was busy at work or even if I was happy and my phone rang,

0:20:27.630,0:20:32.000
once I picked up the phone and it was my wife, - I became annoyed.

0:20:32.070,0:20:37.200
This continued, and I felt that "No, I don't want this marriage",

0:20:37.250,0:20:42.400
I would rather sacrifice everything for me to walk out of this marriage.

0:20:42.400,0:20:46.169
This was happening in 2009.

0:20:46.169,0:20:57.600
Between 2009 and now...

0:21:00.600,0:21:03.814
Between 2009 and now I was just going out there looking for...

0:21:03.814,0:21:11.000
I was no longer looking for wife these days. All I wanted was just to have children here and there.

0:21:11.059,0:21:17.209
l felt that because in the society now people make do with single parenthood,

0:21:17.210,0:21:21.829
I could always take care of the children, without putting a wife into my house.

0:21:21.830,0:21:29.000
And this happened that I am telling you as I'm standing here now.

0:21:29.039,0:21:34.200
I have four kids and my wife is not aware of this incident.

0:21:34.200,0:21:38.800
And these four kids - just one is from my marriage.

0:21:38.800,0:21:43.600
Three kids outside my marriage with three different wives,

0:21:43.650,0:21:46.000
three different women.

0:21:46.040,0:21:52.100
This thing is just by each one as if it is in program of their activity.

0:21:52.170,0:21:57.100
I will just be there and this thing just keeps happening.

0:21:57.120,0:22:03.600
In my head, I didn't even have the cause to talk to anybody.

0:22:03.600,0:22:09.500
There was something I discuss it in my head, and it just keeped on telling me, "No. This is okay. This is okay".

0:22:09.590,0:22:15.100
I found myself the principles I learned from childhood being turned overnight

0:22:15.120,0:22:18.600
into what I was just seeing in the present days with my eyes

0:22:18.690,0:22:23.000
just believing what my eyes saw and no longer what I had in my head.

0:22:23.000,0:22:27.800
As if to say my head didn't belong to me.

0:22:27.810,0:22:33.600
At this point in time, it is actually true it was the frustration in my business

0:22:33.600,0:22:37.400
that really brought down all the memories of everything.

0:22:37.440,0:22:40.159
Since these few days of my deliverance

0:22:40.160,0:22:44.100
I feel very much ashamed of all I have done.

0:22:44.190,0:22:49.300
All I have been praying is that it is only man of God that can help me

0:22:49.380,0:22:54.100
first and foremost in history to reconcile me with my family.

0:22:54.120,0:22:58.500
Of everything I have I will let go.

0:22:58.590,0:23:04.700
Of everything I have in life I can let go before my wife and my daughter -

0:23:04.740,0:23:12.100
I am pleading with the man of God, please help me recover my family first,

0:23:12.120,0:23:14.120
my family, my daughter.

0:23:14.120,0:23:20.300
It's just now that we meet here at  the Synagogue, Church of Nations.

0:23:20.370,0:23:22.400
You listen to that?

0:23:22.470,0:23:26.800
I cannot continue listen to this, it is very touching. He's crying.

0:23:26.850,0:23:31.200
He says it was like his head was no longer his own head.

0:23:31.290,0:23:34.500
He had different women outside,

0:23:34.530,0:23:38.800
different children - each child for each woman.

0:23:38.850,0:23:43.900
It's like this head was no longer his head, he just continued to do the other thing.

0:23:43.920,0:23:49.700
After that deliverance on Sunday, and we now called him, all what he said.

0:23:49.700,0:23:53.500
He started telling all what happened.

0:23:53.570,0:23:59.100
Immediately we asked for the wife's number and I called the woman.

0:23:59.100,0:24:11.600
For so long  he has been separated with the dear woman and the woman having heard our voice - she came down.

0:24:11.659,0:24:18.248
I want to see the woman, please.

0:24:18.248,0:25:42.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:42.710,0:25:45.400
Well.

0:25:45.409,0:25:51.600
I'm just seeing her for the first time. Face to face.

0:25:51.679,0:25:57.400
Because I was very busy for the past... It's alright, don't worry. She wants to clean your eyes.

0:25:57.400,0:26:12.100
Please, let her clean your eyes. Have it, little one. You can use it to clean your mum's...

0:26:12.100,0:26:13.929
Okay, it's alright.

0:26:13.929,0:26:19.900
Since past Sunday now I've been very busy

0:26:19.960,0:26:25.020
but just hearing 'TB Joshua', 'The Synagogue' the woman said - whatever the case he handles -

0:26:25.020,0:26:33.300
she cannot disobey the man of God,  she has to come and explain herself. That is why she's here today.

0:26:33.399,0:26:41.300
You know, we are not going to deceive her, we'll tell her the mind of God.

0:26:41.380,0:26:47.200
She is a Christian. She realized that in every situation God has something to say.

0:26:47.200,0:26:49.409
"Let me hear what this man, what God said to this man?"

0:26:49.409,0:26:53.759
That's why she is here. She is not here to meet the man here. But she is here,

0:26:53.760,0:26:59.729
"I want to hear what God is talking, is speaking to this man. What message God has given to this man for me?"

0:26:59.760,0:27:07.500
That's why she's here. She's not here to meet our father here, but she is here to hear what does God say,

0:27:07.570,0:27:14.700
what message this man has for me. That's why she's here, and this is a beautiful lady I see.

0:27:14.740,0:27:18.600
Look at the little girl looking like father as well.

0:27:18.640,0:27:25.600
Okay, so now you have seen what's happened.

0:27:25.600,0:27:28.300
Okay.

0:27:28.389,0:27:33.900
You have seen the woman is really crying, you have seen what happened.

0:27:33.900,0:27:38.700
It's never his will, this is work of satan.

0:27:38.769,0:27:42.300
Satan just wanted to destroy the house

0:27:42.370,0:27:49.200
but today we thank God we are able to live to see today.

0:27:49.269,0:27:55.200
Look at what happened today and your husband was not here. He was here

0:27:55.269,0:28:03.600
to ask God to bless his business, but suddenly the Lord went straight to the root of the problem.

0:28:03.669,0:28:04.809
Suddenly.

0:28:04.809,0:28:10.100
Just like today by the time we lay hand on you because it's not yet time now to do that

0:28:10.179,0:28:17.100
when we are here for reconciliation. By the time we lay hand on you and whatever inside of you also will begin to speak.

0:28:17.169,0:28:20.900
This is why everyone of us is here today.

0:28:20.980,0:28:30.200
I really want to salute you.

0:28:30.279,0:28:34.349
Because you knew the time like this is coming

0:28:34.350,0:28:38.661
that is why you have been waiting for time like this.

0:28:38.661,0:28:41.700
If not - you would have messed up your life.

0:28:41.740,0:28:46.700
But today you refused to mess up your life, you waited for time like this.

0:28:46.750,0:28:51.400
She refused to mess up her life. Assume she has messed up her life now -

0:28:51.490,0:28:56.840
no more reconciliation. Time like this -

0:28:56.840,0:29:02.400
we could not call her to come here. In fact, she would say, "Man of God, I need to ask permission from sososo person",

0:29:02.409,0:29:07.200
which I would not even allow her to come here.

0:29:07.210,0:29:14.100
But today because she knew that the time like this is coming, she knew satan is a lier,

0:29:14.159,0:29:22.500
she has been waiting for the time like this - now the time has come.

0:29:22.500,0:29:30.700
So I really want to salute you and to say, "God, what a wonderful woman is this!" Look at my little one.

0:29:30.720,0:29:42.100
The little one does not even know the father. Who is that?

0:29:42.159,0:29:50.500
Okay. Wait, I'm coming. I want to do... For you to know, satan is a lier.

0:29:50.529,0:29:54.600
Look at him!

0:29:54.609,0:30:04.100
Who's is it? Who is it?

0:30:04.179,0:30:09.388
It's daddy. Baby, say, it's daddy!

0:30:09.388,0:30:14.500
It's daddy.

0:30:14.559,0:30:18.718
I'm very sorry, help me plead with my wife to forgive me. I'm very sorry!

0:30:18.729,0:30:20.559
I'm very sorry, please.

0:30:20.559,0:30:25.949
Look, you know we thank God for what God has done even if you walk on your knee to your wife,

0:30:25.950,0:30:29.300
it's not too bad. Can you walk on your on your knees now and let me go there.

0:30:29.349,0:30:38.300
Give me my little one.

0:30:38.379,0:30:42.800
Because it's not even enough to pay the price.

0:30:42.849,0:30:46.619
The price is too heavy.

0:30:46.629,0:30:51.149
We know, it's not you that has been doing this. It's satan. You have to walk on your knees.

0:30:51.149,0:31:08.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:08.409,0:31:12.700
I'm so sorry.

0:31:12.700,0:31:18.300
I'm so sorry. I was confused. It wasn't me, it would not happen again.

0:31:18.309,0:31:19.479
Please.

0:31:19.479,0:31:25.200
Come home. Don't talk of the future now, talk of now.

0:31:25.210,0:31:28.900
Because if you now talk of the future, you are confusing the whole thing.

0:31:28.960,0:31:35.300
Talk of what happened now. "It won't happen again. I am so sorry!"

0:31:35.349,0:31:39.500
Please, I'm so sorry, forgive me, please.

0:31:39.580,0:31:46.400
Listen to that. We are not fighting the flesh and blood, it means our husband is not our enemy,

0:31:46.450,0:31:51.700
our wife is not our enemy, our children are not our enemies

0:31:51.790,0:31:57.100
but spirit being. It is not this flesh, the appearance you are seeing,

0:31:57.160,0:32:00.400
that is fighting you, that is destroying the marriage.

0:32:00.400,0:32:08.100
It's not this appearance you are looking at that we are fighting, but  spirit being, the devil.

0:32:08.170,0:32:12.100
So please.

0:32:12.160,0:32:15.900
I want to join your family.

0:32:15.910,0:32:17.910
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

0:33:37.649,0:33:44.100
Reconciled In Jesus' Name

Madam, come. I think once and for all - because

0:33:48.280,0:33:54.100
when you are coming next week is thanksgiving, but it's better I should speak my mind now.

0:33:54.130,0:33:57.400
So what God deposited in my heart.

0:33:57.460,0:34:06.300
Look, you are mother, you are everything. I'm going to join you in this battle. I'm going to join this family.

0:34:06.340,0:34:09.000
Our duty now is...

0:34:09.070,0:34:14.600
This is the child of the house, but those children at home -

0:34:14.669,0:34:20.700
we need to ask where are they, so that we can take care of them. You are a mother.

0:34:20.710,0:34:24.630
You are a mother. This is the child of the house. We still have to ask those children.

0:34:24.630,0:34:29.400
We want to see them so we can take care of these children.

0:34:29.440,0:34:34.700
Take care of them. You are a mother.

0:34:34.720,0:34:39.322
We are going to ask those children and bring them home, take care of these children.

0:34:39.322,0:34:40.949
Please, I'm coming. Thank you.

Reconciled In Jesus' Name

0:35:30.140,0:35:32.800
Can you see God?

0:35:32.810,0:35:39.000
Can you see God? What beyond repair...

0:35:39.020,0:35:44.800
Beyond repair! Because of that deliverance...

0:35:44.810,0:35:50.000
No deliverance - no forgivness. Tell your neighbour.

0:35:50.000,0:35:57.000
Tell your neighbour again. I can't hear you.

0:35:57.089,0:36:04.800
Uncle, if somebody is telling you that he forgives you, just like that - without deliverance taking place - it is lips.

0:36:04.859,0:36:08.300
That forgivness is not from the heart.

0:36:08.339,0:36:15.700
If somebody does look at you and say, "I forgive you, I forgive you, it's over. I'm a Christian", - he now lies.

0:36:15.720,0:36:19.500
After deliverance that forgivness can come.

0:36:19.589,0:36:23.800
No deliverance - no forgiveness.

0:36:23.849,0:36:29.800
That's Jesus for you.

0:36:29.819,0:36:35.800
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
