Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"

0:00:55.300,0:01:01.240
"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in advance!"

Glory be to God! You are all welcome to the presence of God, in Jesus' name.

0:01:06.580,0:01:10.320
Right now, you may have your seats.

0:01:10.320,0:01:14.000
My name is Brother Chris, by the grace of God.

0:01:14.000,0:01:16.900
I'm from the UK.

0:01:16.900,0:01:21.680
I thank God for the wonderful privilege and honour to be here in your midst today.

0:01:21.680,0:01:25.620
I thank God for the life of His servant Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:01:25.620,0:01:31.820
who God used to mentor me, to guide me, to be in your midst this morning

0:01:31.820,0:01:35.820
to proclaim the wonderful news of our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:01:35.820,0:01:37.820
Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:42.680,0:01:46.080
Now, it is just two days to Christmas.

0:01:46.080,0:01:50.120
Tell your neighbour, "Merry Christmas!"

0:01:50.120,0:01:52.120
Like I mentioned before, I'm from the UK.

0:01:52.120,0:01:56.660
In the UK, we take Christmas very seriously - it is a serious issue.

0:01:56.660,0:01:59.380
Unfortunately, we don't take Christ very seriously.

0:01:59.380,0:02:02.540
I wish we would take Christ as seriously as we take Christmas.

0:02:02.540,0:02:06.820
But nevertheless, Christmas, we take it very seriously in the UK.

0:02:06.820,0:02:11.220
I believe around the world - different cultures, customs, communities -

0:02:11.220,0:02:13.300
we have our way of celebrating Christmas.

0:02:13.300,0:02:17.200
In the UK, we have many traditions and ceremonies attached to Christmas.

0:02:17.200,0:02:20.020
I just want to share with you a very quick story.

0:02:20.020,0:02:23.160
This is a true story - Christmas story.

0:02:23.160,0:02:25.520
Just to set the tone for today's message.

0:02:25.520,0:02:32.320
Now, one of the traditions on Christmas in the UK is that we have nativity plays.

0:02:32.320,0:02:34.160
Do you know what I mean by that?

0:02:34.160,0:02:39.860
In your school, the children will reenact the story of Jesus

0:02:39.860,0:02:42.760
when Jesus was born - it is called a nativity play.

0:02:42.760,0:02:48.580
Every year, without fail, your school must hold that nativity play

0:02:48.580,0:02:52.420
where they have Mary and Joseph and baby Jesus.

0:02:52.420,0:02:55.200
They go to the inn, they say, "There is no room in the inn".

0:02:55.200,0:02:57.880
They are taken finally to the manger, the stable.

0:02:57.880,0:03:00.460
She gives birth to baby Jesus.

0:03:00.460,0:03:02.400
We all know the story of Christmas.

0:03:02.400,0:03:04.380
We all know the story of Jesus.

0:03:04.380,0:03:08.800
Now, picture this. This was a nativity play that I attended.

0:03:08.800,0:03:11.980
These were little children.

0:03:11.980,0:03:20.120
It got to the part of the story where the sheperds and the wise men came to see Jesus

0:03:20.120,0:03:22.860
at the manger when he had just been born.

0:03:22.860,0:03:26.200
You guys know the story very well.

0:03:26.200,0:03:28.600
You know the story well?

0:03:28.600,0:03:31.720
Good. So I don't need to repeat to you the details of the story.

0:03:31.720,0:03:38.180
It got to the part where the three wise men who had travelled thousands of miles

0:03:38.180,0:03:41.040
to come and honour Jesus who had just been born.

0:03:41.040,0:03:43.040
They came to present their gifts.

0:03:43.040,0:03:45.200
Just picture this.

0:03:45.200,0:03:50.600
Three little kids are the three wise men, dressed in their robes and regalia to show they are wise men.

0:03:50.600,0:03:57.200
The first one walks forward and says, "We are wise men to see Jesus.

0:03:57.200,0:04:01.000
Here is the gift of gold".

0:04:01.000,0:04:03.760
Drops the gold; then walks back.

0:04:03.760,0:04:08.940
The second wise man comes forward - "And myrrh."

0:04:08.940,0:04:11.340
Drops it; walks back.

0:04:11.340,0:04:15.600
The third wise man, the little boy walks forward.

0:04:15.600,0:04:19.760
And he forgets his line.

0:04:19.760,0:04:23.400
I don't know whether you have ever been in that moment; it's very painful.

0:04:23.400,0:04:27.640
You know the family, the parents, everyone is there watching.

0:04:27.640,0:04:29.720
And the little boy just forgot his line.

0:04:29.720,0:04:34.620
Everyone was trying to - "Will you remember..."

0:04:34.620,0:04:36.780
Trying to get him remember the line.

0:04:36.780,0:04:41.620
The boy was worried; he was scared.

0:04:41.620,0:04:43.480
Everybody was tense.

0:04:43.480,0:04:49.160
In Nigeria, we would say, "Wahala don't come". That is the situation.

0:04:49.160,0:04:51.520
Everyone was tense, worried, "What is going to happen?"

0:04:51.520,0:04:53.940
Suddenly, the little boy remembered.

0:04:53.940,0:04:58.560
With a smile, he walks forward and says, "And Frank sent this".

0:04:58.560,0:05:04.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:04.400,0:05:05.840
Are you with me?

0:05:05.840,0:05:09.560
He walked forward, he forgot the line and said, "And Frank sent this".

0:05:09.560,0:05:11.560
Instead of "frankincense".

0:05:11.560,0:05:14.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:14.860,0:05:20.140
Now, I'm just trying to set the scene for today's message, the Christmas message.

0:05:20.140,0:05:22.660
But on a more serious note:

0:05:22.660,0:05:27.980
Today, we so often celebrate the tradition and ceremony of Christmas

0:05:27.980,0:05:35.460
and our focus is more on the story of the Baby Jesus, the story of the Christ of history,

0:05:35.460,0:05:39.720
the story of the Christ of song, the Christmas carols

0:05:39.720,0:05:44.040
and we overlook the reason for Christmas.

0:05:44.040,0:05:46.340
So I want to encourage you today:

0:05:46.340,0:05:58.000
Don't get so carried away by the ceremony of Christmas that you forget the reason for Christmas.

0:05:58.000,0:06:04.680
We should never allow the tradition of Christmas to overshadow our relationship with Jesus

0:06:04.680,0:06:07.460
because Jesus is the centre of Christmas.

0:06:07.460,0:06:21.040
Say, "Neighbour, Jesus is the centre of Christmas".

0:06:21.040,0:06:23.860
Without Jesus, there would be no Christmas.

0:06:23.860,0:06:30.060
Viewers around the world, today, we want to celebrate Jesus at Christmas.

0:06:30.060,0:06:34.980
Not just the Baby Jesus or the Christ of history, story, song,

0:06:34.980,0:06:37.120
the one we sing about in the Christmas carols.

0:06:37.120,0:06:41.940
We want to celebrate Jesus Christ revealed by the Holy Spirit.

0:06:41.940,0:06:44.880
And this will bring us to the title of today's message:

0:06:44.880,0:06:48.400
O COME LET US ADORE HIM

0:06:48.400,0:06:58.360
Say, "Neighbour, Christmas is all about Jesus".

0:06:58.360,0:07:02.100
Now, you may have observed that the title of today's message

0:07:02.100,0:07:05.760
comes from a very well known Christmas carol.

0:07:05.760,0:07:08.600
You know the song, "O come let us adore Him"?

0:07:08.600,0:07:10.340
I'm not hearing you; do you know it?

0:07:10.340,0:07:10.940
[Yes.]

0:07:10.940,0:07:14.620
Alright because we are going to sing it right now. Let's give it a go.

0:07:14.620,0:07:28.680
O come let us adore Him

0:07:28.680,0:07:45.220
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

0:07:45.220,0:07:47.660
Put your hands together for yourselves.

0:07:47.660,0:07:48.780
Put your hands together.

0:07:48.780,0:07:53.200
Let's just try this - men first; all the men, are you ready?

0:07:53.200,0:07:55.200
All the men - are you ready?

0:07:55.200,0:07:56.340
Ok, let's go.

0:07:56.340,0:08:11.920
O come let us adore Him

0:08:11.920,0:08:25.160
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

0:08:25.160,0:08:28.300
Alright, the women now; the females - let's go.

0:08:28.300,0:08:44.640
O come let us adore Him

0:08:44.640,0:08:59.360
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

0:08:59.360,0:09:01.360
Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:09:01.360,0:09:03.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:03.280,0:09:05.500
You may then have your seats in the presence of God.

0:09:05.500,0:09:10.640
I love the simple melody and the simple words, the simple truth of that carol.

0:09:10.640,0:09:14.000
O come let us adore Him

0:09:14.000,0:09:16.540
It's all about Jesus.

0:09:16.540,0:09:20.160
Today, the world is trying to commercialise Christmas.

0:09:20.160,0:09:26.780
They want to turn it to be about shopping, food and fun; just festivities.

0:09:26.780,0:09:31.500
Yet, Christmas is about those things but more importantly, it's about Jesus.

0:09:31.500,0:09:35.260
It's not about you, it's not about us - it's all about Him.

0:09:35.260,0:09:39.800
Unfortunately, many people when they sing that carol, in their hearts, there is a different song.

0:09:39.800,0:09:48.160
Some hearts are singing: "O come let us adore me.

0:09:48.160,0:09:53.180
O come let us adore me. Chris the Lord".

0:09:53.180,0:09:57.940
Why? - Because they are so focused on themselves.

0:09:57.940,0:10:00.820
Christmas to them is all about how they can enjoy the flesh,

0:10:00.820,0:10:03.300
enjoy the material things of this world.

0:10:03.300,0:10:08.560
Once again, brethren, I want to redirect your focus to who Christmas is all about -

0:10:08.560,0:10:11.300
it's all about Jesus.

0:10:11.300,0:10:15.340
If there was ever a time to celebrate and to acknowledge

0:10:15.340,0:10:19.140
and to revisit the love of God for us, this is the time.

0:10:19.140,0:10:27.660
So turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of 1 John 4.

0:10:27.660,0:10:29.520
We just want to use this Christmas season

0:10:29.520,0:10:34.100
as an opportunity to remind ourselves of how much Jesus loves us.

0:10:34.100,0:10:36.700
1 John 4:9 and it says:

0:10:36.700,0:10:41.000
"This is how God showed His love among us:

0:10:41.000,0:10:50.860
He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him."

0:10:50.860,0:10:51.900
Verse 10.

0:10:51.900,0:10:55.660
"This is love: not that we loved God,

0:10:55.660,0:11:03.060
but that He loved us and His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

0:11:03.060,0:11:09.000
Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."

0:11:09.000,0:11:10.480
Now.

0:11:10.480,0:11:15.620
In today's world, in our generation today,

0:11:15.620,0:11:21.240
if you look at the crises, the trouble, the turmoil in the world,

0:11:21.240,0:11:25.520
many people ask themselves the question, "Does God really love me?"

0:11:25.520,0:11:27.760
And that is one of satan's tactics.

0:11:27.760,0:11:34.040
One of satan's tactics is to try and get you to doubt God's love and goodness.

0:11:34.040,0:11:38.720
You begin to say, "All the trouble going on in the world, the evil happening,

0:11:38.720,0:11:41.260
the terrible things that are taking place" -

0:11:41.260,0:11:44.420
you just look around you, there is so much trouble,

0:11:44.420,0:11:49.660
there is political trouble, economic trouble, religious trouble.

0:11:49.660,0:11:51.860
I mean, we are in a world that is full of trouble.

0:11:51.860,0:12:01.660
And because of that, many hearts have grown cold to Jesus.

0:12:01.660,0:12:06.140
Many people's love has grown cold; their hearts have been hardened.

0:12:06.140,0:12:12.160
They become cynical, sceptical when it comes to Jesus or the things of God.

0:12:12.160,0:12:14.160
"You live, let me live.

0:12:14.160,0:12:17.460
I live my life, you live your life because look at what is happening in the world.

0:12:17.460,0:12:20.260
Where is God in the midst of this? Where is God in the midst of the sorrow?

0:12:20.260,0:12:23.640
Where is God in the midst of the trouble? Where is God in the midst of the trials?"

0:12:23.640,0:12:30.040
So, viewers, I want to encourage you today and challenge you today.

0:12:30.040,0:12:32.680
I don't know what situation you may be facing

0:12:32.680,0:12:36.300
that may be causing you to doubt God's love.

0:12:36.300,0:12:43.020
Perhaps, you are facing relentless troubles, hurtful hard times.

0:12:43.020,0:12:47.240
Perhaps, you are facing hatred, hunger or homelessness.

0:12:47.240,0:12:49.640
Perhaps, it is painful persecution.

0:12:49.640,0:12:52.760
You may be facing betrayal by your friends, family.

0:12:52.760,0:12:56.260
Or worse yet, your own awful sin.

0:12:56.260,0:13:01.880
But one thing I do know, one thing I'm assured of:

0:13:01.880,0:13:06.660
There is nothing, not one thing that is evil enough,

0:13:06.660,0:13:17.400
ugly enough, deep enough, powerful enough to stop God from loving you.

0:13:17.400,0:13:19.080
Nothing!

0:13:19.080,0:13:23.600
Nothing anyone could do to you could possibly sever that connection,

0:13:23.600,0:13:31.800
could dam the unstoppable, undeniable, unconditional love of God.

0:13:31.800,0:13:40.160
You can ignore God, you can reject Him, you can slander Him

0:13:40.160,0:13:45.380
but His love for you remains constant and unchanging.

0:13:45.380,0:13:50.120
No matter how many times we fail, God's love never does.

0:13:50.120,0:13:53.900
No matter how many times we fall, God's love never does.

0:13:53.900,0:13:58.680
No matter how many times we falter, God's love never does.

0:13:58.680,0:14:07.740
Apostle Paul said, "I am convinced that neither death nor life,

0:14:07.740,0:14:13.420
neither angels nor demons, neither the past nor the present, neither height nor depth,

0:14:13.420,0:14:23.660
nothing in this world can separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, my Lord".

0:14:23.660,0:14:38.260
Say, "Neighbour, God loves you as much as He does any of His children".

0:14:38.260,0:14:42.060
He loves you. Some of us begin to say, "Maybe God chose partiality;

0:14:42.060,0:14:46.080
this guy - He loves him more than me. He is showing favouritism". No!

0:14:46.080,0:14:47.860
The Father has no favourites.

0:14:47.860,0:14:50.720
There are no lucky ones in the Lord, no pets of Divinity.

0:14:50.720,0:14:52.800
He loves us.

0:14:52.800,0:14:57.540
Some people may be saying, "Why? How can we reconcile the two -

0:14:57.540,0:15:01.840
the troubles and the turmoil in the world and a loving, good God?"

0:15:01.840,0:15:03.660
I want to assure you, brethren.

0:15:03.660,0:15:10.180
God has not left us, abandoned us or closed the door on us;

0:15:10.180,0:15:16.540
we are the ones that have left Him.

0:15:16.540,0:15:20.340
God has not left us; He is with us.

0:15:20.340,0:15:22.560
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:15:22.560,0:15:25.260
That is our greeting in The SCOAN.

0:15:25.260,0:15:29.740
The question is: Are you with Him?

0:15:29.740,0:15:39.180
Because we easily stray from God and then question Him when our lives begin to go up and down.

0:15:39.180,0:15:43.900
Once again, brethren, this Christmas season is an opportunity

0:15:43.900,0:15:51.080
for you to realise how much God loves you.

0:15:51.080,0:15:55.940
God so loved the world that He gave His only Son.

0:15:55.940,0:16:04.180
Prophet T.B. Joshua explains, "God has a Son and He planted Him in the earth

0:16:04.180,0:16:06.380
to produce a family.

0:16:06.380,0:16:10.440
Today, millions are born again because of His best Seed".

0:16:10.440,0:16:16.260
That is why we are here today in the presence of God, celebrating His birth.

0:16:16.260,0:16:19.560
Millions are born-again because of His best Seed.

0:16:19.560,0:16:23.520
God gave us His best at Christmas.

0:16:23.520,0:16:25.720
Love was born at Christmas.

0:16:25.720,0:16:31.680
When you celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas, you are celebrating His love,

0:16:31.680,0:16:37.820
His joy, faithfulness, goodness, forgiveness.

0:16:37.820,0:16:40.540
Remember, by His love, we love.

0:16:40.540,0:16:43.640
In His love, we have a newness of life.

0:16:43.640,0:16:47.140
Through His love, we become a new man.

0:16:47.140,0:16:52.440
Jesus came to restore that relationship and fellowship between God and man.

0:16:52.440,0:16:54.060
That is why He came.

0:16:54.060,0:16:57.240
I want to challenge you today; it is a two-pronged message.

0:16:57.240,0:16:59.860
It is both a reminder of how much God loves you

0:16:59.860,0:17:06.900
and as a challenge to ask yourself, "How much do you love Him?"

0:17:06.900,0:17:13.160
What is your relationship with Him like?

0:17:13.160,0:17:17.200
The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do,

0:17:17.200,0:17:21.400
is not the services we attend, the prayers we pray,

0:17:21.400,0:17:24.680
the tithes, the offerings we drop.

0:17:24.680,0:17:28.840
I'm not saying they are not part of Christianity; they are all good but that is not the main thing.

0:17:28.840,0:17:35.820
The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do but the relationship we maintain

0:17:35.820,0:17:39.160
and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.

0:17:39.160,0:17:44.960
This means that nothing is more important than our relationship with Jesus.

0:17:44.960,0:17:56.420
Say, "Neighbour, nothing is more important than my relationship with Jesus".

0:17:56.420,0:18:04.740
Ask yourself today, "Is there anything in your life that is more important than Jesus?"

0:18:04.740,0:18:11.340
Just challenge yourself, "Is there anything in my life that is more important than Jesus?"

0:18:11.340,0:18:17.200
Jesus was asked in Matthew 22, "What is the greatest commandment?"

0:18:17.200,0:18:24.940
Jesus responded, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,

0:18:24.940,0:18:31.200
all your mind, all your soul and all your strength".

0:18:31.200,0:18:34.260
Love God above all.

0:18:34.260,0:18:36.720
That is the summary of the Scriptures.

0:18:36.720,0:18:39.120
Love Him above all.

0:18:39.120,0:18:41.940
This Christmas, challenge yourself.

0:18:41.940,0:18:44.380
As you go about celebrating the birth of Jesus,

0:18:44.380,0:18:59.900
ask yourself, "Do I love God above all or is He just one of those things that are important to me?"

0:18:59.900,0:19:03.380
God is the only reason; not one of these things.

0:19:03.380,0:19:11.900
I'm going to try and very simply do an example to practicalise this.

0:19:11.900,0:19:14.940
Let me get four volunteers.

0:19:14.940,0:19:18.260
One volunteer from here - any one volunteer.

0:19:18.260,0:19:22.360
Any one volunteer, you can just come forward.

0:19:22.360,0:19:24.000
Alright, sir, thank you very much.

0:19:24.000,0:19:25.800
Sir, you come and stand here.

0:19:25.800,0:19:28.020
I need one volunteer from here.

0:19:28.020,0:19:32.180
Our brother is instantly ready. You stand here.

0:19:32.180,0:19:34.660
I need another volunteer from here.

0:19:34.660,0:19:37.000
If God puts it in your heart, just come out.

0:19:37.000,0:19:39.100
Brilliant. That is three.

0:19:39.100,0:19:41.480
One more from here.

0:19:41.480,0:19:44.160
Ok, you can just come out. Wonderful.

0:19:44.160,0:19:51.020
So this is a very simple example and I want you to question yourself.

0:19:51.020,0:19:55.800
You sir, congratulations, you are going to represent God.

0:19:55.800,0:19:57.340
Thank You, Jesus.

0:19:57.340,0:19:59.620
God is "Thank You, Jesus" - wonderful.

0:19:59.620,0:20:03.320
Our brother is going to represent God; it's a wonderful role.

0:20:03.320,0:20:06.660
You sir, it is still a good role but not quite up to God.

0:20:06.660,0:20:08.460
You are going to represent Mr Money.

0:20:08.460,0:20:10.460
You are Mr Money, okay?

0:20:10.460,0:20:11.380
Okay.

0:20:11.380,0:20:12.880
Okay, wonderful.

0:20:12.880,0:20:15.240
Here is Mr Money - money.

0:20:15.240,0:20:21.780
You sir, are going to represent Mr Social Relations - friends, family, well-wishers, etc.

0:20:21.780,0:20:25.180
You sir, are going to represent Mr Position.

0:20:25.180,0:20:29.140
So we have God, we have Mr Money,

0:20:29.140,0:20:32.540
we have Mr Social Relations and we have Mr Position.

0:20:32.540,0:20:34.600
Are you with me, people of God?

0:20:34.600,0:20:36.860
I'm not hearing you - are you with me, people of God?

0:20:36.860,0:20:37.360
[Yes!]

0:20:37.360,0:20:39.360
Ok, so come, sir.

0:20:39.360,0:20:43.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:43.720,0:20:50.240
First of all, I want to show you how a Christian life should look.

0:20:50.240,0:20:55.780
God is not one of these things.

0:20:55.780,0:21:00.760
You can't compare Him to position, you can't compare Him to friends or family and

0:21:00.760,0:21:02.120
you can't compare Him to money.

0:21:02.120,0:21:03.700
God is not one of these things.

0:21:03.700,0:21:08.600
God is the only thing, the only reason.

0:21:08.600,0:21:11.920
Jesus is THE Way, not a way.

0:21:11.920,0:21:18.120
So in my journey through life, let's just say, I meet Mr Money here.

0:21:18.120,0:21:23.120
And Mr Money offers me some investment advice.

0:21:23.120,0:21:26.980
Sir, just tell me about a proposal that will involve money.

0:21:26.980,0:21:30.600
I want to give you 10 million US dollars, what are you going to do with it?

0:21:30.600,0:21:34.540
Wow, thank You, Jesus! 10 million! This is awesome!

0:21:34.540,0:21:38.340
Now, as a Christian, do you know what I'm supposed to do?

0:21:38.340,0:21:41.180
Immediately I hear from Mr Money, what do I do?

0:21:41.180,0:21:46.680
I go back to God and confirm from Him the step to take!

0:21:46.680,0:21:52.500
Because you just hear the money - 10 million - but God is concerned about the source.

0:21:52.500,0:21:54.500
Does that money come from stealing?

0:21:54.500,0:21:56.500
Does that money come from corruption?

0:21:56.500,0:21:58.900
Is that money blood money?

0:21:58.900,0:22:03.940
If I take it and it comes from stealing, I will use it for stealing.

0:22:03.940,0:22:06.600
Whatever comes from stealing, goes to stealing.

0:22:06.600,0:22:09.320
Whatever comes from corruption, goes to corruption.

0:22:09.320,0:22:12.320
Whatever comes from blood, goes to blood.

0:22:12.320,0:22:13.980
Are you with me?

0:22:13.980,0:22:15.880
So, what do I do?

0:22:15.880,0:22:19.160
As a Christian, I am meant to love God above all.

0:22:19.160,0:22:25.180
The meaning of this is - love nothing in comparison of God

0:22:25.180,0:22:28.900
but everything in reference to God.

0:22:28.900,0:22:31.920
So my brother offers me 10 million dollars. Wonderful.

0:22:31.920,0:22:34.480
What do I do? - I go back to God.

0:22:34.480,0:22:36.980
What does God say? What is God's opinion?

0:22:36.980,0:22:41.340
What is His will? What is His will in this matter?

0:22:41.340,0:22:46.180
And there will be guidance and direction, and you won't make a mistake.

0:22:46.180,0:22:48.600
I go to my brother here, Mr Social Relations.

0:22:48.600,0:22:51.200
Just invite me to a party, sir.

0:22:51.200,0:23:03.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:03.140,0:23:07.380
I will send him all kinds of friends - friends from everywhere.

0:23:07.380,0:23:08.540
Merci. (Thank you.)

0:23:08.540,0:23:13.280
Wonderful. This is a multilingual example here. Praise God.

0:23:13.280,0:23:17.340
My friend is inviting me; he said there is a party which has a lot of these friends;

0:23:17.340,0:23:18.680
my family will be there.

0:23:18.680,0:23:22.780
As a Christian, what am I supposed to do?

0:23:22.780,0:23:28.380
Nothing in comparison of God; everything in reference to God.

0:23:28.380,0:23:29.640
What does God say?

0:23:29.640,0:23:32.620
This party - is it a place where Jesus will be welcomed?

0:23:32.620,0:23:34.900
The activities there - are they in line with God?

0:23:34.900,0:23:38.020
Are they going to be serving and selling things that contradict my faith?

0:23:38.020,0:23:41.520
If I go there, am I going to be exposed to things that will pollute my spirit?

0:23:41.520,0:23:44.640
Carry God along.

0:23:44.640,0:23:45.700
As a Christian.

0:23:45.700,0:23:49.160
I'm going to Mr Position. Sir, you can just offer me a position.

0:23:49.160,0:23:54.420
I'm offering you the CEO position of a multinational company.

0:23:54.420,0:23:57.560
Wow! CEO!

0:23:57.560,0:23:59.680
Look, don't get carried away.

0:23:59.680,0:24:02.820
Don't begin to say, "Yes, sir" instantly. "I will be there tomorrow, sir."

0:24:02.820,0:24:05.400
What do you do as a Christian?

0:24:05.400,0:24:07.600
You go to God.

0:24:07.600,0:24:09.200
What does God say?

0:24:09.200,0:24:11.820
What is His will? What is His opinion?

0:24:11.820,0:24:15.620
Nothing in comparison of God; everything in reference to Him.

0:24:15.620,0:24:20.700
That is a Christian who loves God above all.

0:24:20.700,0:24:26.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:26.000,0:24:29.120
But many of us today...

0:24:29.120,0:24:30.620
Come, sir.

0:24:30.620,0:24:33.280
Many of us today - you know the problem we have?

0:24:33.280,0:24:35.820
Just stand here.

0:24:35.820,0:24:42.520
The problem we have today is that we see God as one of those thigns.

0:24:42.520,0:24:47.500
Yes, money is important to me; my friends, family are important to me.

0:24:47.500,0:24:50.300
My job, position; God too is important to me.

0:24:50.300,0:24:52.060
No!

0:24:52.060,0:24:57.820
How can you equate God, the Creator with the created?

0:24:57.820,0:25:04.300
How can you begin to put God at the same level with these material possessions?

0:25:04.300,0:25:06.040
But this is what many of us do.

0:25:06.040,0:25:10.520
By the time my brother here offers me that 10 million dollars,

0:25:10.520,0:25:12.520
I will seek some advice.

0:25:12.520,0:25:15.820
I will say, "God, want do you say about the 10 million dollars?"

0:25:15.820,0:25:21.060
It is nothing before me.

0:25:21.060,0:25:23.380
God says, it is nothing before Him.

0:25:23.380,0:25:27.060
He is saying, "Look, don't be too much in a haste and rush to take that money".

0:25:27.060,0:25:30.460
But I say, "Look, before I just listen to God, let me ask Position.

0:25:30.460,0:25:31.780
Maybe Mr Position has something to say.

0:25:31.780,0:25:34.360
What do you want to say about the 10 million dollars?

0:25:34.360,0:25:38.100
It is good money.

0:25:38.100,0:25:41.060
You begin to say, "Oh, this is difficult.

0:25:41.060,0:25:44.580
God is saying, maybe I shouldn't but look, Position is saying, it is good.

0:25:44.580,0:25:46.920
My friends, my family, they are going to agree.

0:25:46.920,0:25:49.260
10 million dollars - they will enjoy from that.

0:25:49.260,0:25:51.000
Money, of course, is offering it to me.

0:25:51.000,0:26:01.500
You begin to have confusion, conflict because you have equated God with the created.

0:26:01.500,0:26:08.120
Tell your neighbour, "Check yourself".

0:26:08.120,0:26:11.320
Now, this is not even the worst part of it.

0:26:11.320,0:26:12.960
Do you know the worst part of it?

0:26:12.960,0:26:18.460
Many of us today have not only put God as one of those things,

0:26:18.460,0:26:20.380
we have actually picked another God.

0:26:20.380,0:26:23.660
Come, sir.

0:26:23.660,0:26:29.740
Some of us have put Mr Money in the position of God.

0:26:29.740,0:26:33.740
You know, Christmas is a time to give, a time to love, a time to share.

0:26:33.740,0:26:36.920
God may speak to your heart and tell you to go and help someone.

0:26:36.920,0:26:38.240
"Go and take care of an orpan."

0:26:38.240,0:26:40.300
Just tell me to go and look after someone, sir.

0:26:40.300,0:26:43.220
Go and look after someone.

0:26:43.220,0:26:44.620
Take care of him.

0:26:44.620,0:26:46.640
Now, God has spoken to your heart.

0:26:46.640,0:26:50.540
There is an orphan; there is a homeless child. Go and look after them.

0:26:50.540,0:26:52.540
But do you know what many of us do?

0:26:52.540,0:26:54.180
"Let me quickly check with money.

0:26:54.180,0:26:55.960
Let me ask Mr Money first."

0:26:55.960,0:26:57.260
What is he going to say?

0:26:57.260,0:27:00.380
I want you to quit Christianity.

0:27:00.380,0:27:03.120
Wow. Money even wants me to quit Christianity. Crazy.

0:27:03.120,0:27:10.060
But in this case, money can never advise you to start helping people without an instant gain.

0:27:10.060,0:27:13.880
Money will want to see you put something and get something out.

0:27:13.880,0:27:17.020
You can't just go and help someone with no one there to give you back.

0:27:17.020,0:27:19.240
The principles of money do not permit that.

0:27:19.240,0:27:24.040
God is the one that will cause you and ask you to sow to the Spirit.

0:27:24.040,0:27:26.040
You will help someone without any return -

0:27:26.040,0:27:31.220
you sow to the Spirit; you reap peace of heart.

0:27:31.220,0:27:34.640
But money will say, "No! How can you waste your money on that?

0:27:34.640,0:27:36.920
There are investment here, there are investments there".

0:27:36.920,0:27:45.140
We have now put money, position, friends in the place of God.

0:27:45.140,0:27:48.120
We do everything in reference to money.

0:27:48.120,0:27:51.740
God may say, "Go here"; you say, "Let me quickly confirm from my family".

0:27:51.740,0:27:56.500
My family says, "Don't do it"; I say, "God, sorry. My family said I cannot go".

0:27:56.500,0:27:59.460
You put your family above God.

0:27:59.460,0:28:03.240
I'm not saying you should not love your family; I'm not saying we don't need money;

0:28:03.240,0:28:04.780
I'm not saying there is no good position.

0:28:04.780,0:28:07.400
I'm talking of what is your priority,

0:28:07.400,0:28:09.680
what is number 1 in your life.

0:28:09.680,0:28:13.920
God gave His best for you at Christmas.

0:28:13.920,0:28:19.760
Have you given your best to Him?

0:28:19.760,0:28:24.120
Let me round up this example. Come, sir.

0:28:24.120,0:28:26.300
Do you know one thing?

0:28:26.300,0:28:31.760
Sooner or later, you will realise this truth.

0:28:31.760,0:28:35.800
Money can fail you.

0:28:35.800,0:28:42.040
What you invested in for years can be gone in seconds.

0:28:42.040,0:28:47.100
Friends, family - they can fail you.

0:28:47.100,0:28:54.400
The person that is smiling at your front today can stab you in the back tomorrow.

0:28:54.400,0:29:02.560
The person you love - they can die, they can leave you tomorrow, they can fail you.

0:29:02.560,0:29:06.020
Position can fail you.

0:29:06.020,0:29:13.220
You have seen people who have been at the top today; tomorrow, they are at the bottom.

0:29:13.220,0:29:21.480
Only Jesus will never fail you!

0:29:21.480,0:29:28.020
Why would you then compare Him to this?

0:29:28.020,0:29:31.600
Oh my God!

0:29:31.600,0:29:35.300
What is going on?

0:29:35.300,0:29:40.900
Put your trust in money, man and materials - you are doomed to disappointment.

0:29:40.900,0:29:49.540
Put your trust in Jesus - you will never be confounded in time or eternity.

0:29:49.540,0:29:56.360
He is Alpha and Omega, beginning and end, first and last, the I AM that I AM.

0:29:56.360,0:29:58.660
He is God, Creator.

0:29:58.660,0:30:00.660
And you know one thing about God?

0:30:00.660,0:30:02.460
Let me tell you a truth about God.

0:30:02.460,0:30:06.700
As you are busy trying to please money, trying to please man,

0:30:06.700,0:30:10.540
trying to woo sympathy to gain position, God is just looking at you

0:30:10.540,0:30:14.840
because Prophet T.B. Joshua says, Jesus is a democrat;

0:30:14.840,0:30:18.040
He does not impose Himself on anyone.

0:30:18.040,0:30:20.140
He will not force you to follow Him.

0:30:20.140,0:30:22.140
He will not beg you to believe in Him.

0:30:22.140,0:30:24.140
He will not force you to serve Him.

0:30:24.140,0:30:26.280
He will wait.

0:30:26.280,0:30:30.840
By the time you have exhausted your worldly advantages -

0:30:30.840,0:30:33.840
you tried money, it failed you, you tried man that disappointed you,

0:30:33.840,0:30:35.840
you tried position, you don't have peace.

0:30:35.840,0:30:39.560
By the time you have exhausted your worldly advantages, you will come back to God

0:30:39.560,0:30:45.080
and at that time, you will value Him and put Him where He belongs -

0:30:45.080,0:30:52.440
put Him as number one, the first place.

0:30:52.440,0:30:56.260
And I pray you won't have grey hairs by the time you do that

0:30:56.260,0:30:59.920
because many of us are wasting so much time on Mr Money,

0:30:59.920,0:31:05.260
trying to please Mr Money, woo Mr Money, getting Mr Money's attention.

0:31:05.260,0:31:07.860
I'm not saying money is not good.

0:31:07.860,0:31:11.880
If this man gives me 10 million and I go to God and God sees it is clean and clear,

0:31:11.880,0:31:14.740
it is a blessing from Him, go ahead - "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:31:14.740,0:31:17.920
I'm talking about what is first in your life.

0:31:17.920,0:31:21.220
Today, if many of us received a call that 10 million dollars are waiting,

0:31:21.220,0:31:24.120
you would quickly tell the usher, "I'm going to the toilet".

0:31:24.120,0:31:26.440
From the toilet, you are gone.

Say, "Neighbour, this Christmas, love God above all".

0:31:40.060,0:31:47.240
O COME LET US ADORE HIM

0:31:47.240,0:31:49.640
Alright. Thank you very much to my wonderful actors.

0:31:49.640,0:31:53.580
You can come and take an altar fruit

0:31:53.580,0:31:56.520
so we can move on to a new life.

0:31:56.520,0:31:59.080
Mr Money will now give His life completely to Jesus.

0:31:59.080,0:32:00.800
Mr Position...

0:32:00.800,0:32:02.100
Wow.

0:32:02.100,0:32:06.060
This is altar fruit but because he is God, we cannot query him.

0:32:06.060,0:32:08.640
He should go ahead.

0:32:08.640,0:32:09.880
May God query him.

0:32:09.880,0:32:17.860
Now brethren, this is what Jesus meant in Matthew 6:33 when He said,

0:32:17.860,0:32:26.540
"Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness

0:32:26.540,0:32:31.920
and then everything else will be added unto you".

0:32:31.920,0:32:36.100
Today, we want to seek everything else; expect the Kingdom to follow.

0:32:36.100,0:32:40.400
But Jesus said, "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness

0:32:40.400,0:32:44.400
and then everything else will be added unto you".

0:32:44.400,0:32:53.480
Today, so many of us want to see Jesus but we are not prepared to seek Him.

0:32:53.480,0:32:58.060
We want to see Him but we are not ready to seek Him.

0:32:58.060,0:33:03.780
We want to see His miracles but we are not ready to seek His ways.

0:33:03.780,0:33:08.800
We want to see His power; we are not ready to seek His character.

0:33:08.800,0:33:15.440
We want to see Him but we are not prepared to seek Him.

0:33:15.440,0:33:18.960
Wise men still seek Jesus.

0:33:18.960,0:33:23.040
Wise women still seek Jesus.

0:33:23.040,0:33:27.840
Just as it was in the time when Jesus was born and the wise men came.

0:33:27.840,0:33:32.260
In our generation, wise men still seek Jesus.

0:33:32.260,0:33:36.120
If you just come to church today and you are just here for a miracle,

0:33:36.120,0:33:39.720
"God give me a miracle; give me blessing!",

0:33:39.720,0:33:42.080
I want to advise you this Christmas.

0:33:42.080,0:33:54.340
Stop seeking a miracle; start seeking Jesus and the miracle will come.

0:33:54.340,0:33:56.640
You know that God wants the best for you.

0:33:56.640,0:34:00.480
Christmas demonstrates that; He wants the best for you.

0:34:00.480,0:34:02.880
Why can't you trust Him, put Him first

0:34:02.880,0:34:09.220
and He will give you what His best for you in His time, in His way, for His glory?

0:34:09.220,0:34:14.660
Let's round up this message; coming to a conclusion.

0:34:14.660,0:34:22.320
If you want the ministry to be strong, your relationship with God must be strong.

0:34:22.320,0:34:28.420
I'm not just talking about those in the church - pastors or evangelists - for those in the vineyard. No!

0:34:28.420,0:34:33.500
As a Christian, whatever you do through God is your calling - your ministry.

0:34:33.500,0:34:38.480
Your profession as a Christian flows from your relationship with Jesus.

0:34:38.480,0:34:44.540
If you want your career to prosper, your relationship with God must prosper.

0:34:44.540,0:34:49.380
If you want your marriage to be strong, your relationship with God must be strong.

0:34:49.380,0:34:55.160
If you want your business to be great, your relationship with God must be great.

0:34:55.160,0:35:03.320
If you want this Christmas to be a Merry Christmas, your relationship with God must be merry.

0:35:03.320,0:35:10.740
Leaders, people in authority and position, if you want your nation to be great,

0:35:10.740,0:35:16.180
your relationship with God must be great.

0:35:16.180,0:35:21.180
Your great love for God will make you great

0:35:21.180,0:35:27.540
because whatever we do for God is a reflection of our relationship with God.

0:35:27.540,0:35:32.380
It is all about Jesus.

0:35:32.380,0:35:40.180
Stop talking about your limited education and start loving Jesus.

0:35:40.180,0:35:47.120
Stop complaining that everyone in my family is poor; start loving Jesus.

0:35:47.120,0:35:54.920
Stop repeating stories of those who have failed you in the past and start loving Jesus.

0:35:54.920,0:36:03.340
Stop pointing fingers at the economy of your nation, the politics of your nation

0:36:03.340,0:36:06.640
and start loving Jesus.

0:36:06.640,0:36:17.040
Stop meditating on your flaws, weaknesses, failures, frailties and start loving Jesus.

0:36:17.040,0:36:22.840
Your great love for God will make you great.

If the love of Christ is in our hearts, the world is under our feet and the sky is our limit.

0:36:40.800,0:36:48.440
Our love for Christ will produce this virtue and Christ's love for us will produce this effect upon us.

0:36:48.440,0:36:54.820
So brethren, this Christmas, love God above all.

0:36:54.820,0:37:04.160
May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
