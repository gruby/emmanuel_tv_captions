T.B. Joshua & Team Arrive At The Tropical Rainforest To Continue Their Journey To The School

0:08:04.560,0:08:08.180
Now, the journey to the new school begins.

0:08:08.180,0:08:16.820
Located in a remote area, 3 hours inside the Mache Chindul Ecological Reserve, transportation is difficult.

0:08:16.820,0:08:20.900
Five hours from Quito, inside the province of Esmeraldas,

0:08:20.900,0:08:26.520
the school can be reached only by 4x4 off-road vehicles or canoes,

0:08:26.520,0:08:31.040
but when conditions are bad, only on foot.

0:08:31.040,0:08:38.980
T.B. Joshua & Team Arrive At The Tropical Rainforest To Continue Their Journey To The School

0:08:38.980,0:08:46.760
T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team start their journey in 4x4 vehicles, into the jungle of Ecuador.

0:08:46.760,0:08:52.540
Not wanting his team to pass through the difficult elements, he has them enter inside the vehicle,

0:08:52.540,0:08:55.340
while he climbs into the back.

0:08:55.340,0:10:28.440
T.B. Joshua & Team Travel In 4x4 Vehicles Through A Tropical Rainforest To Reach The School

0:10:28.440,0:10:35.340
As they get deeper and deeper into the heart of the jungle, tropical rain suddenly starts to fall,

0:10:35.340,0:10:42.900
and the journey which had been smooth so far was about to take a more challenging turn.

0:10:42.900,0:11:06.640
T.B. Joshua & Team Travel In 4x4 Vehicles Through A Tropical Rainforest To Reach The School

0:11:06.640,0:11:13.840

Due To Heavy Rainfall The Vehicle Carrying T.B. Joshua & Team Gets Stuck In The Mud

0:11:26.580,0:11:30.260
With the important opening of the school just hours away,

0:11:30.260,0:11:36.900
T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team have no choice but to continue on foot.

0:11:36.900,0:11:40.760

T.B. Joshua & Team Enter A Second 4x4 Vehicle To Continue Their Journey To The School

0:12:20.460,0:12:24.880
However, with the wet and sticky conditions not easing off,

0:12:24.880,0:12:29.300
the vehicle soon gets stuck again, in another deep rut.

0:12:29.300,0:12:43.260
The Second Vehicle Also Gets Stuck In The Mud Due To Heavy Rainfall

0:12:43.260,0:12:46.180
T.B. Joshua encourages the team with a smile,

0:12:46.180,0:12:51.440
as they have to walk through the jungle in the pouring rain, yet again.

0:12:51.440,0:12:57.880
The local guides show T.B. Joshua an ingenious way of using the big leafy branches of plants

0:12:57.880,0:13:00.920
to shield themselves from the worst of the rain.

0:13:00.920,0:13:07.280
With a genuine smile, he obligingly tries it out, holding the giant leaf over his head,

0:13:07.280,0:13:12.380
as they continue the arduous track through the mountain pass.

An encouraging sight - the community finally comes into view,

0:14:11.940,0:14:18.480
as they take a turn on one of the ridges, and motivated the team begins to pick up their pace,

0:14:18.480,0:14:23.200
now that the end is in sight.

0:14:23.200,0:14:27.100

Our strength comes from God.

0:26:04.660,0:26:10.860
Jesus gave us enablement to do what we are doing.

0:26:10.860,0:26:14.800
He has no hands but our hands.

0:26:14.800,0:26:18.580
He has no tongue but our tongue.

0:26:18.580,0:26:27.760
So, we are here today to cut this cake at the count of Jesus.

God bless you all.

0:27:30.480,0:27:38.740
It is an honour for me to first give thanks to God for the presence of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:27:38.740,0:27:49.840
and everyone here.

0:27:49.840,0:28:00.120
With all my heart, the students of The Juan Lorenzo Anapa School appreciate you

0:28:00.120,0:28:10.960
for giving us classrooms of such quality that we didn’t have before.

0:28:10.960,0:28:23.240
Now we have this new school, we can study better and more comfortably.

0:28:23.240,0:28:38.600
We thank God for what happened on April 16 so that we could have something better.

0:28:38.600,0:28:43.120
Because after what happened on April 16, God touched the heart of

0:28:43.120,0:28:54.900
this organisation, Emmanuel TV and that is why we have this school.

0:28:54.900,0:29:11.660
Although you come from a far country, you have always been close to this community and the country, Ecuador.

0:29:11.660,0:29:23.700
That is why the students are very grateful for all that you have done.

0:29:23.700,0:29:50.460
I am from a different community but thanks to this school, I have the opportunity to study well.

0:29:50.460,0:29:55.740
I want to appreciate all the effort and love that the organisation, Emmanuel TV

0:29:55.740,0:30:04.160
has shown towards this community.

0:30:04.160,0:30:11.420

U.E.C.I.B Juan Lorenzo Anapa School Donated By Emmanuel TV For Nursery, Primary & Secondary Education

0:30:28.740,0:30:33.180
These are the class rooms and amenities built and financed solely

0:30:33.180,0:30:38.420
by Emmanuel TV partners across the world, and T.B. Joshua.

0:30:38.420,0:30:44.420
The school consists of several classroom blocks, for the different years of students in attendance,

0:30:44.420,0:30:49.000
and can comfortably accommodate over 300 people.

0:30:49.000,0:30:54.580
Taking a look inside of one of the classrooms, we can see that it is large and spacious enough

0:30:54.580,0:30:57.180
to hold classes of over 30 people.

0:30:57.180,0:31:03.100
The brand new, specially designed chairs have a sturdy wooden desk and shelf

0:31:03.100,0:31:08.200

that Jesus loves them.

0:35:49.280,0:35:54.380
a delicious meal and fruit drink was shared to each of the students and staff,

0:35:54.380,0:35:58.740

As you can see, now we are seeing a water tank.

0:37:06.260,0:37:09.840
This water is coming from the rain.

0:37:09.840,0:37:16.120
It is collected when it rains and this is the water they used to use

0:37:16.120,0:37:22.020
before Prophet T.B. Joshua sponsored and built this wonderful school

0:37:22.020,0:37:25.860
and provided this water supply from a borehole.

0:37:25.860,0:37:31.920
This borehole is solely to supply water for this school.

I have been working with the Ministry Of Public Health for 36 years.

0:38:42.080,0:38:46.640
The government brought me here to work together with my people.

0:38:46.640,0:38:56.540
I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for this great work that has made history in the Chachi community.

0:38:56.540,0:39:01.640
For this reason, we are very grateful for that school that we never expected to have

0:39:01.640,0:39:07.980
and for this great contribution from the prophet to the people who need it most in Ecuador.

0:39:07.980,0:39:13.340

We are very grateful to the Lord and to Prophet T.B. Joshua for coming to Ecuador.

0:39:25.240,0:39:32.540
Many institutions do not look at remote places in mountains and rural areas

0:39:32.540,0:39:36.340
but we give thanks to the Lord because Prophet T.B. Joshua has made a difference.

0:39:36.340,0:39:41.200
He has taught us what the Bible says that it is better to give than to receive.

0:39:41.200,0:39:46.140
We are very grateful because he has come with his whole team to Ecuador

0:39:46.140,0:39:48.880
who worked really hard in this community.

0:39:48.880,0:39:50.060

0:40:04.680,0:40:09.780
for having considered this indigenous community that is in need.

0:40:09.780,0:40:16.400
I am very grateful to him and his team for bringing joy to this community

0:40:16.400,0:40:24.160

I am very happy with what Emmanuel TV has done for the people.

0:40:42.200,0:40:45.900

0:41:01.480,0:41:06.080
We are talking about a school, an institution that all communities need.

0:41:06.080,0:41:11.060
I believe it is an international aid and solidarity that has come to support us in Ecuador.

0:41:11.060,0:41:15.880
The work that the government is supposed to do in the communities – you are doing it.

0:41:15.880,0:41:22.900

The journey back.

0:41:43.080,0:41:48.460
As T.B. Joshua's vehicle departed the school, due to the heavy rain which had fallen,

0:41:48.460,0:41:53.920
the vehicle loses its track and begins to slip and slide in the thick mud.

0:42:28.100,0:42:31.760
the car slides back down even further.

T.B. Joshua & The Emmanuel TV Team Have No Option But To Continue Their Journey On Foot

0:42:55.000,0:43:03.860
It is a long, tiring, almost two-hour walk back to the city, made all the more difficult by the thick squelchy mud.

0:43:03.860,0:43:07.420
A local farmer happens to pass by at that exact moment.

0:43:07.420,0:43:13.240
As he sees the team wading through the mud, he offers to take two people with him on the horse.

0:43:13.240,0:43:18.500
Ever the man of compassion, T.B. Joshua announces Mrs Evelyn Joshua and one of the team

0:43:18.500,0:43:24.340
to take the horse ride, while they continue on foot, along the muddy path.

0:43:24.340,0:43:27.840
OK, the two of you – tell him.

0:43:27.840,0:43:31.980
For two of you?

0:43:31.980,0:43:32.480
Yes.

0:43:32.480,0:43:36.900
Two can go with him.

Viewers, see me eating like any other person on the street.

0:44:18.620,0:44:24.120
Yes, I am running out of food.

0:44:24.120,0:44:26.560
That is humanitarian work for you.

0:44:26.560,0:44:32.020
Many a time we do this humanitarian work for God’s sake

0:44:32.020,0:44:34.920
and we run out of what we have given.

0:44:34.920,0:44:42.720
We went to give blessing; now, we are running out of that blessing.

0:44:42.720,0:44:51.980
Occasionally, this has to happen to test our faith, to test our genuineness, to test our gracious giving -

0:44:51.980,0:44:55.780
whether it is genuine or not.

0:44:55.780,0:45:00.700
It is not all the time you give and God supplies.

0:45:00.700,0:45:05.560
At times, you give and the supply will not come.

0:45:05.560,0:45:10.220
Our vehicle cannot go any further.

0:45:10.220,0:45:13.820
They are looking for another vehicle.

0:45:13.820,0:45:16.460
Sometimes, you may not find a vehicle – we will sleep here.

0:45:16.460,0:45:18.120
Are you not ready to sleep?

0:45:18.120,0:45:19.400
We are ready to sleep!
Yes, sir!

0:45:19.400,0:45:24.540
We are going on a mission and it is not all missions that are smooth.

0:45:24.540,0:45:27.260
Some can be very, very tough.

0:45:27.260,0:45:34.220
We are just experiencing this now – the toughest mission we are experiencing, we are going through

0:45:34.220,0:45:35.280
and it is a blessing.

0:45:35.280,0:45:38.400
What a rare privilege to suffer for the needy.

0:45:38.400,0:45:43.760
There are many people out there but God chose us to come and do this.

0:45:43.760,0:45:46.620
I can see a snail!

0:45:46.620,0:45:51.040
While Walking Back From The School T.B. Joshua Sights A Snail

0:45:51.040,0:45:53.540
Come and see the snail.

0:45:53.540,0:45:55.340
Yes, it is a big snail.

0:45:55.340,0:45:57.620
Not snake; it’s a snail.

0:45:57.620,0:45:59.900
Don’t let viewers feel threatened.

0:45:59.900,0:46:03.880
We are not looking for snakes; this is a snail.

0:46:03.880,0:46:05.140
Do you want to take this snail?

0:46:05.140,0:46:11.140
While Walking Back From The School T.B. Joshua Sights A Snail

0:46:11.140,0:46:14.300
Wonderful – but we don’t know where to eat it.

0:46:14.300,0:46:15.300
We need a fire.

0:46:15.300,0:46:20.080
Let’s ask this man if he can help us; we have to eat.

0:46:20.080,0:46:22.060
How are you?

0:46:22.060,0:46:25.080
Ask him whether he has seen the horse.

0:46:25.080,0:46:29.320
Did you see someone on a horse now?

0:46:29.320,0:46:30.840
From here? No.

0:46:30.840,0:46:32.880
No, he hasn't.

0:46:32.880,0:46:41.040
We are waiting for a horse which was carrying our loved ones.

0:46:41.040,0:46:44.460
When we were coming, the vehicle could not go – we were too many.

0:46:44.460,0:46:50.180
A man with a horse helped to carry two of us; we are waiting for them.

0:46:50.180,0:46:51.940
Where is he living?

0:46:51.940,0:46:52.560
Here.

0:46:52.560,0:46:54.080
OK, this house?

0:46:54.080,0:46:56.520
I hope you will host us today if we cannot go?

0:46:56.520,0:47:00.040
Of course, no problem!

T.B Joshua & His Team Encounter A Local Farmer Living Close By Who Agrees To Host Them

0:47:06.900,0:47:12.200
He says it is not far, he used to walk here every day.

0:47:12.200,0:47:17.920
The young man, also a local farmer, offers T.B. Joshua and the team a place to take a breather,

0:47:17.920,0:47:20.720
while they wait for the team on the horse.

0:47:36.080,0:47:38.200
This is the house we are going to.

T.B Joshua & His Team Encounter A Local Farmer Living Close By Who Agrees To Host Them

0:47:43.100,0:47:48.280
Occasionally, times can come this way.

0:47:48.280,0:47:52.540
Whatever comes, we have to accept it.

0:47:52.540,0:47:56.520
We went to give food; we are running out of food now.

0:47:56.520,0:47:59.460
We went to give help; we are running out of help now.

0:47:59.460,0:48:02.640
Sometimes, our faith can be tested.

0:48:02.640,0:48:05.840
It is not every time you give help that you will be helped.

0:48:05.840,0:48:08.560
So, this is the man God sent to us this time.

0:48:08.560,0:48:15.220
T.B. Joshua is introduced to the man's family and greets his daughter.

0:48:15.220,0:48:19.760
Thank you very much.

0:48:19.760,0:48:24.440
He wanted to go to the school but it was raining and he couldn't make it there.

0:48:24.440,0:48:31.740
I want to give them this 100 USD.

0:48:31.740,0:48:33.380
Thank you.

0:48:33.380,0:48:39.460
T.B. Joshua blesses the family with 100 USD, before he and the team take their leave.

0:48:51.760,0:48:58.380
Waving joyfully even after the long day, Mrs Joshua arrives on a horse and the team gets ready

0:48:58.380,0:49:03.200
to re-enter the vehicles and continue on their journey back to the city.

0:49:03.200,0:49:09.020
Before leaving, T.B. Joshua thanks the farmer who had assisted them with his horse.

The journey back.

0:49:47.340,0:49:53.720
With the community members waving a fond farewell, the Emmanuel TV team pack up their equipment,

0:49:53.720,0:49:58.800
and set about preparing for their journey back to the city.

0:49:58.800,0:50:03.940
While T.B. Joshua took the path of the mountain roads, due to the muddy conditions,

0:50:03.940,0:50:09.500
the rest of the team were going to travel by river in wooden canoes.

0:50:09.500,0:50:12.000
They are off, down the river.

Emmanuel TV Team Travels By Canoe Through The Tropical Rainforest

0:50:20.740,0:50:26.340
Where traditional punting failed, the guides had to get out and physically push the boats

0:50:26.340,0:50:28.500
along the river's shallow course.

0:50:28.500,0:50:34.320
Back to deeper waters, the canoes can start speeding along nicely.

0:50:34.320,0:50:36.920
Emmanuel TV Team Travels By Canoe Through The Tropical Rainforest

0:50:36.920,0:50:42.280
Even with the unrelenting rain, the level of the river is too low for the canoes

0:50:42.280,0:50:46.400
to use their on-board motors in many places.

As the skilled guides continue to navigate the long journey,

0:51:50.920,0:51:54.440
you really get the feel of how much a part of their everyday life

0:51:54.440,0:51:58.440
the river is to this community, deep in the jungle.

0:52:21.660,0:52:32.880
At a point, the team has gone as far as they can by river and disembark from the boats.

0:52:32.880,0:52:37.500
Next, the Emmanuel TV team climbs aboard a couple of pick up trucks,

0:52:37.500,0:52:42.440
on the other side of the river bank to continue on to the city.

The distinguished guests begin to arrive with their families for the meeting.

0:53:43.300,0:53:49.260
Each of the dignitaries are welcomed warmly by the Emmanuel TV team as they arrive.

0:53:49.260,0:53:55.740
Let us hear a few words from some of the special guests who came to grace the event.

0:53:55.740,0:54:12.580
Engineer Efren Reyes
Deputy Minister Of Social & Economic Inclusion of Ecuador

0:54:12.580,0:54:17.020
Good evening. My name is Efren Reyes.

0:54:17.020,0:54:29.120
I am from Quito, Ecuador and I am Deputy Minister of Social and Economic Inclusion.

0:54:29.120,0:54:32.080
It is a pleasure for me to be here with Emmanuel TV.

0:54:32.080,0:54:37.780
We thank Emmanuel TV for the invitation to be a part of this event which is very important for us

0:54:37.780,0:54:42.040
because I believe it is the climax of Emmanuel TV’s humanitarian aid in Ecuador.

0:54:42.040,0:54:47.500
Within that was all the relief aid and foodstuffs that were donated to the earthquake victims.

0:54:47.500,0:54:59.620
I joined Emmanuel TV to distribute the relief aid to the shelters, especially in Esmeraldas.

0:54:59.620,0:55:12.340
We found an area in need of help, the indigenous Chachi community which needed a school.

0:55:12.340,0:55:23.260
Made aware of the need, Emmanuel TV helped by building a school for the children.

0:55:23.260,0:55:27.860
We are very happy that now the school is completed and ready

0:55:27.860,0:55:33.360
for the children of the Chachi community to begin their studies.

0:55:33.360,0:55:37.160
It is a pleasure to talk about the reason that we are here.

0:55:37.160,0:55:42.300
We are here because Emmanuel TV has done a lot of things for Ecuador,

0:55:42.300,0:55:45.600
after an earthquake that we suffered last year.

0:55:45.600,0:55:54.720
They helped us with 20 tons of aid relief, that we shared in shelters in Esmeraldas province,

0:55:54.720,0:56:05.080
in coordination with us, the Ministry of Social Inclusion; we helped many families affected by the earthquake.

0:56:05.080,0:56:11.460
Also, Emmanuel TV identified a community that was in need of a school,

0:56:11.460,0:56:17.560
and they decided to do a project to give the opportunity of education

0:56:17.560,0:56:23.200
to the children from the Chachi community.

0:56:23.200,0:56:24.980
It is a pleasure for us to be here.

0:56:24.980,0:56:29.200
The Emmanuel TV team is committed to helping those in need.

0:56:29.200,0:56:34.300
This is the reason we have formed this great working team, stronger together.

0:56:34.300,0:56:40.660
I really think that Emmanuel TV Team and T.B. Joshua are great people.

0:56:40.660,0:56:45.820
I can say that we have created a team.

0:56:45.820,0:56:53.200
We have worked together and I have seen that they have these warm feelings for the people,

0:56:53.200,0:56:56.700
this sense of helping others.

0:56:56.700,0:57:00.180
That's why I'm saying that together we are stronger.

0:57:00.180,0:57:05.160

0:58:13.120,0:58:23.800
and now, a school has been built to benefit the community affected by the earthquake.

0:58:23.800,0:58:32.260
We are forever grateful to Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team.

0:58:32.260,0:58:42.720

I am from Quito, I am a Christ's soldier and a Council member.

1:00:46.140,1:00:54.540
This is the gratitude of a nation who are here today to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:00:54.540,1:01:06.620
for these 20 tonnes of relief aid, medicine, love and healing that arrived after April, 2016

1:01:06.620,1:01:13.140
when the earthquake struck the Ecuadorian coast with suffering.

1:01:13.140,1:01:23.700
This message of love and seed of care arrived which is reflected in the building of the school

1:01:23.700,1:01:30.540
and hundreds of families that were beneficiaries of these 20 tonnes of aid.

1:01:30.540,1:01:33.180

1:01:45.080,1:01:55.780
They were 20 tonnes of love, of help, of charity for our people after the earthquake on April 2016.

1:01:55.780,1:02:03.080
We are here to appreciate him, because he also decided to help the community's children

1:06:39.080,1:06:45.000
Thank you very much.

1:06:45.000,1:06:49.260
Now, I can introduce myself.

1:06:49.260,1:06:59.660
I am your brother; my name is T.B. Joshua.

1:06:59.660,1:07:30.800
I am truly humbled and honoured to be here today with my wife, children and some of my team

1:07:30.800,1:08:03.200
and with a high profile humanitarian personality here in our midst with us, the founder of ZAKA.

1:08:03.200,1:08:22.280
Just as we are Emmanuel TV, he is the founder of ZAKA – Israeli Search And Rescue Organisation.

1:08:22.280,1:08:24.400
Thank you very much.

1:08:24.400,1:08:41.880
I don’t want to forget how I heard about the trouble in Ecuador.

1:08:41.880,1:08:48.680
I was watching a channel that night and I saw that earthquake

1:08:48.680,1:08:51.340
and I saw children’s schools collapse.

1:08:51.340,1:08:55.860
I said, “Wow!”; I was touched.

1:09:10.020,1:09:20.400
I quickly sent a message to all my teams all over the world that they should watch the news,

1:09:20.400,1:09:43.460
that something had happened in Ecuador, that I was touched and that we had to come to rescue.

1:09:43.460,1:09:50.220
This is how our journey began.

1:09:50.220,1:10:09.720
This occasion would not have taken place here without the people of Ecuador,

1:10:09.720,1:10:17.720
the leaders in the school

1:10:17.720,1:10:29.680
and also the leaders in the community of the children’s school.

1:10:29.680,1:10:40.340
I want to say a very big thanks for their support.

1:10:40.340,1:10:47.500

1:10:47.500,1:10:55.240
Knowing God, serving God is helping people.

1:10:55.240,1:11:00.740
When we say we know God, we must help people; we must support people.

1:11:00.740,1:11:05.920
We must make sure whatever we can do to rescue people, we must do it.

1:11:05.920,1:11:07.920
That is serving God.

1:11:07.920,1:11:12.180
For our people, for our children in Ecuador and all over the world,

1:11:12.180,1:11:18.400
it is a pleasure to do every proper thing to support them.

1:11:18.400,1:11:24.440
We are ready to give our life to make sure they remain the leaders of tomorrow.

1:11:24.440,1:11:27.420
This is why we are here.

As I said, if I would thank everyone, we would not leave here tonight.

1:15:37.480,1:15:53.580
Thank you all so much for enabling us to have the joy of giving and sharing with you.

1:15:53.580,1:15:59.740
Now, we would like to invite General Carlos Medina

1:15:59.740,1:16:07.100

It is not only a personal honour, it is a national satisfaction to express to Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:17:28.420,1:17:35.060
our heartfelt appreciation for all the aid that we have received.

1:17:35.060,1:17:38.020
Initially, they brought foodstuff and essential aid.

1:17:38.020,1:17:43.360
Today, they have built a school for our Ecuadorian children.

Once more, on behalf of the Ecuadorian Army, I would sincerely like to thank you for being

It is a great privilege for me tonight

1:29:41.700,1:29:44.820
and I am very exited.

1:29:44.820,1:29:59.620
I was in Mexico and God really amazed me by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:29:59.620,1:30:09.140
The work that has taken place in Esmeraldas Province -

1:30:09.140,1:30:20.300
we were the foundation that had to put into practice what we had learned from him.

1:30:20.300,1:30:29.160
As a foundation we learned from him; we had an opportunity to apply it when the earthquake happened.

1:30:29.160,1:30:42.900
Publicly, I want to say that the Gospel that I preach changed.

1:30:42.900,1:30:56.240
We can’t preach the Word if we don’t meet the need of others.

1:30:56.240,1:31:07.740
I want to deeply appreciate Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has done in our province.

1:32:30.240,1:32:31.300
Good evening.

1:32:31.300,1:32:37.000
The truth is that I am not used to speaking much in public.

1:32:37.000,1:32:45.800
But I know that God will give me the perfect words to appreciate this great man.

1:32:45.800,1:32:55.680
I appreciate him on behalf of my people and above all, God.

1:32:55.680,1:32:58.760
As the Word of God says in Psalm 41:1,

1:32:58.760,1:33:03.180
“Blessed is he that considers the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble.”

1:33:03.180,1:33:11.680
I thank him so much on behalf of everyone.

1:33:11.680,1:33:14.120
You know how much we have suffered with the earthquake

1:33:14.120,1:33:18.400
but we also know the promise of the Lord that it will not happen again because God is merciful

1:33:18.400,1:33:24.700
and we are praying to Him – the true and living God.

1:33:24.700,1:33:28.780
Everybody knows how much we suffered because of the earthquake,

1:33:28.780,1:33:34.160
but we have the promise of God that something like that will not happen again.

1:33:34.160,1:33:37.100
The mercy and love of God are with us.

1:33:37.100,1:33:41.600
Also many thanks to all the people who joined the pastor in this great work

1:33:41.600,1:33:44.760
because without God’s help, nothing would have been possible.

1:33:44.760,1:33:48.020
We always know that we were never alone because we have a living God

1:33:48.020,1:33:50.520
and His name is the Lord of Hosts.

So, finally, we would like to invite the representative of the Chachi community of San Salvador -

1:34:36.320,1:34:40.240
Mr Santiago to come and...

Emmanuel TV Team Welcomes The Representative Of The Chachi Community

1:34:48.180,1:34:53.420
Good evening, everyone.

1:34:53.420,1:35:02.120
This is a special moment not just for the guests present and the delegation from Emmanuel TV

1:35:02.120,1:35:08.100
but also for the community of San Salvador de Los Chachis for the monumental work

1:35:08.100,1:35:10.620
that we are inaugurating today.

1:35:10.620,1:35:16.940
This is a very special moment, not only for those who are here now - Emmanuel TV team,

1:35:16.940,1:35:22.480
but also for all of the Chachi community.

1:35:22.480,1:35:38.740
The videos and pictures show the process of the construction work and those who participated.

1:35:38.740,1:35:49.820
As you can see on the video and the pictures, they show the process of these amazing contributions.

1:35:49.820,1:36:07.520
The Chachi Community considers and appreciates what T.B. Joshua has done not only physically

1:36:07.520,1:36:12.800
but also spiritually and prophetically.

1:36:12.800,1:36:18.480
Mr Santiago, Chachi Community Representative Appreciates T.B. Joshua For New Ecuador School

1:36:18.480,1:36:29.200
The Chachi community appreciates what Prophet T.B. Joshua has done in our community;

1:36:29.200,1:36:38.640
not only a physical contribution and help - it has been a spiritual and prophetic help.

1:36:38.640,1:36:46.460
I say this because the school that collapsed in the earthquake was built 40 years ago.

1:36:46.460,1:36:56.800
This school was built by the hands of the community members.

1:36:56.800,1:37:07.140
This school is 40 years now and initially it was built by members of the community.

1:37:07.140,1:37:17.000
It was a blessing of God that something that we dreamt of a long time ago

1:37:17.000,1:37:22.700
has come to reality.

1:37:22.700,1:37:32.040
For us it is a great blessing from God, that what we always dreamt of, concerning the school,

1:37:32.040,1:37:39.640
has today materialized in our community.

1:37:39.640,1:37:49.680
The children – over 300 students and 14 teachers are very happy.

1:37:49.680,1:37:57.900
We as a community are also happy because our children don’t have to go through so much

1:37:57.900,1:38:03.520
difficulty in the education process as they had to before.

1:38:03.520,1:38:11.540
Now they have beautiful new classrooms to aid their learning.

1:38:11.540,1:38:21.980
More than 300 children from the school, the teachers and the whole community are very joyful

1:38:21.980,1:38:32.520
because now they can have their education in proper classrooms what they did not have before.

1:38:32.520,1:38:40.140
From the beginning of the construction process, the community joyfully received

1:38:40.140,1:38:48.800
the presence of Emmanuel TV and we had the faith and assurance that the job would be

1:38:48.800,1:38:55.500
carried out with success in line with the vision of the project.

1:38:55.500,1:39:00.220
From the beginning, we were very happy to receive the Emmanuel TV team,

1:39:00.220,1:39:07.960
and we truly believed that this work would be fulfilled.

1:39:07.960,1:39:16.320
We were sure that God was with us and with the power that God gave T.B. Joshua,

1:39:16.320,1:39:21.520
this project would be completed.

1:39:21.520,1:39:25.880
Mr Santiago, Chachi Community Representative Appreciates T.B. Joshua For New Ecuador School

1:39:25.880,1:39:34.840
We were sure that God was with us, and the power that God has given to Prophet T.B. Joshua

1:39:34.840,1:39:41.120
would make this dream come real in our community.

1:39:41.120,1:39:52.880
On behalf of my community and the Chachi people of Ecuador, I want to convey

1:39:52.880,1:39:58.260
this joy and appreciation to T.B. Joshua, the Emmanuel TV team and everyone

1:39:58.260,1:40:06.200
who worked with the foundation as well as the technical team under the architect

1:40:06.200,1:40:13.220
and all those who came together to make this dream come true.

1:40:13.220,1:40:20.540
On behalf of the Chachi community of Ecuador, we appreciate Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has done,

1:40:20.540,1:40:26.440
and we also appreciate all those who joined in this amazing job.

1:40:26.440,1:40:32.000
The Juan Lorenzo Anapa School Built & Donated By Emmanuel TV

1:40:32.000,1:40:36.000
On behalf of the community, we also want to express our desire for T.B. Joshua

1:40:36.000,1:40:42.340
with the help of God to continue aiding the needy all over the world

1:40:42.340,1:40:46.260
in disaster-affected areas like ours.

1:40:46.260,1:40:59.560
As a community we want to tell T.B. Joshua, with the help of God, to continue helping the needy,

1:40:59.560,1:41:05.320
when they face this kind of natural disasters.

1:41:05.320,1:41:12.100
We know that in humanitarian work, distance is not a barrier.

1:41:12.100,1:41:15.760
Nigeria is a faraway country compared to Ecuador

1:41:15.760,1:41:22.380
but the humanitarian aid reached us and today we have Prophet T.B. Joshua in our midst

1:41:22.380,1:41:26.320
in Ecuador for which we feel very blessed.

Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV

1:41:34.020,1:41:40.460
We learned that when someone wants to help, there is no barrier, there is no distance,

1:41:40.460,1:41:47.540
because you are coming all the way from Nigeria which is very far to come and help us.

1:41:47.540,1:41:50.380
We really appreciate that.

1:42:03.160,1:42:08.420
the magnificent school built in our community.

1:42:08.420,1:42:11.100
Thank you and God bless you.

Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav

1:42:35.100,1:42:39.460
Good evening, everybody.

1:42:39.460,1:43:02.680
It took us 26 hours of flying to get here for such a special occasion this evening.

1:43:02.680,1:43:07.080
ZAKA’s Rabbi Yehuda Appreciates T.B. Joshua And Greets Ecuadorian Dignitaries

1:43:07.080,1:43:26.060

1:43:26.060,1:43:33.840
ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:43:33.840,1:43:54.340
It is so wonderful to go and do things together with Prophet T.B. Joshua in his unique organisation.

1:43:54.340,1:44:03.480
Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV

1:44:03.480,1:44:07.680
It is a privilege and honour that ZAKA and Emmanuel TV – two big organisations -

1:44:07.680,1:44:20.860
gather together to help others around the world.

1:44:20.860,1:44:31.540
ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:44:31.540,1:44:38.160
The Bible says that God created people; it doesn’t say what colour or what nation they were from.

1:44:38.160,1:44:40.760
He created people and we are supposed to help each and every person

1:44:40.760,1:44:43.160
wherever they are and whatever they believe.

1:44:43.160,1:45:08.980
ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:45:08.980,1:45:32.280
We are all brothers and are here to help each other in good times and in disasters.

1:45:32.280,1:45:47.720
ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:45:47.720,1:46:19.220
So, when someone from our family is in trouble, we are here to help in whatever way we can.

God wants us to work together and help each other by sharing our knowledge and love.

1:47:23.180,1:47:34.980
The Bible says that if you save one life, it is like you have saved the whole world.

ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:47:45.280,1:48:01.660
To save lives is not just by giving someone CPR or helping if they have a fracture.

1:48:01.660,1:48:10.320
ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:48:10.320,1:48:23.780
For the prophet to build a school for the students, they will learn more and teach their children

1:48:23.780,1:48:29.900
and it becomes a project for life.

1:48:29.900,1:48:59.720
ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony

1:48:59.720,1:49:07.660
Like the prophet said in the meeting with the Vice President, ZAKA is here

1:49:07.660,1:49:21.480
to help you train people so that if this happens again, you can save more lives.

And now as we bring the proceedings to a close,

1:50:20.460,1:50:28.940
could we invite the Chachi community to come forward please.

Let us go back to the last words of T.B. Joshua on the opening day of the school donated by Emmanuel TV.

1:51:30.700,1:51:34.380
We give all glory to God!

1:51:34.380,1:51:43.420
I was with the Vice President yesterday.

1:51:43.420,1:51:57.520
I am going to have another meeting to let him know what I went through to come here today.

1:51:57.520,1:52:04.400
We cannot allow our children to continue like this.

1:52:04.400,1:52:09.200
It is too tense for our children.

1:52:09.200,1:52:21.100
They have to find something to do – most especially on the roads to this place.

1:52:21.100,1:52:26.520
Thank you very much.
