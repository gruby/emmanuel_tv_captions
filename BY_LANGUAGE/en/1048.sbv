0:00:00.030,0:00:02.020
At the Synagogue Church of All Nations,

0:00:02.020,0:00:05.660
Prophet TB Joshua leads
 the congregation in mass prayer.

0:00:05.660,0:00:08.920
And the power of God immediately comes on the scene

0:00:08.920,0:00:12.140
and uproots whatever that is not of God in their lives.

0:00:12.140,0:00:14.600
He begins to prophesy and exposes the hand

0:00:14.600,0:00:18.760
of the devil in the lives of the people. Let's listen to him.

0:00:18.760,0:00:22.880
There is a brother, you have tatoo  
everywhere; I think I touched you.

0:00:22.880,0:00:26.020
With your tattoo, here.

0:00:26.020,0:00:30.380
You're a criminal, 
you are wearing dark, dark.

0:00:30.380,0:00:35.060
That spirit is tormenting you, 
disturbing you, okay?

0:00:35.060,0:00:42.640
TESTIMONY TIME

0:00:42.640,0:00:44.800
Good morning, church!

0:00:44.800,0:00:47.300
Glory be to God.

0:00:47.300,0:00:49.580
My name is Tebogo. 
I'm from South Africa.

0:00:49.580,0:00:51.560
I am 37 old.

0:00:51.560,0:00:57.020
I am a firstborn from the three
 boys that have been given birth to this

0:00:57.020,0:00:59.200
wonderful woman here right beside me.

0:00:59.200,0:01:00.000
This is my mum.

0:01:00.000,0:01:06.680
Tebogo & Mother - Prophecy Testimony

0:01:06.680,0:01:12.300
Yes, I'm thankful to be here, all glory be to God.

0:01:12.300,0:01:17.560
Last weekend Prophet TB Joshua
 actually prophesied and called me

0:01:17.560,0:01:18.535
from the crowd.

0:01:18.540,0:01:21.280
I was actually sitting right at the back

0:01:21.280,0:01:24.440
and I didn't want to sit in the front.

0:01:24.450,0:01:28.650
But he actually called me and he
 told me that, this is something

0:01:28.650,0:01:31.409
I never told nobody and I think
 nobody knew about that.

0:01:31.409,0:01:35.220
But he just called me and told me
 that I used to live a life of a crime,

0:01:35.220,0:01:37.740
and that this spirit is actually tormenting me

0:01:37.740,0:01:40.880
and it's going to disturb me and give me trouble.

0:01:40.880,0:01:44.420
That's when I came out. 
Yes, indeed it is true.

0:01:44.420,0:01:47.180
Though some of the things that I'm going to say,

0:01:47.180,0:01:49.660
this is the first time that I will be telling the truth.

0:01:49.660,0:01:51.440
Even my mum I never told her the truth.

0:01:51.440,0:01:55.500
This is the first time that she'll
 be hearing me saying this,

0:01:55.500,0:01:58.280
live on camera.

0:01:58.280,0:02:02.980
It actually started when it was around 1996.

0:02:02.980,0:02:06.380
I was in my high school year.

0:02:06.380,0:02:08.400
Raised as a boy with good values,

0:02:08.400,0:02:12.240
being in high school, getting straight A's from school...

0:02:12.240,0:02:15.880
By then I was a good boy in the house doing all chores,

0:02:15.880,0:02:17.277
being good in the house.

0:02:17.277,0:02:20.810
But every time I went to the street,
everything changed though -

0:02:20.810,0:02:23.620
I had to be like a crook in the neighborhood

0:02:23.620,0:02:26.020
due to being growing under the older guys

0:02:26.020,0:02:29.900
that used to stay next to a park.

0:02:29.900,0:02:33.340
So they used to sell drugs and have cars.

0:02:33.340,0:02:35.420
So they taught us how to car wash,

0:02:35.420,0:02:39.180
and how to open a car without 
a key and things like that.

0:02:39.180,0:02:45.180
So we sold weed and drugs 
in that mini park.

0:02:45.180,0:02:49.220
So that's how I got introduced to
 the street life.

0:02:49.220,0:02:52.300
So at what age were you when you actually began

0:02:52.300,0:02:55.860
the issue of selling drugs and
 meeting with these older gang members?

0:02:55.860,0:02:57.400
At what age were you?

0:02:57.400,0:03:02.260
I was still young, it was my early 
years of studying in high school.

0:03:02.260,0:03:07.280
I think I was 16 - 17 years old.

0:03:07.280,0:03:10.174
We actually started just looking at them,

0:03:10.180,0:03:13.320
doing what they do, like having guns out there,

0:03:13.320,0:03:15.460
washing cars and doing all these things.

0:03:15.460,0:03:16.920
So they taught us how to -

0:03:16.920,0:03:21.100
like I said - open a door of a car
 without having the keys,

0:03:21.100,0:03:25.220
and knowing which cables you can
 can start a car without using a key.

0:03:25.220,0:03:29.920
And we used to sell drugs by
 the parks that we used to be playing games.

0:03:29.920,0:03:33.200
By the park we used to do recreational things.

0:03:33.200,0:03:36.240
We used to play, tumbling and all that,

0:03:36.240,0:03:40.240
but then we would be around the park and selling drugs for them.

0:03:40.240,0:03:44.560
Me having that and my mum
not knowing what I was doing -

0:03:44.560,0:03:46.880
I would go back and I would be a good boy in the house

0:03:46.880,0:03:50.120
but every time I went outside in the street,

0:03:50.120,0:03:52.360
those are the things I had to do -

0:03:52.360,0:03:57.080
doing the material and vanity...

0:03:57.080,0:04:00.620
As a youth, those are the things that 
were actually exciting me as a group.

0:04:00.620,0:04:07.980
So I was a junior member of a gang,
 as you would like to say.

0:04:07.980,0:04:13.660
That's when we started being in the park, we started robbing people with knives.

0:04:13.660,0:04:16.460
But at first I was young, we would 
drop like vulnerable people,

0:04:16.460,0:04:19.480
like people who are drunk or people 
who are a couple which is chilling

0:04:19.480,0:04:22.800
at a park. We just robbed them their belongings like that.

0:04:22.800,0:04:27.460
And then it went to be like graduating like having a gun,

0:04:27.460,0:04:30.760
of which a gun is something that I... 
The first encounter with a gun

0:04:30.760,0:04:32.420
with me and my friends -

0:04:32.420,0:04:35.600
I think it  was in 1997 or towards 1997 or so,

0:04:35.600,0:04:38.340
I was still in high school with the 
best friend of mine

0:04:38.340,0:04:42.840
and we actually disarmed the 
gun from a friend of mine -

0:04:42.840,0:04:46.720
the other friend of mine who came with 
his father's gun and he showed us the gun

0:04:46.720,0:04:48.520
But we took a gun from him.

0:04:48.520,0:04:53.220
But we had a fight - me and my friend again

0:04:53.220,0:04:56.140
because we actually didn't know 
who was supposed to keep the gun.

0:04:56.140,0:04:59.040
I wanted to keep it - he wanted to keep it too.

0:04:59.040,0:05:02.080
So we kept the gun between 
us - sometimes it would be in my house,

0:05:02.080,0:05:05.200
sometimes it would be in his house.

0:05:05.200,0:05:10.640
And that's how we ended up like selling drugs,

0:05:10.640,0:05:15.180
after selling drugs we started
 disarming other people

0:05:15.180,0:05:17.540
who were selling drugs in our community

0:05:17.540,0:05:20.240
because we wanted actually to own the territory.

0:05:20.240,0:05:22.680
So if we knew that you were selling drugs in our community,

0:05:22.680,0:05:26.300
then we would come through to you and rob you

0:05:26.300,0:05:28.980
with a gun - from knives to guns.

0:05:28.980,0:05:33.520
And then, having money
 for drugs and things like that

0:05:33.520,0:05:38.720
we actually moved on to disarming 
other guys who had guns.

0:05:38.720,0:05:42.700
And that brought us some more of other gangs.

0:05:42.700,0:05:44.280
By then I was still young,

0:05:44.289,0:05:47.460
I was still being used because I didn't have fear.

0:05:47.460,0:05:50.747
I wouldn't have fear, I didn't hesitate
 in doing things;

0:05:50.747,0:05:53.940
even if I was scared I didn't hesitate in doing things.

0:05:53.940,0:05:56.300
So I would disarm and have a gun

0:05:56.300,0:06:00.040
but my mum didn't know anything,
 she thought I was just a good boy.

0:06:00.040,0:06:02.280
She can tell you, I was just a good boy.

0:06:02.280,0:06:06.140
Everything was just sweet and 
stuff like that.

0:06:06.140,0:06:10.890
Sometimes I would be in 
prison - in and out -

0:06:10.890,0:06:13.540
I wouldn't even tell her. l could stay

0:06:13.540,0:06:17.540
in prison for two or three days,
 but I didn't tell her.

0:06:17.540,0:06:20.480
A couple of times - in and out, 
in and out and selling drugs.

0:06:20.480,0:06:26.010
She would hear that I was selling drugs

0:06:26.010,0:06:28.020
but she heard that at the later stage.

0:06:28.020,0:06:32.900
That's when I was actually in the university.

0:06:32.900,0:06:34.620
Because I graduated from varsity as well

0:06:34.620,0:06:38.220
and after graduating from varsity,

0:06:38.220,0:06:41.220
that's when I was older and I got a car.

0:06:41.220,0:06:45.580
And even when I bought a car,
 I told her: "Mama, I bought a car."

0:06:45.580,0:06:47.380
But she didn't know that the car was stolen.

0:06:47.389,0:06:50.460
But I told her that I bought a car, 
and she knew that I bought a car.

0:06:50.460,0:06:53.427
I would come to her, she would help 
me with money

0:06:53.427,0:06:55.620
and things like that.

0:06:55.620,0:06:58.580
I would go back and spend it
 the way I spent it.

0:06:58.580,0:07:02.620
Okay, so you said from the 
robbery using both knives and guns,

0:07:02.620,0:07:05.154
you now graduated also to stealing cars.

0:07:05.160,0:07:08.160
Can you explain how you would
 go about that?

0:07:08.160,0:07:12.860
Well, stealing cars like it was with the guns and knives -

0:07:12.860,0:07:15.294
we would go for vulnerable people, we would go

0:07:15.300,0:07:18.060
for places where people don't know us.

0:07:18.060,0:07:19.620
For instance we would go for a neighborhood

0:07:19.620,0:07:21.840
where they didn't even know us.

0:07:21.840,0:07:24.400
We would just go there in the 
morning and we would go and rob -

0:07:24.400,0:07:27.220
maybe like a drunk guy in a pub

0:07:27.220,0:07:28.960
who is about to go to his car.

0:07:28.963,0:07:34.140
So as he is going to his car, 
we just pop up and just take him

0:07:34.140,0:07:37.300
put him in a boat and go to him in a boat, tie him up.

0:07:37.300,0:07:42.220
We take a car and just park it somewhere
 in a mall for the whole day

0:07:42.220,0:07:45.420
and just leave it there. We stand away

0:07:45.420,0:07:47.780
just looking at the car for the cops to come through.

0:07:47.780,0:07:51.430
After one day or two days without
 cops then we know that it is not bad.

0:07:51.430,0:07:53.700
By then there were no these things of trackers

0:07:53.700,0:07:54.974
and things like that.

0:07:54.980,0:07:59.140
So it was easy for us to get cars.

0:07:59.140,0:08:02.860
Our brother is giving this confession 
to confirm that word of prophecy

0:08:02.860,0:08:06.280
he received last week that he
 was involved in a life of crime.

0:08:06.280,0:08:08.919
And he's saying that what he is confessing right now

0:08:08.919,0:08:11.326
his mother is actually hearing
 it for the first time.

0:08:11.326,0:08:13.900
Because when you went back
 to your house you would pretend,

0:08:13.900,0:08:17.360
you would be a good boy in the 
house involving yourself in various chores.

0:08:17.360,0:08:19.511
But your mum would not be knowing that outside

0:08:19.520,0:08:23.040
you were living this very criminal lifestyle, is that right?

0:08:23.040,0:08:28.440
Yes, sir. My mum didn't know about the 
criminal lifestyle that I was living.

0:08:28.440,0:08:36.600
And I think it was after when things
 got really bad for me.

0:08:36.600,0:08:39.060
Because at some time I was in and out of prison

0:08:39.070,0:08:40.449
but there was a point when I was in prison

0:08:40.449,0:08:45.000
and I thought I had some previous things that
 I did and have been in prison.

0:08:45.000,0:08:46.940
So me being in prison this time -

0:08:46.940,0:08:49.398
they would actually bring back my file and

0:08:49.398,0:08:52.149
see that I had previous things that I did in my life,

0:08:52.149,0:08:54.740
so I had to go for a longer period at that time.

0:08:54.740,0:08:57.760
That's when I went to prison and being in prison

0:08:57.760,0:09:01.200
I had to learn the ways of surviving,

0:09:01.200,0:09:04.700
so I had to study ways of having tattoos,

0:09:04.700,0:09:07.560
my first tattoos was having it in prison.

0:09:07.560,0:09:13.320
Having RAF3 tattoos, having 
it right at the bottom of my legs.

0:09:13.320,0:09:17.180
And then I had to know how to survive there inside

0:09:17.180,0:09:24.440
being a cleaner, having food and things
 like roll on, lotions, weed, cigarettes.

0:09:24.440,0:09:28.420
So I had access to these things since
 I was in the passage being a cleaner.

0:09:28.420,0:09:31.820
So that's when I was introduced into doing tattoos.

0:09:31.820,0:09:36.120
But then, that love of tattoos came from 
the time when I studied from Fine Arts at school,

0:09:36.120,0:09:40.440
I used to do fine arts, conceptual study,
 History of art and things like that.

0:09:40.440,0:09:42.470
We just want you to explain that aspect

0:09:42.470,0:09:46.220
in prison very clearly - you said, when 
you were in prison, you found a way of

0:09:46.220,0:09:48.560
getting things of surviving in prison.

0:09:48.560,0:09:51.280
Can you tell us, was there a form of initiation

0:09:51.280,0:09:53.575
into a certain gang whilst you were there in prison

0:09:53.580,0:09:57.060
or how did you find your way in 
prison to have such things?

0:09:57.060,0:09:59.400
Yeah, there are rules in prison.

0:09:59.400,0:10:01.720
There was a paper that they pluck
 at the back of the door

0:10:01.720,0:10:02.800
when you go in.

0:10:02.800,0:10:04.801
It's like they don't force you to join the gang;

0:10:04.801,0:10:06.760
they don't force you to be a member of a gang.

0:10:06.760,0:10:09.560
But there are rules that if you have any complains,

0:10:09.560,0:10:11.722
if they come in a morning and come to you,

0:10:11.722,0:10:14.360
if you have any complains, you can tell the waders

0:10:14.360,0:10:17.720
that these guys are troubling me or this guy did this.

0:10:17.720,0:10:20.920
but then I had ways to get things,
 I had sheets, I had roll on

0:10:20.920,0:10:22.700
and I had Colgate.

0:10:22.700,0:10:25.880
These are the essentials, very
 important that you need in jail.

0:10:25.880,0:10:29.460
So if the new guys come in they would clean for us

0:10:29.460,0:10:32.940
and if they need something
 out, they exchange for that.

0:10:32.940,0:10:35.880
And that's when I really saw that I needed my mum,

0:10:35.880,0:10:38.400
and that's when I called her.

0:10:38.400,0:10:41.220
And she came through, she always came through

0:10:41.220,0:10:43.960
and we cried together.

0:10:43.960,0:10:46.180
And you know, I didn't like the life

0:10:46.180,0:10:52.080
I was living because like I said I
 have two brothers that I left at home.

0:10:52.080,0:10:56.220
Okay, so our brother is explaining
 because of this lifestyle,

0:10:56.220,0:10:59.040
he was going in and out of prison.

0:10:59.040,0:11:02.240
And he was actually in prison for a long time as a

0:11:02.240,0:11:04.520
result of the activities he was involved in.

0:11:04.520,0:11:07.280
And brother, can you just explain
 to us, even after coming out of prison,

0:11:07.280,0:11:11.480
would you find you still going back 
to those same criminal activities

0:11:11.480,0:11:13.500
to get money even after being in prison

0:11:13.500,0:11:15.840
and served a prison sentence?

0:11:15.840,0:11:18.080
Yeah, it was not easy because you know these things you do,

0:11:18.080,0:11:22.080
you often find a sense of belonging.

0:11:22.080,0:11:25.320
So I tried so many things even in prison,

0:11:25.320,0:11:29.440
I tried joining the Islam or
 study Hari krishna.

0:11:29.440,0:11:32.780
At some point I was a Rasta, I smoked weed

0:11:32.780,0:11:36.020
and sold drugs - a whole lot of drugs.

0:11:36.020,0:11:41.400
So there was a way that I would 
often go back and bounce back to that.

0:11:41.400,0:11:44.080
Because even when I came back out of prison

0:11:44.080,0:11:46.619
I found that people came into my house

0:11:46.620,0:11:49.680
and told me that they needed drugs.

0:11:49.680,0:11:53.660
So having a lot of people come into
 my house that they needed drugs,

0:11:53.660,0:11:57.880
I saw an opportunity that maybe I
 should go back and have these things.

0:11:57.880,0:12:00.880
And then I had drugs and then at some point

0:12:00.880,0:12:02.498
I was working through the canvas and

0:12:02.500,0:12:04.380
I would travel a whole lot of places

0:12:04.380,0:12:07.360
and I got hold of having the professional machines

0:12:07.360,0:12:09.160
of doing like tattoos.

0:12:09.160,0:12:12.080
Since I learned that in prison of doing tattoos

0:12:12.080,0:12:14.734
and knowing that I was good in
 drawing and doing these things

0:12:14.740,0:12:16.820
then I bought these tattoos kits

0:12:16.820,0:12:20.600
and I was a tattoo artist at some point.

0:12:20.600,0:12:23.400
Okay, was there ever a time after coming out of prison

0:12:23.400,0:12:26.780
that you involved yourself in an 
operation whereby you're actually

0:12:26.780,0:12:29.420
almost caught or you were sustained an injury

0:12:29.420,0:12:33.480
in the process of robbery operation
 that you were undergoing?

0:12:33.480,0:12:35.880
Yeah, I would call that the biggest turn of my life

0:12:35.880,0:12:38.820
because there are certain things 
that happened in my life

0:12:38.820,0:12:40.760
that, like they call it 'karma'.

0:12:40.760,0:12:44.320
Like you do bad things and bad things will follow you.

0:12:44.320,0:12:47.360
So there are certain things that
 I did that they happened to me

0:12:47.360,0:12:52.580
and when they happened, it was not a surprise to me.

0:12:52.580,0:12:56.980
Because I used to rob people and I was once robbed.

0:12:56.980,0:13:00.180
I used to have guns and I was once shot.

0:13:00.180,0:13:03.299
You know, like being shot; like right now

0:13:03.300,0:13:06.160
I got my ankle is actually fused.

0:13:06.160,0:13:08.680
And this is the first time that my 
mum will be hearing this

0:13:08.680,0:13:10.880
from here because even when I told her,

0:13:10.880,0:13:12.700
I told her a different story.

0:13:12.700,0:13:14.407
But this is the first time that she hears.

0:13:14.407,0:13:19.020
I was actually involved in a robbery
 with a few guys.

0:13:19.020,0:13:22.220
We actually went and robbed the
 other guy for his van

0:13:22.220,0:13:26.180
and a couple of cell phones and a 
couple of laptops in a basement.

0:13:26.180,0:13:28.740
It was around Johannesburg in oriental plaza.

0:13:28.740,0:13:35.080
We robbed the guy - it was 2008.
 I think it was on a 23rd of March.

0:13:35.080,0:13:40.320
We were three guys, I had a gun with me by then.

0:13:40.320,0:13:43.860
This other guys had guns but they 
needed more guns to go and do the job,

0:13:43.860,0:13:46.060
so they called me and we went there.

0:13:46.060,0:13:48.760
Right when we went there we took the 
car and we took everything,

0:13:48.760,0:13:50.340
we took the money, I took the money on me,

0:13:50.340,0:13:52.640
I had everything on account on me,

0:13:52.640,0:13:54.200
and the other guy just shot.

0:13:54.200,0:13:56.740
He made a shot, he shot the other guy on the leg -

0:13:56.740,0:13:59.840
the guy who was there, whom we robbed.

0:13:59.840,0:14:01.840
And then there was a sound of a gun

0:14:01.840,0:14:04.540
and there were the security guards around the area.

0:14:04.540,0:14:07.750
And there were cops and there was a chase,

0:14:07.750,0:14:12.620
they chased us and then we actually 
left the car on the road

0:14:12.620,0:14:15.480
and we ran - everybody went his own way.

0:14:15.480,0:14:20.120
And then they chased me, the security 
guard who was chasing me - behind me

0:14:20.120,0:14:25.140
and the other friends of mine - I don't 
know if they were ever get caught or what.

0:14:25.140,0:14:28.720
The other guy who was chasing me
 with a motorbike, I was having a gun -

0:14:28.720,0:14:32.280
I pointed him with a gun and he
 actually moved away from me.

0:14:32.280,0:14:36.700
And then right there, when I was
 running, I took a ride and I saw a flat.

0:14:36.700,0:14:41.080
It was next to the oriental mall Plaza flat,
 I went in that mall.

0:14:41.080,0:14:43.800
Not in a mall, in a flat; I went into a flat

0:14:43.800,0:14:47.500
and I went in and I just closed the door there by the flat.

0:14:47.500,0:14:49.500
Right there when I closed the door by the flat,

0:14:49.510,0:14:54.850
there was a door and at the bottom
 of the door there was a glass there.

0:14:54.850,0:15:00.660
So I just closed and I sat there, 
and I closed the door with my leg.

0:15:00.660,0:15:03.380
And then I sat there and they thought 
probably I have just passed

0:15:03.380,0:15:06.080
because I saw them, a few of them passing through.

0:15:06.080,0:15:08.380
But right then there was a guy who just came in,

0:15:08.380,0:15:11.800
I think the guy who stayed in the
 same flat that I was in,

0:15:11.800,0:15:14.040
because I found a door open -

0:15:14.050,0:15:15.800
I was the one who closed the door.

0:15:15.800,0:15:18.680
So the guy who was staying there
 wanted to push the door

0:15:18.680,0:15:21.780
for him to enter in a flat and I was there,

0:15:21.780,0:15:26.860
and he saw that there were 
cops around and then he leaned a bit

0:15:26.860,0:15:30.360
and he saw me. Right when he saw 
me, that's when he told her cops:

0:15:30.370,0:15:32.350
"Okay, the guy is there".

0:15:32.350,0:15:34.180
I heard him say the guy is there.

0:15:34.180,0:15:37.480
I tried to run but I had a shot.

0:15:37.480,0:15:39.635
Then that's when they shot me on an ankle

0:15:39.640,0:15:42.740
and I ran, I ran, I dragged myself, I dragged myself.

0:15:42.740,0:15:46.960
Just next to the building there was a 
Mosque, it was around 5 o'clock.

0:15:46.960,0:15:49.860
I think that was a time where 
they were about to start service,

0:15:49.867,0:15:52.340
so I went in there, I dragged myself,

0:15:52.340,0:15:54.860
I took my gun, I put it in a jacket.
 I wrapped it with a jacket.

0:15:54.860,0:15:58.420
I wrapped my leg, but when I looked
 at my leg - it was wobbling.

0:15:58.420,0:15:59.800
I felt like...

0:15:59.800,0:16:06.080
It was my first encounter of being shot, 
so I felt like my feet was going to...

0:16:06.080,0:16:07.980
I felt that was a terrible pain.

0:16:07.980,0:16:09.940
It is was really drastic.

0:16:09.940,0:16:13.740
So I dragged myself and sat
 behind the door at the mosque.

0:16:13.740,0:16:16.960
So they were passing through. Inside the mosque,

0:16:16.960,0:16:18.130
there's was a  guy who is singing on top

0:16:18.130,0:16:19.540
and they just passed him through.

0:16:19.540,0:16:22.920
So I kept on asking for water
 from these guys

0:16:22.920,0:16:25.240
and I drank a lot of water.

0:16:25.240,0:16:29.560
And at this point your foot was
 heavily bleeding from the gunshots?

0:16:29.560,0:16:32.469
Yes, I was heavily bleeding, that was the reason

0:16:32.469,0:16:34.380
I took a jacket and wrapped my leg with a jacket

0:16:34.380,0:16:36.910
for them not to see the jacket; so 
they probably thought it was a

0:16:36.910,0:16:37.749
begger or something.

0:16:37.749,0:16:40.840
So they gave me some water, some
 of them just passed me there.

0:16:40.840,0:16:44.340
But then it was a time for the
 service to end, then they went out.

0:16:44.350,0:16:46.690
And I went out and I dragged myself,

0:16:46.690,0:16:49.900
by then it was around quarter past six.

0:16:49.900,0:16:52.000
I'm not sure but it was past 6 in the afternoon.

0:16:52.000,0:16:55.320
I dragged myself and sat just outside the building -

0:16:55.320,0:16:57.480
there was a place  where I could hide myself;

0:16:57.480,0:16:59.020
I just hid myself there.

0:16:59.020,0:17:05.940
Next to that mosque was another
 building where there was a

0:17:05.940,0:17:10.200
motorbike fix store; there were 
other guys who were fixing motorcycles.

0:17:10.200,0:17:12.600
I think these guys were coming for a night shift.

0:17:12.600,0:17:16.080
So they came in there, and when
 they went in, they saw me there.

0:17:16.089,0:17:18.400
And they asked me: "What's happening?"

0:17:18.400,0:17:20.880
and I told them - I lied to them again -

0:17:20.890,0:17:25.270
I told them: "No! I was robbed and I was shot,
 Please, I need help?

0:17:25.270,0:17:26.880
Can you call ambulance for me?"

0:17:26.880,0:17:30.820
But the other guy told me: "No, aren't 
you the guy who was there around?"

0:17:30.820,0:17:33.540
Because he saw actually there were cops around.

0:17:33.540,0:17:36.880
So by then I couldn't lie, so I told him: "Yes,

0:17:36.887,0:17:40.039
I am the guy, and I pulled out cash from my pockets.

0:17:40.039,0:17:44.028
I think I pulled out three thousand or something."

0:17:44.029,0:17:45.289
I gave them all the money I had,

0:17:45.289,0:17:50.700
I told them: "I am the guy, please, can 
you help me and call me ambulance?"

0:17:50.700,0:17:55.380
And I stayed there till the ambulance
 came around 12 o'clock at midnight.

0:17:55.380,0:17:58.260
Then the ambulance took me, I went
to Helen Joseph's Hospital.

0:17:58.260,0:18:00.900
Right there in Helen Joseph's Hospital 
they came with a scissors,

0:18:00.900,0:18:03.700
they tried to cut my clothing and all that

0:18:03.700,0:18:07.060
because I was heavily bleeding, but
I got a chance - I took a gun again,

0:18:07.060,0:18:10.420
I hid it with my jacket, I put it right there

0:18:10.420,0:18:12.152
where my clothing and my belonging can be -

0:18:12.152,0:18:14.839
in like a small cabinet just next to my bed.

0:18:14.840,0:18:18.980
And I went to theater and I came 
back. When I came back,

0:18:18.980,0:18:23.660
I found a gun was still there, and
 I stayed there and I called my girlfriend.

0:18:23.660,0:18:28.460
I have two kids with my wife,
 I was staying with her then.

0:18:28.460,0:18:32.100
I called her to come and get the gun.

0:18:32.100,0:18:36.560
She came and got the gun from the place.

0:18:36.560,0:18:40.257
Okay, so we're listening to this 
life experience of our brother.

0:18:40.257,0:18:42.889
He said during one of these robbery operations

0:18:42.889,0:18:44.820
he was actually shot in the ankle

0:18:44.820,0:18:47.574
and taken to hospital and he actually lied there

0:18:47.574,0:18:49.429
that he had been attacked whereas

0:18:49.429,0:18:52.700
he was actually the one involved in 
the robbery operation.

0:18:52.700,0:18:56.100
And brother, how long were you in 
the hospital as a result of this

0:18:56.100,0:18:58.360
gunshots in your ankle?

0:18:58.360,0:19:01.620
I stayed in the hospital for about nine months.

0:19:01.620,0:19:04.849
Because you actually had to go through like operations.

0:19:04.849,0:19:07.600
I think I had to go for three operations.

0:19:07.600,0:19:09.500
But my mom used to come through and visit me there,

0:19:09.500,0:19:12.860
and she was a believer, she would pray for me.

0:19:12.860,0:19:16.519
Well, there were evangelists and 
people who would pray for me around there.

0:19:16.519,0:19:18.470
But I wouldn't want to listen to
 them because I was fed up.

0:19:18.470,0:19:20.500
But I didn't know I was angry at God, I asked God:

0:19:20.500,0:19:24.460
"Why did You do this to me, I'm a good boy.

0:19:24.460,0:19:27.840
I'm a first graduate and all this,
 why are You doing this to me?"

0:19:27.840,0:19:30.380
So I was just fed up, I didn't want to hear prayers.

0:19:30.380,0:19:32.820
But when she came through - "she" is my mum -

0:19:32.820,0:19:35.740
when she came, I would listen to her and she would pray for me.

0:19:35.740,0:19:39.220
Okay, so as our brother said earlier 
our mother is actually hearing

0:19:39.220,0:19:42.180
the truth behind this incident for the first time.

0:19:42.180,0:19:45.920
She was under the impression that her
 son was attacked in a robbery operation.

0:19:45.920,0:19:48.520
Hence the gun wound on his leg whereas today

0:19:48.520,0:19:52.120
he's confessing for the first time 
that he was actually the one who

0:19:52.120,0:19:53.980
perpetrated robbery operation.

0:19:53.980,0:19:58.280
So brother even after you came out
 from hospital with this injury to your

0:19:58.280,0:20:01.100
ankle - did this mean you still continued this life of

0:20:01.100,0:20:03.820
selling drugs and these criminal activities?

0:20:03.820,0:20:07.400
It was a turning point because I felt 
like there was nothing I could do.

0:20:07.400,0:20:09.940
I used to skate, I used to play basketball,

0:20:09.940,0:20:14.180
I'm an artist so I needed to climb 
stairs and things like that,

0:20:14.180,0:20:16.120
so my leg was very important to me.

0:20:16.120,0:20:20.320
But to me, I asked myself like: "What next?"

0:20:20.320,0:20:23.907
I thought that maybe I would die, 
if I do something else - I would die.

0:20:23.907,0:20:27.020
But I bounced back, I went back to the neighborhood,

0:20:27.020,0:20:29.640
I went back to selling drugs again.

0:20:29.640,0:20:33.780
But then I sold drugs, and then 
I continued doing  tattoos again.

0:20:33.780,0:20:36.080
But I still had a gun with me again.

0:20:36.080,0:20:41.220
Okay, so now you said that you actually
 became a tattoo artist, that you learned

0:20:41.220,0:20:46.680
about tattoos whilst you're in prison. 
Could you just explain to us

0:20:46.680,0:20:50.460
more about the tattoos that you put all over your body?

0:20:50.460,0:20:52.900
I would do tattoos - I don't know,
 if maybe I could show you?

0:20:52.900,0:21:00.560
Tebogo & Mother - Prophecy Testimony

0:21:00.560,0:21:05.900
So our brother is explaining that he actually 
put tattoos across his entire body.

0:21:05.900,0:21:08.700
As he said, he was a tattoo artist.

0:21:08.700,0:21:12.380
And this is exactly as the man of God 
prophesied in the word of prophecy -

0:21:12.380,0:21:15.280
he said, there's a brother there that 
has tattoos all over his body,

0:21:15.280,0:21:17.480
And this is what we're seeing now.

0:21:17.480,0:21:21.600
So just tell his brother,  what prompted you to be doing such?

0:21:21.600,0:21:23.960
Well, my tattoo was...

0:21:23.960,0:21:25.659
Like I said, I was angry at God,

0:21:25.659,0:21:27.969
there's a whole lot of things that happened to me

0:21:27.969,0:21:29.289
and I was angry at God, hence

0:21:29.289,0:21:31.665
I did a Lord's prayer on my cheek.

0:21:31.665,0:21:33.609
I did some wings on my neck,

0:21:33.609,0:21:37.640
I did a whole lot of tattoos all over my body.

0:21:37.640,0:21:39.760
And I came back. When I came back,

0:21:39.760,0:21:41.914
I continued selling drugs.

0:21:41.914,0:21:45.640
And then something happened to
 me again. At some certain point

0:21:45.640,0:21:48.560
I was with my girlfriend, she 
bought a car and I was chilling just

0:21:48.560,0:21:51.200
next to my house at the front of my gate.

0:21:51.200,0:21:53.500
And I was hijacked.

0:21:53.500,0:21:56.140
They actually tried to hijack us, me and my girlfriend.

0:21:56.140,0:22:00.040
There were four guys who wanted 
to hijack and I was nabbed six times.

0:22:00.040,0:22:03.480
And I stayed in prison, I was knifed right here,

0:22:03.480,0:22:05.600
in the middle of my throat.

0:22:05.600,0:22:11.580
And I was knifed here on my nerve.
 I was knifed here in the middle.

0:22:11.580,0:22:15.200
I think, at the back... And she knows 
and she came through again.

0:22:15.200,0:22:17.041
She prayed for me right there again.

0:22:17.041,0:22:20.300
So what you were doing to others 
now actually happened to you

0:22:20.300,0:22:22.720
and you were attempted to hijack your car,

0:22:22.720,0:22:27.320
and you were stabbed six times with a 
knife when you're with your girlfriend?

0:22:27.320,0:22:30.560
So what you were doing to others 
now came back and happen to you?

0:22:30.560,0:22:32.660
Yes, sir.

0:22:32.660,0:22:36.860
So can you just tell us, so today to the
 glory of God, we can actually see you

0:22:36.860,0:22:39.980
standing in the presence of God with your mom 
here the Synagogue Church of All Nations.

0:22:39.987,0:22:40.819
Could you just tell us,

0:22:40.820,0:22:45.480
how did it happen that you came to be here in the Synagogue Church of All Nations today?

0:22:45.480,0:22:47.860
Well, I used to be in denial. Actually she's a believer,

0:22:47.860,0:22:51.320
she always her she always prayed,

0:22:51.320,0:22:52.580
whenever I came through.

0:22:52.580,0:22:54.640
I don't know how she knew that

0:22:54.640,0:22:58.080
but every time I came through and was 
about to leave the house,

0:22:58.080,0:23:00.920
she used to pray for me, and she gave me some

0:23:00.920,0:23:04.480
TB Joshua's books to go and read at home.

0:23:04.480,0:23:06.349
And every time I came back she asked me:

0:23:06.349,0:23:07.348
"Did you read those books?"

0:23:07.348,0:23:08.760
But I started to read those books

0:23:08.760,0:23:11.560
and I started to read the books.

0:23:11.560,0:23:14.539
And that right then, I met someone - while she was praying for me -

0:23:14.540,0:23:18.000
I met someone in the hospital before I got discharged,

0:23:18.000,0:23:23.580
who actually told me that I should actually 
tell my story to someone in order for me to get healed.

0:23:23.580,0:23:26.660
So that's how I got here.

0:23:26.660,0:23:32.500
Okay, can you explain, when your 
mum initially introduced you

0:23:32.500,0:23:33.919
to the Synagogue Church for All Nations, Emmanuel TV,

0:23:33.920,0:23:39.180
what was your reaction initially 
when she introduced you to these things?

0:23:39.180,0:23:41.380
I didn't believe it at all.

0:23:41.380,0:23:45.540
So I would watch it,  I mean would
 watch Emmanuel TV the whole day.

0:23:45.540,0:23:47.480
And she knows,  I would complain to her.

0:23:47.480,0:23:51.560
And when she went out, I would change the channel and watch some other things.

0:23:51.560,0:23:53.620
And when she came back, we 
would watch Emmanuel TV.

0:23:53.629,0:23:58.248
But I would ask her: "Are we going 
to watch this thing the whole day?"

0:23:58.248,0:24:00.120
Those were the things I would say to her.

0:24:00.120,0:24:04.300
But now I do, we sit together and we watch it on video.

0:24:04.300,0:24:05.980
Okay, so initially you were....

0:24:05.980,0:24:09.480
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:24:09.480,0:24:13.700
So initially you were very skeptical, 
but your mum kept persisting

0:24:13.700,0:24:16.080
and encouraging you. And what finally,

0:24:16.080,0:24:18.940
maybe there was something you 
saw on Emmanuel TV or experience

0:24:18.940,0:24:22.800
you had that finally convinced you 
that you too should come here?

0:24:22.800,0:24:25.380
Well, she's the one who actually shone the light on me,

0:24:25.380,0:24:28.260
she told me: "I know you, I gave birth to you,

0:24:28.270,0:24:31.270
I know you are a good boy, and I miss that good boy in you."

0:24:31.270,0:24:34.040
You know, so that thing would make me very sad.

0:24:34.040,0:24:38.040
Because I wanted to see her smile, 
I wanted to make her proud.

0:24:38.040,0:24:42.360
So immediately when I saw that...
 I looked at myself, and I was like full of tattoos.

0:24:42.370,0:24:43.640
So I would ask myself...

0:24:43.640,0:24:47.220
And she told me, because she used
 to come here and come back.

0:24:47.220,0:24:50.720
And she told me: "I've been to the
 Synagogue Church of All Nations,

0:24:50.720,0:24:53.720
It's beautiful, there is power there, 
you should come through there".

0:24:53.720,0:25:00.220
But I'd ask her how would they accept
 a guy like me - I am full of tattoos?

0:25:00.220,0:25:02.840
I meant how could I enter in the Lord's house?

0:25:02.840,0:25:07.900
So I was a full of hesitation 
and in denial of that.

0:25:07.900,0:25:10.731
So you thought that you would not 
be accepted in the church

0:25:10.740,0:25:14.080
because of your appearance with
 the tattoos all over your body?

0:25:14.080,0:25:16.540
Indeed, but then it happened differently.

0:25:16.540,0:25:20.600
Even if I was in denial,

0:25:20.600,0:25:23.460
but at some point I was tired of the street,

0:25:23.460,0:25:27.600
I wanted to make her happy - she was 
always crying.

0:25:27.600,0:25:32.680
When I met her, she was not having
 a smile and I missed that from her.

0:25:32.680,0:25:36.600
She was my best friend of all,
you should see us in the house.

0:25:36.609,0:25:42.440
She's the best. So I missed
 that, so then I actually told her,

0:25:42.440,0:25:44.960
one day I told her that...

0:25:44.960,0:25:48.240
She told me that we should go 
and I told her I want to go.

0:25:48.241,0:25:52.960
And she thought I was lying, and 
I told her: "Yes, I am going to go".

0:25:52.960,0:25:57.400
She gave me money to go and do my passport

0:25:57.400,0:26:03.220
I ate the money, and she called 
me again, and I didn't answer her calls.

0:26:03.220,0:26:06.280
But after some time I answered her call again,

0:26:06.280,0:26:10.380
and I agreed to come through here 
and then we came in here.

0:26:10.380,0:26:16.800
But right at the airport - I was having tattoos
 all over my body and I was wearing a t-shirt.

0:26:16.800,0:26:20.960
This our mother who was
 our coordinater actually gave us T-shirt:

0:26:20.960,0:26:24.700
'My love is in heaven' with a big red heart,

0:26:24.700,0:26:29.280
and I was having tattoos all over my body,

0:26:29.280,0:26:31.400
so I felt like this is a contradiction.

0:26:31.400,0:26:34.340
I would look at people around me,
how they were looking at me in the airport

0:26:34.340,0:26:36.880
and in the plane and things like that.

0:26:36.880,0:26:39.660
But when you finally arrived, just tell
 us what you experienced

0:26:39.660,0:26:43.060
when you came down to the church?

0:26:43.060,0:26:47.680
What I experienced here is something
 I've never experienced in my life.

0:26:47.680,0:26:49.720
Because when I came here,

0:26:49.720,0:26:52.390
the guy who came to collect us from the airport -

0:26:52.390,0:26:55.800
he drove there, when I just came in.

0:26:55.800,0:26:58.440
He just gave me a hand and said: "Yes sir, how are you?"

0:26:58.440,0:27:00.920
And that was the first thing - I've never been called 'sir'.

0:27:00.920,0:27:04.180
He just said: "Yes sir, how are you sir?" 
I was like: "I'm good".

0:27:04.180,0:27:07.820
But I was still  bitter, he sai: "Good morning!"

0:27:07.820,0:27:11.520
I didn't answer him because I didn't
 know what he meant.

0:27:11.520,0:27:17.360
So we came together with him, 
but the guy didn't even ask me about my tattoos,

0:27:17.360,0:27:21.720
he didn't even look at me funnily
 and I still meet him even now.

0:27:21.720,0:27:24.360
So you saw the initial love and acceptance

0:27:24.360,0:27:27.660
and then when you came down to the church - just tell us, what happened

0:27:27.660,0:27:31.000
as you arrived here at the church 
and when you came to the Sunday service?

0:27:31.000,0:27:36.920
When I arrived in church, they showed
 us the place where we should go to sleep.

0:27:36.920,0:27:39.171
But I would stay there where we just sleep.

0:27:39.180,0:27:43.200
I wouldn't come here to church, I would just stay there.

0:27:43.200,0:27:46.270
But there were people who were 
still looking at me in a different way.

0:27:46.270,0:27:51.440
But you know, I didn't know but
 when I came here -

0:27:51.440,0:27:55.860
we would sit in a dining room, we would discuss,

0:27:55.860,0:28:00.100
we would look at people
 and hear testimonies on TV -

0:28:00.100,0:28:03.306
that I thought I was the worst, 
but when I looked at other testimonies,

0:28:03.306,0:28:08.560
that's when I felt like...

0:28:08.560,0:28:11.220
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ,

0:28:11.220,0:28:14.700
that's how the testimonies of others 
really inspired our brother.

0:28:14.700,0:28:18.660
And brother, on Sunday we witnessed 
the clip as you sat down at the church

0:28:18.660,0:28:22.360
and the man of God gave that prophecy - 
can you describe what happened

0:28:22.360,0:28:26.980
on that day when you received the prophecy 
and ever since then the changes in your life?}

0:28:26.980,0:28:30.100
Well, I was still in denial because
 even when he called me,

0:28:30.100,0:28:33.820
the other evangelist sister...

0:28:33.820,0:28:37.320
Prophet TB Joshua came and touched me.

0:28:37.320,0:28:40.440
But you know, due to I was still
 in denial nothing happened.

0:28:40.440,0:28:45.060
I just stood there, he touched me but I
 was still in denial because I didn't know what was happening.

0:28:45.060,0:28:47.400
I was confused about what was happening around.

0:28:47.400,0:28:52.580
You know, but then when these things happened, when he called me out,

0:28:52.580,0:28:58.160
nobody knew about my life, and he when he said that,

0:28:58.160,0:29:04.740
I just came out because I really felt it.

0:29:04.740,0:29:08.620
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:29:08.620,0:29:11.280
And to the glory of God, brother - it has 
been one week now,

0:29:11.280,0:29:16.100
ever since that encounter, what are the
 changes you've experienced in your life?

0:29:16.100,0:29:19.980
I have experienced love, tolerance.

0:29:19.980,0:29:23.780
As a youth, you have to live like a life of a movie,

0:29:23.780,0:29:27.500
and when you're watching a movie
 at the end of the movie not nice.

0:29:27.500,0:29:30.040
So I was living like that, but when I came here,

0:29:30.040,0:29:36.339
I would go to Bible classes, meet 
people around, everybody greets...

0:29:36.340,0:29:41.020
You go to sleep, nobody steals,
 but nobody is told not to steal.

0:29:41.020,0:29:44.740
Things like that, those are the
 things that matter to me most.

0:29:44.740,0:29:47.700
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:29:47.700,0:29:52.860
So you're now living a completely 
new life. That spirit that was disturbing you

0:29:52.860,0:29:57.680
to rob, to steal, to take drugs,
 sell drugs has completely gone.

0:29:57.680,0:30:03.240
Yes, I can really confess now
 and say that Jesus Christ is my Savior.

0:30:03.240,0:30:09.900
Tebogo & Mother - Prophecy Testimony

0:30:09.900,0:30:15.180
I used to think that I could be saved 
by certain things, but it's all vanity.

0:30:15.180,0:30:18.180
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:30:18.180,0:30:23.100
And brother, we know that your past is over 
and you're completely out of your past life.

0:30:23.110,0:30:25.900
For the glory of God, you mentioned
 earlier that you actually have tattoos

0:30:25.900,0:30:29.349
all over your body could you just
 actually show us clearly the extend

0:30:29.440,0:30:33.240
of those tattoos all over your body,
 so people can really see

0:30:33.240,0:30:35.200
what the Lord has done for you?

0:30:35.200,0:30:40.860
Tebogo & Mother - Prophecy Testimony

0:30:40.860,0:30:44.440
So once again, we're just showing this so that people of God

0:30:44.440,0:30:48.720
can understand what Jesus Christ
 has really delivered our brother from

0:30:48.720,0:30:51.340
that life he was living. And he said earlier

0:30:51.340,0:30:53.260
that as someone with tattoos all 
over his body

0:30:53.260,0:30:57.600
he felt that he would not actually
 be accepted in the church environment.

0:30:57.600,0:30:59.500
He felt she would be looked down upon

0:30:59.500,0:31:03.800
or condemned because of his appearance.

0:31:03.800,0:31:05.120
But to the glory of God when he arrived at the Synagogue Church of All Nations. What he

0:31:05.120,0:31:08.820
experienced was love, acceptance and care.

0:31:08.820,0:31:14.400
And that really touched him, for 
him to have seen such a reception

0:31:14.400,0:31:18.600
in the house of God and as a result, when 
the word of prophecy came forth,

0:31:18.600,0:31:22.100
he realized that what the man of God said was something he had never told anyone.

0:31:22.100,0:31:25.500
He has never disclosed his past 
life even to his own mother.

0:31:25.500,0:31:27.540
But when the word of prophecy came forth

0:31:27.550,0:31:29.620
that there's a man with tattoos all over his body

0:31:29.620,0:31:31.600
who was a criminal that touched his heart.

0:31:31.600,0:31:34.599
He came forward and ever since
 then to the glory of God

0:31:34.600,0:31:38.520
he has been completely free from
 that spirit that was disturbing him,

0:31:38.520,0:31:42.400
pushing him and to crime and pushing
 him into taking drugs, selling drugs,

0:31:42.400,0:31:44.700
armed robbery and today he's a new man.

0:31:44.700,0:31:47.360
Let's but I have together for
 Jesus Christ one more time.

0:31:47.360,0:31:52.300
Tebogo & Mother - Prophecy Testimony

0:31:52.300,0:31:54.960
So once again, we're just showing
 this so that people of God

0:31:54.960,0:31:59.460
can really understand the extent of 
what Jesus Christ has done

0:31:59.460,0:32:04.620
for our brother, and we give all the 
glory to God that today he is free.

0:32:04.620,0:32:08.680
Jesus Christ has set him free from 
that life that he was living before

0:32:08.680,0:32:12.300
and that spirit that was pushing
 him into such a life has completely

0:32:12.300,0:32:14.300
been cast out by our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:32:14.300,0:32:17.200
One more time, people, let's put our hands
 together for our Lord Jesus Christ!

0:32:17.200,0:32:22.840
Tebogo & Mother - Prophecy Testimony

0:32:22.840,0:32:27.420
Emmanuel!

0:32:27.420,0:32:30.300
People of God, my name is Regina Murake

0:32:30.300,0:32:35.640
and I'm from South Africa, I'm 57 years of age.

0:32:35.640,0:32:42.440
This is my son Tebogo, he is quite a charming boy.

0:32:42.440,0:32:46.020
He was quite a charming boy when he grew up,

0:32:46.020,0:32:50.280
and it happened that because I was staying with...

0:32:50.280,0:32:54.080
The man that I was staying with was not his father.

0:32:54.080,0:32:57.560
So it happened that he grew up with my father.

0:32:57.560,0:33:01.580
That is why most of the things that he said I don't know.

0:33:01.580,0:33:05.240
But I made it a point that he would get everything that he wanted.

0:33:05.240,0:33:10.300
I used to go to my place,, to my
 father's place and buy food for him,

0:33:10.300,0:33:13.220
make sure that he goes to school and all that.

0:33:13.220,0:33:17.120
So the things that he said about
 several time being jailed -

0:33:17.120,0:33:20.820
I don't know about it - I only know about one incident.

0:33:20.820,0:33:24.880
That's when I went there and then I
 bailed him, he got out.

0:33:24.880,0:33:27.520
I tried to speak to him all the time.

0:33:27.520,0:33:32.460
When you speak to him, it is like
 he listens, he understands

0:33:32.470,0:33:36.070
but immediately he goes away,
 he does his own things there

0:33:36.070,0:33:38.780
which I didn't know. Actually, I
 knew that there was something

0:33:38.780,0:33:41.780
wrong that he was doing because there was a time

0:33:41.780,0:33:46.080
when I was talking to him and he said:

0:33:46.080,0:33:51.300
"Mom, I need time to live my life, let me live my life."

0:33:51.300,0:33:55.440
Because it was like I wanted him 
to live the way I want him to.

0:33:55.440,0:33:59.480
So I told him that it's okay: "But when things are not going

0:33:59.480,0:34:01.800
well with you remember that you've got a mother.

0:34:01.800,0:34:05.560
And I will always accept you and help you."

0:34:05.560,0:34:08.540
So he went away because he was not staying with me,

0:34:08.540,0:34:12.960
by then he was staying at my other brother's house.

0:34:12.960,0:34:17.280
So he was staying there with his girlfriend. All these things

0:34:17.280,0:34:19.800
started and happened whilst he was there

0:34:19.800,0:34:22.280
because he was at the university.

0:34:22.280,0:34:25.220
And then that's when I started to realize that

0:34:25.220,0:34:27.660
there was something wrong that he was doing

0:34:27.660,0:34:33.200
and I always told him that there was 
something that was not right with him.

0:34:33.200,0:34:36.040
Then it took quite a time that he didn't come to me

0:34:36.040,0:34:39.060
because he said he wanted to live his own life.

0:34:39.060,0:34:43.960
That time he came back he was full of tattoos,

0:34:43.960,0:34:50.940
I felt so bad because the first thing 
that he did it was that he was a Rastafarian.

0:34:50.940,0:34:54.340
He used to have big dreadlocks and those

0:34:54.340,0:34:56.960
dukes that they put a tie on their heads.

0:34:56.960,0:34:59.440
And I told him that I didn't like that

0:34:59.440,0:35:01.859
but he said this is the life that he chose.

0:35:01.860,0:35:05.800
That's when he told me that he wanted to live his own life.

0:35:05.800,0:35:11.920
And then after quite a time, that's when he
 came now with tattoos all over his body.

0:35:11.920,0:35:16.640
For quite a time I knew that he needed help.

0:35:16.640,0:35:20.680
But I'm not a person who's used to charms and all that,

0:35:20.680,0:35:23.540
some people would advised me: "Go to so-and-so,

0:35:23.540,0:35:26.960
your son needs deliverance, your
 son needs to be helped."

0:35:26.960,0:35:30.980
But I didn't know where to go, actually.

0:35:30.980,0:35:34.820
So five years back I got introduced to Emmanuel TV.

0:35:34.820,0:35:38.260
And I started watching it and something told me that

0:35:38.260,0:35:42.700
this is where I'm going to find a solution for myself

0:35:42.700,0:35:46.500
and actually for my son, I needed deliverance for him.

0:35:46.500,0:35:52.160
So it took me time to find a person who 
I could connect so that we might come here.

0:35:52.160,0:35:56.980
After doing all the arrangements last year I told him that

0:35:56.980,0:35:58.440
I wanted him to come:

0:35:58.440,0:36:01.300
"There's a place that I want you to come with to.

0:36:01.300,0:36:04.100
It is a church and that's where
 you're going to be delivered,

0:36:04.100,0:36:09.480
because I want you back, I want
 the son that I gave birth to.

0:36:09.480,0:36:13.980
Not you, you are not the son that I gave birth to, satan is using you."

0:36:13.980,0:36:20.160
He agreed, and then he said: "Okay, mum,
 I'll come on Saturday, all right?"

0:36:20.160,0:36:23.760
Saturday I waited for him - actually,
 he said he'd come on Friday,

0:36:23.760,0:36:28.920
on Friday he didn't come, on Friday night
 he said: "I will be there tomorrow morning."

0:36:28.920,0:36:32.400
And the next thing - tomorrow 
morning I received a message to say:

0:36:32.400,0:36:36.080
"Mum, I think I'm the one who 
caused these things to myself,

0:36:36.080,0:36:40.600
these are my problems, I'll see 
to it that I sort myself out."

0:36:40.600,0:36:46.700
So I was so disappointed, I didn't respond to that.

0:36:46.700,0:36:50.720
During early this year his children came to visit and he

0:36:50.720,0:36:55.380
also came to visit, so I begged him to stay and sleep at home

0:36:55.380,0:36:58.260
because he was not used to sleeping at my place,

0:36:58.260,0:36:59.480
he would come and go.

0:36:59.480,0:37:02.940
Because his children were there, 
we started sitting together,

0:37:02.940,0:37:06.420
and normally, my TV is always on Emmanuel.

0:37:06.420,0:37:12.740
And we would see it and we would talk and fortunately

0:37:12.740,0:37:15.391
most of the things that were coming up there,

0:37:15.400,0:37:19.780
were worse than what he thought he was doing.

0:37:19.780,0:37:22.240
He even said: "Things are worse than me,

0:37:22.240,0:37:24.980
I'm better than these people who appear here.

0:37:24.990,0:37:27.820
I thought that I am the worst but I think I'm better."

0:37:27.820,0:37:36.660
So he gradually got to like it and 
then he disappeared again.

0:37:36.660,0:37:40.760
When you called him, he didn't pick up the phone - not at all.

0:37:40.760,0:37:45.020
So I didn't know what to do, but one 
day I decided to say - I'm going to ask God.

0:37:45.020,0:37:51.800
I am definitely going to spend days asking 
God for him to agree to come to SCOAN.

0:37:51.800,0:37:57.740
So I took days praying for that,
 over that and then finally one morning

0:37:57.750,0:38:01.590
I woke up and then I decided that
 I was going to call him that day.

0:38:01.590,0:38:04.529
I started taking my books, reading my books

0:38:04.529,0:38:08.680
and then I prayed. After praying I took my phone

0:38:08.680,0:38:13.840
and I sprayed the Morning water 
on it and I said: "My God,

0:38:13.840,0:38:18.660
God of TB Joshua, this boy is going 
to answer my phone today.

0:38:18.660,0:38:20.840
And he's going to come when I call him."

0:38:20.840,0:38:25.600
I wiped my phone so that it may not get damaged,

0:38:25.600,0:38:29.040
after that I called him - he picked up the phone.

0:38:29.040,0:38:31.578
I said: "I want to see you. When can you come?"

0:38:31.578,0:38:33.574
He said: "Okay, I will come tomorrow."

0:38:33.580,0:38:36.720
And tomorrow morning, he was there.

0:38:36.720,0:38:42.140
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:38:42.140,0:38:48.800
Then when he came, I started telling him:
 "I am going to SCOAN in June."

0:38:48.800,0:38:55.000
Actually I was saying it was in June, I want to
 be there on the birthday of the prophet,

0:38:55.000,0:38:59.260
because mine is on the 16th, his is on the 19th of June.

0:38:59.260,0:39:02.160
I said I want us to be there.

0:39:02.160,0:39:06.900
And then I told him and then we 
stayed and we watched Emmanuel TV.

0:39:06.900,0:39:08.840
We spoke about a lot of things.

0:39:08.840,0:39:13.740
That's when I gave him money to go 
and do the passport, after a few days

0:39:13.740,0:39:15.829
I called him because I knew how he was.

0:39:15.829,0:39:17.729
So I called him: "Did you make the passport?"

0:39:17.730,0:39:21.320
He said: "Yes, mum, am just waiting for 
the call to say I must go and fetch it."

0:39:21.320,0:39:25.880
After two-three weeks I called him:
"No, I haven't yet collected it."

0:39:25.880,0:39:29.580
Until finally he said: "You know, mom, I spent that money."

0:39:29.580,0:39:32.680
And I gave him money other than for that.

0:39:32.680,0:39:35.860
And then I said: "Okay, this time I think you must come

0:39:35.860,0:39:39.080
with that site so that we do that that site."

0:39:39.080,0:39:42.380
And he definitely did come, we did the passport,

0:39:42.380,0:39:46.948
he also didn't have his ID, we had to do another ID now.

0:39:46.948,0:39:51.160
But from there I didn't trust him still, he went away,

0:39:51.160,0:39:56.620
he came back again and then when he came back,

0:39:56.620,0:39:59.640
we sat and then we watched Emmanuel TV,

0:39:59.640,0:40:02.680
and then I told him that - one day I told him that

0:40:02.680,0:40:03.860
our date has come out:

0:40:03.863,0:40:07.160
"When can you be able to come 
because we are leaving in three days."

0:40:07.160,0:40:09.400
He said: "Okay, I'll be there tomorrow."

0:40:09.400,0:40:13.460
The next morning at about 8 o'clock he appeared.

0:40:13.460,0:40:15.560
It was very early in the morning.

0:40:15.560,0:40:19.580
I looked at him but he was looking strange.

0:40:19.580,0:40:24.320
I just greeted him, and then I went
into another room. When I came back,

0:40:24.330,0:40:28.560
he was now okay and I said: 
"You definitely are ready."

0:40:28.560,0:40:30.060
Because he had everything.

0:40:30.060,0:40:34.000
That's when I started to realize that we were coming here.

0:40:34.000,0:40:38.220
And remember, I was also sick for three months

0:40:38.220,0:40:40.080
I was very sick - all my joints.

0:40:40.080,0:40:48.480
I was always sleeping because I was very sick, 
I needed deliverance and I needed healing too.

0:40:48.480,0:40:52.980
Fortunately, when I came here, I got healed -

0:40:52.980,0:40:56.580
the prophet touched me and then I got healed.

0:40:56.580,0:40:59.840
I was happy, I was healed and then of
 all of a sudden

0:40:59.840,0:41:04.600
I didn't see the Prophet touching 
him because I was all over the place by then.

0:41:04.600,0:41:10.600
But then I heard the Prophet calling him, 
saying there's a man with tattoos and he is a thief.

0:41:10.600,0:41:14.340
I just jumped, because I would see sit at that side,

0:41:14.340,0:41:18.420
I just jumped and said: "Thank you, Lord. This is my day."

0:41:18.420,0:41:22.760
"This is the day the Lord has made for me to get delivered and my son to be delivered."

0:41:22.760,0:41:26.500
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:41:26.500,0:41:31.680
We can really see, it was indeed God's
 time to restore this family completely.

0:41:31.680,0:41:36.120
And madam, ever since that prophecy 
and deliverance your son received,

0:41:36.120,0:41:40.720
can you just tell us the changes 
you've witnessed in his life?

0:41:40.720,0:41:43.760
Actually we were privileged

0:41:43.760,0:41:48.000
to stay for another week here at Synagogue.

0:41:48.000,0:41:51.080
Free accommodation, free food.

0:41:51.080,0:41:54.235
That's when I realized that God is with us.

0:41:54.235,0:41:57.729
God is really with us and when we talked about it,

0:41:57.740,0:42:02.109
he was excited to say: "When I come out of here,

0:42:02.109,0:42:05.319
I'll be perfect that other week is not just for fun.

0:42:05.320,0:42:08.216
It is really where God is working within us."

0:42:08.220,0:42:10.820
And then while we were staying here

0:42:10.820,0:42:15.060
he was always on his books, reading the Bible,

0:42:15.060,0:42:19.800
coming for classes and even in 
the class I would just look at him:

0:42:19.800,0:42:21.900
what is he doing there? He was taking notes.

0:42:21.900,0:42:24.720
He was responding, he was asking questions.

0:42:24.720,0:42:28.800
And I said: "Now this is my boy, he is okay."

0:42:28.800,0:42:32.840
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:42:32.840,0:42:35.140
We give all the glory to God for what He has done

0:42:35.145,0:42:36.909
in the life of this family. And madam,

0:42:36.910,0:42:40.140
what is your word of advice to 
viewers around the world

0:42:40.140,0:42:43.580
with what the Lord has done for
 you and your son?

0:42:43.580,0:42:47.280
My word of advice to the parents out there

0:42:47.280,0:42:52.400
is that it's quite important to 
stay with your children.

0:42:52.400,0:42:58.140
Be there for them. Yes, other 
people can look after your children.

0:42:58.140,0:43:00.500
Don't judge the situation that we are living in,

0:43:00.500,0:43:04.340
make it a point that your children
 are always with you so that

0:43:04.340,0:43:07.760
so that you see every movement that they make.

0:43:07.760,0:43:13.000
Because I think if I was around him,
 he wouldn't have gone so far.

0:43:13.000,0:43:15.680
It is because I was not there most of the time,

0:43:15.680,0:43:18.880
and sometimes they wouldn't even tell me that sometimes

0:43:18.880,0:43:23.019
he was not sleeping at home because he was jailed and all that.

0:43:23.020,0:43:26.920
I didn't know why, it's just now that I hear about that.

0:43:26.920,0:43:30.560
So it is highly important that we stay with our children,

0:43:30.560,0:43:33.080
we teach our children about the Word of God,

0:43:33.080,0:43:37.220
we ensure that they are here next to us

0:43:37.220,0:43:39.460
and make sure that they come to church,

0:43:39.460,0:43:45.680
they know God,  they work for God, we 
pray together and do everything together.

0:43:45.680,0:43:48.740
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:43:48.740,0:43:52.200
And we just want to hear a final
 word from our brother as well.

0:43:52.200,0:43:55.460
My advice will be to my colleagues
 and my friends out there.

0:43:55.460,0:43:59.740
I know, some of them are watching me.

0:43:59.740,0:44:05.740
You know, out there - it's easier
 to die than to live.

0:44:05.740,0:44:08.230
So put your trust in God, even if you have problems,

0:44:08.230,0:44:10.289
some of the problems you can't handle them.

0:44:10.289,0:44:15.260
Just put all your problems into Jesus,
 only Jesus can change your life.

0:44:15.260,0:44:15.960
Thank You!

0:44:15.960,0:44:18.700
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:44:18.700,0:44:21.960
Just a final question brother, you 
said before you had the impression

0:44:21.960,0:44:24.360
that perhaps because of your appearance with the tattoos

0:44:24.360,0:44:25.940
that you would be condemned or

0:44:25.940,0:44:28.340
be looked down upon in the church.

0:44:28.350,0:44:30.826
What is your word of advice to
 people who may be watching right now

0:44:30.826,0:44:32.760
with a similar thought - they feel that perhaps,

0:44:32.760,0:44:34.980
because of the way they look, their appearance

0:44:34.980,0:44:37.080
they will not be accepted in the house of God.

0:44:37.080,0:44:39.940
What do you really want to advise such people as well?

0:44:39.940,0:44:45.760
Well, I'll say don't look at the outside, 
just look at the inside.

0:44:45.760,0:44:49.480
Because that's where God lives,

0:44:49.480,0:44:53.820
He actually looks at the inside of a human being.

0:44:53.820,0:44:57.080
Amen, let's put our hands together
 for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:44:57.080,0:44:59.080
