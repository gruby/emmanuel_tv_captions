0:00:03.420,0:00:09.700
Man of God, help me!

0:00:09.700,0:00:11.420
What happened?

0:00:11.420,0:00:15.820
They want to jail me with my children because of a debt.

0:00:15.820,0:00:16.800
They want to do what?

0:00:16.800,0:00:21.940
To jail me and my children because of the debt that I am owing.

0:00:21.940,0:00:23.120
Why?

0:00:23.120,0:00:29.680
Money lenders. I borrowed money to start my business, the business collapsed and I could not pay.

0:00:29.680,0:00:30.820
They want to jail you?

0:00:30.820,0:00:32.940
Yes, man of God, set me free.

0:00:32.940,0:00:34.660
What did you use the money for?

0:00:34.660,0:00:36.880
I used it to open my business.

0:00:36.880,0:00:38.200
How much is the money?

0:00:38.200,0:00:40.000
It is 350,000 (naira).

0:00:40.000,0:00:41.780
How much do you have?

0:00:41.780,0:00:44.580
I don’t have any. Everything scattered.

0:00:44.580,0:00:46.460
What do you have in the shop?

0:00:46.460,0:00:49.660
Nothing.

0:00:49.660,0:00:54.140
I'm selling as if I am not selling. I am not seeing the money.

0:00:54.140,0:00:58.940
I am not seeing anything.

0:00:58.940,0:01:01.980
I did not use it to buy anything. I could not even use it to feed.

0:01:01.980,0:01:07.240
I can't pay my rent. I can't pay my store rent.

0:01:07.240,0:01:08.640
Are you living alone?

0:01:08.640,0:01:13.600
I am with my children. From Warri (Delta, Nigeria) to this place, I borrowed money to come.

0:01:13.600,0:01:15.200
Where is your husband?

0:01:15.200,0:01:18.340
Another woman took him from me.

0:01:18.340,0:01:23.000
I have been suffering with the children for four years.

0:01:23.000,0:01:28.660
OK, it is alright.

0:01:28.660,0:01:30.640
Your children, are they schooling?

0:01:30.640,0:01:33.960
They are schooling but there is no money to pay their school fees.

0:01:33.960,0:01:37.280
What is your problem now? Is it you debt? Or your…

0:01:37.280,0:01:41.860
It is the debt, first of all. They want to jail me and my children. Every day, they threaten me.

0:01:41.860,0:01:43.900
So, they will jail me with you.

0:01:43.900,0:01:46.520
Amen.

0:01:49.920,0:01:53.700
Don't worry. It's alright. You will receive your deliverance.

0:01:53.700,0:01:55.840
Don't worry, OK?

0:01:55.840,0:01:57.900
Your deliverance is more important.

0:01:57.900,0:01:58.700
Amen.

0:01:58.700,0:01:59.900
OK.

0:01:59.900,0:02:01.420
Jesus will pay your money.

0:02:01.420,0:02:02.460
Amen.

0:02:02.460,0:02:04.440
After paying your money, He will deliver you.

0:02:04.440,0:02:05.120
Amen.

0:02:05.120,0:02:06.500
OK, don't cry.

0:02:06.500,0:02:07.180
OK?

0:02:07.180,0:02:07.700
Yes, sir.

0:02:07.700,0:02:09.280
Jesus will help us to pay it.

0:02:09.280,0:02:09.820
Amen.

0:02:09.820,0:02:12.400
OK, it's alright.

0:02:15.720,0:02:24.700
The Lord will use me to deliver her and to pay the debt, which is 350,000 naira.

0:02:24.700,0:02:28.860
Praise the Lord!

0:02:28.860,0:02:30.880
Hallelujah!

0:02:30.880,0:02:33.160
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:33.160,0:02:37.200
People of God, I want you to support now.

0:02:37.200,0:02:44.820
This woman must have something to train her children and start business back.

0:02:44.820,0:02:50.540
In response to T.B. Joshua's injunction, members begin to come forward to contribute what they have,

0:02:50.540,0:02:52.260
in order to support the woman.

0:02:52.260,0:02:56.620
Different currencies and denominations were given by the congregation comprising of

0:02:56.620,0:03:01.140
both national and international worshippers.

0:03:06.280,0:03:09.480
More and more people trooped out to give a worthy offering,

0:03:09.480,0:03:12.100
knowing that what they have in their hands now

0:03:12.100,0:03:15.060
can be a solution to the problem at hand.

0:03:15.060,0:03:19.220
Mrs. Christopher cannot hide her feelings of joy and surprise

0:03:19.220,0:03:22.740
as the congregation continues flooding to the offering bowls.

0:03:29.360,0:03:32.740
Can you give the woman the 350,000 (naira)?

0:03:32.740,0:03:39.140
Look at the screen of your TV. There is a man of God handing over...

0:03:39.140,0:03:44.940
giving her the sum of 350,000 naira in cash.

0:03:44.940,0:03:50.660
The amount she owes...

0:03:52.700,0:04:00.200
This woman must go home with 2 million naira.

0:04:12.020,0:04:14.820
Oh, this is how you are!

0:04:14.820,0:04:19.280
I used to say that it's a lie, the good things you do.

0:04:21.540,0:04:25.460
More and more.

0:04:25.460,0:04:26.540
Is it for me?

0:04:26.540,0:04:29.120
Sister, is it true? All this is for me?

0:04:29.120,0:04:32.000
Watch your screen.

0:04:32.000,0:04:38.360
If you must receive, you must learn to give - your love, your kindness.

0:04:38.360,0:04:40.960
What we are doing now, we are not doing to display this

0:04:40.960,0:04:54.060
but we are communicating to you that this is what the Gospel is all about: care, cheerful giver.

0:04:54.060,0:05:01.960
T.B. Joshua gives the lady a hug, as a way of thanking her for even receiving the gift.

0:05:01.960,0:05:08.000
The container was then taken to a secure place and counted under the supervision of Mrs. Christopher,

0:05:08.000,0:05:14.640
to ensure honesty and transparency.

0:05:14.640,0:05:20.000
Now, Mrs. Christopher is going home with more than sufficient funds to pay her debts,

0:05:20.000,0:05:25.660
with the assurance that she will receive the remaining donation that the members were still contributing,

0:05:25.660,0:05:32.960
which would finally add up to the total of 2 million naira mentioned by T.B. Joshua.

0:05:37.360,0:05:43.920
TESTIMONY TIME

0:05:44.540,0:05:52.020
My name is Patience Christopher. I am from Ugale South, Delta State, Nigeria.

0:05:52.020,0:05:56.020
I am very happy for what the man of God has done in my life today.

0:05:56.020,0:06:01.200
I came here wretchedly from Warri, owing debt.

0:06:01.200,0:06:05.920
The people I was owing were threatening me and threatening

0:06:05.920,0:06:08.580
my children that they were going to jail me and my children.

0:06:08.580,0:06:10.920
They even arrested me.

0:06:10.920,0:06:14.580
The money that I was owing is 350,000 naira.

0:06:14.580,0:06:22.180
When I came to The SCOAN for the first time today, I cried and shouted to the man of God.

0:06:22.180,0:06:25.940
The man of God does not know me and I do not know him but as he was passing by,

0:06:25.940,0:06:28.980
they showed me the man of God and I cried and called upon him.

0:06:32.120,0:06:38.660
Man of God, help me!

0:06:38.660,0:06:40.280
What happened?

0:06:40.280,0:06:43.540
They want to jail me with my children because of debt.

0:06:43.540,0:06:44.860
How much is the money?

0:06:44.860,0:06:46.960
It is 350,000 (naira).

0:06:46.960,0:06:52.580
He answered me and said that they should give me 350,000 (naira).

0:06:52.580,0:06:55.880
Can you give the woman 350,000 (naira)?

0:06:55.880,0:06:59.080
Look at the screen of your TV, there is a man of God...

0:06:59.080,0:07:02.420
And that the members should contribute.

0:07:02.420,0:07:06.320
People of God, I want you to support now.

0:07:06.320,0:07:12.580
This woman must have something to train her children and start business back.

0:07:12.580,0:07:20.240
After the contribution, I realised 750,000 naira, and

0:07:20.240,0:07:23.640
the members are still contributing and I am not a member of this church.

0:07:23.640,0:07:26.780
This is my first time of coming to this place. I am very, very surprised for

0:07:26.780,0:07:30.440
what God has used them to do for me today.

0:07:30.440,0:07:39.200
After receiving 350,000 naira from T.B. Joshua, the members contributed a further 750,000 naira,

0:07:39.200,0:07:41.960
and the members are still contributing.

0:07:41.960,0:07:48.220
Now, she not only has enough money to pay off her debt, she can restart her business

0:07:48.220,0:07:50.460
and care for her family.

0:07:50.460,0:07:51.840
Glory be to God.
