0:00:00.000,0:00:06.180
I want to see you sitting around the table with orphans,

0:00:06.180,0:00:11.580
eating with them and the elderly, giving them a kiss.

0:00:11.580,0:00:15.320
The one we can give to God through the needy,

0:00:15.320,0:00:19.040
the one you can give to God through the less privileged,

0:00:19.040,0:00:22.360
the one you can give to God through    
 widows,

0:00:22.360,0:00:24.560
the one you can give to God through widowers,

0:00:24.640,0:00:27.840
the one you can give to God through physically challenged

0:00:27.840,0:00:31.820
is the one you will give with all your heart,

0:00:31.820,0:00:39.020
with a smile, without murmuring or complaining.

0:00:39.020,0:00:42.300
When you give it, you are giving it to God

0:00:42.300,0:00:45.940
and God will bless you in abundance.

0:00:45.940,0:00:47.700
Have you been doing that?

0:00:47.700,0:00:49.040
No.

0:00:49.040,0:00:51.460
You give with complaining.

0:00:51.460,0:00:53.580
You give with murmuring.

0:00:53.580,0:00:55.920
You are always complaining when you want to give;

0:00:55.920,0:01:01.080
even when you want to give tithe and now give it out.

0:01:01.080,0:01:03.380
You don't even need to talk.

0:01:03.380,0:01:08.060
Once it is change you received from the conductor,

0:01:08.060,0:01:11.920
once it is change you received from the petrol station,

0:01:11.920,0:01:16.040
once it is change, it is a way of saying, "Change"

0:01:16.040,0:01:19.060
and you receive change in return.

0:01:19.060,0:01:23.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:23.320,0:01:26.240
You can't see God but you give the less privileged.

0:01:26.240,0:01:28.180
Through the less privileged to God.

0:01:28.180,0:01:31.920
It's God we are giving but through them.

0:01:31.920,0:01:36.020
He has no hands but our hands to do His work.

0:01:36.020,0:01:40.240
He has no legs but our legs to go where He wants to go.

0:01:40.240,0:01:44.320
He has no mouth to explain Himself How He was crucified

0:01:44.320,0:01:47.820
but our mouth to do that.

0:01:47.820,0:01:56.540
If you give in the name of Jesus, you will never regret.

0:01:56.540,0:02:01.260
But in the name of selfish, classic and material reasons,

0:02:01.260,0:02:04.640
for reasons known to you, you give this,

0:02:04.640,0:02:12.620
you will regret it because man can never be trusted.

0:02:12.620,0:02:17.860
The giving you have done in the past, you think it's lost;

0:02:17.860,0:02:19.700
it is not lost.

0:02:19.700,0:02:24.240
If it is in the name of God,

0:02:24.240,0:02:30.080
you will receive the reward at a time you need it most.

0:02:30.080,0:02:32.060
That is what has happened to many of you.

0:02:32.060,0:02:38.600
Sometimes you see help just come at the very time you need it.

0:02:38.600,0:02:45.680
But you have forgotten you have done it to someone in the past.

0:02:45.680,0:02:52.900
One can never get to any place or any position without genuine giving.

0:02:52.900,0:02:55.660
If you don't give your love genuinely,

0:02:55.660,0:03:01.260
you can never and you will never receive genuine love from people.

0:03:01.260,0:03:04.560
As you lay your bed, you sleep on it.

0:03:04.560,0:03:15.380
The more you give, the greater your money, if you give genuinely,

0:03:15.380,0:03:19.420
not giving whilst murmuring or complaining.

0:03:19.420,0:03:21.260
When you are giving it, you begin to complain,

0:03:21.260,0:03:26.000
"What will I eat? How will I go about it? What will happen to me next?"

0:03:26.000,0:03:30.080
That is, you have nullified the processing.

0:03:30.080,0:03:35.520
Begin to give. That is my life for you.

0:03:35.520,0:03:43.660
When you are giving, you have to believe God and trust Him

0:03:43.660,0:03:49.200
that He's the one you are giving to.

0:03:49.200,0:03:55.280
See your contribution as an assignment from God.

0:03:55.280,0:03:59.260
Look at what I'm doing now. I'm talking to you.

0:03:59.260,0:04:04.360
It is an assignment from God.

0:04:04.360,0:04:08.720
I'm looking at you. It is an assignment from God.

0:04:08.720,0:04:12.220
Give me your hand. It is an assignment from God.

0:04:12.220,0:04:14.960
I'm not seeing it as helping you

0:04:14.960,0:04:17.640
but as an assignment given to me from God.

0:04:17.640,0:04:22.880
And I'm not expecting a reward from you. God is my Rewarder.

0:04:22.880,0:04:29.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:29.180,0:04:31.560
When you see it as an assignment from God,

0:04:31.560,0:04:37.660
you will not expect a reward from the person you are helping.

0:04:37.660,0:04:44.960
So, please give so that you will be very great.

0:04:44.960,0:04:47.380
Your greatness depends on your giving.

0:04:47.380,0:04:53.300
Tell your neighbour, My greatness depends on my giving.

0:04:53.300,0:04:56.260
When you give fast, you'll be great fast.

0:04:56.260,0:04:58.660
When you give slowly, you'll be great slowly.

0:04:58.660,0:05:03.740
When you give small, you'll be great small, small, small!

0:05:03.740,0:05:06.120
You're an angel of God!

0:05:06.120,0:05:10.360
An angel of God that gives love of God.

0:05:10.360,0:05:15.460
I'm an angel of God that gives love of God,

0:05:15.460,0:05:22.520
kindness of God, goodness of God, humility, faithfulness!

0:05:22.520,0:05:24.660
I'm an angel of God!

0:05:24.660,0:05:27.060
Be bold to say, I'm an angel of God!

0:05:27.060,0:05:29.060
I'm an angel of God!

0:05:29.060,0:05:34.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:34.360,0:05:37.540
Many of us here, in one way or the other,

0:05:37.540,0:05:43.540
you have accused some of our elderly to be witches or wizards.

0:05:43.540,0:05:46.980
Please, it is time to reconcile!

0:05:46.980,0:06:00.680
Attacks are meant for our spiritual benefit.

0:06:00.680,0:06:03.780
So, please, it is time to reconcile.

0:06:03.780,0:06:10.220
You have accused any of our mummy, daddy, elderly to be a witch or wizard

0:06:10.220,0:06:14.160
or some of the gods - the small small gods

0:06:14.160,0:06:17.340
which you created by yourself

0:06:17.340,0:06:21.940
and you now put it in the cupboard and worship it -

0:06:21.940,0:06:25.880
is now the one telling you, "This person is a witch, this one is a wizard".

0:06:25.880,0:06:28.580
Please, go back and say, sorry.

0:06:28.580,0:06:33.020
Give a kiss and put everything behind you.

0:06:33.020,0:06:36.260
Put it behind you.

0:06:36.260,0:06:39.180
Just put everything behind you.

0:06:39.180,0:06:42.980
And it is an opportunity now for those you have not been greeting

0:06:42.980,0:06:44.340
and they have not been greeting you,

0:06:44.340,0:06:47.320
you say, "Over my dead body, I will never greet them!" -

0:06:47.320,0:06:49.840
it is an opportunity for reconciliation!

0:06:49.840,0:06:57.800
Just go there, give them a call, "Oh, how are you? I miss you! Long time!"

0:06:57.800,0:07:00.140
"Who is on the line?"

0:07:00.140,0:07:03.220
"I miss you!" - keep saying, "I miss you!"

0:07:03.220,0:07:11.100
Even if satan hears, "I miss you!", he'll want to listen to you.

0:07:11.100,0:07:19.060
"I miss you!"

0:07:19.060,0:07:22.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:22.520,0:07:28.000
Give a call to those of whom you believe, "No, I will never call them!

0:07:28.000,0:07:30.000
I will never have anything to do with them!"

0:07:30.000,0:07:32.480
Give them a call!

0:07:32.480,0:07:34.240
Please.

0:07:34.240,0:07:42.640
If you can use this occasion to settle with people you see as your enemies,

0:07:42.640,0:07:51.600
the sky will be your limit.

0:07:51.600,0:08:01.260
If enemies can stop people, I would have been stopped.

0:08:01.260,0:08:07.380
They are there to test your faith.

0:08:07.380,0:08:18.620
Testing or attacks or challenges you are talking about is the beauty in our journey.

0:08:18.620,0:08:26.140
Anytime there is trouble that disturbs you, it is an opportunity to be promoted.

0:08:26.140,0:08:31.080
Instead, you think otherwise.

0:08:31.080,0:08:37.500
I know God has prepared you for this journey.

0:08:37.500,0:08:41.560
You can start doing the job on the phone.

0:08:41.560,0:08:45.840
People you have not been speaking to for many years,

0:08:45.840,0:08:50.840
for one reason or the other - please, make a phone call.

0:08:50.840,0:08:56.440
Rededicate yourself, please.

0:08:56.440,0:09:01.660
I declare here I have not done enough.

0:09:01.660,0:09:08.280
It is true that I give to the needy, less privileged, orphans

0:09:08.280,0:09:16.720
but I now realise that I have not done enough.

0:09:16.720,0:09:20.100
Rise up. Let me pray with you.

0:09:20.100,0:09:27.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:27.060,0:09:37.000
Your love for one another is not enough.

0:09:37.000,0:09:41.280
Your care for one another is not enough.

0:09:41.280,0:09:47.140
And what is not done well is not done at all.

0:09:47.140,0:09:54.720
Open your lips and begin to cry to God.

0:09:54.720,0:10:05.780
Give me the grace, Lord, to love one another.

0:10:05.780,0:10:20.600
I want to be a cheerful giver.

0:10:20.600,0:10:27.360
Give me the grace, Lord.

0:10:27.360,0:10:39.640
A heart that loves, a heart that cares.

0:10:39.640,0:10:48.960
I need You more and more

0:10:48.960,0:10:58.440
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:10:58.440,0:11:08.000
I need You more and more

0:11:08.000,0:11:17.740
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:11:17.740,0:11:22.460
Like a flower needs the rain

0:11:22.460,0:11:27.200
Like a bird needs the wind

0:11:27.200,0:11:34.660
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:11:34.660,0:11:44.600
I need You more and more

0:11:44.600,0:11:53.900
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:11:53.900,0:12:05.400
I need You more and more

0:12:05.400,0:12:14.500
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:12:14.500,0:12:19.160
Like a flower needs the rain

0:12:19.160,0:12:23.740
Like a bird needs the wind

0:12:23.740,0:12:32.620
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:12:32.620,0:12:37.020
Like a flower needs the rain

0:12:37.020,0:12:41.500
Like a bird needs the wind

0:12:41.500,0:12:49.480
I need You more and more Jesus every day

0:12:49.480,0:12:54.560
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:12:54.560,0:13:08.180
Lord Jesus, give us a heart that loves, a heart that cares, in Jesus Christ's name.

0:13:08.180,0:13:12.340
You may be seated.

0:13:12.340,0:13:14.600
God bless you, thank you.
