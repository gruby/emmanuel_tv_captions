Come on. Can I talk to you?

Prophecy Time

0:00:06.620,0:00:07.560
How are you?

0:00:07.560,0:00:08.560
I am fine, sir.

0:00:08.560,0:00:10.840
I hope if I talk to you, you will not be annoyed?

0:00:10.840,0:00:11.500
No, sir.

0:00:11.500,0:00:12.860
Are you here for deliverance?

0:00:12.860,0:00:13.560
Yes, sir.

0:00:13.560,0:00:15.180
Because you are a drunkard.

0:00:15.180,0:00:16.920
Yes, sir.

0:00:16.920,0:00:22.200
As beautiful as you are, each time you finish and people see you drunk,

0:00:22.200,0:00:23.940
they always pity you.

0:00:23.940,0:00:24.560
Yes, sir.

0:00:24.560,0:00:26.660
There was a time you were half-naked.

0:00:26.660,0:00:27.300
Yes, sir.

0:00:27.300,0:00:29.080
They had to pull you out of the gutter.

0:00:29.080,0:00:31.520
Yes, sir.

0:00:31.520,0:00:34.580
There was a time they abused you when you took this.

0:00:34.580,0:00:36.140
Yes, sir.

Prophecy Time

0:00:37.300,0:00:40.420
She didn't know that they abused her; it was when she woke up,

0:00:40.420,0:00:44.460
she saw sperms on her body.

0:00:44.460,0:00:46.920
Almost five people abused her.

0:00:46.920,0:00:49.060
Prophecy Time

0:00:49.060,0:00:51.180
It is a curse.

0:00:51.180,0:00:53.320
Man of God, what you said is true.

0:00:53.320,0:00:59.320
My own problem is that when I drink, I aIways beat up my children.

0:00:59.320,0:01:02.120
When you drink, you always beat up your children?

0:01:02.120,0:01:03.540
Yes, sir.

0:01:03.540,0:01:06.620
All the money I was having, I would spend it.

0:01:06.620,0:01:09.480
Sometimes, I would drink for one week without stopping.

0:01:09.480,0:01:11.280
I would not eat anything.

0:01:11.280,0:01:16.540
Every day, I would  smoke four packets of cigarettes.

0:01:16.540,0:01:19.820
When I finished doing it, I would start regretting.

0:01:19.820,0:01:21.940
I don't even know what got me into doing that -

0:01:21.940,0:01:25.460
either I would be too happy or too sad and I would start.

0:01:25.460,0:01:30.260
Lately, I have been wanting to commit suicide for no reason.

0:01:30.260,0:01:32.200

TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:47.100,0:01:48.000
Shall we rise up.

0:01:48.000,0:01:53.480
What shall we say unto the Lord

0:01:53.480,0:02:01.180
All we have to say is thank You Lord

0:02:01.180,0:02:08.720
What shall we say unto the Lord

0:02:08.720,0:02:16.600
All we have to say is thank You Lord

0:02:16.600,0:02:20.360
Thank You, Lord

0:02:20.360,0:02:25.020
Thank You, Lord

0:02:25.020,0:02:33.340
All we have to say is thank You Lord

0:02:33.340,0:02:40.440
Praise the Lord! Children of God, Emmanuel!

0:02:40.440,0:02:43.380
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:43.380,0:02:46.280
My name is Mrs. Sandra Shaw.

0:02:46.280,0:02:52.880
This is my husband and my two children.

0:02:52.880,0:02:56.380
I want to thank God for my life and my family.

0:02:56.380,0:02:59.600
Sunday was the first time I had been to The SCOAN.

0:02:59.600,0:03:02.940
I had never seen the prophet before in my life.

0:03:02.940,0:03:09.640
When he was giving prophecies, he came to my seat and called me out

0:03:09.640,0:03:15.120
and said to me, "You are a drunkard".

0:03:15.120,0:03:20.740
I was shocked and embarrassed but something in me said,

0:03:20.740,0:03:21.980
"You know why you came".

0:03:21.980,0:03:27.480
I had been to places but they had never told me that I was a drunkard before.

0:03:27.480,0:03:31.300
They had always said that I had a spiritual husband

0:03:31.300,0:03:36.000
but nobody had ever told me my problem; I knew my problem.

0:03:36.000,0:03:40.080
So, when the man of God said that, I said, "Thank You, Lord" in my heart,

0:03:40.080,0:03:42.400
that, that was my final bus stop.

0:03:42.400,0:03:43.740
I said, "Yes, sir".

0:03:43.740,0:03:49.960
He said that he hoped I would not be offended if he told me my problem.

0:03:49.960,0:03:52.260
I replied that with all due respect he should please say it

0:03:52.260,0:03:58.980
because everybody knew that the only problem I had was that of drinking.

0:03:58.980,0:04:05.540
I was not ashamed to say that I drank because I had been praying for deliverance.

0:04:05.540,0:04:08.080
Come on. Can I talk to you?

0:04:08.080,0:04:11.740
Prophecy Time

0:04:11.740,0:04:12.580
How are you?

0:04:12.580,0:04:13.640
I am fine, sir.

0:04:13.640,0:04:15.840
I hope if I talk to you, you will not be annoyed?

0:04:15.840,0:04:16.480
No, sir.

0:04:16.480,0:04:17.800
Are you here for deliverance?

0:04:17.800,0:04:18.560
Yes, sir.

0:04:18.560,0:04:20.160
Because you are a drunkard.

0:04:20.160,0:04:22.260
Yes, sir.

0:04:22.260,0:04:27.260
The man of God said that there was a time I was drunk

0:04:27.260,0:04:33.260
and found myself in a gutter and that I had been abused but did not know.

0:04:33.260,0:04:36.120
There was a time they abused you when you took this.

0:04:36.120,0:04:37.500
Yes, sir.

0:04:37.500,0:04:38.980
Prophecy Time

0:04:38.980,0:04:41.900
She didn't know that they abused her; it was when she woke up,

0:04:41.900,0:04:46.060
she saw sperms on her body.

0:04:46.060,0:04:48.440
Almost five people abused her.

0:04:48.440,0:04:50.660
Prophecy Time

0:04:50.660,0:04:52.500
It is a curse.

0:04:52.500,0:04:53.820
In my heart, I said yes.

0:04:53.820,0:04:58.100
In my heart, I knew that once that thing happens...

0:04:58.100,0:05:00.900
I have gotten drunk and after that prepared poison for my kids to drink.

0:05:00.900,0:05:05.580
The only thing that saved my kids was that on that day, a friend took them out

0:05:05.580,0:05:10.940
and refused to release them to me.

0:05:10.940,0:05:16.060
I abused her; I was stoning her gate.

0:05:16.060,0:05:19.520
I said I would cause alarm but she refused to release them.

0:05:19.520,0:05:23.840
If she would have released them, they would have eaten the poison and died.

0:05:23.840,0:05:28.620
Especially my first son, if I got drunk, I would hate him for no reason.

0:05:28.620,0:05:33.760
I would beat him for three days, injure him. I would carry a knife and a bottle.

0:05:33.760,0:05:37.240
Even to see my husband, I would get sad.

0:05:37.240,0:05:43.160
It all started after I had my second son, Daniel, twelve years ago.

0:05:43.160,0:05:49.640
Three weeks after I had given birth to him, my husband bought me a car

0:05:49.640,0:05:53.040
and I had a party.

0:05:53.040,0:05:55.780
The following day, I had a dream.

0:05:55.780,0:06:04.820
In that dream, I was naked and mad, wandering around the streets.

0:06:04.820,0:06:07.820
I woke up and I didn't understand the dream.

0:06:07.820,0:06:11.420
Then, I was not a Christian; I did not go to church.

0:06:11.420,0:06:15.500
I didn't consider the dream; I never even shared it with anybody.

0:06:15.500,0:06:18.280
The next day, I realised that I started bleeding.

0:06:18.280,0:06:21.280
For one year, I had my period, nonstop.

0:06:21.280,0:06:26.040
I went to the clinic and they told me that maybe I had the 'baby blues'.

0:06:26.040,0:06:28.100
Each day, I would be sad.

0:06:28.100,0:06:34.900
I would drink in a way that if you came to my house, you would never know

0:06:34.900,0:06:37.020
that I was drinking because I did it secretly.

0:06:37.020,0:06:40.860
In a day, I could consume 7-8 packets of cigarettes.

0:06:40.860,0:06:45.380
Each time I smoked and drank, something would tell me

0:06:45.380,0:06:48.280
to just enter my car and drive away.

0:06:48.280,0:06:52.820
I would go out without knowing where I was going.

0:06:52.820,0:06:54.880
Afterwards, I would not even remember that I drove somewhere.

0:06:54.880,0:07:00.480
Sometimes, at midnight, 2 AM, 4 AM or 6 AM, I would be driving.

0:07:00.480,0:07:04.740
I would wake up at 10 AM and find myself resting on the steering wheel.

0:07:04.740,0:07:07.220
I would find myself in an unknown location.

0:07:07.220,0:07:12.520
Sometimes, I would drive to the beach, thinking I would drive into the sea.

0:07:12.520,0:07:18.300
I once tried it in Ghana and when I was close to the water, the car engine died.

0:07:18.300,0:07:21.620
It wouldn't start and then, people started gathering.

0:07:21.620,0:07:26.780
Does it mean when you are driving, you park in the midnight and sleep inside the vehicle?

0:07:26.780,0:07:32.000
I wouldn't know I had been driving, how the car stopped or where I was.

0:07:32.000,0:07:34.180
And you would sit inside it there?

0:07:34.180,0:07:34.820
Yes, sir.

0:07:34.820,0:07:37.400
Who would now come to wake you up inside in the vehicle?

0:07:37.400,0:07:40.780
By the time people would wake me, they would have stolen my phones,

0:07:40.780,0:07:46.400
my bag and taken everything in the car.

0:07:46.400,0:07:49.740
In 2009, I had a serious accident.

0:07:49.740,0:07:54.360
Under six years, I have had 8 serious accidents that almost took my life

0:07:54.360,0:07:58.120
but nothing happened to me; the air bag would come out.

0:07:58.120,0:08:02.300
In those eight accidents, my car was destroyed beyond repair.

0:08:02.300,0:08:05.660
The airbag would come out and nothing would happen to me.

0:08:05.660,0:08:08.300
In 2009, I had a very serious accident.

0:08:08.300,0:08:10.400
That accident was the reason I later relocated to Ghana.

0:08:10.400,0:08:12.060
The accident took place in Port Harcourt.

0:08:12.060,0:08:19.460
In that accident, the guy in the vehicle that I had hit, they had to amputate his leg.

0:08:19.460,0:08:25.440
At that time, my husband and I had already started having problems

0:08:25.440,0:08:30.380
because of the drinking; he was no longer happy with the marriage.

0:08:30.380,0:08:35.280
The family of the guy had to fly him out and I had to pay for it.

0:08:35.280,0:08:42.900
I had to sell my property of almost $100,000 to be able to send him

0:08:42.900,0:08:47.460
to USA for medical treatment.

0:08:47.460,0:08:52.640
Anytime I got drunk, I would fight my husband.

0:08:52.640,0:08:57.060
Sometimes, I would pick up the phone and call his employers.

0:08:57.060,0:09:03.260
and started threatening them that if they didn't fire him, I would kill them,

0:09:03.260,0:09:09.260
destroy the company house they had given us and fight all the workers.

0:09:09.260,0:09:13.540
The next day, they would call him and tell him that they were happy with him

0:09:13.540,0:09:15.080
but that they couldn't take this.

0:09:15.080,0:09:18.240
They would say, "Our company is well respected, so we are sorry but

0:09:18.240,0:09:20.080
we can no longer employ you".

0:09:20.080,0:09:24.060
They said that if he wanted to work for them, they would have to transfer him

0:09:24.060,0:09:29.600
to a place far from me and that as long as he stayed with me,

0:09:29.600,0:09:31.560
he couldn't work for them.

0:09:31.560,0:09:37.340
They would sack him. Every month, he would lose his job because of me.

0:09:37.340,0:09:39.480
Still yet, he would stay with me.

0:09:39.480,0:09:42.560
He lost all the friends he had made

0:09:42.560,0:09:46.240
since he came to this country, 35 years ago.

0:09:46.240,0:09:50.400
Nobody talks to him, nobody sits with him because he is still married to me.

0:09:50.400,0:09:55.060
They would say, "We don't know why you're still with this lady that always disgraces you".

0:09:55.060,0:09:57.340
The money he earned every month,

0:09:57.340,0:10:01.100
sometimes up to $30,000, he would give me.

0:10:01.100,0:10:02.720
I can't account for any of it.

0:10:02.720,0:10:07.280
All the money he had worked for, for the past 15 years, I would spend it.

0:10:07.280,0:10:11.340
I wouldn't even know what I used it for because of the alcohol.

0:10:11.340,0:10:15.540
Mrs Sandra Shaw - Prophecy Confirmation

0:10:15.540,0:10:25.680
Last Sunday, the man of God called me out and told me my problem.

0:10:25.680,0:10:29.800
For over 15 years, I had been looking for a solution.

0:10:29.800,0:10:31.680
I got tired of looking for a solution.

0:10:31.680,0:10:39.200
I told God when I came on Sunday that I didn't want to enter 2014

0:10:39.200,0:10:42.160
with this disease or I would kill myself.

0:10:42.160,0:10:45.140
I prayed and fasted before I came.

0:10:45.140,0:10:47.760
I told God that it was my last bus stop.

0:10:47.760,0:10:50.540
I thank God for answering my prayer

0:10:50.540,0:10:53.540
because I never believed I would survive this year.

0:10:53.540,0:10:58.800
I told my God that I didn't want to enter next year with this shame.

0:10:58.800,0:11:02.760
Anywhere I went, people didn't want to have anything to do with me.

0:11:02.760,0:11:05.240
Nobody would want to sit with me.

0:11:05.240,0:11:09.860
Everyone that was supposed to respect me would disrespect me

0:11:09.860,0:11:11.720
because I was an alcoholic.

0:11:11.720,0:11:13.740
I don't find joy in doing it.

0:11:13.740,0:11:15.880
Sometimes, I think, and regret.

0:11:15.880,0:11:22.600
I lost the respect from my children because of my character.

0:11:22.600,0:11:28.360
After my deliverance, for the past week, I have been in the presence of the Lord.

0:11:28.360,0:11:34.080
I have not felt that pain in my heart nor had the urge to drink or smoke.

0:11:34.080,0:11:36.980
I bless God!

0:11:36.980,0:11:42.920

Prophecy Confirmation

0:11:42.920,0:11:45.580
You've listened to that. Let's hear that part again.

0:11:45.580,0:11:51.940
After that deliverance, the urge to smoke, to drink - tell us!

0:11:51.940,0:11:58.180
I noticed these, every week.

0:11:58.180,0:12:07.140
The church I attended in Ghana has a programme on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

0:12:07.140,0:12:16.480
On Mondays, I would drink so that on Tuesdays, I could not go to church.

0:12:16.480,0:12:19.700
Then I would drink on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

0:12:19.700,0:12:22.600
On Thursdays, I would not drink.

0:12:22.600,0:12:27.380
During the early mornings between 2am and 3am on Thursday mornings,

0:12:27.380,0:12:31.340
something would talk to me, "Have a cigarette; have a drink".

0:12:31.340,0:12:34.720
I would have one drink and it would seem as if something had stepped out

0:12:34.720,0:12:36.460
of me and something else had entered.

0:12:36.460,0:12:38.780
I would drink on Fridays and Saturdays.

0:12:38.780,0:12:40.220
On Sundays, I wouldn't be able to go to church.

0:12:40.220,0:12:46.500
It would always happen and in a week, I would have three crises.

0:12:46.500,0:12:51.520
I could wake up happy but then I would start drinking and playing music

0:12:51.520,0:12:57.500
or I would wake up very sad that there would be nothing anybody could do to please me.

0:12:57.500,0:13:01.040
The only people I wanted to hang out with were those who drank.

0:13:01.040,0:13:05.320
If you meant me well, I would not want to be around you.

0:13:05.320,0:13:13.220
After my deliverance on Sunday, that night I dreamt that I saw the man of God.

0:13:13.220,0:13:16.160
The clothes the man of God wore when I saw him on Monday night

0:13:16.160,0:13:19.740
were the same clothes he wore in my dream on Sunday night.

0:13:19.740,0:13:21.780
I was climbing a step.

0:13:21.780,0:13:24.780
As I was climbing the step, the man of God was coming out.

0:13:24.780,0:13:27.400
He said to me, "My daughter, keep climbing; don't look back.

0:13:27.400,0:13:30.280
Just keep going; don't look back. Just go".

0:13:34.880,0:13:41.320
I woke up from that dream and found myself in the camp here. I said, "God, thank You.

0:13:41.320,0:13:45.620
Thank You, Jesus!" because I have always said, when a man of God prophesies to you,

0:13:45.620,0:13:47.360
that there is solution to your problem

0:13:47.360,0:13:50.580
and when you see him in the  dream, indeed you are healed.

0:13:50.580,0:13:55.520
And I said to myself, I even told the people around me that I know that I am healed.

0:13:55.520,0:14:00.020
I feel free! So, since that Monday, the pain...

0:14:00.020,0:14:08.460
Previously, I was scared to go home or anytime it was almost morning, I would be scared

0:14:08.460,0:14:11.020
because I knew that pain would come with full force.

0:14:11.020,0:14:17.040
But since Monday, I have not had any pain in my heart or the urge to drink.

0:14:17.040,0:14:21.900
Each time I think of drinking or smoking, it disgusts me.

What message do you have for the whole world?

0:14:30.100,0:14:33.520
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:14:33.520,0:14:40.820
Viewers all over the world, I want you to know that there is God.

0:14:40.820,0:14:46.620
In any situation you are passing through, just believe in God.

0:14:46.620,0:14:52.520
Let no human being tell you that he will take you here or there.

0:14:52.520,0:14:55.860
I went to some places and was told that if I drank the root once,

0:14:55.860,0:15:01.740
that once I drank it, if I saw alcohol, I would throw up.

0:15:01.740,0:15:09.840
But to my greatest surprise, when I went to such places, my problem became worse than before.

0:15:09.840,0:15:16.820
I want you to know that God is God, and He is the only One who will save you.

0:15:16.820,0:15:25.000
Whoever is having the problem I once had,

0:15:25.000,0:15:29.520
I want you to pick up the courage to come down here, because God is here.

0:15:29.520,0:15:31.240
I didn't even believe that God was here.

0:15:31.240,0:15:33.080
Previously, when people would advise me to come to T.B. Joshua,

0:15:33.080,0:15:35.840
I would reply that they should not talk about it.

0:15:35.840,0:15:40.440
I did not want to go where they cast one out and put 100.

0:15:40.440,0:15:46.000
For 12 years, I had been looking for a solution. This is the first man of God

0:15:46.000,0:15:51.000
who has told me my problem, and hit where it had been happening.

0:15:51.000,0:15:55.540
I bless God for his life and family. Thank You, Jesus!

0:15:55.540,0:15:59.080
I want you not to give up; have courage.

0:15:59.080,0:16:03.460
When I was coming here, the devil was telling me that if I came, I would die.

0:16:03.460,0:16:07.940
I faced challenges. Even on Sunday when I was sitting down,

0:16:07.940,0:16:10.160
the evil spirit told me to leave.

0:16:10.160,0:16:12.740
I told God this was my final bus stop

0:16:12.740,0:16:14.900
and I wouldn't enter next year with this disease.

0:16:14.900,0:16:16.500
It was a decision I made.

0:16:16.500,0:16:19.280
So, no matter what the devil is telling you, that he will kill you

0:16:19.280,0:16:21.540
or any other thing, don't mind the devil.

0:16:21.540,0:16:25.060
He is only fighting to be able to put you in bondage.

0:16:25.060,0:16:27.160
Pick up courage and come.

0:16:27.160,0:16:29.040
Even though you cannot afford to come,

0:16:29.040,0:16:31.120
there are so many people that can assist you.

0:16:31.120,0:16:32.780
If you want, I can assist you.

0:16:32.780,0:16:37.040
If you look at me, you would know that money is not my problem.

0:16:37.040,0:16:41.600
To have money and be humiliated is the worst thing that can happen to you.

0:16:41.600,0:16:45.680
There was a time I prayed to God, saying, "Let me be poor but have my peace".

0:16:45.680,0:16:50.420
Right now, I have my peace and joy, and I am not ashamed to say it.

0:16:50.420,0:16:51.880
I thank God for my life.

0:16:51.880,0:16:56.660
Oh! I like that language. I want you to repeat once again.

0:16:56.660,0:16:59.320
That is, money is not a problem.

0:16:59.320,0:17:01.300
She said there is everything.

0:17:01.300,0:17:04.300
Tell those who believe so much in money.

0:17:04.300,0:17:08.280
Much money, money - they believe so much in money!

0:17:08.280,0:17:13.800
She said that there was a time she prayed for money to go and have peace instead.

0:17:13.800,0:17:20.380
Please start from the issue of money because when my people here hear 'money', they laugh;

0:17:20.380,0:17:23.540
when they hear other things, they clap.

0:17:23.540,0:17:27.120
You see! Nobody claps when they hear 'money'.

Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:17:32.120,0:17:36.720
Children of God, I want you to know money is not the problem

0:17:36.720,0:17:40.520
because if you look at me, you would know that I have it all

0:17:40.520,0:17:42.700
but I didn't have peace.

0:17:42.700,0:17:47.340
It got to a point I told God to make me poor and let me have peace.

0:17:47.340,0:17:52.600
Now, I can sleep and eat. I have peace and joy.

0:17:52.600,0:17:54.540
I thank God for His mercy.

0:17:54.540,0:17:55.960
Thank You, Jesus!

0:17:55.960,0:17:58.820
By what you are saying now, shows that in the past,

0:17:58.820,0:18:06.020
you really wanted to get out of the mess - the problem - because you did not like that lifestyle.

0:18:06.020,0:18:08.720
You just did not know how to get out of it.

0:18:08.720,0:18:10.160
Tell us about that.

0:18:10.160,0:18:18.900
Man of God, for the past eight years I have been living on my own.

0:18:18.900,0:18:23.320
I had not separated or divorced my husband but I chose to live on my own

0:18:23.320,0:18:27.580
because I didn't want to cause him any pain or make him lose his job.

0:18:27.580,0:18:34.700
Ever since I moved Ghana, he has kept a steady job, except when he was sick.

0:18:34.700,0:18:40.060
I had to bring my children to go to school in Nigeria, whilst I was in Ghana

0:18:40.060,0:18:42.380
so that they could be in boarding school.

0:18:42.380,0:18:46.600
During the weekends, they would come home to be with their dad.

0:18:46.600,0:18:49.700
I saw myself as the problem.

0:18:49.700,0:18:53.900
Everyone would be happy but every time I came, everyone would be scared.

0:18:53.900,0:18:58.800
My son would not even have the appetite to eat once he saw me.

0:18:58.800,0:19:01.380
Not that he doesn't love me but he would be scared

0:19:01.380,0:19:04.380
because he knew that every two days, I would have a crisis.

0:19:04.380,0:19:11.820
Whenever I had crisis, he and his father would be the ones to suffer.

0:19:11.820,0:19:16.120
It had affected me and my marriage so much.

0:19:16.120,0:19:21.060
I couldn't do any business. Any money I put into any business would crumble.

0:19:21.060,0:19:26.940
I could drink and spend between $10,000 - $20,000 in a week.

0:19:26.940,0:19:28.620
My name is Jerry Shaw.

0:19:28.620,0:19:31.440
Sandra is my wife and these are my two children.

0:19:31.440,0:19:35.020
For the past five years, it had been hell.

0:19:35.020,0:19:39.500
It has been absolute hell because of the way Sandra behaved.

0:19:39.500,0:19:43.940
Concerning the drinking for the past five years, the more she would drink,

0:19:43.940,0:19:48.300
the angrier she would get, until she  became extremely violent.

0:19:48.300,0:19:52.040
The more violent she got, the more she would turn against the children.

0:19:52.040,0:19:56.520
It is not even up to 10 weeks ago that she was visiting.

0:19:56.520,0:19:59.280
At that time, I was in Abu Dhabi.

0:19:59.280,0:20:02.380
People had to come to the house to rescue the children.

0:20:02.380,0:20:06.460
They had to take them somewhere else and hide them because of her temper.

0:20:06.460,0:20:12.500
She was ripping the flat screen TVs off the walls in the whole house.

0:20:12.500,0:20:17.500
She would smash the TVs on the floor in hot temper because of the alcohol.

0:20:17.500,0:20:21.900
This had been the same chorus for the past five years.

0:20:21.900,0:20:27.020
Before that, she had problems with alcohol but she was manageable.

0:20:27.020,0:20:33.500
For the past five years, she just turned absolutely crazy with the alcohol.

0:20:33.500,0:20:37.520
The difference I see in her this week is much.

0:20:37.520,0:20:41.260
This morning, when she woke up, she was happy and friendly.

0:20:41.260,0:20:45.480
She wasn't like before, snapping at the kids and shouting at everybody.

0:20:45.480,0:20:48.080
This morning when she got up, she was happy.

0:20:48.080,0:20:53.320
She bathed the kids and made sure everyone was okay.

0:20:53.320,0:20:55.760
The kids were terrified of her.

0:20:55.760,0:20:58.880
If you see the children, they were terrified of her.

0:20:58.880,0:21:02.500
As soon as she drank, they would run away and hide.

0:21:02.500,0:21:06.080
When she was sober, there would be no problem and they would love her to bits.

0:21:06.080,0:21:10.280
But as soon as she would have a drink, it was a major problem.

0:21:10.280,0:21:13.520
So, I have seen a massive difference today.

0:21:13.520,0:21:18.000
She is happy, expressing herself and talking.

0:21:18.000,0:21:21.700
She is happy with the kids. She came downstairs to have breakfast,

0:21:21.700,0:21:24.880
which she would never ever do before.

0:21:24.880,0:21:27.500
Now, she is doing it; so, I thank God.

0:21:30.440,0:21:32.460
Wow! You have listened to that.

0:21:32.460,0:21:40.880
I think if the Lord would anoint a minister of God especially for this issue,

0:21:40.880,0:21:46.600
because there are many people in camps for reformation.

0:21:46.600,0:21:55.240
In many homes, children of the rich, heroes,  and presidents are in the camp;

0:21:55.240,0:21:58.100
because of addictions.

0:21:58.100,0:22:01.540
If I am right, let me see your hands.

0:22:01.540,0:22:06.780
This problem is all over the world; all over the world.

0:22:06.780,0:22:09.720
There is no solution.

0:22:09.720,0:22:18.980
We pray that God should anoint ministers of God that can rescue these people all over the world.

0:22:18.980,0:22:23.120
Deliver them just like our sister here has been delivered.

0:22:23.120,0:22:26.900
We want to say happy marriage once again.

0:22:26.900,0:22:32.880
I want to salute our father, who just spoke.

0:22:32.880,0:22:40.640
Ninety percent of men cannot bear what he has borne.

Listen!

0:22:51.200,0:22:55.860
I used to say that to people as a minister of God.

0:22:55.860,0:23:00.960
The issue of racism is not colour.

0:23:00.960,0:23:02.080
It is not an issue of colour.

0:23:02.080,0:23:06.040
They say, "This person is racist, this one is racist, this one is black, this one is white".

0:23:06.040,0:23:09.360
No! The issue of racism is not colour; it is a spirit.

0:23:09.360,0:23:13.220
Can you see what is happening between this husband and wife?

0:23:13.220,0:23:18.960
He was not bearing all those things because the woman was black or white

0:23:18.960,0:23:23.480
but he bore it because he has a good heart.

0:23:23.480,0:23:28.320

0:23:28.320,0:23:32.020
In the world, racism is a discussion based on colour.

0:23:32.020,0:23:40.860
It is not an issue of colour; it is evil spirit in a man or woman.

0:23:40.860,0:23:46.080
I am very sure if it were a black man that married our sister here,

0:23:46.080,0:23:48.880
he would not stand the pain.

0:23:48.880,0:23:51.100
If I am right, let me see your hand!

0:23:53.920,0:23:57.340
They will not stand the pain

0:23:57.340,0:24:05.580
but here is a brother from a different racial background that stood the pain.

0:24:05.580,0:24:10.000
He saw her pain as his own pain.

0:24:10.000,0:24:14.560
Imagine, if our father here had left the marriage a long time ago,

0:24:14.560,0:24:16.740
this woman would have died.

0:24:16.740,0:24:20.280
The woman is alive because the man is with her.

0:24:20.280,0:24:21.460
That is the solution.

0:24:21.460,0:24:26.480
We are having this discussion today because this man is still in the marriage.

0:24:26.480,0:24:31.420
If this man had divorced her a long time ago, we would not be talking about this today.

0:24:31.420,0:24:36.300
She needed a companion like this man, to stay alive.

0:24:36.300,0:24:38.060
She's here today.

0:24:38.060,0:24:40.440
So, tell the whole world.

0:24:40.440,0:24:42.080
Please stretch your hand.

0:24:42.080,0:24:46.540
The issue of racism is not colour.

0:24:46.540,0:24:48.660
It is not colour!

0:24:48.660,0:24:51.260
It is the issue of evil spirit!

0:24:51.260,0:24:53.260
It is not colour!!

0:24:53.260,0:24:58.040
It is not white or black or green.
