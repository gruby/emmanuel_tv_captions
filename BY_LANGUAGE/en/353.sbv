0:00:00.000,0:00:04.940
The evil spirit in this man was among the many who could not escape the anointing of God.

0:00:04.940,0:00:09.280
There is a spiritual battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness.

0:00:09.280,0:00:13.980
As Wise Man Daniel battles the spiritual entities causing crises in this man's life,

0:00:13.980,0:00:17.920
the evil spirits are in trouble and heading towards extinction.

0:00:17.920,0:00:23.180
Let us watch to see how the encounter between Wise Man Daniel and the evil spirit ended.

0:00:23.600,0:00:27.180
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! All over your body.

0:00:27.180,0:00:29.480
All over your body, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:29.480,0:00:32.560
Your face, your legs - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:32.560,0:00:36.420
Anywhere you wicked demon are located -

0:00:36.420,0:00:38.720
fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:38.720,0:00:41.940
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:41.940,0:00:44.520
Fire! All over your body, you demon!

0:00:44.520,0:00:46.280
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:00:46.280,0:00:48.420
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Right now, speak out!

0:00:48.420,0:00:49.360
Allow me to go.

0:00:49.360,0:00:50.540
Who are you?

0:00:50.540,0:00:53.300
Do you want to know me?

0:00:53.300,0:00:55.960
Jesus wants to know you. Speak out!

0:00:55.960,0:00:57.100
Who are you?

0:00:57.100,0:00:58.280
Let me speak.

0:00:58.280,0:01:00.280
Speak! You have no choice; you must.

0:01:00.280,0:01:01.800
Who are you?

0:01:01.800,0:01:04.540
The spirit of lust.

0:01:04.540,0:01:06.140
How many of you are in this body?

0:01:06.140,0:01:07.440
Three.

0:01:07.440,0:01:09.100
Who is the second person?

0:01:09.100,0:01:11.480
Spiritual wife.

0:01:11.480,0:01:13.340
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:01:13.340,0:01:15.100
The last person?

0:01:15.100,0:01:17.020
Spirit of anger.

0:01:17.020,0:01:20.120
Ok. As spirit of anger, how do you operate in this body?

0:01:20.120,0:01:22.540
I make him angry.

0:01:22.540,0:01:24.360
When he is angry, what happens in the house?

0:01:24.360,0:01:28.560
He fights and tries to beat the wife.

0:01:28.560,0:01:30.760
Does he slap or kick?

0:01:30.760,0:01:33.960
He slaps and kicks.

0:01:33.960,0:01:36.100
How do you feel each time he is slapping and kicking the wife?

0:01:36.100,0:01:37.580
How do you feel, you demon?

0:01:37.580,0:01:39.520
I feel good.

0:01:39.520,0:01:40.300
You feel good?

0:01:40.300,0:01:42.480
Yes, very good.

0:01:42.480,0:01:45.360
How has this spirit of anger affected the marriage?

0:01:45.360,0:01:47.400
Which marriage?

0:01:47.400,0:01:49.800
His marriage.

0:01:49.800,0:01:51.800
He doesn't have any marriage.

0:01:51.800,0:01:53.160
No marriage.

0:01:53.160,0:01:54.220
No marriage?

0:01:54.220,0:01:54.740
No.

0:01:54.740,0:01:58.160
We don't have anything to talk about marriage.

0:01:58.160,0:02:01.620
Ok. As spiritual wife, what have you done to his career as a man?

0:02:01.620,0:02:04.660
I destroyed everything.

0:02:04.660,0:02:07.820
This guy - do you know this guy?

0:02:07.820,0:02:09.820
You don't know him.

0:02:09.820,0:02:11.820
He is a very great guy.

0:02:11.820,0:02:14.680
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:02:14.680,0:02:20.180
I destroyed everything - nothing to write about.

0:02:20.180,0:02:22.920
What are the things he had that you have destroyed?

0:02:22.920,0:02:26.440
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:02:26.440,0:02:28.800
Uncountable.

0:02:28.800,0:02:37.580
This man you see here was worth millions but I made him suffer

0:02:37.580,0:02:41.960
and lose every business he put his money into.

0:02:41.960,0:02:43.340
I destroyed those businesses.

0:02:43.340,0:02:45.340
What kind of business was he doing that you destroyed?

0:02:45.340,0:02:47.540
Importation, of course.

0:02:47.540,0:02:49.380
Ehe.

0:02:49.380,0:02:50.600
How did you destroy those things?

0:02:50.600,0:02:57.140
Whenever he imports it, one story or the other.

0:02:57.140,0:02:59.040
I am the one that did it.

0:02:59.040,0:03:00.920
Is it that you seize his containers or how do you go about it?

0:03:00.920,0:03:04.100
Yes, I seized it - a lot of them.

0:03:04.100,0:03:07.520
Like how many did you succeed in getting seized?

0:03:07.520,0:03:11.540
Millions worth of naira.

0:03:11.540,0:03:13.940
He is a great man. He is a rich man.

0:03:13.940,0:03:18.760
You don't know him. He had been abroad for many years.

0:03:18.760,0:03:23.900
For more than 13 years, he made money.

0:03:23.900,0:03:30.600
But I made sure I wiped all the money.

0:03:30.600,0:03:32.940
How do you operate in him as spirit of lust?

0:03:32.940,0:03:36.140
I seduce women.

0:03:36.140,0:03:39.920
How do you use him to go about that?

0:03:39.920,0:03:41.300
When they look at his eyes?

0:03:41.300,0:03:42.680
With my eyes, of course.

0:03:42.680,0:03:46.500
What happens? Explain.

0:03:46.500,0:03:49.220
They will lose control, of course.

0:03:49.220,0:03:53.400
When they lose control, what happens to them?

0:03:53.400,0:03:55.300
They will be following me everywhere.

0:03:55.300,0:03:58.280
How do you use your eyes to move them?

0:03:58.280,0:04:00.280
Can't you see it?

0:04:00.280,0:04:02.180
In my eyes.

0:04:02.180,0:04:03.140
Do you smile or you just stand there?

0:04:03.140,0:04:05.980
Charming - charming eyes.

0:04:05.980,0:04:06.920
That is how you do it?

0:04:06.920,0:04:07.420
Yes.

0:04:07.420,0:04:09.880
Those who are married among them, what happens to their marriage?

0:04:09.880,0:04:11.880
I don't have anything to do with married women.

0:04:11.880,0:04:15.020
Ok. Those who are not married, what happens to them?

0:04:15.020,0:04:16.800
They follow me everywhere.

0:04:16.800,0:04:19.400
When they follow you, what happens to them? Will they have a settled home?

0:04:19.400,0:04:19.920
No.

0:04:19.920,0:04:24.040
Ok. What happens to them that makes them not to have a settled home?

0:04:24.040,0:04:27.400
They will be roaming about.

0:04:27.400,0:04:32.320
They will not even see any man who will marry them.

0:04:32.320,0:04:36.800
How many have you succeeded in destroying like this?

0:04:36.800,0:04:40.600
Many; I can't count them.

0:04:40.600,0:04:41.460
You can't count them?

0:04:41.460,0:04:42.100
Yes.

0:04:42.100,0:04:44.460
Ok. Who is this woman to you?

0:04:44.460,0:04:48.440
Which woman?

0:04:48.440,0:04:49.680
I don't know.

0:04:49.680,0:04:53.480
What about this gentleman here?

0:04:53.480,0:04:54.900
I am alone.

0:04:54.900,0:04:55.820
How are you, ma?

0:04:55.820,0:04:56.920
I am fine, sir.

0:04:56.920,0:04:57.840
Who is he to you?

0:04:57.840,0:04:59.960
He is my husband.

0:04:59.960,0:05:02.360
Ok. What about you?

0:05:02.360,0:05:06.680
We are from the same place and we have been together in Switzerland for many years.

0:05:06.680,0:05:09.000
As a wife, what can you say about your husband?

0:05:09.000,0:05:12.660
He has the spirit of lust, as he said.

0:05:12.660,0:05:16.900
Even now, he has a girl who used to call and insult me.

0:05:16.900,0:05:20.120
She would tell me all sort of things, that my husband will marry her

0:05:20.120,0:05:22.120
and drive me out of the house.

0:05:22.120,0:05:26.460
His family accused me that I am the one who is scattering his business.

0:05:26.460,0:05:30.020
In the marriage, there is no peace.

0:05:30.020,0:05:33.840
They told him to throw me out of the house, that I am a witch

0:05:33.840,0:05:36.460
and the one scattering his family.

0:05:36.460,0:05:42.140
So, I decided to come here so that God would expose whoever was doing this.

0:05:42.140,0:05:45.900
Ok. Your in-laws always accuse you that you are the one causing trouble?

0:05:45.900,0:05:49.220
Yes, his family accused me that I was the one who was scattering his business,

0:05:49.220,0:05:50.660
that he should throw me out.

0:05:50.660,0:05:53.920
Even the business he opened for me, he seized it.

0:05:53.920,0:05:58.140
He beats me every day in the house. He has the spirit of anger

0:05:58.140,0:06:02.740
and he has the spirit of unforgiveness. He doesn't forgive easily.

0:06:02.740,0:06:05.140
So, you demon, it is time you vacate this body!

0:06:05.140,0:06:06.640
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:06.640,0:06:10.160
All over your body, you demon, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:10.160,0:06:13.640
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:13.640,0:06:14.880
You have no choice.

0:06:14.880,0:06:17.160
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:06:17.160,0:06:18.760
In Jesus' name!

0:06:18.760,0:06:19.700
Thank You, Lord!

0:06:19.700,0:06:21.220
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:06:21.220,0:06:22.980
You are free.

0:06:22.980,0:06:24.540
Rise up, you are free.

0:06:24.540,0:06:28.680
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:06:28.680,0:06:30.180
Rise up, you are free.

0:06:30.180,0:06:37.240
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:06:37.240,0:06:38.720
Come, sir.

0:06:38.720,0:06:40.720
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:06:40.720,0:06:42.100
How are you, sir?

0:06:42.100,0:06:42.880
I'm fine.

0:06:42.880,0:06:44.840
Stand up, sir.

0:06:44.840,0:06:46.320
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:06:46.320,0:06:47.660
Don't worry.

0:06:47.660,0:06:50.780
Who is this woman?

0:06:50.780,0:06:52.840
She is my wife.

0:06:52.840,0:06:54.220
Ok. What about the gentleman here?

0:06:54.220,0:06:58.000
He is my brother.

0:06:58.000,0:07:00.340
He is my lovely brother.

0:07:00.340,0:07:07.980
So, ma, listen. The reason why I asked him this question is for you to know that the past is over.

0:07:07.980,0:07:10.040
The confession you heard was not from your husband.

0:07:10.040,0:07:11.560
This is a different person.

0:07:11.560,0:07:14.500
The person who spoke was not your husband but a demon

0:07:14.500,0:07:15.980
and that demon is out.

0:07:15.980,0:07:18.620
So, for no reason should you remind him of what happened today

0:07:18.620,0:07:19.780
so that you will not be tempted, okay?

0:07:19.780,0:07:21.660
Okay. Thank You, Jesus for saving my family and marriage!

0:07:21.660,0:07:23.120
Give thanks to God. You are free.

0:07:23.120,0:07:25.000
Stand up, sir!

0:07:25.000,0:07:30.720
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:07:30.720,0:07:31.940
Thank You, Jesus!

0:07:31.940,0:07:35.080
Thank You, God of T.B. Joshua, for saving my marriage and my home!

0:07:35.080,0:07:36.440
Thank You, Jesus!

0:07:38.560,0:07:46.200
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:07:46.800,0:07:53.140
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:53.140,0:07:57.080
My name is Mr Okpalaeze Chidi.

0:07:57.080,0:08:01.020
I am originally from Enugu State

0:08:01.020,0:08:03.820
but I stayed in Switzerland for many years.

0:08:03.820,0:08:11.380
The woman beside me is my lovely wife, Stella Okpalaeze.

0:08:11.380,0:08:18.460
I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life.

0:08:18.460,0:08:22.660
What God has done in my life - I don't know how to state it.

0:08:22.660,0:08:28.060
My testimony goes like this.

0:08:28.060,0:08:34.460
I have been abroad for 14 to 15 years now.

0:08:34.460,0:08:40.720
I kept on having this problem of setback in business -

0:08:40.720,0:08:46.440
any business I was involved in kept on crumbling.

0:08:46.440,0:08:49.520
I was not moving forward the way I was supposed to

0:08:49.520,0:08:52.940
because I trust myself in anything I am doing.

0:08:52.940,0:08:55.280
I know I am capable to handle it.

0:08:55.280,0:08:58.220
It kept on happening.

0:08:58.220,0:09:01.400
Not until I came back to Nigeria.

0:09:01.400,0:09:03.180
I have been to many churches.

0:09:03.180,0:09:03.900
Ok, brother.

0:09:03.900,0:09:10.200
Before going ahead, you mentioned that, first of all, this problem manifested in the form of business collapsing.

0:09:10.200,0:09:15.280
But, apart from that, what experiences did you begin to have in your dreams

0:09:15.280,0:09:18.620
that made you realise that something was happening?

0:09:18.620,0:09:24.280
A woman used to visit me in my dreams.

0:09:24.280,0:09:29.140
Sometimes, when I woke up, I would see my clothes to be wet.

0:09:29.140,0:09:32.280
Many times when I would be sleeping with my wife,

0:09:32.280,0:09:35.300
she would wake me up and ask me, "What are you doing?

0:09:35.300,0:09:38.080
You are doing as if you are making love to somebody".

0:09:38.080,0:09:42.620
If she woke me up, I would continue to sleep again.

0:09:42.620,0:09:46.020
But it kept on happening to me every time.

0:09:46.020,0:09:50.100
I tried my best to hide it from everybody.

0:09:50.100,0:09:57.380
But every time I was sleeping, the woman would come in my dreams to make love to me.

0:09:57.380,0:10:04.860
Anytime this thing happened, any business I put my hand on - nothing would work out.

0:10:04.860,0:10:07.240
The business started to turn back.

0:10:07.240,0:10:09.240
I am into importation.

0:10:09.240,0:10:12.300
I have travelled to many countries.

0:10:12.300,0:10:16.660
I import containers but one problem or the other -

0:10:16.660,0:10:27.040
either they would seize it or the people I did the business with would dupe me.

0:10:27.040,0:10:36.780
I sponsored many things but at the end, none of them worked out.

0:10:36.780,0:10:41.300
I even tried to use my wife to go on with the business.

0:10:41.300,0:10:46.600
I invested millions of naira in the business I opened for her.

0:10:46.600,0:10:52.480
But at the end of it, nothing came out of it. The same thing happened.

0:10:52.480,0:10:55.660
I even realised that the thing was just like a virus.

0:10:55.660,0:11:00.360
Anybody I did something with, the same thing would happen.

0:11:00.360,0:11:04.220
I thought it was something I could handle myself.

0:11:04.220,0:11:06.740
I knew that something was wrong somewhere

0:11:06.740,0:11:08.740
but I could not exactly figure it out.

0:11:08.740,0:11:10.620
I thought I knew what to do.

0:11:10.620,0:11:12.960
The best friend I had was alcohol.

0:11:12.960,0:11:15.760
I drank in the morning, afternoon and night.

0:11:15.760,0:11:18.260
I didn't have a brand.

0:11:18.260,0:11:21.060
I involved myself in many things -

0:11:21.060,0:11:26.820
womanising, clubbing - just to try to make myself happy.

0:11:26.820,0:11:29.980
I didn't know that the way I was going was the wrong way.

0:11:29.980,0:11:31.240
I couldn't sleep.

0:11:31.240,0:11:36.640
I took all kinds of tablets to make me sleep but I couldn't sleep.

0:11:36.640,0:11:39.840
I would go to bed with acute headache,

0:11:39.840,0:11:42.240
and I would wake up with acute headache.

0:11:42.240,0:11:49.220
It got to a point where my mother even started asking me whether I was smoking Indian hemp

0:11:49.220,0:11:51.220
because my eyes were always red.

0:11:51.220,0:11:56.060
You know that when somebody would go to bed and would not sleep,

0:11:56.060,0:12:00.080
the same way you went to bed would be the same way you would wake up.

0:12:00.080,0:12:04.620
What would happen that you would find women easily being attracted to you?

0:12:04.620,0:12:10.400
You know that it is a man that is in the position to toast a woman

0:12:10.400,0:12:14.640
but there was something in me, in my eyes.

0:12:14.640,0:12:19.980
Wherever I came in or any woman I came across,

0:12:19.980,0:12:25.720
if I looked at her, she would be following me, going after me.

0:12:25.720,0:12:30.020
They didn't need my money. They just wanted me to sleep with them.

0:12:30.020,0:12:34.440
For example, I was at a junction one day, my car had broken down.

0:12:34.440,0:12:37.820
A girl looked at me and greeted me.

0:12:37.820,0:12:42.800
Immediately I drove out, the girl took a bike and went after me.

0:12:42.800,0:12:47.820
Not until I found myself at a joint where I sat down to drink something,

0:12:47.820,0:12:50.680
the girl came in, sat down and greeted me.

0:12:50.680,0:12:54.680
I now said to myself, "Is this not the same girl I saw at the junction?"

0:12:54.680,0:12:57.260
She began to toast me.

0:12:57.260,0:13:02.500
You can imagine where a woman would be proud to talk to a man,

0:13:02.500,0:13:05.760
that she wanted to be with you.

0:13:05.760,0:13:09.500
I noticed this thing many times.

0:13:09.500,0:13:12.540
It happened on several occasions.

0:13:12.540,0:13:16.000
I didn't know what to do about it.

0:13:16.000,0:13:19.380
Now, with all of this life that you were living,

0:13:19.380,0:13:23.880
tell us - what was the effect of this on your marriage and what was happening in your marital life?

0:13:23.880,0:13:27.080
I didn't see my wife as a woman.

0:13:27.080,0:13:29.580
I didn't have affection for her.

0:13:29.580,0:13:34.520
I always had my happiness when I was outside.

0:13:34.520,0:13:37.040
I enjoyed myself outside.

0:13:37.040,0:13:38.560
I came back late.

0:13:38.560,0:13:40.840
I lived the kind of life I wanted to live.

0:13:40.840,0:13:44.900
I had stopped eating my wife's food for months.

0:13:44.900,0:13:46.900
I would eat outside.

0:13:46.900,0:13:50.880
Whenever I was home, any time she wanted to ask me a question,

0:13:50.880,0:13:53.460
I would slap her. I would beat her.

0:13:53.460,0:13:58.280
I even told her, "Can't you read the handwriting on the wall?

0:13:58.280,0:14:03.140
Is it not better for you to pack your things and move out from this house?"

0:14:03.140,0:14:09.340
I have thrown my wife out of the house not less than three or four times.

0:14:09.340,0:14:14.580
Many pastors and family members came in to settle our problems

0:14:14.580,0:14:18.820
but nobody could settle the problem.

0:14:18.820,0:14:23.320
We have been together for more than 11 years

0:14:23.320,0:14:26.580
and we are looking for the fruit of the womb.

0:14:26.580,0:14:34.460
When she was pregnant, I went to the extent of beating her, misbehaving as I was always doing,

0:14:34.460,0:14:39.080
to the extent that she lost the pregnancy of six months.

0:14:39.080,0:14:44.680
She delivered the baby when it was not okay to deliver the baby - at six months.

0:14:44.680,0:14:47.960
Because you had beaten her up - it was the force that caused her to deliver?

0:14:47.960,0:14:52.880
Yes, when all these things came up, I would break things in my house -

0:14:52.880,0:14:55.400
the centre table, the television.

0:14:55.400,0:14:58.560
I would even use my standing fan to hit her.

0:14:58.560,0:15:00.700
I did a lot of things.

0:15:00.700,0:15:04.000
When I realised myself, I would feel pity for her.

0:15:04.000,0:15:10.340
But once that spirit came up, I wouldn't even see her like my wife.

0:15:10.340,0:15:15.080
I didn't even realise that she is a beautiful woman like this.

0:15:15.080,0:15:19.100
I was seeing these women outside as the best.

0:15:19.100,0:15:22.580
I felt happy when I was not in my home.

0:15:22.580,0:15:24.940
I always felt bad when I was coming home.

0:15:24.940,0:15:27.940
So, if I was coming home, what she just needed to do,

0:15:27.940,0:15:32.620
was to go and sleep in her own room because I had told her,

0:15:32.620,0:15:35.980
"I don't want to be sleeping with you. You have to stay in your own room

0:15:35.980,0:15:37.660
and I have to stay in my own room".

0:15:37.660,0:15:44.520
Once I was in, the best thing that happened to her, was that I went inside my room.

0:15:44.520,0:15:49.220
I would lock it because if I didn't lock it, she would come and start to hit at my door,

0:15:49.220,0:15:52.240
that I should open my room for her so that she would sleep with me.

0:15:52.240,0:15:56.180
I didn't want her to sleep with me because I had already been satisfied outside.

0:15:56.180,0:16:01.960
If I came back and she would be asking me questions, I would start beating her.

0:16:01.960,0:16:04.020
Now, brother, we just want to understand.

0:16:04.020,0:16:07.840
People who looked at you at the outside - did they ever know that

0:16:07.840,0:16:12.920
such thing was happening in your home or you were experiencing such terrible problems?

0:16:12.920,0:16:19.860
Everybody that knew me - I put on good clothes, I drive big cars -

0:16:19.860,0:16:22.920
they didn't know that I was dying inside.

0:16:22.920,0:16:24.500
I didn't have a solution.

0:16:24.500,0:16:27.520
I knew that something was seriously wrong.

0:16:27.520,0:16:32.860
I went to many churches but there was no solution to my problem.

0:16:32.860,0:16:38.140
Did it ever come to a point where you felt like giving up on life?

0:16:38.140,0:16:39.680
Not once.

0:16:39.680,0:16:46.360
I even told my wife many times - she is here, she is my live witness -

0:16:46.360,0:16:49.520
that I would put an end to this.

0:16:49.520,0:16:53.660
I thought of committing suicide many times.

0:16:53.660,0:16:57.520
Even one time when I was driving with her, I got annoyed and told her,

0:16:57.520,0:17:03.420
"You see we are on top of the bridge. Do you know that I can just drive this thing directly to that end?

0:17:03.420,0:17:08.720
Everybody will just die. All these problems will end because I am tired of all these problems".

0:17:08.720,0:17:11.900
She wouldn't even talk. It was even better for her not to utter a word

0:17:11.900,0:17:17.200
because if she would have said something good or bad, it would have worsened the situation.

0:17:17.200,0:17:22.460
I didn't like her to advise me or tell me what to do.

0:17:22.460,0:17:24.460
I didn't regard her words.

0:17:24.460,0:17:29.680
I thought about commmitting suicide many times.

0:17:29.680,0:17:35.800
I kept on wondering what I was going to do.

0:17:35.800,0:17:41.020
My beloved mother introduced me to Emmanuel TV.

0:17:41.020,0:17:43.280
I installed it in my room.

0:17:43.280,0:17:47.740
Any time I was home, I would put on the channel

0:17:47.740,0:17:52.900
but I kept on pretending to my mother because she always called me and asked me,

0:17:52.900,0:17:55.720
"I hope you are watching Emmanuel TV". I replied, "Yes".

0:17:55.720,0:18:01.000
But when I looked at it, everything looked fake to me.

0:18:01.000,0:18:04.320
I would just pretend and tell her, "Yes, I am watching it".

0:18:04.320,0:18:08.860
But I didn't believe - I just saw it as an arrangement.

0:18:08.860,0:18:11.960
I said to myself, "How can this be possible?"

0:18:11.960,0:18:14.560
It kept on going like that.

0:18:14.560,0:18:19.060
So you mean when watching Emmanuel TV, if you saw a deliverance and someone was demon-possessed -

0:18:19.060,0:18:20.660
what would you say, what was your reaction?

0:18:20.660,0:18:24.060
I always said that this was a planned something.

0:18:24.060,0:18:26.860
They might have arranged it with the person.

0:18:26.860,0:18:31.600
I didn't believe all these things because I was a Thomas, I didn't believe in anything.

0:18:31.600,0:18:36.080
I believed in seeing something before believing in it.

0:18:36.080,0:18:40.620
I kept on watching Emmanuel TV when I felt like it.

0:18:40.620,0:18:43.320
I saw what happened to other families.

0:18:43.320,0:18:49.280
Whenever I talked with my mother, she always continued telling me, "Keep on watching Emmanuel TV!

0:18:49.280,0:18:53.780
That what is happening to other people will surely happen to you".

0:18:53.780,0:19:00.040
Everybody knew that I had a big problem but they didn't know the solution to that.

0:19:00.040,0:19:02.860
I was a very angry person.

0:19:02.860,0:19:08.640
When I got angry, I could destroy things. I would break things.

0:19:08.640,0:19:12.060
I would even fight my younger brother with a bottle.

0:19:12.060,0:19:16.900
When I was angry like that, even my wife would run into her own room and lock it

0:19:16.900,0:19:21.920
because in my flat, I would break the doors - not less than ten times.

0:19:21.920,0:19:27.640
Ok, brother. Now we understood how severely these evil spirits affected your life.

0:19:27.640,0:19:31.640
You said your mother introduced you to Emmanuel TV and insisted

0:19:31.640,0:19:34.760
that you kept on watching and came down to The SCOAN.

0:19:34.760,0:19:39.580
What actually finally led you to be here at The SCOAN?

0:19:39.580,0:19:45.220
Because people would see me, "Ah, this man is a big man. He has big cars. He puts on good clothes"

0:19:45.220,0:19:47.840
but they didn't know what I was passing through.

0:19:47.840,0:19:51.020
So I began to give it a second thought.

0:19:51.020,0:19:52.860
I said to myself, "Let me go there".

0:19:52.860,0:19:59.740
When I was coming to The SCOAN, I was just coming here, I didn't believe.

0:19:59.740,0:20:03.360
I said to myself, "Let me come and see what is happening here".

0:20:03.360,0:20:09.420
The very first day I came, when the wise men were laying hands on people,

0:20:09.420,0:20:15.540
when they started coming towards my direction, I saw a different thing.

0:20:15.540,0:20:19.480
The fire was coming towards my direction.

0:20:19.480,0:20:21.340
I could not resist it.

0:20:21.340,0:20:25.460
When the man of God layed his hand on me, I fell down.

0:20:25.460,0:20:30.380
The ushers told me to stand here because he was coming back.

0:20:30.380,0:20:36.780
I managed to collect my Bible, ran and escaped from the church.

0:20:36.780,0:20:40.600
So the first day you came here, you actually ran out of the church?

0:20:40.600,0:20:48.100
Yes, I escaped because what I saw that day was a different thing - I could not withstand it.

0:20:48.100,0:20:52.900
I wanted to leave from here without my wife but she knew me very well.

0:20:52.900,0:20:56.780
Once I got angry, she knew that I would leave her.

0:20:56.780,0:21:01.200
She came after me and I did not even talk to her.

0:21:01.200,0:21:04.520
We drove for more than an hour and got home.

0:21:04.520,0:21:08.460
I then began to realise, "What is happening to me?"

0:21:08.460,0:21:12.880
My wife put the TV on - to the same place where we were coming from.

0:21:12.880,0:21:14.880
We were watching the same channel.

0:21:14.880,0:21:17.760
She would not utter any word because she knew very well

0:21:17.760,0:21:21.720
that if she said anything, I might even break her head.

0:21:21.720,0:21:28.280
I sat down and began to ponder, "What is going on in my life?"

0:21:28.280,0:21:33.320
After that, the next week I prepared and said, "I am going back to The SCOAN".

0:21:33.320,0:21:34.980
I came here again.

0:21:34.980,0:21:39.040
It happened that when the wise men started laying hands,

0:21:39.040,0:21:43.120
Wise Man Daniel came towards my direction, the same thing happened.

0:21:43.120,0:21:47.760
But, Children of God, I have to tell you something.

0:21:47.760,0:21:53.460
You might be coming here but the day must surely be your day.

0:21:53.460,0:22:00.140
That day, everything that is troubling you will come to an end.

0:22:00.140,0:22:02.980
Everybody has his own day.

0:22:02.980,0:22:09.380
That very day, that very blessed day, I tried to escape

0:22:09.380,0:22:15.300
but it was like all the ushers - everybody - prepared and were waiting for me.

0:22:15.300,0:22:19.200
Mr Okpalaeze Chidi - Deliverance Testimony

0:22:19.200,0:22:23.680
So they didn't give me any gap.

0:22:23.680,0:22:32.660
When Wise Man Daniel was praying for people, immediately he came towards my direction,

0:22:32.660,0:22:37.540
the fire - I couldn't even look at his eyes.

0:22:37.540,0:22:44.380
When he came directly to me, the fire was so much, I didn't know where I was again.

0:22:44.380,0:22:47.720
I found myself on the floor and woke up.

0:22:47.720,0:22:52.740
I knew that I was saying something but I couldn't control it.

0:22:52.740,0:22:55.280
I didn't know what was coming out from my mouth.

0:22:55.280,0:23:00.720
After my deliverance, my wife told me everything that happened.

0:23:00.720,0:23:04.980
When I woke up, I saw myself in the middle of the church.

0:23:04.980,0:23:10.280
You know, Children of God, it is here that I found out that God exists

0:23:10.280,0:23:13.640
because what happened to me that very day...

0:23:13.640,0:23:17.120
Mr Okpalaeze Chidi - Deliverance Testimony

0:23:17.120,0:23:19.720
...I had never experienced that before.

0:23:19.720,0:23:23.380
The fire was coming from every angle.

0:23:23.380,0:23:28.600
But when I just woke up on the ground, I realised myself.

0:23:28.600,0:23:37.100
I feel like a heavy block, bag of cement, moved out of my body.

0:23:37.100,0:23:39.360
I feel light.

0:23:39.360,0:23:44.100
I feel ashamed of myself - before I was not ashamed of anything.

0:23:44.100,0:23:46.440
I started to feel ashamed.

0:23:46.440,0:23:48.440
I feel very light.

0:23:48.440,0:23:54.700
I recognise my wife. I see her now as very beautiful.

0:23:54.700,0:23:58.260
Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:23:58.260,0:24:00.660
Mr Okpalaeze Chidi - Deliverance Testimony

0:24:00.660,0:24:06.620
What are the changes you have immediately experienced after this experience?

0:24:06.620,0:24:13.740
Children of God, after my deliverance, I was singing with my wife when we were driving home.

0:24:13.740,0:24:22.800
We now eat together, pray together and sleep in the same room - not even the same room but the same bed.

0:24:22.800,0:24:27.140
Testimony Time

0:24:27.140,0:24:32.580
I keep on asking her to forgive me.

0:24:32.580,0:24:36.660
I looked at her hair and the following day I gave her money and said,

0:24:36.660,0:24:39.780
"This hairstyle is not good. She should go and get a different one".

0:24:39.780,0:24:44.700
Mr Okpalaeze Chidi - Deliverance Testimony

0:24:44.700,0:24:47.960
I sleep like a newborn baby.

0:24:47.960,0:24:50.660
I wake up soundly.

0:24:50.660,0:24:57.980
Before, if I wanted to sleep, I would go to my bar and drink like two glasses of a hot drink

0:24:57.980,0:25:01.020
or anything that was there to make me to sleep.

0:25:01.020,0:25:05.680
But this time around, I don't take any pills or alcohol.

0:25:05.680,0:25:10.080
I sleep like a baby. I wake up 100% fit.

0:25:10.080,0:25:14.580
I feel like jumping around.

0:25:14.580,0:25:20.600
I know that a lot of people out there are the same Thomas like I was.

0:25:20.600,0:25:25.340
I believed that seeing is believing.

0:25:25.340,0:25:27.980
You need to see and believe.

0:25:27.980,0:25:34.240
If the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua can do this for me, He will do it for everybody.

0:25:34.240,0:25:37.260
Even for you Thomas that are out there.

0:25:37.260,0:25:42.660
Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:25:42.660,0:25:48.240
My business, what I ordered now - just one week after my deliverance -

0:25:48.240,0:25:52.260
the goods came in successfully and we did the promo.

0:25:52.260,0:25:56.360
The business is booming; it is going on now.

0:25:56.360,0:25:58.960
So, I have a lot of changes.

0:25:58.960,0:26:01.600
I have a good relationship with people,

0:26:01.600,0:26:04.640
I have a good relationship with my wife -

0:26:04.640,0:26:08.360
we discuss everything together what I want to do.

0:26:08.360,0:26:12.480
And you are no longer going outside to meet other women?

0:26:12.480,0:26:14.520
I don't even have the urge to go outside.

0:26:14.520,0:26:17.600
She would even be the one to tell me,

0:26:17.600,0:26:20.320
"Why can't you go out, drive around and come back?"

0:26:20.320,0:26:21.580
I would reply, "No, I am tired".

0:26:21.580,0:26:24.080
I don't have the urge to go around.

0:26:24.080,0:26:28.560
As from that day, I don't see alcohol as anything.

0:26:28.560,0:26:31.540
Women will see me...

0:26:31.540,0:26:36.720
On Valentine's Day, she told me, "We passed so many girls and nobody looked at you".

0:26:36.720,0:26:42.700
Before, she would have a problem with women, every time we would be out together.

0:26:42.700,0:26:44.120
A lot of changes.

0:26:44.120,0:26:48.480
Those things that I was experiencing then, I now no longer experience them.

0:26:48.480,0:26:51.000
Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:26:51.000,0:26:56.100
This is the deliverance that is happening here every day at The SCOAN

0:26:56.100,0:27:02.000
and I know many of us here today are ready and expecting to receive their own deliverance.

0:27:02.000,0:27:05.640
We know that as you receive your deliverance, you too will stands in the midst of God's people

0:27:05.640,0:27:07.380
to share your testimony.

0:27:07.380,0:27:11.920
So, finally, sir, what is your advice to viewers around the world and those present here?

0:27:11.920,0:27:16.180
Especially those who are sceptical, cynical about what is happening here

0:27:16.180,0:27:20.100
as you once were - what is your message to them?

0:27:20.100,0:27:24.680
First of all, I want to ask God to forgive me

0:27:24.680,0:27:30.020
and I want to ask our Daddy in the Lord, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua for forgiveness,

0:27:30.020,0:27:37.460
because I am one of those people that said one bad thing or the other against this place.

0:27:37.460,0:27:46.520
My advice to the whole world - the viewers and especially the Thomases like I once was:

0:27:46.520,0:27:55.560
You have to believe in God and try and come to The SCOAN for your deliverance.

0:27:55.560,0:28:03.700
You might be there, driving big cars, and the things that I experienced in my life are happening to you.

0:28:03.700,0:28:06.880
You need to come down here and have your deliverance

0:28:06.880,0:28:12.320
because everybody that is having this kind of problem needs deliverance.

0:28:12.320,0:28:16.860
Once you have been delivered, you will see a lot of changes.

0:28:16.860,0:28:19.680
You will see a difference in your life.

0:28:19.680,0:28:29.360
And I believe that that God that did it for me will also do it for everyone of you, in Jesus' name.

0:28:29.360,0:28:35.140
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:28:35.140,0:28:36.500
We thank God for your life, sir.

0:28:36.500,0:28:38.700
We just want to hear a quick word from your wife -

0:28:38.700,0:28:41.820
to hear from her, her own side of the testimony.

0:28:41.820,0:28:43.320
Madam, you are very welcome.

0:28:43.320,0:28:48.640
Just introduce yourself to us and tell us what you can say about your husband's wonderful deliverance.

0:28:48.640,0:28:53.380
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:28:53.380,0:28:56.040
My name is Stella Okpalaeze.

0:28:56.040,0:28:58.800
The man beside me is my lovely husband.

0:28:58.800,0:29:00.880
He has already said everything.

0:29:00.880,0:29:04.160
But I also have things to say.

0:29:04.160,0:29:08.320
When this was going on, he hated me with passion.

0:29:08.320,0:29:12.640
He didn't even wanted to see me. Even though I cooked, he said the food was not good.

0:29:12.640,0:29:15.280
Anything I did in the house was not good.

0:29:15.280,0:29:17.520
He beat me the way he wanted to.

0:29:17.520,0:29:21.480
Sometimes I would be begging him: If I did anything wrong, he should please forgive me.

0:29:21.480,0:29:24.480
He replied, "You have not done anything to me but I don't want you see you".

0:29:24.480,0:29:30.000
He told me many times to leave the house but I refused to leave.

0:29:30.000,0:29:36.060
The family accused me, telling him that I was the cause of all this. He should drive me away.

0:29:36.060,0:29:37.580
We were still there.

0:29:37.580,0:29:46.080
Last January, when the thing was severe, each time I watched Emmanuel TV, I kept on praying.

0:29:46.080,0:29:52.900
I used to see many things happening here. Even broken homes were brought back together.

0:29:52.900,0:29:55.740
I knew it would happen for my husband and I.

0:29:55.740,0:30:00.160
Each time we were coming here, if the wise men touched him, he would run away.

0:30:00.160,0:30:02.940
I would not talk because if I talked, it would become a problem

0:30:02.940,0:30:04.600
so I would just keep quiet.

0:30:04.600,0:30:07.020
If he went out, I would be praying.

0:30:07.020,0:30:10.940
I would put Emmanuel TV on and pray, "God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:30:10.940,0:30:13.860
each time I am here, locate me and my husband".

0:30:13.860,0:30:17.880
If the problem is from me, let's go there.

0:30:17.880,0:30:21.540
If Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua sees us and the problem is from me,

0:30:21.540,0:30:23.340
I know the problem will be solved.

0:30:23.340,0:30:28.180
I didn't even tell him that the problem is from him; I kept on accepting it.

0:30:28.180,0:30:32.260
Even when men of God came to settle us when we were having problems

0:30:32.260,0:30:34.260
I would say that I was the problem.

0:30:34.260,0:30:37.480
I believed that one day things would be okay.

0:30:37.480,0:30:42.660
So, the first time we came here, they touched him and he started to manifest.

0:30:42.660,0:30:44.900
They told him to stay behind. He ran away.

0:30:44.900,0:30:48.000
I followed him immediately because I knew he would leave me here and go.

0:30:48.000,0:30:50.540
When I followed him and entered the car, I did not talk.

0:30:50.540,0:30:54.920
I phoned one of his friends and said, "Please, you are the only one that can help me!

0:30:54.920,0:30:56.920
Next Sunday we will come here again.

0:30:56.920,0:31:00.960
When we come, if they touch him, don't allow him to go.

0:31:00.960,0:31:03.540
Help me to hold him so that they will do the deliverance.

0:31:03.540,0:31:06.520
I know that when they will do his own, they will also do mine".

0:31:06.520,0:31:07.780
The friend accepted.

0:31:07.780,0:31:11.420
We came here together on the 26th of January.

0:31:11.420,0:31:15.840
When we came here, the same thing happened when they touched him.

0:31:15.840,0:31:19.580
He wanted to (leave). I looked at the friend and the friend said, "Don't worry".

0:31:19.580,0:31:23.700
The friend went to one of the ushers and told him, "Don't allow this man to go!"

0:31:23.700,0:31:24.620
He said, "Ok".

0:31:24.620,0:31:26.860
That is how they held him.

0:31:33.400,0:31:35.780
Mr & Mrs Okpalaeze - Deliverance Testimony

0:31:35.780,0:31:37.160
That is how they held him.

0:31:37.160,0:31:41.840
They started the deliverance and I was also praying, "God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:31:41.840,0:31:46.740
Help me! I'm in your house today! Help me! This problem is too much for me!"

0:31:46.740,0:31:51.000
That was how they did the deliverance; things went well.

0:31:51.000,0:31:55.220
I thank God today that everything is okay between my husband and I.

0:31:55.220,0:31:57.780
I believe that even the baby that I lost,

0:31:57.780,0:32:03.160
the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua will still make me to have my own child, in Jesus' name.

0:32:03.160,0:32:06.340
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:32:06.340,0:32:08.860
Testimony Time

0:32:08.860,0:32:12.960
So, Madam, you mean that after your husband's deliverance, he is now a changed man?

0:32:12.960,0:32:16.080
He is now a changed man. He now loves me very much.

0:32:16.080,0:32:18.080
He tells me many things.

0:32:18.080,0:32:20.980
Even when I am cooking, he will say, "Let me come and help you". I will say, "No".

0:32:20.980,0:32:24.840
All the things he broke in the house, he brought them back under two days.

0:32:24.840,0:32:27.520
He gives me money. He takes care of me.

0:32:27.520,0:32:32.540
If I do like this, he will ask, "Are you okay?". I will say, "Yes".

0:32:32.540,0:32:36.980
Wow. Indeed the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

0:32:36.980,0:32:40.080
What a wonderful testimony of reconciliation!

0:32:40.080,0:32:45.120
Madam, throughout this terrible ten-year turbulent period with your husband,

0:32:45.120,0:32:47.140
you never left him, you stayed with him

0:32:47.140,0:32:49.960
and today we give glory to God Almighty for your life.

0:32:49.960,0:32:52.040
What is your advice to other couples?

0:32:52.040,0:32:56.720
Especially to women who are in a similar situation you were in. What is your advice to them?

0:32:56.720,0:33:01.000
My advice to all women that are in this situation that I was in before

0:33:01.000,0:33:04.400
or maybe you have gone through this problem,

0:33:04.400,0:33:09.640
the only thing is God because then, friends - everybody - would tell me, "Leave him.

0:33:09.640,0:33:12.020
File a case and go to the law court".

0:33:12.020,0:33:13.620
They said that I should go here or there.

0:33:13.620,0:33:18.600
I replied, "I will not go anywhere. I don't even have money to give to anybody to do something for me.

0:33:18.600,0:33:22.540
It is only the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua that will solve my problem".

0:33:22.540,0:33:26.260
The advice I am giving to you is to believe in God

0:33:26.260,0:33:29.940
because if you see yourself in that condition, people will be advising you to do this or that.

0:33:29.940,0:33:31.400
Don't run to anywhere.

0:33:31.400,0:33:35.480
Don't even go to any native doctor or any person because of your husband.

0:33:35.480,0:33:38.780
Keep on praying and believe that one day, God will do it.

0:33:38.780,0:33:45.260
The God that did it for me, that I am happy today, that God will do it for you, in Jesus' name!
