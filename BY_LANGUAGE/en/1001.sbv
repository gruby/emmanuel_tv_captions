Forgive us as we forgive those who what?

0:00:03.600,0:00:06.120
Thank you. I hope you are ready.

0:00:06.120,0:00:11.360
You are ready? That is your role - put everything behind and look forward.

0:00:11.360,0:00:16.860
I stopped looking back. You keep looking back. Those who offended you yesterday - the pain of the past.

0:00:16.860,0:00:20.580
Looking back will hinder you from looking forward.

0:00:20.580,0:00:23.780
You cannot look back and look forward at the same time - it is not possible.

0:00:23.780,0:00:27.200
See!

0:00:27.200,0:00:37.160
That is our life. Our life is....

0:00:37.160,0:00:50.540
That is, in not forgiving and forgetting the pain of the past, your life is...

0:00:50.540,0:01:01.320
But when you forget and forgive the pain of the past...

0:01:01.320,0:01:05.220
Can you rise up and demonstrate this  to yourself. Speak to yourself.

0:01:05.220,0:01:14.520
Say, "For me not to forgive the pain of the past, and forget and forgive,

0:01:14.520,0:01:23.300
my life will remain...

0:01:23.300,0:01:31.240
Do it!

0:01:31.240,0:01:42.700
But if you are now ready to forget and forgive the pain of the past, your life...
