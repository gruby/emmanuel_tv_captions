0:00:00.020,0:00:03.580
Praise the Lord!

0:00:03.580,0:00:07.820
Children of God, praise the Lord!

0:00:07.820,0:00:13.300
If you are happy to be in the presence of God, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus.

0:00:13.300,0:00:17.040
If you believe today is the day that the Lord has made in your life,

0:00:17.040,0:00:21.140
put your hands together for our Lord Jesus!

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:25.720,0:00:31.920
Greet your neighbor, "Good morning".

0:00:31.920,0:00:38.260
Viewers all over the world, we want to greet you once again - Good morning, in Jesus' name!

0:00:38.260,0:00:40.900
Good morning to your health!

0:00:40.900,0:00:43.140

0:00:47.820,0:00:53.060
Good morning to your life, in Jesus' name!

0:00:53.060,0:00:54.760
Hallelujah!

0:00:54.760,0:00:57.620
You may be seated in the presence of God.

0:00:57.620,0:01:00.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:00.800,0:01:07.140
Tell your neighbor, "It is a new dawn".

0:01:07.140,0:01:10.840
It is a new dawn.

0:01:10.840,0:01:21.560
The Bible says that if anything is in Christ, it's a new creation.

0:01:21.560,0:01:33.120
In the mind of God, the old man has stopped being; the new man has taken his place.

0:01:33.120,0:01:36.340
My name is Yinka.

0:01:36.340,0:01:38.700
Today by the grace of God, I want to tell you

0:01:38.700,0:01:43.040
that whatever unpleasant situation that you may be facing,

0:01:43.040,0:01:47.140
whatever seems impossible in your life -

0:01:47.140,0:01:54.420
get ready because the Holy Spirit will make it possible, in Jesus' name!

0:01:54.420,0:02:03.500
In the Book of Genesis 1:3, when God said, "Let there be light",

0:02:03.500,0:02:11.660
the Bible says, He trusted His Word and there was light.

0:02:11.660,0:02:17.100
He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.

0:02:17.100,0:02:22.420
He was not speaking out of things that were already in existence

0:02:22.420,0:02:29.000
but of things that are yet unseen;

0:02:29.000,0:02:34.540
things that look naturally impossible.

0:02:34.540,0:02:42.060
His expression showed that whatever God ordered or or decreed out of faith,

0:02:42.060,0:02:44.480
came into being.

0:02:44.480,0:02:48.200
I don't know the challenges that you are facing this morning, brethren.

0:02:48.200,0:02:53.440
And I don't know the mountain that surrounds you.

0:02:53.440,0:03:00.180
But I tell you, if you can exercise that absolute faith that God had in His Word

0:03:00.180,0:03:05.000
when creating you, you can say to your mountain, "Move!"

0:03:05.000,0:03:13.500
With faith in your heart, without doubt, you will move the impossible.

0:03:13.500,0:03:15.940
Tell your neighbour, "Trust".

0:03:15.940,0:03:23.520
Trust - move the impossible!

0:03:23.520,0:03:28.780
The Bible says that everyone is endowed with something within

0:03:28.780,0:03:33.820
that needs to be transferred to the outside.

0:03:33.820,0:03:38.740
You have been endowed with something within

0:03:38.740,0:03:42.840
that needs to be transferred to the outside.

0:03:42.840,0:03:49.440
It is easy to say, "I am a faith man" and continue to hope for years.

0:03:49.440,0:03:56.120
As long as you continue hoping, the Bible says it will always be beyond you

0:03:56.120,0:04:04.080
until you add substance to your hope and receive Christ by faith.

0:04:04.080,0:04:10.540
The Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for.

0:04:10.540,0:04:15.920
Faith is the substance of things we hope for.

0:04:15.920,0:04:23.080
Faith and hope, the Bible says, go together.

0:04:23.080,0:04:26.600
The problem of our faith, brethren, is not far from the fact that

0:04:26.600,0:04:33.000
we fail to add substance to our hope and receive Christ by faith.

0:04:33.000,0:04:40.120
And that is why the Book of James says that faith is to be expressed through works.

0:04:40.120,0:04:45.460
Faith without works, the Bible says, is dead.

0:04:45.460,0:04:54.440
But don't forget that it is your works that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.

0:04:54.440,0:05:04.320
It is your actions that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.

0:05:04.320,0:05:12.640
It is your deeds that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.

0:05:12.640,0:05:19.220
Therefore faith is perfected by our acting on the Word of God.

0:05:19.220,0:05:24.020
Faith can be likened to the soup you prepare in your various homes.

0:05:24.020,0:05:27.260
I know we have a lot of shelves in the house.

0:05:27.260,0:05:31.680
We have a lot of people who know how to make soup.

0:05:31.680,0:05:35.740
Those ingredients you put together to make soup

0:05:35.740,0:05:41.760
are what the Bible refers to as substance.

0:05:41.760,0:05:45.380
I quickly want to ask one or two people here.

0:05:45.380,0:05:48.520
If you can just tell us,

0:05:48.520,0:05:53.140
if you would like to make a local dish, I mean soup,

0:05:53.140,0:05:56.760
can you tell us - what are the two or three ingredients you put together to make a soup.

0:05:56.760,0:06:01.760
I believe you are going to represent all the good cooks, good chefs here.

0:06:01.760,0:06:06.740
Tell us two or three ingredients you put together.

0:06:06.740,0:06:18.680
Well, I like tomato soup so I will take onions and also chicken and maggie.

0:06:18.680,0:06:20.380
That is good.

0:06:20.380,0:06:24.200
Our sister just told us about four different ingredients

0:06:24.200,0:06:28.780
that she, on her own, will put together to make a beautiful soup.

0:06:28.780,0:06:31.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:31.640,0:06:36.960
You know you can make your soup in different ways and still have wonderful results.

0:06:36.960,0:06:42.880
Now in faith, those ingredients you put together,

0:06:42.880,0:06:48.840
I mean those substances that you put together to make a right result,

0:06:48.840,0:06:52.220
in faith, the Bible refers to them as trust.

0:06:52.220,0:06:55.320
This maggie, chicken you are talking about,

0:06:55.320,0:07:07.360
the Bible refers to them as confidence, obedience, patience, perseverance, endurance.

0:07:07.360,0:07:11.680
These are the instruments of faith.

0:07:11.680,0:07:19.260
The Bible refers to them as works.

0:07:19.260,0:07:23.280
Today we want to move impossibilities in our lives

0:07:23.280,0:07:33.580
but we fail to consider those ingredients, substances that we need to activate our faith.

0:07:33.580,0:07:38.000
Our hearts desire breakthrough but we don't seem to understand

0:07:38.000,0:07:46.480
that we need to add those substances, ingredients to activate our faith.

0:07:46.480,0:07:54.120
In the Book of Genesis 15, the Bible says that Abraham understood this principle.

0:07:54.120,0:08:02.440
When God promised that he was going to father many nations at his old age,

0:08:02.440,0:08:08.500
the Bible says he trusted God that He would keep His Word.

0:08:08.500,0:08:17.260
What God valued in Abraham was the trust he had in his ability to do the impossible.

0:08:17.260,0:08:22.420
Abraham trusted God that He would do the impossible

0:08:22.420,0:08:25.920
and that was what God valued so much in him.

0:08:25.920,0:08:31.760
Tell your neighbor,  "Trust - move the impossible".

0:08:31.760,0:08:35.480
And that will be the title of our message today.

0:08:35.480,0:08:42.220
I would like to go to the Book of James 2 as our proof text.

0:08:42.220,0:08:48.320
The Book of James 2 and let's take our reading from verse 14.

0:08:48.320,0:08:50.640
Now I read.

0:08:50.640,0:08:59.860
What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?

0:08:59.860,0:09:04.400
Can faith save him?

0:09:04.400,0:09:11.400
If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,

0:09:11.400,0:09:16.800
and one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,"

0:09:16.800,0:09:25.260
but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?

0:09:25.260,0:09:32.880
Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

0:09:32.880,0:09:39.400
But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works".

0:09:39.400,0:09:46.140
Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works.

0:09:46.140,0:09:48.740
You believe that there is one God.

0:09:48.740,0:09:51.020
You do well.

0:09:51.020,0:09:56.180
Even the demons believe - and tremble!

0:09:56.180,0:10:03.820
But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?

0:10:03.820,0:10:11.300
Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works when he offered Isaac, his son, on the altar?

0:10:11.300,0:10:14.480
Do you see that faith was working together with his works,

0:10:14.480,0:10:18.900
and by works, faith was made perfect?

0:10:18.900,0:10:21.220
Verse 23.

0:10:21.220,0:10:25.320
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says

0:10:25.320,0:10:31.120
"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness".

0:10:31.120,0:10:35.620
And he was called the friend of God.

0:10:35.620,0:10:38.880
The last verse for this proof text.

0:10:38.880,0:10:40.300
Verse 24.

0:10:40.300,0:10:48.600
You see then that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.

0:10:48.600,0:10:53.580
Tell your neighbor, "A man is justified by works".

0:10:53.580,0:11:00.760
I will be justified by my works and not by faith alone.

0:11:00.760,0:11:06.680
Trusting in God does not consist in prayer alone.

0:11:06.680,0:11:15.160
There are times that we pray in faith and there are times that we aren't in faith.

0:11:15.160,0:11:23.160
I mean there are things that we must do ourselves and others we expect from God.

0:11:23.160,0:11:27.140
There are things that we must do ourselves

0:11:27.140,0:11:33.020
and there are some things that we will expect from God.

0:11:33.020,0:11:37.620
We all have sent our petitions to God.

0:11:37.620,0:11:43.540
We all have sent our requests and our heart's desires to God.

0:11:43.540,0:11:54.960
It is high time for you to sit back in faith to hear what God has to say about your situation.

0:11:54.960,0:12:07.720
In this process, brethren, you need to add trust, patience, perseverance, obedience

0:12:07.720,0:12:15.300
as substance to your hope and activate your faith.

0:12:15.300,0:12:20.920
Prophet TB Joshua says, "Prayer for any special object

0:12:20.920,0:12:25.900
must be followed by an absolute trust in the Father

0:12:25.900,0:12:31.780
that He is working out the answer".

0:12:31.780,0:12:35.020
Prayer for any special object.

0:12:35.020,0:12:52.500
Faith is not a legalistic formula created and accepted by man.

0:12:52.500,0:12:56.240
God responds to faith and not formula.

0:12:56.240,0:13:03.400
Faith is not an issue of ordering God around as many do today.

0:13:03.400,0:13:05.320
What do I mean?

0:13:05.320,0:13:11.420
We are ordering God around when we do not know God's will for our lives

0:13:11.420,0:13:14.760
and we continue to pray.

0:13:14.760,0:13:20.060
Remember God's will means God's promises for our lives.

0:13:20.060,0:13:25.060
That is why you see people murmuring, complaining

0:13:25.060,0:13:28.840
when the answer to their prayers seems to delay in coming.

0:13:28.840,0:13:36.220
They begin to seek for shortcuts, alternatives, beating the gun.

0:13:36.220,0:13:44.720
Brethren, you must always understand that when God is executing His plans in your life,

0:13:44.720,0:13:51.760
He also designs and arranges events which will continue to unfold

0:13:51.760,0:13:57.060
until His purpose is revealed in your life.

0:13:57.060,0:13:58.920
Now take note of this:

0:13:58.928,0:14:01.060
God promises.

0:14:01.060,0:14:05.360
I know God must have promised us a lot of things.

0:14:05.360,0:14:14.100
God promises. He Himself also designs.

0:14:14.100,0:14:22.260
He creates, He plans before fulfilling those promises in your life.

0:14:22.260,0:14:28.040
He designs events of your life as Christians.

0:14:28.040,0:14:32.420
Those events could be the unpleasant situation that you are going through.

0:14:32.420,0:14:37.920
I mean, those plans could be the challenges, persecution,

0:14:37.920,0:14:41.980
that you may be going through right now.

0:14:41.980,0:14:48.040
Brethren, if God allowed it as He did Job and a host of others,

0:14:48.040,0:14:54.700
do not think it strange and doubt your Guard.

0:14:54.700,0:15:02.380
If God allowed it, you must not consider it unusual or abnormal.

0:15:02.380,0:15:07.520
If God allowed that unpleasant situation, you must not consider it odd

0:15:07.520,0:15:12.080
and begin to question your faith.

0:15:12.080,0:15:16.220
When some do not see beyond their immediate situation -

0:15:16.220,0:15:22.720
you know as man, they want to plan themselves because they can't wait for God's time.

0:15:22.720,0:15:29.080
They want to design themselves; if possible, execute their own plan themselves

0:15:29.080,0:15:33.480
whereas they are the work of art.

0:15:33.480,0:15:44.960
The Book of Genesis 22 says that Abraham moved and did the impossible.

0:15:44.960,0:15:50.800
When God instructed him to sacrifice his only child,

0:15:50.800,0:15:55.440
Abraham knew that Isaac was a child of promise.

0:15:55.440,0:16:00.360
Abraham realized that God would not delight Himself

0:16:00.360,0:16:07.440
in breaking the covenant by killing the object of promise.

0:16:07.440,0:16:15.060
And that is why when Isaac asked his father in that verse 7,

0:16:15.060,0:16:19.960
"Father, you said we are going for sacrifice.

0:16:19.960,0:16:26.220
But this is wood and this is fire.

0:16:26.220,0:16:31.440
But, father, tell me, where is the lamb for the offering?"

0:16:31.440,0:16:44.480
Abraham said to Isaac, "My son, the Lord would provide for Himself the lamb for the offering".

0:16:44.480,0:16:50.340
The Bible says immediately, the Holy Spirit affected his word

0:16:50.340,0:16:57.600
and his word became an instrument of victory.

0:16:57.600,0:17:02.780
Obeying God at first seems hard

0:17:02.780,0:17:08.980
until we come to realize that all He asks is for our good -

0:17:08.980,0:17:14.000
He makes life full and free for us.

0:17:14.000,0:17:18.560
Tell your neighbor, "It honors God to believe Him".

0:17:18.560,0:17:32.920
It honors God to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him.

0:17:32.920,0:17:42.480
For example, we have seen someone who had been promised of being a bank manager

0:17:42.480,0:17:47.260
and finally receives a sack letter as a clerk.

0:17:47.260,0:17:55.640
Little did he know that that sack letter was to reveal the purpose of God for his life.

0:17:55.640,0:18:05.240
We have seen many gardeners who finally became managing directors of companies.

0:18:05.240,0:18:13.380
We have seen a prisoner who finally became a president of a nation.

0:18:13.380,0:18:21.880
We have indeed seen a servant yesterday who finally became a leader today.

0:18:21.880,0:18:34.660
Tell your neighbor, "It honors God to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him".

0:18:34.660,0:18:36.260
What is your situation?

0:18:36.260,0:18:41.780
Remember, crossing the Red Sea was an impossible task in the natural.

0:18:41.780,0:18:45.860
The Bible says the Red Sea was against the free movement

0:18:45.860,0:18:50.220
of the Israelites into the Promised Land.

0:18:50.220,0:18:54.680
The Red Sea was against their success.

0:18:54.680,0:19:01.280
The Red Sea was against their free movement but Moses looked beyond it

0:19:01.280,0:19:05.280
and moved the impossible.

0:19:05.280,0:19:09.920
I want you to begin to say right now with faith in your hearts

0:19:09.920,0:19:15.540
that whatever Red Sea stands against me and my success -

0:19:15.540,0:19:21.080
say it with all your heart because the Holy Spirit will affect your word right now

0:19:21.080,0:19:24.520
and that word will become an instrument.

0:19:24.520,0:19:30.060
Say, "Whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my success,

0:19:30.060,0:19:34.780
whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my freedom,

0:19:34.780,0:19:39.200
whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my success,

0:19:39.200,0:19:42.280
in the name of Jesus Christ, give way!

0:19:42.280,0:19:45.960
In the name of Jesus Christ, begin to give way!

0:19:45.960,0:19:48.140
Say it with all your heart

0:19:48.140,0:19:51.180
because the Holy Spirit will affect you right now

0:19:51.180,0:19:58.020
and that word will  bring about your victory today, in the name of Jesus Christ!

In Jesus' mighty name!

For those who want to see before they believe,

0:20:08.960,0:20:13.100
I want to tell you - remember what the Bible says in the Book of John 20:29

0:20:13.100,0:20:19.260
that blessed are those who have not yet seen but believe.

0:20:19.260,0:20:26.200
For faith based on what is seen lacks the quality of being stable.

0:20:26.200,0:20:33.040
2 Corinthians 5:7 says, "For we walk by faith, not by sight".

0:20:33.040,0:20:40.880
It is faith that sees the invisible - what the ordinary eyes cannot see.

0:20:40.880,0:20:45.540
It is faith that moves the impossible.

0:20:45.540,0:20:50.980
It is faith that receives the incredible.

0:20:50.980,0:20:57.020
Tell your neighbor, "Trust and move the impossible".

0:20:57.020,0:21:03.100
Trust - move the impossible, in Jesus' name!

0:21:03.100,0:21:12.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:12.260,0:21:18.680
Remember the Jewish brothers in the Book of Daniel 3.

0:21:18.680,0:21:34.300
The Bible says a believing heart produces right behavior, good words as a proof of faith.

0:21:34.300,0:21:45.100
A believing heart produces right behavior, good words as a proof of faith.

0:21:45.100,0:21:53.360
Right words, right behavior that honour Jesus

0:21:53.360,0:21:57.840
reveal that faith is already lodged in the heart.

0:21:57.840,0:22:01.460
In Daniel 3 from verse 17 to 18,

0:22:01.460,0:22:09.780
when Nebuchadnezzar threatened  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego with fire,

0:22:09.780,0:22:15.700
the Bible says they trusted the God of the impossibilities

0:22:15.700,0:22:18.940
and that is why they were bold to say to the king,

0:22:18.940,0:22:27.240
"O King, we want you to know that if we are thrown inside this fiery furnace,

0:22:27.240,0:22:38.820
our God is able, more than able, to rescue us, to deliver us and to set us free.

0:22:38.820,0:22:43.420
But if he does not, we want you to know, o Majesty,

0:22:43.420,0:22:50.340
that we will not serve your gods or your image that you have set up".

0:22:50.340,0:22:55.780
The Bible says the Holy Spirit affected their word.

0:22:55.780,0:23:03.240
That word that they spoke rose above the law of nature

0:23:03.240,0:23:11.440
and turned the fiery furnace ice-cold because that word was spoken from the heart.

0:23:11.440,0:23:18.720
The Word of God in their hearts rose above the law of nature

0:23:18.720,0:23:24.240
and turned the fiery furnace ice-cold.

0:23:24.240,0:23:28.240
So, brethren, what is your situation?

0:23:28.240,0:23:33.840
I don't know the unpleasant circumstances that you are facing right now.

0:23:33.840,0:23:39.400
I don't know the mountain surrounding you.

0:23:39.400,0:23:42.300
I don't know the situation in your career.

0:23:42.300,0:23:47.740
Or perhaps you have received a report that says, "It is incurable".

0:23:47.740,0:23:50.300
But I want you to know one thing:

0:23:50.300,0:23:57.400
The Word of God on your lips today as believers will rise against the law of nature

0:23:57.400,0:24:07.340
and make that impossibility in your life possible, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:24:07.340,0:24:13.220
Remember, the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword.

0:24:13.220,0:24:22.760
When you experience situations that seem contrary to the promise of God for your life,

0:24:22.760,0:24:30.020
always remember it is an opportunity to cultivate an attitude of Christ Jesus.

0:24:30.020,0:24:33.680
As far as we live, tests and trials will come;

0:24:33.680,0:24:42.340
when they come, it is an opportunity for you to cultivate an attitude of Christ Jesus.

0:24:42.340,0:24:45.660
Stay focused!

0:24:45.660,0:24:47.760
Be calm!

0:24:47.760,0:24:51.140
Don't take a step back!

0:24:51.140,0:24:57.200
Stay steady even when everything around you is unsteady.

0:24:57.200,0:25:07.120
Always remember that there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

0:25:07.120,0:25:13.380
The tests that come from Jesus always help our character development.

0:25:13.380,0:25:26.280
The Bible says that God oftentimes uses hard times to produce maturity and humility in us.

0:25:26.280,0:25:37.320
God oftentimes uses hard times to produce maturity, humility and completeness in us

0:25:37.320,0:25:41.160
so that we can share in His holiness

0:25:41.160,0:25:51.620
and be equipped to enjoy the peace and righteousness in Christ Jesus.

0:25:51.620,0:25:58.360
Viewers all over the world, those who are under the influence of this telecast,

0:25:58.360,0:26:01.840
the way out:

0:26:01.840,0:26:07.400
The first step of our work of faith is to stop our own work,

0:26:07.400,0:26:17.420
to stop our own plan, and rest on God's love, power and wisdom.

0:26:17.420,0:26:23.640
Tests and trials will come as long as we live.

0:26:23.640,0:26:29.740
But when they come, don't be troubled.

0:26:29.740,0:26:40.100
Be focused, be steady, even when everything around you is unsteady.

0:26:40.100,0:26:47.380
Finally, brethren, turn with me quickly to the Book of Hebrews 12

0:26:47.380,0:26:53.660
and let's quickly take our reading from verse 1 to 2.

0:26:53.660,0:27:02.460
"Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,

0:27:02.460,0:27:09.040
let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us,

0:27:09.040,0:27:16.120
and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us."

0:27:16.120,0:27:17.460
Verse 2.

0:27:17.460,0:27:25.580
"Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him

0:27:25.580,0:27:36.060
endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."

0:27:36.060,0:27:41.160
Praise the Lord!

0:27:41.160,0:27:49.260
Brethren, it is the right time for you to identify those things

0:27:49.260,0:27:54.960
that may hinder your movement towards God.

0:27:54.960,0:27:57.320
We are in the presence of God.

0:27:57.320,0:28:04.580
Remember, it is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to you.

0:28:04.580,0:28:13.740
It is high time that we sit down to identify those things

0:28:13.740,0:28:19.600
that may hinder our movement towards God.

0:28:19.600,0:28:37.540
It could be impatience, disobedience, anger, insensitive words, perhaps hatred.

0:28:37.540,0:28:39.860
Identify them.

0:28:39.860,0:28:48.420
I pray the Holy Spirit will help our weakness and turn it to the strength of God, in Jesus' name.

0:28:48.420,0:28:51.240
No matter what your yesterday was like,

0:28:51.240,0:28:54.660
tell your neighbor, "The best is yet to come".

0:28:54.660,0:29:01.980
No matter what my yesterday was like, the best is yet to come.

0:29:01.980,0:29:08.120
Indeed, the best is yet to come.

0:29:08.120,0:29:12.420
I want to use this opportunity to thank my father in the Lord

0:29:12.420,0:29:17.920
whom God is using mightily in the entire world,

0:29:17.920,0:29:24.180
for his endless efforts in my life.

0:29:24.180,0:29:30.760
I never believed I could be part of this glorious grace

0:29:30.760,0:29:36.140
because I am an embodiment of the impossible.

0:29:36.140,0:29:39.180
Here I am today.

0:29:39.180,0:29:43.280
All glory to His name!

0:29:43.280,0:29:47.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:47.780,0:29:50.400
There is hope!

0:29:50.400,0:29:56.420
Brethren, Jesus is the hope.

0:29:56.420,0:30:02.540
That same God that turned my misery into success today,

0:30:02.540,0:30:06.160
that turned my name to success,

0:30:06.160,0:30:11.640
will turn every impossibility in your life possible, in the name of Jesus!

0:30:11.640,0:30:19.480
That same God will turn your failure to success, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:30:19.480,0:30:24.540
That same God will turn your sickness into good health!

0:30:24.540,0:30:33.960
That same God will turn your mess into a message, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:30:33.960,0:30:44.260
That same God will turn your test into a testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:30:44.260,0:30:51.400
May the Lord bless His Word, in Jesus' name!
