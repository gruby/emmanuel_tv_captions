0:00:00.000,0:00:10.140
Viewers all over the world, I know you are feeling his presence.

0:00:10.140,0:00:14.760
Where can we go from his presence?

0:00:14.760,0:00:17.000
Give thanks to God

We have many people here today that are waiting for healing.

0:00:31.500,0:00:41.600
As we were dancing, singing - they were unable because of the pain and affliction.

0:00:41.600,0:00:55.540
I think the best way to celebrate this Palm Sunday [April 9, 2017] is to bless them with healing and deliverance.

0:00:55.540,0:01:00.900
So that the coming one, they can be happy to celebrate it.

0:01:00.900,0:01:04.000
That is the purpose of Palm Sunday.

0:01:04.000,0:01:05.100
Really.

0:01:05.100,0:01:08.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:08.240,0:01:15.160
Make sure people are happy, just as you are.

0:01:15.160,0:01:17.940
Are you happy?

0:01:17.940,0:01:20.560
I can't hear you.

0:01:20.560,0:01:24.360
Tell your neighbour: I want to make sure you are happy as I am!

0:01:24.360,0:01:26.800
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]

0:01:26.800,0:01:28.480
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:28.480,0:01:30.940
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]

0:01:30.940,0:01:32.960
Tell the viewers all over the world.

0:01:32.960,0:01:35.780
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am]

0:01:35.780,0:01:38.460
Tell the viewers all over the world - they are there.

0:01:38.460,0:01:40.920
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]

0:01:40.920,0:01:44.040
Those on the sickbed.

0:01:44.040,0:01:48.080
Many are on the sickbed, and they are watching you.

0:01:48.080,0:01:49.500
Can you please tell them:

0:01:49.500,0:01:52.360
You want to make sure that they are happy as you are.

0:01:52.360,0:01:55.260
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]

0:01:55.260,0:01:58.440
Many are in the prison yard. Tell them

0:01:58.440,0:02:02.580
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]

0:02:02.580,0:02:06.660
Those watching the programme, tell them.

0:02:06.660,0:02:09.740
[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]

0:02:09.740,0:02:11.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:11.340,0:02:16.500
You can only give that happiness when you have it.

0:02:16.500,0:02:20.200
That is why Christians have to be happy.

0:02:20.200,0:02:23.300
When you are not happy, you cannot give.

0:02:23.300,0:02:26.340
It is what you have that you can give out of.

0:02:26.340,0:02:30.380
You cannot give all - you can only give out of what you have.

0:02:30.380,0:02:32.020
When you are not happy, you cannot.

0:02:32.020,0:02:36.760
Even when you give money - when you are not happy and you now give money to your neighbour,

0:02:36.760,0:02:38.520
it is like you are giving sorrow.

0:02:38.520,0:02:42.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:42.120,0:02:45.380
When you are not happy and you are rich

0:02:45.380,0:02:49.320
and your neighbor runs to you for help and you are not happy,

0:02:49.320,0:02:54.380
whatever you give out of that unhappiness is sorrow.

0:02:54.380,0:02:59.760
Your neighbour cannot use it for anything.

0:02:59.760,0:03:04.800
Therefore, what you've been giving in the past - think about it.

0:03:04.800,0:03:08.320
The mood you were in when you were giving those things.

0:03:08.320,0:03:17.540
Whatever you give that is not joyful is not from God.

0:03:17.540,0:03:19.540
Happiness can only come from God.

0:03:19.540,0:03:25.260
Whatever that is out of unhappiness is not from God.

0:03:25.260,0:03:32.920
If you pretend to smile and you are not happy - that is not from God.

0:03:32.920,0:03:36.960
This is why many things you are giving out - there is no reward from God -

0:03:36.960,0:03:41.540
because you are not giving it out of happiness.

0:03:41.540,0:03:47.360
You are giving something and after giving it, you are now saying to yourself,

0:03:47.360,0:03:51.280
"Oh! Had I known, I would not have given this.

0:03:51.280,0:03:56.980
Oh, my God. Well, I have to give it because they will do this or that to me".

0:03:56.980,0:04:00.300
It means you are not giving it out of God.

0:04:00.300,0:04:07.000
You cannot expect a reward from God and God is the rewarder.

0:04:07.000,0:04:12.860
Or you greet a brother of yours, "Good morning, sir!"

0:04:12.860,0:04:21.000
He says, "Oh, thank you!" After your brother turns his back, you do this...

0:04:21.000,0:04:27.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:27.640,0:04:31.740
Can you see why you have not been receiving rewards.

0:04:31.740,0:04:35.080
You are a good giver but no rewards.

0:04:35.080,0:04:43.020
Or in the past, you trained many people to university, to college, you assisted many.

0:04:43.020,0:04:48.800
In those days, many of your younger ones lived with you.

0:04:48.800,0:04:52.960
You trained them. Now some of them have become great.

0:04:52.960,0:05:03.500
If you remember when you were training them, you gave out of unhappiness.

0:05:03.500,0:05:09.260
Some of them when you gave them money, you threw it - "I have to give you, stupid boy!"

0:05:09.260,0:05:14.060
"Foolish boy!" You just had to give them.

0:05:14.060,0:05:24.900
Today they are becoming great - but something is telling them that they should just leave you the way you are.

0:05:24.900,0:05:29.620
If you had given all those things out of God...

0:05:29.620,0:05:32.900
God is the rewarder.

0:05:32.900,0:05:35.380
You have not been helping out of God.

0:05:35.380,0:05:41.820
You help but not out of God.

0:05:41.820,0:05:46.960
You give but not out of God.

0:05:46.960,0:05:50.800
You give out of complaining.

0:05:50.800,0:05:55.300
You greet out of complaining, grumbling.

0:05:55.300,0:06:06.300
You smile out of grumbling.

0:06:06.300,0:06:11.360
It is better not to give than to give out of grumbling.

0:06:11.360,0:06:18.040
You help someone with millions of dollars out of grumbling.

0:06:18.040,0:06:21.580
You cannot expect a reward from God.

0:06:21.580,0:06:24.720
Your grumbling is not of God.

0:06:24.720,0:06:31.760
The act that follows that help will determine the kind of help you give.

0:06:31.760,0:06:34.040
I want to help you. How are you?

0:06:34.040,0:06:35.720
Let me help you!

0:06:35.720,0:06:42.180
It is not that help that matters but the force that follows that help.

0:06:42.180,0:06:49.380
It's not that help I'm doing but the force behind it will determine the kind of reward I will receive.

0:06:49.380,0:06:55.140
But people seeing us will say, "Oh, this man is very kind. He helped this man to stand up.

0:06:55.140,0:06:57.600
Look at him - very humble".

0:06:57.600,0:07:01.500
"Let's go." The man cannot walk. "Oh, very humble."

0:07:01.500,0:07:02.680
What is wrong with you?

0:07:02.680,0:07:05.660
Thank you. The man cannot walk.

0:07:05.660,0:07:07.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:07.660,0:07:13.060
This man - eh! Everything - "Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit!"

0:07:13.060,0:07:25.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:25.780,0:07:29.920
You see me. Maybe I am just wearing a simple dress.

0:07:29.920,0:07:33.000
You are not expecting me to wear this and you say, "The man is humble".

0:07:33.000,0:07:36.660
Who told you I am humble because I wear a rag?

0:07:36.660,0:07:40.720
I can be very proud and at the same time wear a simple thing.

0:07:40.720,0:07:46.000
It is not what you see but the force behind what you see.

0:07:46.000,0:07:47.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:07:47.220,0:07:51.100
[It is not what you see but the force behind what you see.]

0:07:51.100,0:07:52.320
I can't hear you.

0:07:52.320,0:07:55.340
[It is not what you see but the force behind what you see.]

0:07:55.340,0:08:02.460
This is why the Bible says: We don't walk by sight; we walk by faith.

0:08:02.460,0:08:06.580
What I am seeing now - "A very humble, gentle man."

0:08:06.580,0:08:11.940
"Look at the simple dress."

0:08:11.940,0:08:18.020
Do you know the force behind what he is doing?

0:08:18.020,0:08:19.840
Look at money.

0:08:19.840,0:08:25.380
If you put blood money down and clean money, would you be able to know the difference?

0:08:25.380,0:08:28.660
When there is no blood on the money?

0:08:28.660,0:08:34.940
Maybe someone just went out to rob, killed the person and carried millions of dollars

0:08:34.940,0:08:38.360
and now wants to use this as charity.

0:08:38.360,0:08:41.020
But it is money you will see -

0:08:41.020,0:08:50.180
you don't know where he brought the money from, and the money is clean as well as the godly one.

0:08:50.180,0:08:55.220
If you now see them side by side, you won't know the difference.

0:08:55.220,0:09:01.500
It is the force behind the money that determines the type of money it is.

0:09:01.500,0:09:05.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:05.980,0:09:10.260
The force behind a man determines the type of man he is.

0:09:10.260,0:09:16.400
"A very humble man, what a godly man" - and yet he is not godly.

0:09:16.400,0:09:22.980
"He is a leader, he likes God - a humble and very good man."

0:09:22.980,0:09:25.280
Who told you he is good, who told you he is humble?

0:09:25.280,0:09:34.520
It is the force, and this force - we cannot see it with our eyes.

0:09:34.520,0:09:39.580
It is the force that determines the reward.

0:09:39.580,0:09:47.160
This is why sometimes you say, "This man is trying to work hard; why is he suffering?"

0:09:47.160,0:09:50.860
Who told you he is trying, he works hard

0:09:50.860,0:09:58.060
when we are not judged by what we see but what we cannot see.

0:09:58.060,0:10:03.660
As a believer, you are not judged by going to church, by reading the Bible.

0:10:03.660,0:10:09.960
This is why we say "spirit of humility", "spirit of goodness".

0:10:09.960,0:10:18.820
If those spirits are removed, anybody can demonstrate whatever you call it.

0:10:18.820,0:10:21.880
You can pretend to be humble.

0:10:21.880,0:10:27.300
The spirit behind it would determine whether you are pretending or not.

0:10:27.300,0:10:31.360
People like me, I'm scared when it is time for thanksgiving

0:10:31.360,0:10:35.220
because I don't know where you are coming from - with your money.

0:10:35.220,0:10:38.580
Many can come with blood money.

0:10:38.580,0:10:44.700
When it is time for offering, they would raise their offering whereas it is blood money.

0:10:44.700,0:10:48.380
What can the man of God use that kind of blood money for?

0:10:48.380,0:10:51.920
Is he going to bless the man?

0:10:51.920,0:10:58.500
This is why we, ministers of God, have so much to do.

0:10:58.500,0:11:07.480
Tell your neighbour: What we received from our members as offering at thanksgiving is killing us.

0:11:07.480,0:11:13.020
[What we received from our members as offering at thanksgiving is killing us.]

0:11:13.020,0:11:17.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:17.160,0:11:27.580
When you see money carried in the church - offering money - the bowl is full of money,

0:11:27.580,0:11:39.640
inside that - there is good and killer inside.

0:11:39.640,0:11:44.620
Wicked people like the pastor to ask.

0:11:44.620,0:11:47.320
When the pastor does not ask, they cannot give.

0:11:47.320,0:11:51.860
When the pastor does not ask and recognise them, they cannot give.

0:11:51.860,0:11:55.420
They like praise, they like recognition.

0:11:55.420,0:12:02.300
If you want to do away and avoid these people, these people will not put money inside.

0:12:02.300,0:12:07.040
Don't praise them! Let them know it is to God they give and not to you.

0:12:07.040,0:12:09.520
Don't even receive it directly!

0:12:09.520,0:12:12.320
If you don't receive something directly from the killer,

0:12:12.320,0:12:18.060
the killer will not give you because he wants to be recognised.

0:12:18.060,0:12:22.180
They like praise - that is their reward - because they have no reward from God.

0:12:22.180,0:12:28.920
Their reward is that praise to know them and to recognise them; it is their reward.

0:12:28.920,0:12:34.920
What comes from God goes to God.

0:12:34.920,0:12:38.520
If what you have is from God, it will go to God.

0:12:38.520,0:12:46.620
You don't need any recognition from the pastor - whatever you want to give to God, you give.

0:12:46.620,0:12:48.600
Look at me, I'm moving.

0:12:48.600,0:12:53.200
It's not this movement that matters but the force behind this movement

0:12:53.200,0:12:58.080
determines whether I am moving of God or I am moving of satan.

0:12:58.080,0:13:02.480
Now I want to pray for this man. I am walking towards him.

0:13:02.480,0:13:06.220
This movement does not matter but the force - who is leading you,

0:13:06.220,0:13:14.040
what force is behind this move - it will determine the reward!

0:13:14.040,0:13:18.500

0:13:18.500,0:13:24.480
No one can get healed without faith.

0:13:24.480,0:13:34.940
If I am coming and I have doubt in my heart - "Will this man be healed?" - and that doubt fills my heart,

0:13:34.940,0:13:40.000
if I pray for this man, I will ask him to come back tomorrow.

0:13:40.000,0:13:47.680
That is the method of doubt - "Come back again tomorrow and let us see your condition."

0:13:47.680,0:14:00.180
When faith is now, faith acts now, believes now, confesses now.

0:14:00.180,0:14:02.300
Faith acts now.

0:14:02.300,0:14:03.360
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:03.360,0:14:05.680
[Faith acts now.]

0:14:05.680,0:14:07.880
Faith heals now.

0:14:07.880,0:14:10.020
Faith delivers now.

0:14:10.020,0:14:11.960
Faith blesses now.

0:14:11.960,0:14:14.900
That is faith!

0:14:14.900,0:14:21.300
Faith is present tense.

0:14:21.300,0:14:31.280
And if you're not of God - there's no neutral place - if you are not of God, you are of satan.

0:14:31.280,0:14:33.940
If you are of God, then you will be filled with faith

0:14:33.940,0:14:38.780
because only faith moves, talks and walks with Him.

0:14:38.780,0:14:43.480
If you are not of God, you will be filled with doubt.

0:14:43.480,0:14:45.140
I want to pray with you.

0:14:45.140,0:14:51.700
Doubt: "Will this prayer be answered? Would God answer me?" Because I am not of Him.

0:14:51.700,0:14:55.280
If I now pray, it's not going to happen.

0:14:55.280,0:14:59.000
The only excuse I will give you is to come back.

0:14:59.000,0:15:05.260

Don't let us deceive ourselves.

0:15:08.420,0:15:13.060
90% of your action cannot be judged on the outside

0:15:13.060,0:15:22.140
but the force behind your action determines where your action comes from.

0:15:22.140,0:15:25.580
Everybody says, "In the name of Jesus!"

0:15:25.580,0:15:29.380
They cannot just because of that say that they are calling Jesus.

0:15:29.380,0:15:34.760
You can be calling Jesus but the force behind that calling is of satan.

0:15:34.760,0:15:39.460
You don't need a licence to call the name Jesus.

0:15:39.460,0:15:44.620
But whenever you call Him genuinely, you need a licence from Jesus.

0:15:44.620,0:15:51.080
When you call Jesus genuinely, you need what? - Licence.

0:15:51.080,0:15:56.220
A licence means you will be adopted by the Holy Spirit to call that name genuinely.

0:15:56.220,0:15:59.400
In the same vein, you are free to have a copy of the Bible.

0:15:59.400,0:16:04.360
All you need is money. If you have that money, just walk into the bookshop.

0:16:04.360,0:16:07.540
They will not ask you whether you are a Christian or whatever.

0:16:07.540,0:16:12.380
They need money to give you a copy of the Bible.

0:16:12.380,0:16:21.620
When we know this, we will be able to train our children, ourselves and our friends.

0:16:21.620,0:16:24.520
Don't let anybody deceive you with their appearance

0:16:24.520,0:16:26.860
or when they say, "Good morning, sir!"

0:16:26.860,0:16:34.000
After that "good morning, sir", you can turn your back and they will be the ones to kill you.

0:16:34.000,0:16:43.540
Or somebody responsible for a death - while people are crying, he, the killer, will now come back.

0:16:43.540,0:16:47.180
He will rush there and start crying.

0:16:47.180,0:16:53.420
He would be the one to cry and jump around and people will say, "Don't die, it's alright!"

0:16:53.420,0:16:56.460
whereas he is the one that killed the deceased.

Is that not action?

0:17:02.040,0:17:09.160
He would cry genuinely, tears would come out - not that he pretends - you see tears coming out.

0:17:09.160,0:17:16.200
He would be the one joining them, shouting, crying, "He is my brother, my dear friend"

0:17:16.200,0:17:19.820
- and he would be cursing the person who killed the man:

0:17:19.820,0:17:25.120
"God will do this, God will do that!", and he is the one that...

0:17:25.120,0:17:27.120
What do we do about this?

In the service, you can call the name Jesus a million times -

0:17:33.460,0:17:41.380
just as a demonstration to show people that you are a believer, a true man of God.

0:17:41.380,0:17:42.700
So, please...

0:17:42.700,0:17:49.140
It is the force behind accomplishment.

0:17:49.140,0:17:52.660
The force behind what? - Accomplishment.
