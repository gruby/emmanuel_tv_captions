0:20:04.160,0:20:12.240
and see what we can do to restore these children, we may lose it all.

0:20:12.240,0:20:13.520

0:20:54.080,0:20:59.380
that if I don't restore this boy - because this is not the way God gave you,

0:20:59.380,0:21:04.980
God never gave you a drug addict, God never gave you a militant -

0:21:04.980,0:21:08.180
but you have to restore these children back -

0:21:08.180,0:21:12.140
