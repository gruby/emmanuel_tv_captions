God is still saying something.

During a live service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B Joshua gave a prophecy concerning Abuja-the capital of Nigeria

0:00:15.760,0:00:17.920
These were his words:

0:00:17.920,0:00:21.080
Listen to me, my people in Nigeria.

0:00:21.080,0:00:25.340
Once again,take note of this:

0:00:25.340,0:00:29.960
Our security should be vigilant.

0:00:29.960,0:00:36.000
I am seeing a very big strike-explosion.

0:00:36.000,0:00:43.080
They should take care of Abuja-capital

0:00:43.080,0:00:48.960
When I talk, you see me in a bad light, but I will keep talking.

0:00:48.960,0:00:51.400
I don't need to say the state, but I am saying it.

0:00:51.400,0:00:54.080
This is what I am seeing happen in Abuja,

0:00:54.080,0:00:55.800
they should pray!

0:00:55.800,0:00:58.600
What can they do to capture this?

0:00:58.600,0:01:04.600
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
