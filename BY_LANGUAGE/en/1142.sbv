0:00:00.020,0:00:05.820
There is a young couple - your wife is beats you all the time.

0:00:05.820,0:00:07.600
Come out.

My name is Ogbe Emmanuel.

0:00:17.100,0:00:22.300
I'm the one the man of God prophesied about that his wife always beats him.

0:00:22.300,0:00:28.540
Each time I and my wife have a little quarrel or I want to correct her,

0:00:28.540,0:00:30.220
she will not listen to me.

0:00:30.220,0:00:34.740
Just a little correction – she would beat me.

0:00:34.740,0:00:41.360
Two months ago, she beat me on the mouth and blood started gushing out.

0:00:41.360,0:00:44.600
She does not have affection for me.

0:00:44.600,0:00:50.800
Since I married her in 2015, I have never felt like a married man.

0:00:50.800,0:00:53.100
How does a married man feel?

0:00:53.100,0:00:57.640
They feel happy with their wives.

0:00:59.800,0:01:02.240
So, she used to beat you.

0:01:02.240,0:01:04.020
Yes, very well, man of God.

0:01:04.020,0:01:06.360
My name is Obiora Edith,

0:01:06.360,0:01:08.360
You used to beat your husband.

0:01:08.360,0:01:14.600
Yes, whenever I am angry, I slap him.

0:01:14.600,0:01:20.500
Most of the time, I get angry when I am close to him. I don’t know why.

0:01:20.500,0:01:23.620
Get close to him and see whether...

Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:01:36.840,0:01:41.620
We are Mr & Mrs Obiora Emmanuel.

0:01:41.620,0:01:50.740
We thank God for today, for the deliverance that God has given us last week, on Sunday.

0:01:50.740,0:01:56.400
Last Sunday, during the mass prayer, man of God prophesied

0:01:56.400,0:01:59.300
and pointed his hand towards the area where I was.

0:01:59.300,0:02:07.140
He said there was a young couple over there; the wife always beat the husband.

Prophecy Testimony

0:02:11.220,0:02:18.540
I just thought about it for one minute, because I knew what was happening at my home.

0:02:18.540,0:02:24.240
Immediately, I jumped up from my seat.

0:02:24.240,0:02:28.460
As I was going around, towards that side...

0:02:28.460,0:02:30.760
They asked me to go and bring my wife.

0:02:30.760,0:02:37.400
While going there, I saw my wife coming out.

0:02:37.400,0:02:41.080
You are so happy, you are laughing and smiling today.

0:02:41.080,0:02:44.980
Yeah, I'm happy because I know I'm free.

0:02:44.980,0:02:48.100
Mr & Mrs Obiora Emmanuel
Prophecy Testimony

0:02:48.100,0:02:50.880
You know; man of God said that we were young.

0:02:50.880,0:02:59.120
Yeah, as you can see, I'm young, and my wife is very young, as well.

0:02:59.120,0:03:06.120
We got married in 2015.

0:03:06.120,0:03:22.040
To be frank with you - you could see me trying to explain to man of God that I never tasted a happy home.

0:03:22.040,0:03:33.440
Before I married my wife; I was raised in a Christian home, I always tried to follow the rules of God.

0:03:33.440,0:03:39.820
I prepared myself for this marriage.

0:03:39.820,0:03:46.960
There were many women, girls around me but I separated myself from them for one year,

0:03:46.960,0:03:51.060
in order to look for a good partner.

0:03:51.060,0:03:58.280
After that I checked myself very well, and I remembered this fine, beautiful lady standing here.

0:03:58.280,0:04:03.040
I decided to approach her by making a phone call.

0:04:03.040,0:04:09.020
During the first phone call conversation, I asked her if she would become my wife.

0:04:09.020,0:04:15.220
I married my wife and the trouble started.

0:04:15.220,0:04:22.880
At that time, my wife was very young, she just finished her secondary school.

0:04:22.880,0:04:31.060
Immediately we came to our house, she was in social media, always with her phone, busy.

0:04:31.060,0:04:33.340
She had no time for me.

0:04:33.340,0:04:43.140
I talked with her about that, asking her, "Please, leave this phone for some time. Let us talk.

0:04:43.140,0:04:46.680
Let us reason as husband and wife."

0:04:46.680,0:04:51.660
As I begged her, she refused to listen.

0:04:51.660,0:04:56.560
I told her that this thing she was doing - I also knew how to do it very well;

0:04:56.560,0:05:00.860
when I start doing it, there would be a "fire".

0:05:00.860,0:05:02.900
She refused.

0:05:02.900,0:05:05.320
I gave her time to stop but she refused.

0:05:05.320,0:05:13.000
Then, I started using social media on my new phone.

0:05:13.000,0:05:20.340
I was sending "friend requests" to different ladies.

0:05:20.340,0:05:23.200
As I started doing it, the "fire" began.

0:05:23.200,0:05:26.520
We were not listening to each other anymore.

0:05:26.520,0:05:29.140
I said, "OK, let me forget that one".

0:05:29.140,0:05:33.240
This happened at the very beginning of our marriage.

0:05:33.240,0:05:38.040
This lasted last year, and especially this year.

0:05:38.040,0:05:44.420
That is when I stared developing another habit of drinking alcohol.

0:05:44.420,0:05:49.800
This was caused by too much of disrespect, beating me...

0:05:49.800,0:05:59.640
You understand - we couldn't have talked; when I spoke, she spoke 20 times more.

0:05:59.640,0:06:06.780
When I tried to calm her down as a husband, getting near to her, asking what was the problem,

0:06:06.780,0:06:10.200
I would get a "bam".

0:06:10.200,0:06:14.200
To the glory of God; I thank God for being in The Synagogue today,

0:06:14.200,0:06:17.340
because I've been yearning to come here.

0:06:17.340,0:06:21.500
I knew that the man of God is the only person that could solve this problem.

0:06:21.500,0:06:23.680
Thank God for what happened last Sunday.

0:06:23.680,0:06:28.540
After the prophecy of last Sunday, I'm very happy with my wife.

0:06:28.540,0:06:34.660
Yesterday, we were walking towards that side - she held my hand here.

0:06:34.660,0:06:40.820
Mr & Mrs Obiora Emmanuel
Prophecy Testimony

0:06:40.820,0:06:42.760
Now, if you look...

0:06:42.760,0:06:46.200
Can you demonstrate what you are saying?

0:06:46.200,0:06:47.540
Like this.

0:06:47.540,0:06:49.240
You mean it was strange?

0:06:49.240,0:06:51.100
It was strange.

0:06:51.100,0:06:58.920
And she didn't look ashamed, she just focused on me.

0:06:58.920,0:07:02.720
You can see now - if you look at where we are sitting;

0:07:02.720,0:07:08.640
if she feels tired, she would be resting like this.

0:07:08.640,0:07:10.240
I'm very happy.

0:07:10.240,0:07:12.480
So, you mean that she never used to do all this before?

0:07:12.480,0:07:14.980
None of these things - I didn't deserve it.

0:07:14.980,0:07:16.180
Instead, it was beating...

0:07:16.180,0:07:24.480
Yeah, if she did like this by mistake, when she realised this, she would be like, "No, he doesn't deserve it."

0:07:24.480,0:07:25.240
You understand...

0:07:25.240,0:07:28.760
But I thank God; today I deserve all this.

0:07:28.760,0:07:32.060
Amen!

0:07:32.060,0:07:34.820
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:07:34.820,0:07:38.340
We are Mr & Mrs Obiora Emmanuel

0:07:38.340,0:07:41.700
Last Sunday, man of God gave us a prophecy.

0:07:41.700,0:07:48.500
It was after the mass prayer, I was sitting down, placing my head on the chair in front of me.

0:07:48.500,0:07:54.840
When I heard there was a couple, that the wife always beats, I was like, "Who does that?".

0:07:54.840,0:07:58.020
I raised up my head to know who the person was.

0:07:58.020,0:08:03.600
Then, I looked beside me and found out that my husband was no longer in the same place.

0:08:03.600,0:08:07.400
I said, "Wow, so, it is me."

0:08:07.400,0:08:13.520
Then, I said to myself that I was not going out, unless the usher comes and carries me out.

0:08:13.520,0:08:16.080
I couldn't see myself standing here.

0:08:16.080,0:08:19.940
For what?

0:08:19.940,0:08:27.400
I don't know what made me to carry my bag - they were big and heavy.

0:08:27.400,0:08:31.380
Before I passed I had to say, "Excuse me."

0:08:31.380,0:08:34.220
The space was just enough for me to pass.

0:08:34.220,0:08:38.940
When I came to the stage, I realised where I was.

0:08:38.940,0:08:44.080
I became more angry, like "What is this man saying?"

0:08:44.080,0:08:47.400
I was so angry at my husband.

0:08:47.400,0:08:54.580
After the prayer last Sunday, I see my husband as my husband.

0:08:54.580,0:08:59.240
Unlike before; whenever I was close to him, I was always sweating - I didn't know why,

0:08:59.240,0:09:02.180
even in the "air conditioned" place, I was always sweating.

0:09:02.180,0:09:05.700
One day, I asked him, "Don't you think it is a mistake, getting married to you?"

0:09:05.700,0:09:09.360
As I was sweating - imagine that.

0:09:09.360,0:09:11.840
Then he said I was not normal.

0:09:11.840,0:09:20.640
Then I realised I wasn't normal because I had a spiritual husband, which I knew.

0:09:20.640,0:09:22.600
I kept praying.

0:09:22.600,0:09:26.960
I thank God that after everything I came here and I was delivered.

0:09:26.960,0:09:28.720
Praise to Lord Jesus!

0:09:28.720,0:09:30.420
How do you beat your husband?

0:09:30.420,0:09:34.960
Whenever I was angry, because everything he did was "negative".

0:09:34.960,0:09:37.220
I didn't see "positive" in him.

0:09:37.220,0:09:42.820
Only when he was not around, I would see good and be like, "This man is really a good man".

0:09:42.820,0:09:46.200
But whenever he comes back...

0:09:46.200,0:09:50.580
I would be seeing another person.

0:09:50.580,0:09:57.540
Whenever he was talking to me, I would be saying, "Why is he giving me this advice?"

0:09:57.540,0:10:04.220
Instead of listening to what he was saying, I would keep remembering all that we were going through,

0:10:04.220,0:10:06.360
and I would be just like, "Leave me alone".

0:10:06.360,0:10:09.200
I would maybe slap him - I didn't know where my hand would go.

0:10:09.200,0:10:12.240
Sometimes, I didn't even know I beat him; I would just ask, "Did I just hit you?"

0:10:12.240,0:10:13.680
He would say, "No, you didn't beat me".

0:10:13.680,0:10:15.400
I thank God for today.

0:10:15.400,0:10:17.860
Thank you man of God.
