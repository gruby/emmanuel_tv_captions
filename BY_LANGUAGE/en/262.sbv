0:00:01.820,0:00:04.000
Thank you.  Thank you, you may be seated.

0:00:04.000,0:00:06.500
Thank you Lord!

0:00:06.500,0:00:07.500
Emmanuel

0:00:07.500,0:00:11.780
God with us!

0:00:11.780,0:00:15.640
Hallelujah!

0:00:15.640,0:00:20.980
I know that you are blessed today.

0:00:20.980,0:00:24.220
Glory be to God Almighty!

0:00:24.220,0:00:30.220
This is the opportunity to ask the questions that people always ask me.

0:00:30.280,0:00:33.240
Anytime people meet me they will say

0:00:33.240,0:00:39.360
"How do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:00:39.360,0:00:48.860
Say to your neighbor, "how do I know what my calling if God is?"

0:00:48.860,0:00:50.020
That is the question.

0:00:50.020,0:00:55.700
But whatever you do through God the is your calling.

0:00:55.700,0:00:58.780
How can we do things through God?

0:00:58.780,0:01:03.040
When God speaks to us through his word, by His Spirit.

0:01:03.040,0:01:07.860
How do I know what my calling from God is?

0:01:07.860,0:01:10.000
Are you a carpenter?

0:01:10.000,0:01:16.280
Whatever he accepts you to do through Him, that is your calling.

0:01:16.280,0:01:22.460
People will say, what is my calling?  Why did this happen to me?

0:01:22.460,0:01:24.980
Why am I not prospering?

0:01:24.980,0:01:27.880
Whenever you are dong something through God,

0:01:27.880,0:01:37.220
God will continue to speak strength and courage through your trials, take notice of that.

0:01:37.220,0:01:41.280
If God permits your to carry this through Him

0:01:41.280,0:01:44.040
I am carrying it through Him.

0:01:44.060,0:01:49.060
He will continue to speak strength and courage through my trials.

0:01:49.060,0:01:50.680
My trial could be this.  It could be that.

0:01:50.680,0:01:51.300
Could be that.

0:01:51.300,0:01:53.440
Could be that.

0:01:53.440,0:01:55.300
Hallelujah!

0:01:55.300,0:01:57.940
The title is of this message is: "Call of God."

0:01:57.940,0:02:00.300
Say, "Call of God."

0:02:00.300,0:02:00.940
I can't hear you.

0:02:00.940,0:02:02.900
Congregation: Call of God

0:02:02.900,0:02:03.600
I can't hear you.

0:02:03.600,0:02:04.920
Congregation: Call of God.

0:02:04.920,0:02:10.720
Lets take a look at Psalm 119:105

0:02:10.720,0:02:13.560
Psalm 119:105

0:02:13.560,0:02:25.340
Read and follow me,                                                                "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

0:02:25.340,0:02:28.820
Wow!

0:02:28.820,0:02:30.320
Listen to that, it said...

0:02:30.320,0:02:37.140
Psalm 119:105                                                                        "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

0:02:37.140,0:02:40.380
So, that answered your question.  What is my calling?

0:02:40.380,0:02:43.020
Am I really a lawyer?

0:02:43.020,0:02:46.820
If I am called as a lawyer, why is this happening to me?

0:02:46.820,0:02:47.780
Title of Message: "Call of God."

0:02:47.780,0:02:50.160
Am, I really a medical doctor?

0:02:50.160,0:02:52.760
If I am really a medical doctor, if this is my calling;

0:02:52.760,0:02:55.480
why is this happening to me?

0:02:55.480,0:02:56.300
Title of Message: "Call of God."

0:02:56.300,0:02:58.320
This has answered your question.

0:02:58.320,0:03:05.920
If His word is a lamp to your feet and a light to your path,

0:03:05.920,0:03:12.280
It means the first step in knowing your calling

0:03:12.280,0:03:15.520
is to get to know God better

0:03:15.520,0:03:17.080
by reading his word.

0:03:17.140,0:03:26.660
As God communicates to you through his word, by His Spirit,

0:03:26.660,0:03:36.640
you will know what He wants you to do and where He wants you to go.

0:03:36.640,0:03:39.500
He cannot interact you with.  
He cannot act with you,

0:03:39.500,0:03:44.080
and you cannot hear from Him without His word.

0:03:44.080,0:03:46.700
Let's go to the book of Roman 12:2

0:03:46.700,0:03:53.520
Romans 12:2 It says, " Do not conform to this world, but be transformed

0:03:53.520,0:04:00.860
but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

0:04:00.860,0:04:04.360
Romans 12:2 that you may prove what is that good and

0:04:04.360,0:04:10.460
and acceptable and perfect will of God."

0:04:10.460,0:04:19.580
When you let God transform you by the power of the Holy Spirit,

0:04:19.580,0:04:25.420
He will literally begin to show you the way...

0:04:25.460,0:04:34.400
He will literally begin to show you the way.

0:04:34.400,0:04:37.440
Then you can know,

0:04:37.440,0:04:39.560
where He wants you to go.

0:04:39.620,0:04:41.180
How He wants you to do this.

0:04:41.180,0:04:45.220
How He wants you to do that.

0:04:45.220,0:04:49.100
Many of us we don't allow God to transform us.

0:04:49.100,0:04:59.660
Not only must you become a pastor by HIs word, but by His Spirit.

0:04:59.660,0:05:07.680
HIs Word refreshes our mind and HIs Spirit renews our strength

0:05:07.680,0:05:16.960
HIs Word refreshes our mind and HIs Spirit renews our strength

0:05:16.960,0:05:23.960
He is waiting for you at the point of His Spirit.

0:05:23.960,0:05:27.540
You can go anywhere to learn his word.

0:05:27.540,0:05:30.820
You can choose to go to school, you can go to anywhere with no more problem

0:05:30.820,0:05:35.960
you can learn it.  You can be very very thorough

0:05:35.960,0:05:40.060
But when it comes to His Spirit, He gives it.

0:05:40.060,0:05:46.700
You must be ready to be reformed.

0:05:46.700,0:05:50.760
You must abide by His principles.

0:05:50.760,0:05:52.060
You can learn his word.

0:05:52.060,0:05:54.220
Say "God is this.  God is that."

0:05:54.220,0:05:55.920
God is Savior.  God is this.

0:05:55.920,0:05:58.180
You can preach the word from Genesis to Revelation.

0:05:58.280,0:06:05.040
You have thorough knowledge of God, that does not make your His child.

0:06:05.040,0:06:07.340
Can you see where our problem is now?

0:06:07.340,0:06:12.240
That I standing here telling you that God is this. Jesus is this. Jesus is that.

0:06:12.240,0:06:18.400
It's just not enough to say that this is a man of God;

0:06:18.400,0:06:21.320
because anybody can stand here to preach it

0:06:21.320,0:06:22.520
whereas he's not

0:06:22.520,0:06:24.800
the one.

0:06:24.800,0:06:28.960
Not only must you have God's word in order to be born again,

0:06:28.960,0:06:31.340
you must have God's spirit.

0:06:31.340,0:06:32.280
Why?

0:06:32.280,0:06:41.620
Because God's word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.

0:06:41.620,0:06:48.940
Tell your neighbor, "God's word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit."

0:06:48.940,0:06:52.160
If God's word is not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:06:52.160,0:06:54.740
whatever you are saying, you are saying to yourself.

0:06:54.740,0:06:58.540
You are speaking of yourself and not of God.

0:06:58.580,0:07:03.640
God's word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit

0:07:03.660,0:07:16.360
to nurture us and furnish us  with everything that we need to succeed on earth.

0:07:16.360,0:07:18.160
Are you with me?

0:07:18.160,0:07:23.100
If God's word is not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:07:23.100,0:07:29.760
whatever you are saying, you are speaking to yourself.

0:07:29.760,0:07:33.040
"Be healed!" You are wasting your time.

0:07:33.060,0:07:35.960
"Be delivered!" You are wasting your time.

0:07:35.960,0:07:38.480
"Be saved!"  You are wasting your time.

0:07:38.480,0:07:43.360
You are prophesying that it will rain tomorrow.  It will not rain!

0:07:43.360,0:07:50.400
Read it (the bible), it is food for your soul.

0:07:50.400,0:07:56.480
Read it, it is a guide for your feet.

0:07:56.480,0:08:03.120
Read it!  It has a purifying power.

0:08:03.120,0:08:09.760
Read it!  It has a coverting power.

0:08:09.880,0:08:13.420
It is enduring.  Read it!

0:08:13.420,0:08:17.760
It rejoices the heart.  Read it!

0:08:17.760,0:08:19.180
Read it!

0:08:19.180,0:08:24.740
To keep you from sin and error.  Read it!

0:08:24.740,0:08:28.720
Read it!   It is so profitable.

0:08:28.720,0:08:30.720
Like I have said,

0:08:30.720,0:08:35.420
"It is the tool in the hands of the Holy Ghost.

0:08:35.420,0:08:39.880
If it's not in the hands of the Holy Ghost, what ever  you are saying,

0:08:39.880,0:08:44.880
you are talking of yourself.

0:08:44.880,0:08:48.080
That is why you see people saying "In the name of Jesus!  In the name of Jesus!"

0:08:48.080,0:08:49.640
Sometime you see people people praying and praying.

0:08:49.640,0:08:50.840
Shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking.

0:08:50.840,0:08:52.060
Praying, praying.Jumping, jumping

0:08:52.060,0:08:55.780
At the end of the day it result into a headache.

0:08:55.780,0:08:58.060
Nothing will come out of it.

0:08:58.060,0:09:02.220
Many are getting frustrated fasting and praying,

0:09:02.240,0:09:06.100
and they begin to date and time they became a christian.

0:09:06.100,0:09:09.460
Many will read bible and place it on their chest, when they want to sleep.

0:09:09.500,0:09:12.640
That is where satan will come to flock them.

0:09:12.640,0:09:16.320
Even sometime satan will carry  the bible from their chest and place it down

0:09:16.320,0:09:20.420
and begin to flock them, and say this bible, "where did you get it?"

0:09:20.420,0:09:23.800
There is a bible.  There is a holy bible.

0:09:23.800,0:09:30.220
Anybody can buy a Bible; not everyone has access to a Holy Bible.

0:09:30.220,0:09:40.160
The bible is for sale, but the Holy Bible is not.

0:09:40.200,0:09:44.920
You can find a Bible in the library, but the Holy Bible is not in the library.

0:09:44.920,0:09:51.500
It's in your heart.

0:09:51.500,0:09:55.640
Many authors of this Bible that you have today

0:09:55.640,0:09:58.000
they are not christians.  They are philosophers.

0:09:58.000,0:10:02.260
They wrote this bible for the sake of getting money out of it.

0:10:02.260,0:10:04.120
They are not christians, they don't believe what they have.

0:10:04.120,0:10:07.340
They are historical.

0:10:07.340,0:10:14.120
When you are carrying it, if it's not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:10:14.120,0:10:17.240
you are just carrying a book.

0:10:17.240,0:10:21.660
When you talk, if it's not in the mouth of the Holy Ghost,

0:10:21.660,0:10:24.220
you are talking to yourself.

0:10:24.220,0:10:29.020
When you preach it, if that is not from the Holy Ghost,

0:10:29.020,0:10:31.200
you are just telling them history.

0:10:31.200,0:10:37.440
History is all about events, if it's not from the Holy Ghost.

0:10:37.440,0:10:45.420
Talk scripture in every conversation.

0:10:45.420,0:10:50.680
If you want to make a call, say "hello,  hello?"  "Oh, hello sir!"

0:10:50.680,0:10:51.940
"You are blessed!"

0:10:51.940,0:10:53.820
"With God all things are possible!"

0:10:53.820,0:10:55.220
You say, "thank you sir!"

0:10:55.220,0:10:59.880
Yes, "where are you going this morning?"

0:10:59.880,0:11:03.620
Carry God along.  Talk scripture!

0:11:03.620,0:11:11.140
Your may be on the phone or in a business transaction, talk scripture.

0:11:11.140,0:11:14.920
Use the word of God to answer someone.

0:11:14.920,0:11:17.860
Tell your neighbor , "Use the word of God!"

0:11:17.860,0:11:20.900
Congregation: Use the word of God to answer someone.

0:11:20.900,0:11:28.400
The word of God becomes your data base for your personal opinion.

0:11:28.400,0:11:29.900
Title of Message: "Call of God."

0:11:29.900,0:11:36.760
But I want  tell you, the questions you always ask, I believe a few of them have been answered.

0:11:36.760,0:11:37.940
Title of Message: "Call of God."

0:11:37.940,0:11:42.980
That, "how do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:11:42.980,0:11:46.500
Congregation: "How do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:11:46.500,0:11:50.740
Again,"how do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:11:50.740,0:11:54.820
Congregation:  how do I know what my calling from God is?

0:11:54.820,0:11:56.100
Look!

0:11:56.100,0:12:02.380
When I know your weakness, I will be able to help you and also trust you.

0:12:02.380,0:12:05.860
We can get on with this continuing.

0:12:05.860,0:12:09.640
You are because I am;
I am because you are.

0:12:09.640,0:12:12.320
I know you love to hahahah (laugh)

0:12:12.320,0:12:17.380
The reason why I am and you are is to help you and for you to help me.

0:12:17.420,0:12:21.540
When I know that you laugh anyhow, I know that is my own assignment to help you.

0:12:21.540,0:12:26.820
That will not cause our conflict.  We will never fight because you laugh anyhow;

0:12:26.820,0:12:30.560
because I know your weakness, I will be thinking about how I can help you

0:12:30.560,0:12:32.700
get rid of that.

0:12:32.700,0:12:36.720
Look at what happened to Apostle Paul.

0:12:36.720,0:12:42.960
When your weakness is the midst of now drawing your close to God

0:12:42.960,0:12:50.520
to pray the more and fast more; it's no more a weakness.  It is a blessing.

0:12:50.520,0:12:54.520
That is the thing in which the Bible is talking about.

0:12:54.520,0:13:02.620
The problem we have today is that you believe there is time to pray, fast, and say amen!

0:13:02.620,0:13:09.500
That is why satan gets your just like that.

0:13:09.500,0:13:13.020
Your alter is in your heart.

0:13:13.020,0:13:19.220
When you say you will wait to get to a place before you pray, before you get there, satan will get you.

0:13:19.220,0:13:22.020
They know you have a place to pray.

0:13:22.020,0:13:24.080
Nooooo!

0:13:24.080,0:13:27.700
When you move, you need to pray in you heart.

0:13:27.700,0:13:31.240
You heart, it is  your alter.

0:13:31.240,0:13:39.480
Anytime there is an encounter either by thought or in your heart, you should immediately begin to blow him;

0:13:39.480,0:13:42.240
while you are standing, walking, and anywhere you are

0:13:42.240,0:13:45.620
begin to confess.  Begin to say "you have come again?"

0:13:45.620,0:13:48.960
You don't know I am a child of God?  I will deal with you!

0:13:48.960,0:13:54.440
I will finish you!  Begin to talk again!  Talk as if you are talking to a person.

0:13:54.440,0:13:58.100
See satan as a person.

0:13:58.100,0:14:01.920
The reason why satan wants you to talk his language

0:14:01.920,0:14:06.080
is to overthrow your position.

0:14:06.080,0:14:10.600
He wants you to overthrow your position.  The position you occupy before God.

0:14:10.600,0:14:12.160
He wants to overthrow it.

0:14:12.160,0:14:15.580
That is the reason that he wants you to talk his language.

0:14:15.580,0:14:18.700
To think like him.
