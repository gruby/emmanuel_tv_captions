How To Know Your Calling In Life - T.B. Joshua

0:00:01.680,0:00:04.000
Thank you. Thank you, you may be seated.

0:00:04.000,0:00:06.200
Thank you Lord!

0:00:06.200,0:00:07.560
Emmanuel

0:00:07.560,0:00:11.780
God with us!

0:00:11.780,0:00:15.360
Hallelujah!

0:00:15.360,0:00:20.980
I know that you are blessed today.

0:00:20.980,0:00:23.960
Glory be to God Almighty!

0:00:23.960,0:00:30.100
This is the opportunity to ask the question that people always ask me.

0:00:30.100,0:00:33.140
Anytime people meet me they will say,

0:00:33.140,0:00:39.360
"How do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:00:39.360,0:00:48.720
Say to your neighbour, "How do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:00:48.720,0:00:50.020
That is the question.

0:00:50.020,0:00:55.520
But whatever you do through God that is your calling.

0:00:55.520,0:00:58.560
How can we do things through God?

0:00:58.560,0:01:02.820
When God speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit,

0:01:02.820,0:01:07.440
how do I know what my calling from God is?

0:01:07.440,0:01:09.960
Are you a carpenter?

0:01:09.960,0:01:16.280
Whatever He accepts you to do through Him, that is your calling.

0:01:16.280,0:01:18.380
People will say, what is my calling?

0:01:18.380,0:01:22.460
Why did this happen to me?

0:01:22.460,0:01:24.760
Why am I not prospering?

0:01:24.760,0:01:27.760
Whenever you are doing something through God,

0:01:27.760,0:01:37.080
God will continue to speak strength and courage through your trials, take notice of that.

0:01:37.080,0:01:41.040
If God permits me to carry this through Him;

0:01:41.040,0:01:43.860
I am carrying it through Him.

0:01:43.860,0:01:48.800
He will continue to speak strength and courage through my trials.

0:01:48.800,0:01:53.180
My trial could be this or that.

0:01:53.180,0:01:55.220
Hallelujah!

0:01:55.220,0:01:57.680
The title is of this message is: "Call of God."

0:01:57.680,0:02:00.300
Say, "Call of God."

0:02:00.300,0:02:01.440
I can't hear you.

0:02:01.440,0:02:02.540
Call of God

0:02:02.540,0:02:03.600
I can't hear you.

0:02:03.600,0:02:05.100
Call of God.

0:02:05.100,0:02:13.180
Lets take a look at Psalm 119:105.

0:02:13.180,0:02:14.820
Read and follow me,

0:02:14.820,0:02:25.160
"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

0:02:25.160,0:02:28.460
Wow!

0:02:28.460,0:02:30.320
Listen to that, it said...

0:02:30.320,0:02:36.840
"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

0:02:36.840,0:02:40.680
So, that answered your question, "What is my calling?"

0:02:40.680,0:02:42.860
Am I really a lawyer?

0:02:42.860,0:02:47.340
If I am called as a lawyer, why is this happening to me?

0:02:47.340,0:02:50.160
Am, I really a medical doctor?

0:02:50.160,0:02:53.200
If I am really a medical doctor, if this is my calling;

0:02:53.200,0:02:56.480
why is this happening to me?

0:02:56.480,0:02:58.380
This is an answer to question.

0:02:58.380,0:03:05.760
If His word is a lamp to your feet and a light to your path,

0:03:05.760,0:03:12.080
It means the first step in knowing your calling

0:03:12.080,0:03:17.100
is to get to know God better by reading His Word.

0:03:17.100,0:03:26.480
As God communicates to you through His Word, by His Spirit,

0:03:26.480,0:03:36.400
you will know what He wants you to do and where He wants you to go.

0:03:36.400,0:03:39.260
He cannot interact you with, He cannot act with you,

0:03:39.280,0:03:43.860
and you cannot hear from Him without His Word.

0:03:43.860,0:03:46.640
Let's go to the book of Roman 12:2.

0:03:46.640,0:04:00.860
It says, " Do not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,

0:04:00.860,0:04:10.220
that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."

0:04:10.220,0:04:19.320
When you let God transform you by the power of the Holy Spirit,

0:04:19.320,0:04:34.400
He will literally begin to show you the way.

0:04:34.400,0:04:39.300
Then you can know, where He wants you to go,

0:04:39.300,0:04:45.060
how He wants you to do this, how He wants you to do that.

0:04:45.060,0:04:48.800
Many of us we don't allow God to transform us.

0:04:48.800,0:04:59.520
Not only must you become a pastor through His Word, but also by His Spirit.

0:04:59.520,0:05:16.800
His Word refreshes our mind and His Spirit renews our strength.

0:05:16.800,0:05:23.760
He is waiting for you at the point of His Spirit.

0:05:23.760,0:05:27.280
You can go anywhere to learn His Word.

0:05:27.280,0:05:31.540
You can choose to go to school, you can go to anywhere with no more problem - you can learn it.

0:05:31.540,0:05:35.960
You can be very very thorough,

0:05:35.960,0:05:39.800
but when it comes to His Spirit, He gives it.

0:05:39.800,0:05:46.560
You must be ready to be reformed.

0:05:46.560,0:05:50.440
You must abide by His principles.

0:05:50.440,0:05:55.680
You can learn His Word, say "God is this,  God is that, God is Saviour..."

0:05:55.680,0:05:58.180
You can preach the word from Genesis to Revelation,

0:05:58.180,0:06:04.820
you have thorough knowledge of God - that does not make your His child.

0:06:04.820,0:06:07.600
Can you see where our problem is now?

0:06:07.600,0:06:12.240
That I am standing here telling you that God is this, Jesus is this or that -

0:06:12.240,0:06:18.140
it's not enough for you to say that this is a man of God;

0:06:18.140,0:06:24.560
because anybody can stand here to preach it, whereas he's not the one.

0:06:24.560,0:06:28.700
Not only must you have God's Word in order to be born again,

0:06:28.700,0:06:31.080
you must have God's Spirit.

0:06:31.080,0:06:32.140
Why?

0:06:32.140,0:06:41.380
Because God's Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.

0:06:41.380,0:06:48.820
Tell your neighbour, "God's Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit."

0:06:48.820,0:06:51.900
If God's Word is not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:06:51.900,0:06:54.820
whatever you are saying, you are saying it to yourself,

0:06:54.820,0:06:58.480
You are speaking of yourself and not of God.

0:06:58.480,0:07:03.520
God's Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit

0:07:03.520,0:07:16.360
to nurture us and furnish us with everything that we need to succeed on earth.

0:07:16.360,0:07:18.060
Are you with me?

0:07:18.060,0:07:23.100
If God's Word is not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:07:23.100,0:07:29.560
whatever you are saying, you are speaking of yourself.

0:07:29.560,0:07:32.920
"Be healed!" - you are wasting your time.

0:07:32.920,0:07:35.760
"Be delivered!" - you are wasting your time.

0:07:35.760,0:07:38.340
"Be saved!" - you are wasting your time.

0:07:38.340,0:07:43.220
You are prophesying that it will rain tomorrow; it will not rain!

0:07:43.220,0:07:50.200
Read it, it is food for your soul.

0:07:50.200,0:07:56.480
Read it, it is a guide for your feet.

0:07:56.480,0:08:02.820
Read it!  It has a purifying power.

0:08:02.820,0:08:09.700
Read it!  It has a converting power.

0:08:09.700,0:08:13.180
It is enduring, read it!

0:08:13.180,0:08:19.000
It rejoices the heart, read it!

0:08:19.000,0:08:24.440
To keep you from sin and error, read it!

0:08:24.440,0:08:28.580
Read it, it is so profitable.

0:08:28.580,0:08:30.540
Like I have said;

0:08:30.540,0:08:35.420
it is the tool in the hands of the Holy Ghost.

0:08:35.420,0:08:39.880
If it's not in the hands of the Holy Ghost, whatever you are saying,

0:08:39.880,0:08:44.780
you are talking of yourself.

0:08:44.780,0:08:48.080
That is why you see people saying "In the name of Jesus!..."

0:08:48.080,0:08:49.640
Sometime you see people people praying and praying.

0:08:49.640,0:08:50.840
Shaking, shaking...

0:08:50.840,0:08:51.940
Praying, jumping...

0:08:51.940,0:08:55.380
At the end of the day it results into a headache.

0:08:55.380,0:08:57.900
Nothing comes out of it.

0:08:57.900,0:09:01.900
Many are getting frustrated fasting and praying,

0:09:01.900,0:09:05.200
and they begin to count for how long they have been a Christian.

0:09:05.200,0:09:09.280
Many will read Bible and place it on their chest, when they want to sleep.

0:09:09.280,0:09:12.460
That is when satan will come to flock them.

0:09:12.460,0:09:16.320
Even sometime satan will carry the Bible from their chest and put it down

0:09:16.320,0:09:20.260
and begin to flock them, and say, "This Bible - where did you get it?"

0:09:20.260,0:09:23.800
There is a Bible; there is the Holy Bible.

0:09:23.800,0:09:30.220
Anybody can buy a Bible; not everyone has access to the Holy Bible.

0:09:30.220,0:09:40.040
The Bible is for sale, but the Holy Bible is not.

0:09:40.040,0:09:44.920
You can find a Bible in the library, but the Holy Bible is not in the library.

0:09:44.920,0:09:51.400
It's in your heart.

0:09:51.400,0:09:58.000
Many authors of this Bible that you have today - they are not Christians, they are philosophers.

0:09:58.000,0:10:02.020
They wrote this bible for the sake of getting money out of it.

0:10:02.020,0:10:07.120
They are not Christians, they don't believe what they have - they are historians.

0:10:07.120,0:10:13.960
When you are carrying it, if it's not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

0:10:13.960,0:10:17.060
you are carrying a book.

0:10:17.060,0:10:21.480
When you talk, if it's not in the mouth of the Holy Ghost,

0:10:21.480,0:10:24.000
you are talking to yourself.

0:10:24.000,0:10:29.020
When you preach it, if that is not from the Holy Ghost,

0:10:29.020,0:10:31.020
you are just telling them history.

0:10:31.020,0:10:37.220
History is all about events, if it's not from the Holy Ghost.

0:10:37.220,0:10:45.420
Talk scripture in every conversation.

0:10:45.420,0:10:47.060
You want to make a call, you say,

0:10:47.060,0:10:50.480
"- Hello,  hello?"
-Oh hello, sir!

0:10:50.500,0:10:53.500
- You are blessed!
- With God all things are possible!

0:10:53.500,0:10:59.660
- Thank you sir! 
- Yes, where are you going this morning?

0:10:59.660,0:11:01.360
- Carry God along."

0:11:01.360,0:11:03.540
Talk Scripture!

0:11:03.540,0:11:10.920
Your may be on the phone or in a business transaction; talk Scripture.

0:11:10.920,0:11:14.820
Use the Word of God to answer someone.

0:11:14.820,0:11:20.620
Tell your neighbour, "Use the Word of God to answer someone."

0:11:20.620,0:11:29.920
The Word of God becomes your data base for your personal opinion.

0:11:29.920,0:11:38.660
I want tell you, the questions you always ask; I believe a few of them have been answered.

0:11:38.660,0:11:54.880
"How do I know what my calling from God is?"

0:11:54.880,0:11:55.900
Look!

0:11:55.900,0:12:02.380
When I know your weakness, I will be able to help you and also trust you.

0:12:02.380,0:12:05.660
We can get on with this, continuing.

0:12:05.660,0:12:09.500
You are because I am;
I am because you are.

0:12:09.500,0:12:12.220
I know you laugh...

0:12:12.220,0:12:17.140
The reason why I am and you are is to help you and for you to help me.

0:12:17.140,0:12:21.780
When I know that you laugh anyhow, I know that is my own assignment to help you.

0:12:21.780,0:12:24.220
That will not cause our conflict.

0:12:24.220,0:12:26.660
We will never fight because you laugh anyhow;

0:12:26.660,0:12:32.520
because I know your weakness, I will be thinking about how I can help you to get rid of that.

0:12:32.520,0:12:36.600
Look at what happened to Apostle Paul.

0:12:36.600,0:12:42.640
When your weakness is the means of drawing your close to God,

0:12:42.640,0:12:50.380
to pray the more and fast more; it's no more a weakness; i t is a blessing.

0:12:50.380,0:12:54.360
That is the foolish thing the Bible is talking about.

0:12:54.360,0:13:02.480
The problem we have today - you believe there is time to pray, fast, and say amen!

0:13:02.480,0:13:09.460
That is why satan gets your just like that, cheaply.

0:13:09.460,0:13:12.900
Your altar is in your heart.

0:13:12.900,0:13:19.220
Going to a place before you pray; before you get there, satan will get you.

0:13:19.220,0:13:22.020
They know you have a place to pray.

0:13:22.020,0:13:23.980
No!

0:13:23.980,0:13:31.180
When you move, you need to pray in you heart - it is  your altar.

0:13:31.180,0:13:39.260
Anytime there is an encounter, a thought or in your heart, you should immediately begin to blow him;

0:13:39.260,0:13:43.080
while you are standing, walking, and anywhere you are begin to confess,

0:13:43.080,0:13:50.680
begin to say "You have come again? You don't know I am a child of God? I will deal with you! I will finish you!"

0:13:50.680,0:13:54.440
Begin to talk again, talk as if you are talking to a person.

0:13:54.440,0:13:57.980
See satan as a person.

0:13:57.980,0:14:01.780
The reason why satan wants you to talk his language

0:14:01.780,0:14:06.080
is to overthrow your position.

0:14:06.080,0:14:10.680
He wants to overthrow the position you occupy before God.

0:14:10.680,0:14:12.160
He wants to overthrow it.

0:14:12.160,0:14:18.520
That is the reason why he wants you to talk his language, to think like him.

0:14:18.520,0:14:27.560
Once that thought is drawing you more and more into the midst of God, it is no longer satan's thought.

0:14:27.560,0:14:31.360
He is a mean to strengthen your desire.

0:14:31.360,0:14:36.860
If you are where God wants you to be, even though you walk through

0:14:36.860,0:14:41.840
the valley of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil

0:14:41.840,0:14:45.820
because you are where God wants you to be.

0:14:45.820,0:14:53.000
It is when we are not where God wants us to be, fear comes,

0:14:53.000,0:14:54.100
trouble comes.

0:14:54.100,0:14:59.560
But if you are where God want you to be,

0:14:59.560,0:15:06.900
the Lord will continue to speak strength and courage through your trials.

0:15:06.900,0:15:12.940
We believe that you have been inspired by the clip that you have just watched.
