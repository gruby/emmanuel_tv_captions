PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA VISITS THE CITY OF JERUSALEM

0:00:10.460,0:00:14.180
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel

0:00:14.180,0:00:20.060
In the heart of the ancient city of Jerusalem is situated the new headquarters of ZAKA,

0:00:20.060,0:00:26.200
the renowned and UN-recognized disaster victim identification organization in Israel.

0:00:26.200,0:00:33.080
Joined by Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, chairman and co-founder of ZAKA, Prophet T.B. Joshua visited the site

0:00:33.080,0:00:37.060
of the new ZAKA headquarters to review the design of the building.

0:00:37.060,0:00:43.140
We want to bring the design so you can see it here.

0:00:43.140,0:00:47.740
So, there will be an entrance from the road.

0:00:47.740,0:00:52.420
Here we have “Israel Care” as Prophet asked.

0:00:52.420,0:00:57.300
We also believe in it and spoke to our volunteers who think it is a very good idea

0:00:57.300,0:01:04.700
because at the end of the day, we are here to give care to everybody.

0:01:04.700,0:01:07.320
Once we go in, we have our different offices.

0:01:07.320,0:01:11.160
We have our international dispatch center.

0:01:11.160,0:01:13.000
We have our conference room.

0:01:13.000,0:01:21.980
Downstairs, we have all the equipment we need if there is a war or something big around the world.

0:01:21.980,0:01:27.440
All the different units we have in ZAKA, each of them will have a room in this building.

0:01:27.440,0:01:33.300
In here, we can continue the love the Prophet always speaks about, all around the world.

0:01:33.300,0:01:41.940
The Rabbi says the most important thing is that the Prophet’s office in Jerusalem is here.

0:01:41.940,0:01:43.560
This is your home.

0:01:43.560,0:01:52.660
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel

0:01:52.660,0:01:59.580
Where is this tree here?

Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel

0:02:06.260,0:02:12.220
One of the main things ZAKA is trying to do around the world is also avoiding bad things.

0:02:12.220,0:02:15.960
We will have classes here to show people the harm that happens everywhere

0:02:15.960,0:02:18.520
and how we can change and be better people.

0:02:18.520,0:02:21.940
Once we are better people, we work from our heart.

0:02:21.940,0:02:23.640
We love each other and we help other people.

0:02:23.640,0:02:25.820
Rabbi wants to say something.

0:02:25.820,0:02:38.940
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel

0:02:38.940,0:02:44.620
Rabbi says the way you see the layout outside is the real layout.

0:02:44.620,0:02:51.200
What is important here is that there is a lot of light in this building.

0:02:51.200,0:02:59.920
We believe that we can "open the light" to other people, to everybody.

0:02:59.920,0:03:01.340
It is wonderful.

0:03:01.340,0:03:04.180
We want you to keep it, Prophet.

0:03:04.180,0:03:05.380
Thank you very much.

0:03:05.380,0:03:07.920
This is your office in Jerusalem.

0:03:07.920,0:03:08.720
No problem.

0:03:08.720,0:03:13.520
Everything big starts little.

0:03:13.520,0:03:21.180
Look at this place; it starts little but it becomes big tomorrow.

0:03:21.180,0:03:24.880
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel

0:03:24.880,0:03:30.520
Rabbi says this is the beginning but we are with you all the way.

0:03:30.520,0:03:37.140
Under the name "Israel Care", the new ZAKA headquarters is designed to include a permanent office

0:03:37.140,0:03:42.700
for the man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:03:42.700,0:03:47.480

Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem

0:04:26.140,0:04:28.460
Welcome!

0:04:28.460,0:04:32.600
I’m Rabbi David Rosen; a great pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.

0:04:32.600,0:04:33.640
This is Mr Oded Wiener.

0:04:33.640,0:04:36.940
We have already met.

0:04:36.940,0:04:40.960
Shalom. Trond Bakkevig from Norway.

0:04:40.960,0:04:44.320
Hello; I’m Bishop Munib Younan.

0:04:44.320,0:04:47.540
Hajj Salah Zuheka.

0:04:47.540,0:04:51.740
Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem

0:04:51.740,0:05:00.600
I am Trond Bakkevig; I am the Convener of the Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land.

0:05:00.600,0:05:08.720
We created the Council of Religious Institutions in order to have a continuous entity

0:05:08.720,0:05:13.980
where we could meet constantly from all three religions and you are here.

0:05:13.980,0:05:19.720
The Council was created in order to have open lines of communication between religious leaders

0:05:19.720,0:05:24.600
so that through good times and bad times and in crisis situations,

0:05:24.600,0:05:29.180
there is a possibility of communication to solve problems,

0:05:29.180,0:05:31.500
which we have sometimes managed to do.

0:05:31.500,0:05:36.000
It is all about love; God is love.

0:05:36.000,0:05:41.980
Like the Book of 1 Corinthians 13:13 says, the greatest is love.

0:05:41.980,0:05:46.620
Also in the Hebrew Bible, the love of God appears many more times than the fear of God.

0:05:46.620,0:05:48.140
Thank you.

0:05:48.140,0:05:50.420
Let us love one another.

0:05:50.420,0:05:56.480
God is love.
We must love one another.

0:05:56.480,0:06:02.120
If we preach in love and faith, God preaches.

0:06:02.120,0:06:05.920
If we teach in love and faith, God teaches.

0:06:05.920,0:06:13.640
Love looks around to see who is in need, who is crying, who is unsafe.

0:06:13.640,0:06:15.420
That is love.

0:06:15.420,0:06:22.120
Failing to walk in love almost shuts down our spiritual walk with the Lord.

0:06:22.120,0:06:31.520
When I met Rabbi, I realised what he is doing in Jerusalem, Israel and all over the world

0:06:31.520,0:06:34.520
transcends the issue of religion.

0:06:34.520,0:06:38.980
I said we have to come together and see what we could do.

0:06:38.980,0:06:41.480
We cannot just look to the other side.

0:06:41.480,0:06:45.840
Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem

0:06:45.840,0:06:51.000
In his meeting with religious leaders from the Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land,

0:06:51.000,0:06:58.140
Prophet T.B. Joshua emphasizes on the importance of love, as the language that transcends all barriers

0:06:58.140,0:07:06.100
of race, religion, nationality and culture.

0:07:06.100,0:07:07.940
Love is the greatest.

0:07:07.940,0:07:13.600
If love is the greatest, there is nothing we can do without love.

0:07:13.600,0:07:17.600
All our efforts and attributes without love are nothing.

0:07:17.600,0:07:19.780
Thank you for coming.

0:07:19.780,0:07:22.740
Prophet T.B. Joshua Meets With Religious Leaders in Jerusalem

0:07:22.740,0:07:30.100
As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "The world needs to see our unity and our love for one another".

0:07:30.100,0:07:37.060
In a gesture of unity, the religious leaders of the Holy Land exchange hand shakes with the Prophet

0:07:37.060,0:07:40.160
and express their desire to work together.

0:07:40.160,0:07:41.840
My name is Rabbi David Rosen.

0:07:41.840,0:07:45.760
As I mentioned earlier, once upon a time, I was Rabbi of Seapoint in Cape Town, South Africa.

0:07:45.760,0:07:47.800
I was then Chief Rabbi of Ireland.

0:07:47.800,0:07:49.960
I have been back in Israel since 1985.

0:07:49.960,0:07:53.520
I am the Advisor of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel on International Relations.

0:07:53.520,0:07:58.460
I am part of the Steering Committee of The Council Of Religious Institutions Of The Holy Land.

0:07:58.460,0:08:00.100
I am Oded Wiener.

0:08:00.100,0:08:05.460
I used to be the Director General of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel for 14 years.

0:08:05.460,0:08:12.500
Before that, for 12 years, I was in charge of all the Jewish Holy Sites in Israel.

0:08:12.500,0:08:19.660
Now, I am Advisor to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel on all Interfaith Dialogue around the world.

0:08:19.660,0:08:24.580
It is very interesting to hear about his work for the poor and needy around the world.

0:08:24.580,0:08:30.600
It’s not just in Nigeria but countries like Colombia, Haiti

0:08:30.600,0:08:34.940
and other countries where we heard about his noble work.

0:08:34.940,0:08:42.540
It is very interesting to know the person and hear about his unbelievable work.

0:08:42.540,0:08:47.400
It is an honour for us to meet such a great person.

0:08:47.400,0:08:51.440
Our job here is to promote peace and work together.

0:08:51.440,0:08:54.860
We would be honoured and glad to work together.

0:08:54.860,0:09:00.400
I am Trond Bakkevig; I am a priest of the Church of Norway, Lutheran Church.

0:09:00.400,0:09:07.900
I am here in Jerusalem because I am the Convener of The Council Of Religious Institutions Of The Holy Land.

0:09:07.900,0:09:13.340
The purpose of the Council is to bring the religious leaders of Jerusalem and the Holy Land together

0:09:13.340,0:09:17.780
which are the three religions – the Jewish, the Christians and the Muslims,

0:09:17.780,0:09:24.340
in order to make them an instrument for peace in this land.

0:09:24.340,0:09:26.920
It is nice to meet him and good to hear what he is doing.

0:09:26.920,0:09:32.580
It is impressive to hear what he is doing for relief work around the world.

0:09:32.580,0:09:35.500
I hope we can continue our contacts.

T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Jerusalem Municipality To Meet With The Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem

0:10:36.040,0:10:38.920
I hear you are a friend of Israel, a friend of ZAKA.

0:10:38.920,0:10:45.040
It’s very important for us and for all the people around the world.

0:10:45.040,0:10:58.600

0:11:13.480,0:11:15.940
with the deputy mayor of Jerusalem.

0:11:15.940,0:11:19.020
Shalom.

0:11:19.020,0:11:25.720
He is in charge of building and building and building more.

0:11:25.720,0:11:28.960
I am in charge of young adult families...

0:11:28.960,0:11:33.200
He makes sure the people get the "right culture", growing up in the right way.

0:11:33.200,0:11:36.420
The magic of Jerusalem is the fact that it’s diverse.

0:11:36.420,0:11:42.020
It’s not just a city of one colour; it has many colours and we can cooperate together.

0:11:42.020,0:11:47.600
Jews and non-Jews, we live all together.

0:11:47.600,0:11:52.020
He says that his office is in a beautiful place.

0:11:52.020,0:11:54.380
We are going to go out and see all the beautiful nature.

0:11:54.380,0:11:57.740
When they come back to their offices, their heads will work better.

0:11:57.740,0:12:03.240

This is the old city of Jerusalem and as Yosef said, it is a combination.

0:13:56.980,0:14:02.340
This is an Arab part of the city; Christians and Arabs are over there.

0:14:02.340,0:14:07.940
Jewish people and these are orthodox over there.

0:14:07.940,0:14:10.380
Beautiful, isn't it?

0:14:10.380,0:14:16.860

0:14:37.720,0:14:49.940
The strong one, being able to stand for many years; 4,000 years.

0:14:49.940,0:14:56.340
It’s a symbol of the Kingdom of the Jewish people, Judah.

0:14:56.340,0:14:59.380

Prophet, I have something here; I think this is an appropriate place to do this.

0:15:22.680,0:15:27.680
Prophet T.B. Joshua decided to become one of ZAKA’s leaders,

0:15:27.680,0:15:37.360
helping people no matter what religion they are – Jews, non-Jews, from Israel and all over the world.

0:15:37.360,0:15:41.880
The Chairman, Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, wants to give you a token of appreciation.

0:15:41.880,0:15:48.340
We give it only to special people who know that our role is to give to one another.

0:15:48.340,0:15:56.700
Rabbi would like to give this to you together with the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem,

0:15:56.700,0:16:00.320
showing our appreciation for all that you have done and are going to do

0:16:00.320,0:16:03.720
towards helping other people all over the world.

0:16:03.720,0:16:07.460
You deserve much more but this is a small symbol from us.

In our Scriptures, it says, if you save one soul, it’s like you save the whole world.

0:16:18.720,0:16:20.960
It looks like you have saved a lot of souls.

0:16:20.960,0:16:26.660
This is the voice of Jesus. If you save one soul, you save the whole world.

0:16:26.660,0:16:28.940
Thank you.

So, continue helping Jerusalem and you will have a lot of success.

T.B. Joshua Meets Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem Yosef Daitsh And City Councilman Hanan Rubin

0:17:42.680,0:17:47.820
After the presentation of the award in the deputy mayor's office, they escort Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:17:47.820,0:17:51.580
into the Jerusalem municipality hall.

0:17:51.580,0:17:58.080
The Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem Yosef Daitsh Leads T.B. Joshua Into Jerusalem Municipality Hall

0:17:58.080,0:18:02.200
There are 21 members of the city council.

0:18:02.200,0:18:12.240
Up there you will see symbols of the 12 tribes of Israel.

0:18:12.240,0:18:20.580
It is said in the Bible that Jerusalem was the only place that was for everyone.

0:18:20.580,0:18:29.240
It represents unity, where people like Yosef, me and others can sit together in Jerusalem.

0:18:29.240,0:18:37.620
The Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem Yosef Daitsh Leads T.B. Joshua Into Jerusalem Municipality Hall

0:18:37.620,0:18:42.640
Explaining the importance of the Jerusalem municipality hall as a place of unity,

0:18:42.640,0:18:48.820
they show the Prophet around and ask the Prophet to bless the gathering.

0:18:48.820,0:18:53.080
Rabbi asks if you could give them a blessing for all the work they do.

0:18:53.080,0:18:57.820
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA VISITS THE CITY OF HEBRON

0:19:25.520,0:19:27.840
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Holy Land And Journeys To Hebron

0:19:27.840,0:19:35.740
During his visit to the Holy Land, Prophet T.B. Joshua travels south of Jerusalem to the cave of the patriarchs,

0:19:35.740,0:19:42.140
the tomb of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in Hebron, ancient Judea.

0:19:42.140,0:19:50.940
As recorded in Genesis 23, "Afterward, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah

0:19:50.940,0:19:56.520
near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan".

0:19:56.520,0:20:00.400
This is the visit of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:00.400,0:20:02.820
Welcome.

0:20:02.820,0:20:05.700
Abraham buried his wife Sarah here.

0:20:05.700,0:20:07.920
Why did Abraham bury his wife Sarah here?

0:20:07.920,0:20:11.260
He bought this from Ephron.

0:20:11.260,0:20:13.060
Why did he buy this place?

0:20:13.060,0:20:17.400
Because he knew that Adam and Eve were buried over here as well.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:20:19.980,0:20:28.060
As recorded in Genesis 25, "Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age,

0:20:28.060,0:20:32.380
an old man and full of years".

0:20:32.380,0:20:38.340
His sons, Isaac and Ishmael, buried him in the Cave of Machpelah near Mamre.

0:20:38.340,0:20:42.960
There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.

0:20:42.960,0:20:52.740
Above this big structure, there is a church from the time of the Crusaders which was built on top of this structure.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:21:02.600,0:21:06.900
The Jews used to come to the Seventh Step, which is over here.

0:21:06.900,0:21:13.860
Today, thank God, since we liberated in 1967, we can enter the cave.

0:21:13.860,0:21:16.820
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:21:16.820,0:21:24.460
When we speak about the actual graves, you have to understand they are three stories down.

0:21:24.460,0:21:33.320
Herod built this structure; then the Turks, the Ottomans came and built this structure.

0:21:33.320,0:21:39.720
And because it is a holy place, they built two mosques on top.

0:21:39.720,0:21:51.280
And still today, we have a church on the roof which was built in the time of the Crusaders.

0:21:51.280,0:21:52.720
Come, please.

0:21:52.720,0:21:59.060
The history of this Biblical site is recalled, as Prophet T.B. Joshua arrives at the entrance

0:21:59.060,0:22:01.940
to the Cave of the Patriarchs.

0:22:01.940,0:22:07.280
Let us follow his journey, as he visits the tombs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,

0:22:07.280,0:22:13.900
who requested in Genesis 49, "Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron".

0:22:13.900,0:22:17.460
"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife,

0:22:17.460,0:22:20.620
there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife,

0:22:20.620,0:22:22.800
and there I buried Leah." (Genesis 49:31)

0:22:22.800,0:22:25.680
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:22:25.680,0:22:33.140
As Prophet T.B. Joshua makes his way up the steps, not just to see the resting place of the heroes of faith

0:22:33.140,0:22:36.100
but to honour the God they served.

0:22:36.100,0:22:43.260
We cannot help but remember the voice of Jesus in Matthew 22, "Have you not read what God said to you,

0:22:43.260,0:22:48.940
‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?"

0:22:48.940,0:22:52.760
He is not the God of the dead but of the living.

0:22:52.760,0:22:55.700
Tomb of Abraham.

0:22:55.700,0:22:58.180
Tomb of Sarah.

0:22:58.180,0:23:05.800
At this precious site of the burial place of father Abraham and his wife Sarah, some of the heroes of faith,

0:23:05.800,0:23:09.100
Prophet T.B. Joshua prays.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:23:12.680,0:23:16.000
His heart deeply engaged with God,

0:23:16.000,0:23:20.460
Prophet T.B. Joshua spends a moment at the tomb of Abraham,

0:23:20.460,0:23:24.180
adorned with references to the Holy Scriptures.

0:23:53.900,0:24:02.580
The Cave of the Patriarchs – four patriarchs and matriarchs were buried here 4,000 years ago.

0:24:02.580,0:24:08.240
You are touching the Bible here, the Old Testament.

0:24:08.240,0:24:10.140
Please, come.

0:24:10.140,0:24:26.980
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:24:26.980,0:24:33.780
Continuing around the outside of the structure, Prophet T.B. Joshua makes his way to the wall that is believed

0:24:33.780,0:24:42.040
to surround the exact location of the resting place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah

0:24:42.040,0:24:46.500
- a sacred site, which has become a place of prayer.

0:24:46.500,0:24:53.040
Standing with Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, Prophet T.B. Joshua offers a prayer to the God of Abraham,

0:24:53.040,0:24:55.740
Isaac and Jacob, in Jesus' name.

0:24:55.740,0:24:59.440
He then continues through the spiritual monument.

0:24:59.440,0:25:11.420
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:25:11.420,0:25:19.560
We are standing here; this rock where we stood is what is called the Seventh Step.

0:25:19.560,0:25:33.800
Because so many people, generations, over hundreds of years stood in this place,

0:25:33.800,0:25:42.840
like the Wailing Wall and prayed and cried and asked God for whatever,

0:25:42.840,0:25:48.540
today we believe that if someone comes and also sits here and has a problem in life,

0:25:48.540,0:25:54.840
and wants to ask God for something, anything -

0:25:54.840,0:25:59.600
for a medical problem, financial problem or fertility problem,

0:25:59.600,0:26:07.640
people come here to pray and God hears and accepts their prayers.

0:26:07.640,0:26:12.820
The tradition is that this is the entrance to Paradise.

0:26:12.820,0:26:37.960
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:26:37.960,0:26:38.800
Hi.

0:26:38.800,0:26:40.000
How are you?

0:26:40.000,0:26:41.200
I'm great.

0:26:41.200,0:26:43.060
It is nice to see you here.

0:26:43.060,0:26:45.160
Thank you.

0:26:45.160,0:26:48.780
Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron

0:26:48.780,0:27:02.800
Prophet, we are standing here near an olive tree orchard.

0:27:02.800,0:27:14.300
Somewhere over here was King David’s palace.

0:27:14.300,0:27:17.940
King David became king in Hebron.

0:27:17.940,0:27:29.760
He was king for 40 years – 7 years in Hebron and another 33 years in Jerusalem.

0:27:29.760,0:27:36.820
As 2 Samuel accounts, David asked, 'Where shall I go?' 'To Hebron', the Lord answered.

0:27:36.820,0:27:44.220
Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah".

0:27:44.220,0:27:50.820
Welcome to one of the most ancient places in Israel, maybe in the world.

0:27:50.820,0:27:52.280
Please come.

0:27:52.280,0:27:58.900
Prophet T.B. Joshua continues past David's Hebron palace and the tombs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob

0:27:58.900,0:28:06.920
to a hilltop near the Cave of Machpelach and enters a small ancient edifice, the tombs of Jesse,

0:28:06.920,0:28:12.080
father of King David, and Ruth, the great-grandmother of King David.

0:28:12.080,0:28:26.760
This is believed to be the tomb of Jesse, father of King David, and Ruth, the great-grandmother.

0:28:26.760,0:28:29.200
Hi.

0:28:29.200,0:28:31.540
How are you?
Thank you.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Inside The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth In Hebron

0:28:49.600,0:28:51.060
This is a ram's horn.

0:28:51.060,0:29:02.180
We believe, on our special day once a year, that when we blow this, anyone who hears the sound should think

0:29:02.180,0:29:08.140
about all the bad they did around the year and make sure that next year, they're not going to do it again.

Prophet T.B. Joshua On A Hilltop In Hebron - The Site Of The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth

0:29:20.200,0:29:26.840
Continuing through the complex, Prophet T.B. Joshua arrives at yet another ancient structure.

0:29:26.840,0:29:36.180
Prophet, there are hundreds of structures like this in Hebron.

0:29:36.180,0:29:38.860
I want to show you something.

0:29:38.860,0:29:50.260
This is an old structure, probably dated about 1,000 years ago.

0:29:50.260,0:29:52.280
Prophet T.B. Joshua In Hebron Near The Site Of The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth

0:29:52.280,0:29:59.000
Making their way out of the small entrance at the back of the structure, barely large enough to pass through,

0:29:59.000,0:30:04.640
they find themselves in an open grassy field in front of another edifice.

0:30:04.640,0:30:09.180
Passing through a tiny opening reveals an ancient room,

0:30:09.180,0:30:13.480
where Prophet T.B. Joshua immediately kneels down to pray.

0:30:13.480,0:30:30.900
Prophet T.B. Joshua Prays In An Ancient Synagogue In Hebron

0:30:30.900,0:30:35.080
Prayer is the shortest route between your heart and God.

0:30:35.080,0:30:39.580
God Almighty delights in hearing the prayers of His righteous children.

0:30:39.580,0:30:45.920
We pray not to pull God to our mind but to bring ourselves to His.

Prophet T.B. Joshua At The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth Near The Cave Of The Patriarchs In Hebron

0:31:51.200,0:31:58.200
Leaving the tombs of Jesse and Ruth, Prophet T.B. Joshua returns to the area believed to be the location

0:31:58.200,0:32:00.700
of the Hebron palace of King David.

0:32:00.700,0:32:06.940
As he surveys the grassy field, one can only imagine the view of the area in the time of David, a man whose

0:32:06.940,0:32:10.680
a man whose devotion and commitment to God and His Word

0:32:10.680,0:32:15.400
earned him divine recognition as a man after God's own heart,

0:32:15.400,0:32:23.880
a man who prayed in Psalm 130, "I wait for the Lord, my soul waits and in His Word I do hope.

0:32:23.880,0:32:28.060
My soul waits for the Lord, more than those who watch for the morning".

0:32:28.060,0:32:35.280
Somewhere over here, we believe was the castle of King David.

0:32:35.280,0:32:48.460
What I can tell you for sure is that King David, as a young shepherd, used to walk around here.

0:32:48.460,0:32:50.060
That was 4,000 years ago.

We are looking East.

Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron

0:34:20.420,0:34:30.220
In the Southeast was the Biblical city of Sodom.

0:34:30.220,0:34:36.940
Lot, the brother of Abraham, came from Sodom.

0:34:36.940,0:34:44.440
Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron

0:34:44.440,0:34:53.120
God said He was going to annihilate Sodom because of the bad things happening there.

0:34:53.120,0:35:01.220
Abraham speaks to God and says that maybe there are 100 righteous in Sodom.

0:35:01.220,0:35:10.860
God says no and Abraham asks if maybe there are 50 righteous in Sodom.

0:35:10.860,0:35:17.380
50, 40, 30, 10 - not 1.

0:35:17.380,0:35:22.120
And then God annihilates Sodom.

0:35:22.120,0:35:24.800
Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron

0:35:24.800,0:35:27.820
During the day, if we were here, we could look into Jordan.

0:35:27.820,0:35:33.460
We would see the Dead Sea; we are looking East.

0:35:33.460,0:35:45.860
What happens after Abraham, our father, speaks to God?

0:35:45.860,0:35:54.440
He says the first prayer to God in the world.

0:35:54.440,0:35:56.840
It is believed to be over here.

0:35:56.840,0:36:08.960
We are standing in the place where the first prayer to God was prayed to God.

0:36:08.960,0:36:15.520
Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron

0:36:15.520,0:36:18.600
Let's go to the structure over here.

0:36:18.600,0:36:43.120
Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron

0:36:43.120,0:36:50.580
Entering a small structure on the hill, a Bible is opened and they begin to read.

0:36:50.580,0:37:01.520
“And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre” (Genesis 18:1).

0:37:01.520,0:37:07.060
Mamre is 1 kilometre South of here.

0:37:07.060,0:37:11.000
Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron

0:37:11.000,0:37:15.000
“As he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day” (Genesis 18:1).

0:37:15.000,0:37:21.380
Abraham was sitting in the heat of the day and three angels came

0:37:21.380,0:37:25.240
and told Abraham that Sarah was going to have Isaac.

0:37:25.240,0:37:30.140
It happened 1 kilometre South of here.

0:37:30.140,0:37:37.680
This is where Abraham prayed the first prayer to God

0:37:37.680,0:37:44.340
and this is also the place where Abraham and Lot separated.

0:37:44.340,0:37:51.560
Lot went back to Sodom and Abraham went the other direction.

0:37:51.560,0:38:01.620
There is a tradition here and we are not sure which tradition it is, regarding these footprints.

0:38:01.620,0:38:08.420
We don’t know which tradition it is but it says these footprints are of Abraham when he prayed.

0:38:08.420,0:38:11.720
Do you see those two footprints?

0:38:11.720,0:38:15.140
It is a tradition. We think...

0:38:15.140,0:38:19.300
I brought an archeologist here about two months ago.

0:38:19.300,0:38:30.760
He told me that this is a Christian structure because it faces East, South East.

0:38:30.760,0:38:36.280
This is a Christian structure that was built 900 years ago.

Please come.

I want to remove my shoes.

OK.

0:39:04.740,0:39:07.060
Prophet T.B. Joshua In Hebron At The Footprints Of Abraham

0:39:07.060,0:39:13.700
James 2:23, "And the scripture was fulfilled which says, 'Abraham believed God,

0:39:13.700,0:39:23.560
and it was accounted to him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God".

0:39:23.560,0:39:27.620
I want to pray.

Prophet T.B. Joshua In Hebron At The Footprints Of Abraham

0:40:16.160,0:40:27.160
We left Jerusalem, we drove South on route 60 - this is the "Kings Road".

0:40:27.160,0:40:29.000
We drove to Hebron.

0:40:29.000,0:40:40.720
Then we drove out of Hebron and we took a right turn down here and we are right here.

0:40:40.720,0:40:53.660
We'd looked East into Jordan as I told you, and we would see the Dead Sea if we were here during the day.

0:40:53.660,0:41:01.260
Of course, it is not enough that Abraham our father was here.

0:41:01.260,0:41:03.760
Who was also here?

0:41:03.760,0:41:14.900
This is where King David wrote The Psalms as he fled from King Saul.

0:41:14.900,0:41:21.940
There is a village here at a junction, called Ziph.

0:41:21.940,0:41:30.580
It says in the Bible, that when King David, before he was king, was fleeing from King Saul,

0:41:30.580,0:41:37.560
because King Saul wanted to kill him, he was hiding in the village of Ziph.

0:41:37.560,0:41:44.160
The Ziphim came and wanted to extradite him to King Saul but it didn't happen in the end

0:41:44.160,0:41:50.300
because he said a special prayer to God.

0:41:50.300,0:41:54.800
It happened 500 meters from here.

0:42:07.820,0:42:12.680
Thank you.

0:42:12.680,0:42:14.500
It will be a good memory from here.

Prophet T.B. Joshua Prays At Traditional Location Of The First Recorded Prayer In The World, Hebron

0:43:48.800,0:43:56.180
Concluding this spiritual journey overlooking the ancient grounds of Hebron, Prophet T.B. Joshua takes a moment

0:43:56.180,0:44:02.080
for reflection in a sacred place, where God Almighty communed with His holy people,

0:44:02.080,0:44:05.060
as we can read in the Bible today.

0:44:05.060,0:44:11.940
As it was, so it is; the Lord speaks to our hearts through His Word by His Spirit.

0:44:11.940,0:44:15.180
And when God speaks, the wise listen.
