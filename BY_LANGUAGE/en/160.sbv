Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:14.060,0:00:16.060
My name is Ukeme Essien.

0:00:16.360,0:00:18.360
I was trained by

0:00:18.760,0:00:20.900
On oil and gas production operations.

0:00:21.680,0:00:25.760
Since I completed the training in 2007 December,

0:00:26.920,0:00:29.100
I had not had a job for six years.

0:00:29.800,0:00:33.240
I have been everywhere, went to so many companies,

0:00:33.940,0:00:36.540
did interviews and medical check ups,

0:00:36.540,0:00:40.060
but there was always an excuse 
why I wasn't given the job.

0:00:40.980,0:00:45.060
I came to SCOAN in April this year.

0:00:45.680,0:00:52.580
When I came, I got the anointing 
water and anointed my self.

0:00:53.600,0:00:55.980
That was on Sunday, 7th of April.

0:00:56.820,0:01:00.820
I had this oversees connection that refuses to be picking my calls.

0:01:00.820,0:01:02.560
Its a recruitment organisation.

0:01:03.220,0:01:07.440
Immediately after I anointed myself on that Sunday,

0:01:07.900,0:01:12.400
on Monday morning at 7:24 am on the 8th of April,

0:01:12.840,0:01:15.700
I received a call from oversees

0:01:16.340,0:01:20.900
that they want to see me in the United Arab Emirates

0:01:20.900,0:01:22.620
for a face to face interview.

0:01:22.980,0:01:30.580
So, they paid my ticket, paid for accommodation in a 5 
star hotel in UAE, Abu Dhabi.

0:01:31.340,0:01:35.900
Only 35 people were invited for
 the interview from all over the world.

0:01:37.340,0:01:40.320
Only two people were from Africa from among the 35,

0:01:41.180,0:01:43.900
Me and one other man from here in Lagos Nigeria.

0:01:44.160,0:01:46.138
When they called me for the interview,

0:01:46.140,0:01:49.000
I excused myself to go to the toilet and they approved.

0:01:49.900,0:01:53.520
When I got to the toilet, I used the anointing water and....

0:02:01.260,0:02:05.440
I sprayed the anointing water all over myself 
until I almost emptied the bottle.

0:02:06.420,0:02:10.880
I said that, as soon as they see my 
face they should see favor,

0:02:11.760,0:02:15.240
that I don't want them to ask me
 any question I don't know.

0:02:16.040,0:02:21.500
And that if there is any question I don't know
 if they ask me, they should answer it.

0:02:22.400,0:02:27.540
So i got in there, before then, one of the white man that was interviewing

0:02:27.540,0:02:32.640
us because I was the list among the 35 - the youngest.

0:02:32.640,0:02:36.340
He looked at me, again and again 
and I could read his mind.

0:02:36.680,0:02:40.040
It was like, "what is this small baby doing here among this adults are gathering?"

0:02:40.900,0:02:44.900
So, they called me in; as soon as I opened the door and went in

0:02:45.500,0:02:47.660
the white men there started laughing.

0:02:48.680,0:02:50.980
Its as If they have known me before.

0:02:51.360,0:02:55.540
I was scared; i wondered, could
 they be drunk or something?

0:02:56.020,0:02:59.360
Any little thing I said, they laugh 
and they would be so happy.

0:03:01.880,0:03:03.880
They interviewed me for one hour

0:03:04.360,0:03:08.460
and for every answer i gave they told me to go deeper and explain more.

0:03:09.200,0:03:14.520
After everything, the only question 
that they asked me which i did not know.

0:03:15.240,0:03:19.140
I spent like 10 seconds trying to 
think about it and they answered for me.

0:03:26.020,0:03:28.800
So I knew that the anointing water was at work.

0:03:30.280,0:03:32.280
They took me for medical check ups

0:03:32.880,0:03:35.660
and when i got there, there was an announcement that if

0:03:35.660,0:03:39.000
you are more than 45 years old you should come for another check up.

0:03:39.400,0:03:42.140
So when I saw the people that were sitting with me stand up,

0:03:42.560,0:03:44.120
i joined them to stand up.

0:03:44.640,0:03:49.600
So when i got there the American doctor that was doing the check up

0:03:49.860,0:03:52.007
said, "Go sit down you are a child, you are a child,

0:03:52.007,0:03:54.500
I am talking about adults, you are a child, go sit down."

0:03:54.720,0:03:56.720
So everybody started laughing at me

0:03:57.160,0:03:59.980
so in the end, they gave me this appointment letter.

0:04:03.140,0:04:04.180
Praise the Lord!

0:04:05.100,0:04:07.460
I am entitled to a brand new car every two year and

0:04:08.500,0:04:13.520
the payment is well over 14 million naira.

0:04:16.180,0:04:18.180
That is my payment that is what 
they will pay me.

0:04:18.620,0:04:23.900
And a very big house going for 
4.7 million Naira every year rent.

0:04:24.440,0:04:28.500
I decided not to hide such a testimony.

0:04:28.800,0:04:32.060
I said I should come and share it for the glory of God.

0:04:32.180,0:04:36.500
They made me the field services foreman,

0:04:36.820,0:04:38.640
which is the head of all the technicians.

0:04:38.640,0:04:39.380
So I thank God.

0:04:40.660,0:04:42.660
which I thank God.

0:04:42.660,0:04:43.880
{Which company?}

0:04:45.980,0:04:50.360
The name of the company is 
Abu Dhabi company for onshore oil operation.

0:04:50.680,0:04:53.820
Its an oil company, this is their clinic where they did my medical check ups.

0:04:54.380,0:04:56.180
This is the five star hotel where they lodge me.

0:04:56.220,0:04:57.720
{What were you doing before,

0:04:57.840,0:04:59.840
from the level you were before to this new level,

0:04:59.840,0:05:01.360
tell us?}

0:05:02.120,0:05:05.180
Before, I was just moving around teaching in secondary schools.

0:05:05.860,0:05:06.860
{On the streets?}

0:05:06.940,0:05:10.720
Yes, and they were paying me 8000 Naira per month.

0:05:10.980,0:05:13.640
{No, look! don't say this in public.}

0:05:16.040,0:05:23.360
Teaching part time, in the evening you
 will go to school and teach the children.

0:05:24.140,0:05:27.780
From morning to evening you will 
be moving in the street roaming about.

0:05:28.640,0:05:30.180
8000 to millions.}

0:05:32.720,0:05:38.820
[Applause]

0:05:39.320,0:05:44.340
{This is what I heard from God when
 I was given this anointing water.

0:05:45.060,0:05:47.060
The transformation will be so great.

0:05:52.020,0:05:56.360
Look brother, to go on and on your first salary

0:05:56.460,0:06:02.540
you will only take the money you need to for transport and food.

0:06:02.960,0:06:11.020
Take it and look round for the less privileged and raise their standard.

0:06:11.900,0:06:16.500
[applause]

0:06:16.980,0:06:21.218
After that, you can now begin to 
remove money that

0:06:21.220,0:06:23.660
will not affect you, your living.

0:06:24.040,0:06:29.140
Remove it and take it down and continue to take care of the less privileged.

0:06:29.700,0:06:35.840
If you do that, in six month you will be transferred
 from this place to another place.}

0:06:36.180,0:06:40.460
[applause]

0:06:40.480,0:06:41.640
Praise the lord!

0:06:42.140,0:06:45.480
{Be a good citizen as you are going

0:06:46.080,0:06:48.080
please, be a good citizen.

0:06:48.740,0:06:54.680
The name of your country, please is very dear.}

0:06:56.640,0:06:58.040
Thank you man of God, I am very grateful.

0:06:58.580,0:07:00.840
{What is your advice in the whole world

0:07:00.840,0:07:03.000
and the people that are still there

0:07:03.000,0:07:04.760
where you are coming from.}

0:07:05.280,0:07:06.000
Praise God!

0:07:07.440,0:07:10.180
First and foremost, I am grateful to the man of God.

0:07:11.140,0:07:17.760
I want to advise everyone here that the 
Anointing water is one stop shop.

0:07:18.800,0:07:23.460
Once you get the anointing water, 
whatsoever is the problem is over.

0:07:24.300,0:07:28.020
You can Imagine i am the only person
 that was selected from Africa.

0:07:28.400,0:07:30.860
Just like that, I knew no body there.

0:07:31.340,0:07:35.780
But as small as I am, the anointing 
water made me great.

0:07:35.900,0:07:37.220
I give God all the praise!

0:07:37.220,0:07:38.680
{Amen, Thank you, thank you!}
