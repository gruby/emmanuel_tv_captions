Good Morning, Church!

0:00:02.100,0:00:04.840
Greet your neighbour, "Good Morning!"

0:00:04.840,0:00:08.080
Greet the viewers, "Good Morning!"

0:00:08.080,0:00:14.340
Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, you are in the presence of God!"

0:00:14.340,0:00:20.640
Today is the day that the Lord has made.

0:00:20.640,0:00:28.920
I will rejoice and be glad in it, in Jesus‘ name.

0:00:28.920,0:00:31.800
Have your seat. Thank You, Lord.

0:00:31.800,0:00:40.520
This message today will be given in two languages: in English and French, as instructed by the Prophet.

0:00:40.520,0:00:55.580
God has made wonderful promises and they are for you, personally.

0:00:55.580,0:01:01.240
But unfortunately today, many find it difficult to believe

0:01:01.240,0:01:05.400
that God’s promise can be fulfilled in their lives.

0:01:05.400,0:01:14.280

0:01:14.280,0:01:17.440
We have a challenge today.

0:01:17.440,0:01:21.100
We are too conditioned to believe

0:01:21.100,0:01:28.740
that what we read in the Bible is for the people in the Bible alone, not for us today.

0:01:28.740,0:01:30.840
We are too conditioned to believe

0:01:30.840,0:01:36.040
that what God says can happen to others, will not happen to us.

0:01:36.040,0:01:47.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:47.720,0:01:52.200
It is not by power; it is not by might.

0:01:52.200,0:02:00.080
It is according to the grace of God.

0:02:00.080,0:02:09.260
By grace, Jesus met Levi, a tax collector and made him Apostle Matthew.

0:02:09.260,0:02:17.060
By grace, Jesus met a murderer sentenced to death at the cross and gave him eternal life.

0:02:17.060,0:02:26.400
By grace, Jesus met Saul, a state prosecutor and made him the great Apostle Paul.

0:02:26.400,0:02:34.100
By grace, God chose Prophet T.B. Joshua and made him a prophet to the nations,

0:02:34.100,0:02:44.140
a mentor to millions, a channel of shining light giving illumination to the whole world.

0:02:44.140,0:03:05.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:05.020,0:03:14.520
Today, by the grace of God, Jesus will change your life, if you believe.

0:03:14.520,0:03:21.860
If you believe today, the Lord will change your life in the same way, in Jesus‘ name!

0:03:21.860,0:03:35.760
God always asks us to do what we cannot do ourselves so that He can teach us how to do it.

0:03:35.760,0:03:42.220
When you allow God to transform you by the power of the Holy Spirit,

0:03:42.220,0:03:46.380
then He will literally begin to show you the way.

0:03:46.380,0:03:52.660
Then, you can know what God wants you to do and how He wants you to do it.

0:03:52.660,0:04:05.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:05.860,0:04:10.980
If you believe, that transforming power will change your life today.

0:04:10.980,0:04:12.660
Do you believe that?

0:04:12.660,0:04:18.700
Let someone say, 'The transforming power'.

0:04:18.700,0:04:22.460
This is our message today: 'The transforming power'.

0:04:22.460,0:04:29.860
Let’s open our Bible to the book of Genesis 1:1.

0:04:29.860,0:04:34.020
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

0:04:34.020,0:04:40.460
The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.

0:04:40.460,0:04:45.240
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

0:04:45.240,0:04:51.060
Then God said, 'Let there be light‘; and there was light.

0:04:51.060,0:04:57.460
And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.

0:04:57.460,0:05:03.600
God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.

0:05:03.600,0:05:06.740
So the evening and the morning were the first day.“

0:05:06.740,0:05:09.600
Good Morning to you all!

0:05:09.600,0:05:12.940
Good Morning to my life!

0:05:12.940,0:05:15.780
Good Morning to my career!

0:05:15.780,0:05:19.440
Good Morning to my destiny!

0:05:19.440,0:05:23.840
Is your life unformed and void?

0:05:23.840,0:05:30.940
Follow Jesus. Jesus is the Repairer and the Restorer.

0:05:30.940,0:05:38.760
He came to earth to transform our lives from darkness to light

0:05:38.760,0:05:44.580
and to make us partakers of the divine inheritance of the saints.

0:05:44.580,0:05:59.980

0:05:59.980,0:06:06.100
In 1 Samuel 9:21, Prophet Samuel came to anoint Saul,

0:06:06.100,0:06:12.740
and Saul answered, 'Am I not from the land of Benjamin, the least tribe of Israel?‘

0:06:12.740,0:06:18.760
When God sent the angel to Gideon to establish him as a judge of Israel,

0:06:18.760,0:06:23.040
Gideon said, 'My family is the poorest in Mannaseh‘.

0:06:23.040,0:06:30.440
He focused on his weakness; he focused on his poor family background.

0:06:30.440,0:06:35.500
When God called Moses to lead His people into the Promised Land,

0:06:35.500,0:06:41.280
Moses said, 'Lord, I cannot speak‘.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:05.980,0:07:09.760
I want to tell you just one story.

0:07:09.760,0:07:13.920
One day, the Prophet preached one message and said,

0:07:13.920,0:07:21.620
"There was one disciple that was too quiet. He didn’t want to talk“.

0:07:21.620,0:07:25.540
That disciple is me; I’m the one.

0:07:25.540,0:07:32.760
I could not talk when I came here. I was too afraid to talk.

0:07:32.760,0:07:34.760
This lasted for long.

0:07:34.760,0:07:37.760
When I saw the Prophet preach, I would say, "Wow.

0:07:37.760,0:07:42.380
I will never be able to face the crowd and speak. It is too much for me“.

0:07:42.380,0:07:46.960
But glory be to God, I’m serving a man of vision.

0:07:46.960,0:07:51.480
He called me and spoke to me one day.

0:07:51.480,0:07:57.440
In class, when the Prophet said, „Who has a message?“, everybody raised their hand.

0:07:57.440,0:07:58.960
I raised my hand.

0:07:58.960,0:08:01.040
When he looked towards me, I took my hand down.

0:08:01.040,0:08:04.040
But he had seen me already.

0:08:04.040,0:08:08.860
He told me, „Ok, you are going to preach tomorrow“.

0:08:08.860,0:08:13.280
I said, „Heh? Im going to preach in the church?“

0:08:13.280,0:08:17.680
My heart started pounding.

0:08:17.680,0:08:19.880
I could not sleep the whole day.

0:08:19.880,0:08:24.460
Night closed in. I said, "Maybe Prophet just said it to test my faith".

0:08:24.460,0:08:27.720
When the time came, someone said, "Dress up. Prophet is calling you“.

0:08:27.720,0:08:33.500
I went and he said, "Are you ready? Ok, go and preach the message“.

0:08:33.500,0:08:36.400
The time I left, my heart…

0:08:36.400,0:08:41.280
I was saying, "Lord, how will I start? How will I do it?“

0:08:41.280,0:08:50.260
But the moment they gave me the mic, grace entered me.

0:08:50.260,0:08:53.300
Where God guides, He provides.

0:08:53.300,0:08:57.880
Where God guides, He provides and protects.

0:08:57.880,0:09:03.060
God Almighty oftentimes uses His messengers, servants

0:09:03.060,0:09:07.760
among those who have the least advantage of natural talent.

0:09:07.760,0:09:13.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:13.200,0:09:21.480
How strange but wholly true, the weak, full of power the Father’s work will do.

0:09:21.480,0:09:28.880
This explains why a young, rustic and seemingly inexperienced David

0:09:28.880,0:09:34.180
could be able to defeat Goliath in representative combat.

0:09:34.180,0:09:42.660
This explains why Moses, the son of a Hebrew slave, was able to stand before Pharaoh

0:09:42.660,0:09:46.400
and proclaim the oracle of God.

0:09:46.400,0:09:55.200
This explains why people without mighty strength, fast legs, smoothness of tongue

0:09:55.200,0:10:03.260
should ever remain faithful to God for the purpose God has designed and called them for.

0:10:03.260,0:10:24.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:24.180,0:10:32.120
It is not by power, not by might but by His grace.

0:10:32.120,0:10:37.240
Lord, I know You can change me.

0:10:37.240,0:10:44.460
Lord, I am here for the radical transformation of my life.

0:10:44.460,0:10:48.340
I know You can do it for me.

0:10:48.340,0:10:56.080
If you believe, He will do it for you today, in Jesus‘ name.

0:10:56.080,0:11:09.880
Those whom God calls for any service, He makes them fit for it.

0:11:09.880,0:11:16.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:16.480,0:11:22.260
That is the reason why God sent His Son, Jesus, to you and me.

0:11:22.260,0:11:29.620
Jesus Christ can change anyone – anywhere, anytime.

0:11:29.620,0:11:42.500
In John 15:3, Jesus said, 'You are already pure because of the Word I have spoken to you‘.

0:11:42.500,0:11:49.200
This means, Jesus has come to brush aside our unworthy past

0:11:49.200,0:11:56.700
and to bring us to the presence of the living Father without any sense of unworthiness.

0:11:56.700,0:12:21.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:21.500,0:12:28.160
Jesus can change anyone – anywhere, anytime.

0:12:28.160,0:12:34.500
Jesus is looking for someone to change today. Are you the one?

0:12:34.500,0:12:36.740
Begin to rejoice!

0:12:36.740,0:12:48.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:48.420,0:12:55.480
Do you believe what God said to Gideon and Saul can happen to you?

0:12:55.480,0:12:59.580
If you are too conditioned to believe that what God said cannot happen to you,

0:12:59.580,0:13:03.500
let me encourage your faith.

0:13:03.500,0:13:13.380
Success, greatness is not about our weaknesses, faults, pitfalls.

0:13:13.380,0:13:17.540
It is all about what Jesus has done for you at the Cross of Calvary.

0:13:17.540,0:13:24.460
He has made you fit and qualified you for God’s purpose in your life.

0:13:24.460,0:13:51.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:51.900,0:14:08.920
You don’t need to be perfect to be used by God. You just need to be available.

0:14:08.920,0:14:14.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:14.520,0:14:20.540
Are you available to Him? Are you available? Follow Jesus.

0:14:20.540,0:14:27.540
If you follow Him, your life will never be the same.

0:14:27.540,0:14:32.480
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:14:32.480,0:14:38.740
Remember what he said to the disciples in Luke 10:20:

0:14:38.740,0:14:48.280
Do not rejoice that demons are subject to you but rejoice that your names are written in Heaven‘.

0:14:48.280,0:15:02.580
Knowing God is not only to see His miracles but to learn His ways.

0:15:02.580,0:15:05.620
When we learn the way of God,

0:15:05.620,0:15:12.860
then we should follow the path of faith and humility that leads to safety and eternal life.

0:15:12.860,0:15:17.520
Jesus‘ disciples followed the divine process of God.

0:15:17.520,0:15:25.420
They knew there is a time to march with God and a time to march for God.

0:15:25.420,0:15:32.980
They followed the divine principles and they met the requirement of deeper commitment to God.

0:15:32.980,0:15:36.020
And the Spirit of the Father came upon them

0:15:36.020,0:15:41.140
and made them pearls of usefulness for generations yet unborn.

0:15:41.140,0:15:45.620
They are our mirrors today.

0:15:45.620,0:15:50.460
If you want to be God’s person, follow His process.

0:15:50.460,0:15:58.340
If you want to be the man God created, follow His process.

0:15:58.340,0:16:38.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:38.040,0:16:42.580
Jesus Christ is concerned about you.

0:16:42.580,0:16:50.640
Jesus is concerned about me; Jesus is concerned about you.

0:16:50.640,0:17:00.020
God Almighty is much more interested about our future than our present state.

0:17:00.020,0:17:07.540
He knows that success has many dangers of its own.

0:17:07.540,0:17:16.080
He knows that when we come to the top, our spiritual life may gradually deterioriate.

0:17:16.080,0:17:22.280
That is why God Almighty is busy building character now

0:17:22.280,0:17:27.320
so that when you reach the place of your divine assignment,

0:17:27.320,0:17:32.840
you may not crack, explode and lose it all.

0:17:32.840,0:17:43.240
Our conduct, our character must change to agree with God’s plan for our lives.

Dedication and discipline are the fruit of victory.

0:18:28.400,0:18:31.480
Physical growth is the function of time;

0:18:31.480,0:18:35.920
intellectual growth is the function of learning

0:18:35.920,0:18:40.120
but spiritual growth is the function of obedience to God.

Brethren, today is your day.

0:19:00.260,0:19:05.800
Today, we believe that the transforming power of God will make your impossibilities possible.

0:19:05.800,0:19:11.780
The Gospel of God’s grace challenges and changes everything.

0:19:11.780,0:19:15.960
To His transforming power, nothing is impossible.

0:19:15.960,0:19:31.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:31.940,0:19:36.060
It is God’s power working through His Word by His Spirit

0:19:36.060,0:19:41.320
that brings about a new birth and a radical transformation of our lives.

0:19:41.320,0:19:45.000
How do we know the power of God?

0:19:45.000,0:19:56.900
To know God’s presence is to know His power.

0:19:56.900,0:20:00.820
How do we know the presence of God then?

0:20:00.820,0:20:12.640
The Word of God is the living presence of the divine power.

0:20:12.640,0:20:18.600
The Spirit of God will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of the Word of God.

0:20:18.600,0:20:23.200
God is with us in the living Word.

0:20:23.200,0:20:26.640
How do we know God?

0:20:26.640,0:20:30.580
We know God by the Word He speaks

0:20:30.580,0:20:35.020
and the Word God speaks represents His heart’s desire for me and for you.

0:20:35.020,0:20:56.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:56.720,0:21:08.620
The Word has priority over His name.

0:21:08.620,0:21:16.000
When you take God’s Word to heart by meditation and truly make it a part of you,

0:21:16.000,0:21:19.540
it will, by its very nature, change you.

0:21:19.540,0:21:25.320
Christ’s eternal Word enables us to stop reliving the past in our present lives.

0:21:25.320,0:21:38.220
Christ’s eternal Word enables me to stop reliving the past in my present life.

0:21:38.220,0:21:43.280
When you receive the living Word in the midst of your heart,

0:21:43.280,0:21:51.680
the past will no longer control your thinking pattern, will never control your behaviour.

0:21:51.680,0:21:54.940
When you receive the living Word of Christ in the midst of your heart,

0:21:54.940,0:21:59.500
the past will no longer control your thinking pattern or your behaviour.

0:21:59.500,0:22:07.740
Then, you will begin to think not of your weakness, not of yourself

0:22:07.740,0:22:11.920
but of your righteousness in Christ Jesus.

0:22:11.920,0:22:13.680
Do you believe that?

0:22:13.680,0:22:19.460
Today, my impossibilities will become possible.

0:22:19.460,0:22:28.980
Today, I believe my life will never be the same again.

0:22:28.980,0:22:31.160
Believe the Word of God.

0:22:31.160,0:22:36.280
Trust in the Word of God and your life will never be the same.

0:22:36.280,0:22:37.940
Thank You, Jesus.

0:22:37.940,0:22:39.940
May God bless His Word.
