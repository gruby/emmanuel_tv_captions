The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:24.220,0:00:28.720
Good Morning once again.

0:00:28.720,0:00:31.440
Your spirit is lifted up.

0:00:31.440,0:00:34.400
I can't hear you.

0:00:34.400,0:00:42.140
Yes, so if your faith is enhanced and you have found yourself there,

0:00:42.140,0:00:44.940
what are we expecting from you?

0:00:44.940,0:00:58.440
The Spirit will increase to the degree you stand in reverence of His Word.

0:00:58.440,0:01:00.240
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:00.240,0:01:16.540
The Spirit will increase to the degree you stand in reverence of His Word.

0:01:16.540,0:01:18.140
Are you with me?

0:01:18.140,0:01:34.260
The Spirit of God will increase to the degree you stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.

0:01:34.260,0:01:36.280
I hope you honour His Word.

0:01:36.280,0:01:41.940
Ask your neighbour, "How much do you value the Word of God?"

0:01:41.940,0:01:43.240
I can't hear you.

0:01:43.240,0:01:45.440
How much do you value the Word of God?

0:01:45.440,0:01:49.560
That is it. When you say, "In Jesus' name",

0:01:49.560,0:02:03.580
the power that flows from His name will be in proportion to your love for His Word.

0:02:03.580,0:02:07.040
"In Jesus' name!"

0:02:07.040,0:02:09.700
People see it as a tradition - "Amen."

0:02:09.700,0:02:14.380
Even if you don't believe, you say, "Amen".

0:02:14.380,0:02:20.180
The power that will flow from His name - "In Jesus' name" -

0:02:20.180,0:02:26.840
will be in proportion to your love for His Word.

0:02:26.840,0:02:28.360
"In Jesus' name."

0:02:28.360,0:02:32.140
So you can know if you love Jesus and

0:02:32.140,0:02:39.200
you can know how much you love Jesus through "In Jesus' name".

0:02:39.200,0:02:41.480
So some people say, "I know".

0:02:41.480,0:02:44.220
"How much do you love Jesus?" - they say, "I don't know".

0:02:44.220,0:02:47.060
If you don't know how much you love Jesus - okay.

0:02:47.060,0:02:53.920
"We used to pray at home" or when I'm praying, "In Jesus' name", you say, "Amen".

0:02:53.920,0:03:05.340
The power that flows from His name will be in proportion to your love for His Word.

0:03:05.340,0:03:08.120
You can know how much you love Jesus. Tell your neighbour.

0:03:08.120,0:03:10.380
You can know how much you love Jesus.

0:03:10.380,0:03:11.700
Again.

0:03:11.700,0:03:14.280
You can know how much you love Jesus.

0:03:14.280,0:03:18.700
You say, "How much do I love Jesus. I don't know what you are talking about".

0:03:18.700,0:03:21.100
Any moment from now, I will say, "Be delivered!".

0:03:21.100,0:03:29.500
What happens determines how much I love Jesus.

0:03:29.500,0:03:32.920
"Be healed!"

0:03:32.920,0:03:46.940
The power that flows from His name - "Be healed" - will be in proportion to my love for His Word.

0:03:46.940,0:03:51.120
If there is no love, He cannot come into the scene.

0:03:51.120,0:03:56.660
"In Jesus' name" - He cannot come out - "What are you saying? What do you want me to do?"

0:03:56.660,0:04:03.020
Without love - no. Because Himself is love.

0:04:03.020,0:04:07.320
Ask your neighbour, "How much do you love Jesus?"

0:04:07.320,0:04:09.380
You can know.

0:04:09.380,0:04:12.560
Tell your neighbour, "You can know".

0:04:12.560,0:04:13.860
I can't hear you.

0:04:13.860,0:04:19.120
You can know how much you love Jesus.

0:04:19.120,0:04:29.460
To love Jesus more and more is by attending to His Word and keeping His Word in your heart.

0:04:29.460,0:04:34.400
Because His word is your life and health to your flesh.

0:04:34.400,0:04:38.980
People keep saying, "How will I believe?"

0:04:38.980,0:04:46.560
There is no other way to believe than to act on what God has spoken.

0:04:46.560,0:04:48.640
That is it.

0:04:48.640,0:04:53.260
Act on what God has what? - Spoken.

0:04:53.260,0:04:58.420
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not destroy, though shall not this.

0:04:58.420,0:05:01.040
Act on what God has spoken.

0:05:01.040,0:05:08.480
Believing demands action.

0:05:08.480,0:05:11.540
Action.

0:05:11.540,0:05:18.320
The problem of believing is made easy, simple

0:05:18.320,0:05:24.480
when we know that it is acting on what God has spoken.

0:05:24.480,0:05:27.520
Simple.

0:05:27.520,0:05:31.920
"How will I believe now? I thought I believe."

0:05:31.920,0:05:38.880
That is why the book of Romans 10:9-10 says that in our heart we believe.

0:05:38.880,0:05:40.800
How can we believe in our heart?

0:05:40.800,0:05:48.880
To believe in our heart means our spirit - that is our heart - acting upon the Word.

0:05:48.880,0:05:50.800
That is the meaning.

0:05:50.800,0:05:59.260
Our heart - means spirit - acts upon the Word of God.

0:05:59.260,0:06:04.580
That means, it is not mental assent, it is not something we can memorise;

0:06:04.580,0:06:09.180
it must become an integral part of you.

0:06:09.180,0:06:17.980
When the Word of God begins to dominate your heart, you begin to believe.

0:06:17.980,0:06:19.360
Can you see?

0:06:19.360,0:06:21.580
It is not when you memorise.

0:06:21.580,0:06:25.000
When it is here, you can preach or teach it. - No.

0:06:25.000,0:06:33.380
When the Word of God begins to dominate your heart - that is your spirit - you begin to believe.

0:06:33.380,0:06:40.720
When you begin to believe, your character and your conduct will begin to be influenced.

0:06:40.720,0:06:46.060
The way you behaved before - you lie - you are just seeing yourself, "Thou shall not lie!"

0:06:46.060,0:06:50.060
You hate - you realise, "Thou shall not hate!"

0:06:50.060,0:06:55.420
Acting on the Word is letting God act through you.

0:06:55.420,0:07:03.600
Acting on the Word then gives God an opportunity to heal you, to talk to you,

0:07:03.600,0:07:10.440
to eat with you and to speak to you.

0:07:10.440,0:07:13.740
All what you are seeing talks much about faith.

0:07:13.740,0:07:20.820
Don't forget that it is this faith that releases the belief in our heart.

0:07:20.820,0:07:31.040
The belief will remain locked but faith will take the key, open and ask the belief to come out.

0:07:31.040,0:07:39.200
If not, the belief will remain there perpetually but faith unlocks the belief.

0:07:39.200,0:07:47.020
"Since I believe" but where is the faith to open the door for belief to come out?

0:07:47.020,0:07:52.020
Christians believe today but their belief is dormant because it is imprisoned.

0:07:52.020,0:07:54.420
Their belief is imprisoned without faith.

0:07:54.420,0:07:56.020
"I have money."

0:07:56.020,0:07:57.620
"Where is the money?"

0:07:57.620,0:07:59.100
"It is in the bank."

0:07:59.100,0:08:00.140
"Go and cash it."

0:08:00.140,0:08:01.760
But you cannot cash it.

0:08:01.760,0:08:06.320
You know that you have money. It is there. It is saved.

0:08:06.320,0:08:11.600
That is the same - belief without faith.

0:08:11.600,0:08:23.520
Faith is practical; it is action.

0:08:23.520,0:08:28.600
Like a good example I was giving you some time ago.

0:08:28.600,0:08:36.040
You pray because you saw the weather change, becoming darker,

0:08:36.040,0:08:40.760
and you are about to go to work.

0:08:40.760,0:08:45.840
It seems it's about to rain, and you need to go to work.

0:08:45.840,0:08:49.180
You now say that you are a Christian and go down on your knees

0:08:49.180,0:08:55.700
to say, "Lord, stop this rain!"

0:08:55.700,0:09:03.740
And you say to yourself, you have the conviction that God will stop the rain, and you say, "Amen!"

0:09:03.740,0:09:06.280
You laugh and dress up.

0:09:06.280,0:09:14.020
While going, you take an umbrella along with you.

0:09:14.020,0:09:16.400
What is the purpose of that umbrella?

0:09:16.400,0:09:18.940
In case it rains.

0:09:18.940,0:09:23.920
That nullifies your faith.

0:09:23.920,0:09:28.340
That is out of unbelief.

0:09:28.340,0:09:32.860
That is belief without faith.

0:09:32.860,0:09:43.180
It's like you were worried before that some people would come and disturb you - attack you.

0:09:43.180,0:09:52.660
Now you pray. After the prayer, you continue that worry, distress.

0:09:52.660,0:09:57.120
Belief without faith.

0:09:57.120,0:10:03.880
You are here for the salvation of your soul and some issue you want God to attend to.

0:10:03.880,0:10:09.560
Now having access to sit and watch, being right inside the church at last,

0:10:09.560,0:10:12.040
why do you still begin to worry again?

0:10:12.040,0:10:17.700
You believe without faith.

0:10:17.700,0:10:22.280
The belief in our heart is released by faith.

0:10:22.280,0:10:26.700
How can that your belief be released?

0:10:26.700,0:10:30.340
That's a good question.

0:10:30.340,0:10:46.060
The power that flows from His name, Jesus, will be in proportion to our love for His Word.

0:10:46.060,0:10:49.060
You can know if you are a Christian.

0:10:49.060,0:10:53.260
You can know how much He loves you.

0:10:53.260,0:10:57.440
You can know.

0:10:57.440,0:11:00.300
Can I ask you a question? How much do you love Jesus?

0:11:00.300,0:11:02.580
Very much.

0:11:02.580,0:11:08.340
Very much? Not how much Jesus loves you because He always loves you.

0:11:08.340,0:11:09.660
Okay?

0:11:09.660,0:11:11.860
How much do you love Jesus?

0:11:11.860,0:11:18.200
I believe that my life depends on Jesus. I can't live without Him.

0:11:18.200,0:11:24.680
You mean your life depends on Jesus; you cannot live without Him.

0:11:24.680,0:11:27.300
May you accept Him as your Creator?

0:11:27.300,0:11:30.220
Yes, I accept Jesus as my great Creator.

0:11:30.220,0:11:33.980
But you have not accepted Him as your Guardian.

0:11:33.980,0:11:41.420
He created you - you agree. But you would never agree that He should guide you.

0:11:41.420,0:11:43.600
That is it.

0:11:43.600,0:11:45.380
Are you with me?

0:11:45.380,0:11:51.160
You can create something and allow that thing to be guided by something else.

0:11:51.160,0:11:53.520
That is the life we live.

0:11:53.520,0:12:01.840
We accept Him as our Creator but we never see Him as our Guardian.

0:12:01.840,0:12:08.120
See Him as your Creator. Now see Him as your Guardian.

0:12:08.120,0:12:22.380
You can't create something and then give it to another creator to guide it - justl ike adoption.

0:12:22.380,0:12:28.000
You need to know how much you love Jesus, and not how much Jesus loves you.

0:12:28.000,0:12:32.180
Jesus loves you so much.

0:12:32.180,0:12:37.960
How much you love Him - that is the question now.

0:12:37.960,0:12:44.440
So how can you wake up in the morning, you pray without direction?

0:12:44.440,0:12:51.080
Not that you sense His presence to pray.

0:12:51.080,0:13:01.580
You just see it as a reason - conventional, the way you were brought up that you must wake up and pray.

0:13:01.580,0:13:06.400
At such time you must pray - not that you sense His presence,

0:13:06.400,0:13:09.120
not that He instructs you or you hear...

0:13:09.120,0:13:15.460
I mean, if I pray for you now - you say you are sick and I pray for you -

0:13:15.460,0:13:24.480
I must sense God's healing touching you before I can say, "You are healed".

0:13:24.480,0:13:33.760
If I do not sense God's healing touching you and I say, "You are healed", this means I'm fake.

0:13:33.760,0:13:40.740
I must sense God's healing touching you and say, "Ah, you are healed".

0:13:40.740,0:13:47.140
By the time you do this - "Ah, I am healed!"

0:13:47.140,0:13:50.720
I must sense God's healing touching you;

0:13:50.720,0:13:55.560
I must sense God's deliverance and God's blessing touching you.

0:13:55.560,0:13:59.280
If I don't know whom you are in the spirit, how will I be telling you -

0:13:59.280,0:14:03.220
"You are this, you are that", and just guess.

0:14:03.220,0:14:09.600
We don't follow Him in guessing, on our own.

0:14:09.600,0:14:14.720
Do you listen to what you are saying because all on your mind is to receive healing?

0:14:14.720,0:14:17.440
You don't know how much you love Jesus.

0:14:17.440,0:14:21.040
Yes, Man of God.

0:14:21.040,0:14:23.280
That is why you are here.

0:14:23.280,0:14:24.660
Yes.

0:14:24.660,0:14:27.460
Do you want to know how much?

0:14:27.460,0:14:28.900
Yes, Man of God.

0:14:28.900,0:14:34.760
By attending to His word, allowing His word in the midst of your heart

0:14:34.760,0:14:39.460
and seeing His word as your life and healing to your flesh.

0:14:39.460,0:14:41.260
Yes, Man of God.

0:14:41.260,0:14:49.980
You are here now for healing and you say you believe but you are still worried.

0:14:49.980,0:14:55.880
That worry nullifies your faith.

0:14:55.880,0:14:57.060
Okay, Man of God.

0:14:57.060,0:15:01.060
If you have faith - don't just believe but you have faith -

0:15:01.060,0:15:05.840
you'll begin to give thanks to God even when that healing has not even come.

0:15:05.840,0:15:08.620
Okay, Man of God.

0:15:08.620,0:15:10.180
Yes, Man of God.

0:15:10.180,0:15:17.120
Difficulty in walking due to lumbar spondylosis and osteoarthritis in my knees,

0:15:17.120,0:15:22.660
tighs, back, waist and feet.

0:15:22.660,0:15:33.280
Healing In Jesus' Name

0:15:33.280,0:15:36.680
Come.

0:15:36.680,0:15:39.400
Thank You, Jesus!

0:15:39.400,0:15:46.280
The reason why I said, "Come on" is because I could sense God's healing touching you.

0:15:46.280,0:15:50.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:50.060,0:15:51.500
Thank You, Jesus!

0:15:51.500,0:15:52.260
Remove it.

0:15:52.260,0:15:54.920
Thank You, Jesus!

0:15:54.920,0:15:59.760
Healed In Jesus' Name

0:15:59.760,0:16:05.800
Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:05.800,0:16:08.720
I am healed! Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:08.720,0:16:10.540
Thank you, Man of God!

0:16:10.540,0:16:16.460
Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:16.460,0:16:22.600
I can run! Thank You, Jesus!

0:16:22.600,0:16:25.720
Thank You, Jesus! I am healed!

0:16:25.720,0:16:29.800
For so many years suffering with arthritis!

0:16:29.800,0:16:33.880
Thank You, Jesus! I can dance!

0:16:33.880,0:16:46.180
The Spirit will be released to the degree that we stand in reverence of His Word.

0:16:46.180,0:16:48.160
How do we reverence His Word?

0:16:48.160,0:16:52.800
By attending to His Word and allowing His Word in the midst of our hearts,

0:16:52.800,0:16:58.640
seeing His Word as our life and healing to all our flesh.

0:16:58.640,0:17:02.740
What happened to this woman now has affected you there.

0:17:02.740,0:17:08.600
I mean, as this woman was healed, you were healed there. You don't know.

0:17:08.600,0:17:13.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:13.120,0:17:18.960
But he is still carrying the gadget - carrying everything.

0:17:18.960,0:17:22.260
"Until the man touches me or talks to me."

0:17:22.260,0:17:29.780
As the woman was healed here, I could sense God's healing touching you.

0:17:29.780,0:17:35.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:35.100,0:17:39.700
Take this thing from your mouth.

0:17:39.700,0:17:42.480
Stand up, you are healed!

0:17:42.480,0:17:52.640

I can breathe!

0:17:57.660,0:18:04.040
I feel cold air coming into me. I was hot before but now I feel my body cold.

0:18:04.040,0:18:07.340
Why should I be the one to tell you?

0:18:07.340,0:18:10.820
Was it before I told you? Or?

0:18:10.820,0:18:16.440
As soon as that lady stood up there and started running, I felt the cold come to me.

Go and tell them! Tell people and mention that!

Look.

When ten sick people are together, if one is healed by the power of God, all the others are healed.

It is a flame; the power is like a smoke.

0:18:44.440,0:18:53.860
If I prepare fire here, the smoke that will come out, every assembly will smell it.
