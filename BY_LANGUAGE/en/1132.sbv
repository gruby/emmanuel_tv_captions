Viewers all over the world, thank you. Thank you for your time.

0:00:04.040,0:00:06.700
I hope you are enjoying your time.

0:00:06.700,0:00:10.580
Time with Jesus - wonderful!

0:00:10.580,0:00:13.700
Hallelujah!

0:00:13.700,0:00:29.360
As I look at true believers, many Christians, I do not forget the many insults,

0:00:29.360,0:00:34.760
I do not forget the many persecutions,

0:00:34.760,0:00:47.580
I do not forget the many temptations they endure to maintain their Christian life.

0:00:47.580,0:00:49.720
Are you with me?

0:00:49.720,0:01:01.700
Injustice, pain, the opposition they endure to maintain their walk with the Lord.

0:01:01.700,0:01:10.460
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:01:10.460,0:01:15.820
I think I'm going to build my message this morning around this.

0:01:15.820,0:01:19.360
Hallelujah!

0:01:19.360,0:01:24.120
I'm going to call it, 'The Secret Of True Believers'

0:01:24.120,0:01:26.240
because it is my secret - people don't know.

0:01:26.240,0:01:32.520
They see it as pain; they see it as a punishment.

0:01:32.520,0:01:41.040
Like what Job's wife said to him, "You say, you are a friend of God, God loves you so much.

0:01:41.040,0:01:48.060
Why are you going through all this pain, all this agony?"

0:01:48.060,0:01:53.580
Job said to his wife, "Why are you saying this?

0:01:53.580,0:02:02.320
Someone gave you butter, salad and later now gave you bitter leaf.

0:02:02.320,0:02:04.480
Why can't you take it?"

0:02:04.480,0:02:08.180
We have been eating the salad for so long.

0:02:08.180,0:02:12.220
and when bitter leaf now comes, we should take it.

0:02:12.220,0:02:16.520
Life is both sides - positive and negative.

0:02:16.520,0:02:19.160
Hallelujah.

0:02:19.160,0:02:27.880
Let's take our reading from the book of James 1:1-4.

0:02:27.880,0:02:29.480
That is our reading.

0:02:29.480,0:02:33.500
But in other books you will find this that will help you:

0:02:33.500,0:02:42.660
2 Corinthians 11. You take your reading from verse 23 to 29.

0:02:42.660,0:02:44.820
Are you there?

0:02:44.820,0:02:52.740
And also the book of Matthew 10. Take your reading from 19 to 20.

0:02:52.740,0:02:57.880
That will also help in your reading.

0:02:57.880,0:03:09.480
1 Thessalonians 5. Take your reading from verse 1 to 10.

0:03:09.480,0:03:13.000
That will also help.

0:03:13.000,0:03:16.680
'The Secret Of True Believers' - your secret.

0:03:16.680,0:03:20.980
Of which you don't know that it is your secret. It is your weapon.

0:03:20.980,0:03:24.340
Why is it your weapon? - We talk about it today.

0:03:24.340,0:03:27.460
Hallelujah.

0:03:27.460,0:03:37.020
James 1:1: "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,

0:03:37.020,0:03:44.400
to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings."

0:03:44.400,0:03:49.680
Trial and temptation - this is all we are hearing today.

0:03:49.680,0:03:52.000
Trial and temptation.

0:03:52.000,0:03:54.980
James 1:2: "Consider it pure joy..."

0:03:54.980,0:04:05.800
But today, we consider it as sorrow, crisis, pain.

0:04:05.800,0:04:11.320
But the Bible here says, "Consider it pure joy..."

0:04:11.320,0:04:14.280
Can you consider trial as pure joy?

0:04:14.280,0:04:16.420
Insult - pure joy?

0:04:16.420,0:04:18.800
Persecution - pure joy?

0:04:18.800,0:04:20.500
Opposition - pure joy?

0:04:20.500,0:04:22.900
This is what the Bible is saying here.

0:04:22.900,0:04:34.680
James 1:2: "...my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds"

0:04:34.680,0:04:46.340
Poverty, hardship, sickness, disease, stagnation could be your trial.

0:04:46.340,0:04:48.340
Okay?

0:04:48.340,0:04:55.380
James 1:3: "because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance."

0:04:55.380,0:05:06.000
James 1:4: "Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."

0:05:06.000,0:05:11.340
Take your time and read from that verse 4 down.

0:05:11.340,0:05:17.140
I have given you those books that will give this message today.

0:05:17.140,0:05:21.060
Lord Jesus, we thank You.

0:05:21.060,0:05:24.460
Let Your Word in our hearts.

0:05:24.460,0:05:31.540
You should be ready right now, the prayer point given to you the last two to three sundays.

0:05:31.540,0:05:43.080
Lord, release my spirit to follow You; I have surrendered.

0:05:43.080,0:05:51.520
Say to yourself, "Release my spirit, Lord, to follow You; I have surrendered".

0:05:51.520,0:05:55.740
Your heart is very important.

0:05:55.740,0:06:06.640
Your heart must be at its best for God.

0:06:06.640,0:06:13.820
Your heart cannot be at its best without being spiritual.

0:06:13.820,0:06:21.480
Your heart must be at its best because the Spirit expresses itself through the heart.

0:06:21.480,0:06:23.480
Tell your neighbour.

0:06:23.480,0:06:30.540
The Spirit of God expresses itself through my heart.

0:06:30.540,0:06:31.820
I can't hear you.

0:06:31.820,0:06:35.600
[The Spirit of God expresses itself through my heart.]

0:06:35.600,0:06:36.960
I can't hear you.

0:06:36.960,0:06:40.460
[The Spirit of God expresses itself through my heart.]

0:06:40.460,0:06:46.240
Yes, the Spirit of God expresses itself through your heart.

0:06:46.240,0:06:54.760
That is why you must have freedom of your heart, a free heart - liberation.

0:06:54.760,0:07:01.620
You need it because the Spirit expresses itself through your heart.

0:07:01.620,0:07:03.020
Can you see the connection of your heart?

0:07:03.020,0:07:08.580
Your heart is His prayer room, strong room.

0:07:08.580,0:07:11.700
Why is it secret? - It is your secret.

0:07:11.700,0:07:18.440
Couldn't you hear? - Let your trial be a joy.

0:07:18.440,0:07:20.440
Hallelujah.

0:07:20.440,0:07:54.400
In life, we do have days, weeks, months and years that come with enormous challenges -

0:07:54.400,0:08:08.720
poverty, hatred, persecution, insults and so on and so forth.

0:08:08.720,0:08:17.540
What do we do as Christians when they come?

0:08:17.540,0:08:26.300
Believers may have challenges but our challenges are not like others.

0:08:26.300,0:08:33.460
As a believer, you may have challenges.

0:08:33.460,0:08:39.000
You know what I mean by 'challenges' - they could be sickness, poverty, could be this or that.

0:08:39.000,0:08:44.040
Our challenges are not like others.

0:08:44.040,0:08:47.920
They are to strengthen our desire and determination for God,

0:08:47.920,0:08:50.720
to improve us, not impair us.

0:08:50.720,0:08:56.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:56.900,0:09:08.060
What do we do as Christians when they come?

0:09:08.060,0:09:13.580
The Bible says, "Watch and pray".

0:09:13.580,0:09:16.540
In one of the verses I gave you.

0:09:16.540,0:09:20.300
"Watch and pray."

0:09:20.300,0:09:22.680
How can you watch and pray?

0:09:22.680,0:09:30.100
It means you must discipline your heart before prayer.

0:09:30.100,0:09:36.500
You cannot watch for God without a disciplined heart.

0:09:36.500,0:09:47.540
'Watch and pray' means you must discipline your heart before prayer.

0:09:47.540,0:09:53.480
How do we discipline our heart?

0:09:53.480,0:10:01.740
Something that does not qualify for meditation does not qualify for conversation.

0:10:01.740,0:10:03.840
I'm telling you the process.

0:10:03.840,0:10:09.680
What are you meditating?

0:10:09.680,0:10:22.420
What does not qualify for your heart does not qualify for your mouth.

0:10:22.420,0:10:24.120
Are you with me?

0:10:24.120,0:10:25.100
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:25.100,0:10:36.060
What does not qualify for meditation does not qualify for conversation -

0:10:36.060,0:10:41.920
means, speak what you believe, say what you believe.

0:10:41.920,0:10:48.640
If I say, "Stand up for prayer!", if you don't believe, don't stand up.

0:10:48.640,0:10:57.980
If I say, "Sit down!", if you don't believe, stand!

0:10:57.980,0:11:04.060
But today, when I say, "Stand up!" - "Hm, man of God said, 'Stand up!'." You will stand up.

0:11:04.060,0:11:09.640
When I say, "Let us pray!" - you don't believe, yet you pray.

0:11:09.640,0:11:16.240
"In the name of Jesus!" - you don't believe and say, "Amen!"

0:11:16.240,0:11:22.040
"In Jesus' name!" - you don't believe what I'm saying and you say, "Amen!"

0:11:22.040,0:11:31.500
The whole thing has now become a national anthem.

0:11:31.500,0:11:41.320
Faith is not a hobby. We take our faith as a hobby.

0:11:41.320,0:11:47.460
There is no alternative for our faith.

0:11:47.460,0:11:53.580
How can we discipline our heart?

0:11:53.580,0:12:00.700
We submit to panic and you say you are a Christian.

0:12:00.700,0:12:09.220
When I say, "Hey, there is a lion somewhere there!", you say, "Where?"

0:12:09.220,0:12:11.380
That is the question you ask me - "Where?"

0:12:11.380,0:12:13.500
And I say, "There!"

0:12:13.500,0:12:23.440
Mere hearing the roaring - "Where is my bag?"

0:12:23.440,0:12:26.820
From that moment, you will not close your eyes for prayer again.

0:12:26.820,0:12:30.640
If I say, "Let us pray!", you say, "No, I cannot!"

0:12:30.640,0:12:33.540
Because a lion is around, you have to...

0:12:33.540,0:12:36.280
"In Jesus' name. Amen."

0:12:36.280,0:12:41.180
If the lion comes close, you say, "T.B. Joshua, the prayer has not sent the lion away.

0:12:41.180,0:12:42.920
It is still very close".

0:12:42.920,0:12:52.920
If the lion now kicks the door, you will abandon me here.

0:12:52.920,0:12:58.240
We should be still and not submit to panic.

0:12:58.240,0:13:00.000
Okay.

0:13:00.000,0:13:03.240
"Let us pray."

0:13:03.240,0:13:08.220
"Rise up and let us pray."

0:13:08.220,0:13:10.920
Can you see?

0:13:10.920,0:13:15.880
My brother is looking at the other brother, "When will you stand up?"

0:13:15.880,0:13:21.040
We believe in majority instead of God's authority.

0:13:21.040,0:13:27.380
"Let us stand up for prayer."

0:13:27.380,0:13:30.200
Okay, good!

0:13:30.200,0:13:33.440
Sit down.

0:13:33.440,0:13:37.240
By what authority are you doing this?

0:13:37.240,0:13:40.620
Authority that I put on suit!

0:13:40.620,0:13:43.340
Authority that I'm standing in front of you!

0:13:43.340,0:13:46.100
"Let us respect this man and stand up."

0:13:46.100,0:13:47.520
That is it.

0:13:47.520,0:13:52.120
If not, you don't believe what to say.

0:13:52.120,0:13:58.660
We should be still and not submit to panic.

0:13:58.660,0:14:03.040
That is our problem.

0:14:03.040,0:14:07.020
When you have a little pain in your heart - "Ey."

0:14:07.020,0:14:08.440
"What happened?"

0:14:08.440,0:14:10.860
"Ah, the thing has started."

0:14:10.860,0:14:14.780
"What started?"

0:14:14.780,0:14:17.960
And begin to do the right thing.

0:14:17.960,0:14:23.860
It is when you are still and not panicked that you can begin to do the right thing.

0:14:23.860,0:14:28.820
You don't do the right thing in a panic moment.

0:14:28.820,0:14:35.940
We should take control of our situation instead of being afraid.

0:14:35.940,0:14:41.160
Take control instead of being what? - Afraid.

0:14:41.160,0:14:44.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:44.100,0:15:02.160
Sometimes discouraged but not defeated
Cast down but not destroyed

0:15:02.160,0:15:18.360
There are times I don‘t understand
But I believe it‘s turning around for me

0:15:18.360,0:15:35.280
I’ve had struggles and disappointments
There are times I felt so alone

0:15:35.280,0:15:52.000
Some of my friends they let me down
But I still believe it’s turning around for me

0:15:52.000,0:16:26.460
Around for me around for me
Around for me it’t turning around for me

0:16:26.460,0:16:37.580
I can see the breaking of day
God is making a way

0:16:37.580,0:16:46.040
A change is coming for me
If I stand strong and believe

0:16:46.040,0:16:55.440
There's no reason to doubt
I know He's working it out

0:16:55.440,0:17:03.000
It's turning around for me

0:17:03.000,0:17:18.720
And it won't always be like this
The Lord will perfect that concerning me

0:17:18.720,0:17:51.920
And sooner or later it will turn in my favour
It's turning around for me

0:17:51.920,0:17:58.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:58.980,0:18:00.720
Did you listen to that?

0:18:00.720,0:18:04.040
That song hit you.

0:18:04.040,0:18:05.420
It hit you.

0:18:05.420,0:18:12.840
You must take control of your situation instead of being afraid

0:18:12.840,0:18:26.740
because satan himself, the cause of crises and challenges, has been defeated.

0:18:26.740,0:18:29.660
Yes, that is what you should know.

0:18:29.660,0:18:33.040
The cause of those challenges you are facing -

0:18:33.040,0:18:44.440
poverty, sickness, disease, affliction, stagnation, temptation, persecution, opposition -

0:18:44.440,0:18:55.720
the cause, satan, has been defeated.

0:18:55.720,0:19:09.140
When adversity comes, as a true believer, welcome it.

0:19:09.140,0:19:19.820
True believers greet adversity as a friend, greet challenges as friends.

0:19:19.820,0:19:25.140
Whatever it is, greet as a friend.

0:19:25.140,0:19:32.220
That you are a believer, you may have affliction, challenges

0:19:32.220,0:19:41.380
but your challenges are not like others.

0:19:41.380,0:19:47.940
We must learn that there is value in the challenges.

0:19:47.940,0:19:56.160
The situation that looks impossible - there is value.

0:19:56.160,0:19:59.000
There can be no promotion without examination.

0:19:59.000,0:20:07.480
There is value in the situation that looks impossible.

0:20:07.480,0:20:17.080
That is why people like me can be here today.

0:20:17.080,0:20:40.000
True believers must have determination not to listen to the panic of the moment

0:20:40.000,0:20:50.320
but to find the quiet voice of counsel.

0:20:50.320,0:21:02.180
Pause and listen to what the Holy Spirit has to say concerning the matter.

0:21:02.180,0:21:09.200
That sickness may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for a new level in life.

0:21:09.200,0:21:24.600
That stagnation may be to reprepare you, to redirect you, to improve you.

0:21:24.600,0:21:29.020
It's a transit point to connect you.

0:21:29.020,0:21:32.300
Transit point - when you are going country to country,

0:21:32.300,0:21:35.840
there is a place where you have to stop to connect your flight.

0:21:35.840,0:21:44.000
That is the challenges to connect you to the future you desire.

0:21:44.000,0:21:47.740
Transit what? - Transit point.

0:21:47.740,0:21:53.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:53.340,0:22:09.540
When we listen to the Holy Spirit, He will protect us from the pitfalls of every enemy.

0:22:09.540,0:22:17.720
Continuously praying in the spirit and listening to His voice

0:22:17.720,0:22:25.160
will protect you from your daily challenges.

0:22:25.160,0:22:42.220
I know a place I can always run to
In times of distress, confusion and fear

0:22:42.220,0:22:51.220
But when my enemy surrounds me
Father I know I'm free

0:22:51.220,0:23:01.660
For You keep me and guide me
In the shadow of Your wings

0:23:01.660,0:23:19.020
In the shadow of Your wings I know I am safe
In the shadow of Your wings I find relief

0:23:19.020,0:23:26.920
For You will hold me and You'll guide me
With Your righteous hand

0:23:26.920,0:23:38.860
I find rest, peace of mind
In the shadow of Your wings

0:23:38.860,0:23:55.640
In the shadow of Your wings I know I am safe
In the shadow of Your wings I find relief

0:23:55.640,0:24:03.160
For You will hold me and You'll guide me
With Your righteous hand

0:24:03.160,0:24:15.340
I find rest, peace of mind
In the shadow of Your wings

0:24:15.340,0:24:49.220
I am safe in the shadow of Your wings

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:52.120,0:24:55.160
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:24:55.160,0:24:57.860
Did you listen to that?

0:24:57.860,0:25:20.840
In our daily challenges, you need to find enough calm to think clearly and react diligently

0:25:20.840,0:25:23.920
and not submit to panic.

0:25:23.920,0:25:28.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:28.880,0:25:41.240
The challenges we are facing is just this: Our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.

0:25:41.240,0:25:49.380
When our heart is not in one accord with our mouth, whom are we talking to?

0:25:49.380,0:25:59.020
It is when our heart is in one accord with our mouth, then, we can bring Jesus on the scene.

0:25:59.020,0:26:05.180
Then, we can bring the Holy Spirit, Spirit of the Father into our hearts.

0:26:05.180,0:26:10.160
When we say, "Jesus!", our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.

0:26:10.160,0:26:13.920
"Amen!" - our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.

0:26:13.920,0:26:18.220
"Hallelujah!" - our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.

0:26:18.220,0:26:21.880
So, can you see? All what we are doing?

0:26:21.880,0:26:30.620
Ask your neighbour, "Did you pray for the situation you are in today?

0:26:30.620,0:26:34.200
Did you?

0:26:34.200,0:26:41.020
Did you confess the situation you are in today?"

0:26:41.020,0:26:47.820
It is what we have been saying, what you have been saying in the name of Jesus

0:26:47.820,0:26:53.220
is not such in heart.

0:26:53.220,0:26:56.500
What you have been saying in the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus,

0:26:56.500,0:27:07.420
"Amen", every day, is not such in heart.

0:27:07.420,0:27:09.060
So, this is what I mean.

0:27:09.060,0:27:17.060
Our heart is not in one accord with our mouth when it comes to God's Word.

0:27:17.060,0:27:20.220
Speak in the name of Jesus! Shout in the name of Jesus!

0:27:20.220,0:27:29.280
Our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.

0:27:29.280,0:27:33.500
Did you pray for this situation you are facing today?

0:27:33.500,0:27:48.940
This means, what you have been saying - "In the name of Jesus!" - is not such in heart.

0:27:48.940,0:27:53.980
No! It is not such in heart!

0:27:53.980,0:27:56.880
"In the name of Jesus! Father, bless me!

0:27:56.880,0:27:59.620
Father, give me this! Father, give me that!"

0:27:59.620,0:28:07.820
What you are saying is different from what is in your heart.

0:28:07.820,0:28:10.600
We begin to bring Jesus on the scene

0:28:10.600,0:28:14.300
or bring the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Father into our heart,

0:28:14.300,0:28:26.300
when what we are saying is in one accord with our heart.

0:28:26.300,0:28:28.860
Like I have said:

0:28:28.860,0:28:46.720
As I look at true believers, I do not forget the many insults, persecutions, hatred,

0:28:46.720,0:28:54.620
temptation, opposition they endure to maintain their Christian life.

0:28:54.620,0:28:56.820
I salute them.

0:28:56.820,0:29:05.300
We are soldiers in the army
We have to fight or we have to die

0:29:05.300,0:29:13.060
We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
We've got to hold it up until we die

0:29:13.060,0:29:21.380
We are soldiers in the army
We have to fight or we have to die

0:29:21.380,0:29:28.980
We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
We've got to hold it up until we die

0:29:28.980,0:29:37.260
We are soldiers in the army
We have to fight or we have to die

0:29:37.260,0:29:45.960
We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
We've got to hold it up until we die

0:29:45.960,0:29:54.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:54.360,0:29:59.960
All the soldiers in the house, let me see your hands up!

0:29:59.960,0:30:02.580
One more time!

0:30:02.580,0:30:10.860
We are soldiers in the army
We have to fight or we have to die

0:30:10.860,0:30:17.580
We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
We've got to hold it up until we die

0:30:17.580,0:30:18.480
Let me hear you say:

0:30:18.480,0:30:26.640
We are soldiers in the army
We have to fight or we have to die

0:30:26.640,0:30:34.180
We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
We've got to hold it up until we die

0:30:34.180,0:30:37.740
The Church is marching on

0:30:37.740,0:30:45.600
The Church is marching on
The gates of hell shall not prevail

0:30:45.600,0:30:53.460
The Church is marching on

0:30:53.460,0:31:01.340
The Church is marching on
The gates of hell shall not prevail

0:31:01.340,0:31:05.760
The Church is marching on

0:31:05.760,0:31:13.920
We are soldiers in the army
We have to fight or we have to die

0:31:13.920,0:31:28.340
We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
We've got to hold it up until we die

0:31:28.340,0:31:32.980
You may be seated. Did you listen to that?

0:31:32.980,0:31:52.420
As I look at true believers, I do not forget the many insults, persecutions, hatred,

0:31:52.420,0:32:00.280
temptation, opposition they endure to maintain their Christian life,

0:32:00.280,0:32:02.380
to walk with the Lord.

0:32:02.380,0:32:07.800
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:32:07.800,0:32:14.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:14.360,0:32:19.400
These challenges force us to look deeper.

0:32:19.400,0:32:26.400
Tell your neighbour, "These challenges force us to look deeper".

0:32:26.400,0:32:33.200
Tell your neighbour what he does not want to hear and see what will happen.

0:32:33.200,0:32:41.640
Okay. Say to your neighbour, "Your mouth is smelly".

0:32:41.640,0:32:56.680
These challenges force us to look deeper, explore possibilities,

0:32:56.680,0:33:01.600
increase our desire and determination for God,

0:33:01.600,0:33:12.900
pray and dream of other ways that might have been ignored.

0:33:12.900,0:33:17.560
Can you see the value in crises, challenges?

0:33:17.560,0:33:23.600
Just say to your neighbour, "Hey! Please, you are smelly!" and see what your neighbour will say.

0:33:23.600,0:33:29.600
By what he is saying, it will tell you, you will know that he is not a Christian.

0:33:29.600,0:33:31.780
But now he is a Christian.

0:33:31.780,0:33:34.700
Tell your neighbour, "Now, you are a Christian.

0:33:34.700,0:33:41.820
Let challenges come and see whether you are a Christian".

0:33:41.820,0:33:47.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:47.540,0:33:52.240
These challenges force us to look deeper.

0:33:52.240,0:33:55.420
Tomorrow, just look for your best friend.

0:33:55.420,0:33:57.280
Give him a test.

0:33:57.280,0:34:02.140
Just come and say, "Ha, I never knew you were a thief".

0:34:02.140,0:34:10.120
"I'm a thief? I'm taking you to the court!"

0:34:10.120,0:34:13.880
"My brother, come! It is not like that!"

0:34:13.880,0:34:17.220
Challenges force us to look deeper.

0:34:17.220,0:34:20.140
"I never knew you were not my friend."

0:34:20.140,0:34:27.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:27.680,0:34:39.160
Without being tested, as a Christian, our genuineness cannot be determined.

0:34:39.160,0:34:45.800
Tell your neighbour, "Your genuineness cannot be determined without being tested".

0:34:45.800,0:34:47.840
Test by what?

0:34:47.840,0:34:50.020
By joy?

0:34:50.020,0:34:52.080
By food?

0:34:52.080,0:34:53.900
By blessing?

0:34:53.900,0:34:57.960
By breakthrough? What is that test?

0:34:57.960,0:35:17.600
Tell your neighour, "Without being tested, as a true believer, your genuineness cannot be determined.

0:35:17.600,0:35:22.420
You are not here today because of miracles you have seen so far.

0:35:22.420,0:35:27.420
You are not here today because of prophecies God is using me to perform.

0:35:27.420,0:35:32.540
No! You are not here because of crusades all over the world.

0:35:32.540,0:35:35.320
You are here because after sitting down,

0:35:35.320,0:35:39.080
"Ah, what this man has gone through - he is a man of God!"

0:35:39.080,0:35:49.720
No human being has gone through that and succeeded.

0:35:49.720,0:35:51.200
Did you listen to me?

0:35:51.200,0:35:53.620
You are not here because of the miracles.

0:35:53.620,0:35:59.540
You are not here because of prophecies or what you have seen on Emmanuel TV so far.

0:35:59.540,0:36:02.660
You are here because after sitting down and saying,

0:36:02.660,0:36:07.280
"Ha, he is not a human being! The man is a spirit!"

0:36:07.280,0:36:15.380

Without being tested, as a Christian, your genuineness cannot be determined.

0:36:31.580,0:36:43.220
As a believer, we must understand that when times are stable

0:36:43.220,0:36:52.120
and the sea is calm and secure, no one is really tested.

0:36:52.120,0:37:08.120
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm

0:37:08.120,0:37:25.260
Father You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

0:37:25.260,0:37:41.820
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm

0:37:41.820,0:38:00.100
Father You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

0:38:00.100,0:38:31.260
Hide me now under Your wings
Cover me within Your mighty hand

0:38:31.260,0:38:47.340
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm

0:38:47.340,0:39:03.800
Father You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

0:39:03.800,0:39:19.780
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm

0:39:19.780,0:39:40.680
Father You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

0:39:40.680,0:39:42.680
You may be seated.

0:39:42.680,0:39:44.500
Yes.

0:39:44.500,0:39:54.540
We must understand that when times are stable

0:39:54.540,0:40:06.360
and the sea is calm and secure, no one is really tested.

0:40:06.360,0:40:10.100
Many abandon their faith because of challenges.

0:40:10.100,0:40:12.660
Many are running helter skelter.

0:40:12.660,0:40:17.540
The devil gets people to his side because of trouble.

0:40:17.540,0:40:20.440
When the trouble comes, the devil will say to you, "Can you see?

0:40:20.440,0:40:22.580
You say you are serving God. Can you see?

0:40:22.580,0:40:24.620
Where is your God?

0:40:24.620,0:40:28.340
God of crises? God of challenges?

0:40:28.340,0:40:31.380
God of tribulation? God of stagnation?

0:40:31.380,0:40:37.240
God of joblessness? Where is that God?"

0:40:37.240,0:40:48.100
In contrast, poverty, hardship, sickness, disease, stagnation, just name them

0:40:48.100,0:41:03.900
force us to come face to face with who we really are and what we can become.

0:41:03.900,0:41:18.940
Tell your neighbour, "Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier".

0:41:18.940,0:41:20.160
I can't hear you.

0:41:20.160,0:41:24.180
[Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.]

0:41:24.180,0:41:34.720
Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.

0:41:34.720,0:41:43.420
What do I mean? Match your actions with your words if you want to succeed in life.

0:41:43.420,0:42:41.600
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

0:42:41.600,0:42:55.480
You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song

0:42:55.480,0:43:09.100
Of deliverance from my enemies'
'Til all my fears are gone

0:43:09.100,0:43:37.300
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

0:43:37.300,0:43:40.180
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:43:40.180,0:43:44.180
Hallelujah.

0:43:44.180,0:43:54.920
Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.

0:43:54.920,0:44:01.200
I mean, match your action with your word.

0:44:01.200,0:44:04.660
Your action is different from your word.

0:44:04.660,0:44:09.740
The action is heart; the word is mouth.

0:44:09.740,0:44:16.000
Your heart is different from your mouth; that is why your life is like this.

0:44:16.000,0:44:21.940
You find yourself in the situation you are in today because your heart is different from your mouth.

0:44:21.940,0:44:24.320
Match your action with your word.

0:44:24.320,0:44:25.680
Tell your neighbour.

0:44:25.680,0:44:29.640
[Match your action with your word.]

0:44:29.640,0:44:35.660
"In Jesus' name", "Jesus is this", "Jesus is that" - are you what you are saying?

0:44:35.660,0:44:42.480
"Amen!" - do you mean it?

0:44:42.480,0:44:49.420
"Amen! In Jesus' name, be healed!" - do you mean what you are saying?

0:44:49.420,0:44:52.580
Match your actions with your words.

0:44:52.580,0:45:02.460
Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.

0:45:02.460,0:45:05.760
Viewers, thank you for your time.

0:45:05.760,0:45:10.300
Now, you know your position when it comes to challenges.

0:45:10.300,0:45:13.800
You know your position when it comes to temptation.

0:45:13.800,0:45:18.180
You now know your position as a Christian when it comes to tribulation.

0:45:18.180,0:45:21.760
Now, you know your position when it comes to stagnation.

0:45:21.760,0:45:25.000
You know your position when it comes to temptation.

0:45:25.000,0:45:27.500
Here you are.

0:45:27.500,0:45:33.220
Temptation and challenges are your friends.

0:45:33.220,0:45:37.840
It is time now you begin to see the value in the challenges.

0:45:37.840,0:45:42.440
See the value in the situation that looks impossible.

0:45:42.440,0:45:45.340
There is value there.

0:45:45.340,0:45:47.920
I'm a good example.

0:45:47.920,0:45:49.400
Here I am.

Those of you who were crying for me in the past, now you can see.

0:46:01.940,0:46:03.680
Cry no more!

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:06.800,0:46:14.220
You never knew my situation didn't demand for crying.

0:46:14.220,0:46:17.700
Your sickness is to force you to look deeper.

0:46:17.700,0:46:20.760
Look deeper when sickness comes.

0:46:20.760,0:46:23.860
When hardship comes, look deeper.

0:46:23.860,0:46:27.740
Whatever you are facing, look deeper.

0:46:27.740,0:46:32.660
It is time to explore possibilities.

0:46:32.660,0:46:36.780
It will increase our desire and determination for God.

0:46:36.780,0:46:45.740
Pray and dream of other ways that might have been ignored.

0:46:45.740,0:46:49.200
I bless you. Thank you.
