0:00:00.840,0:00:04.900
Can I talk to you, brother?

0:00:04.900,0:00:07.800
Where is your mum?

0:00:07.800,0:00:09.580
Take care of your mum.

0:00:09.580,0:00:10.200
Okay?

0:00:10.200,0:00:10.960
Okay.

0:00:10.960,0:00:13.100
Take care of your mum.

0:00:13.100,0:00:14.040
Thank you, sir.

0:00:14.040,0:00:15.780
Your mum is a good woman.

0:00:15.780,0:00:16.500
Thank you, sir.

0:00:16.500,0:00:20.020
I don't know why they call her all (kind of) names.

0:00:20.020,0:00:22.860
They called her a witch. There is nothing they have not called this woman.

0:00:22.860,0:00:24.140
Yes, sir.

0:00:24.140,0:00:25.320
Thank You, Jesus!

0:00:25.320,0:00:27.880
Why do you people believe this woman is a witch?

0:00:27.880,0:00:32.120
That is what the people are calling her.

0:00:32.120,0:00:35.940
Even my dad's family, all of them call her a witch.

0:00:35.940,0:00:40.540
That is my family on my father's side called my mother a witch.

0:00:40.540,0:00:47.740
This is the problem you people have, calling an innocent person - 'a nature of God' -

0:00:47.740,0:00:49.600
someone who is not a witch witch.

0:00:49.600,0:00:52.760
This woman has cried and cried.

0:00:52.760,0:00:54.320
Exactly, sir.

0:00:54.320,0:00:59.720
None of you will prosper unless this woman accepts sorry

0:00:59.720,0:01:03.460
and the Spirit of God forgives you.

0:01:03.460,0:01:05.780
This woman suffered.

0:01:05.780,0:01:08.040
You are going to bring this woman.

0:01:08.040,0:01:09.620
Okay? Go and wait for me.

0:01:09.620,0:01:10.680
Thank you, sir.

0:01:11.220,0:01:12.560
It will not only be you.

0:01:12.560,0:01:16.660
We will beg mama with the Spirit of God and she will accept.

0:01:16.660,0:01:18.660
All of the family will be delivered.

0:01:18.660,0:01:22.960
They have cursed this woman.

0:01:22.960,0:01:26.300
Because of that, she is living at the backyard of the house.

0:01:26.300,0:01:27.240
Yes, sir.

0:01:28.200,0:01:33.680
My name is Charles Benson.

0:01:33.680,0:01:35.320
I'm from Delta State.

0:01:35.320,0:01:45.140
The woman standing beside me is my mother whom we called a witch.

0:01:45.140,0:01:49.480
These people behind me are my brothers and sisters.

0:01:49.480,0:01:56.620
This other mama here is my mother-in-law.

0:01:56.620,0:02:02.720
Last Sunday, when we were in the first service, the man of God called me.

0:02:02.720,0:02:05.300
He asked me where my mother was.

0:02:05.300,0:02:08.060
I said that my mother was at home.

0:02:08.060,0:02:12.020
He then said that I should take care of her.

0:02:12.020,0:02:13.900
I said, "Okay, sir".

0:02:13.900,0:02:16.740
After that, he prophesied to me.

0:02:16.740,0:02:19.520
He asked, "Why do they call your mother all sorts of names?"

0:02:19.520,0:02:25.800
"They call her a witch. She is not a witch; she is innocent."

0:02:25.800,0:02:28.100
He said that even I called her a witch.

0:02:28.100,0:02:31.980
He said that because of that, she cried.

0:02:31.980,0:02:36.900
Because of her crying, there is no breakthrough in the family.

0:02:36.900,0:02:40.420
So, he said I should bring her here.

0:02:40.420,0:02:44.100
That is why I brought her here with my family.

0:02:44.100,0:02:47.180
What the man of God said is true.

0:02:47.180,0:02:51.060
We called her a witch and put her at the backyard.

0:02:51.060,0:02:54.460
My name is Fatima.

0:02:54.460,0:03:01.920
When my husband died, the family called me to their meeting.

0:03:01.920,0:03:05.020
They asked me what happened.

0:03:05.020,0:03:09.340
I told them that I didn't know what killed their brother.

0:03:09.340,0:03:13.620
They said that I was the one that killed my husband.

0:03:13.620,0:03:16.480
I said that I didn't know anything concerning that,

0:03:16.480,0:03:18.480
that he was sick.

0:03:18.480,0:03:21.540
After we came from the village,

0:03:21.540,0:03:25.080
the house that my children, my husband and I were staying in,

0:03:25.080,0:03:29.120
my husband's family drove me out.

0:03:29.120,0:03:34.580
I begged that they should let me and my children stay.

0:03:34.580,0:03:38.760
They said that they had already shared the house and given it to someone else.

0:03:38.760,0:03:43.200
They threw my property outside and drove me away.

0:03:43.200,0:03:47.400
I had nowhere to stay and even to eat was difficult.

0:03:47.400,0:03:52.600
This mama saw me suffering when all my property was outside.

0:03:52.600,0:03:56.880
She met me and said she couldn't leave me like that.

0:03:56.880,0:04:02.140
She took some of the property and took it to the backyard where she used to work.

0:04:02.140,0:04:06.460
It was a backyard, outside.

0:04:06.460,0:04:10.180
They gave me money to live and cook.

0:04:10.180,0:04:13.640
We quite understand what has happened to you - the pain.

0:04:13.640,0:04:16.140
That was why we invited you here today

0:04:16.140,0:04:18.760
to let the world know that you are not a witch

0:04:18.760,0:04:23.160
and that we are very sorry for what happened.

0:04:23.160,0:04:27.480
This is a glorious day for every one of us.

0:04:27.480,0:04:32.360
We are very sorry; mama is not a witch.

0:04:32.360,0:04:38.380
Son, please be on your knee and hug your mum.

0:04:48.580,0:04:53.040
So, please, mama, pray for them.

0:04:53.040,0:04:55.400
Mama is praying for them.

0:04:55.400,0:05:05.100
So, please, as you are offering this prayer, the Lord Almighty is praying for them as well.

0:05:05.100,0:05:06.780
They are looking for breakthrough

0:05:06.780,0:05:11.680
and they don't know the sin they have committed, ignorantly.

0:05:11.680,0:05:14.280
Now, mama has forgiven them.

0:05:14.280,0:05:16.560
Mama, you should forgive everyone.

0:05:16.560,0:05:19.080
All these are my husband's family.

0:05:19.080,0:05:21.980
The last son threw my things away.

0:05:21.980,0:05:23.980
So, you threw away mama's things?

0:05:23.980,0:05:25.860
It was due to permission from the home, sir.

0:05:25.860,0:05:28.500
He needs prayer.

0:05:28.500,0:05:31.440
He needs prayer because he didn't know what he was doing.

0:05:31.440,0:05:33.440
He threw all my property away.

0:05:33.440,0:05:34.800
He is the one that threw your property away?

0:05:34.800,0:05:35.580
Yes.

0:05:35.580,0:05:38.600
That was the order from the home.

0:05:38.600,0:05:40.880
That was why mama said you need prayer.

0:05:40.880,0:05:43.500
Mama knows that you acted ignorantly.

0:06:10.020,0:06:12.220
She said that they drove this woman outside.

0:06:12.220,0:06:13.400
She was the one taking care of her.

0:06:13.400,0:06:15.740
Nobody from the family asked about her or the children,

0:06:15.740,0:06:18.020
how they were feeding and how they were doing.

0:06:18.020,0:06:20.740
So, it is over now. We thank God.

0:06:20.740,0:06:23.620
God is the one who gave us this revelation

0:06:23.620,0:06:27.480
and the same God is saying, "It is over".

0:06:27.480,0:06:34.600
Man of God, I forgive all the people who made me suffer.

0:06:34.600,0:06:50.600
Family Reconciled in Jesus' Name

0:06:50.600,0:06:56.640
