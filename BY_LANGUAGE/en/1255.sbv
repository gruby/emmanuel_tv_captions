The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:27.120,0:00:31.840
You know; There is no way our faith can be lifted up without repentance.

0:00:31.840,0:00:34.120
You know that?

0:00:34.120,0:00:41.800
You know the Bible says that sin is never covered by our appearance.

0:00:41.800,0:00:44.740
This is what we believe today.

0:00:44.740,0:00:49.020
Sin is never covered by our appearance

0:00:49.020,0:00:51.600
Tell your neighbour.

0:00:51.600,0:00:53.780
Sin is never covered by our appearance

0:00:53.780,0:00:57.700
Wrong is never  covered by our prayer.

0:00:57.700,0:01:01.080
Prayer without repentance; we are talking to the air.

0:01:01.080,0:01:06.780
You just making noise.

0:01:06.780,0:01:08.500
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:08.500,0:01:18.680
Our wrong, our sin, our mistake is never covered by our prayer.

0:01:18.680,0:01:33.420
I mean; Prayer without repentance is never covered by our tears.

0:01:33.420,0:01:39.600
Sin can only be removed by repentance.

0:01:39.600,0:01:43.180
Wrong can only be removed by repentance.

0:01:43.180,0:01:46.960
And what is repentance? Simple.

0:01:46.960,0:01:52.240
You begin to step into repentance when you stop blaming others.

0:01:52.240,0:01:54.740
you are stepping into what? (Repentance)

0:01:54.740,0:02:00.440
Your business is not good; you say oh it's witch craft. That is how it happened to our family

0:02:00.440,0:02:03.720
my brother is not making it. my sister is not making it.

0:02:03.720,0:02:08.640
But when you are making it, when business is good, you say it's my hard working.

0:02:08.640,0:02:12.220
I am a graduate, I am a professor

0:02:12.220,0:02:15.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:15.260,0:02:19.960
When the going are good, and you are making it; business is flourishing

0:02:19.960,0:02:28.600
You say, oh my God I wake up in the morning , I click to my business. You know what I am talking about.

0:02:28.600,0:02:35.620
But when business is bad; you begin to look for witches.

0:02:35.620,0:02:38.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:38.240,0:02:42.580

Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.

0:02:57.780,0:02:59.780
I can't hear you.

0:02:59.780,0:03:01.780
Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.

0:03:01.780,0:03:06.700
When it happens to you say yes, reproach

0:03:06.700,0:03:08.700

0:03:08.700,0:03:11.940
Who is going through the pain. is it witch craft?

0:03:11.940,0:03:19.860
What you are going through, who is going through it; is it wizard? It's you that is going through the pain.

0:03:19.860,0:03:29.900
Tell your neighbour; repentance comes when you stop blaming others.

0:03:29.900,0:03:34.680
You might have been in marriage for many years, no issue, have been barren

0:03:34.680,0:03:41.200

Sin can only be removed by repentance.

0:04:12.060,0:04:23.340

Are you with me? God often uses circumstances of life .
