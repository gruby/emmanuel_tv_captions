0:00:00.000,0:00:02.580
Thank You, Lord!

0:00:02.580,0:00:06.480
I hope you are thanking Jesus in your hearts.

0:00:06.480,0:00:14.080
Nowadays, we have substitutes - 
belief for action - which is wrong.

0:00:14.080,0:00:23.300
When we see people saying, "I believe in healing. 
I believe in salvation. I believe in this, that..." -

0:00:23.300,0:00:31.120
It is not enough to believe in healing.

0:00:31.120,0:00:39.340
It is not enough to just believe in healing, 
or whatever you are seeking.

0:00:39.340,0:00:46.200
It is something we must reach out, in faith.

0:00:46.200,0:00:49.180
That is why many times we get disappointed.

0:00:49.180,0:00:52.220
"I believe, I believe..."

0:00:52.220,0:01:00.240
Many of you are here because you believe 
but you must reach out in faith.

0:01:00.240,0:01:07.560
That is, we must speak our faith and act our faith.

0:01:07.560,0:01:11.180
Not just speak, "Yes..."

0:01:11.180,0:01:14.660
It must be from your heart.

0:01:14.660,0:01:19.160
If you want to demonstrate that 'Yes', 
it must also be from your heart.

0:01:19.160,0:01:27.340
I should not just come out because I believe; 
I must come out because I have faith.

0:01:27.340,0:01:36.620
If you say you believe, Jesus will work for you
 – belief in our heart is released by faith -

0:01:36.620,0:01:38.820
how will that belief be released?

0:01:38.820,0:01:44.520
The belief in our heart can only be 
released by faith out of our mouth.

0:01:44.520,0:01:49.840
“I believe Jesus will work for me.”

0:01:49.840,0:01:53.300
Where is your faith?

0:01:53.300,0:01:56.400
Faith is practical.

0:01:56.400,0:01:59.220
If you believe, where is your faith?

0:01:59.220,0:02:02.160
Faith is practical.

0:02:02.160,0:02:12.760
If you believe Jesus will heal you, 
you should also reach out in faith;

0:02:12.760,0:02:19.000
you must have the work of faith in that matter.

0:02:19.000,0:02:27.040
"I'm having a headache. I believe Jesus will heal me."

0:02:27.040,0:02:34.680
If I really believe Jesus will heal me,
 I must reach out in faith to Jesus.

0:02:34.680,0:02:37.280
How do we reach out in faith?

0:02:37.280,0:02:43.800
With that headache I should
 not be distressed, or worried.

0:02:43.800,0:02:44.940
I should not be worried.

0:02:44.940,0:02:46.980
People should greet me;
 I should be able to say, "How are you?"

0:02:46.980,0:02:48.000
"Fine."

0:02:48.000,0:02:54.060
I should not look sad; that means
I've reached out in faith.

0:02:54.060,0:03:10.840
Today, we say, "I believe Jesus will heal me", 
but you are still worried, distressed, in anxiety,

0:03:10.840,0:03:12.800
and you say you believe Jesus will heal you.

0:03:12.800,0:03:15.820
Where is your work of faith?

0:03:15.820,0:03:19.460
That means your faith is fake.

0:03:19.460,0:03:23.260
You are expecting money from someone; 
you don't have money -

0:03:23.260,0:03:30.880
somebody promised you and you 
believe in God that the man will pay.

0:03:30.880,0:03:38.740
At that moment you should begin to be happy, even begin to look for what you want to buy with this money,

0:03:38.740,0:03:44.740
even reach out to the market saying, 
"How much is this? 10 dollars, 20 dollars..."

0:03:44.740,0:03:51.560
You have not received that money, but you tell them,
 "I'm coming back. Will you be here? tomorrow?

0:03:51.560,0:03:53.360
I will be here tomorrow. I'm coming back."

0:03:53.360,0:03:57.020
It means you have reached out in faith.

0:03:57.020,0:04:03.520
It is not the situation, where you say, you 
believe that the man will pay you the money

0:04:03.520,0:04:17.140
but you are still at home, worrying, thinking, 
"What if the man will not pay me? What will I do?"

0:04:17.140,0:04:22.820
You are worried as if you have never prayed at all.

0:04:22.820,0:04:26.000
I hope you know the work of faith now.

0:04:26.000,0:04:31.260
It is not enough to believe.

0:04:31.260,0:04:38.500
Today, we have substituted belief for action.

0:04:38.500,0:04:42.500
We should not substitute belief for action.

0:04:42.500,0:04:49.500
‘Action’ is still there because belief is released by faith.

0:04:49.500,0:04:59.220
You must speak your faith and act 
your faith to activate God’s power.

0:04:59.220,0:05:12.020
You cannot activate God’s power without 
speaking words of faith and acting faith.

0:05:12.020,0:05:15.100
'Fake people' can say, "I believe".

0:05:15.100,0:05:18.960
If you are not genuine, you can hide under 'belief'.

0:05:18.960,0:05:25.780
You say, "I believe Jesus. I'm a believer." - fake people.

0:05:25.780,0:05:30.460
Those who are not genuine,
"I'm a believer. I'm born-again."

0:05:30.460,0:05:39.900
If you believe, you should have the 
work of faith in that matter.

0:05:39.900,0:05:47.560
"I believe. Jesus will heal me." - your faith should change immediately, if you have work of faith.

0:05:47.560,0:05:49.460
Smile!

0:05:49.460,0:05:54.120
Greet people around you as if you don't have pain.

0:05:54.120,0:05:58.760
Give a phone call to people, "How are you?"

0:05:58.760,0:06:02.200
Don't look sad, greet.

0:06:02.200,0:06:07.280
If someone around you needs help,
 give out: "What do you need?"

0:06:07.280,0:06:13.440
That's belief; the job is done.

0:06:13.440,0:06:18.380
Healing is something, deliverance is 
something, salvation is something;

0:06:18.380,0:06:24.260
we must reach out in faith.

0:06:24.260,0:06:33.300
Speak your faith and act your
faith to activate God’s power.

0:06:33.300,0:06:42.540
Like you are sitting now; if you are really here and you believe God - God will work for you today -

0:06:42.540,0:06:45.620
you begin to be happy.

0:06:45.620,0:06:50.960
When that healing has not happened, begin to be happy.

0:06:50.960,0:06:53.680
Show your joy.

0:06:53.680,0:06:57.200
Smile.

0:06:57.200,0:07:03.140
Help people, as if you are giving testimony; 
that is work of faith.

0:07:03.140,0:07:11.460
Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised to do.

0:07:11.460,0:07:13.980
Remember father Abraham.

0:07:13.980,0:07:15.840
God is not a man that lies.

0:07:15.840,0:07:19.540
He said He will do it and He will do it.

0:07:19.540,0:07:23.420
If the Son says He will do it, He will do it.

0:07:23.420,0:07:27.540
But if your friend says he will do it, he may not do it.

0:07:27.540,0:07:30.300
If your father says he will do it, he may not do it.

0:07:30.300,0:07:39.600
If your mummy says she will do it, she may not do it but if the Son says He will do it, He will do it indeed!

0:07:39.600,0:07:42.020
That is the work of faith.

0:07:42.020,0:07:45.380
Faith is practical.

0:07:45.380,0:07:50.880
You must always show your faith when you believe.

0:07:50.880,0:08:01.240
It goes together: faith – belief, 
just like prayer and Bible reading;

0:08:01.240,0:08:06.440
one is not complete without the other.

0:08:06.440,0:08:16.060
Belief and faith should always go together; 
one is not complete without the other.

0:08:16.060,0:08:17.240
Tell your neighbour.

0:08:17.240,0:08:29.300
Prayer and Bible reading should always go together;
one is not complete without the other.

0:08:29.300,0:08:44.040
In the same vein, belief and faith should always go together; one is not complete without the other.

0:08:44.040,0:08:48.480
If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.

0:08:48.480,0:08:49.760
Tell your neighbour.

0:08:49.760,0:08:52.920
If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.

0:08:52.920,0:08:54.280
I cannot hear you.

0:08:54.280,0:08:56.900
If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.

0:08:56.900,0:08:58.380
I cannot hear you.

0:08:58.380,0:09:06.560
If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.

0:09:06.560,0:09:20.460
Faith releases belief in our heart
just as a key opens the locked door.

0:09:20.460,0:09:23.640
Put the key - it will open.

0:09:23.640,0:09:31.660
Faith releases belief in our heart.

0:09:31.660,0:09:38.120
No faith – your belief would be dormant in your heart.

0:09:38.120,0:09:42.880
That is why when you speak, 
you speak the word of faith;

0:09:42.880,0:09:54.040
act faith to activate God’s power.

0:09:54.040,0:09:58.500
There are two things you noticed today.

0:09:58.500,0:10:07.520
One: prayer and Bible reading 
should always go together,

0:10:07.520,0:10:15.660
but you on your own - you always pray, 
without reading Bible.

0:10:15.660,0:10:19.860
Where do you get the Word?

0:10:19.860,0:10:27.460
The Word you use in prayer is the 
Word of God, not your word.

0:10:27.460,0:10:31.680
The Word you use, "Father, help me..."

0:10:31.680,0:10:41.140
There are two "help" - the language of your own help, and the language of the Bible.

0:10:41.140,0:10:44.540
"Come!" - there are two "come".

0:10:44.540,0:10:52.840
Man has the ability to come; 
the Holy Spirit comes as He wills.

0:10:52.840,0:11:02.200
It means man has the word, ‘Come’; the
 Holy Spirit also has His own Word, ‘Come’.

0:11:02.200,0:11:06.420
"Good Morning" - there are two "Good Morning".

0:11:06.420,0:11:15.740
Man has the ability to say, “Good Morning”; the Holy Spirit of God also says, “Good Morning”.

0:11:15.740,0:11:22.280
Which one are you using, when you are 
not reading your Bible before praying?

0:11:22.280,0:11:25.100
There are two "walk" - see me.

0:11:25.100,0:11:32.860
Man has the ability to walk, Holy Spirit walks.

0:11:32.860,0:11:34.920
Who is walking here now?

0:11:34.920,0:11:38.040
Look at me - who is walking?

0:11:38.040,0:11:41.080
You don't know - that is the problem.

0:11:41.080,0:11:47.100
Because you look with man's eyes, 
not the eyes of the Holy Spirit.

0:11:47.100,0:11:50.640
So, you don't know who is walking here.

0:11:50.640,0:11:55.780
That's why you can blaspheme, 
speak against, do anything.

0:11:55.780,0:12:00.420
An evil thought in your heart, "Look at him, 
see the way he walks..."

0:12:00.420,0:12:02.700
You don't even know who is walking.

0:12:02.700,0:12:04.560
See - who is walking here?

0:12:04.560,0:12:05.640
You don't know.

0:12:05.640,0:12:12.240
Because you can only know who is walking, 
when you look with the eyes of faith.

0:12:12.240,0:12:19.020
That is, when the Holy Spirit looks through
 you, you know who is walking.

0:12:19.020,0:12:31.780
If you look, you see a man, but if your look
is a look of the Holy Spirit, you see God's being.

0:12:31.780,0:12:33.800
That's the problem.

0:12:33.800,0:12:38.840
When it comes to the things of the 
Spirit in this world, there is a problem.

0:12:38.840,0:12:45.340
If God comes today, He will only show
mercy of taking you to the Kingdom;

0:12:45.340,0:12:49.100
by His mercy you will go to His Kingdom.

0:12:49.100,0:12:57.380
You cannot see Him, talk to Him, relate
 with Him - how will you live for Him?

0:12:57.380,0:13:05.960
If today is our last day on earth, those of us
that will go, will go by His highly mercy.

0:13:05.960,0:13:12.040
Not because you live for Him.

0:13:12.040,0:13:16.400
How will you live for Someone you don't relate with?

0:13:16.400,0:13:21.420
How can you live for Someone you 
cannot even interact with?

0:13:21.420,0:13:27.300
You don't know when He is talking, 
how He is talking...

0:13:27.300,0:13:31.260
You cannot tell me how you relate with your God.

0:13:31.260,0:13:36.800
That is a big problem, when it 
comes to things of the Spirit.

0:13:36.800,0:13:41.680
It is very disappointing; after you have 
finished your Bible, three times, four times,

0:13:41.680,0:13:47.280
from Genesis to Revelation, you can preach
 any verses, even you can write the Bible,

0:13:47.280,0:13:49.820
yet - you don't know God.

0:13:49.820,0:13:52.600
Very disappointing.

0:13:52.600,0:14:05.500
When we are talking of knowing God, there are simple 
ways to start from, instead of deceiving ourselves.

0:14:05.500,0:14:12.540
"Yes, I have the Word, I've studied the Word..."

0:14:12.540,0:14:22.300
This Word of God, the Bible is the 
letter inspired by the Holy Spirit.

0:14:22.300,0:14:33.240
If it is a letter inspired by the Holy Spirit of God, it means the thought of it is from the Spirit of God.

0:14:33.240,0:14:37.620
Now, it is the Spirit of God that we should know.

0:14:37.620,0:14:39.660
How do we know Him?

0:14:39.660,0:14:42.440
By having a free spirit.

0:14:42.440,0:14:51.340
A free spirit is a spirit that is not locked up by sin.

0:14:51.340,0:14:52.800
What are those things?

0:14:52.800,0:15:00.200
Holding grudges, envy, jealousy, pain of the past.

0:15:00.200,0:15:02.100
These are sins.

0:15:02.100,0:15:18.380
"Somebody has cheated me, embarrassed me" - grieve, grudges, envy, strive, unforgiving spirit - these are sins.

0:15:18.380,0:15:25.460
You cannot have a free spirit when
 you are locked up by sin.

0:15:25.460,0:15:28.280
These are the fruits of the sin.

0:15:28.280,0:15:29.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:29.080,0:15:38.520
A free spirit is a spirit that is not locked up by sin.

0:15:38.520,0:15:40.020
What are the sins?

0:15:40.020,0:15:48.720
Envy, jealousy, pain of the past, unforgiving
 spirit, just name them – these are sins.

0:15:48.720,0:15:54.260
When those things lock up your spirit, 
your spirit can never be free.

0:15:54.260,0:16:02.780
A free spirit is sensitive to the Spirit
 of God and if a spirit is locked up by sin,

0:16:02.780,0:16:05.320
it cannot be sensitive to the Spirit of God.

0:16:05.320,0:16:09.460
You want to go for God, you love God - it is not possible,

0:16:09.460,0:16:12.940
because you are locked, you are in the prison.

0:16:12.940,0:16:18.880
The human spirit, when free, is sensitive
 to the Spirit of God.

0:16:18.880,0:16:19.800
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:19.800,0:16:29.260
The human spirit, when free,
 is sensitive to the Spirit of God.

0:16:29.260,0:16:39.820
If it is bound or burdened, it loses that sensitivity.

0:16:39.820,0:16:45.780
When it loses that sensitivity, what else again?

0:16:45.780,0:16:52.680
Therefore, it is useless as an instrument.

0:16:52.680,0:16:56.000
Many of our spirits are useless.

0:16:56.000,0:16:59.000
The purpose of your spirit is to attract that Spirit of God

0:16:59.000,0:17:14.340
but it’s useless because it’s locked up 
by envy, jealousy, anger, pain of the past.

0:17:14.340,0:17:24.180
The purpose of your spirit is to attract God, 
work with God, marry God and admire God.

0:17:24.180,0:17:29.160
"This is God!" - Everywhere, anything of God because He is your Creator!

0:17:29.160,0:17:32.560
You want to admire Him, you want to marry Him, you want to walk with Him,

0:17:32.560,0:17:47.140
but it is useless now because of envy, jealousy - you can think of all those things that locked up your spirit.

0:17:47.140,0:17:51.260
Let someone say, "Free spirit".

0:17:51.260,0:17:58.560
The human spirit, when free, 
is sensitive to the Spirit of God.

0:17:58.560,0:18:07.520
That is, your spirit when free is sensitive, 
it attracts, it marries, it loves God.

0:18:07.520,0:18:14.900
If you say you love God, when your 
spirit is locked, you are deceiving yourself.

0:18:14.900,0:18:24.860
I can see now the reason why we are trying to love God, we try to follow God, we say we love God.

0:18:24.860,0:18:32.240
When there is prayer, you see people
crying, "Oh, my God..."

0:18:32.240,0:18:37.960
He is trying to love God.

0:18:37.960,0:18:42.140
No way.

0:18:42.140,0:18:46.100
It is better to know your problem than not.

0:18:46.100,0:18:52.040
"This is my problem - OK"; you continue to battle with it.

0:18:52.040,0:18:58.800
"This is my problem. I don't know; I thought I knew the Bible."

0:18:58.800,0:19:05.140
"Oh! This is my problem. My spirit is locked up."

0:19:05.140,0:19:06.620
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:06.620,0:19:09.080
This is my problem.

0:19:09.080,0:19:15.340
My spirit is locked up.

0:19:15.340,0:21:17.100
This is my story this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long

0:21:17.100,0:21:18.860
You don't have a problem.

0:21:18.860,0:21:23.240
The only problem you have is
that your spirit is locked up.

0:21:23.240,0:21:25.080
"My spirit is locked up."

0:21:25.080,0:21:27.800
Tell your neighbour.

0:21:27.800,0:21:30.600
If you agree with me, let me see your hand.

0:21:30.600,0:21:35.840
Please, if you agree with me, 
raise up your hand that you agree.

0:21:35.840,0:21:41.600
All this, Genesis, this, that - stop that.

0:21:41.600,0:21:45.440
Your spirit is locked up.

0:21:45.440,0:21:47.780
How to open it?

0:21:47.780,0:21:52.360
How to be free and become an instrument?

0:21:52.360,0:21:54.680
That is what we have to talk about now.

0:21:54.680,0:21:59.980
Your spirit is locked up.

0:21:59.980,0:22:08.900
Envy, jealousy, anger, all this, is an instrument that locks my spirit.

0:22:08.900,0:22:19.860
If my spirit is not free, it can never be sensitive to the Spirit of God; it will lose that sensitivity.

0:22:19.860,0:22:24.580
This is nail and magnet; if you bring them...

0:22:24.580,0:22:31.220
But when your spirit is locked up, it can't magnetize.

0:22:31.220,0:22:36.280
Thank You, Lord.

0:22:36.280,0:22:42.800
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:22:42.800,0:22:50.820
You can see the reason why I don't reply critics.

0:22:50.820,0:22:57.240
They say this, that; I will remain silent, because I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.

0:22:57.240,0:23:03.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:03.000,0:23:09.020
You will never hear me standing here and 
criticizing ministers of God, or any church,

0:23:09.020,0:23:13.700
that they are this, that  - 
I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.

0:23:13.700,0:23:19.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:19.660,0:23:24.960
I will not stand on Emmanuel TV and say, "Hey, miracle - come to The Synagogue and worship".

0:23:24.960,0:23:25.800
No.

0:23:25.800,0:23:27.900
Does it mean other churches are not good?

0:23:27.900,0:23:31.000
I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.

0:23:31.000,0:23:35.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:35.180,0:23:40.440
When you are coming from the airport, you are supposed to see Synagogue sign boards everywhere.

0:23:40.440,0:23:44.440
No, we don't have any sign boards, no sign posts.

0:23:44.440,0:23:48.280
This is not the only living church; 
there are other living churches.

0:23:48.280,0:23:51.720
I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.

0:23:51.720,0:23:57.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:57.300,0:24:04.500
When I wake up in the morning and I'm coming to the service, they will put all the dresses, suits, fine ones.

0:24:04.500,0:24:07.500
I say, "No no no. Just give me a simple one.

0:24:07.500,0:24:14.040
Remember, they are here to see Prophet T.B. Joshua, not Mr T.B. Joshua".

0:24:14.040,0:24:19.300
If you pay much attention on Mr T.B. Joshua,
it becomes a sin.

0:24:19.300,0:24:22.700
It is Mr T.B. Joshua that puts on the dress.

0:24:22.700,0:24:30.360
If Mr T.B. Joshua dresses 
gorgeously and says, "Hello, hi..."

0:24:30.360,0:24:34.480
and you are sitting down and begin to count, 
"How much are those shoes?

0:24:34.480,0:24:38.680
How much is this dress? Look at him! Oh my God!"

0:24:38.680,0:24:43.880
It becomes a sin and it will lock up my spirit.

0:24:43.880,0:24:47.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:47.500,0:24:56.880
Criticizing, abusing, jealousy, envy...

0:24:56.880,0:25:00.040
You hear something you don't want to hear...

0:25:00.040,0:25:02.800
It is what you want hear, you will hear.

0:25:02.800,0:25:09.900
If people know that you are on the side of God - what is pure, clean, admirable,

0:25:09.900,0:25:14.840
is all what you want to hear - those things will be coming to you.

0:25:14.840,0:25:23.860
But if it is what is condemning, destroying, criticizing, killing, destroying, stealing is what you want to hear,

0:25:23.860,0:25:32.800
those things will be coming to you, to destroy
your spirit and to lock up your spirit.

0:25:32.800,0:25:40.240
I have been praying for you to know better.

0:25:40.240,0:25:47.400
When you are rebuking me, banning me, 
praying against me, I keep praying for you,

0:25:47.400,0:25:51.700
because I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.

0:25:51.700,0:26:02.820
Because my spirit is an instrument to 
attract God's Spirit, to walk with God's Spirit.

0:26:02.820,0:26:06.460
If the spirit were locked, you would not be
able to come here today.

0:26:06.460,0:26:10.520
All what we are seeing happening in
 the life of T.B. Joshua would not happen.

0:26:10.520,0:26:15.580
It is because my spirit is sensitive, 
attracting God's Spirit,

0:26:15.580,0:26:19.800
that is why you see miracle, deliverance, 
all this happen.

0:26:19.800,0:26:25.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:25.720,0:26:32.780
You don’t need to be perfect to be used
by God but you need to be available.

0:26:32.780,0:26:39.300
You are available, when you do away with 
those things and allow your spirit to be free.

0:26:39.300,0:26:43.300
Something may have happened to you 
yesterday - put it behind you.

0:26:43.300,0:26:56.140
I’m married to Jesus
Satan leave me alone

0:26:56.140,0:27:11.520
My husband is coming to take me away
To everlasting home

0:27:11.520,0:27:13.560
What is the meaning of that?

0:27:13.560,0:27:16.660
I'm married to what?

0:27:16.660,0:27:19.440
Jesus.

0:27:19.440,0:27:26.660
I’m married to love
Hatred leave me alone

0:27:26.660,0:27:29.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:29.740,0:27:37.700
I’m married to faithfulness 
Unfaithfulness leave me alone

0:27:37.700,0:27:41.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:41.140,0:27:44.920
That is the meaning.

0:27:44.920,0:27:51.660
Their nature is what the Bible is talking 
about; the nature of satan - leave me,

0:27:51.660,0:27:54.120
the nature of God - I'm married with You.

0:27:54.120,0:27:59.080
I'm married to goodness; bad - leave me alone.

0:27:59.080,0:28:03.040
I'm married to faithfulness; unfaithfulness, 
leave me alone.

0:28:03.040,0:28:07.620
I'm married to humility; pride - leave me alone.

0:28:07.620,0:28:13.240
I'm married to love, hatred - leave me alone.

0:28:13.240,0:28:18.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:18.640,0:28:19.880
That is it.

0:28:19.880,0:28:28.240
But in your own case, you think marrying to Jesus...
- where will you see Jesus to marry?

0:28:28.240,0:28:30.360
You can only get married to His nature.

0:28:30.360,0:28:31.840
Tell your neighbour.

0:28:31.840,0:28:34.300
Where will you see Him?

0:28:34.300,0:28:37.660
You can only get married to His nature.

0:28:37.660,0:28:41.300
I cannot hear you; stand up!

0:28:41.300,0:28:44.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:44.960,0:28:51.100
Where will you see Him to do wedding?

0:28:51.100,0:28:53.860
You can only wed who?

0:28:53.860,0:29:03.560
His nature, faithfulness, kindness, 
goodness, humility, love!

0:29:03.560,0:29:08.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:08.580,0:29:11.840
You can only marry His nature.

0:29:11.840,0:29:15.600
He is talking about His nature.

0:29:15.600,0:29:21.260
His nature - when you know that, 
you know how to live your life.

0:29:21.260,0:29:25.320
Leave me unfaithfulness, I'm married with faithfulness.

0:29:25.320,0:29:29.980
Leave me disobedience, I'm married with obedience.

0:29:29.980,0:29:34.200
That is what we are talking about.

0:29:34.200,0:29:35.400
Viewers, thank you.
