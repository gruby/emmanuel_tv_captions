This is the section of pregnant women,

0:00:02.240,0:00:04.440
who are here for safe delivery.

0:00:04.440,0:00:08.200
Many of them have been booked for operations because of complications.

0:00:08.200,0:00:12.880
They are here looking in faith to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to be free

0:00:12.880,0:00:16.460
so that they can deliver their babies safely without any complications,

0:00:16.460,0:00:19.720
without any surgical operations.

0:00:19.720,0:00:37.040

0:00:37.040,0:00:42.100
Here is one of those have come today for safe delivery,

0:00:42.100,0:00:45.260
BABY BORN AS PASTOR PRAYS!!!

0:00:45.260,0:00:50.420
The resurrection power of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is working in the midst of the people.

0:00:50.420,0:00:53.060
I can see what is happening to this pregnant woman

0:00:53.060,0:00:57.320
See what she passed out as the man of God stretched forth his hand towards her,

0:00:57.320,0:01:02.360
praying for her in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:01:02.360,0:01:04.120
Receive deliverance!

0:01:04.120,0:01:08.380
Be free! Out!

0:01:08.380,0:01:09.500
Come out!

0:01:09.500,0:01:11.420
Out, Ezekiel!

0:01:11.420,0:01:20.060
BABY BORN AS PASTOR PRAYS!!!

0:01:20.060,0:01:24.520
What you have just watched is the miraculous birth of baby Ezekiel.

0:01:24.520,0:01:30.800
Mrs. Geneva Amam had come to the SCOAN with complications in her pregnancy.

0:01:30.800,0:01:33.640
The doctors had diagnosed a tight cervix

0:01:33.640,0:01:37.060
for which they had booked her for an operation.

0:01:37.060,0:01:40.420
Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for Geneva in the prayer line

0:01:40.420,0:01:46.520
and immediately, her water broke and she went into labour.

0:01:46.520,0:01:51.140
Some moments later, Prophet T.B. Joshua went to her at the labour room

0:01:51.140,0:01:53.240
and spoke a word of prophecy,

0:01:53.240,0:01:56.920
identifying both the name and the gender of the child,

0:01:56.920,0:01:59.920
saying, "Ezekiel, come out!"

0:01:59.920,0:02:03.960
Instantly, baby Ezekiel was delivered.

0:02:03.960,0:02:05.000

Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:07.180,0:02:12.780
My name is Geneva Amam, I am from Imo state.

0:02:12.780,0:02:15.160
I am 30 years old.

0:02:15.160,0:02:19.120
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN last Sunday

0:02:19.120,0:02:24.780
was that of a tight cervix for which I was booked for an operation

0:02:24.780,0:02:29.400
and also that of high blood pressure.

0:02:29.400,0:02:35.700
When all these things were happening, I was rejected by 2 to 3 hospitals.

0:02:35.700,0:02:41.300
They said the baby was too big and they could not handle the baby.

0:02:41.300,0:02:46.520
The one that accepted later said that because of the high blood pressure,

0:02:46.520,0:02:50.480
they would not be able to operate on me.

0:02:50.480,0:02:54.800
The cervix was tight, there was no way the baby could come out

0:02:54.800,0:02:59.260
and my blood pressure was too high for them to operate on me.

0:02:59.260,0:03:03.220
So my husband now took me down to The SCOAN

0:03:03.220,0:03:06.760
where I was arranged at the emergency section

0:03:06.760,0:03:09.120
and the man of God prayed for me.

0:03:09.120,0:03:13.760
Immediately he touched my foot with his foot, the water that

0:03:13.760,0:03:19.160
was holding the baby and making the cervix tight burst

0:03:19.160,0:03:25.640
and poured out instantly and my body became cool and calm.

0:03:25.640,0:03:31.820
After some time, labour started, yet the baby could not come out.

0:03:31.820,0:03:39.860
The man of God came and prayed for me and said, "Ezekiel, come out!"

0:03:39.860,0:03:44.820
Instantly - where the power came from, I can't imagine -

0:03:44.820,0:03:50.300
the baby just came out; all I heard was the cry of a baby and he's a baby boy.

0:03:50.300,0:03:55.540
I was shocked, I was surprised. I said, "How?

0:03:55.540,0:03:59.900
How did the man of God know that I was carrying a baby boy?"

0:03:59.900,0:04:05.940
The whole thing - I was like crying, but I give God the glory

0:04:05.940,0:04:11.840
because the baby is alive and I myself, I'm alive, strong and healthy.

0:04:11.840,0:04:19.060
That is why we are here today to glorify the name of God, to bless His name

0:04:19.060,0:04:25.460
because what man cannot do, God did through the able hand of

0:04:25.460,0:04:29.120
His anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:04:29.120,0:04:33.100
And here, you can see me carrying Ezekiel.

0:04:33.100,0:04:37.340
I thank God for that; I give God all the glory.

0:04:37.340,0:04:39.800
I am Mr. Patrick Amam.

0:04:39.800,0:04:44.640
The woman next to me is my wife, Mrs Geneva Amam.

0:04:44.640,0:04:52.240
The baby's name is Ezekiel Amam. He was delivered in last Sunday's service.

0:04:52.240,0:04:59.460
We had the problem of my wife being unable to deliver her baby safely in the hospital.

0:04:59.460,0:05:06.380
Before 4 am that Sunday morning, I called the hospital -

0:05:06.380,0:05:14.380
she told me that she had not delivered, and worse, still that she had a tight cervix.

0:05:14.380,0:05:18.980
I ran down to the hospital as early as 4 am.

0:05:18.980,0:05:25.940
I noticed that my wife had even become weak and had developed high blood pressure.

0:05:25.940,0:05:29.560
I knew that we needed God's intervention.

0:05:29.560,0:05:38.880
We could not trust the medical operation they had given us as an option for the delivery.

0:05:38.880,0:05:42.260
I told my wife, "All you need is God's intervention".

0:05:42.260,0:05:45.760
I took her away. The hospital objected.

0:05:45.760,0:05:51.800
I said, "Keep our load. If God intervenes, I can return her to you."

0:05:51.800,0:05:54.480
Then they allowed us to go.

0:05:54.480,0:06:01.940
We came here directly - my wife and I to the emergency line of The SCOAN.

0:06:01.940,0:06:08.840
We had the luck that the man of God came and prayed for her.

0:06:08.840,0:06:14.920
The first time the man of God prayed for her, the cervix opened,

0:06:14.920,0:06:23.000
the water gushed out and my wife felt cool in her system.

0:06:23.000,0:06:26.540
I had peace; I was happy.

0:06:26.540,0:06:33.020
The man of God came the second time and mentioned the sex of the baby

0:06:33.020,0:06:37.820
while the baby was still in the womb - 'Ezekiel' three times.

0:06:37.820,0:06:44.400
He said, "Ezekiel, come out!" and the boy rushed out immediately and cried.

0:06:44.400,0:06:48.700
There was jubilation everywhere in the church.

0:06:48.700,0:06:50.380
We give God the glory.

0:06:50.380,0:06:55.540
I thank God for this mercy and favour for my family.

0:06:55.540,0:07:01.460
