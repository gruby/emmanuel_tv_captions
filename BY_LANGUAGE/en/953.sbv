God is still saying something.

0:00:03.060,0:00:10.920
On Sunday 31st of August 2014, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy

0:00:10.920,0:00:15.940
concerning a military intervention in a Southern African country.

0:00:15.940,0:00:18.260
Let us listen to his words.

0:00:18.260,0:00:22.780
A president will be kidnapped; I mentioned it.

0:00:22.780,0:00:25.820
I mean, Southern African people will remember,

0:00:25.820,0:00:30.120
if they are not going to misquote me this time.

0:00:30.120,0:00:31.900
But this time, what I'm saying now -

0:00:31.900,0:00:34.320
quote me well; don't misquote me.

0:00:34.320,0:00:40.640
I am seeing military - they are still on that plan

0:00:40.640,0:00:46.040
to kidnap either the President, or Vice President of that nation,

0:00:46.040,0:00:48.400
or the First Lady of that nation.

0:00:48.400,0:00:53.720
They are aiming to do that and they are still serious to do it.

0:00:53.720,0:00:56.960
The plan is going on now.

0:00:56.960,0:01:00.420
If prayer is not offered well, they will succeed.

0:01:00.420,0:01:06.300
If he refuses the order, they will kill him.

0:01:06.300,0:01:08.240
That is what I'm seeing.

0:01:08.240,0:01:12.400
They should pray for Southern Africa - a president.

0:01:12.400,0:01:18.200
God showed me the place but I don't want to put any country into pandemonium.

0:01:18.200,0:01:22.420
But Southern Africa - they should pray for them.

0:01:22.420,0:01:25.280
Pray for them; God loves them.
