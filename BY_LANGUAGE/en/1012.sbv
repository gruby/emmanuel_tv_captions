For there is no one, except You, Jesus, in Heaven and on earth!

0:03:30.040,0:03:34.660
There is nobody!

0:03:34.660,0:03:36.440
Give it to Him!

If you know that He is greater than anything today, lift your hands and say:

0:04:21.080,0:04:24.900
How great You are

0:04:24.900,0:04:29.560
It's so simple. Just open your lips and say, "How great You are, Jesus!"

0:04:29.560,0:04:34.740
How great You are

0:04:34.740,0:04:38.000
You are so great to us, Jesus! We love You!

0:04:38.000,0:04:50.820

0:10:06.740,0:10:15.780
I want to salute our viewers all over the world for your time. Thank you very much.

0:10:15.780,0:10:28.920
Wherever you are, Jesus is there. The state of your heart matters; distance is not a barrier.

0:10:28.920,0:10:31.420
Are you there, my viewers?

0:10:31.420,0:10:34.680
Yes. Thank you.

0:10:34.680,0:10:37.380
God gave me a Word for you today.

0:10:37.380,0:10:45.480
That quickly leads me to the book of Psalm 66 which I'm going to read for you right now.

0:10:45.480,0:10:49.620
The book of Psalm 66.

0:10:49.620,0:10:58.840
"For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.

0:10:58.840,0:11:05.580
You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.

0:11:05.580,0:11:14.120
You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water,

0:11:14.120,0:11:20.660
but you brought us to a place of abundance."

0:11:20.660,0:11:25.180
Listen to that again. Let me read that verse 12.

0:11:25.180,0:11:36.660
"You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water,

0:11:36.660,0:11:42.000
but you brought us to a place of abundance."

0:11:42.000,0:11:53.580
This means God refines us with affliction.

0:11:53.580,0:12:09.620
It means sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial and affliction,

0:12:09.620,0:12:24.560
just as impurities hide in gold unless it goes through the furnace.

0:12:24.560,0:12:33.120
Impurities will hide in gold.

0:12:33.120,0:12:41.240
I was trying to ask a gentleman in the church - I believe he will be in the church today -

0:12:41.240,0:12:45.540
after calling and calling, I said, "Can you trace this man inside the church?"

0:12:45.540,0:12:53.420
Later, I got to know that the man did not come to church today. I said, "Why?"

0:12:53.420,0:13:01.800
Because he has a knocked engine.

0:13:01.800,0:13:08.800
He got up in the morning and found out that the vehicle's engine knocked.

0:13:08.800,0:13:12.580
That should be the reason.

0:13:12.580,0:13:20.160
As if the God that gave the vehicle cannot withdraw the vehicle.

0:13:20.160,0:13:29.300
The God that gave the vehicle to you cannot as well withdraw it?

0:13:29.300,0:13:37.420
When He noticed what only He Himself knows -

0:13:37.420,0:13:41.420
nobody knows the reason; He can decide to withdraw what He has given you.

0:13:41.420,0:13:44.320
God Himself. That is God for you.

0:13:44.320,0:13:49.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:49.560,0:13:56.640
When God noticed what only He has knowledge of - nobody knows the reason;

0:13:56.640,0:14:01.840
but He knows that if He allows this man to take this vehicle today,

0:14:01.840,0:14:05.580
something worse might happen to him.

0:14:05.580,0:14:15.380
So because of that, something will happen to the vehicle to preserve the man, to protect you.

0:14:15.380,0:14:18.480
To preserve him for the greater...

0:14:18.480,0:14:22.660
But because of this, our brother did not come to church.

0:14:22.660,0:14:25.360
He said, "Ah, the engine knocked".

0:14:25.360,0:14:28.060
"Hm, the engine knocked?"

0:14:28.060,0:14:36.000
That was the only reason given.

0:14:36.000,0:14:48.060
This is the manifestation of sin which hides where there is no heat of trial.

0:14:48.060,0:14:51.420
Manifestation of weakness.

0:14:51.420,0:14:58.520
When there is no heat of trial and temptation, you look so nice and gentle.

0:14:58.520,0:15:04.680
Very godly. It is too early to say, "Eh, this is a pastor, this is a bishop, this is a born-again".

0:15:04.680,0:15:07.440
"This is..." - whatever you call the name.

0:15:07.440,0:15:10.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:10.820,0:15:18.380
Let the heat of trial come before you judge, before you say, "This is T.B. Joshua,

0:15:18.380,0:15:20.660
this is Prophet T.B. Joshua, this is a bishop".

0:15:20.660,0:15:25.460
Allow the heat of trial and temptation come. Then you can say that he is a bishop.

0:15:25.460,0:15:32.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:32.660,0:15:42.120
Tell your fellow Christian brother there what he does not want to hear and hear the reaction.

0:15:42.120,0:15:44.120
"He is a born-again".

0:15:44.120,0:15:48.780
You know that he is a pastor or whoever - your neighbour inside the church.

0:15:48.780,0:15:56.660
Just tell him what he does not want to hear at all and see his reaction.

0:15:56.660,0:15:59.480
Let will tell you that he is a born-again.

0:15:59.480,0:16:05.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:05.440,0:16:12.220
Your weaknesses hide where there is no heat of trial and temptation.

0:16:12.220,0:16:13.380
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:13.380,0:16:18.260
Your weaknesses hide where there is no heat of trial and temptation.

0:16:18.260,0:16:23.600
Sin hides where there is no heat of trial and temptation.

0:16:23.600,0:16:27.180
You see a man, very nice and quiet.

0:16:27.180,0:16:31.640
"Hm, he is quiet."

0:16:31.640,0:16:39.800
Ok. Tell him what he does not want to hear and see his reaction.

0:16:39.800,0:16:48.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:48.240,0:16:54.180
Where there is no heat of trial and temptation, our weaknesses hide.

0:16:54.180,0:16:57.560
As if we are truly born-again.

0:16:57.560,0:17:03.000
Indeed, let temptation come.

0:17:03.000,0:17:09.880
Let someone lie against you. Let us see how you handle the situation.

0:17:09.880,0:17:18.400
Your response to offence matters - determines your future.

0:17:18.400,0:17:33.260
Your response to temptation, heat of trial, affliction determines your salvation.

0:17:33.260,0:17:47.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:47.300,0:17:52.200
Don't forget the case of Job.

0:17:52.200,0:18:07.920
Before satan went to Job, he first consulted the Almighty God to give him permission.

0:18:07.920,0:18:12.900
What are you going through?

0:18:12.900,0:18:21.220
Ask God to help you make the most of difficulties.

0:18:21.220,0:18:24.380
What is your situation?

0:18:24.380,0:18:27.980
They are not meant to destroy you.

0:18:27.980,0:18:32.140
It may be to refine you.

0:18:32.140,0:18:34.460
I want to tell you:

0:18:34.460,0:18:42.720
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:18:42.720,0:18:44.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:18:44.080,0:18:47.420
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:18:47.420,0:18:48.420
I can't hear you.

0:18:48.420,0:18:50.160
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:18:50.160,0:18:55.260
Because we don't know and it is difficult for us men of God to preach this -

0:18:55.260,0:18:58.140
because how do we preach it?

0:18:58.140,0:19:05.160
I listen every day, all the time, to this message but it is so difficult.

0:19:05.160,0:19:07.860
This is my personal experience.

0:19:07.860,0:19:20.600
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life, your adverse circumstances

0:19:20.600,0:19:48.080
for the purpose of cleansing and separating us from unclean and impure elements

0:19:48.080,0:19:56.380
such as anger, bitterness, unforgiveness.

0:20:06.220,0:20:13.360
Yes. Take this quote.

0:20:13.360,0:20:20.900
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:20:20.900,0:20:31.180
You ask God all the time to help you to make the most of difficulties.

0:20:31.180,0:20:34.260
Help me as You did Joseph.

0:20:34.260,0:20:40.840
You know what Joseph went through before the palace, before the throne.

0:20:40.840,0:20:46.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:46.640,0:20:49.480
Potiphar's house - you know what happened.

0:20:49.480,0:20:53.000
Pit - you know what happened.

0:20:53.000,0:21:05.020
Ask Him, "Help me, Lord, as You did Joseph to make the most of difficulties".

0:21:05.020,0:21:19.580
Help me in my adverse circumstances to make the most of difficulties.

0:21:19.580,0:21:37.780
All these that make you cry, lament, depressed - they are there to preserve you.

0:21:37.780,0:21:54.080
It is time you should begin to see adverse circumstances as a friend, not enemy

0:21:54.080,0:22:01.860
because oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:22:01.860,0:22:10.260
Your difficulty, sickness, disease, affliction, setback, attack.

0:22:10.260,0:22:15.740
Oftentimes, God works through them.

0:22:15.740,0:22:18.000
Are you with me?

0:22:18.000,0:22:30.360
Oftentimes, God works through them to take you to the throne.

0:22:30.360,0:22:32.180
He works through them.

0:22:32.180,0:22:33.280
Tell your neighbour:

0:22:33.280,0:22:51.020
Oftentimes, God works through my pain, affliction, setback - whatever you call it.

0:22:51.020,0:22:52.500
He works through them.

0:22:52.500,0:22:58.260
But when this comes, you lament, "Ah, this is the enemy! This is wahalla! This is trouble!

0:22:58.260,0:23:01.160
This is to destroy me!"

0:23:01.160,0:23:06.780
Time to be depressed, cry, lament, commit suicide.

0:23:06.780,0:23:10.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:10.700,0:23:22.640
If you had not gone through that pain, who knows what would have happened to you.

0:23:22.640,0:23:27.320
If you had not been on the sickbed for a while, and you are out there,

0:23:27.320,0:23:36.280
going everywhere you want to go, who knows what would have happened to you.

0:23:36.280,0:23:40.660
If you had not run into debt at the time you run into debt,

0:23:40.660,0:23:47.620
who knows what would have happened to you if you had had the chance to move everywhere.

0:23:47.620,0:23:51.100
If you had got that pregnancy and had a baby,

0:23:51.100,0:23:54.600
who knows what would have happened to you whilst being in the pregnancy stage

0:23:54.600,0:23:57.000
or if you had that baby, who knows what would have happened.

0:23:57.000,0:24:01.300
If you had not been sacked from that place, who knows what would have happened.

0:24:01.300,0:24:02.620
Tell your neighbour.

0:24:02.620,0:24:10.480
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:24:10.480,0:24:16.620
So it is now time for you to think about yourself.

0:24:16.620,0:24:21.220
Think about yourself.

0:24:21.220,0:24:27.180
"Ah! I was going from one witchdoctor to another because of this problem.

0:24:27.180,0:24:39.360
I never knew that God was working through it to take me to the throne!

0:24:39.360,0:24:44.260
I was looking at God in a very bad light!

0:24:44.260,0:24:48.160
'Ah, my God! What happened! Why did this happen?'

0:24:48.160,0:24:52.500
I never knew God was working things out for me through it."

0:24:52.500,0:25:01.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:01.200,0:25:08.780
So rise up right now and say after me with all your heart:

0:25:08.780,0:25:15.440
Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.

0:25:15.440,0:25:16.620
I can't hear you.

0:25:16.620,0:25:19.860
Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.

0:25:19.860,0:25:20.960
I can't hear you.

0:25:20.960,0:25:23.880
Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.

0:25:23.880,0:25:25.140
I can't hear you.

0:25:25.140,0:25:28.360
Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.

0:25:28.360,0:25:35.140
Do you know the reason? Because Jesus is Lord over your life.

0:25:35.140,0:25:39.560
That is why you need greater understanding of His heart.

0:25:39.560,0:25:42.940
If I'm right? Jesus is Lord over your life.

0:25:42.940,0:25:44.820
Am I right?

0:25:44.820,0:25:45.960
I can't hear you.

0:25:45.960,0:25:47.060
Yes!

0:25:47.060,0:25:48.800
Who is Lord over your life?

0:25:48.800,0:25:50.160
Jesus!

0:25:50.160,0:25:52.160
Who is Lord over your life?

0:25:52.160,0:25:53.400
Jesus!

0:25:53.400,0:26:09.420
Open your lips and say to the Lord, "Give me a greater understanding of Your heart

0:26:09.420,0:26:16.780
because Jesus is Lord over my life!"

0:26:16.780,0:26:19.560
"Because You are the Lord over my life,

0:26:19.560,0:26:27.100
give me a greater understanding of Your heart!"

Overflow Congregation

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:45.420,0:26:49.380
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:26:49.380,0:26:55.220
You know, if you ask many people here today, "What is your dream?"

0:26:55.220,0:26:58.060
They say, "No, I don't even understand whether I dream.

0:26:58.060,0:27:00.960
I don't even understand the word 'dream'".

0:27:00.960,0:27:08.520
And God gives dream to guide us for this life.

0:27:08.520,0:27:13.040
To guide you - it is for guiding.

0:27:13.040,0:27:18.720
He gives dream to guide us for this life.

0:27:18.720,0:27:27.040
Without dream, you will continue to walk in the dark, without direction.

0:27:27.040,0:27:31.620
People believe that they must sleep before they have a dream.

0:27:31.620,0:27:33.760
It is a thing of the heart.

0:27:33.760,0:27:38.800
Like you are standing now - dream is going on.

0:27:38.800,0:27:46.460
The thought of God - your heart is telling you, "Ho, yes, yes!"

0:27:46.460,0:27:51.660
This is why we are asking for a greater understanding of God's heart -

0:27:51.660,0:27:57.040
because Jesus is Lord over your life.

0:27:57.040,0:28:03.020
Ask God to help you to see the dream for you.

0:28:03.020,0:28:07.140
But not ask God for the dream - the dream is there already!

0:28:07.140,0:28:10.180
Some people will say, "Ok, ask for dream! Dream! I want to dream!"

0:28:10.180,0:28:14.680
No! Already! It is only that you are ignorant.

0:28:14.680,0:28:18.380
You can't understand the voice of God.

0:28:18.380,0:28:27.180
This is why I said to you that what you are going through,

0:28:27.180,0:28:36.340
is to separate you from (what is) unclean and impure such as bitterness, hatred.

0:28:36.340,0:28:40.120
A lot is going on in your heart.

0:28:40.120,0:28:43.520
Pain of the past, offence.

0:28:43.520,0:28:53.400
You need a greater understanding of God's heart to know that what you are going through,

0:28:53.400,0:28:55.220
God is aware.

0:28:55.220,0:28:59.880
God is working through your circumstances.

0:28:59.880,0:29:02.740
God is working through your sickness.

0:29:02.740,0:29:05.480
God is working through your affliction.

0:29:05.480,0:29:08.880
God is working through your setback.

0:29:08.880,0:29:13.620
You need a greater understanding of God's heart to understand this.

0:29:13.620,0:29:19.400
If not, you will continue to run to the witchdoctor, to join a secret cult because of your problem.

0:29:19.400,0:29:21.400
Run into this, run into that.

0:29:21.400,0:29:24.360
Making a covenant to the world.

0:29:24.360,0:29:28.040
Run into this and that because you don't understand.

0:29:28.040,0:29:32.620
You think this is a problem, this is satan to you

0:29:32.620,0:29:40.920
whereas oftentimes, God works through your circumstances of life.

0:29:40.920,0:29:45.520
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:29:45.520,0:29:50.600
In the mighty name of Jesus, see your dream!

0:29:50.600,0:29:54.480
You people pray for dream. Don't pray for the dream; it is there already.

0:29:54.480,0:29:57.760
As you are created, you are created with a dream.

0:29:57.760,0:30:01.820
Dream means direction. This is direction but you can't see.

0:30:01.820,0:30:04.500
But for you to ask now for direction, God should give you that...

0:30:04.500,0:30:06.820
No! The direction is there already!

0:30:06.820,0:30:12.840
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:30:12.840,0:30:16.480
What is my dream? How will I get there?

0:30:16.480,0:30:24.940
Our walking with the Lord - good and hard times alike.

0:30:24.940,0:30:27.320
You are walking with the Lord.

0:30:27.320,0:30:32.100
Hard - good.

0:30:32.100,0:30:40.100
Hard could be sickness, disease, setback, temptation, affliction.

0:30:40.100,0:30:44.600
Good - bad.

0:30:44.600,0:30:47.340
That is our walking with the Lord.

0:30:47.340,0:30:53.460
Oftentimes, he works through the circumstances of life.

0:30:53.460,0:30:57.880
Good - bad.

0:30:57.880,0:31:00.700
This is how you are built.

0:31:00.700,0:31:03.940
In the same vein, day - night.

0:31:03.940,0:31:07.540
When it is night, you have to sleep.

0:31:07.540,0:31:11.860
That is how you grow and become old; through day - night.

0:31:11.860,0:31:18.060
You become strong in the Lord through good and bad.

0:31:18.060,0:31:24.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:24.380,0:31:31.740
You just need a greater understanding of God's heart to understand this.

0:31:31.740,0:31:38.040
Our walking with the Lord - good and hard times alike.

0:31:38.040,0:31:43.640
A lot of hard time whilst you are sacrified.

0:31:43.640,0:31:50.440
But reward, a lot of good - there will be hard time but so much good.

0:31:50.440,0:31:54.440
But sacrify - the word 'sacrify' - reward.

0:31:54.440,0:31:57.820
Sacrify - a lot of hard time.

0:31:57.820,0:32:00.920
Not that there will be good but a lot of hard time.

0:32:00.920,0:32:04.280
And you are sacrified now.

0:32:04.280,0:32:07.780
You have not yet reached the reward time.

0:32:07.780,0:32:13.360
Forget about your age.

0:32:13.360,0:32:19.360
When you reach reward time, you will begin to eat with the Lord, see vision clear,

0:32:19.360,0:32:22.920
have a greater understanding of God's heart.

0:32:22.920,0:32:26.140
As I'm standing now, you will be able to ... oh my God!

0:32:26.140,0:32:31.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:31.080,0:32:35.140
As I'm standing now, you will be able to know who is talking to you.

0:32:35.140,0:32:38.440
It is T.B. Joshua or Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:32:38.440,0:32:42.240
But right now, I don't think anyone knows who is talking to him.

0:32:42.240,0:32:46.220
You only see a man standing, called T.B. Joshua. You don't know who is talking to you.

0:32:46.220,0:32:52.520
That is why it is difficult for you to believe, unless the mighty grace comes upon you.

0:32:52.520,0:32:54.380
You need faith to believe.

0:32:54.380,0:33:06.620
Tell your neighbour, "I need faith to believe. Give me faith to believe".

0:33:06.620,0:33:08.080
I can't hear you.

0:33:08.080,0:33:11.360
I need faith to believe. Give me faith to believe.

0:33:11.360,0:33:13.560
Who is going to give you faith?

0:33:13.560,0:33:15.160
God!

0:33:15.160,0:33:19.520
I need faith to believe. Give me faith to believe.

0:33:19.520,0:33:23.160
You need faith to believe. You don't just run into the church and say,

0:33:23.160,0:33:25.820
"They said I should come to the Synagogue today. Ok, I'm in the Synagogue.

0:33:25.820,0:33:28.140
I believe. I believe in what is happening here".

0:33:28.140,0:33:31.800
Oh, you believe? But you still need faith to believe.

0:33:31.800,0:33:33.580
Back again.

0:33:33.580,0:33:39.920
Dream is a gift of God.

0:33:39.920,0:33:41.060
Tell your neighbour.

0:33:41.060,0:33:43.540
Dream is a gift of God.

0:33:43.540,0:33:45.860
Some people say, "I want to dream".

0:33:45.860,0:33:48.580
Pray, fast. Fast, pray.

0:33:48.580,0:33:52.220
It is a gift. Something that is a gift from God.

0:33:52.220,0:34:00.380
Not the work of righteousness which you have done but according to His grace you dream.

0:34:00.380,0:34:04.860
It is a gift from God, just as faith is a gift from God.

0:34:04.860,0:34:07.140
That is why you say, "I need faith.

0:34:07.140,0:34:13.840
You can manufacture your belief but faith cannot be (manufactured)

0:34:13.840,0:34:17.900
because you must have that faith in the finished work of God.

0:34:17.900,0:34:21.480
Not in yourself - you can decide to believe.

0:34:21.480,0:34:24.760
"I believe the man. I believe the business."

0:34:24.760,0:34:30.060
But the word faith cannot be used that way.

0:34:30.060,0:34:48.400
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:34:48.400,0:34:55.620
There is no way we can see our dream when in hard times, we lament.

0:34:55.620,0:35:01.300
You run to the witchdoctor, lamenting.

0:35:01.300,0:35:07.860
You stop praying; you stop even coming to church.

0:35:07.860,0:35:13.320
If God that gave you a vehicle decided to withdraw it,

0:35:13.320,0:35:21.280
when He noticed what only Him understands, is it a crime?

0:35:21.280,0:35:26.300
The One that gave you can decide to withdraw it.

0:35:26.300,0:35:28.860
Can you see?

0:35:28.860,0:35:35.740
To test your faith, someone can just come to lie against you, to show your response -

0:35:35.740,0:35:38.460
those you kept inside.

0:35:38.460,0:35:42.440
To people, you are a man of God. To people, you are a born-again.

0:35:42.440,0:35:47.880
But let this temptation come and see how you react.

0:35:47.880,0:35:52.880
A lot of people have been in the court - you have sued them for this and that.

0:35:52.880,0:36:03.120
You never knew that God works through the circumstances of life.

0:36:03.120,0:36:09.260
That is why your response should be of God.

0:36:09.260,0:36:15.220
You can never hear me respond to any issue because I know how God works.

0:36:15.220,0:36:27.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:27.500,0:36:36.520
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:36:36.520,0:36:42.000
God gives dream to guide us in this life.

0:36:42.000,0:36:48.060
For this life, you need guidance.

0:36:48.060,0:36:53.920
"You will dream, dream, dream!" - that is the book of Joel.

0:36:53.920,0:36:58.400
But how many of you dream today?

0:36:58.400,0:37:03.440
Before even coming here, you are supposed to actually know what my appearance will be -

0:37:03.440,0:37:07.320
what kind of wears I will put on, and you will see it clearly.

0:37:07.320,0:37:11.660
By the time you see clear, you say, "Oh! This is actually what I saw it in the dream!"

0:37:11.660,0:37:16.580
to tell you, "Oh, yes. Today is your day!"

0:37:16.580,0:37:23.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:23.900,0:37:26.260
It is everywhere. It is with you.

0:37:26.260,0:37:28.860
It is for you. It is a gift.

0:37:28.860,0:37:34.940
You are born with it. Your dream is only dormant, unused - it is there.

0:37:34.940,0:37:37.920
So you take this message home today:

0:37:37.920,0:37:41.920
Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:37:41.920,0:37:56.560
Anytime you are having a challenge, think over it - the position of God - before you comment.

0:37:56.560,0:38:02.960
When someone lies against you, sit back.

0:38:02.960,0:38:09.360
Know the position of God before you comment.

0:38:09.360,0:38:16.780
When temptation comes, what is God's position?

0:38:16.780,0:38:21.440
All this divorce, divorce, divorce, everywhere broken home.

0:38:21.440,0:38:28.700
If you take time to know God's position, you will know that for 90% of this, God is aware.

0:38:28.700,0:38:37.260
God used this for a purpose - to preserve, to cleanse the house,

0:38:37.260,0:38:50.340
to separate them from unclean and impure.

0:38:50.340,0:39:09.220
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:39:09.220,0:39:26.120
Because Jesus is Lord over your life, see your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:39:26.120,0:39:36.040
When you see your dream, you know God's position concerning your affliction, burden,

0:39:36.040,0:39:47.860
God's position concerning what you are going through, challenges, situation, condition.

0:39:47.860,0:39:53.160
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:39:53.160,0:39:55.980
You need to know God's position

0:39:55.980,0:40:03.360
because oftentimes, He works through the circumstances of life.

0:40:03.360,0:40:09.220
You know how He helped Joseph in adverse circumstances.

0:40:09.220,0:40:17.380
He helped Joseph. Look at the history of Joseph.

0:40:17.380,0:40:23.040
He was with Joseph, and you with God are majority.

0:40:23.040,0:40:33.140
See your dream, in the name of Jesus!

0:40:33.140,0:40:37.740
One thing we don't know about our enemy:

0:40:37.740,0:40:44.860
When they hit you, trying to attack you, and you are silent,

0:40:44.860,0:40:48.180
it creates fear to your enemy.

0:40:48.180,0:40:51.200
They will not know your position.

0:40:51.200,0:40:54.280
And they don't know what you mean by your silence.

0:40:54.280,0:40:58.640
But when you respond - they love response.

0:40:58.640,0:41:00.640
"Please, this is a secret!"

0:41:00.640,0:41:05.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:41:05.900,0:41:23.580
Tell your neighbour, "Your enemy loves your response. It gives them the next strategy to use.

0:41:23.580,0:41:28.040
When they kick you, shout at you, lie against you, and you come out to say,

0:41:28.040,0:41:32.100
"You lie against me!", they say, "Glory!". They are happy.

0:41:32.100,0:41:35.400
"He, we hit him! Hit him more!"

0:41:35.400,0:41:36.900
"He, he!"

0:41:36.900,0:41:38.600
"Oh, hit him more!"

0:41:38.600,0:41:40.440
The same way satan:

0:41:40.440,0:41:46.600
When you want to pray and you begin to say, "Satan, satan!",

0:41:46.600,0:41:49.520
satan will be happy. He always wants attention.

0:41:49.520,0:41:52.640
He want to hear the word 'satan' in your mouth.

0:41:52.640,0:41:57.760
He wants you to confess, talk about him.

0:41:57.760,0:41:59.900
When you don't talk about him, you just ignore him,

0:41:59.900,0:42:04.600
you are not even mentioning anything about him, it is always very painful to him.

0:42:04.600,0:42:06.840
Satan loves attention.

0:42:06.840,0:42:09.380
That is why I used to tell some of our members

0:42:09.380,0:42:16.260
when people are in a prayer mode and you now stand up, showing your shoes, stuff and all that,

0:42:16.260,0:42:19.340
I said they should help me in giving the names of people like that.

0:42:19.340,0:42:21.340
Satan is using them.

0:42:21.340,0:42:26.260
That is when they want to show off their stuff, attire, beauty,

0:42:26.260,0:42:31.900
you will see them moving around the church at a time people are quiet.

0:42:31.900,0:42:35.600
Satan likes attention.

0:42:35.600,0:42:41.560
When you ignore satan - you see me the way I ignore satan.

0:42:41.560,0:42:44.280
There is nothing you will say, unless God says, "Talk!"

0:42:44.280,0:42:49.080
When you just say something, I will be looking. I want to know God's position.

0:42:49.080,0:42:54.920
Even if God could not give me a response instantly, I'm always patient

0:42:54.920,0:43:01.640
because there is nothing I will gain in responding.

0:43:01.640,0:43:07.520
Because I depend on God's ability and power than man's majority.

0:43:07.520,0:43:15.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:15.000,0:43:21.040
God's authority is final.

0:43:21.040,0:43:26.900
You know, you need support...

0:43:26.900,0:43:30.020
So please, take note of that.

0:43:30.020,0:43:33.520
Your enemy loves your response.

0:43:33.520,0:43:38.240
That gives them next strategy and tactic to use.

0:43:38.240,0:43:44.240
When you don't respond, and they abuse, and curse you, whatever they say about you,

0:43:44.240,0:43:48.720
and you don't respond, that is the end of the matter.

0:43:48.720,0:43:54.640
Overflow Congregation

0:43:54.640,0:43:56.800
Yes, that is their end.

0:43:56.800,0:44:01.780
But that is not God's end. Where they stop, God starts.

0:44:01.780,0:44:07.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:44:07.940,0:44:09.240
So that is it.

0:44:09.240,0:44:15.420
From your response, they know how mighty, little, big you are.

0:44:15.420,0:44:18.660
When you talk, the enemy listens to your voice.

0:44:18.660,0:44:23.760
From your voice, they know the value of what you are saying.

0:44:23.760,0:44:29.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:44:29.320,0:44:33.280
Yes. So take note of this from today.

0:44:33.280,0:44:38.480
Your enemy needs your response. That is why they attack you.

0:44:38.480,0:44:42.280
And when you are quiet, they don't know what you are doing.

0:44:42.280,0:44:47.920
They are afraid. Your silence is very dangerous.

0:44:47.920,0:44:52.020
They too know God. It is only that they don't believe.

0:44:52.020,0:44:58.520
So when you are quiet, they are afraid that "Hey, this man might be migthy in the spirit"

0:44:58.520,0:45:01.440
because they know that you are a spirit man.

0:45:01.440,0:45:03.140
Are you not a spirit man?

0:45:03.140,0:45:05.420
[Yes!]

0:45:05.420,0:45:06.900
Does the spirit talk?

0:45:06.900,0:45:08.020
[No!]

0:45:08.020,0:45:09.840
Eh hen.

0:45:09.840,0:45:11.660
So take this home today.

0:45:11.660,0:45:18.800
In summary, your enemy needs your response for attack.

0:45:18.800,0:45:23.160
To attack you next, they need your response.

0:45:23.160,0:45:29.180
So, take note.

0:45:29.180,0:45:40.280
When you don't respond, it means you have a big God who is fighting for you.

0:45:40.280,0:45:50.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:45:50.000,0:45:56.320
Every response of your enemy, take it God - take it for prayer.

0:45:56.320,0:46:01.360
If your enemy says, "You are a thief", write it down, take it to your altar.

0:46:01.360,0:46:05.080
If your enemy says, "You are stupid", write it down, take it to your altar.

0:46:05.080,0:46:08.860
Don't use your mouth to reply. Take it to your altar.

0:46:08.860,0:46:14.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:14.140,0:46:17.340
By the time you have written down all the response of your enemy -

0:46:17.340,0:46:20.840
"I will kill you; I will destroy you" - just write everything down with the date.

0:46:20.840,0:46:26.180
"They will kill you; they will destroy you" - write it down and take it to the altar of God and say,

0:46:26.180,0:46:35.520
"I am a spirit; I am only living in a physical body, learning to live in this physical world".

0:46:35.520,0:46:37.020
So, what else again?

0:46:37.020,0:46:40.800
Take it to the altar of God.

0:46:40.800,0:46:50.260
Two: Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.

0:46:50.260,0:46:53.340
Your adverse circumstances.

0:46:53.340,0:46:58.100
Oftentimes, many times.

0:46:58.100,0:47:05.240
These adverse circumstances you see as an attack from the enemy, from this, from that -

0:47:05.240,0:47:22.980
mighty God is using them for cleansing; to separate you from unclean and impure elements.

0:47:22.980,0:47:28.560
That you are silent and quiet does not mean that you are a Christian.

0:47:28.560,0:47:37.540
Very gentle, wearing rag - it does not mean that you are a child of God.

0:47:37.540,0:47:41.640
Christisnity lies in the heart.

0:47:41.640,0:47:49.000
What does your heart say?

0:47:49.000,0:47:51.280
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:47:51.280,0:47:57.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:47:57.320,0:48:03.080
Give me a greater understanding of Your heart - that should be your prayer today.

0:48:03.080,0:48:05.480
That should be going on in your heart.

0:48:05.480,0:48:15.880
Give me a greater understanding of Your heart because Jesus is Lord over my life.

0:48:15.880,0:48:26.220
Because You are Lord over my life, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.

0:48:26.220,0:48:28.620
So, this is what you need now.

0:48:28.620,0:48:35.260
"Give me a greater understanding of Your heart" because you don't understand God's heart.

0:48:35.260,0:48:40.420
That is why when attack comes, you attack back, the same way.

0:48:40.420,0:48:46.600
And you never knew that oftentimes, the person that attacks you does not matter

0:48:46.600,0:48:50.480
but the position of God concerning the attack matters.

0:48:50.480,0:48:58.260
Tell your neighbour, "Oftentimes, the person that attacks me does not matter

0:48:58.260,0:49:03.520
but the position of God concerning that attack matters".

0:49:03.520,0:49:04.760
Yes, that is it.

0:49:04.760,0:49:07.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:49:07.080,0:49:13.780
If Judas was not sent to betray Jesus and Jesus was not crucified,

0:49:13.780,0:49:18.640
today, we would not talk of the Saviour.

0:49:18.640,0:49:22.840
The person that attacked me, oftentimes, does not matter.

0:49:22.840,0:49:26.020
When you just say, "Ah, you attacked me!" - I look at him.

0:49:26.020,0:49:34.180
He does not even matter; he is being used to take you to the throne.

0:49:34.180,0:49:42.580
Many a time, the attacker is being used to take you to the throne.

0:49:42.580,0:49:48.360
He does not matter; he is just being used.

0:49:48.360,0:49:49.820
He is a particle.

0:49:49.820,0:49:53.720
But the position of God concerning that attack matters.

0:49:53.720,0:49:56.400
"What is Your position, God, concerning this attack?"

0:49:56.400,0:50:03.500
"Oh yes, this position is to cleanse and preserve you for the new level!

0:50:03.500,0:50:10.160
It is to strengthen your desire and your determination for me, God!"

0:50:10.160,0:50:19.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:50:19.200,0:50:22.120
So, these are the things we need to know.

0:50:22.120,0:50:27.000
Please, don't waste your time over your enemy

0:50:27.000,0:50:36.600
because he uses the content of your words to strategise.

0:50:36.600,0:50:38.240
"I will deal with you!"

0:50:38.240,0:50:39.180
"Eh hen!"

0:50:39.180,0:50:45.120
He wants to see those behindg you.

0:50:45.120,0:50:49.280
Silence is the best answer for a fool.

0:50:49.280,0:50:55.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:50:55.860,0:50:59.460
Silence is the best answer for your enemy.

0:50:59.460,0:51:00.520
Write it down.

0:51:00.520,0:51:06.100
Silence is the best answer for my enemy.

0:51:06.100,0:51:08.680
Yes.

0:51:08.680,0:51:17.920
Silence is the best answer for my enemy.

0:51:17.920,0:51:22.840
Nothing makes you better than your enemy when you respond.

0:51:22.840,0:51:28.240
Nothing makes me better than my enemy when I respond.

0:51:28.240,0:51:30.460
"You are an idiot!" - "You too are an idiot!"

0:51:30.460,0:51:34.260
What makes you better now?

0:51:34.260,0:51:36.460
Who is now an enemy?

0:51:36.460,0:51:38.000
The two of you.

0:51:38.000,0:51:41.280
The two of you are now an enemy of God.

0:51:41.280,0:51:43.980
"You are an idiot!" - "You too are an idiot!"

0:51:43.980,0:51:48.560
Who is now the Christian among you?

0:51:48.560,0:51:55.000
Nothing makes me better when I respond.

0:51:55.000,0:51:59.260
The attacker does not matter many times

0:51:59.260,0:52:04.900
but the position of God concerning the attack matters.

0:52:04.900,0:52:06.260
Thank you.
