GOD HAS ORDERED ALL

0:00:16.400,0:00:24.220
It is time you should be a producer not a consumer.

0:00:24.220,0:00:31.880
Tell your neighbour, 'Be a producer, not a consumer'.

0:00:31.880,0:00:38.880
This is the problem we are facing in our continent Africa.

0:00:38.880,0:00:40.560
What is it?

0:00:40.560,0:00:44.680
Instead of using our mineral resources to exchange technology,

0:00:44.680,0:00:52.180
we use it to exchange dollars and pounds.

0:00:52.180,0:00:56.080
Instead of using the mineral resources the Lord has given us,

0:00:56.080,0:00:59.760
and take it, "Hey, you need something from me?

0:00:59.760,0:01:03.160
We Africa, we carry our property, our mineral resources.

0:01:03.160,0:01:07.320
Instead of giving them and using it to receive the technology they have,

0:01:07.320,0:01:10.740
we give them and receive dollars and pounds.

0:01:10.740,0:01:15.860
We keep...

0:01:15.860,0:01:21.580
If we used these mineral resources to get technology,

0:01:21.580,0:01:24.200
nobody would embezzle money.

0:01:24.200,0:01:30.000
If there was a law that these mineral resources should not be exchanged for dollars and pounds,

0:01:30.000,0:01:33.400
but rather for technology - when I want to give something to America,

0:01:33.400,0:01:36.240
I will look at what they are good at in technology.

0:01:36.240,0:01:49.280
Give me your technology, let me give you my oil. The corruption would come to an end.

0:01:49.280,0:02:03.400
In Nigeria, for example, we have oil. Then, if in Nigeria there was a law that if any country needed this oil,

0:02:03.400,0:02:08.460
we would need to check what the other country's technology or mineral resources are.

0:02:08.460,0:02:15.700
Our own is oil - if there was a law that they give their mineral resources

0:02:15.700,0:02:19.220
while we equally give our own mineral resources, no money would be exchanged.

0:02:19.220,0:02:24.380
The country today would become a pilgrimage.

0:02:24.380,0:02:29.620
But today, what is happening to the dollars and pounds we receive?

0:02:29.620,0:02:36.860
So, Africa and other countries that are complaining that they are poor, you are not poor.

0:02:36.860,0:02:42.780
It is only that you exchange your mineral resources with dollars and pounds.

0:02:42.780,0:02:47.580
We say there is no employment, there is no job for the youths. Why?

0:02:47.580,0:02:53.180
Because dollars and pounds are not a company.

0:02:53.180,0:03:01.340
But if we use our mineral resources to exchange to receive technology from overseas,

0:03:01.340,0:03:12.080
jobs would be everywhere. The youths would have a job.

0:03:12.080,0:03:18.520
When we need money, we can sell and buy yam, cocoyam, and all other stuffs to get money.

0:03:18.520,0:03:24.500
But oil, gold, and all other mineral resources God has given you,

0:03:24.500,0:03:28.220
should not be exchanged with money.

0:03:28.220,0:03:33.280
It should not be oil for money, but oil for technology.

0:03:33.280,0:03:39.680
Say, 'Not oil for money, oil for technology'.

0:03:39.680,0:03:47.840
Tell the whole world: 'Not oil for money,  oil for technology'.

0:03:47.840,0:03:59.800
GOD HAS ORDERED ALL
