Listen to what he has to say.

0:00:09.440,0:00:15.500
As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, see beyond your palace.

T.B. Joshua Spent The Beginning
Of The New Year At The Prayer Mountain

0:01:16.820,0:01:21.920
Viewers all over the world, Happy New Year!

0:01:21.920,0:01:31.080
I know you want to know anywhere I am, from time to time, as a man of the people.

0:01:31.080,0:01:38.880
I have been here for the past three days.

0:01:38.880,0:01:43.840
I am here because I know where I need to grow.

0:01:43.840,0:01:50.260
When we know where we need to grow, it is victory itself.

0:01:50.260,0:01:53.480
I want to pray with you.

0:01:53.480,0:01:59.520
Whatever hinders you to greatness -

0:01:59.520,0:02:10.380
it could be your weaknesses, it could be generational curses, I mean, inherited curses.

0:02:10.380,0:02:22.880
Whatever hinders you to greatness, begin to give way, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:22.880,0:02:29.320
You inherited curses, I say, give way and leave my people!

0:02:29.320,0:02:40.900
You weaknesses, bad habits in whatever way, give way, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:40.900,0:02:43.860
I remove you, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:43.860,0:02:54.040
You need a clean heart to enjoy your New Year - a right spirit within you to enjoy your New Year.

0:02:54.040,0:03:01.860
I say, whatever hinders you to greatness, give way, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:01.860,0:03:07.040
Right now, give way, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:07.040,0:03:11.640
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:03:11.640,0:03:21.840
Viewers all over the world, I like being one with nature -

0:03:21.840,0:03:32.820
where there are no disturbances, where we don't need to close our eyes to pray.

0:03:32.820,0:03:36.300
That is why I'm here; it is my habit.

0:03:36.300,0:03:40.300
That does not mean you should come to the mountain like this.

0:03:40.300,0:03:44.060
It is my habit; habit is a gift from God.

0:03:44.060,0:03:48.660
I developed this habit right from the beginning of my ministry.

0:03:48.660,0:03:51.600
When you look at my documentary, it has been like that.

0:03:51.600,0:03:56.980
When I need a quiet place, I run to the wilderness, to the mountain.

0:03:56.980,0:03:59.660
It has been my habit, right from the beginning.

0:03:59.660,0:04:01.480
It is a habit.

0:04:01.480,0:04:05.640
That does not mean you as Christians should also do the same.

0:04:05.640,0:04:12.540
You should also develop your habit; habit is a gift from God.

0:04:12.540,0:04:22.680
I am here to know the mind of God

0:04:22.680,0:04:31.000
concerning this fearful year, 2019 - very, very fearful.

0:04:31.000,0:04:36.040
I am here to know the mind of God concerning this fearful year

0:04:36.040,0:04:41.460
and also to pray for you and the world at large.

0:04:41.460,0:04:44.060
That is why I am here - heart to heart.

0:04:44.060,0:04:46.700
My viewers all over the world - heart to heart.

0:04:46.700,0:04:50.840
This is issue of heart.

0:04:50.840,0:04:53.820
Give me your heart; let us pray once again.

0:04:53.820,0:05:05.620
Whatever that does not reflect Jesus in your life, be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:05.620,0:05:08.400
And begin to receive a clean heart.

0:05:08.400,0:05:13.500
Be removed, in the name of Jesus and begin to receive a right spirit within you.

0:05:13.500,0:05:17.960
Whatever that does not reflect Jesus, be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:17.960,0:05:20.280
I remove them, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:20.280,0:05:28.160
Be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:28.160,0:05:34.460
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:05:34.460,0:05:40.460
Whatever that does not reflect Jesus, be removed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:40.460,0:05:42.560
Be cleansed, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:42.560,0:05:47.200
Be cleansed and receive a right spirit right now, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:47.200,0:05:53.720
Be cleansed and receive a clean heart, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:53.720,0:05:55.280
Thank You, Lord.

0:05:55.280,0:06:00.840
In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.

0:06:00.840,0:06:02.580
Thank you.

0:06:02.580,0:06:08.260
I will be leaving today; I have been here for the past few days.

0:06:08.260,0:06:15.260
This is why Jesus gave me the grace to speak to you so that you would know where I am.

0:06:15.260,0:06:17.160
Thank You, Jesus.

0:06:17.160,0:06:18.940
Good Morning, viewers!

0:06:18.940,0:06:21.280
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:06:21.280,0:06:23.220
Amen.
