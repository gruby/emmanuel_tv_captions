The Bible says prophets are sent to utter the deep things of God for the conviction of sin,

0:00:05.720,0:00:10.520
for edification and comfort to the people of God.

0:00:10.520,0:00:18.200
Prophet T.B. Joshua is used by God to speak words of prophecy into peoples lives, exposing and destroying

0:00:18.200,0:00:22.440
the plan of satan against them, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:22.440,0:00:29.140
As the man of God was ministering, the power of God fell upon this lady and her deliverance began.

0:00:29.140,0:00:34.980
Let's watch what happened next, as the name of Jesus Christ worked in the spirit.

0:00:34.980,0:00:37.660
Stand up!

0:00:37.660,0:00:39.100
Leave her.

0:00:39.100,0:00:41.240
Stand up!

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:51.440,0:00:56.320
I destroyed her.

0:00:56.320,0:00:57.000
She is your daughter?

0:00:57.000,0:00:57.880
Yes.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:16.980,0:01:20.680
I am her spiritual husband.

0:01:20.680,0:01:22.620
I have scattered everything about her.

0:01:22.620,0:01:26.500
Go and stand with your daughter.

0:01:26.500,0:01:30.020
She does not know anything.

0:01:30.020,0:01:32.500
I don’t want her to be great.

0:01:32.500,0:01:34.180
I have destroyed her.

0:01:34.180,0:01:37.460
[How have you destroyed her?]

0:01:37.460,0:01:40.080
She does not know anything.

0:01:40.080,0:01:42.820
I have scattered her destiny.

0:01:42.820,0:01:43.920
You listen to that?

0:01:43.920,0:01:45.500
Destiny has been scattered.

0:01:45.500,0:01:48.380
Nothing.

0:01:48.380,0:01:51.120
She does not know anything.

0:01:51.120,0:01:55.160
She is over; she is finished.

0:01:55.160,0:01:59.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:59.080,0:02:06.280
I just want to destroy her because her star is great.

0:02:06.280,0:02:10.320
Come on, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:10.320,0:02:13.840
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:02:13.840,0:02:18.620
Come here!

When I count to two - your knee on the floor!

0:02:23.100,0:02:27.780
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:02:27.780,0:02:29.300
Leave her like that.

0:02:29.300,0:02:35.340
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:02:35.340,0:02:37.500
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:37.500,0:02:41.660
She is free.

0:02:41.660,0:02:48.800
The Holy Spirit casts the demon out and she is given a new heart and desire to follow Jesus Christ.

0:02:48.800,0:02:51.360
Her deliverance is complete.

0:02:51.360,0:02:53.140
Hallelujah.

0:02:53.140,0:02:59.760
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:59.760,0:03:04.480
My name is Joana Agboga, I am from Edo State but I reside in Abuja.

0:03:04.480,0:03:06.020
I'm a student.

0:03:06.020,0:03:12.600
I came to thank God for delivering me from the evil spirit that caused me to bedwet,

0:03:12.600,0:03:19.880
steal, lie, be angry and very stubborn.

0:03:19.880,0:03:26.940
I started bedwetting from when I was small.

0:03:26.940,0:03:31.780
When I would bedwet, I'd wake up and feel that the bed was wet and stand up.

0:03:31.780,0:03:35.140
Most times, I would cry and tell my mum.

0:03:35.140,0:03:37.420
It was every night.

0:03:37.420,0:03:41.100
It had been happening on a day to day basis.

0:03:41.100,0:03:45.860
As for the stealing, I would go to a supermarket with a huge sum of money

0:03:45.860,0:03:50.860
but pick up something worth 50 or 20 naira and leave.

0:03:50.860,0:03:53.320
I would not use it.

0:03:53.320,0:03:58.020
I would just take it and throw it away; sometimes, I would keep it.

0:03:58.020,0:04:02.020
I had the spirit of anger.

0:04:02.020,0:04:06.640
I used to get angry at any little thing.

0:04:06.640,0:04:10.220
When I got angry, I would bang the door on my mum.

0:04:10.220,0:04:14.260
If someone hid money in the house, something would tell me where the money was.

0:04:14.260,0:04:18.860
I would go there and get the money no matter where they hid it.

0:04:18.860,0:04:23.420
The evil spirit would tell me where the money was and I would steal it.

0:04:23.420,0:04:32.480
The lack of knowledge: before exams, I would read but during the exams, everything would black out.

0:04:32.480,0:04:35.680
Tell me, what other evil things remain?

0:04:35.680,0:04:38.180
Look - what a beautiful girl.

0:04:38.180,0:04:44.300
She is bedwetting all the time, she steals...

0:04:44.300,0:04:47.880
She can enter the supermarket and steal something.

0:04:47.880,0:04:52.540
When she sleeps she bedwetts everywhere, all the time!

0:04:52.540,0:04:57.700
She can't travel, she can't go anywhere, she steals...

0:04:57.700,0:05:00.140
The bedwetting had affected me in many ways.

0:05:00.140,0:05:05.560
I could not go to my sister's house and ask to stay or go to my cousin's house.

0:05:05.560,0:05:09.760
I could not go anywhere because of the bedwetting.

0:05:09.760,0:05:15.240
I was always not happy, which was not a good thing at all.

0:05:15.240,0:05:21.560
This stealing - does it mean that your parents are poor and that is why you steal,

0:05:21.560,0:05:24.900
or it was something you could not resist?

0:05:24.900,0:05:26.700
Tell us.

0:05:26.700,0:05:30.320
My mum and dad gave me whatever I wanted.

0:05:30.320,0:05:37.460
I would go to the supermarket with a huge sum of money but pick something worth 10 or 20 naira.

0:05:37.460,0:05:39.860
How this thing comes to you?

0:05:39.860,0:05:46.140
The voice would direct me to go, that I would not be caught stealing.

0:05:46.140,0:05:47.560
There is a voice?

0:05:47.560,0:05:48.680
Yes, Sir.

0:05:48.680,0:05:49.600
You listen to that.

0:05:49.600,0:05:55.060
She said her parents gave her everything, more than what was stolen.

0:05:55.060,0:05:58.220
They have enough.

0:05:58.220,0:06:05.020
Even if she had 10 000 naira or 5 000 dollars in the pocket

0:06:05.020,0:06:10.420
she would still enter the supermarket and steal 1 dollar.

0:06:10.420,0:06:12.840
Does it make sense?

0:06:12.840,0:06:23.100
Tell your neighbour, "if you fail to realise that there are powers that cause one

0:06:23.100,0:06:35.200
to be bowed down in bondage, you will fight the wrong battle."

0:06:35.200,0:06:46.440
Now, she has 5 000 but you will see her going to the supermarket and taking 1 dollar.

0:06:46.440,0:06:51.400
What does she want to use 1 dollar for - somebody who has 5 000 dollars in the pocket?

0:06:51.400,0:06:52.880
What does she want to use it for?

0:06:52.880,0:07:01.700
That is to tell you that this is beyond human comprehension.

0:07:01.700,0:07:07.680
Ordinarily it is beyond...

0:07:07.680,0:07:11.940
There is a force that wants her to be humiliated.

0:07:11.940,0:07:15.360
There is a force that wants her to be embarrassed.

0:07:15.360,0:07:18.240
There is a force that wants her to be killed.

0:07:18.240,0:07:21.080
There is a force that wants her to be imprisoned.

0:07:21.080,0:07:24.220
There is a force that wants her to be out of circulation.

0:07:24.220,0:07:27.020
If I am talking to you let me see your hand.

0:07:27.020,0:07:30.880
There is a force.

0:07:30.880,0:07:32.480
You have to stand against it.

0:07:32.480,0:07:33.040
Stand up!

0:07:33.040,0:07:38.360
Tell your neighbour, "There is a force that wants you to be disgraced.

0:07:38.360,0:07:43.040
There is a force that wants you to be condemned.

0:07:43.040,0:07:47.360
There is a force that wants you to be imprisoned.

0:07:47.360,0:07:52.300
You have to stand against it, in the name of Jesus!

0:07:52.300,0:08:08.680
If you fail to realise that there are powers that make people to be humiliated, to be embarrassed,

0:08:08.680,0:08:12.140
you will fight a wrong battle."

0:08:12.140,0:08:17.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:17.700,0:08:21.200
You may be seated.

0:08:21.200,0:08:23.160
There are two ways;

0:08:23.160,0:08:33.020
bedwetting to embarrass her among her colleagues, to humiliate her, to make her feel inferior.

0:08:33.020,0:08:37.420
She would not be able to talk to colleagues that know she was bedwetting.

0:08:37.420,0:08:45.320
I was in a boarding school and I would wet the bed but my classmates would cover up for me.

0:08:45.320,0:08:47.940
Every time I urinated, something would wake me that I should stand up.

0:08:47.940,0:08:52.100
Then, I would turn over that mattress and leave the room.

0:08:52.100,0:08:55.040
I didn’t like watching Emmanuel TV at all.

0:08:55.040,0:08:57.080
Whenever Emmanuel TV was on, I was not happy.

0:08:57.080,0:09:00.520
I would leave the room.

0:09:00.520,0:09:03.800
My mum had to force me to come here today.

0:09:03.800,0:09:09.380
You said you bedwetted in the boarding school and your classmates knew about this, didn't you?

0:09:09.380,0:09:10.180
Yes, Sir.

0:09:10.180,0:09:11.600
What were they saying?

0:09:11.600,0:09:18.520
Most of them would say different things; like, in the hostel, I was not able to go to their rooms.

0:09:18.520,0:09:22.040
If we were doing something in any of their rooms, I could not sleep over;

0:09:22.040,0:09:23.540
I would have to come back to my room.

0:09:23.540,0:09:27.740
Most of them would insult me; it was very embarrassing.

0:09:27.740,0:09:31.080
Now you say that you did not want to watch Emmanuel TV. Why?

0:09:31.080,0:09:38.020
Each time they put Emmanuel TV on, I would leave the room and go and listen to music or watch a movie.

0:09:38.020,0:09:45.140
Those who refuse to watch Emmanuel TV in your houses - you should know the reason why.

0:09:45.140,0:09:47.920
The sister has revealed - this is a revelation.

0:09:47.920,0:09:52.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:52.960,0:09:58.740
Listen, those who don't want to see people healed...

0:09:58.740,0:10:03.860
"In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk!" - there are people that do not want to see that kind of things.

0:10:03.860,0:10:11.800
Those who do not want to see people being helped, by giving food, charity, assistance, scholarships -

0:10:11.800,0:10:12.800
they don't want to see it.

0:10:12.800,0:10:18.640
They would say, "This is fake. How can you give this thing? Where did they get the money?

0:10:18.640,0:10:21.620
By what authority is this healing of people?"

0:10:21.620,0:10:25.740
If I am talking...

0:10:25.740,0:10:27.880
Whatever authority...

0:10:27.880,0:10:30.740
I'm talking to you - by what authority are you healing people?

0:10:30.740,0:10:32.020
I doubt that power.

0:10:32.020,0:10:37.360
Me that is talking - what am I using this authority to do?

0:10:37.360,0:10:44.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:44.220,0:10:49.260
She is telling you that she hated watching Emmanuel TV.

0:10:49.260,0:10:59.380
This is someone who in the past was bedwetting, stealing, because she didn't want to see

0:10:59.380,0:11:03.140
someone being delivered from stealing.

0:11:03.140,0:11:05.740
It made her feel irritated.

0:11:05.740,0:11:09.540
This is what I am doing - I steal.

0:11:09.540,0:11:16.240
If I now watch on TV someone confessing, "I am a thief" and this person would hear, "You are delivered".

0:11:16.240,0:11:18.720
And this person would later confirm that the spirit was gone.

0:11:18.720,0:11:23.900
Being a thief, I would feel very condemned and worried.

0:11:23.900,0:11:27.260
I wouldn't want to watch more, if I am not ready to stop stealing.

0:11:27.260,0:11:31.260
If I am talking to you...

0:11:31.260,0:11:33.900
I would not be able to sleep that night.

0:11:33.900,0:11:35.540
I would continue to think about it.

0:11:35.540,0:11:39.640
It is better that I do not hear people talking about stealing, being delivered from stealing,

0:11:39.640,0:11:41.680
because I'm there.

0:11:41.680,0:11:43.660
Can you see?

0:11:43.660,0:11:49.800
Or, I bedwet everyday, but watching Emmanuel TV one would see somebody

0:11:49.800,0:11:55.680
being delivered from a spirit of bedwetting.

0:11:55.680,0:11:59.940
And I am not ready to come out to say people that I bedwet.

0:11:59.940,0:12:02.500
The thing would worry me; I would not be able to sleep.

0:12:02.500,0:12:05.220
It would become a burden to my spirit.

0:12:05.220,0:12:07.780
It is better for me not to watch such a program.

0:12:07.780,0:12:16.780
It is better for me to watch a movie or a program where I would see people proud to be thief, to be this or that.

0:12:16.780,0:12:18.740
That would encourage my spirit.

0:12:18.740,0:12:24.540
It is better not to watch anything that would not encourage my spirit.

0:12:24.540,0:12:28.580
My mum forced me to come to SCOAN.

0:12:28.580,0:12:30.160
They forced you to come here?

0:12:30.160,0:12:31.300
Yes, sir.

0:12:31.300,0:12:33.480
How?

0:12:33.480,0:12:38.760
Before she booked the flight, I told my mum that I didn’t want to come.

0:12:38.760,0:12:40.860
She told me that I must come.

0:12:40.860,0:12:42.040
I said, "Mummy, I don’t want to come".

0:12:42.040,0:12:44.080
She said, "You must come".
She forced me.

0:12:44.080,0:12:47.520
When we got to the airport, they told us that we had missed the flight

0:12:47.520,0:12:52.600
but my mum begged them, that we couldn't miss the flight.

0:12:52.600,0:12:55.320
She then paid extra money and we came here.

0:12:55.320,0:13:04.520
When we got here for the Saturday service, under the canopy is where my mum was sat.

0:13:04.520,0:13:09.860
I left her there and walked around but didn't want to enter the church.

0:13:09.860,0:13:15.020
Then, she came inside the main auditorium and I followed her inside.

0:13:15.020,0:13:20.420
Prophet T.B. Joshua located me where I had sat down and told me to stand up.

0:13:20.420,0:13:23.480
Then, the evil spirit in me started manifesting.

0:13:23.480,0:13:29.580
Since my deliverance, I have been free – no spirit telling me to steal, I have not bedwet – nothing.

0:13:29.580,0:13:33.220
I sleep and wake up peacefully.

0:13:33.220,0:13:38.460
Now, remember that she was not the one I was talking to.

0:13:38.460,0:13:44.920
I was talking to the forth person next to her.

0:13:44.920,0:13:46.220
Come on, brother.

0:13:46.220,0:13:51.760
When I'm talking to this brother, everyone around is being observed.

0:13:51.760,0:14:11.440
Everybody around, because Jesus has eyes at the back as good as those in the front.

0:14:11.440,0:14:13.460
So, where can you go from His presence?

0:14:13.460,0:14:14.960
[Nowhere.]

0:14:14.960,0:14:23.760
So, when I located this sister, I was in hurry to leave this brother and go to her.

0:14:23.760,0:14:25.180
OK, sit down.

0:14:25.180,0:14:30.520
Christianity and religion -

0:14:30.520,0:14:34.740
some people don't know the difference between Christianity and religion.

0:14:34.740,0:14:36.120
There is a difference.

0:14:36.120,0:14:43.560
Religious people are without spirituality

0:14:43.560,0:14:52.900
while Christians are born of the Spirit of God.

0:14:52.900,0:14:59.280
We are made in our heart to be Christians.

0:14:59.280,0:15:12.920
We are only made Christians by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.

0:15:12.920,0:15:22.020
Tell your neighbour, “We are made in our heart to be Christians”.

0:15:22.020,0:15:24.040
In other words, I mean:

0:15:24.040,0:15:35.820
we are only made Christians by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.

0:15:35.820,0:15:42.500
Ever since the man of God delivered me, I have been free; I have not bedwetted.

0:15:42.500,0:15:45.620
I have not done anything, no evil spirit has told me anything.

0:15:45.620,0:15:48.700
I just sleep and wake up peacefully.

0:15:48.700,0:15:51.800
I no longer steal or bedwet.

0:15:51.800,0:15:55.000
Man of God, I thank you so much for what you have done in my life.

0:15:55.000,0:15:57.940
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:15:57.940,0:16:01.980
I am so happy to be here, in your midst today.

0:16:01.980,0:16:10.700
My name is Mrs. Elizabeth Agboga, I am from Edo State, I reside in Abuja.

0:16:10.700,0:16:14.720
This girl beside me is my daughter.

0:16:14.720,0:16:20.800
She had been bedwetting since she was five years old.

0:16:20.800,0:16:30.760
When we came from Abuja to The SCOAN, she bedwet in the hotel that we lodged in.

0:16:30.760,0:16:32.680
Are you listening to that?

0:16:32.680,0:16:34.880
Can you see what a foolish thing?

0:16:34.880,0:16:39.500
God has taken it just like that - by His stripes.

0:16:39.500,0:16:44.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:44.600,0:16:51.120
Why there would be anyone not recognizing His death on the Calvary?

0:16:51.120,0:16:53.100
Just like that.

0:16:53.100,0:16:55.900
Tell your neighbour, "You need to be delivered."

0:16:55.900,0:17:01.020
Because it is the Spirit of prophet that recognises a prophet.

0:17:01.020,0:17:04.220
You cannot recognise things we are talking about.

0:17:04.220,0:17:13.620
The greatest miracle that can happen to anyone is when you begin to see what Jesus is looking at,

0:17:13.620,0:17:17.600
to go where Jesus wants you to go

0:17:17.600,0:17:24.680
and begin to look at yourself... seeing yourself having what Jesus says you have, being able to do things

0:17:24.680,0:17:27.140
Jesus says you can do.

0:17:27.140,0:17:29.040
That is the greatest miracle.

0:17:29.040,0:17:31.480
The contentment we are talking about will come.

0:17:31.480,0:17:37.500
You are not content - that is why you are running "helter skelter", no matter the miracle you receive.

0:17:37.500,0:17:46.720
Running "helter skelter", living a life of "non-contentment" will rubbish our salvation.

0:17:46.720,0:17:50.600
When you are not content there is nothing you cannot do.

0:17:50.600,0:17:53.240
It is when you are content...

0:17:53.240,0:17:59.200
No matter how little I have - I'm content, it's OK - that is what God wants me to have.

0:17:59.200,0:18:04.100
God's time is the best - then you will begin to sleep well,

0:18:04.100,0:18:08.560
you will know what to ask for in your prayer,

0:18:08.560,0:18:11.800
then you can say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:18:11.800,0:18:14.800
But when you said "Thank You" the last time?

0:18:14.800,0:18:19.060
When you pray, you do not remember to say "Thank You".

0:18:19.060,0:18:23.700
You only remember an immediate miracle.

0:18:23.700,0:18:29.700
All the miracles you have been receiving right from your youth - you have forgotten them.

0:18:29.700,0:18:31.380
An immediate miracle.

0:18:31.380,0:18:37.300
You are sick now - you forget your good health in the past.

0:18:37.300,0:18:42.520
You are poor now - you forget the time when you lived in abundance.

0:18:42.520,0:18:49.540
You have a nightmare - you forget the vision you have seen in the past.

0:18:49.540,0:18:55.120
Don't wait until you see the light at the end of the tunnel.

0:18:55.120,0:19:04.640
Tell your neighbour, “Don't wait to say, 'Thank You' until you see light at the end of the tunnel".

0:19:04.640,0:19:12.400
You are inside a tunnel and it is dark - "I will not say 'thank You' unless I get to the end".

0:19:12.400,0:19:15.780
Definitely - you will die inside the tunnel.

0:19:15.780,0:19:21.880
Those who get to the end of the tunnel are those who say "Thank You, Jesus" right inside the tunnel.

0:19:21.880,0:19:25.460
"No matter what I'm going through - thank You, Jesus. No matter what happened - thank You, Jesus.

0:19:25.460,0:19:29.620
No matter what is happening to me - thank You, Jesus. I thank You."

0:19:29.620,0:19:32.060
They thank before they get to the end of the tunnel.

0:19:32.060,0:19:38.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:38.400,0:19:42.820
If I'm talking to you...

0:19:42.820,0:19:49.520
While you are inside the tunnel, moving, trying to crawl your body in the dark, you cannot see anything,

0:19:49.520,0:19:50.820
say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:19:50.820,0:19:56.460
Don't begin to say, "See me through".

0:19:56.460,0:19:59.040
No, there is no word of "Thank you", but "See me through".

0:19:59.040,0:20:05.140
Only when you see the light you shout, "Thank You, Jesus - I am going to The SCOAN to give the testimony".

0:20:05.140,0:20:08.700
Coming to The SCOAN to give testimony will be delayed.

0:20:08.700,0:20:15.920
But if right from the beginning of your journey in the dark you keep saying,

0:20:15.920,0:20:18.320
"Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through"...

0:20:18.320,0:20:22.800
Tell your neighbour, "Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through.

0:20:22.800,0:20:25.920
Thank You, Jesus. You have seen me through."

0:20:25.920,0:20:29.540
Whereas you are not yet at the end of the tunnel, you already say,

0:20:29.540,0:20:31.720
"Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through.

0:20:31.720,0:20:33.560
Thank You, Jesus. You have seen me through.

0:20:33.560,0:20:35.400
Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through.

0:20:35.400,0:20:37.240
Thank You, Jesus. You have seen me through.

0:20:37.240,0:20:40.000
Thank You, Jesus. I know You are aware of what I am going through.

0:20:40.000,0:20:43.200
Thank You, Jesus. I know You guide me. Thank You, Jesus."

0:20:43.200,0:20:48.520
These words of thanking should be more then those of asking, "Heal me".

0:20:48.520,0:21:01.240
Tell your neighbour, "The words of thanks should be more than 'Heal me. Deliver me. Set me free.'"

0:21:01.240,0:21:06.120
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:21:06.120,0:21:10.920
If your faith is lifted up let me see your hand.

0:21:10.920,0:21:13.960
I was surprised on Sunday.

0:21:13.960,0:21:17.720
Since then my daughter has not been bedwetting.

0:21:17.720,0:21:21.780
I have been to so many places for deliverance.

0:21:21.780,0:21:32.380
Coming to this place, in just one day the bedwetting, stealing and lying stopped.

0:21:32.380,0:21:34.280
I was so surprised.

0:21:34.280,0:21:39.600
I thank God for everything in my and my children's lives.

0:21:39.600,0:21:49.540
On the last day you will stand to witness how you helped your sister to maintain the miracle.

0:21:49.540,0:22:00.240
Tell your neighbour, "On the last day, she will stand to testify how she supported her daughter

0:22:00.240,0:22:03.420
to maintain the miracle."

0:22:03.420,0:22:06.900
Over to you, my hands are cleansed.

0:22:06.900,0:22:11.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:11.500,0:22:16.980
You have the right over your daughter to say, "Go to the church. Go to the Bible study. Read the Bible.

0:22:16.980,0:22:22.120
Now, you are old enough - go and get married".

0:22:22.120,0:22:28.960
The choice you can make, "Go and get married, you stopped to bedwet - go get married."

0:22:28.960,0:22:31.060
But it is not the next step now.

0:22:31.060,0:22:38.680
The next step for this lady is to have the Word living in her and her living in the Word,

0:22:38.680,0:22:43.460
so that she can maintain the miracle.

0:22:43.460,0:22:46.900
After that - she can get married, she can do whatever she wants to do.

0:22:46.900,0:22:49.500
She has to marry the Word and the Word has to marry her.

0:22:49.500,0:22:56.700
Tell your neighbour, “You have to marry the Word and the Word has to marry you.”

0:22:56.700,0:23:01.420
Before you get married and settle down,

0:23:01.420,0:23:08.240
you must first marry the Word and the Word must marry you.

0:23:08.240,0:23:12.280
That is a sound marriage.

0:23:12.280,0:23:17.720
These are challenges marriages face today.

0:23:17.720,0:23:25.740
Where there is no sound, solid foundation, the marriage crashes.

0:23:25.740,0:23:30.780
Marry and re-marry, broken homes everywhere - so many of such in the church today.

0:23:30.780,0:23:38.580
You consider everything by age, by status - "I have money. I am a graduate..."

0:23:38.580,0:23:42.700
No, first marry the Word and let the Word marry you.

0:23:42.700,0:23:47.860
Get married to have a settled home and a solid foundation.

0:23:47.860,0:23:54.380
Your wife will understand when the goings are tough or when they are good.

0:23:54.380,0:24:02.980
All those things that break homes, cause to scatter, to argue, to divorce - they would understand that all

0:24:02.980,0:24:12.520
this would come, and understand what God says about whatever comes to the house - it matters.

0:24:12.520,0:24:15.320
If I am talking to you let me see your hand.

0:24:15.320,0:24:18.440
You may be seated - thank you.

0:24:18.440,0:24:23.020
My advice to parents and the viewers watching is:

0:24:23.020,0:24:28.080
they should make sure they know what their children are doing.

0:24:28.080,0:24:32.580
Some children don’t like to watch Emmanuel TV, like my own daughter.

0:24:32.580,0:24:36.980
You will know that they have an evil spirit in them.

0:24:36.980,0:24:41.460
That was the reason she was running away from Emmanuel TV.

0:24:41.460,0:24:45.280
In my house, we watch Emmanuel TV, 24 hours a day.

0:24:45.280,0:24:48.420
Whenever we watched, my daughter would always run away.

0:24:48.420,0:24:56.020
She would go down, play music and watch movies.

0:24:56.020,0:25:03.100
No matter what I would say to her, she would refuse to come and watch Emmanuel TV with us.

0:25:03.100,0:25:08.040
Before we brought her here, it was very tough for me.

0:25:08.040,0:25:11.940
I had been preparing since last year to bring her here -

0:25:11.940,0:25:18.960
I would postpone it; one thing or the other caused it not to be possible for me.

0:25:18.960,0:25:28.180
This very day, God really helped me and made everything possible for me.

0:25:28.180,0:25:30.440
I thank God. Thank You, Jesus!

0:25:30.440,0:25:32.400
Thank you - you have listened to that.

0:25:32.400,0:25:37.180
My advice to viewers at home is that whatever situation you are in,

0:25:37.180,0:25:42.980
if it is similar to my own, please run to Jesus immediately so that God locates you and heal you...

0:25:42.980,0:25:44.880
Run to Jesus.

0:25:44.880,0:25:48.020
Run to Jesus immediately so that you can be free.

0:25:48.020,0:25:51.360
Thank you. Run to Jesus so that you can be free.
