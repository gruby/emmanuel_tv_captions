A woman and her two young children were seen outside The SCOAN,

0:00:07.040,0:00:12.620
distressed and in a very emotional state late at night.

0:00:12.620,0:00:19.020
The attention of the Emmanuel TV team was called to their case and they came to find out what had happened

0:00:19.020,0:00:20.600
to this family.

0:00:20.600,0:00:22.000
Let us listen to them.

0:00:22.000,0:00:24.240
My name is Christie Pua.

0:00:24.240,0:00:27.020
I came from Indonesia.

0:00:27.020,0:00:29.700
And who are the two people standing beside you?

0:00:29.700,0:00:34.300
They are my children; Fredrick and Blessing.

0:00:34.300,0:00:40.120
Can you explain the reason why you have come to The SCOAN this evening?

0:00:40.120,0:00:43.240
I am looking for favour from the man of God.

0:00:43.240,0:00:45.160
We have been living here.

0:00:45.160,0:00:50.420
We have run from the village because they accused my husband for being a murderer -

0:00:50.420,0:00:53.020
that he killed his own father.

0:00:53.020,0:01:00.800
After a few months, his niece died and they accused my husband for being the murderer who killed his niece.

0:01:00.800,0:01:06.160
That is why we ran away from the village to Lagos without anything.

0:01:06.160,0:01:11.080
We managed to sell the remaining things in the house only for the transport money.

0:01:11.080,0:01:18.100
Now, we have become like beggars in Lagos – we don't have any place to stay.

0:01:18.100,0:01:22.960
That is why we ran here – we want to look for the favour of the man of God.

0:01:22.960,0:01:25.000
Who is the father of the children?

0:01:25.000,0:01:29.000
His name is John Ken Egesi from Imo State.

0:01:29.000,0:01:32.620
I have been married to him for the past 16 years.

0:01:32.620,0:01:35.380
How did you meet with him?

0:01:35.380,0:01:40.440
We met in Indonesia when he was doing his business.

0:01:40.440,0:01:46.660
He was selling garments and exporting clothes.

0:01:46.660,0:01:56.860
Some years after we married, he said I should come and be introduced to his family in Nigeria.

0:01:56.860,0:02:06.800
I have been here for the past five years, living in Imo State with him, suffering.

0:02:06.800,0:02:14.040
The worst part now is that they accused my husband of murdering his own father and niece.

0:02:14.040,0:02:15.400
That is why we are here now.

0:02:15.400,0:02:17.460
We have no other place.

0:02:17.460,0:02:20.140
My husband is just hustling.

0:02:20.140,0:02:26.240
Sometimes he goes to Alaba and at the end of the day, he brings only 100 or 200 naira.

0:02:26.240,0:02:30.100
How can we eat with 200 naira with these kids?

0:02:30.100,0:02:33.240
Every day, we have to pay for the lodging place.

0:02:33.240,0:02:40.420
Now, they have asked us to pack out and we have no other place to stay.

0:02:40.420,0:02:42.060
How old are your children?

0:02:42.060,0:02:47.780
This one is thirteen years old and this one is five years old.

0:02:47.780,0:02:51.220
Please, man of God, help us!

0:02:51.220,0:02:54.380
Help my little family!

0:02:54.380,0:02:56.160
Where is your husband now?

0:02:56.160,0:02:57.960
I don't know where he is.

0:02:57.960,0:03:09.180
He went out in the morning as usual, hustling and he knows that we no longer have any place to stay.

0:03:09.180,0:03:15.620
I just decided that I cannot live like this any longer.

0:03:15.620,0:03:17.100
My name is Frederick.

0:03:17.100,0:03:21.680
I was born in Indonesia, then, we came to Nigeria.

0:03:21.680,0:03:24.980
Frederick Egesi.

0:03:24.980,0:03:30.460
Since that time, me and my mother and sister have always suffered, all the time.

0:03:30.460,0:03:38.600
Sometimes, we cannot eat and we didn't know what to do any longer.

0:03:38.600,0:03:43.640
In the village, they accused my father of killing somebody.

0:03:43.640,0:03:47.080
That was the problem that brought us to Lagos.

0:03:47.080,0:03:50.540
Food is very hard for us to get.

0:03:50.540,0:03:53.340
Before we eat…

0:03:53.340,0:03:59.660
In our hotel, we don't have money so, we are owing them.

0:03:59.660,0:04:01.080
They have sent us out.

0:04:01.080,0:04:04.600
They are telling us to pack out because we have not paid their money.

0:04:04.600,0:04:07.900
The money we owe them is a lot.

0:04:07.900,0:04:14.580
Since two months, we have been in Lagos and to eat is very hard.

0:04:14.580,0:04:17.260
My daddy – I don’t know where he is.

0:04:17.260,0:04:20.540
He went out in the morning and has not come back.

0:04:20.540,0:04:27.780
He used to go to Alaba and help people so they will give him money.

0:04:27.780,0:04:30.240
That is the only thing he used to do.

0:04:30.240,0:04:32.700
Sometimes, he will come back empty handed.

0:04:32.700,0:04:34.440
He would not hold any money.

0:04:34.440,0:04:35.560
Then, we will not eat.

0:04:35.560,0:04:39.840
We will just sleep until the next day.

0:04:39.840,0:04:41.640
He will be always owing people.

0:04:41.640,0:04:44.180
Now, we have a lot of debts to pay.

0:04:44.180,0:04:47.160
We owe a lot of people now.

0:04:47.160,0:04:51.160
This is our bag because they seized our other bag.

0:04:51.160,0:04:57.220
They seized it because we have not paid the hotel accommodation fee.

0:04:57.220,0:05:02.540
They seized it so this is the only bag we use to manage and come out.

0:05:02.540,0:05:10.300
DEEPLY EMOTIONAL Video That Will Make You CRY!

0:05:10.300,0:05:18.140
My sister's clothes, my mother's and my own clothes and a blanket.

0:05:18.140,0:05:21.500
These are the only things you have for you and your family?

0:05:21.500,0:05:25.300
Yes, the only things we have.

0:05:25.300,0:05:31.540
I came with my own passport but my two kids don't have any ID with them right now.

0:05:31.540,0:05:34.940
It is only me who has my own passport.

0:05:34.940,0:05:36.460
Can we see your documents?

0:05:36.460,0:05:39.120
Yes, of course.

0:05:39.120,0:05:43.720
DEEPLY EMOTIONAL Video That Will Make You CRY!

0:05:43.720,0:05:45.180
This is my passport.

0:05:45.180,0:05:47.740
It is only I who has a passport.

0:05:47.740,0:05:53.800
When we came to Nigeria, we used Travel Certificates.

0:05:53.800,0:05:59.420
Since then, they don’t have any ID, only I do.

0:05:59.420,0:06:07.900
We don’t have any money because since we came to Nigeria, nothing is working for us - nothing at all.

0:06:07.900,0:06:15.620
Please, we are coming here because we know there is solution in this very place – The SCOAN.

0:06:15.620,0:06:19.360
We used to see on Emmanuel TV that the man of God used to help people.

0:06:19.360,0:06:22.380
That is why this is our last bus stop.

0:06:22.380,0:06:26.920
I believe man of God, that our case will not run from you.

0:06:26.920,0:06:31.440
I believe you will help us.

0:06:31.440,0:06:36.940
I don’t even have one naira with me now, as I am talking.

0:06:36.940,0:06:45.360
Even my kids have not eaten since afternoon – we only had a little breakfast this morning.

0:06:45.360,0:06:48.660
Please, man of God, help us!

0:06:48.660,0:06:51.140
My name is Blessing.

0:06:51.140,0:06:55.000
My daddy is not around – he went to Alaba.

0:06:55.000,0:06:57.120
He is looking for money.

0:06:57.120,0:07:02.840
No food – we don’t have money.

0:07:02.840,0:07:12.180
The first thing the Emmanuel TV team did on hearing their pitiful plight was to take them in, give them a good

0:07:12.180,0:07:17.960
hot meal, something to drink, and the place to stay for the night.

0:07:17.960,0:07:21.620
Our first response as Christians is love.

0:07:21.620,0:07:29.500
No matter what situation we find ourselves in or what situation we are presented with; we should love first,

0:07:29.500,0:07:31.920
and walk in the light of love.

0:07:31.920,0:07:37.600
Love is the greatest because God is love.

0:07:37.600,0:07:44.640
After meeting Mrs Egesi and her children, SCOAN representatives called Mr Egesi,

0:07:44.640,0:07:47.040
to inform him of their whereabouts.

0:07:47.040,0:07:50.560
He responded by also making his way to the church.

0:07:50.560,0:07:55.740
The following Sunday, they came out to share their heart-rendering experience.

0:07:55.740,0:07:57.440
Let's listen to them.

0:07:57.440,0:07:59.160
My name is Christie Pua.

0:07:59.160,0:08:00.940
I'm from Indonesia.

0:08:00.940,0:08:03.360
I'm 37 years old.

0:08:03.360,0:08:10.120
These are my children, Frederick and Blessing; he is 13 years old and she is 5 years old.

0:08:10.120,0:08:15.300
The man standing beside them is John Kennedy Egesi, my husband.

0:08:15.300,0:08:24.260
I met my husband in Indonesia about 16 years ago, when he was doing business in my country.

0:08:24.260,0:08:27.960
Since then, we have been married.

0:08:27.960,0:08:35.420
My son Frederick was born in Jakarta (Indonesia) and this one was born in Pakistan.

0:08:35.420,0:08:45.640
After some years of our marriage, my husband decided to bring us to Nigeria to meet his parents.

0:08:45.640,0:08:52.700
I didn't know that on our coming to Nigeria everything would just turn around.

0:08:52.700,0:08:59.280
Nothing worked for us to the extent that we began to suffer greatly.

0:08:59.280,0:09:05.160
I never imagined that we would suffer so much in Nigeria; it was too much for me.

0:09:05.160,0:09:12.360
Even every day I had to cook with firewood, so I had to fetch wood from around the compound.

0:09:12.360,0:09:20.840
If that was not enough, the remaining wood I would give to my son to sell, to get money.

0:09:20.840,0:09:30.260
She said, ever since then she had never expected this kind of difficulties that she, her children and husband

0:09:30.260,0:09:32.700
have been going through.

0:09:32.700,0:09:36.900
Because of these terrible difficulties they have been going through, every morning she had to go to the bush

0:09:36.900,0:09:42.600
to fetch firewood, and after fetching the firewood she was giving some of it to her son to go around the street

0:09:42.600,0:09:46.700
to try to sell it, in order to make money for them to meet their daily needs.

0:09:46.700,0:09:54.020
Not only firewood, when it was the season for aboli, I would pick it around the compound.

0:09:54.020,0:10:03.480
I would clean it, then send my son to take it to sell at the market or if there was eko,

0:10:03.480,0:10:08.840
I would clean it and send him to sell it in the marker.

0:10:08.840,0:10:14.440
All the things I did were to help feed me and my children.

0:10:14.440,0:10:28.980
It's not only me who suffered but my son, he would go to dustbins to pick bottles and things for him to sell

0:10:28.980,0:10:32.260
to help me – to earn a small amount of money from it.

0:10:32.260,0:10:36.200
They dropped out of school for a long time.

0:10:36.200,0:10:42.340
For us to even eat was very difficult, talk less of taking them to school.

0:10:42.340,0:10:48.580
As if all the suffering I went through, for me past five years in Nigeria, was not enough;

0:10:48.580,0:10:54.240
our condition continued to get worse as time went on.

0:10:54.240,0:11:00.800
When my father-in-law died, they accused my husband that he killed my father-in-law.

0:11:00.800,0:11:11.200
After a few months, the niece died and they also accused my husband that he killed the niece as well.

0:11:11.200,0:11:17.640
Before, it was sad but now things have become more tough again, tougher than before.

0:11:17.640,0:11:22.440
After everything that has happened, I cannot bear it again.

0:11:22.440,0:11:26.820
I would plead with my husband every day,

0:11:26.820,0:11:31.980
“Please, I don’t want to lose our lives in this village, I want to live.

0:11:31.980,0:11:36.540
I have left my county for so many years, I still have my family there.

0:11:36.540,0:11:39.240
I don’t want to return only by name.

0:11:39.240,0:11:43.640
It’s better we secure our lives, anything we gather we can sell it.”

0:11:43.640,0:11:52.180
We sold our television and generator for us to get transport to come to Lagos to secure our lives.

0:11:52.180,0:11:54.400
That is why we are here in Lagos.

0:11:54.400,0:12:00.700
We suffered and ran from the village, when we reached Lagos, we still suffered.

0:12:00.700,0:12:06.420
That is what made us to come to The SCOAN to look for help from the man of God.

0:12:06.420,0:12:08.220
Please, man of God.

0:12:08.220,0:12:10.960
Man of God help me and my family.

0:12:10.960,0:12:14.920
I want to go back to my country; I don’t want to live in Nigeria any more.

0:12:14.920,0:12:18.360
Five years is enough for me, please man of God.

0:12:18.360,0:12:20.700
How can I continue living like this?

0:12:20.700,0:12:23.800
I don’t want to and I cannot.

0:12:23.800,0:12:29.200
Even the clothes that I and my children are wearing, someone gave them to us.

0:12:29.200,0:12:34.680
Think about that kind of life – I don’t want it, please man of God.

0:12:34.680,0:12:41.200
There was a clip to show how she was suffering; she was going to the bush, gathering some firewood

0:12:41.200,0:12:42.520
in order to cook for her family.

0:12:42.520,0:12:45.080
Yet, the suffering still continued.

0:12:45.080,0:12:53.380
Since we arrived in Lagos my husband tried to hustle and would go out every morning,

0:12:53.380,0:12:57.200
hustling to get money for us to eat.

0:12:57.200,0:13:04.420
But after much effort my husband would return with only 100 or 200 at the highest 500 naira.

0:13:04.420,0:13:11.080
What can we use that money for when we need to eat and pay for accommodation?

0:13:11.080,0:13:16.520
My name is Frederick, this is my mother, sister and my father.

0:13:16.520,0:13:22.680
Since the day we came to Nigeria we have been suffering – all the time.

0:13:22.680,0:13:28.960
To the extent that I would go to the bush to pick things to sell.

0:13:28.960,0:13:39.280
Bottles and other things just to help my mother.

0:13:39.280,0:13:47.460
I’m not going to school, even my sister is not going to school; we have dropped out for a long time.

0:13:47.460,0:13:53.360
I want the man of God to help us so we can leave this country, we have suffered a lot.

0:13:53.360,0:13:55.460
Please man of God, help us.

0:13:55.460,0:13:59.160
My name is John Kennedy Egasi

0:13:59.160,0:14:01.760
I am from Imo State, Nigeria.

0:14:01.760,0:14:08.440
The people beside me are my wife, son and little daughter.

0:14:08.440,0:14:15.260
We lived abroad for a long time but after some time, I decided to bring my family home.

0:14:15.260,0:14:21.880
I brought them home, everything was fine before I came home.

0:14:21.880,0:14:26.580
But all of a sudden, when I came home everything turned around.

0:14:26.580,0:14:34.940
Things started going bad; nothing was working out.

0:14:34.940,0:14:43.280
Even to the extent that they accused me of killing my father who we had been taking care of.

0:14:43.280,0:14:45.240
How can I kill my father?

0:14:45.240,0:14:51.260
They accused me and started calling me names and all sorts.

0:14:51.260,0:14:58.740
When the insults became too much – we couldn’t take it anymore, we decided to come to Lagos.

0:14:58.740,0:15:06.700
We sold our generator, television and things to get to Lagos.

0:15:06.700,0:15:17.000
When we got to Lagos, we tried to find a place to stay that would cost little like 1,500 naira.

0:15:17.000,0:15:23.260
We stayed there paying 1,500 naira everyday but things got worse and worse.

0:15:23.260,0:15:30.360
I decided to be going out to hustle, to help people doing business or something like that.

0:15:30.360,0:15:33.180
Along the line, still nothing was working out.

0:15:33.180,0:15:41.480
When I would finish work, after working hard they would give me 200, 500 at the highest 1,000 naira.

0:15:41.480,0:15:45.360
I was not able to pay for the house rent again.

0:15:45.360,0:15:48.820
Even sometimes, we would sleep without eating.

0:15:48.820,0:15:55.800
Everything was upside down, it has been too stressful on my side.

0:15:55.800,0:16:06.680
On Friday, I was trying to get home, I was walking on foot because I can’t always afford the bus -

0:16:06.680,0:16:09.920
sometimes when I enter the bus, they push me down.

0:16:09.920,0:16:21.060
I was trying to get home on foot when I got a call around 12 o’clock.

0:16:21.060,0:16:25.840
It was an evangelist calling me from The SCOAN.

0:16:25.840,0:16:27.060
I asked what the problem was.

0:16:27.060,0:16:30.820
They said they had found my wife and kids at their street.

0:16:30.820,0:16:31.920
I asked what had happened.

0:16:31.920,0:16:34.580
They said they were crying, saying they had not been eating and no one knows.

0:16:34.580,0:16:38.080
I shed tears and from there, I managed to get to this place.

0:16:38.080,0:16:45.520
I want to first of all thank the man of God for taking care of my wife from that Friday.

0:16:45.520,0:16:54.920
Mr Egesi & Family
Sharing Life Experience

0:16:54.920,0:16:59.940
You can see how pathetic the situation is.

0:16:59.940,0:17:05.100
We quite understand that it hasn't been easy at all.

0:17:05.100,0:17:08.340
Let us listen attentively.

0:17:08.340,0:17:15.800
I want to first of all thank the man of God for taking care of my wife since that Friday to this moment;

0:17:15.800,0:17:20.140
I want to thank him so much.

0:17:20.140,0:17:24.180
From that time till now, that is how we are.

0:17:24.180,0:17:28.860
This is how I came to The SCOAN.

0:17:28.860,0:17:33.920
I thank the man of God for the help he has given to my wife

0:17:33.920,0:17:44.160
and I am still begging him if he can help them so they will be able to achieve

0:17:44.160,0:17:47.260
what they want from the man of God.

0:17:47.260,0:17:50.780
My own is different, there’s no problem, I’m a Nigerian.

0:17:50.780,0:17:54.180
We thank God Almighty for this moment.

0:17:54.180,0:17:57.840
We believe that man of God will definitely come to your aid.

0:17:57.840,0:18:03.980
"To spend more on others and less on ourselves".

0:18:03.980,0:18:06.060
We are going to hear from the man of God very soon.

0:18:06.060,0:18:11.580
Whatever the man of God is going to do, we will be able to assist you and take you out of the

0:18:11.580,0:18:19.540
problem you are facing and wipe out your tears, in Jesus' name.

0:18:19.540,0:18:27.000
After accommodating Mr Egesi and his family and listening to their pitiful life experience, T.B. Joshua

0:18:27.000,0:18:33.880
and the Emmanuel TV Partners assist them to enable them to get back on their feet with a renewed hope

0:18:33.880,0:18:35.800

0:20:40.540,0:20:43.740
Mrs Christie Pua & Family

0:20:43.740,0:20:51.460

and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide who have heard about that case.

0:23:54.100,0:23:59.520
As we said - as Christians we cannot afford to look the other way when we see our neighbors in trouble.

0:23:59.520,0:24:02.300
Our sister came in tears to The SCOAN.

0:24:02.300,0:24:04.440
She was on the street with her little children.

0:24:04.440,0:24:09.960
Today, to the glory of God, the mission of Emmanuel TV - you can see it in the life of this family;

0:24:09.960,0:24:16.060
"Changing lives, changing nations and changing the world".

Amen. Let's put our hands for Jesus Christ!

0:24:37.220,0:24:43.600
Man of God, I am speechless now.

0:24:43.600,0:24:47.180
Thank you for helping my husband also.

0:24:47.180,0:24:49.680
I still love my husband.

0:24:49.680,0:24:56.080

0:25:01.920,0:25:06.260

0:25:06.260,0:25:11.080
They are giving us $3,000 USD to go back to Indonesia.

0:25:11.080,0:25:18.400
They will pay for our tickets and give us scholarships so we will not go back to picking up bottles on the road.

0:25:18.400,0:25:20.420
Thank you man of God.

0:25:20.420,0:25:23.260
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:25:23.260,0:25:27.740
I thank the man of God so much.

0:25:27.740,0:25:30.800
Now, I don’t need to move around on foot anymore.

0:25:30.800,0:25:35.060
Nobody will push me down from the bus.

0:25:35.060,0:25:37.780
I thank you so much, man of God.

0:25:37.780,0:25:43.140
A bundle of thanks.

0:25:43.140,0:25:45.380
Only good will be seen in this life.

TESTIMONY TIME

0:25:55.840,0:26:02.020
This is really marvelous to see the transformation that is happening in the lives of the people.

0:26:02.020,0:26:04.740
This family's life has really been transformed.

0:26:04.740,0:26:08.400
They came here in tears of sorrow.

0:26:08.400,0:26:12.220
God Almighty used His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to transform their life.

0:26:12.220,0:26:14.760
It was indeed a radical transformation.

0:26:14.760,0:26:20.100
Truly, we cannot afford as Christians to look the other way when our brother is in need.

0:26:20.100,0:26:26.640
We have been called as Christians to respond to all human needs; for that is what love entails.

0:26:26.640,0:26:31.200
We have seen the manifestation of this in the life of the family.

0:26:31.200,0:26:34.580
We can see them with smiles of joy.

0:26:34.580,0:26:37.500
We can see a big difference.

0:26:37.500,0:26:44.760
We saw them first time when they came to The SCOAN  some weeks ago.

0:26:44.760,0:26:53.860
Anybody would hardly recognize this family some weeks ago because you see that something marvelous,

0:26:53.860,0:26:59.980
something wonderful, a great transformation has indeed occurred in their life.

0:26:59.980,0:27:01.280
We give glory to God Almighty.

0:27:01.280,0:27:08.920
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

0:27:08.920,0:27:14.260
We are going to hear directly from them, how God Almighty has indeed blessed them.

0:27:14.260,0:27:15.980
Can we just hear from you?

0:27:15.980,0:27:20.060
What you have to say concerning what God has done in your life?

0:27:20.060,0:27:21.600
Good Morning, Church!

0:27:49.160,0:27:51.280
I am 37 years old.

0:27:51.280,0:27:58.660
As you have seen before in the video, those were the things that brought me and my little family

0:27:58.660,0:28:06.000
to The SCOAN looking for the favour of the man of God.

0:28:06.000,0:28:11.560

0:28:17.680,0:28:22.460
We are here today to thank God for everything He has done for us

0:28:22.460,0:28:30.760
and to thank the man of God for allowing himself to be an instrument and problem solver for us.

0:28:30.760,0:28:36.180
I also want to thank the Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world

0:28:36.180,0:28:45.900
and The SCOAN for what they have done for me and my little family.

0:28:45.900,0:28:50.460
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:28:50.460,0:28:59.020
As you were watching the clip; when you came to The SCOAN, there were some complains you made.

0:28:59.020,0:29:08.460
You also made your request known to the man of God, Emmanuel TV Partners and viewers all over the world.

0:29:08.460,0:29:17.220
Today, can you tell us what can you say about your request that has indeed been made?

0:29:17.220,0:29:20.260
I really thank God for everything.

0:29:20.260,0:29:27.820
Man of God has made our wish come to pass.

0:29:27.820,0:29:34.020
Here is my passport and my children’s documents and as you can see here,

0:29:34.020,0:29:47.760
these are our tickets to go back to Indonesia for me and my children.

0:29:47.760,0:29:55.700
We heard from the lady; the first time she came to The SCOAN the complain was that only she had a passport

0:29:55.700,0:29:58.520
but her children had no documents.

0:29:58.520,0:30:04.600
Despite the fact she had a passport, there was not way she could have traveled back to her country.

0:30:04.600,0:30:06.460
That was a complain she made.

0:30:06.460,0:30:13.360
We give glory to God that today man of God has indeed rescued them out of that terrible situation.

0:30:13.360,0:30:17.380
As we heard from the woman - what she said just now; that the man of God has indeed

0:30:17.380,0:30:20.360
procured them a passport.

0:30:20.360,0:30:27.020
We can see her holding her own passport and two passports of her children, that were procured

0:30:27.020,0:30:28.480
by the man of God.

0:30:28.480,0:30:33.680
Not only that; she has pointed to the documents we have seen on the board next to them.

0:30:33.680,0:30:37.880
These are tickets for their travel back to their country - Indonesia.

0:30:37.880,0:30:44.880
We want her to go beside the board and explain to us what the documents are all about.

0:30:48.200,0:30:57.960
These are our airline tickets provided by the man of God for me, my son and daughter.

0:30:57.960,0:31:06.860
These are the documents I need for me as a Nigerian’s wife.

0:31:06.860,0:31:10.020
We are going back on Tuesday.

0:31:10.020,0:31:12.480
Shall we put our hands together beautifully!

0:31:12.480,0:31:14.400
That clap is not enough for Jesus!

0:31:14.400,0:31:20.980
Put your hands together louder and louder for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

0:31:20.980,0:31:29.340
This is a woman that came here crying, in pain and sorrow because they were in a terrible situation.

0:31:29.340,0:31:31.180
All hope was lost.

0:31:31.180,0:31:37.280
She never had any idea for getting out of this problem.

0:31:37.280,0:31:42.380
But through His Anointed Servant - Prophet T.B. Joshua, whom God has been using to bless millions and millions

0:31:42.380,0:31:45.240
all over the world - today, their life is transformed.

0:31:45.240,0:31:52.680
Today, she can talk about procurement not only of the passports and documents for her children but also visa

0:31:52.680,0:32:00.360
and tickets for the travel back and to start life anew in their country - Indonesia.

0:32:00.360,0:32:05.120
Once again, shall we put our hands together for the living God!

Not only that, the man of God has spent a lot of money on us for our documents, accommodation

0:32:16.880,0:32:23.160
and all the necessary things that have to do with us.

0:32:23.160,0:32:26.620
Altogether, it is about six million naira.

0:32:26.620,0:32:29.740

0:32:39.500,0:32:43.560

0:32:43.560,0:32:53.280
We also watched how the husband was given a sum of 500,000 naira, to establish himself financially here.

0:32:53.280,0:33:01.000
A visa for her and passports for her children were procured, together with traveling tickets

0:33:01.000,0:33:07.120
and all necessary documents, aside from the fees and expenses for transportation to be able to procure

0:33:07.120,0:33:08.900
these documents.

0:33:08.900,0:33:17.040
She is telling the whole world that this money sums up to 6,000,000 naira.

0:33:17.040,0:33:23.120
Let us put our hands together for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

0:33:23.120,0:33:24.480
We give glory to God Almighty.

0:33:24.480,0:33:29.940
Madam, having seen what God Almighty has done in your life; can you tell us what you have to say about

0:33:29.940,0:33:31.400
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?

0:33:31.400,0:33:37.440
What advice you have for millions and millions of people listening to you all over the world, regarding what God

0:33:37.440,0:33:40.080
had done in your life?

0:33:40.080,0:33:45.220
Before I give my advice, I would like to thank The SCOAN evangelists.

0:33:45.220,0:33:50.700
Since we have been here, they have been preparing us spiritually.

0:33:50.700,0:33:59.160
The man of God has catered not only for our physical needs but also spiritual needs as well

0:33:59.160,0:34:03.500
for us to keep hanging onto God.

0:34:03.500,0:34:15.140
My advice to those all over the world and everyone here is, “Don’t run from God; run to Him"

0:34:15.140,0:34:20.940
because God has something to say in every situation.

0:34:20.940,0:34:25.320
Amen.

0:34:25.320,0:34:26.000
Hallelujah.

0:34:26.000,0:34:31.020
We have heard from the woman that she was blessed not only financially;

0:34:31.020,0:34:33.900
her spiritual life has also been enriched.

0:34:33.900,0:34:39.120
Since she has been here at The SCOAN she spent time listening to the Word of God

0:34:39.120,0:34:42.180
and her spiritual life has indeed been enriched.

0:34:42.180,0:34:45.960
We give glory to God Almighty.

We want to ask our sister a question.

0:35:44.300,0:35:50.080
We know that God Almighty never considers our past in order to determine our future.

0:35:50.080,0:35:56.360
God Almighty has indeed forgiven our past; the past of the sister, her children and her husband as well.

0:35:56.360,0:36:01.560
We want to ask you sister; can you tell the whole world and viewers all over the world

0:36:01.560,0:36:10.180
that are listening to you right now - with a hope you will not disappoint your husband, since God Almighty in His

0:36:10.180,0:36:16.460
own infinite mercy has wiped away your past and given birth to your future -

0:36:16.460,0:36:22.720
can you tell us that you don't disappoint your husband and you see through to him?

0:36:22.720,0:36:23.920
Yes.

0:36:23.920,0:36:31.080
We are still going to continue communicating because it doesn't matter where we are.

0:36:31.080,0:36:43.500
It is only distance that is between us but our love and care cannot be separated by distance.

0:36:43.500,0:36:45.520
Thank you.
Thank you, man of God.

0:36:45.520,0:36:52.080
May God bless you abundantly and give you long life and prosperity.

0:36:52.080,0:36:55.800
Anything you touch shall prosper, in Jesus’ name.

0:36:55.800,0:37:00.480
Amen. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:37:00.480,0:37:07.400
We have heard from the woman that she just promised the whole world that she would not

0:37:07.400,0:37:09.540
disappoint her husband.

0:37:09.540,0:37:17.280
Even though they may be far apart physically, the distance does not affect their marriage and their union.

0:37:17.280,0:37:24.160
Their love remains and the love of God will continue to hold them forever.

0:37:24.160,0:37:30.860
Once again, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:37:30.860,0:37:34.300

We are so much blessed by watching what God has done in the life of this family.

0:40:11.160,0:40:14.500
We have one more question for you madam.

0:40:14.500,0:40:23.340
As you are going back to your country Indonesia with your two children, we want to ask you,

0:40:23.340,0:40:30.760
"Are you going to train up your children in the way of the Lord, so as they grow up they will not depart from it?"

0:40:30.760,0:40:35.000
The whole world is watching.

0:40:35.000,0:40:39.320
They have witnessed what God Almighty has done in your life.

0:40:39.320,0:40:42.560
These children are now under your care.

0:40:42.560,0:40:50.300
Observing the evil happening all around the world, we want to ask you one more time,

0:40:50.300,0:40:59.780
"Are you going to train up your children in the way of the Lord, so as they grow up they will not depart from it?"

0:40:59.780,0:41:08.220
Yes, I promise to train my children in the way of the Lord by the grace of God, in Jesus’ name.

0:41:08.220,0:41:12.160
Amen.

0:41:12.160,0:41:13.520
Hallelujah, we give glory to God.

0:41:13.520,0:41:18.220
We have heard from her a promise to the whole world that she will train up these children

0:41:18.220,0:41:19.200
in the way of the Lord.

0:41:19.200,0:41:24.740
Man of God always advises us that we should follow God's instruction for our life, and His instruction

0:41:24.740,0:41:28.560
will set us on the good route to the good life.

0:41:28.560,0:41:31.480
We give glory to God Almighty.

0:41:31.480,0:41:33.080
We heard from the wife.

Can you introduce yourself and tell what you have to say concerning what God has done in your life?

0:41:47.620,0:41:48.800
Good Morning Church!

0:41:48.800,0:41:50.160
[Good Morning.]

0:41:50.160,0:41:55.240
I am very happy.

0:41:55.240,0:42:00.440
I am John Kennedy Egesi from Imo State, Nigeria.

0:42:00.440,0:42:06.980
I am very, very happy about what the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners have

0:42:06.980,0:42:09.580
done in the life of my family.

0:42:09.580,0:42:12.120
I am very happy about that.

0:42:12.120,0:42:18.020
I want to use this opportunity to thank them so much.

0:42:18.020,0:42:23.640
I am more than happy at this very period because if you watch me now and watched before,

0:42:23.640,0:42:28.720
you will see that I am like a bank manager now.

0:42:28.720,0:42:33.080
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:42:33.080,0:42:39.260
This man is appreciating God for what He has done in his life.

0:42:39.260,0:42:48.160
Indeed, if you watched the clips from their arrival to SCOAN and you see them now, hardly you will recognize

0:42:48.160,0:42:50.080
that it is the same person.

0:42:50.080,0:42:55.940
Not only his spiritual and financial life has been transformed but also the physical appearance.

0:42:55.940,0:43:01.380
Looking at them, you can know that God has indeed done something wonderful and marvelous in their life.

0:43:01.380,0:43:06.240
The brother can not contain this, as he speaks out and glorifies the Name of God to the whole world.

0:43:06.240,0:43:10.140
Once again; put your hand together for the miracle working God.

0:43:10.140,0:43:13.080
Hallelujah.

0:43:13.080,0:43:21.920
I am so happy; I really want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners across the world.

0:43:21.920,0:43:30.480
I am thanking the evangelists for the way they helped us here with accommodation and everything else here.

0:43:30.480,0:43:35.180
I really thank them so much.

0:43:35.180,0:43:39.600
The man of God supported me also with the sum of 500,000 naira.

0:43:39.600,0:43:46.400
Now, I cannot be pushed out of a bus and I won’t travel by foot anymore.

0:43:46.400,0:43:51.460
I will be able to establish my life before my wife and children come back again.

0:43:51.460,0:43:54.120
I really thank the man of God.

Prophet T.B. Joshua, his financial life has been totally transformed.

0:44:16.540,0:44:23.320
He will be now able to establish himself financially out there, in the world.

0:44:23.320,0:44:30.760
No more running around on bare foot, no more being humiliated or embarrassed in the public,

0:44:30.760,0:44:37.720

0:45:55.780,0:45:59.820
apart from the financial and spiritual blessings that he has received from the man of God

0:45:59.820,0:46:05.000
Prophet T.B. Joshua, all the breakthrough doors have been opened.

0:46:05.000,0:46:09.460
He has been receiving breakthroughs in every area of his life.

0:46:09.460,0:46:20.720
Coming of this woman to The SCOAN has brought family union and immense blessing in their lives.

We give glory to God Almighty.

0:46:23.500,0:46:30.120
We want to ask the husband one vital question.

0:46:30.120,0:46:39.820
As your wife will be travelling to Indonesia with your two children and they are going to start a new life there

0:46:39.820,0:46:41.160
in Christ Jesus,

0:46:41.160,0:46:49.420
and the wife was asked the question earlier and she made a promise, we want to ask you a question,

0:46:49.420,0:46:56.440
"Are you going to promise the whole world now that you will remain faithful and loyal to your wife,

0:46:56.440,0:47:01.520
even while you are not together physically?"

0:47:01.520,0:47:07.160
She knows quite well that sometimes I can make calls for two hours when we are not together,

0:47:07.160,0:47:12.480
talk less of now that the hand of God is involved.

0:47:12.480,0:47:17.380
For sure, we will continue to be together; distance is not a barrier.

0:47:17.380,0:47:23.360
You have heard the promise from the husband that distance is indeed not a barrier,

0:47:23.360,0:47:30.780
that although they may not be together physically but the love of God is binding them together.

0:47:30.780,0:47:34.900
He will remain truthful and faithful to the wife.

0:47:34.900,0:47:37.220
We give glory to God Almighty.

0:47:37.220,0:47:41.280
He said that communication would not be a problem.

0:47:41.280,0:47:49.500
We give glory for this restoration of peace, unity, happiness in this family.

0:47:49.500,0:47:52.780
God Almighty has indeed established them financially.

0:47:52.780,0:48:01.100
Their spiritual life has been transformed and today they can talk of a new life in Christ Jesus.

0:48:01.100,0:48:07.140
Children of God, million thanks is not enough to glorify the Name of God

0:48:07.140,0:48:10.180
for what He has done in the life of this family.

0:48:10.180,0:48:11.880
Who could have justly done this?

0:48:11.880,0:48:16.020
It is none other than our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

0:48:16.020,0:48:27.080
They came here in tears of sorrow, discomfort, pain but today tears of sorrow have been totally wiped away,

0:48:27.080,0:48:32.160
by God Almighty through the Anointed Servant Prophet T.B. Joshua, and we give Him all the glory.

0:48:32.160,0:48:38.840
Put your hands together once again for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

0:48:38.840,0:48:43.260
Finally, we want to hear from the son.

Your family is a living testimony to the mightiness and goodness of God in lives of the people.

0:50:34.800,0:50:41.920
It can educate the people out there that may be in the same condition as this family was before.

0:50:41.920,0:50:49.120
No matter the situation you may be going through; you should trust in the goodness of God Almighty.

0:50:49.120,0:50:54.740
Continue to appreciate Him because faith requires us to speak before we see or feel the result.

0:50:54.740,0:51:00.080
We give glory to God Almighty that today we are happy and rejoicing in the Lord for what He has done

0:51:00.080,0:51:02.120

That is what Christianity is all about.

0:51:04.220,0:51:09.720
The man of God says that we are indeed called as Christians to respond to all human needs.

Make sure, wherever you may be, to continue to follow His instruction daily for your life.

0:52:18.460,0:52:24.240
Make sure, as you promised madam, that these children will be trained up in the way of the Lord,

0:52:24.240,0:52:28.480

0:56:37.320,0:56:46.740

0:56:46.740,0:56:59.820
what my future plan was and I told him my heart desire to build an orphanage in Indonesia.

0:56:59.820,0:57:06.100
I am an orphan and I know what it feels like to be an orphan.

0:57:06.100,0:57:11.320
I have passion to help the needy, those who are less privileged.

0:57:11.320,0:57:17.320
The man of God was very happy with my future plan.

0:57:17.320,0:57:25.160

0:57:33.780,0:57:35.060

I am addressing my Indonesia people that they should come and feel the presence of God

0:59:19.620,0:59:23.300
at The SCOAN.

0:59:23.300,0:59:30.500
I assured them that once they came to the arena of liberty, their lives would never be the same,

0:59:30.500,0:59:31.700
in Jesus' name.

0:59:31.700,0:59:33.000

We are going to the airport now to catch our flight to Indonesia.

0:59:51.720,0:59:57.780
I thank the man of God and the Emmanuel TV Partners for all the expenses -

0:59:57.780,1:00:05.740
buying our tickets, passports, visas and everything, blessing my mum and dad.

1:00:05.740,1:00:09.120
They did everything for us; I am so happy.

1:00:09.120,1:00:12.180
We will come back with a testimony, in Jesus' name.

1:00:12.180,1:00:13.200

A million thanks is not enough for how God has restored this family.

1:01:01.020,1:01:07.020
As Mr Egesi embraces his family as they get ready to embark on their journey, he is also at peace

1:01:07.020,1:01:14.180
as the man of God has blessed him with the sum of 500,000 naira to establish himself in Nigeria.

1:01:14.180,1:01:25.140
Mr Egesi & Family

1:01:25.140,1:01:32.480

1:01:32.480,1:01:39.600
and his family, accommodated them and made all their travelling arrangements to start a new life.

1:01:39.600,1:01:48.760
As the Bible says in Psalm 30:5, "weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning."

1:01:48.760,1:02:04.780
Mr Egesi & Family

1:02:04.780,1:02:10.980
