DELIVERANCE TIME

0:00:05.280,0:00:11.240
Offering the prayer of faith in accordance with the book of James 5:16 and Acts 4:30,

0:00:11.240,0:00:15.660
Wise Man Daniel is used as an instrument of deliverance in the hands of the Holy Spirit.

0:00:15.660,0:00:21.820
As he is moved through the auditorium, on meeting this man, the fire of the Holy Ghost falls upon him,

0:00:21.820,0:00:27.300
and the demonic entity behind his setback and affliction is exposed and arrested.

0:00:27.300,0:00:33.220
Witness this inspiring deliverance as this man encounters Wise Man Daniel.

0:00:33.220,0:00:34.920
Can you speak? Who are you?

0:00:34.920,0:00:37.340
I am the idols of his father's house.

0:00:37.340,0:00:40.240
What have you done to him?

0:00:40.240,0:00:42.780
I am killing him little by little.

0:00:42.780,0:00:44.900
You are killing him little by little?

0:00:44.900,0:00:45.620
Yes.

0:00:45.620,0:00:48.760
He is a preacher of the Gospel.

0:00:48.760,0:00:50.100
He is a preacher of the Gospel?

0:00:50.100,0:00:51.380
Yes.

0:00:51.380,0:00:52.840
What have you done to him?

0:00:52.840,0:00:59.240
He is a stubborn person; we have decided to frustrate him.

0:00:59.240,0:01:04.400
For four hundred and something years, we have been in his father's house.

0:01:04.400,0:01:11.980
He decided to break the yoke by becoming the first born-again.

0:01:11.980,0:01:16.380
He has been a thorn in our flesh.

0:01:16.380,0:01:21.380
We are from the kingdom, the sanctum of darkness.

0:01:21.380,0:01:23.020
That is where we come from.

0:01:23.020,0:01:29.340
He gathered some people and they came to his father's house to trouble us.

0:01:29.340,0:01:37.440
While they were praying, his prayer was different and so,

0:01:37.440,0:01:43.360
we decided that we are going to disgrace him by frustrating him.

0:01:43.360,0:01:52.280
In the beginning of his life when he wanted to get married, we delivered a wife unto him.

0:01:52.280,0:01:59.420
He is a man who likes beautiful women, so we gave him a beautiful woman.

0:01:59.420,0:02:10.080
We gave the woman a heart of stone, so that whatsoever he does or says would not appeal to her.

0:02:10.080,0:02:14.100
We decided to fight him from the inside.

0:02:14.100,0:02:17.540
He is an associate pastor.

0:02:17.540,0:02:22.540
He has gone from one ministry to the other.

0:02:22.540,0:02:28.840
We decided that we would frustrate him and all his ventures.

0:02:28.840,0:02:34.180
From one place to another, we have always been tele-guiding him.

0:02:34.180,0:02:40.780
But he has always been praying and asking God when this affliction would be over.

0:02:40.780,0:02:48.480
His father and forefathers have dedicated him, even before his birth.

0:02:48.480,0:02:57.140
Every time, his father renews the covenant we have with him.

0:02:57.140,0:03:02.120
All the other children of his father are still in our captivity.

0:03:02.120,0:03:06.700
But this one has been stubborn towards us.

0:03:06.700,0:03:12.300
He still wants to deliver the rest of his brothers.

0:03:12.300,0:03:17.620
He led his mother to Christ and we are not happy about that.

0:03:17.620,0:03:27.160
He is also working hard to make sure that his father departs from our kingdom but we are saying, "No".

0:03:27.160,0:03:32.940
If we don’t destroy him from the inside, we will never get him.

0:03:32.940,0:03:38.940
But we don’t know how he managed to locate this place.

0:03:38.940,0:03:41.720
What is wrong with this place that you don’t like?

0:03:41.720,0:03:44.840
Everybody knows what is wrong with this place.

0:03:44.840,0:03:50.120
The fires are too much.

0:03:50.120,0:03:53.700
Deliverance at the SCOAN

0:03:53.700,0:03:55.860
What does the fire do to your kingdom?

0:03:55.860,0:04:05.480
Immediately your hand touched his head, you ignited the fire that was quenched before and

0:04:05.480,0:04:12.240
strong roots of our tree inside him began to fall.

0:04:12.240,0:04:16.520
The fire is too much.

0:04:16.520,0:04:22.600
We tried to frustrate him this morning not to come, igniting a quarrel between him and his wife this morning

0:04:22.600,0:04:24.680
so that he would not be able to come here.

0:04:24.680,0:04:27.660
Were you sleeping when he came here?

0:04:27.660,0:04:29.980
We didn’t know it was going to work out.

0:04:29.980,0:04:39.320
A mighty hand held his wrist and drew him into this place against our wish.

0:04:39.320,0:04:41.360
Which hand was that?

0:04:41.360,0:04:45.300
We don’t know where the hand came from but we know that hand is a very strong hand.

0:04:45.300,0:04:47.460
Does it mean you people cannot resist that hand?

0:04:47.460,0:04:52.620
The hand is so strong and looks like the hand of a great lion.

0:04:52.620,0:04:56.500
There is fire in the fingers of the lion.

0:04:56.500,0:05:04.540
When the hand held him, we were surprised because it was a strange appearance.

0:05:04.540,0:05:11.960
Right now, it is time you go.

0:05:11.960,0:05:14.840
Come out!

0:05:14.840,0:05:18.880
Out, you demon!

0:05:18.880,0:05:26.320
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:05:26.320,0:05:30.220
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:30.220,0:05:31.940
You are going.

0:05:31.940,0:05:34.920
Come out!

0:05:34.920,0:05:41.740
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:05:41.740,0:05:44.680
In Jesus' name.

0:05:44.680,0:05:47.000
You are delivered. Rise up.

0:05:47.000,0:06:06.880
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:06:06.880,0:06:08.600
How are you, sir?

0:06:08.600,0:06:10.040
I am fine.

0:06:10.040,0:06:12.200
What happened to you, sir?

0:06:12.200,0:06:16.440
I have never fallen on the ground before. I am a pastor.

0:06:16.440,0:06:18.020
I am surprised.

0:06:18.020,0:06:20.520
You don’t know what pushed you down?

0:06:20.520,0:06:25.480
I don’t know. I know I was sitting upstairs.

0:06:25.480,0:06:27.760
I have never fallen down before.

0:06:27.760,0:06:29.440
I am surprised.

0:06:29.440,0:06:32.840
But now that you have fallen down for the first time in the history of you being a pastor,

0:06:32.840,0:06:36.680
what do you have to say?

0:06:36.680,0:06:41.540
I think power pass power.

0:06:41.540,0:06:43.220
All power belongs to Jesus.

0:06:43.220,0:06:44.960
Thank you very much.

0:06:44.960,0:06:52.480
But you said something now – you said you are 430 years old and that you are an idol from the family.

0:06:52.480,0:06:53.180
Me?

0:06:53.180,0:06:54.720
Yes.

0:06:54.720,0:06:58.320
I am a pastor. I am just 50 years old. I am not an idol.

0:06:58.320,0:06:59.560
You are not 430 years old?

0:06:59.560,0:07:02.220
No, I am just 50 years old.

0:07:02.220,0:07:05.580
That very demon that was tormenting your life, is out.

0:07:05.580,0:07:06.560
Thank you very much.

0:07:06.560,0:07:07.500
You are delivered.

0:07:07.500,0:07:08.140
Praise the Lord!

0:07:08.140,0:07:09.360
Live the rest of your life to please Jesus.

0:07:09.360,0:07:10.460
Hallelujah!

0:07:10.460,0:07:11.260
God bless you.

0:07:11.260,0:07:12.620
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:12.620,0:07:13.520
Praise the Lord!

0:07:13.520,0:07:18.940
TESTIMONY TIME

0:07:18.940,0:07:22.000
Emmanuel!
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:07:22.000,0:07:22.740
Amen.

0:07:22.740,0:07:26.800
My name is Pastor Uchechukwu Lukman.

0:07:26.800,0:07:31.780
The woman standing beside me is my lovely helpmate.

0:07:31.780,0:07:36.140
I am a pastor by calling.

0:07:36.140,0:07:40.500
By His grace, I'm an evangelist who is into deliverance ministry.

0:07:40.500,0:07:48.240
I grew up in a background that was rooted in idol worship.

0:07:48.240,0:07:53.620
When we were growing up, we were taken to the shrine and were given incisions.

0:07:53.620,0:07:57.340
Even up to this date, we still have some of those shrines in my father's house.

0:07:57.340,0:08:02.100
My father still sacrifices animals to them.

0:08:02.100,0:08:04.420
We had those incisions.

0:08:04.420,0:08:11.180
When I grew up, things were not working; not just for me alone but for my family,

0:08:11.180,0:08:14.300
my immediate siblings and my cousins.

0:08:14.300,0:08:16.520
Things were not working out.

0:08:16.520,0:08:23.400
There was this barrier of limitation that had always been with those before me -

0:08:23.400,0:08:26.380
those who were older than me.

0:08:26.380,0:08:36.240
We had been living a life of strife and limitation until eventually, like I said, I gave my life to Christ.

0:08:36.240,0:08:43.800
In my family, I became the first born-again Christian after over 400 years.

0:08:43.800,0:08:48.600
It was tough growing up in those days; I was disowned by my parents.

0:08:48.600,0:08:53.040
I was rejected and cast away by my family.

0:08:53.040,0:08:59.380
It was difficult living in my community then as a child of God.

0:08:59.380,0:09:03.200
To God be the glory, I did not deny my faith.

0:09:03.200,0:09:06.200
I continued.

0:09:06.200,0:09:08.560
Until...

0:09:08.560,0:09:14.500
I left the church and started working in some other ministries,

0:09:14.500,0:09:20.280
moving around, both here and outside the country for evangelical work.

0:09:20.280,0:09:28.640
It was not easy – you would minister to people; they would get miracles but they would not remember you.

0:09:28.640,0:09:33.200
A lot of them would prosper but they would not remember you.

0:09:33.200,0:09:36.180
That had been happening.

0:09:36.180,0:09:41.180
I knew that I was from a background of idol worship.

0:09:41.180,0:09:45.080
I knew it was a problem and I had gone for counselling.

0:09:45.080,0:09:52.900
I had gone to many ministers of God for deliverance and counselling but the thing remained there.

0:09:52.900,0:09:56.320
The most agonising thing was

0:09:56.320,0:10:01.140
you know, if you are a man of God and you don’t have a settled home,

0:10:01.140,0:10:05.480
then you have a problem because you must first of all pastor your house.

0:10:05.480,0:10:22.360
But I had a partner who was supposed to be a helpmate but in the background was an enemy

0:10:22.360,0:10:28.040
whom the devil was using to work against me.

0:10:28.040,0:10:37.160
My lovely wife in those days, before last week, would not greet me, "Good morning".

0:10:37.160,0:10:39.640
We lived like that for years.

0:10:39.640,0:10:44.000
We didn’t share the same bedroom; we did not eat together.

0:10:44.000,0:10:47.600
I did not even eat in the house.

0:10:47.600,0:10:53.700
Sometimes, before I went to the altar and picked up the microphone,

0:10:53.700,0:11:00.820
I would have my day spoiled and my psyche depressed.

0:11:00.820,0:11:03.760
I know what that means as a minister.

0:11:03.760,0:11:12.700
It had been a battle until I met some friends who handed a hospitality company over to me.

0:11:12.700,0:11:20.060
I began to manage that company as a hospitality business while also doing my pastoral work.

0:11:20.060,0:11:24.200
Surprisingly, I would see people who worshipped at The SCOAN come to the company.

0:11:24.200,0:11:26.800
They were my customers.

0:11:26.800,0:11:30.880
They would come with their problems.

0:11:30.880,0:11:36.700
You would see them coming to The SCOAN; when they returned back to the hotel, they would be different.

0:11:36.700,0:11:43.560
I saw the case of a particular woman who came to The SCOAN and came back with the Anointing Water.

0:11:43.560,0:11:49.160
She used it and before we knew it, my boys called me into the woman's room.

0:11:49.160,0:11:53.780
She started excreting a fibroid in the toilet.

0:11:53.780,0:11:56.580
We began to wonder what was happening.

0:11:56.580,0:12:04.700
It happened that there was a particular case - a friend who was a lodger.

0:12:04.700,0:12:11.220
He had a job appointment from one of these oil companies in Bayelsa, Nigeria.

0:12:11.220,0:12:14.140
They asked him to do medical tests, which he did.

0:12:14.140,0:12:19.520
He came back and was positive to HIV.

0:12:19.520,0:12:27.640
After coming to The SCOAN, he came back and he was insisting that I take him to any nearby hospital

0:12:27.640,0:12:32.380
so that he could do a test again and confirm his HIV status.

0:12:32.380,0:12:38.260
I drove him in my car; we went to Federal Medical Centre for a confirmation test.

0:12:38.260,0:12:44.740
I was baffled that the man who initially had a medical report,

0:12:44.740,0:12:48.100
stating that he was HIV positive, became negative.

0:12:48.100,0:12:51.300
All these things and many other things started happening.

0:12:51.300,0:12:55.820
I began to wonder because as a matter of truth and sincerity,

0:12:55.820,0:13:01.180
I was one of those men who actually criticized this ministry.

0:13:01.180,0:13:02.400
I must tell you that.

0:13:02.400,0:13:08.260
On seeing these miracles, I got the tapes of the man of God,

0:13:08.260,0:13:15.020
Prophet T.B. Joshua and started listening to them – the audio and video.

0:13:15.020,0:13:21.020
I was shocked at the wisdom, the insight into the interpretation of the Word of God.

0:13:21.020,0:13:29.280
The miracles moved me but the insight into the Scriptures was amazing.

0:13:29.280,0:13:34.540
There are portions of the Scripture that some ministers would not want to dive into and

0:13:34.540,0:13:40.040
you would see Prophet T.B. Joshua diving into them, treating them, counselling people on them

0:13:40.040,0:13:41.440
and it is wonderful.

0:13:41.440,0:13:44.080
He has been a blessing to me; I must tell you that.

0:13:44.080,0:13:48.480
Praise the Lord.

0:13:48.480,0:13:55.220
This continued and I began to reminisce in my heart; I began to have second thoughts.

0:13:55.220,0:13:59.000
I began to have a close study of the ministry.

0:13:59.000,0:14:07.940
It encouraged me and I decided that I was going to be a part of this ministry.

0:14:07.940,0:14:11.500
Last Sunday was a great day in my life.

0:14:11.500,0:14:20.660
I walked into this church and it was awesome when the wise men were going round.

0:14:20.660,0:14:25.760
Before Wise Man Daniel got to my row,

0:14:25.760,0:14:33.800
I was surprised that I felt some shivering inside of me; I was shaking.

0:14:33.800,0:14:36.340
I was wondering what was happening.

0:14:36.340,0:14:42.140
I knew I had no malaria parasite.

0:14:42.140,0:14:46.460
I began to wonder what was happening and lo and behold,

0:14:46.460,0:14:52.840
he placed his hand, first on my chest; it was like a bomb.

0:14:52.840,0:14:58.540
I had a ballistic missile explosion.

0:14:58.540,0:15:02.040
I was still staggering; I didn’t know what I was doing.

0:15:02.040,0:15:03.320
He touched my head again.

0:15:03.320,0:15:12.780
Before I knew it, I discovered I was talking but I didn't know what I was saying until

0:15:12.780,0:15:21.020
the final deliverance was conducted on me and I became a free man.

0:15:21.020,0:15:24.260
SCOAN Testimony

0:15:24.260,0:15:25.640
Emmanuel!

0:15:25.640,0:15:26.840
[God with us]

0:15:26.840,0:15:30.720
After the deliverance that day, I met with the counsellors.

0:15:30.720,0:15:34.260
I came here alone; I didn't come with her.

0:15:34.260,0:15:40.860
While I was still trying to grasp my movement, whether to be a part of this ministry or not,

0:15:40.860,0:15:45.380
I was always asking my wife to be a part so we could come together

0:15:45.380,0:15:50.460
but she never wanted to hear anything about The SCOAN.

0:15:50.460,0:15:53.140
I was surprised that the day after my deliverance,

0:15:53.140,0:15:57.880
my eldest daughter called me while I was still sitting in the church.

0:15:57.880,0:15:59.740
She asked, "Daddy, where are you?"

0:15:59.740,0:16:01.240
I said, "I am in the church".

0:16:01.240,0:16:03.540
She asked, "Which church?"
I said, "I am in The SCOAN".

0:16:03.540,0:16:06.500
She said she thought that my deliverance was genuine.

0:16:06.500,0:16:08.240
I asked her why she was saying that.

0:16:08.240,0:16:17.120
She said, "Mummy has just picked up all your clothes and she is outside washing them".

0:16:17.120,0:16:26.040
I was dumbfounded because that had never happened for many years.

0:16:26.040,0:16:37.540
When I got home, the following morning when she came to me, she said, "Daddy, good morning, sir".

0:16:37.540,0:16:41.200
Initially, I did not know she was the one talking.

0:16:41.200,0:16:45.080
She repeated it, "Daddy, I am saying good morning, sir".

0:16:45.080,0:16:50.960
I turned and laughed; I was happy.

0:16:50.960,0:16:57.120
Since then, she has changed.

0:16:57.120,0:17:00.760
I am so happy; I am testifying to that.

0:17:00.760,0:17:06.840
The people around me saw that something had just happened to me and my family.

0:17:06.840,0:17:07.980
Did you listen to that?

0:17:07.980,0:17:15.180
The deliverance that happened to our father affected the wife and everybody around.

0:17:15.180,0:17:17.560
Just only one person in the family.

0:17:17.560,0:17:28.320
Once a person in the family is delivered, every bondage and chain connected to the family is loosed.

0:17:28.320,0:17:32.960
I still have a second testimony that is so astonishing.

0:17:32.960,0:17:38.360
I had a family that visited us from Kano.

0:17:38.360,0:17:42.080
Their fifteen year old daughter had ran away from home

0:17:42.080,0:17:46.740
and for one month, we had been running helter skelter, looking for her.

0:17:46.740,0:17:51.600
On the day of my deliverance, after receiving the call from my daughter

0:17:51.600,0:17:54.920
that my wife had taken my clothes to wash,

0:17:54.920,0:18:00.800
I was surprised that the girl who had never been to Lagos, who doesn’t know anywhere in Lagos,

0:18:00.800,0:18:10.240
walked by herself back home on that day.

0:18:10.240,0:18:17.240
I am happy, fulfilled and have peace inside of me.

0:18:17.240,0:18:22.240
I think I have a brand new marriage now.
