You are wonderful 
You are worthy oh Lord

0:01:22.920,0:01:27.080
- Good morning, Church! 
- Good morning.

0:01:27.080,0:01:30.480
Emmanuel to viewers all over the world.

0:01:30.480,0:01:34.140
Thank you for your time.

0:01:34.140,0:01:37.580
God bless you.

0:01:37.580,0:01:40.460
You may be seated.

0:01:40.460,0:01:49.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:49.280,0:01:55.680
I want to believe that you are led here by the Holy Spirit.

0:01:55.680,0:01:57.540
Amen!

0:01:57.540,0:02:05.220
Can someone just come out and tell us how you were led here today by the Holy Spirit?

0:02:05.220,0:02:08.740
OK.

0:02:08.740,0:02:12.540
Clap for her.

0:02:12.540,0:02:13.780
You were led by what?

0:02:13.780,0:02:16.300
Husband.

0:02:16.300,0:02:20.660
Go and sit down.

0:02:20.660,0:02:24.960
Who was led by the wife?

0:02:24.960,0:02:27.960
You were led by your wife?

0:02:27.960,0:02:32.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:32.080,0:02:42.420
When you look at your life today; it is just the way our foundation started.

0:02:42.420,0:02:48.020
The beginning always has key leg.

0:02:48.020,0:02:49.900
Even to pray...

0:02:49.900,0:02:54.600
The way you started your prayer affects the whole prayer.

0:02:54.600,0:03:00.280
The way you come to church seems to affect your presence in the church.

0:03:00.280,0:03:01.560
It is just like that.

0:03:01.560,0:03:08.940
Even the way we start our business; we just look at our colleagues, someone who is making it,

0:03:08.940,0:03:11.580
whose business is going well.

0:03:11.580,0:03:17.060
Because of that you now choose to do the same business, which is very bad.

0:03:17.060,0:03:24.220
"Ah, that man is making it" - you will now walk towards the man, "Please, I want to invest in the same business."

0:03:24.220,0:03:29.860
The business you know about not seems to be good.

0:03:29.860,0:03:34.140
You approach the man, "Please, tell me how you started your business."

0:03:34.140,0:03:37.200
Even your education...

0:03:37.200,0:03:42.580
What you study in the university is a result of education of somebody, who is a minister of finance,

0:03:42.580,0:03:44.840
someone who is secretary general;

0:03:44.840,0:03:52.900
you want to go on internet to know what kind of subject... because of that you choose a course.

0:03:52.900,0:03:54.720
You want to be like that.

0:03:54.720,0:03:59.340
The beginning is always just the foundation affecting us.

0:03:59.340,0:04:10.820
Even our marriages today – the cause of collapsing, divorcing is as a result of how we met.

0:04:10.820,0:04:21.200
So, the beginning is just like that; it affects the whole structure.

0:04:21.200,0:04:23.340
Just like that.

0:04:23.340,0:04:26.480
Look at the children we give birth to.

0:04:26.480,0:04:32.340
Many of our children today; we can't tell, control, instruct, teach them, tell them what to do.

0:04:32.340,0:04:34.780
They become masters in the house.

0:04:34.780,0:04:41.640
Because of the beginning; the way we brought them up - the upbringing - we spoiled them.

0:04:41.640,0:04:47.880
We are not allowing them to taste some of the hard, difficult times we had in the past.

0:04:47.880,0:04:55.940
"These are my children, they must enjoy life. I suffered so much in life..."

0:04:55.940,0:05:01.660
By the time children grow up with that, they will think that life is all about bed of what?

0:05:01.660,0:05:02.900
Roses.

0:05:02.900,0:05:04.080
Life is not like that.

0:05:04.080,0:05:11.860
You have to allow them to taste some of the difficult parts of life.

0:05:11.860,0:05:17.920
Our beginning is the cause of what we are going through today.

0:05:17.920,0:05:26.880
We talk of worshipping God; many of us begin to understand what it means to worship God.

0:05:26.880,0:05:30.140
God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in what?

0:05:30.140,0:05:31.300
In Spirit and in truth.

0:05:31.300,0:05:35.240
But today; we never knew in the past...

0:05:35.240,0:05:45.140
We just go by the way our forefathers worshipped God – conventional.

0:05:45.140,0:05:51.380
It is there; the song to sing Him, how to do this...

0:05:51.380,0:05:57.100
Everything is in the syllabus; we are not allowing the Holy Spirit to inspire us.

0:05:57.100,0:05:59.420
Which area will the Holy Spirit inspire us

0:05:59.420,0:06:03.080
when everything we want to do is on the table, on the paper?

0:06:03.080,0:06:06.880
How will the Holy Spirit inspire us?

0:06:06.880,0:06:10.620
This virtually is our life.

0:06:10.620,0:06:17.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:17.860,0:06:22.420
Our life is full of copy – that is why we also, are copies.

0:06:22.420,0:06:26.280
Hardly will you see original or raw.

0:06:26.280,0:06:30.320
You cannot see raw again.

0:06:30.320,0:06:31.940
Material is what we are seeing.

0:06:31.940,0:06:34.060
Human beings have turned to material.

0:06:34.060,0:06:42.400
That is why we cannot invest, discover or bring a new thing to the world.

0:06:42.400,0:06:43.600
How will you?

0:06:43.600,0:06:50.540
You must be raw, original, the way God created you,

0:06:50.540,0:06:55.100
grow up and be inspired by your Creator.

0:06:55.100,0:06:59.780
From time to time you must be inspired by God

0:06:59.780,0:07:03.640
to change the world and be at the centre of your own world.

0:07:03.640,0:07:05.180
Are we inspired?

0:07:05.180,0:07:11.480
Everything about us today; your dress, hair, look...

0:07:11.480,0:07:16.460
We are sitting down, you are looking around to see the kind of attire - beautiful one.

0:07:16.460,0:07:20.580
When you leave here, you go to market and buy the same thing.

0:07:20.580,0:07:23.000
We leave here and go to be a copier.

0:07:23.000,0:07:30.000
You move around and see some posh cars, "This is a posh car. I think I need this vehicle.

0:07:30.000,0:07:34.100
Let me take the picture."

0:07:34.100,0:07:40.660
Copy, copy; we have become imitation of man, not imitation of God.

0:07:40.660,0:07:48.740
In religion, in Christianity, in our worship – imitation of man, not imitation of God.

0:07:48.740,0:07:53.180
In our walk - imitation of man, not imitation of God.

0:07:53.180,0:07:55.840
You learn how to smile.

0:07:55.840,0:08:04.640
The way you smile... - why can't you smile?

0:08:04.640,0:08:10.300
You see some of them; you can see the way he walks is not original, not real.

0:08:10.300,0:08:17.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:17.700,0:08:20.560
This is just what is happening now.

0:08:20.560,0:08:22.860
This has virtually affected our children.

0:08:22.860,0:08:37.620
The new generation today seems to be copies.

0:08:37.620,0:08:41.040
That has affected our relationship with God.

0:08:41.040,0:08:50.620
We now take our faith as a hobby, a game.

0:08:50.620,0:08:59.040
When I move to people to attend to them and hear them talking, you know where they are coming from.

0:08:59.040,0:09:01.440
The Bible is our standard.

0:09:01.440,0:09:05.200
It is just one Bible and the Holy Spirit is just one.

0:09:05.200,0:09:08.660
All over the world, there is one Holy Spirit.

0:09:08.660,0:09:13.780
The Holy Spirit operating here is the same Holy Spirit over there and all over the world.

0:09:13.780,0:09:21.440
As if the Holy Spirit is different - there is so much trouble.

0:09:21.440,0:09:27.200
That actually convinces me that the world is coming to an end.

0:09:27.200,0:09:32.020
With what we are seeing - so much.

0:09:32.020,0:09:36.540
Where do we start from, when people are copies?

0:09:36.540,0:09:41.240
Everything about you...

0:09:41.240,0:09:49.940
You have to study books to know how to pray - a lot of things...

0:09:49.940,0:09:57.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:57.720,0:10:13.400
Until we turn to imitate God Almighty, our Creator, we will not stop lamenting.

0:10:13.400,0:10:18.840
That crisis, lamenting, and others...

0:10:18.840,0:10:28.080
No matter how much blessings you have, how strong you are.

0:10:28.080,0:10:34.000
Faith is of man’s heart.

0:10:34.000,0:10:46.720
Every Word of God is Spirit and life and will work in you when you attend and act upon it.

0:10:46.720,0:10:49.560
Take note of that, "Spirit and life".

0:10:49.560,0:10:53.940
Since it is Spirit and life, there is no imitation of man there.

0:10:53.940,0:11:00.320
If somebody comes out to give testimony and says, "Praise the Lord!", you say, "Hallelujah!",

0:11:00.320,0:11:11.180
"When I received my morning water, I sprayed it this way... and I received a big contract";

0:11:11.180,0:11:17.580
you quickly write it down, "I sprayed it this way..."

0:11:17.580,0:11:21.700
Now, you walk towards the morning water to receive your own.

0:11:21.700,0:11:33.260
When you get home, you look at the paper, "I sprayed it this way...",

0:11:33.260,0:11:36.480
"OK - my contract is coming."

0:11:36.480,0:11:44.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:44.660,0:11:47.700
Salvation is of man’s heart.

0:11:47.700,0:11:54.320
Relationship with God is of man’s heart.

0:11:54.320,0:11:56.800
OK, now, we are here today.

0:11:56.800,0:12:03.080
You have read your Bible and right from nursery we know what the Bible says.

0:12:03.080,0:12:05.660
“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”

0:12:05.660,0:12:09.820
That is the standard; there is no other.

0:12:09.820,0:12:13.000
“Forgive us as we forgive those..." who what?

0:12:13.000,0:12:15.780
"... sin against us."

0:12:15.780,0:12:33.280
It means, let go of all unforgiveness, resentment, anger, bad feelings toward anyone but have you?

0:12:33.280,0:12:37.480
And you are here today to pray.

0:12:37.480,0:12:40.400
You are expecting God.

0:12:40.400,0:12:44.380
“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”

0:12:44.380,0:12:46.520
That is the standard; take note.

0:12:46.520,0:12:59.980
It means, let go of all unforgiveness, resentment, anger, bad feelings towards anyone.

0:12:59.980,0:13:10.920
But have you?
No.

0:13:10.920,0:13:16.900
What kind of hypocrisy!

0:13:16.900,0:13:20.300
Where are we going then?

0:13:20.300,0:13:25.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:25.680,0:13:37.000
Even if you receive and you have not put behind bad feelings toward anyone,

0:13:37.000,0:13:40.400
you will still lose that blessing.

0:13:40.400,0:13:47.240
You can receive; you cannot go with that blessing.

0:13:47.240,0:13:50.060
At the time you need that blessing you will lose it.

0:13:50.060,0:13:53.160
It is the standard.

0:13:53.160,0:13:57.120
At the time you need this blessing, you will lose it.

0:13:57.120,0:14:00.480
"Give us this day our daily bread."

0:14:00.480,0:14:04.020
What is our daily bread?

0:14:04.020,0:14:07.700
"Forgive us as we..."

0:14:07.700,0:14:11.440
Already, you have committed yourself.

0:14:11.440,0:14:14.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:14.840,0:14:19.000
We are here for prayer that comes from faith.

0:14:19.000,0:14:21.740
What is prayer that comes from faith?

0:14:21.740,0:14:25.540
Prayer that comes from faith heals the sick.

0:14:25.540,0:14:30.540
Prayer that comes from faith sets the captives free.

0:14:30.540,0:14:37.700
Prayer that comes from faith blesses the poor.

0:14:37.700,0:14:41.780
And if they have sinned, they will be forgiven.

0:14:41.780,0:14:46.260
That is prayer that comes from faith.

0:14:46.260,0:14:52.460
Tell your neighbour, “Prayer that comes from faith heals the sick.

0:14:52.460,0:14:57.780
Prayer that comes from faith sets the captives free.

0:14:57.780,0:15:02.380
Prayer that comes from faith blesses the poor.

0:15:02.380,0:15:10.620
And if they have sinned, they shall be forgiven."

0:15:10.620,0:15:14.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:14.700,0:15:15.880
That is what we are here for.

0:15:15.880,0:15:22.540
We are not just care for prayer for needs; but prayer that comes from faith.

0:15:22.540,0:15:28.100
Before we start; you see - everything is calm.

0:15:28.100,0:15:30.440
You will see people...

0:15:30.440,0:15:37.200
You will now say, "This lady was with me; we talked. What is wrong with her?"

0:15:37.200,0:15:40.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:40.580,0:15:47.700
That is prayer that comes from faith.

0:15:47.700,0:15:51.800
That is, prayer that comes from the heart.

0:15:51.800,0:15:54.420
- Prayer that comes from where?
- Heart.

0:15:54.420,0:16:02.200
Prayer can only come from the heart when your spirit acts upon the Word.

0:16:02.200,0:16:05.420
You want your prayer to come from your heart

0:16:05.420,0:16:11.640
but it is only when your spirit acts upon the Word

0:16:11.640,0:16:15.640
that you have the prayer that comes from the heart.

0:16:15.640,0:16:22.000
Prayer that comes from the heart is prayer that comes from faith because faith is of man's heart.

0:16:22.000,0:16:29.900
This heart consists of offence; you are full of offence.

0:16:29.900,0:16:37.000
Faith does not share the same apartment with anyone.

0:16:37.000,0:16:42.200
God cannot share the same apartment, the same heart.

0:16:42.200,0:16:51.440
But your heart is full of offence, unforgiveness, resentment and anger.

0:16:51.440,0:16:57.560
Your heart is full of bad feelings toward anyone.

0:16:57.560,0:17:03.320
Faith cannot share the same apartment with offence.

0:17:03.320,0:17:07.440
Faith cannot share the same apartment with unforgiveness.

0:17:07.440,0:17:11.480
Faith cannot share the same apartment with anger.

0:17:11.480,0:17:17.820
Faith cannot share the same place with bad feelings towards anyone.

0:17:17.820,0:17:19.780
So, what do you want to do now?

0:17:19.780,0:17:24.200
It’s either you choose faith or you choose offence.

0:17:24.200,0:17:29.400
It’s either you choose faith or you choose resentment or unforgiveness.

0:17:29.400,0:17:32.440
This is where we are now.

0:17:32.440,0:17:38.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:38.660,0:17:45.240
Prayer that comes from the heart – that is, prayer that comes from faith,

0:17:45.240,0:17:55.180
heals the sick, blesses the poor, sets the captives free.

0:17:55.180,0:18:07.600
If they have sinned, they will be forgiven – that is the prayer that comes from the heart.

0:18:07.600,0:18:09.300
Are you with me?

0:18:09.300,0:18:15.420
If they have sinned, and you are praying for them,

0:18:15.420,0:18:18.800
and the prayer comes from faith,

0:18:18.800,0:18:22.680
they will be forgiven instantly.

0:18:22.680,0:18:23.940
That is why you will be healed.

0:18:23.940,0:18:31.940
You cannot be healed without forgiveness because healing is for salvation of your soul.

0:18:31.940,0:18:36.680
If they have sinned, they will be forgiven instantly -

0:18:36.680,0:18:42.320
that is prayer that comes from the heart.

0:18:42.320,0:18:55.300
But your heart is full of offence, unforgiveness, anger, resentment, hurt and pain.

0:18:55.300,0:19:01.180
You may be right but we should not hold offence against anyone

0:19:01.180,0:19:05.740
because if you hold offence against anyone, it will imprison your heart.

0:19:05.740,0:19:16.000
Once your heart is imprisoned, you go nowhere – no relationship with God.

0:19:16.000,0:19:23.640
Can we just stand up and pour our hearts; if there is any pain of the past,

0:19:23.640,0:19:27.700
if there is any bad feeling towards anyone.

0:19:27.700,0:19:35.540
Right now, you can at this moment stand up and tell, "Lord Jesus".

0:19:35.540,0:19:41.880
Reconcile yourself.

0:19:41.880,0:19:47.200
Let go of all unforgiveness.

0:19:47.200,0:19:55.060
Let go of bad feelings towards anyone.

0:19:55.060,0:20:06.880
Let go of all resentment.

0:20:06.880,0:20:26.260
In Your presence I am content

0:20:26.260,0:20:39.820
In Your presence there is light 
Expressions of Your love

0:20:39.820,0:20:48.100
Revelations of Your power and might

0:20:48.100,0:21:09.080
In Your presence I can bring a love song offering
I’m in the presence of my King

0:21:09.080,0:21:21.500
In His presence, there is nothing like unforgiveness, resentment, anger

0:21:21.500,0:21:26.620
or bad feelings towards anyone.

0:21:26.620,0:21:35.420
Freedom, breakthrough, clearance – in His presence.

0:21:35.420,0:22:06.460
Hallowed be Your name

0:22:06.460,0:22:15.540
Lord and Majesty 
Divine authority

0:22:15.540,0:22:57.360
Hallowed be Your name

0:22:57.360,0:23:05.940
Lord and Majesty 
Divine authority

0:23:05.940,0:23:17.460
Hallowed be Your name

0:23:17.460,0:23:18.720
Yes.

0:23:18.720,0:23:26.000
As a child of God, you are to walk majestically.

0:23:26.000,0:23:40.600
Offence causes fear – fear of breakthrough, fear of sickness, fear of isolation.

0:23:40.600,0:23:46.200
When you have an appointment, you will be afraid whether they will hold that appointment.

0:23:46.200,0:23:51.000
If you have a clearance and you are asked to come for clearance,

0:23:51.000,0:23:54.280
you will be afraid whether you will receive the clearance.

0:23:54.280,0:23:57.820
When you want to sleep, you will be afraid of nightmares.

0:23:57.820,0:24:02.060
When you want to pray, you will be afraid whether your prayers will be answered.

0:24:02.060,0:24:12.400
Fear has been holding people in bondage.

0:24:12.400,0:24:15.460
The way fear rules people -

0:24:15.460,0:24:26.560
if that kind of fear ruled me, I would run away from Nigeria, because of what you people had done to me,

0:24:26.560,0:24:34.720
because of what you had said to me, what you had done to me - there is nothing you had not done to me.

0:24:34.720,0:24:42.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:42.640,0:24:53.160
Majesty
Worship His majesty

0:24:53.160,0:25:09.320
Unto Jesus
Be all glory honour and praise

0:25:09.320,0:25:21.080
Majesty Kingdom authority

0:25:21.080,0:25:34.420
Flows from His throne unto His own
His anthem reigns

0:25:34.420,0:25:47.320
So exalt lift up on high
The name of Jesus

0:25:47.320,0:26:01.840
Magnify come glorify 
Christ Jesus the king

0:26:01.840,0:26:13.380
Majesty
Worship His majesty

0:26:13.380,0:26:27.480
Jesus who died now glorified
King of all kings

0:26:27.480,0:26:35.720
With fear we will continue to swallow our vomit.

0:26:35.720,0:26:41.300
Fear will make you swallow your vomit; you take your vomit back.

0:26:41.300,0:26:47.420
Look at many of us here today, "Over my dead body will I come to Synagogue",

0:26:47.420,0:26:50.980
but we are in the Synagogue.

0:26:50.980,0:26:52.560
No!

0:26:52.560,0:26:55.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:55.720,0:26:58.360
That is fear.

0:26:58.360,0:27:02.720
What you say you would not do, you find yourself doing.

0:27:02.720,0:27:06.340
When you say you would not go, you find yourself going there, because of offence.

0:27:06.340,0:27:11.140
That offence in our heart causes fear.

0:27:11.140,0:27:19.740
When you hold offence, bad feelings towards anyone, whether the person is right or wrong,

0:27:19.740,0:27:26.320
whether you are right or wrong and somebody abuses or cheats you -

0:27:26.320,0:27:31.720
whatever anyone might have done to you and you hold bad feelings towards him -

0:27:31.720,0:27:36.020
you will continue to live a life of fear.

0:27:36.020,0:27:41.880
You know, you maybe right, and you know something is done to you,

0:27:41.880,0:27:48.620
and you know you are right, and you are holding bad feeling toward anyone...

0:27:48.620,0:27:55.140
When I say ‘anyone’ – the accused and accuser.

0:27:55.140,0:28:04.460
Holding bad feelings toward anyone – you will continue to live life with fear.

0:28:04.460,0:28:08.220
Fear robs us of our blessings.

0:28:08.220,0:28:10.640
You will not be able to give your best.

0:28:10.640,0:28:13.360
That is why we cannot give our best.

0:28:13.360,0:28:15.640
You are always afraid.

0:28:15.640,0:28:19.560
God is not of fear but of love.

0:28:19.560,0:28:24.020
Where are we going and what is the cause of this fear?

0:28:24.020,0:28:27.700
Bad feelings towards anyone.

0:28:27.700,0:28:42.600
Tell your neighbour, “What is the cause of fear? Bad feelings towards anyone.”

0:28:42.600,0:28:52.560
You say, "Ah, he cheated me. I will not forgive him. He is very bad. I helped him; he dooped me.

0:28:52.560,0:29:01.980
I loaned him money. Hear what this man is saying about me; he calls me thief, he embarrasses me."

0:29:01.980,0:29:06.700
Bad feelings towards anyone...

0:29:06.700,0:29:10.400
You continue to live a life of fear.

0:29:10.400,0:29:13.820
A life of fear is a life of destruction.

0:29:13.820,0:29:21.200
If you cannot believe a man you can see, is it a man you cannot see you will believe?

0:29:21.200,0:29:28.900
If you cannot believe what you can see, definitely, you cannot believe God.

0:29:28.900,0:29:38.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:38.140,0:29:44.280
You don't believe yourself; when you dream, you have to see many people for interpretation.

0:29:44.280,0:29:50.800
Because you don't believe yourself; there is a promotion in that dream for you,

0:29:50.800,0:29:52.880
"Let me go and ask people".

0:29:52.880,0:29:56.260
Because you don't believe anything good can come from you.

0:29:56.260,0:30:06.620
You say, "My pastor, please, I dreamt about the promotion..." - because you don't believe yourself.

0:30:06.620,0:30:07.700
Where are we going?

0:30:07.700,0:30:10.180
How do we get out of this mess?

0:30:10.180,0:30:14.800
We get out of this mess by stopping holding what?

0:30:14.800,0:30:15.780
Offences.

0:30:15.780,0:30:20.620
Whether your offence is too big; I don't want to use word 'offence' again.

0:30:20.620,0:30:25.960
Simple: bad feelings towards anyone.

0:30:25.960,0:30:30.180
If you say that, you know it covers all.

0:30:30.180,0:30:40.740
For you to get there, where God promised you, bad feelings towards anyone – stop it!

0:30:40.740,0:30:49.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:49.360,0:30:52.100
You keep singing this song...

0:30:52.100,0:30:55.480
Leave it for God
Don’t worry yourself

0:30:55.480,0:30:59.920
Leave it for God
Don’t cry no more

0:30:59.920,0:31:01.480
What is the meaning of that?

0:31:01.480,0:31:07.160
Bad feelings towards anyone; that is the meaning.

0:31:07.160,0:31:12.900
Somebody slaps you, you say, "Why do you slap me?"

0:31:12.900,0:31:18.280
And now, you hold offence; that is bad feeling towards...

0:31:18.280,0:31:20.740
Leave it for God.

0:31:20.740,0:31:26.420
I'm a good example of "leave it for God"; my name is "Leave it for God".

0:31:26.420,0:31:28.980
Prophet "Leave it for God".

0:31:28.980,0:31:32.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:32.880,0:31:35.500
That is me for you.

0:31:35.500,0:31:37.760
I know what I'm doing.

0:31:37.760,0:31:40.400
You think I cannot fight?

0:31:40.400,0:31:44.960
My name is "Leave it for God".

0:31:44.960,0:31:46.860
I will just look at you and...

0:31:46.860,0:31:53.800
Sometimes, when it is too painful, I will say...

0:31:53.800,0:31:58.980
I will not allow this to affect my future.

0:31:58.980,0:32:10.120
The future is very clear – clear and bright.

0:32:10.120,0:32:15.440
Why should I allow anything to stain that future?

0:32:15.440,0:32:19.320
The only way they can stain it is to attack and insult you.

0:32:19.320,0:32:23.720
Your answer to that insult will stain the future.

0:32:23.720,0:32:28.160
Don't trade anything with what?

0:32:28.160,0:32:32.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:32.840,0:32:38.660
Don’t ever trade anything with the future.

0:32:38.660,0:32:42.780
Suffer now and enjoy tomorrow.

0:32:42.780,0:32:49.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:49.360,0:32:52.380
So, please...

0:32:52.380,0:32:56.680
"Be patient for the future" - tell your neighbour.

0:32:56.680,0:32:59.200
That is the answer.

0:32:59.200,0:33:00.860
Be patient for what?

0:33:00.860,0:33:01.860
Future.

0:33:01.860,0:33:03.660
We are not patient for the future.

0:33:03.660,0:33:06.100
You are in a hurry.

0:33:06.100,0:33:10.940
"I will answer. No, I have to fight. I have to defend myself." - No!

0:33:10.940,0:33:15.340
A time is coming – your future will answer them.

0:33:15.340,0:33:22.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:22.120,0:33:25.280
Do you know the reason I said, “Be patient for your future”?

0:33:25.280,0:33:27.840
Because your future will answer them.

0:33:27.840,0:33:31.080
Unanswered questions – the future will answer.

0:33:31.080,0:33:35.360
There are many things, "How would you defend yourself? How would you answer?" - No!

0:33:35.360,0:33:41.440
If you can be patient, that future will answer your critics.

0:33:41.440,0:33:47.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:47.560,0:33:56.160
Tell your neighbour, “Be patient – your future will answer your critics.”

0:33:56.160,0:34:03.740
That is when God will set a table before you and every essential of life will be on the table.

0:34:03.740,0:34:11.940
The table will answer your critics but you are not patient for your future.

0:34:11.940,0:34:16.920
Future we are speaking of is not here or there; future is next.

0:34:16.920,0:34:19.420
An hour to come, a second to come.

0:34:19.420,0:34:23.200
Your life can change any moment from now.

0:34:23.200,0:34:28.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:28.740,0:34:37.100
When we say future, people think, "10 years; I cannot wait. I'm still a student, undergraduate,

0:34:37.100,0:34:43.640
I'm unemployed, I don't have job, I'm homeless. What kind of future again?

0:34:43.640,0:34:50.280
How will I arrange my future? I don't know where I'm going. What future this man is talking about?"

0:34:50.280,0:35:01.340
Future belongs to God and future is what we call mystery.

0:35:01.340,0:35:04.180
How it happens – you don’t know.

0:35:04.180,0:35:08.400
It's just this...

0:35:08.400,0:35:11.200
Can you count how many seconds?

0:35:11.200,0:35:19.960
Your future; next is this, next -this...

0:35:19.960,0:35:24.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:24.820,0:35:27.900
The glory – many have lost it.

0:35:27.900,0:35:29.300
We have to be frank.

0:35:29.300,0:35:31.940
We got it before and we lost it.

0:35:31.940,0:35:38.300
But God is merciful; don’t give up.

0:35:38.300,0:35:43.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:43.860,0:35:48.280
If you have lost it, that is not the end.

0:35:48.280,0:35:51.280
Please, I want to leave you here.

0:35:51.280,0:35:53.500
In summary:

0:35:53.500,0:35:59.140
please, be patient for your future.

0:35:59.140,0:36:03.420
Your future will answer your critics.

0:36:03.420,0:36:07.600
Your future will answer your enemies.

0:36:07.600,0:36:14.640
Your future will answer your adversaries.

0:36:14.640,0:36:29.500
Because He lives
I can face tomorrow

0:36:29.500,0:36:45.440
Because He lives
All fear is gone

0:36:45.440,0:37:01.620
Because I know
He holds my future

0:37:01.620,0:37:21.260
My life is worth living
Just because He lives

0:37:21.260,0:37:23.820
Be patient for your future.

0:37:23.820,0:37:33.000
The evidence of coming of your future will make your enemy to surrender.

0:37:33.000,0:37:35.460
They will surrender.

0:37:35.460,0:37:39.920
The evidence is so powerful.

0:37:39.920,0:37:56.400
A stone which a builder rejected will become the real cornerstone.

0:37:56.400,0:37:59.760
That is the future.

0:37:59.760,0:38:06.020
They reject you and call you names because they don’t know what is about to come.

0:38:06.020,0:38:09.420
There is a mystery somewhere waiting.

0:38:09.420,0:38:13.880
Reject you; this is how God does it.

0:38:13.880,0:38:22.980
He always allows enemies and critics to embarrass because of what is coming.

0:38:22.980,0:38:25.380
Be patient for your future.

0:38:25.380,0:38:32.640
This is the time you should expect embarrassment.

0:38:32.640,0:38:35.780
This will prepare you for the future.

0:38:35.780,0:38:39.140
Embarrassment will prepare you for the future.

0:38:39.140,0:38:42.580
Name-calling will prepare you for the future.

0:38:42.580,0:38:51.740
Whatever you are going through is to prepare you for the future; be strong.

0:38:51.740,0:38:53.480
That is it.

0:38:53.480,0:38:58.260
So, what you are going through is to prepare you for the future.

0:38:58.260,0:39:03.240
Pleasure cannot prepare you; pleasure will destroy you more.

0:39:03.240,0:39:06.900
This is not the time to talk of pleasure.

0:39:06.900,0:39:09.060
You want to be strong -

0:39:09.060,0:39:19.200
you need much of hard times, less of good times to prepare you for the war.

0:39:19.200,0:39:21.640
Unless you have arrived. 
Have you arrived?

0:39:21.640,0:39:23.040
No.

0:39:23.040,0:39:24.700
What are you talking about?

0:39:24.700,0:39:27.000
You have not yet arrived.

0:39:27.000,0:39:30.760
You are still struggling and striving.

0:39:30.760,0:39:36.480
This is the right time to go through what you are going through -

0:39:36.480,0:39:42.760
sickness, hardship, name-calling, rejection, isolation.

0:39:42.760,0:39:44.920
This is the right time.

0:39:44.920,0:39:50.040
They will prepare you for the future; you will become stronger.

0:39:50.040,0:39:55.420
Your struggles will make you stronger.

0:39:55.420,0:39:57.120
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

0:39:57.120,0:40:02.860
Give thanks to God, give thanks to Him.

0:40:02.860,0:40:05.300
You may be seated.

0:40:05.300,0:40:09.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:09.160,0:40:10.280
Yes.

0:40:10.280,0:40:13.960
Take note – be patient for your future.

0:40:13.960,0:40:17.300
Your future will answer your enemies.

0:40:17.300,0:40:21.220
Your future will answer your critics.

0:40:21.220,0:40:26.720
The evidence will be overwhelming!

0:40:26.720,0:40:33.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:33.000,0:40:40.460
If you believe you are too old for the future I'm talking about; God is prepared to add more to your age.

0:40:40.460,0:40:44.220
Amen.

0:40:44.220,0:40:58.220
Begin right now to let go of all unforgiveness, bad feelings towards anyone.

0:40:58.220,0:41:03.540
Anyone means accused and accuser.

0:41:03.540,0:41:14.520
Bad feelings - "I have bad feelings towards this man. The man is wicked. The man has dooped me.

0:41:14.520,0:41:19.880
No, I don't want to hear his voice. That is his number - delete it."

0:41:19.880,0:41:28.460
It will imprison your spirit and you need a free spirit to relate with God,

0:41:28.460,0:41:33.060
to relate with the Holy Spirit because your spirit will join itself.

0:41:33.060,0:41:38.060
When your spirit is imprisoned, how will you relate with God?

0:41:38.060,0:41:41.520
From this moment, make yourself available.

0:41:41.520,0:41:45.300
In your heart first, settle yourself.

0:41:45.300,0:41:51.720
Even your critics will not know that you have forgiven, but your heart - you have nothing.

0:41:51.720,0:41:55.400
One day, when they come across you, they will know that you are for them.

0:41:55.400,0:41:57.680
You are not against.

0:41:57.680,0:42:02.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:42:02.500,0:42:06.040
This is how you will begin to prepare for your future.

0:42:06.040,0:42:15.200
It is like someone, who is about to wed, and the celebration is next week,

0:42:15.200,0:42:18.680
but he is fighting people now.

0:42:18.680,0:42:23.400
They may likely kill him before that time.

0:42:23.400,0:42:25.960
They will likely kill him.

0:42:25.960,0:42:29.640
When you are celebrating; you know your celebration is next week,

0:42:29.640,0:42:36.060
anything like fight comes your way - you will know that it is a work of an enemy.

0:42:36.060,0:42:41.260
I will be wedding next week, "Look! This is a work of an enemy."

0:42:41.260,0:42:46.980
You stay cool and calm, because you know that something is about to come.

0:42:46.980,0:42:50.980
What is about to come is why the enemy is doing all this.

0:42:50.980,0:42:53.300
They want to destroy what is about to come.

0:42:53.300,0:42:57.960
That is exactly your future - your life.

0:42:57.960,0:43:04.780
What you are doing now; if you don't let go of all your unforgiveness,

0:43:04.780,0:43:12.620
one will likely be destroyed before the future comes.

0:43:12.620,0:43:18.400
One may not die, but one will be on the sick bed.

0:43:18.400,0:43:26.220
One may not die, but one will have a disease and sickness that will make the future not enjoyable.

0:43:26.220,0:43:30.020
One will not die but one would be in the prison yard.

0:43:30.020,0:43:32.000
A lot of things happened like that.

0:43:32.000,0:43:36.600
By the time the future comes, they say, "Oh, you are destroyed already."

0:43:36.600,0:43:41.860
We go to the future, not that the future comes to us.

0:43:41.860,0:43:49.020
Not that you sit down and say, "Future come!" - no, you will go to future.

0:43:49.020,0:43:59.720
With forgiveness, humility, love, faithfulness, you will go to the future.

0:43:59.720,0:44:04.840
Let someone say, “My future is coming!”

0:44:04.840,0:44:15.280
When you say your future is coming – your arrival, your settlement, your clearance.

0:44:15.280,0:44:22.240
Then, many will depend on you.

0:44:22.240,0:44:27.440
Many will depend on you, so many will depend on you.

0:44:27.440,0:44:31.040
My future is coming.

0:44:31.040,0:44:35.400
Let go of all offence.

0:44:35.400,0:44:38.900
My future is coming.

0:44:38.900,0:44:44.740
If you don’t let go of all offence, it will affect that future.

0:44:44.740,0:44:52.160
Your future will continue to be postponed.

0:44:52.160,0:44:59.000
Don't be surprised; by the time one gets there, they will open the file and show you,

0:44:59.000,0:45:05.100
"You are a king but you spent all your life on the street.

0:45:05.100,0:45:15.940
You are a president of a country but you spent all your life at the garage.

0:45:15.940,0:45:23.840
You are destined to be very rich but you spent all your life begging on the streets" - you will just see it in the file.

0:45:23.840,0:45:26.360
They will be telling you what you are destined to do.

0:45:26.360,0:45:33.140
You are destined to be rich, to be president of a country, to be this, to be that,

0:45:33.140,0:45:42.760
but they will open the file, "Look at yourself; you are begging, you are a beggar."

0:45:42.760,0:45:47.680
You will say, "Ah!" - you will be very surprised, that what you were destined to do

0:45:47.680,0:45:51.660
is different from what you went to do.

0:45:51.660,0:45:59.140
Because of offence, fight, disagreement, bad feelings towards anyone.

0:45:59.140,0:46:01.980
There is no way God can communicate with you.

0:46:01.980,0:46:06.340
He can only communicate with you through your heart, your spirit

0:46:06.340,0:46:20.880
but your spirit is full of offence, unforgiveness, anger, resentment, bad feelings toward anyone.

0:46:20.880,0:46:27.520
This is why many people today, when they realize that there is no way to go because of bad feeling,

0:46:27.520,0:46:34.820
they join cults, secret societies; they can do anything.

0:46:34.820,0:46:36.360
So, please.

0:46:36.360,0:46:47.860
Begin to believe in God’s authority now because you believe so much in majority.

0:46:47.860,0:46:56.780
Get yourself right with God; you can now move with the majority.

0:46:56.780,0:46:57.280
