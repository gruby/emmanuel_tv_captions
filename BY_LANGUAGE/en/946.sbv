0:00:00.860,0:00:03.240
Madam, how are you?

0:00:03.240,0:00:05.700
You have the spirit of suicide.

0:00:05.700,0:00:06.460
Yes.

0:00:06.460,0:00:08.240
You want to commit suicide.

0:00:08.240,0:00:10.600
Yes, sir.

0:00:10.600,0:00:13.600
You have depression - serious depression

0:00:13.600,0:00:14.800
Yes, serious depression.

0:00:14.800,0:00:17.740
Three times you attempted to commit suicide.

0:00:17.740,0:00:19.020
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:19.020,0:00:21.580
Your family serves gods.

0:00:21.580,0:00:22.900
Yes.

0:00:22.900,0:00:25.780
Strong gods. They serve gods.

0:00:25.780,0:00:27.740
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:27.740,0:00:29.560
Why do you want to commit suicide?

0:00:29.560,0:00:37.600
Because I was depressed and encountered a lot of difficulties in my life

0:00:37.600,0:00:45.600
and I just felt that there are times I cannot cope.

0:00:45.600,0:00:52.000
I feel that many people are against me and I don't know them at all.

0:00:52.000,0:00:57.400
But I really feel that they are against me, and I also don't know why.

0:00:57.400,0:00:58.560
Come on.

0:00:58.560,0:01:05.180
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:01:05.180,0:01:10.820
I command every spirit and I command them out in the name of Jesus -

0:01:10.820,0:01:17.120
the spirit of suicide and depression caused by generational curses.

0:01:17.120,0:01:23.860
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:01:23.860,0:01:25.120
She is free.

0:01:25.120,0:01:27.600
Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:27.600,0:01:31.580
TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:31.580,0:01:34.980
My name is Evelyn and I come from Malaysia.

0:01:34.980,0:01:44.060
Last week, the man of God prophesied to me that I had the spirit of committing suicide,

0:01:44.060,0:01:50.100
serious depression and that my family serves gods.

0:01:50.100,0:02:05.840
They are taoists. They worship three idols at my house and they are conventional Chinese gods.

0:02:05.840,0:02:12.980
The name of the god is ... and another one is ancestral spirit.

0:02:12.980,0:02:17.360
Another one is the god of lands.

0:02:17.360,0:02:24.500
I was brought up worshipping these gods from when I was very young.

0:02:24.500,0:02:30.660
I would burn incense and offer it to these gods.

0:02:30.680,0:02:43.300
I would offer a sacrifice like roasted chicken, vegetables and also fruits to the idols.

0:02:43.300,0:02:49.260
Exactly as Prophet T.B. Joshua said that there were some gods that our sister's family worshipped

0:02:49.260,0:02:54.420
She's explaining that right from a young age, she was brought up worshiping three different gods

0:02:54.420,0:02:58.580
and making sacrifices to them. Now tell us - as you were growing up,

0:02:58.580,0:03:01.220
how did this begin to affect your life negatively?

0:03:01.220,0:03:06.340
I have been suffering from depression for many years.

0:03:06.340,0:03:12.360
I have always been wanting to commit suicide.

0:03:12.360,0:03:22.380
There is one time that I almost wanted to go and jump off from a ten to twenty storey building in Singapore.

0:03:22.380,0:03:32.620
There are many times that I tried to kill myself with a knive and get hit by a car.

0:03:32.620,0:03:37.380
What was it that was pushing you to attempt suicide?

0:03:37.380,0:03:46.620
I kept on hearing voices that I'm a useless person.

0:03:46.620,0:03:53.820
I might just as well die. That there was no hope and nothing inside of me.

0:03:53.820,0:04:00.240
I did not possess anything. I had no career and no marriage. I should just go and die.

0:04:00.240,0:04:05.580
So you would hear these voices talking to you, pushing you into attempting suicide.

0:04:05.580,0:04:09.120
You said that you've attempted suicide on many occasions.

0:04:09.120,0:04:11.060
Yes, on many occasions.

0:04:11.060,0:04:23.060
Whenever I was at home or at work, the thoughts would just come that I should commit suicide.

0:04:23.060,0:04:25.240
You mentioned depression as well.

0:04:25.250,0:04:30.140
How did that depression - apart from pushing you to attempt suicide - affect you

0:04:30.900,0:04:34.740
in your relationships and work? How did that depression really affect?

0:04:34.740,0:04:40.820
It lead to failure in my career.

0:04:40.820,0:04:46.580
Many times I had to resign from my work.

0:04:46.580,0:04:51.800
I also did not have a good relationship with other people.

0:04:51.800,0:04:57.340
So the depression really made me to face a lot of difficulties in my life.

0:04:57.340,0:05:01.740
But thank God that I was delivered and I'm delivered.

0:05:01.740,0:05:04.960
Hallelujah! Now before talking about your deliverance, we want to find out -

0:05:04.960,0:05:10.240
how did you come to find out about The SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua?

0:05:10.240,0:05:14.120
You said you came all the way from Malaysia, Asia, to be here.

0:05:14.120,0:05:18.540
How did you initially discover this ministry?

0:05:18.540,0:05:25.940
When I was a buddhist 14 years ago, at the age of 16,

0:05:25.940,0:05:30.440
I had a friend who is a Christian.

0:05:30.440,0:05:38.700
She gave me a CD of this ministry, of Prophet T.B. Joshua performing miracles.

0:05:38.700,0:05:42.700
God is performing miracles through the man of God.

0:05:42.700,0:05:49.100
There are many healings and miracles that I witnessed with my own eyes through the CD.

0:05:49.100,0:05:51.980
At that time I did not commit myself to Christ.

0:05:51.980,0:05:55.740
I just wondered, "Wow, such miracles!

0:05:55.740,0:06:04.560
There is really a God in this world!" But I was a Buddhist at that time.

0:06:05.880,0:06:12.420
After I witnessed these miracles, I started to believe that there is a God in this world

0:06:12.420,0:06:16.540
and I asked my Christian friends to take me to church.

0:06:16.540,0:06:24.040
Eventually, I became a Christian after witnessing the works of the man of God.

0:06:24.040,0:06:31.880
14 years ago, someone gave you a CD which contained clips from this ministry, The SCOAN.

0:06:31.880,0:06:32.540
Yes.

0:06:32.540,0:06:34.700
Wow! So we can just imagine what our sister is saying -

0:06:34.700,0:06:40.640
right there in Malaysia, she actually saw the video clips of this ministry 14 years ago.

0:06:40.640,0:06:44.200
At that time, she had another faith; she was not a Christian.

0:06:44.200,0:06:49.520
But the miracles she saw actually convinced her that Jesus Christ was alive

0:06:49.520,0:06:53.240
and that led her to the point of becoming a Christian later on.

0:06:53.240,0:06:57.880
So tell us - how did you now come to be here today?

0:06:57.880,0:07:05.240
I've been trying to come here for many times but I was always facing difficulties,

0:07:05.240,0:07:08.380
like "Oh, never mind! You don't need to come!"

0:07:08.380,0:07:13.160
"You don't have the money to book the flight ticket' or "Never mind, you just sit at home

0:07:13.160,0:07:21.060
and you can watch the screen". But at one point in time before I came, I had a dream.

0:07:21.060,0:07:27.020
I saw the man of God. He prophesied to me, and he delivered me.

0:07:27.020,0:07:31.300
So this was my decision to eventually come here.

0:07:31.300,0:07:35.220
Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:07:35.220,0:07:40.860
So even before physically coming to The SCOAN, you saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in a dream

0:07:40.860,0:07:44.220
and God used him to prophesy and to deliver you.

0:07:44.220,0:07:47.580
When you finally came, tell us - what happened to you last week?

0:07:47.580,0:07:53.060
When he prophesied and prayed for me, I felt that...

0:07:53.060,0:07:59.840
When he touched me, I thought there was lightning and a bolt that struck my head

0:07:59.840,0:08:04.040
and then immediately I fell down.

0:08:04.040,0:08:08.620
Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:08.620,0:08:13.260
So the exact problem you came all the way from Malaysia with, was this spirit of suicide,

0:08:13.260,0:08:18.140
this spirit of depression. The man of God walked up to you and gave you that exact prophecy -

0:08:18.140,0:08:23.160
exactly as you'd seen happen in your dream, even before coming here.

0:08:23.160,0:08:24.200
Yes.

0:08:24.200,0:08:29.360
And then he prayed for you. Now ever since the prayer you received, just tell us what has happened to your life.

0:08:29.360,0:08:37.580
Ever since last week that the man of God prophesied to me, I have no thoughts of committing suicide at all.

0:08:37.580,0:08:43.380
Even when I feel bad at times, I no longer have thoughts of committing suicide at all.

0:08:43.380,0:08:44.400
Thank God.

0:08:44.400,0:08:48.760
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:08:48.760,0:08:52.980
Apart from suicidal thoughts that have gone, how have you been relating with others?

0:08:52.980,0:08:56.880
You said before that you were always depressed but since that deliverance last week,

0:08:56.880,0:08:59.520
how has your life been?

0:08:59.520,0:09:08.900
I've become happier, and I do not hold grudges towards other people.

0:09:08.900,0:09:13.240
Thank You, Jesus Christ. This is the evidence of the deliverance that our sister received last week.

0:09:13.240,0:09:16.040
We can see on the screen how she received that word of prophecy -

0:09:16.040,0:09:19.940
the exact problem she came here all the way from Malaysia with.

0:09:19.940,0:09:22.900
We give glory to God that she's here as a living testimony today

0:09:22.900,0:09:28.460
because this issue of committing suicide and depression is a problem that so many people,

0:09:28.460,0:09:31.540
especially young people all over the world, are suffering from.

0:09:31.540,0:09:37.200
Our sister had that problem before. She said that she had attempted suicide so many times,

0:09:37.200,0:09:41.960
to the point of even trying to jump off a 20-storey building but today she is delivered.

0:09:41.960,0:09:48.580
We want to ask you sister: What is your advice to people out there who also have that same problem?

0:09:48.580,0:09:52.580
They're depressed. They're feeling of committing suicide, attempting suicide.

0:09:52.580,0:09:57.180
What do you want to advise them based on your own deliverance?

0:09:57.180,0:10:01.720
Depression comes from holding a grudge towards others.

0:10:01.720,0:10:07.480
So my advice is: Do not hold a grudge towards your neighbours or your enemies.

0:10:07.480,0:10:10.800
Love your neighbours and your enemies and pray for them.

0:10:10.800,0:10:17.180
Then you won't be committing suicide, you won't have the thoughts of committing suicide anymore.

0:10:17.180,0:10:21.080
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:21.080,0:10:25.540
Sister, you said before that you were hearing a voice that was speaking to you,

0:10:25.540,0:10:29.600
always pushing you to attempt suicide, to kill yourself, to end it all.

0:10:29.600,0:10:32.300
Just describe - since your deliverance last week,

0:10:32.300,0:10:39.140
what are the changes you've experienced in your mind, in your heart now concerning that voice?

0:10:39.140,0:10:43.460
I don't hear any voice that asks me to commit suicide anymore.

0:10:43.460,0:10:51.260
Instead I hear voices of encouraging me in prayer and in loving others.

0:10:51.260,0:10:54.700
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:54.700,0:10:59.600
This is the evidence of our sister's deliverance that spirits that were pushing her to commit suicide,

0:10:59.600,0:11:05.100
that had entered her right from a young age as a result of the gods that her family worshipped

0:11:05.100,0:11:09.140
left her after the deliverance and today, we thank God that she's free

0:11:09.140,0:11:11.580
and no longer has any thoughts of committing suicide.

0:11:11.580,0:11:15.840
One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:11:15.840,0:11:19.760
So right now sister, what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?

0:11:19.760,0:11:24.920
My advice is: Get used to challenges.

0:11:24.920,0:11:32.920
God has not promised that we as Christians will not encounter challenges

0:11:32.920,0:11:38.240
but the way that we handle the challenges will determine our future.

0:11:38.240,0:11:42.600
Love your neighbours and love your enemies as yourself,

0:11:42.600,0:11:47.720
and there will always be hope in you in Christ Jesus.

0:11:47.720,0:11:52.540
Amen.  Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
