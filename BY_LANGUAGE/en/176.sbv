GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING

0:00:05.400,0:00:16.260
On Sunday, the 28th of July 2013, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message concerning an Asian nation -

0:00:16.260,0:00:22.980
warning them of an incident, involving a large aircraft, carrying over 200 people,

0:00:22.980,0:00:26.160
developing a fault soon after take off.

0:00:26.160,0:00:29.100
He subsequently prayed for the nation.

0:00:29.100,0:00:31.220
These were his words:

0:00:32.300,0:00:35.600
In Jesus Christ' name.

0:00:35.600,0:00:36.980
We have to pray!

0:00:36.980,0:00:39.420
This is an Asian country.

0:00:39.420,0:00:41.980
I will not mention any country but God showed me the country.

0:00:41.980,0:00:45.980
I am seeing a very big balloon.

0:00:45.980,0:00:48.160
What is the  cause of this?

0:00:48.160,0:00:53.660
It was just about to take off and the fault started.

0:00:53.660,0:01:03.020
It means that they can discover it on the tarmac but because of impatience.

0:01:03.020,0:01:06.360
If God gives me the grace, I will send a letter to the embassy of the country.

0:01:06.360,0:01:14.080
Check your airlines in your country,

0:01:14.080,0:01:20.980
It is going to be huge - almost 200 people inside.

0:01:20.980,0:01:23.520
What happened here?

0:01:23.520,0:01:27.740
It is the fault of impatience

0:01:27.740,0:01:31.680
because there are many things they need to look into before they take off

0:01:31.680,0:01:34.660
but they are unable.

0:01:34.660,0:01:36.500
What is the cause?

0:01:36.500,0:01:39.080
Two hundred people are inside the plane.

0:01:39.080,0:01:42.220
This is an Asian country.

0:01:42.220,0:01:46.120
We are going to pray for them and I will see what I can do

0:01:46.120,0:01:48.760
to send a letter to the embassy and let them know

0:01:48.760,0:01:56.560
that they should inspect any plane on their tarmac before it moves.

0:01:56.560,0:02:05.200
Take cognisance, take note so that they can avert this.

0:02:05.200,0:02:08.340
In Jesus Christ' name.
