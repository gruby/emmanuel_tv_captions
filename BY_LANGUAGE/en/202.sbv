STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:05.800,0:00:07.800
As wiseman Daniel moves along

0:00:07.820,0:00:10.200
The SCOAN prayer line ministering prayer

0:00:10.200,0:00:12.260
in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:00:12.260,0:00:15.480
see how the people move uncontrollably
 as the Holy Ghost fire

0:00:15.480,0:00:17.920
begins to consume every power of darkness

0:00:17.920,0:00:19.180
in their lives,

0:00:19.180,0:00:22.440
for where the light of God is,
 darkness has no hiding place.

0:00:22.440,0:00:24.740
See the reaction of this woman

0:00:24.740,0:00:26.160
as the contrary spirit inside of her

0:00:26.160,0:00:28.200
is exposed.

0:00:28.200,0:00:30.380
Fire in the mighty name of Jesus! Who are you?

0:00:30.380,0:00:31.460
Stop it!

0:00:31.460,0:00:32.620
Stop what?

0:00:32.620,0:00:35.040
Stop embarrassing me.

0:00:35.040,0:00:38.060
I am a journalist, I am the one who embarrasses people.

0:00:38.060,0:00:39.360
Okay!

0:00:39.360,0:00:41.100
You won't embarrass me!

0:00:41.100,0:00:43.000
You are a journalist?

0:00:43.000,0:00:45.380
I am the one who embarrasses people.

0:00:45.380,0:00:48.600
What do you mean by that?

0:00:48.600,0:00:51.220
I make fun of people who come here,

0:00:51.220,0:00:53.980
I write about them.

0:00:53.980,0:00:56.800
What are the things you say?

0:00:56.800,0:00:59.140
I make fun of the things they do and they say.

0:00:59.140,0:01:01.460
I am a journalist.

0:01:01.460,0:01:05.980
Nobody makes fun of me, I make fun of the people.

0:01:05.980,0:01:07.080
Stop this!

0:01:07.080,0:01:10.140
What have you done to her?

0:01:10.140,0:01:12.980
She is my wife now.

0:01:12.980,0:01:15.980
I married her long time ago.

0:01:15.980,0:01:20.140
I entered her through sexual abuse.

0:01:20.140,0:01:25.260
She was two and I made a mad neighbour to sleep with her

0:01:25.260,0:01:26.920
without the knowledge of her parents

0:01:26.920,0:01:32.300
for years.

0:01:32.300,0:01:35.540
What have you done to her marital life?

0:01:35.540,0:01:37.940
She is married to some Nigerian guy,

0:01:37.940,0:01:41.560
who is a soccer player.

0:01:41.560,0:01:45.240
I have frustrated his career.

0:01:45.240,0:01:47.780
He can't get a club in South Africa.

0:01:47.780,0:01:51.940
That thing!

0:01:51.940,0:01:53.900
I frustrated him.

0:01:53.900,0:01:55.780
He can't get a club.

0:01:55.780,0:01:58.060
He is not playing.

0:01:58.060,0:02:01.000
And everyone is making fun of him.

0:02:01.000,0:02:02.120
I am fine, wiseman.

0:02:02.120,0:02:02.900
Who is she to you?

0:02:02.900,0:02:06.720
She is my wife.

0:02:06.720,0:02:07.720
This one?

0:02:07.720,0:02:10.620
He is my driver.

0:02:10.620,0:02:11.360
He is what?

0:02:11.360,0:02:12.960
He is my driver.

0:02:12.960,0:02:14.180
He used to be my gardener,

0:02:14.180,0:02:17.800
I promoted him to be my driver.

0:02:17.800,0:02:19.660
He used to be your gardener?

0:02:19.660,0:02:21.760
My gardener, yes.

0:02:21.760,0:02:22.780
I promoted him.

0:02:22.780,0:02:23.280
To what?

0:02:23.280,0:02:24.960
To a driver.

0:02:24.960,0:02:26.320
You are my driver.

0:02:26.320,0:02:27.560
You are my wife.

0:02:27.560,0:02:28.440
You know you are my driver,

0:02:28.440,0:02:30.120
you take me everywhere I want to go.

0:02:30.120,0:02:31.940
You are my wife.

0:02:31.940,0:02:35.060
This guy takes me everywhere I want to go,

0:02:35.060,0:02:38.040
I go to functions, he takes me there.

0:02:38.040,0:02:40.740
If I want to go to work, he takes me there.

0:02:40.740,0:02:42.700
I don't want to drive,

0:02:42.700,0:02:44.120
I refused to drive.

0:02:44.120,0:02:48.160
I have my own car, but I use his car.

0:02:48.160,0:02:49.780
I will never drive.

0:02:49.780,0:02:51.320
Who drives you?

0:02:51.320,0:02:52.400
My driver.

0:02:52.400,0:02:54.960
He said, he is your husband?

0:02:54.960,0:03:00.260
This?

0:03:00.260,0:03:01.913
I am an educated woman,

0:03:01.920,0:03:05.840
how can I marry a soccer player?

0:03:05.840,0:03:08.800
You mean he is not your husband?

0:03:08.800,0:03:15.060
A driver?

0:03:15.060,0:03:17.360
What is this drama? Cameras?

0:03:17.360,0:03:21.080
I am the one who writes gossip about people.

0:03:21.080,0:03:22.460
What is this thing now?

0:03:22.460,0:03:23.840
What does she do for a living?

0:03:23.840,0:03:27.520
She was a journalist but she stopped.

0:03:27.520,0:03:30.680
She is now a communication manager in a company.

0:03:30.680,0:03:31.720
And you said as a journalist you

0:03:31.725,0:03:32.640
make her to embarrass people

0:03:32.640,0:03:33.400
that come here.

0:03:33.400,0:03:34.220
What are the things that you make her to do?

0:03:34.220,0:03:40.240
She was a gossip writer, she wrote 'Page three'.

0:03:40.240,0:03:41.160
A gossip writer?

0:03:41.160,0:03:41.660
Yes.

0:03:41.660,0:03:43.660
What do you mean by that?

0:03:43.660,0:03:45.200
How does she do it?

0:03:45.200,0:03:48.500
She writes about celebrities.

0:03:48.500,0:03:51.500
If she sees a celebrity with a woman,

0:03:51.500,0:03:55.060
she exposes that.

0:03:55.060,0:03:56.900
Marriages have been broken because

0:03:56.900,0:04:01.700
of the stories she writes.

0:04:01.700,0:04:03.680
Listen, you make her to break marriages

0:04:03.680,0:04:06.120
because of the stories you make her to write?

0:04:06.120,0:04:10.000
She has written horrible stories about people.

0:04:10.000,0:04:14.060
She would see a man with another woman and write a story.

0:04:14.060,0:04:16.040
She doesn't drink alcohol,

0:04:16.040,0:04:19.360
she would be the only sobber person in a function.

0:04:19.360,0:04:22.260
She would be looking at what people are doing,

0:04:22.260,0:04:27.020
the following day - the story would be all over the papers.

0:04:27.020,0:04:29.100
What do you have to say about it?

0:04:29.100,0:04:31.440
Actually, what she is saying, she is a journalist.

0:04:31.440,0:04:34.560
She is a well known journalist in South Africa.

0:04:34.560,0:04:36.780
Sometimes she is into the 'Page three'.

0:04:36.780,0:04:38.720
'Page three' means people that write

0:04:38.720,0:04:41.780
controversial stories about celebrities

0:04:41.780,0:04:45.820
or government officials.

0:04:45.820,0:04:48.240
What she does - she goes and brings it out

0:04:48.240,0:04:49.880
on the pages

0:04:49.880,0:04:52.480
so people will always know about that.

0:04:52.480,0:04:53.880
So what are the things you said you write about people

0:04:53.880,0:04:56.320
coming to the Synagogue?

0:04:56.320,0:05:04.160
There is another time, I saw the celebrity on Emmanuel TV.

0:05:04.160,0:05:10.180
He confessed that he was having an affair with three women.

0:05:10.180,0:05:17.780
I wrote about that story and he was very embarrassed.

0:05:17.780,0:05:23.560
People who watch Emmanuel TV critised me.

0:05:23.560,0:05:25.400
What is the essence of writing stories about the people

0:05:25.400,0:05:28.500
that come here, what do you want to achieve?

0:05:28.500,0:05:31.760
I wanted to make fun, it was a good story.

0:05:31.760,0:05:33.740
I want to be the best.

0:05:33.740,0:05:36.040
What have you done to him?

0:05:36.040,0:05:38.900
This one?

0:05:38.900,0:05:41.820
I frustrate him.

0:05:41.820,0:05:42.680
What do you mean,

0:05:42.680,0:05:45.420
what are the things you have done to him?

0:05:45.420,0:05:53.040
I make his wife not to respect him.

0:05:53.040,0:05:55.880
I scatter his money.

0:05:55.880,0:05:59.100
The little money he gets from being a soccer coach

0:05:59.100,0:06:03.840
at one of those schools there - I scatter it

0:06:03.840,0:06:08.780
just to embarrass him.

0:06:08.780,0:06:12.180
What else have you done?

0:06:12.180,0:06:18.760
He got a nice, cushy job with the police in South Africa.

0:06:18.760,0:06:21.080
Guess what?

0:06:21.080,0:06:23.660
He only earned three salaries.

0:06:23.660,0:06:26.140
What did I do?

0:06:26.140,0:06:29.320
What do you mean by that?

0:06:29.320,0:06:34.980
They just told him that the 
contract has been terminated.

0:06:34.980,0:06:37.740
There was a new commissioner

0:06:37.740,0:06:41.240
who did not what them anymore.

0:06:41.240,0:06:43.460
What have you done to his career as a footballer ?

0:06:43.460,0:06:44.300
Whose career?

0:06:44.300,0:06:47.240
This one?

0:06:47.240,0:06:50.720
He can't get a job, he can't get a club.

0:06:50.720,0:06:52.500
Why?

0:06:52.500,0:06:56.220
There was time, he wanted to play with a club.

0:06:56.220,0:07:00.340
You know what I did? I frustrated him.

0:07:00.340,0:07:01.640
He didn't get his clearance.

0:07:01.640,0:07:04.680
What can you say about her?

0:07:04.680,0:07:06.620
What she said about driving -

0:07:06.620,0:07:08.980
I paid for her to take the driving test

0:07:08.980,0:07:10.740
because before I wanted to come here ,

0:07:10.740,0:07:13.640
all my documents were stolen from my car.

0:07:13.640,0:07:15.620
Because I said to her that I wanted to come to The SCOAN,

0:07:15.620,0:07:16.740
and I wanted her to come too.

0:07:16.740,0:07:18.060
So my documents were all stolen.

0:07:18.060,0:07:22.040
What happened to his documents?

0:07:22.040,0:07:23.400
I stole them.

0:07:23.400,0:07:24.180
You stole them?

0:07:24.180,0:07:24.820
Yes.

0:07:24.820,0:07:27.680
Where did you take them to?

0:07:27.680,0:07:32.920
To some criminals.

0:07:32.920,0:07:33.960
Who made those people to come

0:07:33.960,0:07:35.720
and steal those documents?

0:07:35.720,0:07:38.160
I am the one.

0:07:38.160,0:07:40.140
What have you done to the marriage of this woman?

0:07:40.140,0:07:43.780
This guy can't enjoy his wife.

0:07:43.780,0:07:45.920
The wife hates kissing.

0:07:45.920,0:07:49.580
The wife hates sleeping with him.

0:07:49.580,0:07:53.160
The wife disrespects him.

0:07:53.160,0:07:56.760
The wife rules.

0:07:56.760,0:08:00.840
The wife earns more than him, she is the boss.

0:08:00.840,0:08:03.040
What can you say about that?

0:08:03.040,0:08:04.380
She is authoritative.

0:08:04.380,0:08:07.740
When I say her something, she will always argue before doing it.

0:08:07.740,0:08:10.080
She will always make sure she causes commotion.

0:08:10.080,0:08:14.020
And when she looks at you, she says she is just doing things because of...

0:08:14.020,0:08:15.540
What about the affection?

0:08:15.540,0:08:18.360
The affection - sometimes it's sour.

0:08:18.360,0:08:22.480
She tells me, she sees a spiritual husband in her dream,

0:08:22.480,0:08:28.760
after that dream, maybe for weeks, 
we will not make love.

0:08:28.760,0:08:31.600
Right now it is time to leave this body.

0:08:31.600,0:08:32.740
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:08:32.740,0:08:35.020
All over your body!

0:08:35.020,0:08:37.660
Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:08:37.660,0:08:40.420
Go!

0:08:40.420,0:08:42.620
In Jesus' name!

0:08:42.620,0:08:46.200
You are free, raise up!

0:08:46.200,0:08:53.260
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:08:53.260,0:08:59.200
Come!

0:08:59.200,0:09:00.360
How are you?

0:09:00.360,0:09:02.360
I'm fine, thank you, sir!

0:09:02.380,0:09:04.940
You said you are the spiritual husband.

0:09:04.940,0:09:07.520
No, he is my husband, sir.

0:09:07.520,0:09:08.540
He is your husband?

0:09:08.540,0:09:09.200
Yes, sir!

0:09:09.200,0:09:10.520
He is not your driver?

0:09:10.520,0:09:11.400
No.

0:09:11.400,0:09:12.000
Or your gardener?

0:09:12.000,0:09:13.100
No!

0:09:13.100,0:09:14.580
You said, he is your gardener and your driver.

0:09:14.580,0:09:16.540
No.

0:09:16.540,0:09:18.020
He is my husband.

0:09:18.020,0:09:20.260
He is the father of my children.

0:09:20.260,0:09:21.720
The confession that you heard is the

0:09:21.720,0:09:23.160
demon that was speaking through her,

0:09:23.160,0:09:24.040
right now that demon is out.

0:09:24.040,0:09:26.480
This is your true wife, okay?

0:09:26.480,0:09:29.060
Don't for any reason remind her of what happened here today

0:09:29.060,0:09:33.180
so that you also will not be tempted to do the same.

0:09:33.180,0:09:36.160
You are free.

0:09:36.160,0:09:41.720
Thank you, Jesus! We are free!

0:09:41.720,0:09:42.380
You listened to that?

0:09:42.380,0:09:44.560
There is something that the wisemen normally say

0:09:44.560,0:09:47.080
which I will remind you:

0:09:47.080,0:09:52.520
"Don't remind her no matter what happens in the house".

0:09:52.520,0:09:56.020
Whether the person is your wife, husband or friend

0:09:56.020,0:10:00.320
or even herself. That I have written about somebody -

0:10:00.320,0:10:05.380
that will constitute to attack.

0:10:05.380,0:10:07.900
When someone is delivered...

0:10:07.900,0:10:11.060
Viewers at home, if you watch Emmanuel TV

0:10:11.060,0:10:13.860
and you see your friend being delivered

0:10:13.860,0:10:17.340
and you are now using that in one way or another -

0:10:17.340,0:10:20.720
it's a great offense.

0:10:20.720,0:10:23.700
No matter what happens,

0:10:23.700,0:10:27.260
you can fight, you can abuse him or her differently -

0:10:27.260,0:10:32.180
not that thing he/she was delivered of.

0:10:32.180,0:10:35.900
If you dare mention that again...

0:10:35.900,0:10:37.200
Wow!

0:10:37.200,0:10:39.620
Unless you are delivered.

0:10:39.620,0:10:41.520
Because I don't know how you can get out of it,

0:10:41.520,0:10:45.680
unless you are delivered.

0:10:45.680,0:10:47.300
God is saying someone is free,

0:10:47.300,0:10:49.720
and you are now saying someone is not free.

0:10:49.720,0:10:52.440
Can you see, you are standing against God?

0:10:52.440,0:10:55.320
If am talking to you, let me see your hand.

0:10:55.320,0:10:57.700
It is God that has freed her.

0:10:57.700,0:10:58.900
When God says you are free,

0:10:58.900,0:11:01.300
someone is standing to say: "No!"

0:11:01.300,0:11:03.900
A man confesses that he has an evil spirit

0:11:03.900,0:11:06.260
and I say: "You are free in Jesus' name!" -

0:11:06.260,0:11:08.800
and the person is free immediately.

0:11:08.800,0:11:10.420
Now someone somewhere,

0:11:10.420,0:11:14.260
maybe in one way or the other they were fighting

0:11:14.260,0:11:17.280
and he says: "Ah, evil spirit."

0:11:17.280,0:11:21.520
You are telling God that the person is not delivered.

0:11:21.520,0:11:23.200
God says that the person is delivered and

0:11:23.200,0:11:25.400
you are saying that the person is not delivered.

0:11:25.400,0:11:27.360
And when you fight against God -

0:11:27.360,0:11:30.100
my God, you are finished!

0:11:30.100,0:11:33.260
So when the wiseman says:

0:11:33.260,0:11:37.340
"Don't ever repeat what you hear now,

0:11:37.340,0:11:40.200
no matter what happens in future."

0:11:40.200,0:11:42.740
Whether you people are fighting, or disagreement.

0:11:42.740,0:11:44.500
Whether you know the person somewhere

0:11:44.500,0:11:46.920
and you heard the confession they made.

0:11:46.920,0:11:50.440
And you are now using that 
confession against the person.

0:11:50.440,0:11:52.880
God set the person free of that guilt -

0:11:52.880,0:11:55.260
and you are now saying: "No! He is not free."

0:11:55.260,0:11:59.420
It is the greatest offence.

0:11:59.420,0:12:01.980
Whether you are an apostle, or bishop

0:12:01.980,0:12:03.940
or prophet, or whatever name you call yourself -

0:12:03.960,0:12:08.760
I know that no anointed man would say such a thing,

0:12:08.760,0:12:11.540
because they know the position of God.

0:12:11.540,0:12:13.820
So this is a warning to the whole world.

0:12:13.820,0:12:16.040
Those who will continue to do it -

0:12:16.040,0:12:20.220
you will continue to see many of them

0:12:20.220,0:12:22.220
and I wish you good luck.

0:12:22.220,0:12:25.300
When you see somebody like this sister now, rejoice with her.

0:12:25.300,0:12:33.000
Because you too, you need deliverance.

0:12:33.060,0:12:34.800
Let's listen.

0:12:34.800,0:12:52.800
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:52.880,0:12:56.560
Praise the Lord!

0:12:56.560,0:12:58.280
Emmanuel!

0:12:58.280,0:13:01.300
My name is Nonyese John.

0:13:01.300,0:13:05.320
The man standing next to me is Namdi John.

0:13:05.320,0:13:07.560
I am a South African and he is a Nigerian.

0:13:07.560,0:13:10.500
We live in Johannesburg.

0:13:10.500,0:13:13.260
I am a journalist by profession

0:13:13.260,0:13:16.760
and he is a soccer player by profession.

0:13:16.760,0:13:20.960
The problem that brought us here was sickness.

0:13:20.960,0:13:25.640
I had a mild stroke and a spiritual husband.

0:13:25.640,0:13:31.600
When we came here, I wanted to be on the prayer line.

0:13:31.600,0:13:34.220
As a jounalist, you people are very out spoken.

0:13:34.220,0:13:36.120
I want you to be free and talk.

0:13:36.120,0:13:36.920
Before they touched you,

0:13:36.920,0:13:39.300
what was going through your mind?

0:13:39.300,0:13:41.060
Did you actually believe that what happened to you -

0:13:41.060,0:13:41.880
will happen to you?

0:13:41.880,0:13:43.740
Say everything, feel free.

0:13:43.740,0:13:46.340
Educate the whole world, as a journalist.

0:13:46.340,0:13:48.580
Because I have been prayed for before.

0:13:48.580,0:13:50.820
I have been prayed  with powerful men of God before

0:13:50.820,0:13:53.020
breathing the same air with them.

0:13:53.020,0:13:58.320
I have been to Bible school just for fun anyway.

0:13:58.320,0:13:59.780
I have been with men of God before,

0:13:59.780,0:14:01.380
they have laid hands on me.

0:14:01.380,0:14:03.240
Nothing has ever happened to me like

0:14:03.240,0:14:05.300
what happened on that day.

0:14:05.300,0:14:08.580
In some instances, when the man of God is praying for me,

0:14:08.580,0:14:09.680
when people are falling -

0:14:09.680,0:14:12.440
I just fall because I feel sorry for him

0:14:12.440,0:14:14.740
because I didn't want him to be embarrassed.

0:14:14.740,0:14:19.440
Journalist, because they are the police of the world,

0:14:19.440,0:14:22.640
they will tell you what they feel.

0:14:22.640,0:14:26.600
She is telling us now that she has been to many places,

0:14:26.600,0:14:28.580
where she saw many people falling, she also fell

0:14:28.580,0:14:33.760
because she felt sorry for the man of God.

0:14:33.760,0:14:36.260
Because I didn't want the man of God to be embarrassed,

0:14:36.260,0:14:38.740
I just fell.

0:14:38.740,0:14:44.360
When wiseman Daniel came, I was very angry.

0:14:44.360,0:14:49.120
As I said, something else upset me, so I was just chilling.

0:14:49.120,0:14:50.960
As I was looking as the wiseman,

0:14:50.960,0:14:53.360
I was thinking: "He needs makeover".

0:14:53.360,0:14:55.400
I looked at his hair and stuff like that,

0:14:55.400,0:14:58.880
I even told my husband that the wiseman needs makeover.

0:14:58.880,0:15:03.060
My husband told me to concentrate on what we are here for

0:15:03.060,0:15:08.480
and stop talking about people.

0:15:08.480,0:15:10.540
When the wiseman touched me,

0:15:10.540,0:15:13.580
it was like I had been hit by something.

0:15:13.580,0:15:15.680
I've never had that experience before

0:15:15.680,0:15:17.040
in my life.

0:15:17.040,0:15:23.280
I went mad; the spirit in me went crazy,

0:15:23.280,0:15:25.420
I just wanted to run away,

0:15:25.420,0:15:27.460
I was so angry and uncomfortable.

0:15:27.460,0:15:30.740
I told him that I want to go back to South Africa.

0:15:30.740,0:15:35.580
As a celebrity journalist writing "Page three" and gossip,

0:15:35.580,0:15:42.920
I wrote about celebrities, politicians, men of God -

0:15:42.920,0:15:46.460
everyone who is in the lime light.

0:15:46.460,0:15:50.900
If they do something wrong, I will write about it.

0:15:50.900,0:15:55.000
If they cheat on their wives, I will write about it.

0:15:55.000,0:15:58.780
If they don't pay maintenance, I would write about that.

0:15:58.780,0:16:02.080
If they get drunk, I would  write about that.

0:16:02.080,0:16:06.840
If they cheat, I would write about that.

0:16:06.840,0:16:11.660
I was one of the best "Page three" writers in South Africa.

0:16:11.660,0:16:15.340
People hated me, celebrities hated me,

0:16:15.340,0:16:20.340
I have been beaten up, followed around and threatened.

0:16:20.340,0:16:29.020
In September, I saw a South African 
celebrity on Emmanuel TV.

0:16:29.020,0:16:30.980
The man of God prophesied that there

0:16:30.980,0:16:33.300
was a man in the congregation,

0:16:33.300,0:16:38.540
who had three girlfriends and was married

0:16:38.540,0:16:41.240
and the man was there.

0:16:41.240,0:16:44.440
I was shocked to see someone that I knew,

0:16:44.440,0:16:47.520
that I had written about before,

0:16:47.520,0:16:49.980
who is a well known business man and

0:16:49.980,0:16:53.300
a respected celebrity in South Africa.

0:16:53.300,0:16:55.300
I wrote that story.

0:16:55.300,0:17:00.080
I was told by the editors to call the man of God,

0:17:00.080,0:17:04.180
because if we mentioned anyone in the newspapers

0:17:04.180,0:17:08.000
in your story you have to get their comment.

0:17:08.000,0:17:13.780
I knew that it could have been silly to ask for a comment

0:17:13.780,0:17:15.380
like that from the man of God.

0:17:15.380,0:17:17.520
I went back to the editor and lied,

0:17:17.520,0:17:20.060
that I couldn't get the man of God.

0:17:20.060,0:17:22.920
But we carried on with the story anyway.

0:17:22.920,0:17:27.520
It was published on "Page three"

0:17:27.520,0:17:30.680
of the newspaper I used to work for.

0:17:30.680,0:17:33.000
Don't worry about the story. We thank God!

0:17:33.000,0:17:35.900
How are you feeling after your deliverance?

0:17:35.900,0:17:39.740
After my deliverance I went back to the internet,

0:17:39.740,0:17:42.180
I read the story that I had written -

0:17:42.180,0:17:44.540
I was so ashamed of myself.

0:17:44.540,0:17:49.980
I couldn't believe I could write some of the things I had wrote.

0:17:49.980,0:17:54.080
Can you tell us, when the wiseman laid the hand on you -

0:17:54.080,0:17:56.320
what actually happened to you?

0:17:56.320,0:17:58.240
The spirit inside of me was very angry.

0:17:58.800,0:18:01.160
I couldn't believe what was happening

0:18:01.160,0:18:03.780
and there were cameras all over the place

0:18:03.780,0:18:08.340
and there was a lady taking pictures of me.

0:18:08.340,0:18:10.800
I just went mad.

0:18:10.800,0:18:13.360
Ok, now as a journalist, what message

0:18:13.360,0:18:16.300
do you have to your colleagues all over the world?

0:18:16.300,0:18:19.020
Because it is always difficult for you to believe

0:18:19.020,0:18:20.400
and now you have seen -

0:18:20.400,0:18:23.460
what message do you have for them?

0:18:23.460,0:18:26.540
The message I have especially for my colleagues

0:18:26.540,0:18:28.000
journalists.

0:18:28.000,0:18:29.920
I had written some of the stories

0:18:29.920,0:18:34.540
that had been written about The SCOAN.

0:18:34.540,0:18:38.560
People must come here and experience for themselves.

0:18:38.560,0:18:41.440
They must not write hearsay.

0:18:41.440,0:18:45.420
This is a place of God;

0:18:45.420,0:18:46.560
God resides here.

0:18:46.560,0:18:48.960
I mean as I had said before, I have breathed

0:18:48.960,0:18:52.480
the same air with very powerful men of God.

0:18:52.480,0:18:54.700
I have gone to Bible school,

0:18:54.700,0:18:56.800
I have been with respected men of God.

0:18:56.800,0:19:00.340
But I have never experienced in my life

0:19:00.340,0:19:05.960
what I experienced that day.

0:19:05.960,0:19:11.520
Now, after you deliverance and after you went to lodge to sleep,

0:19:11.520,0:19:13.420
tell us your experience now.

0:19:13.420,0:19:15.580
How do you know you are free?

0:19:15.580,0:19:17.060
Compare the experience you are having now

0:19:17.060,0:19:22.580
and the experience you had in the past.

0:19:22.580,0:19:24.720
Since I was two, I have had

0:19:24.720,0:19:26.880
problem with a spiritual husband.

0:19:26.880,0:19:28.580
It would come in different forms;

0:19:28.580,0:19:30.380
I would be pressed at night.

0:19:30.380,0:19:32.760
I would be forced to sleep with my stomach

0:19:32.760,0:19:34.460
because I was scared that

0:19:34.460,0:19:38.060
that thing would press me until I die.

0:19:38.060,0:19:40.880
For the first time in my life I slept

0:19:40.880,0:19:43.400
peacefully with no problem.

0:19:43.400,0:19:46.200
Sometimes I would be prayed for, and I hoped

0:19:46.200,0:19:49.160
that the spiritual husband won't come back again.

0:19:49.160,0:19:51.220
But it comes back.

0:19:51.220,0:19:55.280
It has been for days I haven't experienced any problems.

0:19:55.280,0:19:57.600
I slept like a baby.

0:19:57.600,0:20:00.340
Hallelujah! You listen to that?

0:20:00.340,0:20:01.980
Your love towards your husband -

0:20:01.980,0:20:03.420
what about the affection?

0:20:03.420,0:20:07.340
Before then, I treated my husband like a friend,

0:20:07.340,0:20:10.960
like he was like one of the people - a brother.

0:20:10.960,0:20:14.880
But now we are more like husband and wife.

0:20:14.880,0:20:20.960
I love him more and everything is fine now.

0:20:20.960,0:20:23.540
OK, let's hear from my brother.

0:20:23.540,0:20:25.420
So how are you, my brother?

0:20:25.420,0:20:26.760
I am fine, daddy.

0:20:26.760,0:20:29.540
Now, that your wife has been delivered -

0:20:29.540,0:20:32.660
can you just give us in two minutes, before and after

0:20:32.660,0:20:34.120
- the affection?

0:20:34.120,0:20:36.460
Emmanuel!

0:20:36.460,0:20:41.620
Previously, I was staying with a man and a friend.

0:20:41.620,0:20:46.260
Sometimes, one or two experiences at home -

0:20:46.260,0:20:51.840
it was like two partners that are trying to compete

0:20:51.840,0:20:54.520
or to prove a point in the house.

0:20:54.520,0:20:58.180
But I believe after this deliverance

0:20:58.180,0:21:00.160
I have experienced a lot of differences.

0:21:00.160,0:21:04.480
I am so blessed and I am very 
happy with this ministry.

0:21:04.480,0:21:08.920
Have you now recovered you wife
 from the hands of the evil spirit?

0:21:08.920,0:21:09.680
Completely?

0:21:09.680,0:21:10.880
Totally!

0:21:10.880,0:21:14.140
Thank you! This is what we want to hear.

0:21:14.140,0:21:17.280
I hope you understood my question.

0:21:17.280,0:21:22.060
Because the person he married at the beginning -

0:21:22.060,0:21:24.860
there are many things he saw in the lady,

0:21:24.860,0:21:27.260
when he got married to her.

0:21:27.260,0:21:29.080
Now he has discovered those things,

0:21:29.080,0:21:32.160
those things were lost for sometime.

0:21:32.160,0:21:33.940
He has discovered those things.

0:21:33.940,0:21:36.100
Thank you very much!

0:21:36.100,0:21:40.400
Hallelujah!
