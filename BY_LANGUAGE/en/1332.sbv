0:00:00.000,0:00:02.980
Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the man of God,

0:00:02.980,0:00:07.760
Prophet T.B. Joshua conducts the mass prayer in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,

0:00:07.760,0:00:11.400
exposing every demon that was hiding under the shades of darkness,

0:00:11.400,0:00:16.520
causing the oppressed to vomit up all the poisonous substances planted by the devil

0:00:16.520,0:00:20.140
and breaking every chain of bondage, setting the people free.

0:00:20.140,0:00:23.020
See the evil spirit inside this lady cry out.

0:00:23.020,0:00:25.220
Let us hear what it has to say.

0:00:25.220,0:00:27.120
I am her husband.

0:00:27.120,0:00:28.460
What did you make her do?

0:00:28.460,0:00:31.820
Prostitution.

0:00:31.820,0:00:33.160
We are three.

0:00:33.160,0:00:35.100
Who is number 2?

0:00:35.100,0:00:36.280
Dragon.

0:00:36.280,0:00:37.620
Number 3?

TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:00:49.160,0:00:52.080
My name is Emmanuella Amana.

0:00:52.080,0:00:56.820
I'm from Adamawa State, the Northern part of Nigeria.

0:00:56.820,0:01:04.860
The woman standing beside me is my lovely mother, Mary.

0:01:04.860,0:01:11.960
First of all, I want to thank God for my deliverance last week Sunday.

0:01:11.960,0:01:16.700
I was two years old when I lost my father.

0:01:16.700,0:01:20.640
My mum remarried when I was 10 years old.

0:01:20.640,0:01:27.960
The man she married was a retired soldier who had children in Lagos.

0:01:27.960,0:01:32.380
The children used to travel to the North to visit their father.

0:01:32.380,0:01:35.620
They saw how their father treated me and didn't like it.

0:01:35.620,0:01:39.800
So, they told me to follow them to Lagos.

0:01:39.800,0:01:43.640
I followed them to Lagos, hoping that they would put me in school

0:01:43.640,0:01:54.060
so I could continue my studies there, not knowing that it was prostitution they wanted me to do in Lagos.

0:01:54.060,0:01:59.480
The lady I was staying with was married to a soldier.

0:01:59.480,0:02:03.620
She had a shop in the canteen, a beer parlour.

0:02:03.620,0:02:11.020
I was 13 years old then; she started giving me to men.

0:02:11.020,0:02:12.940
By then, I didn't use to drink.

0:02:12.940,0:02:18.200
She would force me to drink and told me I would get used to it with time.

0:02:18.200,0:02:28.420
I started with half a bottle and later on proceeded to drinking five or six bottles a day.

0:02:28.420,0:02:31.420
In a day, I would sleep with two or three men.

0:02:31.420,0:02:34.500
If I refused, she would send me out of her house

0:02:34.500,0:02:37.480
and I would beg the neighbours before I could sleep.

0:02:37.480,0:02:41.880
You were at the age of 13 when you were sold into prostitution.

0:02:41.880,0:02:44.220
Yes.

0:02:44.220,0:02:49.780
That was how things went until I was 14 years old

0:02:49.780,0:02:54.560
when I got pregnant by one of the men who was sleeping with me.

0:02:54.560,0:02:57.920
She sent me out of her house and told me I should go for an abortion.

0:02:57.920,0:03:04.020
I told her that I was scared, that I had never done that in my life.

0:03:04.020,0:03:05.960
She sent me out of her house.

0:03:05.960,0:03:10.560
I went to the guy I was dating before the pregnancy.

0:03:10.560,0:03:18.560
I told him what had happened and he claimed responsibility for the pregnancy

0:03:18.560,0:03:20.940
and said I should stay with him.

0:03:20.940,0:03:27.160
I started living with him until I gave birth to my first daughter.

0:03:27.160,0:03:33.080
I started going out, drinking, going out with men.

0:03:33.080,0:03:39.740
Sometimes, I would leave my baby at home with my neighbours and go to clubs with my sisters.

0:03:39.740,0:03:41.660
I would follow them to clubs.

0:03:41.660,0:03:43.340
We would drink; they would give me to men.

0:03:43.340,0:03:46.180
That was how things continued.

0:03:46.180,0:03:51.480
I took my daughter and left her father because every time, he would beat me.

0:03:51.480,0:03:57.020
I took my daughter to my mum's place in Adamawa State.

0:03:57.020,0:04:02.860
I returned to Lagos and stayed with my sisters again.

0:04:02.860,0:04:07.440
So you went and abandoned your baby with your mum in Adamawa

0:04:07.440,0:04:10.760
and returned back to Lagos to continue that same lifestyle.

0:04:10.760,0:04:12.760
Yes.

0:04:12.760,0:04:20.540
I continued sleeping with men every day - sometimes five or six a day.

0:04:20.540,0:04:27.940
I started dating a soldier - a married man.

0:04:27.940,0:04:33.040
I got pregnant fives times by him and aborted them.

0:04:33.040,0:04:42.260
The sixth one - he told me that he would see small babies in his dream, crying

0:04:42.260,0:04:46.080
and by then, I was pregnant for the sixth time.

0:04:46.080,0:04:48.820
He said I should not abort that one.

0:04:48.820,0:04:54.060
I started staying with him but he was married with four children.

0:04:54.060,0:05:02.720
His workplace posted him to Badagry and we started living together as husband and wife.

0:05:02.720,0:05:08.360
I continued drinking and I would disgrace myself.

0:05:08.360,0:05:11.940
People would question what kind of woman I was.

0:05:11.940,0:05:23.900
When I first started going to the bar, everybody loved me but with my level of drinking,

0:05:23.900,0:05:27.320
people began to hate me.

0:05:27.320,0:05:29.380
Sorry, just give us an example, sister.

0:05:29.380,0:05:33.420
How severe was this drunkenness you are talking about?

0:05:33.420,0:05:37.260
Give us an example - on a daily basis, how much were you taking?

0:05:37.260,0:05:42.560
I would drink one or two crates of beer a day.

0:05:42.560,0:05:47.280
Miss Emmanuella Amana & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:05:47.280,0:05:52.260
I would drink for a week without eating.

0:05:52.260,0:05:56.460
I lost appetite and never used to eat.

0:05:56.460,0:05:59.320
I would cook food but not eat it.

0:05:59.320,0:06:05.440
The soldier said the disgrace was too much and sent me out of his house with my second baby

0:06:05.440,0:06:07.420
and by then, I was pregnant.

0:06:07.420,0:06:13.420
I then went back to the North where I gave birth to my third born - a boy.

0:06:13.420,0:06:15.140
I have two girls and one boy.

0:06:15.140,0:06:17.600
I left the children with my mum.

0:06:17.600,0:06:22.440
My sister called me to come back to Lagos.

0:06:22.440,0:06:25.760
That was how I found myself back in Lagos.

0:06:25.760,0:06:32.300
That time was worse than before

0:06:32.300,0:06:37.080
because I would spend time in the hotels, sleeping with men.

0:06:37.080,0:06:44.720
We were just prostitutes because in the hotel, any girl you would see there was a prostitute.

0:06:44.720,0:06:47.960
So that's how I kept on drinking.

0:06:47.960,0:06:55.240
I became addicted to alcohol and could not do without it for a minute.

0:06:55.240,0:06:56.840
I would start drinking from the morning.

0:06:56.840,0:07:01.640
I stopped drinking beer and started on gin.

0:07:01.640,0:07:12.640
I would finish four or five big bottles a day.

0:07:12.640,0:07:14.920
That's how the thing kept on going.

0:07:14.920,0:07:20.060
Miss Emmanuella Amana & Mother
Deliverance Testimony

0:07:20.060,0:07:22.440
So we can understand what our sister is talking about.

0:07:22.440,0:07:28.100
From the age of thirteen, she was forcefully introduced to alcohol and prostitution

0:07:28.100,0:07:30.480
and that set the trend for the rest of her life,

0:07:30.480,0:07:33.700
leading to the point that at a very tender age, she had three children

0:07:33.700,0:07:35.700
and was not staying with their fathers.

0:07:35.700,0:07:40.820
At this point, sister, were you going anywhere, maybe in search of a solution

0:07:40.820,0:07:46.640
or to try and acquire powers to be able to continue this kind of prostitution job

0:07:46.640,0:07:51.540
or to get money - just explain what kind of places you went to.

0:07:51.540,0:08:00.060
I would sleep with men and get money but could not use the money for anything.

0:08:00.060,0:08:03.140
I would use it to drink.

0:08:03.140,0:08:08.600
I could not even take care of myself or send money to my mum.

0:08:08.600,0:08:13.620
I started going to churches for deliverance. That did not work.

0:08:13.620,0:08:17.880
My problem would rather intensify.

0:08:17.880,0:08:24.440
I started to follow my sister to a native doctor's house.

0:08:24.440,0:08:33.060
I wanted to make money believing that maybe it would take away the drinking and other problems.

0:08:33.060,0:08:39.220
That was why I started going to native doctors' houses with my sister.

0:08:39.220,0:08:54.720
My sister told me about a place in Kebbi State, Nigeria where they used to serve a god -

0:08:54.720,0:09:00.900
a crocodile of about 500 years old.

0:09:00.900,0:09:07.560
I found myself there because I needed money.

0:09:07.560,0:09:10.420
I went there.

0:09:10.420,0:09:13.660
I didn't even know anybody there but I started asking questions

0:09:13.660,0:09:17.960
until I found someone who could direct me to the place.

0:09:17.960,0:09:25.900
I got there and met the men there who were a hundred years old

0:09:25.900,0:09:29.940
and could not even walk on their own.

0:09:29.940,0:09:37.740
They asked me what my problem was and I told them that I needed money.

0:09:37.740,0:09:43.520
They told me to buy a fowl and some other things; they then took me to their shrine.

0:09:43.520,0:09:50.940
Before getting to their shrine, they told me to take off my shoes, shirt and bra.

0:09:50.940,0:09:56.480
The only thing that they left me with was my trousers.

0:09:56.480,0:10:01.440
I then entered the shrine.

0:10:01.440,0:10:06.360
Some people were there before me.

0:10:06.360,0:10:08.520
So, the man I followed there,

0:10:08.520,0:10:16.080
the one who was serving the crocodile said I should sit and wait.

0:10:16.080,0:10:23.780
When I entered the shrine, I saw one big crocodile with its mouth wide open.

0:10:23.780,0:10:29.420
I thought it was dead but then I saw the eyes of the crocodile move.

0:10:29.420,0:10:33.100
I saw that it was alive but I was not afraid.

0:10:33.100,0:10:38.220
I sat, folded my arms and covered my breasts.

0:10:38.220,0:10:42.020
The old man then told me to remove my hands and be free.

0:10:42.020,0:10:45.900
I agreed since I believed I would get money.

0:10:45.900,0:10:47.480
That was how I was sitting.

0:10:47.480,0:10:53.600
Within about three seconds, it was like, I was blind but then able to see -

0:10:53.600,0:10:57.280
everywhere in that forest were crocodiles.

0:10:57.280,0:11:00.000
I saw more than 100 crocodiles there.

0:11:00.000,0:11:02.760
There was a river surrounding the shrine.

0:11:02.760,0:11:05.700
Crocodiles were coming out of the river,

0:11:05.700,0:11:08.840
while some were going in, even some were passing my legs.

0:11:08.840,0:11:12.540
The man asked me if I was afraid and I told him that I wasn't.

0:11:12.540,0:11:16.320
After they finished with the lady before me, they called me.

0:11:16.320,0:11:18.560
I went to the crocodile.

0:11:18.560,0:11:21.520
I was asked my name and I told the man.

0:11:21.520,0:11:25.740
The man spoke a certain dialect with the crocodile which I didn't understand.

0:11:25.740,0:11:28.600
He would say, "This is what the master said..." - that what did I want.

0:11:28.600,0:11:31.140
I then told him that I wanted money.

0:11:31.140,0:11:33.100
He said, "Okay, no problem".

0:11:33.100,0:11:39.480
He asked me if I had the money, what I would bring him in return.

0:11:39.480,0:11:42.380
I told him that I would bring a goat.

0:11:42.380,0:11:44.540
He collected the fowl from me,

0:11:44.540,0:11:53.880
used his hand to cut the fowl's head and threw it into the river.

0:11:53.880,0:12:02.180
The fowl did not even touch the water before I saw big crocodiles, like 10 of me,

0:12:02.180,0:12:11.800
just like a cow, come up from the water, grab the fowl and go back into the water.

0:12:11.800,0:12:17.700
I thought I was dreaming and asked myself if they were crocodiles, cows or something else.

0:12:17.700,0:12:28.440
The man then went to the river, took a calabash and used it to fetch water and gave me to drink.

0:12:28.440,0:12:32.180
The remaining water, he said I should use it to bathe, which I did.

0:12:32.180,0:12:33.780
I left there.

0:12:33.780,0:12:37.780
When I saw my sister, I told her what I had done.

0:12:37.780,0:12:46.020
One, two weeks passed and I didn't see any money.

0:12:46.020,0:12:48.940
Things became worse.

0:12:48.940,0:12:59.840
I began to see crocodiles, pythons, dragons and different kinds of animals in my dreams.

0:12:59.840,0:13:03.320
That was how I started seeking for solution...

0:13:03.320,0:13:08.360
So after your encounter at this shrine where they worship crocodiles,

0:13:08.360,0:13:12.740
it was immediately after then, you began to see crocodiles in your dreams.

0:13:12.740,0:13:14.920
And what you went there for never materialised.

0:13:14.920,0:13:16.920
You never saw the money you went there for.

0:13:16.920,0:13:19.160
Yes.

0:13:19.160,0:13:25.840
I decided that since they didn't want to give me money, I would continue with what I was doing.

0:13:25.840,0:13:28.100
My sister agreed with me.

0:13:28.100,0:13:29.700
That was how we kept on going.

0:13:29.700,0:13:37.900
Things became much worse; I would drink and disgrace myself.

0:13:37.900,0:13:44.660
The people on my street would laugh at me and call me different names, like drunkard.

0:13:44.660,0:13:52.020
Even my sister who taught me how to drink started calling me names.

0:13:52.020,0:13:55.200
I started fasting and praying.

0:13:55.200,0:13:59.300
My mum didn't even know anything about what I was doing.

0:13:59.300,0:14:06.460
Whenever she asked me, I would lie to her that I was working and boast I was this and that.

0:14:06.460,0:14:10.800
So at this point, sister, how did you come to be at The SCOAN

0:14:10.800,0:14:14.360
as we saw you receive your deliverance last week?

0:14:14.360,0:14:25.580
Last week, on Friday before coming to the church on Sunday, I went to a club with my sisters.

0:14:25.580,0:14:31.780
I got drunk, came back home and decided to sleep.

0:14:31.780,0:14:37.320
When I went to sleep, I heard a voice saying, "The SCOAN".

0:14:37.320,0:14:43.580
I thought, "What business do I have with T.B. Joshua's church?"

0:14:43.580,0:14:45.420
I went back to sleep.

0:14:45.420,0:14:49.780
The voice kept on talking as if I was seeing the person.

0:14:49.780,0:14:55.020
The voice came with more power and became louder,

0:14:55.020,0:14:59.660
telling me to stand up and come to The SCOAN.

0:14:59.660,0:15:04.540
That was how I found myself here.

0:15:04.540,0:15:09.860
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:15:09.860,0:15:14.260
Last week during the mass prayer section, we saw on the clips earlier

0:15:14.260,0:15:18.180
how that evil spirit, the spirit of crocodile, dragon and spiritual husband

0:15:18.180,0:15:22.020
that had pushed you into such an atrocious lifestyle was exposed.

0:15:22.020,0:15:23.500
Tell us your own experience.

0:15:23.500,0:15:26.900
When the prayer was going on, what happened to you at that moment?

0:15:26.900,0:15:31.300
All that I can remember is that I was sitting at the back -

0:15:31.300,0:15:35.460
I don't know what happened; something just moved me.

0:15:35.460,0:15:39.640
I just found myself at the front.

0:15:39.640,0:15:42.540
That's all I can remember.

0:15:42.540,0:15:46.440
Ok, sister. Now to the glory of God, ever since your deliverance,

0:15:46.440,0:15:55.640
what can you say about your lifestyle and the changes you have witnessed in this short period?

0:15:55.640,0:15:58.320
After my deliverance...

0:15:58.320,0:16:02.520
I didn't even use to sleep because of the nightmares.

0:16:02.520,0:16:05.920
I would see different kind of things - scorpions, pythons.

0:16:05.920,0:16:09.080
I would even be in the midst of them - only me as a human being.

0:16:09.080,0:16:15.060
But after my deliverance, I sleep like a baby.

0:16:15.060,0:16:24.260
This urge of drinking, when I am going to church or going out to eat and I see people drinking,

0:16:24.260,0:16:28.660
I feel like stopping and preaching to them.

0:16:28.660,0:16:35.380
Miss Emmanuella Amana
Deliverance Testimony

0:16:35.380,0:16:39.000
I feel light.

0:16:39.000,0:16:43.060
Before, there was something in me.

0:16:43.060,0:16:48.040
I was heavy before but now, I feel light.

0:16:48.040,0:16:53.360
Since my deliverance, no men have called me on my phone.

0:16:53.360,0:16:58.560
Even the Saturday before coming to church, people invited me to go clubbing.

0:16:58.560,0:17:03.000
My sister called when I was in church before my deliverance, asking where I was.

0:17:03.000,0:17:04.780
I told her that I was in church.

0:17:04.780,0:17:14.920
She criticised me and said that I was missing out.

0:17:14.920,0:17:19.120
She told me some important people had come from Abuja who wished to see me.

0:17:19.120,0:17:22.100
I told her that they should not disturb me, that I was in church.

0:17:22.100,0:17:26.420
No man has called my phone since my deliverance.

0:17:26.420,0:17:31.280
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:17:31.280,0:17:35.720
You mean to say, sister, that for the first time in more than eleven years

0:17:35.720,0:17:38.620
that you have been addicted to alcohol, since the tender age of 13,

0:17:38.620,0:17:41.620
this week, you have not taken any alcohol.

0:17:41.620,0:17:43.120
Never.

0:17:43.120,0:17:44.440
I have not.

0:17:44.440,0:17:48.140
I don't even have the urge to take it.

0:17:48.140,0:17:50.180
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:17:50.180,0:17:53.680
You said that even just the week before you came,

0:17:53.680,0:17:55.520
you were still into this lifestyle of prostitution.

0:17:55.520,0:17:58.980
You mean that since your deliverance, you have stopped that life. You are no longer...

0:17:58.980,0:18:00.260
Yes.

0:18:00.260,0:18:02.460
Wow. We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:18:02.460,0:18:05.960
One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:18:05.960,0:18:10.480
Truly, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

0:18:10.480,0:18:14.140
Sister, at a young age, you have seen so much in life.

0:18:14.140,0:18:18.580
You have seen the very reality of this kind of lifestyle you were living before -

0:18:18.580,0:18:24.440
a lifestyle surrounded by drunkenness, lust, clubbing, every evil imaginable.

0:18:24.440,0:18:26.980
Now that you are here as a living testimony,

0:18:26.980,0:18:29.400
what do you want to advise our viewers all over the world,

0:18:29.400,0:18:34.720
especially those that are still living that kind of life you were once living?

0:18:34.720,0:18:46.300
My advice to the viewers all over the world, especially to those who are doing what I did,

0:18:46.300,0:18:53.120
run to God because life without Christ is not life.

0:18:53.120,0:18:59.460
It is now I know I am living a life because I can read my Bible, pray

0:18:59.460,0:19:02.120
and even preach to people now.

0:19:02.120,0:19:04.680
I don't even know how it started coming.

0:19:04.680,0:19:07.260
They should please come to God.

0:19:07.260,0:19:12.760
Clubbing, drinking, womanising and all that, is not going to solve the problem.

0:19:12.760,0:19:15.060
It will just be adding more to your problem.

0:19:15.060,0:19:16.680
It will destroy your life.

0:19:16.680,0:19:20.840
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:19:20.840,0:19:24.880
We have heard it all from our sister. We just want to hear a final word from her mother.

0:19:24.880,0:19:28.840
My name is Mrs Mary. I am living in Adamawa.

0:19:28.840,0:19:36.280
I came to Lagos to see what my daugther was doing here.

0:19:36.280,0:19:39.960
Since she left the house, I hadn't seen her.

0:19:39.960,0:19:45.040
She left me with small children and I suffered with them.

0:19:45.040,0:19:53.460
I'm selling leaves, firewood, everything to take care of the small children

0:19:53.460,0:19:55.820
that she left with me.

0:19:55.820,0:20:03.360
The man of God called me and asked if I could come and see the miracle of Jesus,

0:20:03.360,0:20:07.140
what God had done for my daughter at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria.

0:20:07.140,0:20:16.760
That is why I travelled from Adamawa to Lagos to see what God has done for my daughter.

0:20:16.760,0:20:22.360
Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord! Thank you, Man of God!

0:20:22.360,0:20:26.840
Thank you, T.B. Joshua, for my daughter.

0:20:26.840,0:20:32.660
Man of God, now she is healed!

0:20:32.660,0:20:36.200
Nothing will touch her, in Jesus' name!

0:20:36.200,0:20:40.640
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:40.640,0:20:44.540
Our mother travelled a long distance, far from the North of Nigeria,

0:20:44.540,0:20:48.180
from Adamawa State, just to witness this wonderful testimony.

0:20:48.180,0:20:51.680
And we can imagine: She had to take care of these three young children

0:20:51.680,0:20:54.700
bearing all of the burdens and we thank God today,

0:20:54.700,0:20:58.840
Jesus Christ has finally come into this matter and set her daughter free.

0:20:58.840,0:21:00.160
We thank God for this deliverance, sister.

0:21:00.160,0:21:04.300
We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain the wonderful deliverance you have received

0:21:04.300,0:21:06.400
and make the Word of God the standard for your life

0:21:06.400,0:21:08.720
and we know that as you receive from Jesus Christ,

0:21:08.720,0:21:14.140
He will continue to support you in your new life in Christ Jesus, in Jesus' name.

0:21:14.140,0:21:18.380
Shortly afterwards, Miss Emmanuella came back with her mother

0:21:18.380,0:21:22.020
to testify to the goodness of God in their lives.

0:21:22.020,0:21:23.860
Let's listen to them.

0:21:23.860,0:21:27.060
We welcome you to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.

0:21:27.060,0:21:29.760
Please tell us your name and of the person standing next to you.

0:21:29.760,0:21:31.760
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:21:31.760,0:21:34.080
My name is Emmanuella Amana.

0:21:34.080,0:21:35.460
I'm from Adamawa State.

0:21:35.460,0:21:39.600
The person standing beside me is my lovely mum, Mary.

0:21:39.600,0:21:41.920
Since your deliverance last week Sunday,

0:21:41.920,0:21:45.340
tell us - what are the changes you have received here.

0:21:45.340,0:21:46.780
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:21:46.780,0:21:49.900
I can sleep very well. I sleep like a baby.

0:21:49.900,0:21:52.320
I don't have nightmares anymore.

0:21:52.320,0:21:55.440
I even preach to people. I am happy.

0:21:55.440,0:21:58.960
I am just like a newborn baby, now.

0:21:58.960,0:22:03.680
What about the urge to smoke, drink alcohol, sleep with men?

0:22:03.680,0:22:04.820
What do you experience?

0:22:04.820,0:22:05.760
I don't have it.

0:22:05.760,0:22:09.600
I even sit down and imagine, "Was I doing all this?"

0:22:09.600,0:22:13.240
Was I the one who used to drink and not be able to do without it?

0:22:13.240,0:22:16.620
I don't have the urge anymore.

0:22:16.620,0:22:20.680
To God be the glory. So you mean, you are completely delivered, completely free?

0:22:20.680,0:22:22.780
Yes.

0:22:22.780,0:22:25.880
That is great. Let's hear a word from your mum too.

0:22:25.880,0:22:28.320
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:22:28.320,0:22:30.600
I see the change.

0:22:30.600,0:22:34.980
My daughter has changed and she is alright now.

0:22:34.980,0:22:40.360
I am happy to see her today like this.

0:22:40.360,0:22:43.820
And we believe that what God Almighty starts, He always finishes.

0:22:43.820,0:22:46.960
As He has started this wonderful transformation in your life,

0:22:46.960,0:22:52.300
we know that the end has not yet come; better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.

0:22:52.300,0:22:55.100
What is the next step you want to take in life now -

0:22:55.100,0:22:57.700
now that you are delivered, now that you are free?

0:22:57.700,0:23:05.540
I want to start a business, to take care of myself, my mother and my kids.

0:23:05.540,0:23:11.600
We know that this problem has really grounded your life and you have no other place to turn to.

0:23:11.600,0:23:15.260
On behalf of the Emmanuel TV partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:23:15.260,0:23:20.340
it is our privilege to present to you the sum of 150,000 Naira

0:23:20.340,0:23:23.920
to start up your new life in Christ Jesus.

0:23:23.920,0:23:25.860
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:23:25.860,0:23:33.720
All that I have to say is for God to bless the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:23:33.720,0:23:41.720
to keep him alive, to add more years to his life, more knowledge and understanding, in Jesus' name.

0:23:41.720,0:23:48.600
I feel happy. I feel joy.

0:23:48.600,0:23:52.260
We can see that, truly, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed

0:23:52.260,0:23:54.580
and our sister is weeping tears of joy.

0:23:54.580,0:23:59.140
She never believed that she could live a life of peace, security and comfort

0:23:59.140,0:24:02.700
and this is what Jesus has used this ministry to bring into her life.

0:24:02.700,0:24:05.700
We encourage you: You are delivered by the Word of God

0:24:05.700,0:24:07.820
and your deliverance shall remain permanent.

0:24:07.820,0:24:12.580
So now, continue to make our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ the Lord of all your days,

0:24:12.580,0:24:15.980
make God's Word the standard for your life, home and family,

0:24:15.980,0:24:20.400
and raise your children up in the way in the Lord and it shall be well with you all, in Jesus' name.

0:24:20.400,0:24:22.400
Amen! Emmanuel!

0:24:22.400,0:24:28.020
Thank You, Jesus!
