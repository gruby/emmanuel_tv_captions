0:00:03.780,0:00:07.240
There is a brother there - you are a witch doctor.

0:00:07.240,0:00:09.240
Let me call you a spiritualist.

0:00:09.240,0:00:11.600
That is the modern name now.

0:00:11.600,0:00:16.060
You cannot hear 'witch doctor' or 'babalawo' again.

0:00:16.060,0:00:18.500
All are now spiritualists.

0:00:18.500,0:00:19.680
Ok.

0:00:19.680,0:00:24.520
Modern spiritualist - he's here. Please, come.

0:00:24.520,0:00:26.520
Jesus loves you.

0:00:26.520,0:00:28.520
Hallelujah. Thank you.

0:00:28.520,0:00:29.960
Prophecy Time

0:00:29.960,0:00:33.220
I am a traditional doctor - a chief priest.

0:00:33.220,0:00:37.580
Chief priest, you wear a modern t-shirt?

0:00:37.580,0:00:38.900
Yes, sir.

0:00:38.900,0:00:43.800
Assuming I did not call you out, you would still go back to the life of a chief priest.

0:00:43.800,0:00:46.960
Can you move back - see the chief priest.

0:00:46.960,0:00:48.960
He wears the latest.

0:00:48.960,0:00:51.440
Prophecy Time

0:00:51.440,0:00:55.140
I told you, they are spiritualists nowadays.

0:00:55.140,0:00:58.940
You see the t-shirt and the latest canvas.

0:00:58.940,0:01:03.220
Prophecy Time

0:01:03.220,0:01:07.460
Man of God, everything you said about me is true.

0:01:08.200,0:01:11.640
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:12.060,0:01:14.200
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:14.200,0:01:17.580
I am Dr Samson Omaye.

0:01:17.580,0:01:21.140
I am from Edo State (Nigeria).

0:01:21.140,0:01:23.640
Dr Samson Omaye - Edo, Nigeria

0:01:23.640,0:01:27.980
This man is my younger brother.

0:01:27.980,0:01:30.740
He is also a community leader.

0:01:30.740,0:01:36.940
The next person is my immediate brother,  from the same community.

0:01:36.940,0:01:44.000
The next person is my elder brother - the head of our family.

0:01:44.000,0:01:47.300
The next person is my younger brother.

0:01:47.300,0:01:53.660
The brother in blue attire is a relative.

0:01:53.660,0:02:02.180
I am Dr Samson Omaye, the chief priest of sango and obaluaye.

0:02:02.180,0:02:04.420
What do you mean by that because many people do not understand?

0:02:04.420,0:02:09.640
These were the idols I worshipped.

0:02:09.640,0:02:13.800
They did some things for people who came to me for help.

0:02:13.800,0:02:16.400
In other words, you are a chief priest serving idols?

0:02:16.400,0:02:18.400
Yes, I served idols.

0:02:18.400,0:02:21.980
I served these idols for 35 years.

0:02:21.980,0:02:25.720
I reside in Ologbo, Edo State.

0:02:25.720,0:02:33.460
I want to testify about the prophecy the Man of God gave me on June 5,

0:02:33.460,0:02:38.400
when I came to The SCOAN.

0:02:38.400,0:02:41.580
I sat at the extreme end of the church.

0:02:41.580,0:02:46.440
The day I came to The SCOAN, I disguised myself.

0:02:46.440,0:02:52.540
I wanted to know if the Man of God would be able to identify me.

0:02:52.540,0:02:58.280
I came with jeans and a t-shirt.

0:02:58.280,0:03:02.280
The prophecy he gave me that day was very correct.

0:03:02.280,0:03:09.360
When people came to me, I would give them medicine and different charms

0:03:09.360,0:03:12.940
but at the end of the day, they would come and tell me that the things did not work.

0:03:12.940,0:03:15.460
I started realising many things in my life -

0:03:15.460,0:03:20.040
that this had been obstructing me and giving me problems.

0:03:20.040,0:03:24.560
Things were not working well with my family

0:03:24.560,0:03:27.200
and it gave me sickness and many other negative things.

0:03:27.200,0:03:35.740
Each time my wife gave birth, the baby would die; this happened four times.

0:03:35.740,0:03:40.700
So, I felt as a chief priest, why should I serve deities that were not working

0:03:40.700,0:03:43.080
but made me to suffer.

0:03:43.080,0:03:45.820
So, I wanted to denounce them and said that I didn't want to do it.

0:03:45.820,0:03:51.320
Each time I made a move, these things would strike me with stroke.

0:03:51.320,0:03:54.360
So, I would go back and serve them again.

0:03:54.360,0:03:57.700
After serving them, I would recover; this happened three times.

0:03:57.700,0:04:03.780
I was worried and complained to my younger brother who works here in Lagos.

0:04:03.780,0:04:10.460
I told him that I wanted to stop this job of serving idols because there was nothing good in it.

0:04:10.460,0:04:15.620
It has given me a lot of problems - no peace, resting or peace of mind.

0:04:15.620,0:04:18.940
Other people who also worked for them were also saying that it wasn't working for them.

0:04:18.940,0:04:20.540
So, what is the point.

0:04:20.540,0:04:24.120
My brother told me to come to The SCOAN.

0:04:24.120,0:04:25.980
I told him that I had never been to Lagos before.

0:04:25.980,0:04:30.160
Since I was born, I had never stepped into any church

0:04:30.160,0:04:35.220
because I believed that idol worshipping was the best.

0:04:35.220,0:04:39.320
He said that I should watch Emmanuel TV.

0:04:39.320,0:04:46.180
I installed DSTV, GoTV and MyTV and started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:04:46.180,0:04:52.400
I saw the way the Man of God was delivering people and I was excited.

0:04:52.400,0:04:56.740
I was convinced.

0:04:56.740,0:05:02.100
When I wanted to leave my place, I did not tell my family and wife

0:05:02.100,0:05:04.700
that I wanted to come to The SCOAN.

0:05:04.700,0:05:05.900
I told my wife that I wanted to travel.

0:05:05.900,0:05:08.900
My wife asked me where I was going and I told her not to ask me.

0:05:08.900,0:05:10.260
So, I left.

0:05:10.260,0:05:15.440
I took my jeans, t-shirt and canvas shoes and left.

0:05:15.440,0:05:18.140
That was why I came to The SCOAN that day.

0:05:18.140,0:05:20.540
I disguised myself and sat down.

0:05:20.540,0:05:27.800
I thought to myself, "If he is really a man of God, he will identify me. Let me see".

0:05:27.800,0:05:30.880
Indeed, he identified me.

0:05:30.880,0:05:39.280
He called me out and delivered me.

0:05:39.280,0:05:43.300
We only want to take you a bit backwards to when you said

0:05:43.300,0:05:46.620
you decided to come to The SCOAN through your brother

0:05:46.620,0:05:48.540
who introduced you to Emmanuel TV.

0:05:48.540,0:05:52.540
When you came, you said you intentionally disguised yourself?

0:05:52.540,0:05:54.540
Can you tell us why you disguised yourself. Why?

0:05:54.540,0:05:59.660
Because I wanted to know if the Man of God could identify me

0:05:59.660,0:06:06.280
as a witch doctor, spiritualist and chief priest.

0:06:06.280,0:06:08.640
That was why I disguised myself.

0:06:08.640,0:06:11.600
Ok. How did you feel at the moment when the Man of God spotted you out among the crowd?

0:06:11.600,0:06:14.860
When he spotted me out, I was very happy because that was the reason I came.

0:06:14.860,0:06:18.960
When he called me and I came out, the people who sat near me were looking at me

0:06:18.960,0:06:23.420
because the way I was dressed and disguised, they never knew that I was that type of person.

0:06:23.420,0:06:27.320
So, they held me but I removed their hands and said,

0:06:27.320,0:06:32.040
"Leave me, do you know the reason I am here? I came here for a reason".

0:06:32.040,0:06:36.580
When I came out, the usher asked me for proof that I was a witch doctor.

0:06:36.580,0:06:41.060
So, I brought the photographs to show them so that they could believe that I was the person.

0:06:41.060,0:06:48.420
The reason I want to quit this job - I served these deities for 35 years

0:06:48.420,0:06:53.800
but I encountered problems in my family and with my wife.

0:06:53.800,0:06:58.100
My wife gave birth to a baby four times but each time, the baby died.

0:06:58.100,0:07:03.400
The people I worked for would also come back and tell me that the charms were not working.

0:07:03.400,0:07:07.920
So, I decided to quit and that was why I came to The SCOAN.

0:07:07.920,0:07:13.540
I had bad dreams - I would fight with demons and they would chase me,

0:07:13.540,0:07:21.000
eating in my dream and they would hold cutlasses and axe and chase me in order to kill me.

0:07:21.000,0:07:28.260
These were the bad dreams I had at that time but after my deliverance, I slept like a baby.

0:07:28.260,0:07:29.580
There was nothing like that again.

0:07:29.580,0:07:34.640
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:07:34.640,0:07:38.040
We want to hear from you where those idols are that you are talking about.

0:07:38.040,0:07:43.060
The idols are outside, I decided to bring all of them here in order to denounce them.

0:07:43.060,0:07:44.400
You mean that you brought everything?

0:07:44.400,0:07:46.400
Yes, I brought everything from my shrine.

0:07:46.400,0:07:48.400
They are outside.

0:07:48.400,0:07:51.580
Dr Samson Omaye - Deliverance Testimony

0:07:51.580,0:07:53.020
They are outside.

0:07:53.020,0:07:55.020
Can you go and show us where they are.

0:07:55.020,0:08:06.220
Dr Samson Omaye - Deliverance Testimony

0:08:06.220,0:08:14.920
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:08:14.920,0:08:17.620
These are the idols; I brought all the idols.

0:08:17.620,0:08:24.420
These are the idols in my shrine because I don't need them anymore.

0:08:24.420,0:08:28.160
I don't want to serve them.

0:08:28.160,0:08:31.080
These are the deities; I don't want to serve them anymore.

0:08:31.080,0:08:34.300
I want to serve God; I want to serve Jesus.

0:08:34.300,0:08:36.520
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:08:36.520,0:08:43.080
This is the skin of a cow.

0:08:43.080,0:09:17.540
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:09:17.540,0:09:20.140
This is sango.

0:09:20.140,0:09:25.220
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:09:25.220,0:09:36.960
If anybody came for anything, from anywhere or asked anything, I would serve sango for the person.

0:09:36.960,0:09:43.000
From there, I would give it to the person to go with, for whatever they had requested it for.

0:09:43.000,0:09:50.660
At the end of the day, it didn't work them anymore.

0:09:50.660,0:09:57.300
This one is oleru.

0:09:57.300,0:10:01.000
This is oleru and ayelala.

0:10:01.000,0:10:05.060
I used it to work for people.

0:10:05.060,0:10:08.060
After working for them, I would give it to them to go with.

0:10:08.060,0:10:14.280
At the end of the day, it wouldn't work for them.

0:10:14.280,0:10:17.260
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:10:17.260,0:10:21.260
This one is olugbowu.

0:10:21.260,0:10:27.780
That is, after they had come for their consultation, I would use it to pray for them.

0:10:27.780,0:10:32.180
But in the long run, everything stopped working.

0:10:32.180,0:10:34.720
They would come back and complain.

0:10:34.720,0:10:40.140
I don't need to worship them anymore.

0:10:40.140,0:10:55.020
This is esu, the deity we used to send to work for people.

0:10:55.020,0:11:01.900
Esu means demon - satan. That is, the person they are casting out in the church.

0:11:01.900,0:11:08.300
We would send it to people and something would enter the person we sent it to.

0:11:08.300,0:11:11.000
This esu would go into that person.

0:11:11.000,0:11:14.060
It would motivate that person to do wrong, bad things.

0:11:14.060,0:11:16.540
The demon would be in that person to do wrong things.

0:11:16.540,0:11:21.220
Before an esu worshipper can serve sango and sango to get into that person,

0:11:21.220,0:11:24.800
he should tell esu to go out of that person.

0:11:24.800,0:11:26.800
That is the work of this.

0:11:26.800,0:11:31.900
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:11:31.900,0:11:35.720
This one is olugbowu.

0:11:35.720,0:11:39.380
After you serve esu, you need olugbowu.

0:11:39.380,0:11:41.780
That is it.

0:11:41.780,0:11:50.360
This one works together with esu to enable esu - that demon - to leave the person immediately.

0:11:50.360,0:11:52.060
That is it.

0:11:52.060,0:11:54.800
It destroys.

0:11:54.800,0:12:03.560
Then this one is orunmila.

0:12:03.560,0:12:09.460
After serving sango and everything, you serve orunmila to crown them all

0:12:09.460,0:12:16.640
so that it would enable the deities to work fast.

0:12:16.640,0:12:17.780
That is this.

0:12:17.780,0:12:20.140
Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine

0:12:20.140,0:12:30.260
This one is the head of a ram given to sango before he goes to work.

0:12:30.260,0:12:39.680
When they came, I would consult the Ifa to know the type of things he wanted to take from the person

0:12:39.680,0:12:42.140
before he went out to there to work for the person.

0:12:42.140,0:12:47.240
For instance, someone says that someone stole his property.

0:12:47.240,0:12:56.340
It is this deity that enters inside this person to go and steal from the person.

0:12:56.340,0:13:04.140
Before we did that, we would first serve esu, then give this ram to sango.

0:13:04.140,0:13:12.400
Then we would let esu go for the deity to come out of that person before sango would get there.

0:13:12.400,0:13:23.000
If not, sango cannot get that person arrested if the deity does not come out from the person's body.

0:13:23.000,0:13:29.580
This one is a calabash.

0:13:29.580,0:13:35.620
We don't use glass to serve sango; it is always a calabash.

0:13:35.620,0:13:41.040
Each one of these things has their own calabash we use to serve them.

0:13:41.040,0:13:47.900
This one is two - one for sango and one for ayelala and oleru.

0:13:47.900,0:13:50.160
It is two.

0:13:50.160,0:13:53.500
This one is the ram.

0:13:53.500,0:14:00.300
When we give sango the ram, they will then bring somebody to take the skin away.

0:14:00.300,0:14:06.160
Then the chief priest will use the skin to sit down to worship the deity.

0:14:06.160,0:14:08.820
That is how all of these things are made.

0:14:08.820,0:14:15.820
In line with your explanation, sir, you said these idols are no longer working?

0:14:15.820,0:14:16.500
Yes.

0:14:16.500,0:14:20.020
What do you mean? When they were working before, what kind of work were they doing?

0:14:20.020,0:14:22.780
They destroyed things.

0:14:22.780,0:14:25.900
They worked for destruction.

0:14:25.900,0:14:31.100
Now, I don't need to serve them anymore because they are destructive items.

0:14:31.100,0:14:36.960
So, I had to come and denounce them because it is not good for a human to serve them.

0:14:36.960,0:14:43.780
I want to tell my colleagues out there who are serving idols that they should stop serving them

0:14:43.780,0:14:45.340
because nothing good comes from there.

0:14:45.340,0:14:50.860
It is Jesus Christ that everybody should embrace and totally submit to.

0:14:50.860,0:15:00.320
There is no light in serving idols, when they give you a pot, they will take your stove.

0:15:00.320,0:15:04.280
Whatever they give to you, they will take it back a hundred times.

0:15:04.280,0:15:06.760
It is not good to serve deities.

0:15:06.760,0:15:08.760
Thank You, Jesus!

0:15:08.760,0:15:11.360
I am no longer serving idols.

0:15:11.360,0:15:15.080
I have given my life to Jesus.

0:15:15.080,0:15:20.540
Our father, we rejoice with you greatly for the deliverance and salvation you received

0:15:20.540,0:15:24.660
through the message of prophecy that came here at The SCOAN.

0:15:24.660,0:15:29.500
I also want to advise you by saying that as much as you have been delivered through the Word of God,

0:15:29.500,0:15:32.220
go and make His Word the standard for your life

0:15:32.220,0:15:35.300
and we pray as you go and maintain your salvation through the Word of God,

0:15:35.300,0:15:37.480
it will remain permanent in Jesus' name.

0:15:37.480,0:15:38.000
Amen.
