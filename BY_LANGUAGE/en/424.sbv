PROPHECY TIME

0:00:05.580,0:00:09.620
There is a dispute over a child.

0:00:09.620,0:00:14.320
You need to reconcile. There is need for a reconciliation.

0:00:14.320,0:00:17.300
It is true.

0:00:17.300,0:00:20.960
Sometimes, we don't know where our problem comes from.

0:00:20.960,0:00:25.900
We begin to ask God to bless us but sometimes, there are mountains somewhere

0:00:25.900,0:00:27.880
that are standing against us.

0:00:27.880,0:00:31.720
We may not see it as a problem but it is a mighty problem.

0:00:31.720,0:00:35.480
If this vision is not given to you, you will keep asking for a breakthrough.

0:00:35.480,0:00:38.880
There can be no breakthrough without this reconciliation.

0:00:38.880,0:00:41.140
Man of God, what you said about me is true.

0:00:41.140,0:00:45.800
Without this reconciliation, getting this girl, standing and coming out to say:

0:00:45.800,0:00:49.520
"I am the father", you cannot get it right in life.

0:00:49.520,0:00:52.240
Man of God, it is true.

0:00:52.240,0:00:55.380
Man of God, please help me. I want to get this baby back to my life.

0:00:55.380,0:00:58.760
Please help me, Man of God.

0:00:58.760,0:01:01.880
There was a time that they took you to a witch doctor.

0:01:01.880,0:01:03.060
Do you remember it?

0:01:03.060,0:01:04.040
It is true, Man of God.

0:01:04.040,0:01:05.840
You were looking for deliverance.

0:01:05.840,0:01:08.300
There was a time they gave you a handkerchief.

0:01:08.300,0:01:09.480
It is true.

0:01:09.480,0:01:10.380
Okay.

0:01:10.380,0:01:13.520
After your deliverance, you will get this child back.

0:01:13.520,0:01:17.680
And you will pay the woman and say: "Sorry". This woman will forgive you.

0:01:17.680,0:01:24.320
Now, you can start your life again.

0:01:24.320,0:01:27.980
Thank You, Jesus.

TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:33.280,0:01:36.920
After that prophecy and the man was delivered,

0:01:36.920,0:01:42.740
he went back to his country, and he was able to trace the lady.

SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:50.580,0:01:52.520
Since fourteen years.

0:01:52.520,0:01:53.880
Let me tell you about deliverance.

0:01:53.880,0:01:57.180
Once they talk to you - one-on-one - that is deliverance.

0:01:57.180,0:02:00.060
Question and answer is what they provide.

0:02:00.060,0:02:02.060
My name is Frank Dagbe.

0:02:02.060,0:02:04.260
I come from Ghana.

0:02:04.260,0:02:10.660
Firstly, I want to thank the man of God immensely for allowing himself to be used by God Almighty

0:02:10.660,0:02:14.560
to dig out the root cause of my problems.

0:02:14.560,0:02:23.100
I was here in December 2008 for breakthrough, and the man of God saw me.

0:02:23.100,0:02:27.760
I was sitting here and he said I was looking for breakthrough

0:02:27.760,0:02:30.480
but there is a dispute over a child in my life.

0:02:30.480,0:02:34.320
I should go and reconcile and thank this woman immensely

0:02:34.320,0:02:37.240
before there would be breakthrough in my life.

0:02:37.240,0:02:42.240
Actually, that was done and as I'm here,

0:02:42.240,0:02:47.720
I can say that there is a total breakthrough in my life.

0:02:47.720,0:02:49.940
Before then, things weren't going well.

0:02:49.940,0:02:53.820
That was why I came here because I was watching Emmanuel TV

0:02:53.820,0:02:58.300
and I saw what God uses the man of God to do in people's lives.

0:02:58.300,0:03:00.620
He came here for breakthrough -

0:03:00.620,0:03:04.040
there was no job, no money.

0:03:04.040,0:03:08.020
I said: "Look, this is the problem you have.

0:03:08.020,0:03:11.140
This is the root of your problem.

0:03:11.140,0:03:17.220
Some years past, there was a woman you abandoned.

0:03:17.220,0:03:20.520
You said you don't know; you are a small boy.

0:03:20.520,0:03:22.840
You are the owner of the child."

0:03:22.840,0:03:28.720
I said: "Don't worry. After this deliverance, you will just see the whole thing,

0:03:28.720,0:03:31.160
and they too will be looking for you.

0:03:31.160,0:03:33.900
As you are looking for them, they will be looking for you.

0:03:33.900,0:03:39.700
If they now see you, they will say, "Thank You, Jesus! We've been looking for you!"

0:03:39.700,0:03:44.800
SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:44.860,0:03:48.860
The man of God said that there is a dispute over a child.

0:03:48.860,0:03:52.960
Actually, before she was conceived, I denied her,

0:03:52.960,0:03:55.880
saying that I wasn't the one who impregnated her mother.

0:03:55.880,0:04:00.440
They came to meet my parents and then my father called me away from her parents

0:04:00.440,0:04:04.640
that I should accept it because he's also a man; he went through all

0:04:04.640,0:04:08.760
this when he was in school, that I should say the truth but I still denied it.

0:04:08.760,0:04:12.840
Clap for his father.

0:04:12.840,0:04:15.440
You see a good father.

0:04:15.440,0:04:20.080
His good father called him secretly and said: "Look, I'm a man.

0:04:20.080,0:04:28.440
What I'm seeing now, from the look of things, this pregnancy of three months -

0:04:28.440,0:04:30.200
you are the owner."

0:04:30.200,0:04:31.360
He said: "No, no, no!"

0:04:31.360,0:04:34.760
What the man of God said is nothing but the truth

0:04:34.760,0:04:39.780
because I never knew that that was the problem.

0:04:39.780,0:04:47.620
I even connived with one of my cousins to support me to deny her.

0:04:47.620,0:04:49.760
Glory be to God!

0:04:49.760,0:04:52.520
Look at the way God called me into his life.

0:04:52.520,0:04:56.340
He came from Ghana crying but the Lord said: "No, no, no!

0:04:56.340,0:05:01.660
That child of fourteen years ago you denied!

0:05:01.660,0:05:06.400
Go back and take the child. If not, you will be poorer than this".

0:05:06.400,0:05:08.860
I never knew that that was the problem.

0:05:08.860,0:05:11.780
Actually, I was looking for breakthrough.

0:05:11.780,0:05:16.180
I want to express my gratitude to the man of God for allowing himself

0:05:16.180,0:05:20.540
to be used immensely for my problem.

0:05:20.540,0:05:25.900
Now, after the prophecy, there is breakthrough in my life.

0:05:25.900,0:05:29.660
I've got a contract now. Even as I'm here, there was a phone call for me.

0:05:29.660,0:05:32.320
A contract is waiting for me in Ghana now.

0:05:32.320,0:05:35.860
Man of God, I thank you immensely for what God has used you to do in my life.

0:05:35.860,0:05:44.680
You have just started because I'm seeing you travel to Canada.

0:05:44.680,0:05:46.020
You should get ready.

0:05:46.020,0:05:47.660
Let's ask the little girl.

0:05:47.660,0:05:49.220
How are you feeling now,

0:05:49.220,0:05:52.520
now that you have discovered your father after fourteen years?

0:05:52.520,0:05:54.840
My name is Hilda Dagbe.

0:05:54.840,0:05:56.840
I am 14 years old.

0:05:56.880,0:06:00.080
I am happy to see my father now.

0:06:04.500,0:06:08.360
If not this message, this man would have denied forever.

0:06:08.360,0:06:15.940
The lady said I am happy now. After fourteen years, I am now able to know my father.

0:06:15.940,0:06:18.260
Man of God, I thank you.

0:06:18.260,0:06:22.420
I thank God for using you to tell my father

0:06:22.420,0:06:28.560
because when I'm in school, I've been seeing people's parents coming for them at school.

0:06:28.560,0:06:32.660
So, now I'm happy that I'm with my father.
