0:00:00.000,0:00:04.240
The doctor told me that they are going to amputate the arm of my son.

0:00:04.240,0:00:07.160
I was in pain since that time.

0:00:07.160,0:00:20.220
Please note: The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature and shows severe open wounds.

0:00:20.220,0:00:26.980
What this child is facing is a huge burden for such a young boy to bear.

0:00:26.980,0:00:31.680
This little boy has an arm ulcer at the age of 4.

0:00:31.680,0:00:36.680
At this age, he is supposed to be playing freely, running freely, enjoying life.

0:00:36.680,0:00:41.540
But how can he play with his friends with such a problem as this.

0:00:41.540,0:00:45.400
As you can see, satan's sicknesses are the thieves of joy.

0:00:45.400,0:00:47.140
Let's hear from his father.

0:00:47.140,0:00:51.100
My name is Adegoke Ogunade. I am 36 years old.

0:00:51.100,0:00:55.960
We can see a boy sitting on your lap. Who is he to you?

0:00:55.960,0:00:57.220
He is my son.

0:00:57.220,0:00:59.240
Can you tell us his name and his age.

0:00:59.240,0:01:03.880
His name is Favour Oluwatobi Ogunade. He is 4 years old.

0:01:03.880,0:01:07.500
What is the problem that has brought your son to The SCOAN today?

0:01:07.500,0:01:09.940
The problem is arm ulcer.

0:01:09.940,0:01:12.860
You mean your son is having the problem of arm ulcer?

0:01:12.860,0:01:13.900
Yes.

0:01:13.900,0:01:16.840
How has this problem of arm ulcer affected your son?

0:01:16.840,0:01:19.440
How has he been feeling with this problem?

0:01:19.440,0:01:23.640
He has not been alright. He cannot sleep.

0:01:23.640,0:01:33.000
We have spent a lot of money, going from one hospital to another for different treatments.

0:01:33.000,0:01:37.280
But still, there was no solution.

0:01:37.280,0:01:39.920
Who told you about The SCOAN?

0:01:39.920,0:01:43.920
One of my sisters told me to come here today, and

0:01:43.920,0:01:47.180
we believe that God is going to answer our prayer and heal him.

0:01:47.180,0:01:52.380
How do you feel as a father seeing your son in this kind of condition, with this kind of sickness?

0:01:52.380,0:01:58.980
I am not happy at all. I am not ok whenever I see his arm.

0:01:58.980,0:02:06.040
Now that you are here with your son at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty would do for him?

0:02:06.040,0:02:10.460
I believe God will heal him - totally heal and deliver him.

0:02:10.460,0:02:14.100
Amen. We pray with you that God Almighty will heal your son and

0:02:14.100,0:02:19.000
set him free from this sickness of arm ulcer, in Jesus' name.

0:02:19.000,0:02:21.680
Amen.

0:02:21.680,0:02:28.760
This boy is just minutes from his miracle because Jesus Christ is just a moment away.

0:02:28.760,0:02:32.680
Faith is a force that moves your words to work.

0:02:32.680,0:02:36.480
As Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying, he speaks the word of faith

0:02:36.480,0:02:42.380
to every giant, every Jericho, every problem in the lives in these people.

0:02:42.380,0:02:47.240
They have been taken out of their problem, and they shall not go back.

0:02:47.240,0:02:50.680
God is making a way where there seems to be no way.

0:02:50.680,0:02:54.800
Just as He did for Moses, when He divided the Red Sea.

0:02:54.800,0:02:58.920
Every wall is being crumbled. Every giant is being destroyed.

0:02:58.920,0:03:02.500
The foundation of every problem is being shakened.

0:03:02.500,0:03:09.920
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:03:09.920,0:03:11.080
Watch your screen.

0:03:11.080,0:03:15.800
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:03:15.800,0:03:18.880
Be free!

0:03:18.880,0:03:28.620
Let's see how God uses Prophet T.B. Joshua to command this boy's problem to go, in Jesus' name.

0:03:28.620,0:03:30.640
Be free!

0:03:30.640,0:03:32.400
In Jesus' name!

0:03:32.400,0:03:44.460
TESTIMONY TIME

0:03:44.460,0:03:47.020
My name is Adegoke Ogunade.

0:03:47.020,0:03:50.800
My son's name is Favour Ogunade.

0:03:50.800,0:03:53.220
He had the problem of arm ulcer.

0:03:53.220,0:03:56.680
I have been to many places looking for a solution.

0:03:56.680,0:04:02.260
One of my inlaws directed me here.

0:04:02.260,0:04:08.460
The day I came here, we were placed at the emergency section of the church.

0:04:08.460,0:04:11.880
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed for us that very day,

0:04:11.880,0:04:14.600
and that same day we saw the difference.

0:04:14.600,0:04:18.600
The doctors told me that they would have to amputate my son's arm.

0:04:18.600,0:04:21.380
I was in pain since that time.

0:04:21.380,0:04:30.400
But today, I thank God that I have the joy in testifying that my son is now healed.

0:04:30.400,0:04:37.820
Before, he had a big sore and even had difficulty in wearing clothes.

0:04:37.820,0:04:43.960
I thank God that today, there is no more sore, no more pain and no more crying.

0:04:43.960,0:04:50.380
Now, he can use his arm, play with his friends and go to school.

0:04:50.380,0:04:53.100
I give glory to Almighty God!

0:04:53.100,0:04:56.180
To God be the glory. For the benefit of those listening to you,

0:04:56.180,0:05:04.840
can you tell us what the things were that your son could not do then, because of his problem of arm ulcer?

0:05:04.840,0:05:10.480
Before, he could not play; he could not sleep.

0:05:10.480,0:05:12.940
In the night, he would cry in pain.

0:05:12.940,0:05:15.300
Now he is alright!

0:05:15.300,0:05:19.080
He can now go to school and play ball with his friends.

0:05:19.080,0:05:23.020
Now he can use his hand to eat, write and play.

0:05:23.020,0:05:25.420
I give glory to Almighty God.

0:05:25.420,0:05:28.660
We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in the life of your son.

0:05:28.660,0:05:30.700
For the benefit of those listening to you,

0:05:30.700,0:05:35.900
can you show us the spot where your son had that problem of arm ulcer.

0:05:35.900,0:05:38.280
Could you tap him like this before ?

0:05:38.280,0:05:39.960
No, I could not try it.

0:05:39.960,0:05:40.980
Why?

0:05:40.980,0:05:42.720
It was a big sore.

0:05:42.720,0:05:48.980
He was always in pain and crying, all day long.

0:05:48.980,0:05:52.560
But ever since you brought him, and the anointed man of God prayed for him,

0:05:52.560,0:05:59.040
and God Almighty set him free totally, he has been free indeed of the problem. Isn't it?

0:05:59.040,0:06:00.060
Yes.

0:06:00.060,0:06:05.300
We thank God. Now that the Lord has healed your son and released you of that problem,

0:06:05.300,0:06:11.280
the pain of taking him to places for solution, what is your promise to God?

0:06:11.280,0:06:14.580
My promise to God is to train my child in the way of the Lord

0:06:14.580,0:06:20.260
and serve Almighty God and I will go and sin no more.

0:06:20.260,0:06:24.280
We'll pray with you that the Lord will grant you the grace to see yourself as a foster

0:06:24.280,0:06:29.880
and train your child in the way of the Lord.

0:06:29.880,0:06:37.900
Before and After

0:06:37.900,0:06:39.800
To God be the glory!

0:06:39.800,0:06:42.620
His problem is a thing of the past.

0:06:42.620,0:06:45.440
His sorrow has been turned to joy.

0:06:45.440,0:06:47.960
Thank You, Jesus!

0:06:47.960,0:06:54.000
