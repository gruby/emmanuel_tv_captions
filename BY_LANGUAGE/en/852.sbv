0:00:00.000,0:00:08.140
Miss Danielle Kriel has come to The SCOAN from South Africa with the terrible problem of bipolar disorder.

0:00:08.140,0:00:14.520
At just 16 years old she has been tormented by this terrible problem for several years,

0:00:14.520,0:00:21.140
having to live in isolation and to be consistently watched due to her obsession with cutting her veins,

0:00:21.140,0:00:22.660
just to see blood.

0:00:22.660,0:00:26.940
The medical report clearly states the symptoms that have plagued Danielle's life,

0:00:26.940,0:00:33.660
as a result of the bipolar disorder; depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-harm.

0:00:33.660,0:00:41.280
The disturbing photographs by her side show Danielle's self-inflicted wounds in an attempt to commit suicide.

0:00:41.280,0:00:46.220
We can also see a "missing child" notice, showing how the bipolar disorder

0:00:46.220,0:00:50.360
had even caused this young teenager to run away from home.

0:00:50.360,0:00:54.600
There are demonic forces that cause people to be bowed down in bondage.

0:00:54.600,0:01:01.180
Now, in the arena of liberty, the demonic forces behind the bondage of this young girl are about to be exposed

0:01:01.180,0:01:04.280
and disconnected, in Jesus' name.

0:01:04.280,0:01:06.080
Let's listen to her.

0:01:06.080,0:01:10.820
My name is Danielle Kriel; I’m 16 years old, and I’m from South Africa.

0:01:10.820,0:01:13.060
Who is the person sitting next to you?

0:01:13.060,0:01:14.080
It’s my mum.

0:01:14.080,0:01:21.040
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is mental disorder – bipolar disorder,

0:01:21.040,0:01:27.660
borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic depression.

0:01:27.660,0:01:34.500
I also have the problem of self-harm and suicidal tendencies.

0:01:34.500,0:01:37.800
For how many years have you had all these problems?

0:01:37.800,0:01:39.960
For nine years.

0:01:39.960,0:01:41.220
I can’t go to school.

0:01:41.220,0:01:42.500
I do home-schooling.

0:01:42.500,0:01:44.540
I also have panic attacks.

0:01:44.540,0:01:50.240
I can’t wear short sleeves because I have to hide the cuts and scars.

0:01:50.240,0:01:55.000
I would have anxiety and rage attacks in school.

0:01:55.000,0:01:58.960
So, that made it impossible for me to go to school and I had to have home-schooling.

0:01:58.960,0:02:04.640
Normally, I would just rush out of the classroom, go to the bathroom

0:02:04.640,0:02:13.580
and there, I would either cut myself or punch the walls or I would bite – anything to inflict pain.

0:02:13.580,0:02:16.240
It was always on yourself, not towards others?

0:02:16.240,0:02:22.680
No - it was always on myself but I felt the urge to do it to others; that is why I isolate myself -

0:02:22.680,0:02:24.540
not to do it on others.

0:02:24.540,0:02:30.240
Can you show us your arms and the scars you are talking about?

0:02:30.240,0:02:32.700
These are all the scars.

0:02:32.700,0:02:34.440
Some of them have faded.

0:02:34.440,0:02:40.660
There are a few like this one where I almost died – it was near fatal – these two.

0:02:40.660,0:02:44.540
It is only by the grace of God that I am still alive.

0:02:44.540,0:02:49.980
The multiple scars that criss-cross her arms tell their own story of pain and agony,

0:02:49.980,0:02:58.180
as the addiction to cutting herself and seeing blood has almost taken her life.

0:02:58.180,0:03:02.260
What is it that makes you start cutting and harming yourself?

0:03:02.260,0:03:10.100
Most of the time, it’s when emotionally, I am too overwhelmed and I can’t cope.

0:03:10.100,0:03:11.400
Then, I would get into a rage.

0:03:11.400,0:03:18.000
Also, when I feel the urge to hurt others, I will do it to myself instead before I would calm down

0:03:18.000,0:03:20.580
so that I would not hurt others.

0:03:20.580,0:03:27.440
It is satisfying to see the blood and even sometimes, I get the urge to drink the blood.

0:03:27.440,0:03:30.640
It is also satisfying and numbs every emotion.

0:03:30.640,0:03:36.960
It cuts everything off – I become like a total zombie and don’t have to face reality.

0:03:36.960,0:03:43.120
The first time, it lasted a long time and then, as I cut more and more, it lasted a shorter time

0:03:43.120,0:03:46.440
and I had to cut deeper to get the same effect.

0:03:46.440,0:03:51.580
So, when you were cutting yourself - how do you normally go about that?

0:03:51.580,0:03:53.860
Sometimes, I would do it on impulse.

0:03:53.860,0:03:58.900
I would just grab something and randomly slice wherever I can.

0:03:58.900,0:04:08.880
I used razor blades, glass and the blades of sharpeners.

0:04:08.880,0:04:12.080
Sometimes, it’s on impulse – I just grab something and do it;

0:04:12.080,0:04:17.540
at other times, I plan it for a long time and then do it.

0:04:17.540,0:04:22.200
Anytime this rage comes upon you and you don't have the opportunity to cut yourself,

0:04:22.200,0:04:24.460
how does this affect you; what else do you do?

0:04:24.460,0:04:29.660
Then, I start biting, scratching and eating walls.

0:04:29.660,0:04:34.740
Normally, when there is someone there, I will isolate myself and then do it

0:04:34.740,0:04:38.480
because I know I can’t make any noise.

0:04:38.480,0:04:45.020
I would just use anything I could find and if that was not enough, I would break a mirror.

0:04:45.020,0:04:52.520
I would use anything sharp I could find to cut and inflict pain.

0:04:52.520,0:04:55.300
Have you tried to stop these kind of things by yourself?

0:04:55.300,0:04:58.240
I can’t stop; it has gotten worse and worse.

0:04:58.240,0:05:01.000
I have to do it; I can’t stop.

0:05:01.000,0:05:04.040
You mentioned that you have had suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

0:05:04.040,0:05:09.120
Tell us - what were some of the close encounters you have had.

0:05:09.120,0:05:11.380
There has been quite a few.

0:05:11.380,0:05:15.800
The latest one was that I drank poison.

0:05:15.800,0:05:23.560
The one before that, I am not sure; it was amitraz – something to kill fleas and dogs.

0:05:23.560,0:05:25.300
I found it in the cupboard.

0:05:25.300,0:05:31.240
I prepared everything and wrote notes and took everything.

0:05:31.240,0:05:37.180
Just a while before that, I cut and I cut too deep.

0:05:37.180,0:05:42.200
I hit the artery and bled almost completely out.

0:05:42.200,0:05:46.560
The doctor said I had 30 millilitres of blood left in me.

0:05:46.560,0:05:52.660
So, it was only by the grace of God that He kept me alive, that I didn’t die in that incident.

0:05:52.660,0:05:58.780
Also, on numerous times, I have overdosed on pills – any pills I could find.

0:05:58.780,0:06:03.460
I have tried hanging myself and every time, it just failed.

0:06:03.460,0:06:09.400
It either has no effect on me or someone just comes and interrupts and stops it.

0:06:09.400,0:06:11.560
Every time, something just stops it.

0:06:11.560,0:06:15.880
Now, you are here at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty will do for you?

0:06:15.880,0:06:19.420
I believe He will deliver me and set me free completely and then

0:06:19.420,0:06:25.280
I will have a relationship with Him and be able to help others in the same situation as me

0:06:25.280,0:06:29.420
who isn’t understood and I can help them through the grace of God.

0:06:29.420,0:06:30.300
Amen.

0:06:30.300,0:06:35.320
We believe with you that God Almighty will heal you completely and set you free, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:06:35.320,0:06:36.300
Amen.

0:06:36.300,0:06:38.040
Let's hear a word from your mother.

0:06:38.040,0:06:42.200
I am Mrs Kriel, from South Africa and I am the mother of Danielle.

0:06:42.200,0:06:45.540
I must watch her 24/7, 365.

0:06:45.540,0:06:54.500
It is quite a job – to be a watcher, to hear any sounds,

0:06:54.500,0:07:00.040
all the knives and every sharp item, there is nothing there -

0:07:00.040,0:07:06.140
even stuff to clean the house, I lock it away.

0:07:06.140,0:07:09.300
My weapons, I lock them away in the safe.

0:07:09.300,0:07:16.580
My marriage – I nearly divorced my husband because it has an influence on our family life.

0:07:16.580,0:07:21.340
I myself have rage and I can’t take it anymore.

0:07:21.340,0:07:27.940
A friend suggested that we must come to The SCOAN and get deliverance from God.

0:07:27.940,0:07:33.540
How did you first discover this problem in the life of your daughter?

0:07:33.540,0:07:37.140
At the age of 12, the teacher phoned me.

0:07:37.140,0:07:42.260
She was doing home-schooling in a centrum and the teacher phoned me

0:07:42.260,0:07:45.300
that I should quickly come to the office.

0:07:45.300,0:07:51.300
I drove to her office and then she informed me that Danielle had cut herself.

0:07:51.300,0:07:55.500
From there on, I was watching her.

0:07:55.500,0:07:59.120
She would go from friend to friend watching Danielle

0:07:59.120,0:08:03.360
because I was the sole breadwinner at that stage.

0:08:03.360,0:08:06.420
After work, I would pick her up.

0:08:06.420,0:08:14.460
At one stage, she was staying with friends on a farm for 10 months and they would look after Danielle.

0:08:14.460,0:08:21.460
We took her to the institution, Denmar in South Africa but it was not successful

0:08:21.460,0:08:27.260
and the doctors stated that she was supposed to be in an institute for the rest of her life.

0:08:27.260,0:08:32.220
Now, you are here at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty will do for your daughter?

0:08:32.220,0:08:34.180
He will deliver her completely.

0:08:34.180,0:08:37.620
Amen. We believe with you that God Almighty will deliver both you and your daughter,

0:08:37.620,0:08:39.060
in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:08:39.060,0:08:41.120
Amen.

0:08:41.120,0:08:45.720
DELIVERANCE TIME

0:08:45.720,0:08:47.780
Man of God, deliver me!

0:08:47.780,0:08:51.140
I’ve been struggling with self-harm and suicide.

0:08:51.140,0:08:56.440
Please, Man of God, have mercy on me!

0:08:56.440,0:08:59.040
I cut myself.

0:08:59.040,0:09:00.820
I have been doing this since 12.

0:09:00.820,0:09:03.840
Please, Man of God, deliver me!

0:09:03.840,0:09:07.720
We can't take it anymore. 
Please, God!

0:09:07.720,0:09:14.760
It’s spiritual attacks – evil spirits.

0:09:14.760,0:09:20.520
Stuff which happened to her as a child – she never told me.

0:09:20.520,0:09:30.060
Many times – more than 20, 30 – she is cutting her veins.

0:09:30.060,0:09:33.000
Man of God, please, help me!

Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:10:39.800,0:10:47.380
My name is Danielle Kriel, I'm 16 years old, I'm from South Africa, and this is my mum.

0:10:47.380,0:10:52.440
The problem that brought me here, to The SCOAN was:

0:10:52.440,0:11:02.800
I had cut myself since the age of 12 very badly, I attempted suicide numerous times,

0:11:02.800,0:11:06.780
and I was diagnosed with a lot of disorders -

0:11:06.780,0:11:13.920
bipolar disorder, border line personality disorder, and chronic depression.

0:11:13.920,0:11:18.740
It all started when I was about 6 years old.

0:11:18.740,0:11:26.920
I was sexually abused till the age of about 10, numerous times by numerous people.

0:11:26.920,0:11:34.560
Since the age of 8 I started biting and scratching and bruising - just lightly.

0:11:34.560,0:11:40.620
I wasn't sure what it did to me, it just made me feel better.

0:11:40.620,0:11:44.780
When I was 12 years old, I started cutting.

0:11:44.780,0:11:53.140
I was institutionalized for that and they told me that I would be in an institution for the rest of my life

0:11:53.140,0:11:59.580
and I would be on medications; that it was only manageable, not treatable.

0:11:59.580,0:12:03.960
Then, my suicidal attempts also started.

0:12:03.960,0:12:13.400
From then till now I have attempted suicides almost 120 - 150 times, and that's not even exaggerating.

0:12:13.400,0:12:21.420
We really fought it a lot and my parents couldn't really cope with this, so I was living with other families.

0:12:21.420,0:12:29.620
Every time my parents sent me away to other families, I would try not to mess up;

0:12:29.620,0:12:36.620
but then I would cut or attempt suicide, and they would send me back to my parents again.

0:12:36.620,0:12:42.680
When I messed up at my parents, they would send me back, so it was back and forth rejection the whole time.

0:12:42.680,0:12:46.840
The first time I attempted suicide - it was an overdose;

0:12:46.840,0:12:50.440
I overdosed on pills that I found in my mum's cupboard.

0:12:50.440,0:12:52.940
I have done it many times.

0:12:52.940,0:12:58.100
There were few near-death experiences as a result of that.

0:12:58.100,0:13:06.440
I have also taken poison and it made me sick but it didn't kill me.

0:13:06.440,0:13:09.120
I tried hanging myself.

0:13:09.120,0:13:14.720
At one point, when I was at my grandmother's house, I found a gun

0:13:14.720,0:13:21.500
and I thought that I could end it finally but then the grace of God stepped in:

0:13:21.500,0:13:25.800
As I held it in my hand, I just couldn't pull the trigger.

0:13:25.800,0:13:35.120
There were times when I would try to hit the vein, the artery to bleed out and to finally die.

0:13:35.120,0:13:42.040
When I was 12, I went on the internet and I literally typed it out on how to commit suicide.

0:13:42.040,0:13:47.920
It is surprising how many sites are there, encouraging people,

0:13:47.920,0:13:52.140
giving them methods how to commit suicide.

0:13:52.140,0:13:58.320
They encourage; they don't say, "Please, don't do it", they give structured methods how to do it -

0:13:58.320,0:14:03.520
step one, step two...

0:14:03.520,0:14:06.760
I've got a few ideas on that as well.

0:14:06.760,0:14:10.140
I've tried to electrocute myself.

0:14:10.140,0:14:18.340
I thought that if I could step in the bath with water, and I would cut a cable while it was plugged in and on,

0:14:18.340,0:14:26.620
and put it in the water, that it would electrocute me but it didn't work.

0:14:26.620,0:14:35.180
Recently, at the end of the last year, I was sleeping and then I woke up and I was in rage,

0:14:35.180,0:14:45.560
and I just thought to end it all - I grabbed the blade and I cut here, I hit the artery.

0:14:45.560,0:14:49.220
I cut it almost completely off.

0:14:49.220,0:14:53.180
I almost bled out.

0:14:53.180,0:14:58.040
The people I was staying with rushed me to the hospital; I was unconscious -

0:14:58.040,0:15:01.600
I couldn't really remember anything.

0:15:01.600,0:15:06.500
I remember; while I was there, I said, "I don't want to die".

0:15:06.500,0:15:11.680
I remember saying that when I felt that I was so close to death.

0:15:11.680,0:15:15.020
In the hospital, when I woke up and they got me stabilized,

0:15:15.020,0:15:22.820
the doctor told me that I had 30 millilitres of blood left inside of me.

0:15:22.820,0:15:28.600
He told me, "You have no idea how close to death you were".

0:15:28.600,0:15:37.400
It is physically impossible to even survive the drive from the house to the hospital on 30 ml of blood,

0:15:37.400,0:15:39.320
and I did, by the grace of God.

0:15:39.320,0:15:42.600
I didn't have brain damage or any other damage,

0:15:42.600,0:15:48.140
but by the time I got there, my organs started to fail and shut down,

0:15:48.140,0:15:51.020
but they didn't have any damage.

0:15:51.020,0:15:59.760
The first time I attempted it, I overdosed on pills because I thought that was the best way to do it,

0:15:59.760,0:16:04.840
and nothing happened, so I thought maybe I was doing it wrong.

0:16:04.840,0:16:13.760
I thought about going online; there must be a lot of people that have done it.

0:16:13.760,0:16:21.380
I just thought I could look for ideas there, and they gave me a lot of bad ideas.

0:16:21.380,0:16:25.540
It was really bad that they encouraged me.

0:16:25.540,0:16:32.040
I even asked there what the best, fastest and surest way to kill oneself was

0:16:32.040,0:16:36.960
if one has limited weapons or anything

0:16:36.960,0:16:43.920
because at that time, I was monitored by my mum, and I wouldn't have any weapons,

0:16:43.920,0:16:51.580
so I went to see what ordinary things I could use to kill myself.

0:16:51.580,0:16:58.120
I read that if you overdose on dettol, if you take a lot of it, it can kill you.

0:16:58.120,0:17:00.740
I have tried that but it also didn't work.

0:17:00.740,0:17:06.180
So you mean you physically drank dettol - the liquid - in an attempt to commit suicide?

0:17:06.180,0:17:12.600
Yes, they said that if you took enough of it, your lungs would swell up,

0:17:12.600,0:17:16.480
your heart would stop and you would die.

0:17:16.480,0:17:20.960
When I was 12, I started cutting.

0:17:20.960,0:17:25.440
From then till now, the cutting has gotten worse and worse.

0:17:25.440,0:17:32.860
At the beginning one cut would be enough to numb every emotion,

0:17:32.860,0:17:37.280
but the more I cut, the deeper I had to go.

0:17:37.280,0:17:40.120
I wanted to see the blood flow.

0:17:40.120,0:17:43.180
The craving was more to see the blood.

0:17:43.180,0:17:52.500
At the later stage, I started craving not to just see the blood, but also to drink the blood.

0:17:52.500,0:17:55.520
I started to crave that more and more.

0:17:55.520,0:18:05.900
The first thing that came was pain, an extreme emotional pain - it felt unbearable.

0:18:05.900,0:18:08.320
It came so suddenly.

0:18:08.320,0:18:17.660
After that thing, there was extreme rage.

0:18:17.660,0:18:26.120
Whether I wanted to do it or not, I still felt that I had to do it - I was like pushed into doing it.

0:18:26.120,0:18:34.460
It was like I would shut down and get everything ready and do it, regardless if I wanted it or not -

0:18:34.460,0:18:37.300
I just didn't have any control.

0:18:37.300,0:18:43.720
So, there was a force beyond your control, this urge that was pushing you to kill yourself and see blood?

0:18:43.720,0:18:47.580
Yes, it was.

0:18:47.580,0:18:53.540
I have tried to resist it on my own, but I just couldn't.

0:18:53.540,0:19:00.420
What about your dreams; can you describe to us the kind of attacks you were having spiritually in the nights?

0:19:00.420,0:19:02.280
Yes.

0:19:02.280,0:19:10.600
Since I was 8 years old, I had really bad nightmares.

0:19:10.600,0:19:18.200
I would dream about wild animals - tigers, wolfs attacking me,

0:19:18.200,0:19:25.780
I would dream of people abusing me in every kind of way.

0:19:25.780,0:19:35.480
I started to experience sleep paralysis; that was really horrifying to me.

0:19:35.480,0:19:42.520
I really didn't get a lot of sleep at all - it was really rare for me.

0:19:42.520,0:19:46.380
Either I would go to sleep and have a nightmare and when I woke up,

0:19:46.380,0:19:50.760
I didn't want to go back to sleep again because the dream would just continue,

0:19:50.760,0:19:56.480
or the whole night would be just a struggle to get the rage out that I was feeling,

0:19:56.480,0:20:01.200
and not to make any noise that somebody might come in and try to stop me.

0:20:01.200,0:20:11.400
The month before I came to The SCOAN, the attacks were getting worse and worse.

0:20:11.400,0:20:19.840
I would go for like a week without sleeping one night at all - just no sleep.

0:20:19.840,0:20:26.260
When I tried to sleep during the day, I would wake up and be in a rage.

0:20:26.260,0:20:37.740
Only in the month before I came here, I attempted suicide more than 15-20 times.

0:20:37.740,0:20:48.500
Even the night before I came here, I decided to end everything, that I mustn't come here,

0:20:48.500,0:20:51.220
I must die before I come here.

0:20:51.220,0:20:55.800
I don't know why but I was really scared.

0:20:55.800,0:21:01.740
We watched the movie "The Shack" about God's love, and I remember going to my room,

0:21:01.740,0:21:08.100
and I prayed to God and said, "God, I see Your love but I don't experience it".

0:21:08.100,0:21:15.960
Right then, they came into my room and told me, "You are flying to The SCOAN tomorrow".

0:21:15.960,0:21:22.140
I was so overwhelmed that I just gave the blades and the glass up.

0:21:22.140,0:21:26.940
Nothing really bad happened; because in the past, if I would give up blades,

0:21:26.940,0:21:33.000
I would experience hell, it would be a torture for more than a week -

0:21:33.000,0:21:36.720
I would really experience torture because I gave the blades up.

0:21:36.720,0:21:40.520
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:21:40.520,0:21:45.100
We understand that the night before our sister came here to The SCOAN,

0:21:45.100,0:21:48.460
she actually was very close to committing suicide,

0:21:48.460,0:21:52.780
but to the glory of God, that was the night she was told she would be coming to the church,

0:21:52.780,0:21:57.720
and she submitted the blades that she had secretly found, with which she wanted to end her life,

0:21:57.720,0:22:00.780
and God brought her here today, to The SCOAN.

0:22:00.780,0:22:06.060
Sister, we saw in the clip earlier; as Prophet T.B. Joshua approached you, you were crying out,

0:22:06.060,0:22:10.600
and suddenly, as he began to pray, your hands began to shake and vibrate.

0:22:10.600,0:22:15.580
Could you just describe to us, for the glory of God, what happened to you at that moment,

0:22:15.580,0:22:18.820
as Prophet T.B. Joshua began to pray for you?

0:22:18.820,0:22:23.860
As he was standing in front of me, I held the photos, and he started shaking his hands,

0:22:23.860,0:22:29.920
and I just started shaking uncontrollably; I couldn't control it.

0:22:29.920,0:22:37.500
I can't really say what I felt - it was as if I was in kind of a fog.

0:22:37.500,0:22:46.340
Then he touched me on my head; it really hurt bad, and it felt like lightening or something had struck me.

0:22:46.340,0:22:50.440
So, all of that time you were not even conscious of yourself, when you were crying,

0:22:50.440,0:22:56.500
when that demon was manifesting, you just felt an electric shock hit you, as Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed?

0:22:56.500,0:22:57.420
Yes.

0:22:57.420,0:23:00.160
Have you ever experienced anything like that before?

0:23:00.160,0:23:03.120
No, never.

0:23:03.120,0:23:07.400
In the church I am now in South Africa - it is really a living church -

0:23:07.400,0:23:14.840
they have prayed for me a lot of times, but nothing would happen.

0:23:14.840,0:23:19.160
But now, to the glory of God; it has been one week since this encounter with Jesus Christ -

0:23:19.160,0:23:24.340
can you just testify to the world, what are the changes that you have seen in your life ever since then?

0:23:24.340,0:23:26.360
The changes are really incredible.

0:23:26.360,0:23:34.460
When he finally touched me, I felt lighter, I knew something left me, and I knew I was finally free.

0:23:34.460,0:23:39.780
My thoughts - they have really changed.

0:23:39.780,0:23:49.560
Normally my thoughts would be negative, disturbing and I didn't like it.

0:23:49.560,0:23:57.200
I would look at anything as a method to hurt myself, or to commit suicide;

0:23:57.200,0:23:59.100
anything could become a weapon.

0:23:59.100,0:24:01.740
Now, that is gone.

0:24:01.740,0:24:07.880
I can look at glass and knives and the thought wouldn't even come up.

0:24:07.880,0:24:14.760
As I looked on the tape, I saw the pictures of my open wounds, and normally that would satisfy me;

0:24:14.760,0:24:17.420
the deeper the wound, the more satisfaction,

0:24:17.420,0:24:23.940
but now, it really scared me to think that I really did that to myself.

0:24:23.940,0:24:32.880
In the past week, I really slept well - that's one thing that has changed completely.

0:24:32.880,0:24:37.420
I didn't have any nightmares in this whole week, which is really great,

0:24:37.420,0:24:43.480
because most of my life I had a nightmare or two every night.

0:24:43.480,0:24:47.480
I haven't experienced sleep paralysis even once.

0:24:47.480,0:24:50.240
I haven't had the urge to cut even once.

0:24:50.240,0:24:59.040
And the most important thing is: The pain of the past is over - it is over, and it doesn't hurt anymore.

0:24:59.040,0:25:03.780
Anything of the past is over - it is now just a testimony to glorify God.

0:25:03.780,0:25:08.060
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:25:08.060,0:25:14.280
So, since that encounter, the negative, suicidal thoughts have disappeared?

0:25:14.280,0:25:15.920
Yes.

0:25:15.920,0:25:24.220
I don't have any thought of hurting myself - everything is gone.

0:25:24.220,0:25:27.960
In the past week, my faith has grown so much.

0:25:27.960,0:25:29.900
I have experienced God's love for me.

0:25:29.900,0:25:34.640
Last week Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "Heaven knows you are here".

0:25:34.640,0:25:38.320
This week I experienced it.

0:25:38.320,0:25:41.180
It was so overwhelming for me to realise

0:25:41.180,0:25:47.420
that Heaven, the Creator of everything, He is interested in this situation.

0:25:47.420,0:25:51.080
I looked back on what happened in the past, and I thought,

0:25:51.080,0:25:57.480
"Wow, the devil really tried to stop me, so there must be an awesome testimony, future and destiny

0:25:57.480,0:26:00.200
that he doesn't want me to step into".

0:26:00.200,0:26:03.960
Now, giving my testimony is the first step into my destiny.

0:26:03.960,0:26:08.460
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:26:08.460,0:26:11.240
All these are the scars that I...

0:26:11.240,0:26:17.700
Many of them have faded a lot, but these are no more to remind me of my past,

0:26:17.700,0:26:22.200
but rather they are a testimony to glorify Jesus.

0:26:22.200,0:26:30.280
My advice is: Anyone who is in my situation - do not give up hope, there is always hope.

0:26:30.280,0:26:39.320
There was a loving person who helped me; she paid for me to come here to The SCOAN.

0:26:39.320,0:26:45.960
She unconditionally loved me, like a mother, she was always there for me and supported me.

0:26:45.960,0:26:54.480
I know now, it was God loving me through her, God showing me His love through her.

0:26:54.480,0:26:58.560
Do not give up hope - by His stripes we are healed.

0:26:58.560,0:27:03.000
He has already shed every drop of blood for you.

0:27:03.000,0:27:07.220
You don't have to try to cover it with your own, because it is not going to work.

0:27:07.220,0:27:10.420
He already did everything for you.

0:27:10.420,0:27:13.800
People of God, the reason we are listening to this testimony and asking these questions

0:27:13.800,0:27:18.200
is to really encourage the world with what Jesus Christ is doing here.

0:27:18.200,0:27:25.200
The spirit that our sister was delivered from is the same spirit that we are seeing in operation around the world,

0:27:25.200,0:27:31.900
pushing people to join terrorist, militant groups that are involved in suicide bombing.

0:27:31.900,0:27:34.840
We read every day and see on the news what is happening.

0:27:34.840,0:27:40.240
This is the spirit that our sister was delivered from; a spirit that would push her to kill herself,

0:27:40.240,0:27:44.080
and even if she couldn't kill herself, that same spirit would eventually push her

0:27:44.080,0:27:45.980
to also end the lives of others.

0:27:45.980,0:27:50.080
As you heard her say earlier, the spirit was actually pushing her just to see blood,

0:27:50.080,0:27:53.960
and she tried to isolate herself because she felt if she was in the public,

0:27:53.960,0:27:56.940
she would even injure or maim others as well.

0:27:56.940,0:28:00.780
We can imagine the spirit that we are talking about, that our sister was delivered from.

0:28:00.780,0:28:05.440
That spirit is what is pushing people to travel overseas to join terrorist groups,

0:28:05.440,0:28:12.680
to actually end their own lives and kill innocent people, just to try to satisfy that evil spirit.

0:28:12.680,0:28:15.260
We give glory to God that our sister was delivered.

0:28:15.260,0:28:18.180
If not for this deliverance, who knows what would have happened.

0:28:18.180,0:28:20.460
Perhaps she would not only have ended her life,

0:28:20.460,0:28:24.700
but that spirit would have pushed her to also injure and affect others as well.

0:28:24.700,0:28:29.860
The light of God that exposed that spirit and sent the darkness packing in her,

0:28:29.860,0:28:34.040
that is the light of God that is present here, in the arena of liberty.

0:28:34.040,0:28:37.140
It is time for us to celebrate that light.

0:28:37.140,0:28:42.200
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:28:42.200,0:28:47.160
Yes; when the light of God speaks, darkness has no hiding place.

0:28:47.160,0:28:52.940
We can see clearly that our sister is completely delivered from that wicked, tormenting spirit,

0:28:52.940,0:28:57.840
that wanted at all costs for her to end her life, to see blood, to kill herself and others.

0:28:57.840,0:29:01.960
Today, she is free, and that same power of God that set her free

0:29:01.960,0:29:08.140
is available for those who are ready and open to receive.

0:29:08.140,0:29:10.140
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:29:10.140,0:29:14.940
I'm Mara Kriel and I'm the mother of Danielle Kriel.

0:29:14.940,0:29:21.020
During this week, after the deliverance of Danielle, she sleeps completely through the night,

0:29:21.020,0:29:28.660
she doesn't have nightmares anymore, and the other thing is: She is very optimistic and enthusiastic.

0:29:28.660,0:29:35.900
She is talking a lot; in the past she didn't talk much to me, she avoided me, she was quiet.

0:29:35.900,0:29:42.400
She is completely changed - 180 degrees from what she was and what she now is.

0:29:42.400,0:29:50.320
Glory to God, and to the man of God, and to the people who support and sponsored us to come here.

0:29:50.320,0:29:54.620
All glory to God for His mercy and His grace.

0:29:54.620,0:29:58.540
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:29:58.540,0:30:03.900
Madam, as her mother, could you just compare her life before she came here to the differences now -

0:30:03.900,0:30:13.200
just give us a quick example of her life before and to the changes you have seen since that deliverance.

0:30:13.200,0:30:23.860
When she was still sick, I was watching her 24/7, and it took a toll on me.

0:30:23.860,0:30:31.800
She was not focusing, she was acting like a zombie, so to speak.

0:30:31.800,0:30:34.600
This even had an influence on my work.

0:30:34.600,0:30:40.400
I feel rest, complete peace now that she is here and she has been delivered.

0:30:40.400,0:30:45.000
She sleeps during the night and she is fine.

0:30:45.000,0:30:46.000
I'm very grateful.

0:30:46.000,0:30:51.020
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:30:51.020,0:30:54.500
Don't despair, God is there for everybody.

0:30:54.500,0:31:04.320
Jesus Christ gave His blood for us and we are created in the image of God.

0:31:04.320,0:31:10.680
Through the blood of Jesus Christ we can be saved, if we allow Him, if we act upon His Word,

0:31:10.680,0:31:15.640
and if we obey Him, there is hope for us; there is salvation.

0:31:15.640,0:31:23.400
There is joy, peace - only God can give peace.

0:31:23.400,0:31:28.100
Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.

0:31:28.100,0:31:31.720
Thank You, Jesus - I'm completely free!

0:31:31.720,0:31:38.700
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:31:38.700,0:31:41.300
My name is Danielle Kriel and I'm from South Africa.

0:31:41.300,0:31:47.480
Three weeks ago I was delivered from the spirit of suicide.

0:31:47.480,0:31:53.180
My life has completely changed around; I couldn't sleep, now I sleep like a baby throughout the night,

0:31:53.180,0:32:00.660
I don't have any more nightmares, no more depressive thoughts, everything is positive,

0:32:00.660,0:32:09.460
I'm getting happy again and I'm thinking about my future - something that I normally didn't do.

0:32:09.460,0:32:14.220
I've been so blessed in these 3 weeks - it has been a really awesome experience.

0:32:14.220,0:32:17.980
My faith has grown so much.

0:32:17.980,0:32:23.300
I've learnt so much through the lectures every Sunday service - it has been really amazing.

0:32:23.300,0:32:25.660
I'm feeling awesome; I'm very strong.

0:32:25.660,0:32:31.620
My spiritual life has really grown - I feel confident in my relationship in Jesus Christ.

0:32:31.620,0:32:35.280
These 3 weeks changed my life.

0:32:35.280,0:32:39.920
I'm really going back a wholly different person than the person that came here.

0:32:39.920,0:32:47.960
No more thoughts of suicide, depression, of hurting myself or others.

0:32:47.960,0:32:51.760
No more negative thoughts; everything is positive; thinking about the future,

0:32:51.760,0:32:56.420
praying a lot and engaging with God - my relationship has grown stronger.

0:32:56.420,0:33:01.540
With my mum, the reconciliation also happened; and the relationship with God.

0:33:01.540,0:33:07.620
Even to come here, we couldn't afford to come here - someone had to sponsor us to come here,

0:33:07.620,0:33:12.560
where I stayed for 3 months - this person said she was going to pay for us coming here.

Our sister is fully equipped to go back to her home, to her country,

0:33:16.180,0:33:19.320
and maintain the deliverance, and to make the Word of God the standard for her life.

0:33:19.320,0:33:23.560
Sister, right now, we actually have a wonderful message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:33:23.560,0:33:28.900
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua said on behalf of himself and Emmanuel TV partners around the world,

0:33:28.900,0:33:33.200
he really wants to support you, as you start your new life in Christ Jesus,

0:33:33.200,0:33:35.260
returning back to your country - South Africa.

0:33:35.260,0:33:39.900
Especially in the area of your academic life, and to provide for you and your mum,

0:33:39.900,0:33:44.720
Prophet T.B. Joshua said he is here to present to you the gift of $2000.

0:33:44.720,0:33:55.320
Thank You, Jesus!

0:33:55.320,0:33:57.820
We needed this.

0:33:57.820,0:34:02.020
We didn't expect this coming here, we just expected deliverance.

0:34:02.020,0:34:05.160
We have been blessed so much, spiritually and financially.

0:34:05.160,0:34:08.520
We have been blessed with the faith tools - thank you, man of God.

0:34:08.520,0:34:10.640
Thank You, Jesus.

0:34:10.640,0:34:14.200
Do not give up hope; no matter how dark things seem.

0:34:14.200,0:34:19.240
God will use one of His servants, someone that is willing to listen to Him,

0:34:19.240,0:34:23.300
to shine His light and His love in your darkness.

0:34:23.300,0:34:25.520
I have experienced it.

0:34:25.520,0:34:29.240
It seemed that there was no hope - this was my last bus stop,

0:34:29.240,0:34:31.920
and I said, "If this doesn't work, then nothing is going to work".

0:34:31.920,0:34:35.580
There is always hope - never lose hope; hope in Christ Jesus.

0:34:35.580,0:34:37.640
I'm Mara Kriel, I'm from South Africa.

0:34:37.640,0:34:39.620
She is delivered completely.

0:34:39.620,0:34:43.300
She is so happy, enthusiastic.

0:34:43.300,0:34:48.420
She is now talking about the future; things which she didn't do in the past.

0:34:48.420,0:34:49.620
I'm very grateful.

0:34:49.620,0:34:52.880
Thank God, for His mercy and His grace.

0:34:52.880,0:35:03.020
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua - to give us this gift on his birthday - we are very grateful.

0:35:03.020,0:35:12.520
And I thank God for my daughter - I've got my daughter back - she is talented.

0:35:12.520,0:35:21.700
May she just expand in her spiritual life and wisdom.

0:35:21.700,0:35:26.880
Really, I'm overwhelmed, because I've got so many financial constraints.

0:35:26.880,0:35:36.300
When I'm going back, there are a lot of things to pay and this money will come in very handy.

0:35:36.300,0:35:42.700
Just for Danielle - for her education, I will not worry for that part anymore.

0:35:42.700,0:35:45.300
That's wonderful - thank you, man of God.

0:35:45.300,0:35:48.420
Never despair, God is there.

0:35:48.420,0:36:00.140
Even if your life is in a dark pit, never give up hope, because God is light, He is Spirit, He is Love.

0:36:00.140,0:36:04.560
We are created in the image of God.

0:36:04.560,0:36:13.840
If He is interested in making a small snowflake, with such detail - just for a while, and then it fades away,

0:36:13.840,0:36:18.660
it melts - how much more does He care about me and you.

0:36:18.660,0:36:21.060
We are in His image.

0:36:21.060,0:36:22.880
What can I say?

0:36:22.880,0:36:24.920
Thank God.

0:36:24.920,0:36:28.400
Thank You, Jesus!
