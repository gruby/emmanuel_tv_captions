0:00:00.000,0:00:03.920
"Come unto Me all ye that labour."

0:00:03.920,0:00:08.800
Here are Your children; they have come to You, Lord.

0:00:08.800,0:00:14.580
Every affliction in their blood, disease in their blood -

0:00:14.580,0:00:19.600
wherever it is located, I release them, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:19.600,0:00:36.360
You disease - out, in the name of Jesus!

0:00:36.360,0:00:41.880
Command them out!

0:00:41.880,0:00:51.120
Wherever it is - in your faculties - distance is not a barrier.

0:00:51.120,0:00:55.980
I say to that affliction, "Leave my people!"

0:00:55.980,0:01:00.020
I say to that disease, "Leave my people!"

0:01:00.020,0:01:04.100
I say to that sickness, "Leave my people!"

0:01:04.100,0:01:12.020
Leave my people!

0:01:12.020,0:01:17.120
In the name of Jesus!

0:01:17.120,0:01:22.200
Viewers all over the world, begin to walk out of disease.

0:01:22.200,0:01:27.540
I feel the touch of Jesus.

0:01:27.540,0:01:31.940
Walk out of disease!

0:01:31.940,0:01:33.980
I can see you being delivered.

0:01:33.980,0:01:36.080
I can see you being healed.

0:01:36.080,0:01:41.320
I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:41.320,0:01:43.900
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:01:43.900,0:01:49.940
Viewers all over the world, if it is true for your life that you are healed and delivered,

0:01:49.940,0:01:53.420
begin to confess your deliverance, confess your healing.

0:01:53.420,0:01:57.640
If it is true for you, you are healed!

0:01:57.640,0:02:04.520
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:02:04.520,0:02:10.220
If the Word of God is true for your life, say, "I am healed; I am delivered!"

0:02:10.220,0:02:12.980
Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:02:12.980,0:02:14.320
I can't hear you.

0:02:14.320,0:02:15.720
[Thank You, Jesus!]

0:02:15.720,0:02:18.660
Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:02:18.660,0:02:21.400
Mean it!
