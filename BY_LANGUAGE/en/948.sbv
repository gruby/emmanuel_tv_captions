Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:00:01.060,0:00:07.580
My name is Georgiana Saffa, born in Sierra Leone, settled down in UK.

0:00:07.580,0:00:10.860
I'm 55 years old.

0:00:10.860,0:00:13.320
I have been living in the UK for 25 years.

0:00:13.320,0:00:16.360
All my life in the UK had been full of sickness.

0:00:16.360,0:00:19.480
I never had any quality time in the UK.

0:00:19.480,0:00:25.080
I started to work, settled down and bought houses.

0:00:25.080,0:00:31.160
I have about three houses in London through the job I was doing – a very good job -

0:00:31.160,0:00:36.940
helping women in the community who were trying to settle down in the country,

0:00:36.940,0:00:41.940
trying to go to college, start their own business or get a job.

0:00:41.940,0:00:46.600
That was the job I was doing – very demanding – running around for them.

0:00:46.600,0:00:49.860
At one stage, they even called my house, Social Services house

0:00:49.860,0:00:54.660
because as soon as somebody arrived, the first person they would call was me.

0:00:54.660,0:00:56.860
... accommodation problem, everything.

0:00:56.860,0:00:59.420
The job was going very well for me in London.

0:00:59.420,0:01:04.360
My life was very good; I was driving a very good, brand new car.

0:01:04.360,0:01:09.040
In London, we drive by registration; every year, the car that comes out -

0:01:09.040,0:01:11.640
you'll drive it and people will think you have money.

0:01:11.640,0:01:12.880
I didn't have any problems.

0:01:12.880,0:01:16.300
At one stage, the government gave me a car to drive.

0:01:16.300,0:01:18.380
I was very popular in London.

0:01:18.380,0:01:22.940
I got a job in the MP's office.

0:01:22.940,0:01:30.220
I became a campaign manager for the whole of Westminster – North.

0:01:30.220,0:01:40.520
I was employed in this office which is part of the Labour Party.

0:01:40.520,0:01:46.940
Whenever elections came up, I was one of the permanent staff that participated in the process.

0:01:46.940,0:01:50.080
I went to the polling station, amongst other things.

0:01:50.080,0:02:00.260
This is me on the picture with the MP - Karen Buck, in Westminster City Council.

0:02:00.260,0:02:01.680
It is the office I used to work in.

0:02:01.680,0:02:04.240
She was my very close friend.

0:02:04.240,0:02:05.520
This is our president.

0:02:05.520,0:02:13.680
When he came to London, they told him that I was helping a lot of Sierra Leoneans that were refugees.

0:02:13.680,0:02:17.600
I was the one helping them around and the president was happy about it.

0:02:17.600,0:02:21.740
That's my last son - this is the one they took from me when I was in the hospital.

0:02:21.740,0:02:23.860
Now, he is 17 years old.

0:02:23.860,0:02:32.060
These are my two daughters - about three weeks ago they visited me in Ghana for the first time.

0:02:32.060,0:02:35.420
Everything was going very well for me.

0:02:35.420,0:02:42.320
Then, I started to have chronic headaches.

0:02:42.320,0:02:49.960
I told my younger sister who is a nurse about my headache and inability to sleep.

0:02:49.960,0:02:56.480
She replied that it was alarming and that I should go to my doctor for a brain scan.

0:02:56.480,0:03:01.740
At that time, I was still working but my behaviour in the office was so bad

0:03:01.740,0:03:05.080
that they set up a camera to monitor me in the office, without my knowledge.

0:03:05.080,0:03:10.320
So all along, while I was fighting my colleagues, they were recording it.

0:03:10.320,0:03:15.500
One day, the manager rang me and told me that he wanted to see me in the office, that there was a problem.

0:03:15.500,0:03:17.480
I said, "OK, I will come".

0:03:17.480,0:03:23.620
When I got there, they played back the recordings of all my aggressive misbehaviours.

0:03:23.620,0:03:27.700
Even the way I spoke to customers on the phone was all recorded.

0:03:27.700,0:03:33.000
They told me that my situation was very severe and so they could no longer employ me.

0:03:33.000,0:03:34.900
They told me to go and seek for help.

0:03:34.900,0:03:38.420
Immediately I told my sister, she said I should see my doctor.

0:03:38.420,0:03:39.940
I was sent for an MRI scan.

0:03:39.940,0:03:47.140
The first scan that was done, I was told that the nerves between my brain cells were becoming swollen.

0:03:47.140,0:03:50.140
That was why I was getting blood clots on my eyes.

0:03:50.140,0:03:52.320
I couldn’t sleep properly.

0:03:52.320,0:03:54.500
All these problems were arising.

0:03:54.500,0:03:57.300
I was put on medication.

0:03:57.300,0:04:06.460
Initially, it was one but I ended up on 14 different types of medication.

0:04:06.460,0:04:11.800
Some of them were for my mood and some caused me kidney problems.

0:04:11.800,0:04:13.900
But I thank God for Jesus that it has gone.

0:04:13.900,0:04:16.120
My problems are gone.
I thank God.

0:04:16.120,0:04:26.980
These documents were from my GP in London stating the medication I was on.

0:04:26.980,0:04:34.760
I had medication for mood, sleep, asthma and gas.

0:04:34.760,0:04:41.480
I had bleeding because of too much medication in my system.

0:04:41.480,0:04:43.220
All that caused me headaches.

0:04:43.220,0:04:45.460
I was going through a lot of problems.

0:04:45.460,0:04:52.320
These problems became a big agony for me such that my children had to be taken away from me immediately.

0:04:52.320,0:05:01.140
I was not happy having my children taken away from me but they were little and didn't have a choice,

0:05:01.140,0:05:03.760
unless you are 16 years of age.

0:05:03.760,0:05:06.580
Babies can be taken away.

0:05:06.580,0:05:08.320
My children were put into foster care.

0:05:08.320,0:05:10.780
Seeing my children was a problem for me.

0:05:10.780,0:05:14.680
It took a while for me to come to myself.

0:05:14.680,0:05:21.960
They started to monitor me with my children.

0:05:21.960,0:05:25.720
Video cameras would be on me to see the way I behaved with them.

0:05:25.720,0:05:33.880
After one or two hours, I would be told that the meeting with my children was over.

0:05:33.880,0:05:43.640
At that time, I would get pregnant by different types of men who would take advantage of me.

0:05:43.640,0:05:51.840
I had about eight abortions and seven children by different fathers.

0:05:51.840,0:05:54.620
Some of them didn’t even know their fathers.

0:05:54.620,0:05:57.120
They would ask me where their dad was and I would reply that I didn't know -

0:05:57.120,0:06:01.080
at that time, I was on drugs and very sick.

0:06:01.080,0:06:07.820
You mean to say, madam - because of this problem, you had seven children with six different men?

0:06:07.820,0:06:08.640
Yes.

0:06:08.640,0:06:12.240
And majority of your children don't know who their father is?

0:06:12.240,0:06:13.560
Of course, yes.

0:06:13.560,0:06:17.340
Even now, I don't know what to tell them.

0:06:17.340,0:06:28.060
All this led me being neglected, even by my family, 15 of whom I brought to London.

0:06:28.060,0:06:30.060
None of them came to help me.

0:06:30.060,0:06:31.540
I was very neglected.

0:06:31.540,0:06:34.300
Nobody cared about my health.

0:06:34.300,0:06:39.940
They were even laughing at me, stating that I was a mad woman – mentally ill, that I was finished.

0:06:39.940,0:06:42.960
Because of this sickness, I gave my life to Christ.

0:06:42.960,0:06:44.920
I was born as a Muslim.

0:06:44.920,0:06:50.300
OK. Sorry, before going ahead, madam - you mentioned that because the situation became so serious,

0:06:50.300,0:06:53.840
the government actually had to take your children from you.

0:06:53.840,0:06:58.640
What was your behaviour at home that caused the government to come and

0:06:58.640,0:07:03.660
take all of your seven children away from you, to put them into foster care?

0:07:03.660,0:07:07.320
I couldn’t look after myself or my children.

0:07:07.320,0:07:09.940
They were neglected – going to school dirty.

0:07:09.940,0:07:11.980
Sometimes, they would not even go to school.

0:07:11.980,0:07:15.120
In the morning, I would just close my door and say, "Today, no school!"

0:07:15.120,0:07:19.760
The school rang social services to inform them that my children were not coming to school.

0:07:19.760,0:07:26.460
Social services intervened, came to my house and took my children away from me.

0:07:26.460,0:07:28.900
Ms Georgiana Saffa
Morning Water Testimony

0:07:28.900,0:07:31.540
At that time, I wanted to commit suicide.

0:07:31.540,0:07:37.980
I was living on the third floor but they put me on the ground floor because of my suicide attempts.

0:07:37.980,0:07:39.920
OK, you said you attempted suicide.

0:07:39.920,0:07:44.640
How did you actually try to go about this, because of this mental disorder you were having at this time?

0:07:44.640,0:07:49.080
I attempted suicide about five or six times.

0:07:49.080,0:07:55.240
When they got to know, they put me on the ground floor and put me on Suicide Watch.

0:07:55.240,0:08:01.560
Even when I was in the toilet and bathroom, in my house, somebody had to be with me all the time -

0:08:01.560,0:08:07.560
watching me, taking record of how I was behaving and what was happening in my life.

0:08:07.560,0:08:12.040
When you were on the third floor - was it that you attempted to jump?

0:08:12.040,0:08:17.140
Yes, I attempted to jump about five times.

0:08:17.140,0:08:24.480
One of my daughters saw me doing it and told the police that her mum wanted to commit suicide.

0:08:24.480,0:08:29.920
I think we can all understand the severity of our sister's problem,

0:08:29.920,0:08:34.240
to the extent that she had to be monitored 24/7.

0:08:34.240,0:08:36.360
She was placed under Suicide Watch.

0:08:36.360,0:08:42.480
Someone had to be with her all the time because of the severity of her mental condition,

0:08:42.480,0:08:46.280
that actually pushed her to attempt suicide on numerous occasions.

0:08:46.280,0:08:54.140
Just before that you said that this actually led many different men to use and abuse you.

0:08:54.140,0:08:55.340
What do you mean by that?

0:08:55.340,0:09:01.040
How would you meet such men and how would they take advantage of you, in your mental problem?

0:09:01.040,0:09:05.360
I am a very popular woman in London.

0:09:05.360,0:09:10.760
I had male friends but had no relationship with them.

0:09:10.760,0:09:19.740
When they knew I was sick and not all that strong, some of them would come to me as friends,

0:09:19.740,0:09:23.860
stating that only they understood my problem, that I shouldn't worry as they would be with me

0:09:23.860,0:09:29.300
but as time went on, when I would tell them I was pregnant by them, they would just disappear.

0:09:29.300,0:09:33.460
With the pregnancies, the government said that as I could not look after myself,

0:09:33.460,0:09:35.260
I couldn't look after my children.

0:09:35.260,0:09:39.020
So, some of the children were taken from me while I was in hospital.

0:09:39.020,0:09:45.020
The day I would get pregnant, they would monitor me, take me to hospital and do everything for me.

0:09:45.020,0:09:49.180
The day of my delivery, I wouldn’t even go through labour; they would do a caesarean

0:09:49.180,0:09:53.280
because they didn’t want me to go through labour in case I killed the child.

0:09:53.280,0:09:56.400
They would just operate on me, take the baby and immediately,

0:09:56.400,0:09:59.700
the foster parents would be there to collect the baby from me.

0:09:59.700,0:10:01.260
I didn't breastfeed at all.

0:10:01.260,0:10:06.020
The moment you gave birth to these children, they were taken away by the government immediately?

0:10:06.020,0:10:08.980
Immediately, they had to go.

0:10:08.980,0:10:13.600
Some of them, I wouldn’t see for 10 or 15 years.

0:10:13.600,0:10:15.500
Some of them 22 years.

0:10:15.500,0:10:21.700
It is now they are coming into my life by the grace in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:10:21.700,0:10:25.960
Thank You, Jesus!

0:10:25.960,0:10:32.300
Once again, we are just asking this question for everyone to understand the severity of the situation.

0:10:32.300,0:10:39.100
Before our sister came to The SCOAN by the grace of God, she had given birth to so many children

0:10:39.100,0:10:44.340
but she was not even able to stay with them as a mother because of her mental condition,

0:10:44.340,0:10:47.820
even to the point that some of her last children, as she gave birth to them,

0:10:47.820,0:10:52.500
right there and then in the hospital, they were taken away and put into foster care.

0:10:52.500,0:10:57.480
They were brought up without even knowing their mother because of the severity of her condition.

0:10:57.480,0:11:03.080
So madam, you said that you had tried so many different means to get solution to this problem,

0:11:03.080,0:11:05.000
before you came to The SCOAN.

0:11:05.000,0:11:12.260
Can you just mention again some of the diverse places you went to, trying to get rid of this problem?

0:11:12.260,0:11:18.100
The first time I entered church - I have a friend, she is from Uganda – she came to my house

0:11:18.100,0:11:22.360
and told me that I was a very nice person but that I needed to follow her to church.

0:11:22.360,0:11:26.260
This lady ran after me for over six months.

0:11:26.260,0:11:33.260
One day, my mum was with me and told me to follow my friend to the church, that Jesus could heal me.

0:11:33.260,0:11:40.160
Immediately, I got up, changed my clothes and followed the lady to the church.

0:11:40.160,0:11:43.060
When she took me to church, I gave my life to Christ.

0:11:43.060,0:11:48.460
I started going to different churches, sleeping in the church, even on the floor.

0:11:48.460,0:11:50.060
I would lie down in the church.

0:11:50.060,0:11:55.140
People would laugh at me, jeering, "You haven't seen nothing yet. This is not going to go away".

0:11:55.140,0:12:05.140
I travelled to Mali, Senegal and Gambia to do different sacrifices.

0:12:05.140,0:12:11.760
People who knew me would contribute money and tell me to go to different places to seek healing.

0:12:11.760,0:12:14.820
You said that when you went to these countries, you did sacrifices.

0:12:14.820,0:12:15.840
What do you mean by that?

0:12:15.840,0:12:18.540
Can you explain what happened when you went there?

0:12:18.540,0:12:25.420
When I got for the sacrifices, they would tell me that the devil could do this and that.

0:12:25.420,0:12:32.120
They would tell me to buy a big cow, pray on it and my sickness would go away.

0:12:32.120,0:12:34.300
I even have some of the pictures of that.

0:12:34.300,0:12:38.140
My sickness would subdue but when I would return, it would get worse

0:12:38.140,0:12:42.140
and they would have to hospitalise me, straight into the mental hospital.

0:12:42.140,0:12:46.840
I would not receive any solution at all.

0:12:46.840,0:12:52.200
So, you were a regular customer at the psychiatric hospitals in London because of this condition?

0:12:52.200,0:12:53.620
Yes.

0:12:53.620,0:12:54.300
OK.

0:12:54.300,0:12:59.820
Now, in the midst of all of this, you said earlier that by the special grace of God you went to Ghana,

0:12:59.820,0:13:02.800
where you were introduced to The SCOAN.

0:13:02.800,0:13:08.820
Repeat for us, madam - what happened when you had the opportunity to come here to The SCOAN

0:13:08.820,0:13:11.480
and receive the Morning Water.

0:13:11.480,0:13:16.940
When I came here with my friend, I was privileged to get the Morning Water

0:13:16.940,0:13:20.360
which my friend encouraged me to use.

0:13:20.360,0:13:21.640
I told her I had been using too many things.

0:13:21.640,0:13:24.400
She told me that this was my last bus stop.

0:13:24.400,0:13:26.280
I replied, "In the name of Jesus!"

0:13:26.280,0:13:31.560
I started taking it instead of the tablets.

0:13:31.560,0:13:35.120
The first day the Morning Water was ministered to me in The SCOAN, Ghana branch,

0:13:35.120,0:13:40.320
I went home and slept like a baby.

0:13:40.320,0:13:43.860
I slept so much that they had to wake me up to take breakfast.

0:13:43.860,0:13:47.900
I complained that I hadn’t slept for a long time, that they should let me sleep.

0:13:47.900,0:13:51.080
So before this time, how was your sleep like?

0:13:51.080,0:13:54.040
I was on two different types of sleeping tablets.

0:13:54.040,0:13:56.320
You must know how severe my situation was.

0:13:56.320,0:14:04.260
Not only one tablet; one is 48 mg, I have them with me, the other one is about 36 mg.

0:14:04.260,0:14:13.200
I had to take both tablets together to sleep but even with that, the sleep would not come.

0:14:13.200,0:14:18.480
I even overdosed myself at one stage.

0:14:18.480,0:14:21.720
I ended up in hospital.

0:14:21.720,0:14:26.460
I was put on a drip to flush all the medication that was in my system.

0:14:26.460,0:14:30.360
I nearly killed myself that time.

0:14:30.360,0:14:35.760
Our sister was actually dependant, addicted to taking tablets to be able to sleep.

0:14:35.760,0:14:39.660
After you received the Morning Water, that night you were able to sleep peacefully

0:14:39.660,0:14:41.980
for the first time in many years?

0:14:41.980,0:14:43.780
All my life.

0:14:43.780,0:14:48.380
I slept, I said that this one was very serious.

0:14:48.380,0:14:51.380
Thank You, Jesus!

0:14:51.380,0:14:56.980
As I was going back to London, I got the Morning Water and went with it.

0:14:56.980,0:14:59.620
While I was in London, I was ministering it throughout.

0:14:59.620,0:15:10.100
I refused to take my medication which raised an alarm among the doctors.

0:15:10.100,0:15:16.880
But luckily, the type of doctors that I had, they were very understanding; they were Christians.

0:15:16.880,0:15:19.960
They said that they understood that God could heal.

0:15:19.960,0:15:28.300
They asked me where I went and I told my GP that I was in The SCOAN in Nigeria.

0:15:28.300,0:15:31.440
He said, "You have done well; I am happy for you".

0:15:34.840,0:15:40.260
That's not enough.
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:40.260,0:15:45.400
This is a situation truly beyond the power of nature.

0:15:45.400,0:15:50.160
We don't try, in any way, to suggest that the medical doctors cannot help or assist people in this situation,

0:15:50.160,0:15:55.700
but it is clear for all to hear that our sister's case was beyond the power of human comprehension,

0:15:55.700,0:15:59.800
it was beyond the power of nature, it required divine intervention.

0:15:59.800,0:16:04.720
That is how after receiving the Morning Water, our sister stopped taking all the medications

0:16:04.720,0:16:07.120
she was dependant on, for so many years.

0:16:07.120,0:16:11.480
We can just see... what is it that you are holding there, madam?

0:16:11.480,0:16:13.620
These are some of the medications.

0:16:13.620,0:16:17.360
I didn’t want to see them anymore; so, I took them out of the packet and threw them away.

0:16:17.360,0:16:21.460
I just have the empty packets with me now because I don’t want to see them anymore.

0:16:21.460,0:16:23.720
They are my enemies.

0:16:27.460,0:16:33.760
Our sister is holding just few examples of the many different types of tablets she was taking to try

0:16:33.760,0:16:40.080
to relieve her situation - a very severe case of mental problem coupled with severe headaches,

0:16:40.080,0:16:45.880
alongside different other medical problems: hypertension, very severe eye problem.

0:16:45.880,0:16:49.340
So many different health complications that really crippled our sister's life.

0:16:49.340,0:16:52.320
She was doing very well in the UK in a prominent job.

0:16:52.320,0:16:56.160
Everything went downhill, after very severe migraine headaches struck.

0:16:56.160,0:16:59.980
But we give glory to God that she has been restored by our Lord, Jesus Christ.

0:16:59.980,0:17:04.700
Madam, as you are standing here right now to the glory of God, how is your health condition right now?

0:17:04.700,0:17:06.640
My health is perfect.

0:17:06.640,0:17:09.640
I have even lost weight as I am not taking the tablets anymore.

0:17:09.640,0:17:13.580
I was almost a size 22; now, I am size 16.

0:17:13.580,0:17:20.560
I am a brand new woman, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth and the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:17:20.560,0:17:25.720
Thank You, Jesus!

0:17:25.720,0:17:31.480
That very severe headache that initially started with all these mental problems - do you mean it is gone?

0:17:31.480,0:17:32.380
It's gone.

0:17:32.380,0:17:38.440
I don’t experience any problems, not even sleeping problems; now, I sleep like a baby.

0:17:38.440,0:17:40.180
I can fall asleep even while sitting.

0:17:40.180,0:17:43.200
Now, I even take coffee so as not to sleep!

0:17:43.200,0:17:44.680
Can you believe that?

0:17:44.680,0:17:46.120
Wow, thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:17:46.120,0:17:51.740
Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!

0:17:51.740,0:17:57.000
Finally madam, you said that right now, after Jesus Christ has restored your health, to the glory of God,

0:17:57.000,0:18:03.180
you have begun to reconcile with some of your children, that actually you had never seen,

0:18:03.180,0:18:05.840
right since birth, because of the severity of your problem.

0:18:05.840,0:18:10.360
You mean that by now, by the grace of God, you have been able to reconcile and meet with some of them?

0:18:10.360,0:18:15.700
Yes, three of my children came to visit me; they were in Ghana three weeks ago.

0:18:15.700,0:18:21.020
They came to visit me for the first time.

0:18:21.020,0:18:27.880
When they came, they were shocked and said, "Mummy, you have changed! You behave like a small girl."

0:18:27.880,0:18:30.900
I told them that I am a brand new woman now.

0:18:30.900,0:18:32.520
Everything has changed in my life.

0:18:32.520,0:18:37.400
They were surprised that I was behaving like a small girl.

0:18:37.400,0:18:43.700
Previously, we would fight and they would abandon me and go and stay in a hotel.

0:18:43.700,0:18:50.860
But now, we sleep, eat, go out and do everything together.

0:18:50.860,0:18:53.000
I went shopping with them.

0:18:53.000,0:18:58.340
I will follow them to the airport whereas before, I would say, "I am not going; I'm not feeling good".

0:18:58.340,0:19:00.780
But now, they are very happy.

0:19:00.780,0:19:08.720
I took them to The SCOAN branch in Ghana.

0:19:08.720,0:19:11.120
At the moment, they watch on Youtube.

0:19:11.120,0:19:17.060
They are very happy and have asked me to bring the Morning Water for them.

0:19:17.060,0:19:19.440
Hallelujah! This is indeed a radical transformation.

0:19:19.440,0:19:25.180
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:19:25.180,0:19:26.620
Wow, thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:19:26.620,0:19:27.960
We give all the glory to God.

0:19:27.960,0:19:33.500
There are no natural words to describe what Jesus Christ has done in the life of our sister, except to say,

0:19:33.500,0:19:34.960
"Thank You, Jesus".

0:19:34.960,0:19:40.320
Finally, madam, this Morning Water that you are holding right now - what is your advice to the world,

0:19:40.320,0:19:44.280
and your encouragement to the world concerning the wonderful blessing of God

0:19:44.280,0:19:49.340
that you are holding right now, that God used as an instrument to restore your sanity, health,

0:19:49.340,0:19:54.400
after so many years wandering in such a terrible problem?

0:19:54.400,0:20:01.000
This Morning Water is so wonderful that I can't even go without it.

0:20:01.000,0:20:06.140
Don’t joke with it, no matter what type of situation you are going through, what type of sickness,

0:20:06.140,0:20:08.900
or problem you are facing.

0:20:08.900,0:20:12.080
Find the solution.

0:20:12.080,0:20:14.600
Morning Water is the best - it can solve...

0:20:14.600,0:20:22.020
If it can solve my problem – so big that even the British government knew about it,

0:20:22.020,0:20:24.480
it can solve anybody's problem.

0:20:24.480,0:20:26.860
There is no distance for Jesus.

0:20:26.860,0:20:29.100
Jesus is everywhere in this world.

0:20:29.100,0:20:34.800
The Morning Water – minister it very well and have confidence in it.

0:20:34.800,0:20:40.700
My brothers and sisters - it will never let you down, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth

0:20:40.700,0:20:43.060
and the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:20:43.060,0:20:49.400
Amen! One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:20:49.400,0:20:49.900
