I pray You'll be our eyes

0:00:27.440,0:00:34.220
And watch us where we go

0:00:34.220,0:00:41.400

When we lose our way

Lead us to a place

0:07:39.960,0:07:57.280
Let us first recognise our leaders here today from various areas.

0:07:57.280,0:08:01.200
I salute you.

0:08:13.120,0:08:19.220
He who honours a prophet

0:08:19.220,0:08:22.440
because he is a prophet

0:08:22.440,0:08:26.520
receives a prophet's reward.

0:08:26.520,0:08:30.100
Thank you for coming.

0:08:38.600,0:08:44.360
Our Christian leaders

0:08:44.360,0:08:56.400
who have come together to make this revival possible,

0:08:56.400,0:09:03.620
I salute your faith.

0:09:03.620,0:09:07.880
God is our Rewarder.

0:09:07.880,0:09:11.240
Thank you.

0:09:11.240,0:09:14.880
Thank you once again.

Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:09:17.480,0:09:25.400
Here I am, your own boy,

0:09:25.400,0:09:31.200
without fast legs,

0:09:31.200,0:09:37.740
smoothness of tongue,

0:09:37.740,0:09:46.480
or even ability to inspire people.

0:09:46.480,0:09:51.000
I am here in your presence today.

0:09:51.000,0:10:02.220
I say, thank You, Jesus, for having designed and created me.

0:10:02.220,0:10:06.840
Thank you.

0:10:06.840,0:10:10.740
You may be seated, thank you.

0:10:10.740,0:10:21.940
Yes, everything big starts little.

0:10:21.940,0:10:31.900
Don't forget, we were once embryos in our mother's womb.

0:10:31.900,0:10:37.640
See what you have become today.

0:10:37.640,0:10:48.300
I want to believe that today is better, tomorrow - best.

0:10:48.300,0:10:51.080
Thank You, God!

0:10:51.080,0:10:58.060
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:10:58.060,0:11:08.920
Every Christian is a part of Christ's mission.

0:11:08.920,0:11:18.460
Jesus told His disciples in Acts 1

0:11:18.460,0:11:24.040
what can also be applied to us

0:11:24.040,0:11:33.520
that being a missionary is not an option;

0:11:33.520,0:11:41.040
it is what we are called to be.

0:11:41.040,0:11:44.040
Thank You, Jesus!

0:11:44.040,0:11:53.180
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:11:53.180,0:11:57.980
I want to ask you a question.

0:11:57.980,0:12:03.440
What would you do with Jesus

0:12:03.440,0:12:10.160
as He is still standing on trial?

0:12:10.160,0:12:15.040
What would you do with Jesus?

0:12:15.040,0:12:18.700
Ask you neighbour.

0:12:18.700,0:12:22.920
What would you do with Jesus

0:12:22.920,0:12:30.360
as He is still standing on trial?

0:12:30.360,0:12:34.100
If you say that you are a Christian,

0:12:34.100,0:12:39.160
are you practising Christianity?

0:12:39.160,0:12:44.580
What would you do with Jesus?

0:12:44.580,0:12:56.640
Don't forget that to know Jesus Christ is to know the truth.

0:12:56.640,0:13:00.900
Jesus is the truth.

0:13:00.900,0:13:10.180
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:13:10.180,0:13:16.940
Before we start our message today,

0:13:16.940,0:13:21.340
let me get you prepared.

0:13:21.340,0:13:32.980
In order to learn how to serve Jesus in truth and faith,

0:13:32.980,0:13:41.760
there are three habits you must learn.

0:13:41.760,0:13:45.220
I repeat again.

0:13:45.220,0:13:55.300
In order to learn how to serve Jesus in truth,

0:13:55.300,0:14:02.720
there are three habits you must learn.

0:14:02.720,0:14:11.300
I call it "habit" because habit is a gift;

0:14:11.300,0:14:15.040
it's a gift of God.

0:14:15.040,0:14:22.640
There are three habits you must learn.

0:14:22.640,0:14:48.060
1. Talk to God every day.

0:14:48.060,0:14:58.220
Have you talked to God before coming here today?

0:14:58.220,0:15:11.500
2. Let God talk to you every day.

0:15:11.500,0:15:18.100
If you talk to Him, He must talk to you.

0:15:18.100,0:15:29.120
If you talk to Him in Spirit and truth, He must talk to you.

0:15:29.120,0:15:43.500
When you talk to Him and He does not talk to you, it means, you are talking to yourself.

0:15:43.500,0:15:57.940
3. Talk to someone else every day about God.

0:15:57.940,0:16:06.180
How many people have you talked to today about Jesus?

0:16:06.180,0:16:07.900
How many?

0:16:07.900,0:16:11.500
Ask your neighbour.

0:16:11.500,0:16:16.340
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:16:16.340,0:16:23.720
How many people have you talked to today about Jesus?

0:16:23.720,0:16:26.600
He died for you,

0:16:26.600,0:16:28.700
He reigns in power for you

0:16:28.700,0:16:32.900
and He is still praying for you.

0:16:32.900,0:16:38.400
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:16:38.400,0:16:41.980
Don't forget.

0:16:41.980,0:17:02.960
We live in a two language world.

0:17:02.960,0:17:09.240
One - the language of the Bible

0:17:09.240,0:17:29.380
that God uses to heal, bless, create, save, judge, and rule over us.

0:17:29.380,0:17:41.540
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:17:41.540,0:18:01.640
Two - the everyday language,

0:18:01.640,0:18:09.520
this is the language that we use to gossip,

0:18:09.520,0:18:16.460
the language we use to tell stories,

0:18:16.460,0:18:22.440
the language we use to do business,

0:18:22.440,0:18:31.660
the language we use to play today's politics

0:18:31.660,0:18:45.180
and the language we use to talk to our children: "Leave the place! Don't be silly!"

0:18:45.180,0:19:02.600
Such language cannot be used to talk to God and to talk to someone else about God.

0:19:02.600,0:19:07.820
This is the language we use today.

0:19:07.820,0:19:12.200
That is why God cannot hear us.

0:19:12.200,0:19:17.580
That is why you cannot hear from God.

0:19:17.580,0:19:20.680
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:19:20.680,0:19:31.360
We call it "everyday language"

0:19:31.360,0:19:36.600
we use to gossip,

0:19:36.600,0:19:41.000
to tell stories,

0:19:41.000,0:19:45.160
to sing songs,

0:19:45.160,0:19:48.800
to give directions,

0:19:48.800,0:19:52.380
to do business,

0:19:52.380,0:19:58.580
to play today's politics.

0:19:58.580,0:20:13.020
This is why after the politics, whatever we promise, we may likely not do it.

0:20:13.020,0:20:24.080
After the campaign, whatever we promise, we may likely not carry it out.

0:20:24.080,0:20:43.100
Such language cannot be used to talk to God or to talk to someone else about God.

0:20:43.100,0:20:56.100
You cannot use such language to pray, "Jesus! Jesus! Amen! Amen!"

0:20:56.100,0:21:08.760
You cannot use such language to preach, to teach the Word of God or to counsel.

0:21:08.760,0:21:15.640
These are the critical challenges

0:21:15.640,0:21:26.660
we have in Christendom today.

0:21:26.660,0:21:36.800
This will lead us to "The Integrity Of The Word".

0:21:36.800,0:21:50.660
So let me take my Bible to the Book of John 6.

0:21:50.660,0:21:58.940
I will quickly take you to the verse 63.

0:21:58.940,0:22:04.440
"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.

0:22:04.440,0:22:11.540
The Words I have spoken to you - they are full of the Spirit and life."

0:22:11.540,0:22:26.920
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:22:26.920,0:22:30.920
Jesus says:

0:22:30.920,0:22:44.020
"The Words I spoke to you are Spirit and life".

0:22:44.020,0:22:51.660
Spirit - life.

0:22:51.660,0:23:00.500
Don't forget: The Integrity Of The Word.

0:23:00.500,0:23:28.060
This means, the Word is not complete without the Spirit

0:23:28.060,0:23:39.540
and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.

0:23:39.540,0:23:47.560
The Spirit enlightens the Word.

0:23:47.560,0:23:58.500
Without the Spirit, the Word will remain inactive.

0:23:58.500,0:24:11.080
Without the Spirit, the Word will remain everyday language.

0:24:11.080,0:24:17.440
Everyday language is the language we use to gossip, tell stories, sing songs,

0:24:17.440,0:24:20.820
to give direction and to do business.

0:24:20.820,0:24:34.400
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:24:34.400,0:24:50.160
Without the Spirit, the Word will remain everyday language.

0:24:50.160,0:25:09.160
That is, without the Spirit, the Word will remain without being.

0:25:09.160,0:25:17.800
Oftentimes, it is destructive.

0:25:17.800,0:25:25.560
This was what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.

0:25:25.560,0:25:37.880
Without the Spirit, the Word remains idle, lifeless.

0:25:37.880,0:25:45.000
The Spirit lightens the Word.

0:25:45.000,0:26:02.820
This is what Jesus meant when He said, "The Words I spoke to you are Spirit and life".

0:26:02.820,0:26:07.740
Without the Spirit, when you say, "Jesus", you are talking of yourself

0:26:07.740,0:26:10.880
or calling someone who is bearing the name 'Jesus'.

0:26:10.880,0:26:22.020
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:26:22.020,0:26:27.580
You know, people bear the name 'Jesus'.

0:26:27.580,0:26:36.900
I know many people who say, "My name is Jesus".

0:26:36.900,0:26:40.360
Without the Spirit, when you say "Jesus",

0:26:40.360,0:26:46.460
you are calling someone bearing "Jesus", not Jesus of Nazareth.

0:26:46.460,0:27:03.580
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:27:03.580,0:27:25.900
God and His Word are one.

0:27:25.900,0:27:36.460
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:27:36.460,0:27:45.140
Don't forget, God is Spirit.

0:27:45.140,0:28:05.580
If it is not in the Spirit, it is not in the truth. So, it is all nothing.

0:28:05.580,0:28:17.760
I repeat again. God and His Word are one.

0:28:17.760,0:28:24.700
Don't forget that God is Spirit.

0:28:24.700,0:28:35.580
And His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and truth.

0:28:35.580,0:28:44.760
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:28:44.760,0:29:10.620
If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth, and so, it is all nothing.

0:29:10.620,0:29:27.660
The Word is God speaking to you.

0:29:27.660,0:29:39.040
Which means, the Word is the Word of God.

0:29:39.040,0:29:49.520
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

0:29:49.520,0:30:17.160
"Thus says Jehovah" is repeated 2,000 times from Exodus to Deuteronomy.

0:30:17.160,0:30:25.180
The Word is always now.

0:30:25.180,0:30:41.500
Now!

0:30:41.500,0:30:45.140
Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1

Before we come to the end of this message,

0:30:53.880,0:31:06.720
let's look at the Book of Colossians 3:10.

0:31:06.720,0:31:13.260
"...and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge

0:31:13.260,0:31:16.820
in the image of its Creator."

0:31:31.280,0:31:49.640
The heart is renewed by studying the Word

0:31:49.640,0:31:56.620
and by acting upon the Word.

0:31:56.620,0:31:59.020
Take note.

0:31:59.020,0:32:17.400
It is not renewed by studying alone but by studying and acting upon the Word.

0:32:17.400,0:32:28.600
One may study the Word of God for years

0:32:28.600,0:32:40.760
but if he does not act on it, live by it and practice it,

0:32:40.760,0:32:46.440
he is not the doer of the Word

0:32:46.440,0:32:53.680
and the heart is not renewed.

0:32:53.680,0:32:58.900
Going by what we have learned today,

0:32:58.900,0:33:04.000
the sick ones can only be healed and delivered

0:33:04.000,0:33:07.420
by looking into the Word

0:33:18.040,0:33:26.600
and by acting upon the Word,

0:33:26.600,0:33:33.200
you bring Jesus into the scene

0:33:33.200,0:33:36.940
to heal,

0:33:36.940,0:33:39.120
to deliver,

0:33:39.120,0:33:41.200
to bless,

0:33:41.200,0:33:43.600
to set free,

0:33:43.600,0:33:47.600
instantly!

0:33:57.480,0:34:05.000
By looking into the Word and by acting upon the Word,

0:34:05.000,0:34:12.860
we bring Jesus into the scene to heal, bless and set free.
