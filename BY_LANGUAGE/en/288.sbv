The light of God fell upon this man.

0:00:32.860,0:00:36.640
And began to wrestle his soul free from
 the clutches of darkness.

0:00:37.000,0:00:40.580

Who are you?)

0:00:52.240,0:00:54.200
I am marine spirit.

0:00:54.540,0:00:56.540
(How many are you in this body?)

0:00:56.540,0:00:57.380
We are many.

0:00:57.380,0:00:58.580
(Who is the second person?)

0:00:58.580,0:00:59.860
'Ogboni' cult.

0:00:59.860,0:01:01.360
(What have you done to him?)

0:01:02.040,0:01:04.040
I have destroyed him.

0:01:04.380,0:01:07.500
(How far have you gone? 
what have you done to his career?
what do you do for a living?)

0:01:09.100,0:01:11.100
He is in entertainment.

0:01:11.100,0:01:12.900
What have you done to his career?

0:01:13.020,0:01:14.180
I have destroyed it.

0:01:14.180,0:01:16.420
I don't want him to succeed in anything he does.

0:01:17.600,0:01:19.600
(How far have you gone in destroying his career as a man?)

0:01:21.620,0:01:23.620
We will destroy anything he lay his hand upon.

0:01:25.180,0:01:27.180

0:01:27.240,0:01:27.840
Yes.

0:01:27.840,0:01:29.840
(What have you done to his marital life?)

0:01:31.020,0:01:32.360
We have given him the spirit of lust.

0:01:32.360,0:01:33.740
(How has the spirit of lust affected him?)

0:01:35.720,0:01:38.340
He uses his eyes to see women; 
he sleeps with very woman he sees.

0:01:38.900,0:01:42.020
A lot of women.

0:01:42.020,0:01:44.720
(What happen to those women - their career

0:01:45.160,0:01:49.040
As soon I sleep with them, anything he does fails.

0:01:49.340,0:01:51.520
(Does it mean those women are your agents?)

0:01:52.020,0:01:55.080
Yes, anything he does fails.

0:01:55.980,0:01:59.080
(Listen to me, You send those to women to him?)

0:01:59.760,0:02:02.400
Yes, to destroy him.

0:02:03.020,0:02:04.920
(How has the spirit of anger affected him?)

0:02:04.920,0:02:05.420
A lot.

0:02:06.240,0:02:06.740
(How?)

0:02:08.260,0:02:12.680
He is very stubborn, he fights
 anybody that cross his way.

0:02:12.960,0:02:14.960
(You make him fight any 
body that crosses his way?

0:02:15.300,0:02:16.880
And when you fight what 
happens to this people?)

0:02:18.180,0:02:23.340
Before he knows it, he finds himself where he doesn't expect to be.

0:02:24.060,0:02:27.220
(Can you give instances of places he finds himself after fighting?)

0:02:27.620,0:02:29.920
He fights policemen everyday in Ghana

0:02:30.060,0:02:30.880
if he is driving.

0:02:32.760,0:02:35.080
Nobody can come to him, anywhere.

0:02:35.860,0:02:37.860
(What would happen to him at the end of the day?)

0:02:38.160,0:02:41.760
He will end up spending all his 
money where he is not supposed to spend.

0:02:42.300,0:02:43.720
On things that are not necessary.

0:02:44.200,0:02:45.760
(what have you done to his family?)

0:02:48.440,0:02:49.900
He is supposed to be the pillar of his family

0:02:49.900,0:02:51.220
he is a great person.

0:02:53.720,0:02:55.800
(Look here!

0:02:56.200,0:02:58.200
Open your eyes.

0:02:59.820,0:03:01.820
Thank you Lord in Jesus name.

0:03:07.560,0:03:09.560
Thank you Lord you are free!

0:03:16.500,0:03:18.500
How are you?}

0:03:18.500,0:03:20.340
I am fine.

0:03:21.140,0:03:23.140
(What happened to you?)

0:03:25.880,0:03:27.880
I am dirty,

0:03:28.560,0:03:30.560
(Why?)

0:03:30.560,0:03:32.560
I don't know.

0:03:33.520,0:03:35.520
I sat here.

0:03:35.780,0:03:36.860
(You were standing there?)

0:03:37.020,0:03:37.520
Yes

0:03:37.520,0:03:39.520
(Who pushed you down? 
you just stood from the floor)

0:03:41.600,0:03:42.720
Thank you Jesus!

0:03:46.120,0:03:49.120
Emmanuel!

0:03:49.420,0:03:51.420
Thank you Jesus!

0:03:52.420,0:03:54.420
My name is Chris Paul Abure.

0:03:55.160,0:03:57.160
I am a Nigerian living in Ghana.

0:03:58.180,0:04:00.180
By my right here is my mum.

0:04:00.940,0:04:02.940
beside my mum is her sister.

0:04:03.100,0:04:05.100
Those are my two younger sisters.

0:04:05.420,0:04:08.580
I am a professional model:
 I am a model by profession

0:04:08.920,0:04:10.920
I am here to that God for what He has done in my life.

0:04:11.740,0:04:14.540
It all happened 16 years ago.

0:04:16.260,0:04:19.500
I didn't know what I did to my dad, I offended him.

0:04:19.760,0:04:22.420
He called me in a room for one on one,

0:04:22.580,0:04:25.460
and he removed his clothes and cursed me.

0:04:26.360,0:04:29.500
He said to me that I will never prosper in anything I do.

0:04:29.540,0:04:32.960
I did find it funny then, i thought maybe he was joking.

0:04:33.040,0:04:34.440
I didn't take it serious.

0:04:34.780,0:04:36.560
I started acting funny since then

0:04:36.560,0:04:38.060
I was no longer stayed at home,

0:04:38.300,0:04:40.160
I started doing things I wasn't supposed to do.

0:04:40.360,0:04:42.900
I found my self smoking, I smoked a lot.

0:04:43.220,0:04:45.240
I used to dink and womanize.

0:04:45.660,0:04:48.980
I found myself doing things that were funny , I don't know.

0:04:49.260,0:04:53.040
One day, I felt like smoking; there was a spirit pushing me.

0:04:53.100,0:04:54.860
to go to the beach to smoke.

0:04:55.220,0:04:57.220
So I went to the beach and started smoking.

0:04:57.280,0:05:00.260
I was sitting on the beach alone smoking.

0:05:00.740,0:05:02.740
There was nobody in the beach, the place was quiet

0:05:03.280,0:05:05.960
that day was not a beach day that people come around.

0:05:06.060,0:05:11.220
As I was smoking, before I knew I just saw a beautiful coming from behind me.

0:05:11.880,0:05:13.880
And she tapped me on my back.

0:05:13.980,0:05:15.980
She said, "Handsome, how are you doing?"

0:05:15.980,0:05:17.060
I said, "Yeah, I am good."

0:05:17.060,0:05:18.800
Before I knew she joined me.

0:05:18.800,0:05:20.360
She started asking me what was my name.

0:05:20.820,0:05:22.500
Before she asked me what is my name,

0:05:22.780,0:05:24.820
we started kissing each other.

0:05:25.840,0:05:27.080
I didn't know her before.

0:05:27.500,0:05:29.660
We started kissing and enjoying what was happening.

0:05:29.660,0:05:30.860
Because she was very beautiful

0:05:31.960,0:05:33.960
{You mean this happened physically or in the dream?}

0:05:33.960,0:05:35.840
It was not in the dream, It was physical.

0:05:36.240,0:05:39.020
She told me that we should take a walk.

0:05:39.020,0:05:41.240
I said, "I don't feel like, I'm okay where 
I am right now."

0:05:41.240,0:05:42.820
I told here, If she wants to sit, she should sit.

0:05:43.040,0:05:44.100
If she doesnt feel like sitting, she should leave.

0:05:44.300,0:05:46.800
The next thing, as soon as I used that word

0:05:46.800,0:05:50.120
that I didn't feel like walking that
 I was okay were I was.

0:05:50.400,0:05:52.620
The beach water was very far from me,

0:05:52.760,0:05:57.200
Before I uttered that word, the next 
thing I saw was water in front of me.

0:05:59.480,0:06:01.480
I said, "Ah, what is this?"

0:06:01.480,0:06:02.980
The girl asked, "Whats wrong with you?"

0:06:03.180,0:06:05.180
She said that very soon she will 
take me to where I belong.

0:06:06.280,0:06:08.280
As soon as she said that she will take me where I belong,

0:06:08.460,0:06:10.460
I asked her, "Where did I belong?"

0:06:11.600,0:06:13.100
I said, "I bind you in Jesus name"

0:06:13.100,0:06:13.900
but I was smoking.

0:06:14.320,0:06:16.920
I said, "I bind you in Jesus name."

0:06:17.260,0:06:19.980
Above everything, I believe in God.

0:06:20.540,0:06:23.020
But I couldnt stop my lifestyle.

0:06:23.760,0:06:25.500
I smoked alot and womanised

0:06:28.280,0:06:30.080
If I set my eyes on any girl,

0:06:30.080,0:06:32.120
unless I don't want her, she couldn't escape,

0:06:32.140,0:06:33.160
I must get her down.

0:06:33.600,0:06:36.620
I slept with every girl that came close to me.

0:06:36.720,0:06:39.480
I slept with a lot- I cant even count.

0:06:39.480,0:06:40.820
But I thank God for today.

0:06:41.400,0:06:45.080
{So that demon spirit, 
affected you with the demon of what?}

0:06:45.340,0:06:47.340
Lust and anger

0:06:47.360,0:06:48.940
{Okay continue.}

0:06:48.940,0:06:53.120
These big things happened three
 times in my life

0:06:53.520,0:06:55.080
and in three different countries.

0:06:55.520,0:07:00.140
It happened here in Nigeria,
 in Seirra Leone and in Ghana

0:07:01.260,0:07:04.120
{So each time you are sitting at the beach,

0:07:04.120,0:07:07.080
a strange lady would just come to you?}

0:07:07.080,0:07:09.300
She just walked down to me  and we would start kissing.

0:07:09.560,0:07:11.560
But the last one, I didnt kiss her

0:07:12.120,0:07:14.120
the last one in Ghana, I didnt kiss her.

0:07:14.560,0:07:16.560
I said, "I know who you are."

0:07:16.560,0:07:18.380
I told her to leave me, I knew who she was.

0:07:19.040,0:07:21.840
And she said, "That she will get me."

0:07:23.940,0:07:26.900
There was a day in 2011 I was having a show

0:07:27.580,0:07:31.060
After the show, the girl just walked down to me

0:07:31.220,0:07:32.600
and called me by my name actually.

0:07:33.440,0:07:35.640
' Chris' and by my sir name ,Abure' and

0:07:36.340,0:07:38.880
I was wondering how she knew my sir name,

0:07:39.620,0:07:41.620
I haven't put my sir name on Facebook.

0:07:41.620,0:07:43.240
People knew me with the name' Chris'

0:07:43.380,0:07:45.380
and I put my other name which is 'Abolume'

0:07:46.580,0:07:48.580
I asked her, "How do you know my name?"

0:07:49.200,0:07:51.200
But I didn't mind because the girl was beautiful.

0:07:52.080,0:07:54.080
I just took her to the house,

0:07:54.600,0:07:58.300
When I took her in my house, just about to do anything

0:07:58.940,0:08:01.360
Something came in me and I said, "Thank you Jesus."

0:08:01.780,0:08:03.360
I don't know what happened, I cant remember

0:08:03.480,0:08:05.460
All i remember is I just said, Thank you Jesus!"

0:08:05.840,0:08:08.980
Before ending the thing, the girl said, "Leave me, leave me,"

0:08:08.980,0:08:10.540
She wanted to go, she was packing her things.

0:08:10.940,0:08:13.300
I said, "Where are you going? lets finished what we started."

0:08:14.020,0:08:16.980
She was saying, "No don't touch me., there is fire "

0:08:16.980,0:08:18.980
She was running from me.

0:08:19.720,0:08:22.120
She told me, "You are lucky, you are lucky!"

0:08:22.440,0:08:25.380
I asked her, "What do you mean by I am lucky, 
what did you want to do to me?"

0:08:25.800,0:08:30.300
I started threatening her saying, 
""you cannot do anything to me."

0:08:31.360,0:08:34.040
{So we can see some pictures there, can you explain the pictures?}

0:08:34.040,0:08:35.340
Those are my pictures,

0:08:35.760,0:08:38.700
I have done a couple of shows - commercial.

0:08:38.960,0:08:42.720
Sometimes when I do shows, I get angry with everybody.

0:08:43.000,0:08:46.240
Nobody could talk to me.

0:08:46.660,0:08:49.680
If anybody got in my way, I could fight them.

0:08:50.200,0:08:53.760
The spirit of anger made me in a way - 
sometimes I could find myself in prison.

0:08:54.220,0:08:58.540
I could be drinking beer and someone makes me angry

0:08:58.540,0:09:01.720
I would just break the bottle and stub the person.

0:09:02.080,0:09:05.160
I have spent three weeks in prison in Burkina Faso

0:09:05.400,0:09:07.400
In a foreign country.

0:09:07.440,0:09:11.740
I have been in prison in Guinea, Conakry and Mali.

0:09:11.740,0:09:13.620
At the end of the day, they would just leave me there

0:09:13.620,0:09:15.360
because I don't have the money to bail me out.

0:09:15.360,0:09:16.700
But I still found myself doing the same thing.

0:09:17.140,0:09:19.480
I knew I had a problem, but I didn't know the way out.

0:09:19.780,0:09:21.780
{And how did this affect your job?}

0:09:22.300,0:09:23.700
It affected me a lot.

0:09:23.700,0:09:28.960
Sometimes if I go to the designers - boss, maybe they have a job for me,

0:09:28.960,0:09:30.900
as soon I get to them, they would tell me that

0:09:30.900,0:09:33.480
they have given the job to someone else already that deserves the job,

0:09:33.480,0:09:34.740
better than me.

0:09:37.020,0:09:38.280
Sometimes I would go to auditions, and they would pick me

0:09:38.280,0:09:40.280
that I would be doing the commercial, maybe is a big one.

0:09:40.440,0:09:42.440
and I am playing the key role.

0:09:42.840,0:09:47.280
As soon I get the job and everything is confirmed that I would do the job

0:09:47.380,0:09:51.700
the next morning they would change their minds.

0:09:52.240,0:09:54.240
I really have a lot of bad dreams.

0:09:54.780,0:09:58.140
Sometimes If I didn't sleep with a girl on that particular night,

0:09:58.540,0:10:01.260
I would dream having sex with that particular girl in the dream.

0:10:02.720,0:10:06.360
Sometimes I would me dreaming and see myself in my old school.

0:10:06.460,0:10:09.280
All those kinds of funny dreams, my old house.

0:10:09.800,0:10:12.180
I usually dream those kind of dreams alot.

0:10:12.660,0:10:16.780
{Okay, tell us, what effort did you find
 to get a solution to your problem

0:10:16.920,0:10:20.380
before you eventually come to SCOAN?}

0:10:20.920,0:10:24.040
I have been in lot of places, I have been
 in spiritual houses

0:10:25.080,0:10:27.080
from far, in find of a solution.

0:10:27.700,0:10:31.120
Because I knew I had a problem,
I saw myself not moving forward.

0:10:31.540,0:10:35.040
There are a lot of people that started with me 
and they are very far unlike me.

0:10:35.360,0:10:39.120
And because of that i searched for solution, 
but it was zero.

0:10:39.620,0:10:42.980
{So how did you come to know about SCOAN?}

0:10:42.980,0:10:44.980
It all happened last year.

0:10:45.360,0:10:49.620
Actually I will not lie to you, I did not believe in Prophet TB Joshua before.

0:10:51.940,0:10:54.040
But it happened last year,

0:10:54.040,0:10:56.020
I usually saw what the Man of God was doing on TV.

0:10:56.200,0:10:59.360
I started watching, sometimes i would come across him preaching on TV.

0:10:59.380,0:11:01.200
doing healings and all this kinds of things

0:11:01.200,0:11:02.740
I watched the miracles.

0:11:03.100,0:11:08.160
One day in the office, my elder brother; all of them have anointed water

0:11:08.780,0:11:11.360
He gave me anointed water and I took some,

0:11:11.360,0:11:14.720
and I felt some funny movement inside my body.

0:11:14.720,0:11:19.220
I felt funny way in my body, I didn't know what was happening.

0:11:19.880,0:11:21.320
That night was on a Thursday,

0:11:21.480,0:11:24.800
Thursday in Ghana happens to be a reggae day in some places.

0:11:25.360,0:11:26.960
I went there.

0:11:28.100,0:11:31.780
I usually go to smoke before I could go and do my performances.

0:11:31.780,0:11:34.740
As I was about to smoke, I couldn't feel the smoke anymore

0:11:34.740,0:11:36.540
I didnt feel like smoking

0:11:37.460,0:11:40.057
It happened like that, and that is how since the middle

0:11:40.060,0:11:41.520
of last year i stopped smoking.

0:11:46.300,0:11:51.120
{So you mean after your elder brother gave you the anointed water,

0:11:51.540,0:11:54.700
and you took the anointed water and ministered to yourself

0:11:55.100,0:11:58.920
the urge to smoke disappeared?}

0:11:58.920,0:11:59.780
Yes exactly!

0:12:00.360,0:12:03.780
{Tell us, you were telling us a while ago about the experience

0:12:03.780,0:12:06.520
you used to have at the beach side.

0:12:06.640,0:12:10.120
A strange lady would just walk at you each time at the the side of the beach

0:12:10.640,0:12:13.640
what happened to you in your career, in your life?}

0:12:14.280,0:12:17.155
It happened that If I was going anywhere,

0:12:17.155,0:12:19.820
I didn't prosper in anything that I did

0:12:20.080,0:12:22.080
If I met anyone - it was failure.

0:12:22.800,0:12:25.320
The good things that I was supposed to get, they wouldn't get.

0:12:25.320,0:12:28.300
They would be giving me the lower ones which i was not okay with it.

0:12:28.300,0:12:29.500
I knew I had a problem.

0:12:30.100,0:12:33.880
{So tell us, since you came to SCOAN what happened?}

0:12:34.420,0:12:37.940
It happened two weeks ago, i dreamt  for the first time in my dream,

0:12:37.940,0:12:41.420
seeing Prophet TB Joshua delivering me in the dream

0:12:41.860,0:12:45.680
I woke up and wondered, "This man of God delivering me in the dream?"

0:12:46.200,0:12:48.700
That means I am delivered from my problems.

0:12:48.820,0:12:54.100
I told my elder brother, "I dreamt the Man of God delivering me in my dream."

0:12:54.160,0:12:58.060
He said, "you still need to go, you still need deliverance."

0:12:58.760,0:13:01.660
That is how I found my way to the church.

0:13:02.440,0:13:03.980
{And could you remember anything that happened

0:13:04.480,0:13:08.540
when the wise men were moving around, what happened?}

0:13:09.100,0:13:14.760
I didn't know what happened I just found myself on the floor.

0:13:14.760,0:13:16.760
they said, I say something.

0:13:17.800,0:13:20.460
{They said, you say something?}

0:13:20.460,0:13:21.340
No

0:13:21.340,0:13:25.160
{And after the deliverance tell us how you felt

0:13:25.160,0:13:28.880
immediately  and since then, tell us your condition now?}

0:13:29.180,0:13:33.560
Since then I am a different person now, I don't feel the way i used to.

0:13:33.780,0:13:37.100
Because before when i was sitting alone I could think evil.

0:13:37.620,0:13:42.000
Nothing but evil, I would be thinking of how i would bring evil to people.

0:13:42.400,0:13:44.920
the is the only thing that could come into my mind.

0:13:45.060,0:13:46.060
something evil - bad things.

0:13:46.760,0:13:50.220
And since the deliverance I don't thing anymore.

0:13:50.220,0:13:51.320
{And the anger?}

0:13:51.840,0:13:56.460
The spirit of anger - Even if you slap me right now, I wouldn't return it.

0:13:56.460,0:13:57.440
{You just say thank you!}

0:13:57.440,0:13:58.940
I would say thank you!

0:13:58.940,0:14:00.920
{Hallelujah, lets put our hands together for Jesus!}

0:14:05.920,0:14:09.520
{And the spirit of lust that has ruled and ruin your life,

0:14:09.820,0:14:11.460
tell us, since after you deliverance?}

0:14:11.700,0:14:17.020
Since then I don't feel anything, for any girl anymore - minus my wife.

0:14:17.260,0:14:18.260
{You don't see any other?}

0:14:18.300,0:14:20.020
Any other, even if she is beautiful.

0:14:20.360,0:14:23.500
{Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, Let us clap for Jesus Christ!}

0:14:27.480,0:14:29.480
My name is Mrs Abure

0:14:30.140,0:14:32.140
The one beside me is my son.

0:14:32.660,0:14:34.660
This woman is my younger sister.

0:14:35.440,0:14:37.440
Those two girls are my daughters.

0:14:37.820,0:14:40.000
I just want to thank God

0:14:40.080,0:14:43.440
because since my son called me,

0:14:44.080,0:14:47.960
He called me a day before the day we came to SCOAN.

0:14:48.820,0:14:52.740
He said, "Mummy I am coming to Nigeria for a program."

0:14:53.300,0:14:56.580
I was happy and said, "Okay pray for us."

0:14:56.800,0:15:00.240
He called me and told me that they have delivered him

0:15:00.460,0:15:02.300
we even saw him on the Emmanuel television live stream.

0:15:02.440,0:15:07.660
Because my son, his elder brother, when he came from Nigeria,

0:15:07.660,0:15:11.740
he said to me, "Mummy you dont have Emmanuel TV."

0:15:11.740,0:15:12.740
I said, "no!"

0:15:13.040,0:15:17.340
He paid money and they came and installed TV for me.

0:15:17.340,0:15:20.480
Since then, I have been watching, till day break.

0:15:20.500,0:15:22.500
24 hours a day - used to put it on.

0:15:23.260,0:15:26.680
My son called me saying, "Christopher is manifesting."

0:15:26.680,0:15:29.020
I asked, "Ah, my son is manifesting?"

0:15:29.460,0:15:31.640
We turned on Emmanuel TV.

0:15:31.840,0:15:35.640
At night we called him after delivering him.

0:15:35.640,0:15:38.160
He said, "Yes I have been delivered."

0:15:38.620,0:15:44.140
Previously, he was very stubborn, when his elder brother came from Nigeria,

0:15:44.220,0:15:47.780
he reported to me that no body could talk to him.

0:15:48.020,0:15:52.280
That the life he was living was a wayward life.

0:15:52.700,0:15:55.420
When you talk to him he was ready to fight that person.

0:15:55.440,0:15:57.820
He is ready to break the bottle and stub that person

0:15:57.980,0:16:00.820
Since he was delivered, I was very happy.

0:16:01.160,0:16:03.960
I am the happiest woman in the while world.

0:16:04.400,0:16:06.400
{Let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:16:07.700,0:16:11.940
That says it all, 'mama' says that she is the happiest woman in the world today.

0:16:12.400,0:16:17.500
Since her son complitly delivered from his past ways of life.

0:16:17.620,0:16:20.960
That gives her peace, joy and comfort.

0:16:21.280,0:16:25.620
we thank God for her life, and can we hear from the aunt?}

0:16:31.020,0:16:32.080
{Tell us your name?}

0:16:32.760,0:16:34.760
My name is Comfort Wiyas

0:16:35.140,0:16:37.140
I thank God for his life.

0:16:37.600,0:16:39.280
We are all happy.

0:16:39.760,0:16:41.760
Thank you Jesus! Emmanuel!

0:16:42.640,0:16:43.900
{We are happy with you,

0:16:43.900,0:16:45.320
Let us clap for Jesus one more time!}

0:16:47.600,0:16:49.580
{With what the Lord has done in your life,

0:16:49.580,0:16:51.980
you have come a long way through life.

0:16:52.480,0:16:55.600
Now what kind of advice or encouragement

0:16:55.600,0:16:57.580
do you have to the people who are listening to your testimony

0:16:58.060,0:17:02.660
and also to the people who are in the same profession as you.

0:17:02.780,0:17:06.240
knowing the kind of life that they live outside there.

0:17:06.240,0:17:10.020
Now that you have seen the light,
 what word of advice do you have for them?}

0:17:10.360,0:17:12.640
I know that there is a lot of people watching me right now.

0:17:12.760,0:17:16.160
My advice to them is that you should stick to Gods Word.

0:17:16.620,0:17:18.200
He will never fail them.

0:17:18.480,0:17:22.080
If you can listen to my story and see all  I have passed through

0:17:22.180,0:17:22.820
It was not easy

0:17:23.160,0:17:26.060
Sometimes you may see yourself doing some funny things,

0:17:26.380,0:17:31.200
you would think that its fun, or enjoyment, or see your

0:17:31.200,0:17:33.520
self being with some pretty girls and smoking.

0:17:34.220,0:17:36.220
Those things are demonic.

0:17:36.460,0:17:38.460
Its not the real you doing those things.

0:17:38.740,0:17:41.280
So you need to be delivered, all you need is your freedom.

0:17:41.620,0:17:44.160
If you are not delivered, there is nothing that will be working well.

0:17:44.660,0:17:46.320
Things maybe working well for you right now,

0:17:46.320,0:17:48.560
and you may think maybe its by grace.

0:17:48.740,0:17:50.980
But all you need right now is to seek the face of God.

0:17:51.340,0:17:54.680
And if you do that, you life will never remain the same again.

0:17:54.820,0:17:55.320
Amen.

0:17:55.640,0:17:57.640
{Thank you very much, lets clap for Jesus!

0:17:58.640,0:18:00.640
wonderful advice, thank you.}
