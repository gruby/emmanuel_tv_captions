Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:00:03.640,0:00:08.480
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:08.480,0:00:11.280
I want to believe we are here to sow to the Spirit.

0:00:11.280,0:00:12.440
Amen!

0:00:12.440,0:00:13.660
I cannot hear you.

0:00:13.660,0:00:15.260
Amen!

0:00:15.260,0:00:22.080
Each time we listen to the Word of God, there is a passage there that I love so much.

0:00:22.080,0:00:27.040
“You are already cleansed because of the Word which I have spoken to you.” John 15:3

0:00:27.040,0:00:31.780
After listening to the Word of God, can we say, "You are free"?

0:00:31.780,0:00:34.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:34.980,0:00:40.400
When you are still living in the past, you are taking journeys to yesterday.

0:00:40.400,0:00:50.500
The Word of God helps us to stop reliving the past in our present life.

0:00:50.500,0:01:00.480
Tell your neighbour, “The Word of God helps us to stop reliving...”

0:01:00.480,0:01:08.020
You know what I mean by reliving - the past in our present life.

0:01:08.020,0:01:17.260
When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.

0:01:17.260,0:01:19.500
That is when you know you are already free.

0:01:19.500,0:01:27.000
When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern

0:01:27.000,0:01:31.760
or your behaviours.

0:01:31.760,0:01:40.060
"Yes. How will I pay my school fees? How will I pay my house rent? I'm sick. Somebody sick is in the hospital.

0:01:40.060,0:01:46.580
What is going to happen? How will I get...? I don't know whether I will be paid my salary.

0:01:46.580,0:01:49.160
I don't know what will happen here."

0:01:49.160,0:01:57.900
When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.

0:01:57.900,0:02:00.280
I mean, your behaviours.

0:02:00.280,0:02:03.300
Wherever you are coming from, whatever you have gone through

0:02:03.300,0:02:07.100
before coming here does not matter.

0:02:07.100,0:02:09.780
This is what the Bible means by,

0:02:09.780,0:02:16.660
“You are already cleansed because of the Word I have spoken to you”.

0:02:16.660,0:02:18.180
Are you with me?

0:02:18.180,0:02:19.420
Tell your neighbour,

0:02:19.420,0:02:30.620
“When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.”

0:02:30.620,0:02:32.760
I mean, your behaviours.

0:02:32.760,0:02:38.500
You know, before you came here today, you were so worried, you were thinking how to do this or that,

0:02:38.500,0:02:42.440
"How will I do it? How will I go about it?",

0:02:42.440,0:02:45.480
but after receiving the Word of God you start laughing.

0:02:45.480,0:02:51.860
The pain may be there but yet, the joy has overcome over the shadow.

0:02:51.860,0:02:54.760
You can have the pain and at the same time be happy.

0:02:54.760,0:03:01.240
Tell your neighbour, “You can have the pain and at the same time be happy”

0:03:01.240,0:03:06.480
because the part that has pain is not yours; it’s not part of you.

0:03:06.480,0:03:14.220
The part that has that pain is not part of you; it’s a shade.

0:03:14.220,0:03:19.560
A cover - you know the snake; snake enters the shade.

0:03:19.560,0:03:23.600
The Lord never consults your past to determine your future.

0:03:23.600,0:03:25.560
He never says, "Oh!"

0:03:25.560,0:03:30.060
If your past was consulted, you would not be here today.

0:03:30.060,0:03:34.660
A lot of things is out there to stop you from coming.

0:03:34.660,0:03:37.060
When you receive that Word...

0:03:37.060,0:03:42.820
The Word has been delivered - we don't know whether you have received the Word.

0:03:42.820,0:03:50.340
Some receive with their ears and some receive with their heart.

0:03:50.340,0:04:01.120
If you have received the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.

0:04:01.120,0:04:07.360
The way you think, the manner you think...

0:04:07.360,0:04:11.700
I will bind your feet to the path of righteousness today.

0:04:11.700,0:04:16.780
Rise up; let's start that one first, because what I'm saying looks strange to you,

0:04:16.780,0:04:22.080
"What does this man saying? He says I should not think of where I'm coming from?

0:04:22.080,0:04:24.220
I should not think about my debts?"

0:04:24.220,0:04:25.800
That is the position of faith.

0:04:25.800,0:04:30.760
Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised.

0:04:30.760,0:04:38.380
Right now, begin to bind your feet to the path of righteousness; prayer.

0:04:38.380,0:04:46.420
Bind your feet right now to the path of righteousness because you are made righteous.

0:04:46.420,0:04:49.460
You are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

0:04:49.460,0:04:58.480
Begin to bind your feet to the path of righteousness.

0:04:58.480,0:05:01.080
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:05:01.080,0:05:02.620
Amen!

0:05:02.620,0:05:11.040
- I bind you to the work of the Cross.
- Amen.

0:05:11.040,0:05:12.180
I cannot hear you.

0:05:12.180,0:05:14.020
Amen!

0:05:14.020,0:05:18.460
Yes; you are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

0:05:18.460,0:05:20.780
Open your lips and confess this.

0:05:20.780,0:05:24.400
Believe you are bound to the path of righteousness.

0:05:24.400,0:05:26.320
Yes.

0:05:26.320,0:05:39.820
You can say, "No", and say "Yes" with an independent mind, that can think, reason...

0:05:39.820,0:05:42.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:42.860,0:05:46.460
Be bound to the work of the Cross, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:46.460,0:05:48.100
Amen!

0:05:48.100,0:05:51.460
Be bound to the work of the Cross, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:05:51.460,0:05:52.580
Amen!

0:05:52.580,0:05:57.300
With His mercy, forgiveness and love,

0:05:57.300,0:06:00.800
be bound to the work of the Cross, in the name of Jesus!

0:06:00.800,0:06:01.980
Amen!

0:06:01.980,0:06:04.100
Thank You, Lord.
You may be seated.

0:06:04.100,0:06:06.880
Hallelujah.

0:06:06.880,0:06:09.600
Now, you will begin to think differently.

0:06:09.600,0:06:11.420
Begin right now.

0:06:11.420,0:06:17.180
Now you are free, look forward to those things that lie ahead.

0:06:17.180,0:06:19.900
You are to get yourself ready.

0:06:19.900,0:06:24.740
If you have not positioned yourself, God cannot position you.

0:06:24.740,0:06:26.360
Do you listen to me?

0:06:26.360,0:06:31.420
You are to first position yourself for God to position you.

0:06:31.420,0:06:38.120
If you just say, "I'm not interested in what they are talking about", then you have not positioned yourself.

0:06:38.120,0:06:42.600
You are to position yourself for God to position you.

0:06:42.600,0:06:48.020
Believe God is not a man; when He says yes, yes is yes.

0:06:48.020,0:06:51.360
You need to know the power you are under right now.

0:06:51.360,0:07:01.480
You ask yourself, "What power am I under? Am I under man? Am I under T.B. Joshua? Am I under Jesus Christ?"

0:07:01.480,0:07:04.380
You need to know the power you are under.

0:07:04.380,0:07:05.320
The songs says,

0:07:05.320,0:07:08.640
Leave it for God
Don’t worry yourself

0:07:08.640,0:07:12.920
Leave it for God
Don’t cry no more

0:07:12.920,0:07:17.280
Jesus is alive
Praise God

0:07:17.280,0:07:20.660
You can face tomorrow

0:07:20.660,0:07:26.220
He understands
What you are passing through today

0:07:26.220,0:07:28.560
Let God glorify His name

0:07:28.560,0:07:29.660
You listen to that?

0:07:29.660,0:07:34.500
I know this is just a mere song; you sing it every day, "Leave if for God..."

0:07:34.500,0:07:36.540
What are you leaving for God?

0:07:36.540,0:07:40.220
Your worries, your care.

0:07:40.220,0:07:43.360
Are you actually leaving your worries for God?

0:07:43.360,0:07:48.140
We see our faith as a hobby, a game.

0:07:48.140,0:07:56.900
You know; games - we are not serious about games; when it does not go well, we look for another game.

0:07:56.900,0:08:01.500
It is not a hobby; there is no alternative.

0:08:01.500,0:08:03.580
Faith is faith.

0:08:03.580,0:08:08.440
You need to know the difference between your faith and a hobby.

0:08:08.440,0:08:13.580
It is not a hobby, it is not a game that we try and leave.

0:08:13.580,0:08:17.480
No, you can try; you have no alternative.

0:08:17.480,0:08:21.200
You have to be visible and clear.

0:08:21.200,0:08:26.060
If you are not visible and clear, there is no light.

0:08:26.060,0:08:30.580
You have to position yourself for God to position you.

0:08:30.580,0:08:36.260
Where everything is visible and clear, there is light.

0:08:36.260,0:08:39.340
How do we position ourselves?

0:08:39.340,0:08:44.140
You must know the power you are under.

0:08:44.140,0:08:48.220
You must be here by revelation.

0:08:48.220,0:08:52.020
Not by advice; somebody advised you to come here...

0:08:52.020,0:08:56.140
I think you have to be here by revelation.

0:08:56.140,0:09:01.640
Somebody advised you to come here, or you follow a friend here, or you are looking for your boss;

0:09:01.640,0:09:08.860
your boss is a member of this church, you want to go there, so you use that opportunity to see your boss,

0:09:08.860,0:09:10.460
or your friends.

0:09:10.460,0:09:15.280
Your foundation must be revelation.

0:09:15.280,0:09:25.780
God sent His Word to heal His people and His people are products of revelation.

0:09:25.780,0:09:31.080
If you are here not by revelation, you will be just looking at what is happening here,

0:09:31.080,0:09:34.440
"Oh my God, it happened; but it has not happened to me."

0:09:34.440,0:09:39.600
Does it need to happen to you before you believe?

0:09:39.600,0:09:43.860
I think that when it happens to someone and you are looking how it happened,

0:09:43.860,0:09:49.640
that will give you a grace to receive a "mother of miracles".

0:09:49.640,0:09:51.160
Yes.

0:09:51.160,0:09:54.140
That prepares our faith.

0:09:54.140,0:09:58.520
That makes us stronger.

0:09:58.520,0:10:06.840
You have to be tired of reliving the past in your present life.

0:10:06.840,0:10:16.280
Tell your neighbour, “Be tired of reliving the past in your present life.”

0:10:16.280,0:10:17.820
I cannot hear you.

0:10:17.820,0:10:26.800
"Be tired of reliving the past in your present life.”

0:10:26.800,0:10:29.600
You continue to think of what happened to you yesterday;

0:10:29.600,0:10:35.220
you were disappointed yesterday and you believe that today you also must be disappointed.

0:10:35.220,0:10:39.660
Anywhere you go you continue to think about yesterday's disappointment.

0:10:39.660,0:10:47.880
The way somebody, your husband behaved yesterday; you wake up this morning having that attitude -

0:10:47.880,0:10:55.720
you walk towards your husband, "Good morning", believing that he will behave the same way - no!

0:10:55.720,0:11:05.220
Once you are a Christian, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.

0:11:05.220,0:11:15.520
Once you are a Christian and you are delivered, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.

0:11:15.520,0:11:21.320
I mean, it will no longer control your attitude.

0:11:21.320,0:11:27.660
"I know many things happened to me yesterday - but it was yesterday."

0:11:27.660,0:11:32.420
History; the fact that we didn't make it yesterday makes you believe that you will not make it at all -

0:11:32.420,0:11:35.560
this is the life we live.

0:11:35.560,0:11:47.640
Those processes, thoughts, attitude; an encounter you had yesterday you carry along to process it today.

0:11:47.640,0:11:49.680
It can't work.

0:11:49.680,0:11:55.000
I bind your feet to the path of righteousness, in the name of Jesus!

0:11:55.000,0:11:59.280
Amen!

0:11:59.280,0:12:04.200
Righteousness exalts

0:12:04.200,0:12:08.040
and you are that righteousness of God.

0:12:08.040,0:12:13.340
Jesus has made you righteous.

0:12:13.340,0:12:17.340
I bind your feet to the righteousness of God, in Jesus Christ’s name!

0:12:17.340,0:12:18.200
Amen!

0:12:18.200,0:12:21.000
I bind your feet to the righteousness of God!

0:12:21.000,0:12:22.420
Amen!

0:12:22.420,0:12:24.120
In Jesus Christ’s name!

0:12:24.120,0:12:27.960
Amen!

0:12:27.960,0:12:29.880
Let me see your faith.

0:12:29.880,0:12:35.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:35.500,0:12:38.980
You believe all things pass away, right now?

0:12:38.980,0:12:42.480
Yes!

0:12:42.480,0:12:45.680
You have to be strong; be ready.

0:12:45.680,0:12:52.680
I am just preparing you for the blessing you are about to receive.

0:12:52.680,0:13:03.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:03.440,0:13:07.400
You should be talking about maintenance, not blessing.

0:13:07.400,0:13:11.240
Don't talk about blessing; you are blessed already.

0:13:11.240,0:13:16.300
Blessing is a past tense victory; it is a past tense issue.

0:13:16.300,0:13:17.140
Amen!

0:13:17.140,0:13:21.240
What you are waiting for - blessing - is a past tense issue.

0:13:21.240,0:13:24.540
What you should be talking about is maintenance.

0:13:24.540,0:13:31.700
Everything you have been given; there is nothing you are able to maintain - even your children.

0:13:31.700,0:13:39.140
Some of your children today have become enemies; they can insult or embarrass you.

0:13:39.140,0:13:44.940
When you see them you are afraid even to look at their faces, because of the upbringing.

0:13:44.940,0:13:48.640
Many of you cannot even maintain children God had given to you.

0:13:48.640,0:13:55.480
If you give birth to a child, and you can not maintain it, you cannot train it- what else can you teach them?

0:13:55.480,0:13:59.400
There is nothing you can teach, if you cannot teach your children.

0:13:59.400,0:14:01.700
Baby, you have a birth to...

0:14:01.700,0:14:12.020
Right from an embryo... and suddenly he or she becomes big and now can say,

0:14:12.020,0:14:21.160
"- Please! Don't talk to me like that!
- I'm sorry." That is your baby.

0:14:21.160,0:14:24.960
This is life.

0:14:24.960,0:14:29.140
We are embarrassing ourselves and we think we are embarrassing God.

0:14:29.140,0:14:34.460
Each time you are looking for blessing, "God, bless me!..." - what about the one He has given you?

0:14:34.460,0:14:38.760
Even your little one, baby?

0:14:38.760,0:14:47.540
God rejoices and is happy concerning the way we maintain the blessing given to us.

0:14:47.540,0:14:51.460
How you maintain your blessing will determine how it will increase.

0:14:51.460,0:14:58.840
When you think about many blessings God has given to you, and how you maintained them,

0:14:58.840,0:15:05.640
you will likely not even want to ask God for any blessing, because the one given to you you didn't maintain.

0:15:05.640,0:15:09.220
And you keep asking for more, more, more...

0:15:09.220,0:15:11.920
We are not ashamed.

0:15:11.920,0:15:15.940
Think about maintenance.

0:15:15.940,0:15:17.540
Think about what?

0:15:17.540,0:15:20.620
Maintenance.

0:15:20.620,0:15:27.560
Don’t let the blessing of God control your direction;

0:15:27.560,0:15:31.120
let God who gave you blessing be the Controller.

0:15:31.120,0:15:36.180
Today, it is the blessing God had given to us that is controlling us.

0:15:36.180,0:15:42.340
When money comes, you think it will tell you where to live, what to wear, how to do, how to go to church,

0:15:42.340,0:15:46.100
whether to go to church or not, where to go to church, which kind of church you should go to,

0:15:46.100,0:15:47.740
because of money you have,

0:15:47.740,0:15:51.840
instead of God, who gave you the blessing, to be the Controller.

0:15:51.840,0:15:55.700
This is the maintenance we are talking about.

"I need healing..." - what about the healing you had in the past?

0:16:01.420,0:16:08.300
"I need money, breakthrough, position..."

0:16:08.300,0:16:14.240
Before, you could have spent five hours in the church; now, you have a big position,

0:16:14.240,0:16:20.880
you became director, MD of the company, you cannot spend two minutes in the church any more.

0:16:20.880,0:16:26.180
When you are going to church, you carry your newspaper along with you, as if it was the Bible.

0:16:26.180,0:16:29.500
These are the things God takes into consideration.

0:16:29.500,0:16:36.040
When God looks at all this, He begins to look at this blessing - we are blessed to bless others,

0:16:36.040,0:16:39.060
but today what has happened?

0:16:39.060,0:16:44.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:44.340,0:16:46.420
Think about what?
Maintenance.

0:16:46.420,0:16:49.240
Tell your neighbour, "Think about maintenance".

0:16:49.240,0:16:50.480
I cannot hear you.

0:16:50.480,0:16:52.140
Think about maintenance.

0:16:52.140,0:16:53.280
I cannot hear you.

0:16:53.280,0:16:56.980
Think about maintenance.

0:16:56.980,0:17:04.480
Even our relationship with a husband or wife; we cannot maintain them.

0:17:04.480,0:17:06.280
Whole thing falls apart.

0:17:06.280,0:17:13.820
We fail to understand that the husband and wife - when God brings them together for the purpose of,

0:17:13.820,0:17:23.380
"where she is strong he is weak, and where she is weak he is strong" - that is the meaning of marriage.

0:17:23.380,0:17:26.900
So, we can counsel ourselves.
