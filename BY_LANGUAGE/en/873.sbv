0:00:00.000,0:00:04.200
During the Monday service at the SCOAN

0:00:04.200,0:00:07.620
Prophet TB Joshua is ministering prayer and deliverance

0:00:07.620,0:00:09.740
in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:09.740,0:00:13.420
The name above all names is power and fire

0:00:13.420,0:00:18.000
which causes satan and his agents to tremble and flee.

0:00:18.000,0:00:23.680
As the man of God prays for this man, demons within him manifest violently.

0:00:23.680,0:00:28.100
Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:00:28.100,0:00:31.200
Why are you disturbing me?

0:00:31.200,0:00:38.420
He was donated to me by his great grandfather.

0:00:38.420,0:00:48.000
When he was seven 7 days old, I wanted to take him; they dedicated him to me.

0:00:48.000,0:00:51.300
(Who are you?)

0:00:51.300,0:00:53.480
Idol from the father's house.

0:00:53.480,0:00:56.960
(What have you done to him?)

0:00:56.960,0:01:02.060
I have used him in so many ways.

0:01:02.060,0:01:04.700
(Explain!)

0:01:04.700,0:01:06.580
He's meant to serve me!

0:01:06.580,0:01:12.900
He has no career, has no future.

0:01:12.900,0:01:18.120
He has a heart of helping, but I can't allow him.

0:01:18.120,0:01:21.020
I have destroyed him in so many ways

0:01:21.020,0:01:27.520
I have destroyed him in giving him so many sicknesses - cancer!

0:01:27.520,0:01:31.760
Every evil thing you can think of - I have made him do.

0:01:31.760,0:01:33.980
He womanises.

0:01:33.980,0:01:42.360
I have destroyed his family; his family is nothing to write home about - all of them.

0:01:42.360,0:01:48.660
I took the mother. I took his father. I gave his daughter cancer.

0:01:48.660,0:01:51.560
I gave him cancer

0:01:51.560,0:01:54.300
Even his first son is not even talking for five years now.

0:01:54.300,0:01:56.000
- Who caused it?!
- I did!

0:01:56.000,0:01:57.360
Who are you?

0:01:57.360,0:01:58.620
Idol from his father's house.

0:01:58.620,0:02:00.140
How did you enter this body?

0:02:00.140,0:02:04.180
He was dedicated to me
 when he was seven days old.

0:02:04.180,0:02:09.840
Satan and his agents are powerless in the face of God's might and the man is delivered in seconds.

0:02:09.840,0:02:11.180
Thank you, Jesus!

0:02:11.180,0:02:15.860
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:15.860,0:02:19.460
People of God - Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:19.460,0:02:21.580
Good morning church.

0:02:21.580,0:02:27.360
My name is Mr. Prince Obaerechi

0:02:27.360,0:02:31.320
The lady beside me is my wife.

0:02:31.320,0:02:34.120
It all started like this:

0:02:34.120,0:02:41.840
when I was 10 -12 years old, I noticed something unusual happening,

0:02:41.840,0:02:46.720
but those were things that I could not be able to control on my own.

0:02:46.720,0:02:50.300
Sometimes I went against my wish to do them,

0:02:50.300,0:02:57.040
but after doing those things I would feel so guilty for doing them and tomorrow I would still do them again.

0:02:57.040,0:02:58.260
Things like...

0:02:58.260,0:03:05.840
At the age 10-12 years I had a group of friends, living in the same neighbourhood.

0:03:05.840,0:03:11.140
... things like stealing little things from the people in the community.

0:03:11.140,0:03:15.760
I started from stealing money from my mothers handbag and using it...

0:03:15.760,0:03:19.420
At the end of the day, when asked, I would deny stealing it.

0:03:19.420,0:03:24.300
It went on like that for so many years.

0:03:24.300,0:03:27.820
When I was growing up, I noticed that something was wrong,

0:03:27.820,0:03:33.160
but I couldn't "fish out" what really was happening.

0:03:33.160,0:03:36.020
In 2006 I lost my mother.

0:03:36.020,0:03:41.420
After the burial, my mum's sister called a family meeting,

0:03:41.420,0:03:45.700
saying that there was something that they wanted to tell me.

0:03:45.700,0:03:47.500
I asked what it was.

0:03:47.500,0:03:53.280
They told me that when I was born...

0:03:53.280,0:04:01.400
From the first day I was delivered here on earth, I cried continually for 7 days.

0:04:01.400,0:04:09.880
My mother had no option but to take me to her father, who happened to be a very strong native doctor.

0:04:09.880,0:04:14.000
He never wore anything on his feet until when he died.

0:04:14.000,0:04:18.240
Every thing in his compound was a shrine - he was as strong as that.

0:04:18.240,0:04:24.140
Nevertheless, he wasn't able to find solution, so he went to another bigger witch doctor.

0:04:24.140,0:04:31.800
They consulted the witch doctor and he said that he was the one who came back as an incarnation,

0:04:31.800,0:04:36.200
that he wasn't supposed to be alive, that he was supposed to die before he came back.

0:04:36.200,0:04:38.620
But there's was nothing the man could have done.

0:04:38.620,0:04:44.340
They asked what they could do - he said that either they leave me to die,

0:04:44.340,0:04:49.160
or they go and buy things mentioned to them.

0:04:49.160,0:04:53.540
They were told to go to 3 junctions and perform some sacrifices, by 12 am.

0:04:53.540,0:04:55.340
After the sacrifice...

0:04:55.340,0:04:59.100
The man would die for me to live.

0:04:59.100,0:05:02.140
It was a very big problem in the house.

0:05:02.140,0:05:03.440
They went back home.

0:05:03.440,0:05:09.440
The father of my mother had so many wives but he loved my mum, as his first daughter.

0:05:09.440,0:05:11.660
He never wanted to disappoint my mum.

0:05:11.660,0:05:16.500
One day he called a meeting and said that he is going to do the sacrifice.

0:05:16.500,0:05:19.940
They asked him what would happen after the sacrifice.

0:05:19.940,0:05:27.940
He told them that they should keep me behind; when I grow up I would continue where he stopped.

0:05:27.940,0:05:34.500
So, they went and purchased the items mentioned to them by the "bigger" witch-doctor they went to.

0:05:34.500,0:05:38.760
By 12 am the sacrifice was conducted

0:05:38.760,0:05:41.680
After few days the man died.

0:05:41.680,0:05:46.100
That is how I stopped crying.

0:05:46.100,0:05:49.320
The story did not make sense to me,

0:05:49.320,0:05:51.900
I asked why was the story coming then?

0:05:51.900,0:05:55.600
Why didn't it come before, when my mother was alive?

0:05:55.600,0:06:01.200
The woman told me that she was the only woman who was living with my mum at that time.

0:06:01.200,0:06:04.600
She knew everything that happened.

0:06:04.600,0:06:08.180
But later the woman repented; she was the deaconess in the Assembly of God church.

0:06:08.180,0:06:10.120
My mum also repented.

0:06:10.120,0:06:12.440
However they Ignored the idol.

0:06:12.440,0:06:17.840
I never knew, all this years, that the idol was living in me and walking in me.

0:06:17.840,0:06:20.580
As the time went by, I was growing up and the story didn't mean anything to me.

0:06:20.580,0:06:24.980
I started hanging out with my old friends.

0:06:24.980,0:06:31.480
Some of those friends grown up to be mature, having their own gangs.

0:06:31.480,0:06:36.820
Sometimes they could call me and we would go to people houses and burgle them,

0:06:36.820,0:06:39.300
and take them away; sometimes we took money from them.

0:06:39.300,0:06:42.160
One strange thing always happened.

0:06:42.160,0:06:50.840
If I kept looking at a glass cup on the desk and I would be imagining that glass cup will fall down and break;

0:06:50.880,0:06:55.780
I would be imagining for 4 or 5 minutes, then and you would see that glass cup fall down and break.

0:06:55.780,0:07:04.680
If anybody offended me, they must have had a big problem, leading to accident, or...

0:07:04.680,0:07:07.160
You must get yourself in a very big problem.

0:07:07.160,0:07:09.740
I was very proud of it.

0:07:09.740,0:07:13.120
During those days, I made a lot of money.

0:07:13.120,0:07:18.080
I was using big cars, I made money; the money was coming.

0:07:18.080,0:07:24.600
You made us to understand that it was immediately after the death of the father of your mother,

0:07:24.600,0:07:27.160
when this spirit fully possessed you.

0:07:27.160,0:07:28.720
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

0:07:28.720,0:07:31.980
- You were said to be his incarnation?
- Yes.

0:07:31.980,0:07:34.620
- And he was a notorious witch doctor during his time?
- Yes.

0:07:34.620,0:07:36.280
It goes this way:

0:07:36.280,0:07:38.520
If you have a mission to carry out...

0:07:38.520,0:07:42.360
We thought that we were very smart and intelligent.

0:07:42.360,0:07:47.080
We would go to a witch doctor for a consultation

0:07:47.080,0:07:50.220
During the consultation we were called to look in the mirror,

0:07:50.220,0:07:54.380
and the witch doctor would tell you if you would make it or not.

0:07:54.380,0:07:57.780
He would tell you if you are going to succeed or not.

0:07:57.780,0:08:02.660
If there was a problem, you would have to fortify yourself before the journey.

0:08:02.660,0:08:10.860
When we entered the house, I didn't need to ask where the money was; I knew it.

0:08:10.860,0:08:12.680
I would go straight where the money was and I would pick it.

0:08:12.680,0:08:15.920
That is how it was working for me.

0:08:15.920,0:08:26.120
In 2010, I noticed a problem - a growth that became bigger at daily basis.

0:08:26.120,0:08:38.120
Another time I noticed other growth on my hip; this one was growing bigger than the first one.

0:08:38.120,0:08:40.040
So I hid it to myself; I didn't want to tell anybody.

0:08:40.040,0:08:42.880
I started going to hospitals.

0:08:42.880,0:08:48.280
There is no hospital in Nigeria that I did not go to.

0:08:48.280,0:08:50.700
I went to witch-doctors.

0:08:50.700,0:08:52.920
I went to prayer houses.

0:08:52.920,0:08:59.280
I went to many churches, which I don't want to call names - many churches.

0:08:59.280,0:09:05.220
I didn't want to die, because all these years I thought I was careful not to lose my life.

0:09:05.220,0:09:08.340
But this sickness came.

0:09:08.340,0:09:11.340
I would have gone to any place, no matter the cost.

0:09:11.340,0:09:16.860
There was a place, where I told a man, "If my health was going to cost a human head - tell me."

0:09:16.860,0:09:17.840
I was ready.

0:09:17.840,0:09:25.780
When the health issue stepped in, I started selling things because all my money was gone.

0:09:25.780,0:09:35.260
As there was no solution, I started selling my properties, cars, but at end of the day nothing happened.

0:09:35.260,0:09:40.740
The person that bought my last car asked me, "Why can't you go to the Synagogue?"

0:09:40.740,0:09:42.620
I said, "Stop telling me that."

0:09:42.620,0:09:51.720
We used to read papers, where they castigated the man of God, and wrote rubbish about him.

0:09:51.720,0:09:56.360
We found it very comfortable to neglect the existence of God.

0:09:56.360,0:10:02.160
Because there was someone castigating the man of God, we could say, "There was no God".

0:10:02.160,0:10:06.040
Our conclusion was that all of them were the same.

0:10:06.040,0:10:08.840
I asked him, if he wanted to escape paying my money.

0:10:08.840,0:10:14.800
I wanted to treat myself, I had spent all my money; I sold my car...

0:10:14.800,0:10:20.300
He told me of somebody who had diabetes, who had come and had received the Morning Water;

0:10:20.300,0:10:22.640
he was healed before he got home.

0:10:22.640,0:10:24.760
I told him to stop all those stories .

0:10:24.760,0:10:28.960
Then a friend of mine, who resides in Bayelsa State, was burying his mother;

0:10:28.960,0:10:30.720
I went to his mothers burial.

0:10:30.720,0:10:34.380
I then opened up to him, telling him what I was going through.

0:10:34.380,0:10:35.880
He is a member of this church.

0:10:35.880,0:10:37.680
He asked me If I had gone to The SCOAN.

0:10:37.680,0:10:39.520
I asked him to leave that conversation.

0:10:39.520,0:10:41.080
He tried preaching to me.

0:10:41.080,0:10:45.780
While the hearse was still going, he told me that I needed to go to The SCOAN.

0:10:45.780,0:10:49.720
I said I didn't want to go there, but he insisted.

0:10:49.720,0:10:54.220
At that time he provoked me and said, "Young man, if you choose to want to know God; - know God.

0:10:54.220,0:11:02.340
If you choose not to want to know God - leave it. This life is a battlefield and not a playground."

0:11:02.340,0:11:06.980
After he had said this I was contemplating, "This word is a battlefield and not a playground.

0:11:06.980,0:11:11.200
If you choose to want to know God - know God 
if you don't want - leave it"

0:11:11.200,0:11:14.380
At that time, these words kept ringing inside my mind.

0:11:14.380,0:11:16.760
When I tried to forget about it, it didn't go away easily.

0:11:16.760,0:11:20.280
It became as a little stream in my heart that refused to get dry.

0:11:20.280,0:11:22.140
At that time, there was a hotel I used to stay in.

0:11:22.140,0:11:27.580
At that time, I didn't go out "openly"; I always went to the rural areas and lodged there,

0:11:27.580,0:11:31.160
so that those who knew me would not see me.

0:11:31.160,0:11:34.000
So, I was staying in the hotel.

0:11:34.000,0:11:38.080
When all my hope was lost, I called one of my brothers, a friend.

0:11:38.080,0:11:43.460
I told him,  "Young man I've seen my death. I know that I am going to die but before I die,

0:11:43.460,0:11:46.080
look at how my burial would happen."

0:11:46.080,0:11:51.860
After that conversation with him, I began to scatter things in the room.

0:11:51.860,0:11:55.760
Somebody that was inside with me said that I should cool down I would not die.

0:11:55.760,0:12:00.540
In the meantime, the television went off in my hotel room.

0:12:00.540,0:12:05.640
Somebody was trying to fix it I found Emmanuel TV.

0:12:05.640,0:12:10.780
When Emmanuel TV was on...

0:12:10.780,0:12:16.740
I began to watch, I saw testimonies, healing and many things.

0:12:16.740,0:12:23.860
I wondered if this was the same man that they said things about.

0:12:23.860,0:12:26.140
Yet, I had not been convinced.

0:12:26.140,0:12:32.760
At the end of the day, I said to myself, "I went to herbal homes, prayer-houses,  churches;

0:12:32.760,0:12:33.940
let me also go there."

0:12:33.940,0:12:38.500
I came only to try, like I tried in other places before.

0:12:38.500,0:12:41.920
When I came to the gate, a voice spoke to me to go back.

0:12:41.920,0:12:46.800
I went back to my hotel.

0:12:46.800,0:12:50.740
A friend advised me to go to India.

0:12:50.740,0:12:56.860
I went to India; this was my first time I was in India...

0:12:56.860,0:12:59.800
This is a medical visa.

0:12:59.800,0:13:02.300
I went and came back, I want to max hospital

0:13:02.300,0:13:05.400
and I spent three months nothing happened.

0:13:05.400,0:13:09.380
I came back, I went back to another hospital in India,

0:13:09.380,0:13:11.240
I spent three months there and I came back.

0:13:11.240,0:13:19.260
I went back there again to "Action Cancer" hospital in New Delhi, in India.

0:13:19.260,0:13:24.500
When I came back, they asked me to come back to SCOAN, since I already was in India.

0:13:24.500,0:13:28.540
The last time I was in India, the doctor asked me, "Who did I come with?"

0:13:28.540,0:13:30.640
I said, I hadn't come with anybody.

0:13:30.640,0:13:31.740
He left.

0:13:31.740,0:13:35.440
There was a young man I met in the flat while I was going; he had somebody there...

0:13:35.440,0:13:36.640
I told him, "Look, where I'm going".

0:13:36.640,0:13:37.800
I gave him my number.

0:13:37.800,0:13:43.340
After few days, the person who received my number called me and they located me.

0:13:43.340,0:13:47.180
The man said that since there was nobody with me, he wanted to assist me.

0:13:47.180,0:13:52.100
He took me to the "Action cancer" hospital, where I was before.

0:13:52.100,0:14:06.020
During my first medical check-up, the doctor shook his head, and he was a senior doctor.

0:14:06.020,0:14:10.700
He shook his head and asked me to go, and the man who was with me stayed with the doctor.

0:14:10.700,0:14:12.740
When the man came out, he was sweating.

0:14:12.740,0:14:14.160
I asked him what happened.

0:14:14.160,0:14:20.080
He said that I needed some relative to sign medical documents,

0:14:20.080,0:14:24.500
and he couldn't do it because he didn't know me, and anything could happen.

0:14:24.500,0:14:30.640
He began to tell me the stories of people who came from Nigeria with cancer and died.

0:14:30.640,0:14:32.700
My mind was troubled.

0:14:32.700,0:14:35.220
I asked him to go with me back to the doctor.

0:14:35.220,0:14:42.980
Doctor told me that he was giving me only 25% of chances.

0:14:42.980,0:14:48.280
Before, I heard that doctors would give 50/50 of chances, but in my case they gave only 25%.

0:14:48.280,0:14:54.100
I asked why they gave me so low chances.

0:14:54.100,0:14:55.320
I was scared.

0:14:55.320,0:15:02.520
I came back to Nigeria and I received Morning Water and I went home.

0:15:02.520,0:15:06.020
When I arrived home I was not satisfied.

0:15:06.020,0:15:11.000
I submitted request for another passport to make a trip.

0:15:11.000,0:15:15.460
It takes four days to obtain visa.

0:15:15.460,0:15:23.680
In the meantime my leg and my manhood have swollen.

0:15:23.680,0:15:30.120
I couldn't have worn shorts or trousers - I had to wear loose clothing.

0:15:30.120,0:15:35.760
If you had pressed any part of my body, it would not return to its place.

0:15:35.760,0:15:40.440
The pain was unbearable - you wouldn't wish it to anybody.

0:15:40.440,0:15:46.680
When I got the Morning Water, I started to minister it and the pain went away;

0:15:46.680,0:15:51.860
a pain that previously made me to run naked at midnight...

0:15:51.860,0:15:53.860
So, the Morning Water...

0:15:53.860,0:15:59.440
Mr & Mrs Prince Obaerechi
Deliverance Testimony

0:15:59.440,0:16:06.080
That is not enough for Jesus Christ; put you hands together beautifully for the miracle working God.

0:16:06.080,0:16:15.240
You made us to understand that as consequence of your involvement in acts of immorality,

0:16:15.240,0:16:21.360
experiencing the influence of the spirit possessing you from the childhood,

0:16:21.360,0:16:24.020
you were afflicted with a pelvic cancer.

0:16:24.020,0:16:27.780
People were hearing to your story, how sever it was; they would like to see it pictorially.

0:16:27.780,0:16:32.080
Can you show us on pictures what are you talking about, before you continue?

0:16:32.080,0:16:36.620
People will see how severe the case was, for them to know that satan has nothing to offer,

0:16:36.620,0:16:37.760
apart from affliction.

0:16:37.760,0:16:41.940
This is how it was, when I came first time.

0:16:41.940,0:16:48.040
By the time I entered the gate, one spirit told me to go back and I went back and travelled to India.

0:16:48.040,0:16:51.240
There, they gave me 25% of surviving and I came back to Nigeria.

0:16:51.240,0:16:56.080
When I came back, this is the way it was - as you can see...

0:16:56.080,0:17:02.500
These things are my flesh, and these is my lap; the cancer had shrunk...

0:17:02.500,0:17:08.080
As you see, my manhood was affected; it was very large.

0:17:08.080,0:17:11.860
It gave an intensive and offensive smell.

0:17:11.860,0:17:14.940
When I got the Morning Water, I started to minister it.

0:17:14.940,0:17:23.420
Before the visa came, I noticed that this unbearable pain was gone.

0:17:23.420,0:17:27.180
I said, "The pain is gone - OK..."

0:17:27.180,0:17:33.240
Mr & Mrs Prince Obaerechi
Deliverance Testimony

0:17:33.240,0:17:37.840
I said, "OK, since this pain is gone, we will see what happens next".

0:17:37.840,0:17:49.740
Day after day I kept seeing changes; the swelling leg started to shrink, so I was able to wear trousers.

0:17:49.740,0:17:53.020
I picked up the visa, but I didn't use the passport.

0:17:53.020,0:17:55.020
I said that something was happening.

0:17:55.020,0:17:58.060
When I calmed down, I was very happy.

0:17:58.060,0:18:04.740
When the leg shrunk down, I began to watch the wound and minister the Morning Water to it.

0:18:04.740,0:18:10.900
In the hospital they told me that I shouldn't pour water on the wound.

0:18:10.900,0:18:18.600
When I saw that the wound was shrinking I kept ministering the Morning Water to it.

0:18:18.600,0:18:25.920
The wound kept drying... I was very surprised, till it came like this...

0:18:25.920,0:18:28.260
OK, just a moment.

0:18:28.260,0:18:37.580
Before you finally saw the changes, you travelled to India twice, in search of solution?

0:18:37.580,0:18:39.880
- Yes, sir.
- All to no avail?

0:18:39.880,0:18:43.260
And you said you had been preparing for the third visit to India?

0:18:43.260,0:18:43.800
Yes.

0:18:43.800,0:18:48.320
But after receiving the Morning Water, when you started to see changes, you resigned to go to India?

0:18:48.320,0:18:49.340
Perfectly correct, sir.

0:18:49.340,0:18:56.740
And you got your healing in the ministry you were criticizing?

0:18:56.740,0:18:57.660
Perfectly correct, sir.

0:18:57.660,0:19:03.000
OK, can you go to the board and show the present condition of your pelvic?

0:19:03.000,0:19:10.420
After ministering the Morning Water, the situation finally looks like this - I'm OK, no pain.

0:19:10.420,0:19:18.740
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:19:18.740,0:19:27.460
You can see on the screen of you TV his present condition, as he stands in our midst.

0:19:27.460,0:19:30.620
There is a clear proof that after the ministration of the Morning Water,

0:19:30.620,0:19:33.160
the pelvic cancer is completely gone.

0:19:33.160,0:19:36.420
And for the benefit of the viewers all over the world; could you just tap the place right now,

0:19:36.420,0:19:38.780
and tell us how you are feeling?

0:19:38.780,0:19:40.040
How are you feeling?

0:19:40.040,0:19:45.020
Nothing, I don't feel anything; it's already gone, as I'm talking to you...

0:19:45.020,0:19:49.420
Before, I couldn't even dare to...

0:19:49.420,0:19:50.820
You couldn't do like this before?

0:19:50.820,0:19:53.940
I couldn't even try it, or get close to that place.

0:19:53.940,0:19:55.240
Why you couldn't do it then?

0:19:55.240,0:19:56.940
Because of the pain.

0:19:56.940,0:20:05.900
The thing was huge - it was a cancer of lymphoma, it can come on any part of the body.

0:20:05.900,0:20:07.640
- But now you are completely free?
- Yes, sir.

0:20:07.640,0:20:10.680
The cancer is gone, and the pain is gone?

0:20:10.680,0:20:12.020
- You are healed and healthy?
- Yes, sir.

0:20:12.020,0:20:20.880
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again!

0:20:20.880,0:20:24.180
I started having those dreams, as if I was in the past.

0:20:24.180,0:20:33.740
I would see myself in the village, with my gang; we were very small.

0:20:33.740,0:20:38.100
The friend for mine said, "Let's go to a witch-doctor".

0:20:38.100,0:20:40.040
I said OK.

0:20:40.040,0:20:41.400
He said he didn't have money.

0:20:41.400,0:20:43.460
I gave him money and he went.

0:20:43.460,0:20:48.200
When he came back he told me, "Yes, this is a place to be."

0:20:48.200,0:20:52.840
I said, "OK. I want to go to that place, since it is a place to be there."

0:20:52.840,0:20:54.640
I went to that place.

0:20:54.640,0:21:02.160
They cut my finger, took my hair, marked my chest and feet and put my blood on a calabash.

0:21:02.160,0:21:05.680
They directed me to the shrine, telling to ask for anything I wanted.

0:21:05.680,0:21:09.920
After this... the only thing they eat in the shrine is blood.

0:21:09.920,0:21:12.320
I made some promises and I came back.

0:21:12.320,0:21:14.320
The whole thing became worse.

0:21:14.320,0:21:20.140
When I came back I hated myself, "Why did I go there?"

0:21:20.140,0:21:22.140
Something inside of me said, "Forget about it."

0:21:22.140,0:21:26.600
That's how I got to know two human natures existing in you;

0:21:26.600,0:21:30.540
one will be telling you positive things, the other the negative ones.

0:21:30.540,0:21:35.640
The one you choose to follow, that one will work for you.

0:21:35.640,0:21:37.780
At the end of the day...

0:21:37.780,0:21:44.740
Three weeks ago I was in the dream and it was said that the man of God would be coming somewhere.

0:21:44.740,0:21:45.640
I said I would go there.

0:21:45.640,0:21:46.300
I went to the place.

0:21:46.300,0:21:52.580
When I came to the place I saw people in white garments, but I didn't see the man of God there.

0:21:52.580,0:22:02.340
I looked on the front and I saw man of God touching people,

0:22:02.340,0:22:06.200
and I run to man of God to touch me - I slumped.

0:22:06.200,0:22:11.640
When I slumped, it looked like I was confessing something, but I didn't know what I was saying.

0:22:11.640,0:22:13.760
Later I got up.

0:22:13.760,0:22:16.320
Can you tell us who the man of God you are talking about was?

0:22:16.320,0:22:19.420
Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:19.420,0:22:24.380
Mr & Mrs Prince Obaerechi
Deliverance Testimony

0:22:24.380,0:22:30.800
When I woke I began to have this "disturbance"; the voice would say, "Go to Synagogue",

0:22:30.800,0:22:36.060
when I'm eating, "Go to Synagogue", when I take a bath, "Go to Synagogue".

0:22:36.060,0:22:42.580
After two days of having that dream, when it became to much, around 2:30 pm,

0:22:42.580,0:22:47.920
I picked up my luggages and I entered a cab to go to Lagos.

0:22:47.920,0:22:50.900
Normally, at that time you wouldn't see any vehicle coming to Lagos.

0:22:50.900,0:22:54.160
Inside the cab I was uncomfortable, until I fell asleep.

0:22:54.160,0:22:56.860
When I woke up I saw myself in Lagos.

0:22:56.860,0:22:59.360
On Sunday I was at the service; man of God started a mass prayer.

0:22:59.360,0:23:05.000
During that mass prayer I noticed that my chest, stomach, system - everything just changed.

0:23:05.000,0:23:08.840
My mouth were full; because I don't like watching people vomit - it irritates me.

0:23:08.840,0:23:10.880
I didn't want to vomit.

0:23:10.880,0:23:13.960
When I opened my mouth, I vomited so many things.

0:23:13.960,0:23:16.320
I was very happy; my body calmed down.

0:23:16.320,0:23:18.660
On Monday, I was here.

0:23:18.660,0:23:21.780
When the man of God was laying hands on people...

0:23:21.780,0:23:26.600
When there were only two people before mu turn, I noticed that I was shaking, all my body was vibrating.

0:23:26.600,0:23:29.320
I couldn't even look at his face.

0:23:29.320,0:23:34.260
Just now I see when he touched me, and I don't know what happened.

0:23:34.260,0:23:38.400
I woke up and saw myself being finally delivered.

0:23:38.400,0:23:45.980
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:23:45.980,0:23:52.300
Eventually, you were delivered that Monday, as you can see on the left-hand side of the TV screen.

0:23:52.300,0:23:55.420
You made us to understand that you were unconscious, and you didn't know what happened,

0:23:55.420,0:23:58.180
until now, as you watch the video clip.

0:23:58.180,0:23:59.240
Now, tell us...

0:23:59.240,0:24:00.580
We believe...

0:24:00.580,0:24:02.900
You experience it, and your body knows it.

0:24:02.900,0:24:05.100
Tell us what are the changes you have seen in your life.

0:24:05.100,0:24:08.580
Compare your life before the deliverance and after the deliverance.

0:24:08.580,0:24:13.600
Before the deliverance, normally I had those dreams with women molesting me.

0:24:13.600,0:24:16.320
When I woke up, I would find myself wet.

0:24:16.320,0:24:19.080
I always had that spirit of lust.

0:24:19.080,0:24:23.680
I never had a rest, a peace of mind.

0:24:23.680,0:24:32.060
But since that Monday, I slept peacefully; somebody had to wake me up.

0:24:32.060,0:24:35.560
Somebody was complaining that there was a mosquito, but I didn't even feel it.

0:24:35.560,0:24:37.560
I was sleeping, I was at peace.

0:24:37.560,0:24:44.880
In the dream I was fighting people and killing them; so many of them.

0:24:44.880,0:24:46.140
When I woke up, I was even afraid.

0:24:46.140,0:24:48.160
I told the dream to my friend and he said it was a good dream.

0:24:48.160,0:24:53.440
OK, in other words, God gave you victory over the demons that were attacking you in the dream?

0:24:53.440,0:24:54.200
Perfectly correct, sir.

0:24:54.200,0:24:58.100
OK, now, tell us, what changes you have seen on your body.

0:24:58.100,0:25:00.220
Concerning the spirit of lust - is it over?

0:25:00.220,0:25:02.260
Concerning the spirit of anger - is it over?

0:25:02.260,0:25:03.900
What about your relationship with your family members?

0:25:03.900,0:25:06.440
What can you say about that after your deliverance?

0:25:06.440,0:25:08.140
Before now...

0:25:08.140,0:25:14.840
My wife can testify that while I'm angry I could put down this building within five minutes.

0:25:14.840,0:25:16.360
Yes.

0:25:16.360,0:25:19.800
I didn't go angry more than three times in a year, because my anger spoils things.

0:25:19.800,0:25:23.680
And I would never regret spoiling things.

0:25:23.680,0:25:32.840
But I noticed that I take things more lightly, since the deliverance.

0:25:32.840,0:25:40.260
I would just overlook those things.

0:25:40.260,0:25:53.440
On Tuesday, somebody called me from Abuja with an information of federal contract for me.

0:25:53.440,0:25:59.620
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:25:59.620,0:26:00.800
I have two advices.

0:26:00.800,0:26:16.960
One is for the parents: "Sometimes the things you do to help your children, can destroy them.

0:26:16.960,0:26:22.980
When you have parental issues, try to look for God first, before any other thing."

0:26:22.980,0:26:27.100
Two; the youth out there who is watching me right now,

0:26:27.100,0:26:33.320
"When you grow up, you will start noticing changes - things that are not normal in your life.

0:26:33.320,0:26:40.140
I wouldn't advise you to go to churches; I went to churches, to herbal homes, witch-doctors;

0:26:40.140,0:26:41.120
they couldn't deliver me.

0:26:41.120,0:26:49.460
I came to The SCOAN, the place I didn't want to hear about, here I got my deliverance.

0:26:49.460,0:26:54.600
Make haste! Don't waste time! Find yourself in the arena of liberty.

0:26:54.600,0:27:00.240
That God that saw me through, will definitely see you through!"

0:27:00.240,0:27:02.560
To God be the glory.

0:27:02.560,0:27:09.020
Yes, we believe that our membership in local churches is merely symbolic.

0:27:09.020,0:27:12.080
What counts is Christ in you; the hope of glory.

0:27:12.080,0:27:15.740
We believe that summary of the advice is that everyone should make haste,

0:27:15.740,0:27:20.000
and look for Jesus Christ in any living church - is that true?

0:27:20.000,0:27:21.840
- Yes, sir.
- To God be the glory.

0:27:21.840,0:27:24.060
Emmanuel!
(God with us.)

0:27:24.060,0:27:27.020
Good morning church.

0:27:27.020,0:27:31.900
My name is Elizabeth Obaerechi.

0:27:31.900,0:27:36.600
This is my lovely husband Mr Obaerechi.

0:27:36.600,0:27:42.320
Even before I married him, I knew he was a bad guy...

0:27:42.320,0:27:49.520
He told me that nobody could deliver him - that is what he always was saying.

0:27:49.520,0:27:52.640
No human could talk to him.

0:27:52.640,0:28:02.500
I just want to thank this great God of Prophet T.B. Joshua; that God used him to deliver my husband.

0:28:02.500,0:28:04.000
To God be the glory.

0:28:04.000,0:28:08.640
Amen! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:28:08.640,0:28:09.960
To God be the glory.

0:28:09.960,0:28:14.400
We thank you so much for your patience all this while; you didn't give up on God,

0:28:14.400,0:28:17.840
you were with him to see this very day of his glorious testimony.

0:28:17.840,0:28:20.040
What is your advice to women like you, out there?

0:28:20.040,0:28:27.760
Yes, I thank God, that Prophet T.B. Joshua is still alive; you must be delivered,

0:28:27.760,0:28:30.220
so my happiness will be complete.

0:28:30.220,0:28:30.860
I thank God...

0:28:30.860,0:28:36.500
I want to give an advice to the fellow women, like me: they should be patient and trust God.

0:28:36.500,0:28:38.500
Nothing is impossible for God to do.

0:28:38.500,0:28:41.580
Amen! Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that.

0:28:41.580,0:28:42.480
To God be the glory.

0:28:42.480,0:28:48.080
Finally, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in the life of your husband and your own,

0:28:48.080,0:28:51.960
for giving you enough patience to bear the situation with him, until present moment,

0:28:51.960,0:28:54.580
when he is glorifying God with his testimony.

0:28:54.580,0:28:57.940
Remember, the deliverance, the healing came through the Word of God,

0:28:57.940,0:29:01.440
and we advise you to go and make the Word of God the standard for your lives.

0:29:01.440,0:29:06.300
As you do so, always have at the back of you minds that better is not good enough,

0:29:06.300,0:29:08.300
the best is always yet to come.

0:29:08.300,0:29:15.300
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!
