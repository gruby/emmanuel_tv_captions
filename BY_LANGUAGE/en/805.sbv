The SCOAN prayer line - the arena of liberty,

0:00:04.160,0:00:08.400
where Prophet T.B. Joshua is being used as an instrument of healing, deliverance

0:00:08.400,0:00:10.440
and all of God's blessings.

0:00:10.440,0:00:15.500
People from different countries all over the globe fall under the power of the Holy Spirit

0:00:15.500,0:00:20.400
and freedom comes to every area of their life, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:20.400,0:00:23.360
As he prayed for the people, he encountered this lady

0:00:23.360,0:00:30.000
and the evil spirit that controlled her life and actions was exposed.

0:00:30.000,0:00:32.020
Who are you?

0:00:32.020,0:00:32.920
Stand right!

0:00:32.920,0:00:34.080
Who are you?

0:00:34.080,0:00:37.160
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:37.160,0:00:39.160
I am from the water.

0:00:39.160,0:00:41.120
She doesn’t belong to anybody.

0:00:41.120,0:00:43.420
She is precious to the kingdom.

0:00:43.420,0:00:46.520
You have the spirit of woman.

0:00:46.520,0:00:50.880
My master sent me to her to destroy her.

0:00:50.880,0:00:53.520
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:00:53.520,0:00:55.860
I couldn't kill her because I love her.

0:00:55.860,0:00:58.860
Deliverance In Jesus’ Name

0:00:58.860,0:01:02.520
I'm a spirit woman.

0:01:02.520,0:01:04.420
She belongs to me.

0:01:04.420,0:01:08.380
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:08.380,0:01:11.720
I made her to love women only.

0:01:11.720,0:01:16.420
She is precious and I love her; she is not going to go.

0:01:16.420,0:01:22.800
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:22.800,0:01:25.480
I am her wife.

0:01:25.480,0:01:28.380
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:28.380,0:01:32.180
Deliverance In Jesus’ Name

0:01:32.180,0:01:36.480
Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.

0:01:36.480,0:01:41.340
The evil spirit confessed all its destructive acts in the life of this woman,

0:01:41.340,0:01:45.260
and it is finally loosed from her, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:01:45.260,0:01:52.140
To God be the glory - she is free, and she rises to her feet; a new creation in Christ Jesus.

0:01:52.140,0:01:53.520
Hallelujah!

0:01:53.520,0:01:57.540
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:57.540,0:02:00.220
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:02:00.220,0:02:05.860
My name is Genevieve Anyama, I’m from Imo State; I'm a Nigerian.

0:02:05.860,0:02:13.900
I studied in India and the person beside me is my sister.

0:02:13.900,0:02:18.660
We both reside in India.

0:02:18.660,0:02:26.260
I had the spirit of woman as the prophet had said which was true.

0:02:26.260,0:02:35.980
When I was a child, at the age of nine, I had a dream where I found myself in the water

0:02:35.980,0:02:42.240
and they crowned me as a king and presented a woman to me to marry as my queen.

0:02:42.240,0:02:47.720
When I woke up, I wondered what was going on because I could not understand the dream.

0:02:47.720,0:02:52.340
At that age, I just ignored it.

0:02:52.340,0:03:02.280
After some time, I changed and abandoned all the male friends that I had.

0:03:02.280,0:03:07.880
I didn’t like them anymore and started having more female friends.

0:03:07.880,0:03:09.960
I felt so comfortable with them.

0:03:09.960,0:03:17.860
I didn’t desire men because I felt like I was already a man; so, why would I have male friends?

0:03:17.860,0:03:29.300
That was how that spirit entered into me and started manifesting in me

0:03:29.300,0:03:34.600
and I started having that feeling – feelings for my fellow girls.

0:03:34.600,0:03:39.120
Can you tell us once again; what was the spirit that was in you then?

0:03:39.120,0:03:40.980
I had the spirit of woman.

0:03:40.980,0:03:48.180
How did this spirit of woman affect you, and what did it push you to do?

0:03:48.180,0:03:55.040
The feeling was getting stronger

0:03:55.040,0:04:01.120
and it pushed me to the extent that I became more attracted to them.

0:04:01.120,0:04:05.420
I was kind of scared and I was going along with that.

0:04:05.420,0:04:09.980
The thing was affecting me so badly that I didn't know myself totally,

0:04:09.980,0:04:12.360
and didn’t know what was happening to me.

0:04:12.360,0:04:16.680
I saw myself as a man but when I looked into the mirror, I was a girl.

0:04:16.680,0:04:19.520
I thought to myself what is happening to me because I am a lady, a girl,

0:04:19.520,0:04:21.780
but I behaved like a man.

0:04:21.780,0:04:26.400
I wore boys’ clothes and behaved like a boy.

0:04:26.400,0:04:28.620
That was how I grew up.

0:04:28.620,0:04:34.300
My education was nothing to write home about because my grades were so poor.

0:04:34.300,0:04:39.340
I was not concentrating and my health was down as well.

0:04:39.340,0:04:42.920
It affected my health, education and way of living.

0:04:42.920,0:04:53.280
When I was in India, I went to a private university where I studied nursing.

0:04:53.280,0:05:02.740
When I was in India, the feeling was so strong that it affected my subjects

0:05:02.740,0:05:05.020
and I could not concentrate on my course anymore.

0:05:05.020,0:05:16.780
Through the internet, I felt free to communicate with fellow girls like me who had that same spirit.

0:05:16.780,0:05:18.880
How did you get them on the internet - can you explain to us?

0:05:18.880,0:05:20.320
It was my hobby.

0:05:20.320,0:05:24.180
I liked browsing and searching different sites.

0:05:24.180,0:05:28.640
When it came to dating, I only focused on females.

0:05:28.640,0:05:34.780
It was a chatting app or sites for lesbians.

0:05:34.780,0:05:39.400
That was where I logged in and I could chat freely with those people.

0:05:39.400,0:05:42.940
I registered and started communicating there.

0:05:42.940,0:05:46.620
I didn’t communicate through my campus or school.

0:05:46.620,0:05:53.820
Can you tell us how far you went in your association with these friends you found on internet?

0:05:53.820,0:06:03.960
Through the site, I met people who lived near me in the country where I was staying.

0:06:03.960,0:06:09.360
I happened to like one of them and we would go out on dates.

0:06:09.360,0:06:13.820
From there, we started enjoying a relationship.

0:06:13.820,0:06:19.460
How far did you go in the relationship with this lady you found on the internet?

0:06:19.460,0:06:21.640
We went deeper like a normal relationship.

0:06:21.640,0:06:27.520
We became intimate and we even shared naked pictures and love messages.

0:06:27.520,0:06:31.360
Can you tell us what level you were in school?

0:06:31.360,0:06:33.340
It was in my third year.

0:06:33.340,0:06:34.740
In which school?

0:06:34.740,0:06:37.020
I was in my third year of university, studying nursing.

0:06:37.020,0:06:40.340
And you told us earlier that it affected your grades.

0:06:40.340,0:06:43.120
Can you just explain further how your grades were affected?

0:06:43.120,0:06:46.660
What were your grades at school?

0:06:46.660,0:06:55.240
It affected my grades – they were beyond poor.

0:06:55.240,0:06:56.600
They were below average.

0:06:56.600,0:07:00.120
If I read, I would not understand and I would forget.

0:07:00.120,0:07:07.420
I couldn’t focus on my studies and it affected me so much in my grades; I even had carryovers.

0:07:07.420,0:07:11.860
It also affected my practicals and everything.

0:07:11.860,0:07:20.340
How did you finally get delivered of this evil spirit - the spirit of woman?

0:07:20.340,0:07:23.020
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:07:23.020,0:07:26.340
I thank God for my parents.

0:07:26.340,0:07:30.580
My mum really loves God so much.

0:07:30.580,0:07:36.320
Whenever she watched Emmanuel TV and prayed along,

0:07:36.320,0:07:42.440
she would ask us to pray since we had access to the internet.

0:07:42.440,0:07:46.360
We could go to the site and pray along with Emmanuel TV

0:07:46.360,0:07:49.740
because our grades and health were poor.

0:07:49.740,0:07:51.720
So, we watched Emmanuel TV.

0:07:51.720,0:07:58.000
Anytime she asked us to read our Bible and pray, we would just ignore her.

0:07:58.000,0:08:01.460
We would agree to do it but ignore her advice and end up not doing it.

0:08:01.460,0:08:05.480
It affected her as well, especially her health.

0:08:05.480,0:08:10.380
Since I was the first one, I was supposed to control her.

0:08:10.380,0:08:12.200
I was living my own life and didn’t care.

0:08:12.200,0:08:20.860
So, she met bad friends and lived a wayward life – partying, drinking and all of that.

0:08:20.860,0:08:27.400
So, any time your mum called you, your response would give her a hint that something was amiss.

0:08:27.400,0:08:28.780
Yeah.

0:08:28.780,0:08:31.200
What then happened afterwards?

0:08:31.200,0:08:38.640
Whenever she called, I tried to cover up but she would still know being a mother.

0:08:38.640,0:08:45.700
She would call to ask if I prayed and read my Bible and I would respond that we had done so.

0:08:45.700,0:08:48.480
I would tell my mother that I was taking care of my sister

0:08:48.480,0:08:52.020
but she would know that things were not good because our grades were poor.

0:08:52.020,0:08:58.880
Each time our results came out, we would inform our parents and they saw that it was not working out

0:08:58.880,0:09:05.240
and told us we need to come to Nigeria for summer break

0:09:05.240,0:09:09.880
to work things out and come for deliverance and healing.

0:09:09.880,0:09:12.880
Whenever she mentioned that we should come down to Nigeria,

0:09:12.880,0:09:15.760
we would always make excuses.

0:09:15.760,0:09:20.680
She would trick us that we were coming down to Nigeria for a summer vacation.

0:09:20.680,0:09:24.360
We did not know that we were coming down here;

0:09:24.360,0:09:28.240
we thought we were coming for vacation because it was Lagos

0:09:28.240,0:09:30.800
where we would have fun with our family.

0:09:30.800,0:09:34.360
When we came here, we did not know that it was the building of The SCOAN.

0:09:34.360,0:09:40.160
When we came here, we thought the building was nice, like a place for tourists.

0:09:40.160,0:09:48.380
We then remembered that we had seen this place online and on Emmanuel TV.

0:09:48.380,0:09:50.920
We realised that this was where our parents wanted us to come.

0:09:50.920,0:09:57.100
We didn’t want to come here; we were tricked into coming.

0:09:57.100,0:10:01.320
So, at the end of the day you found yourself at the prayer-line section that Sunday.

0:10:01.320,0:10:03.900
Tell us what happened.

0:10:03.900,0:10:11.920
When I was at the prayer section, I did not believe because I was not a spiritual person.

0:10:11.920,0:10:21.040
I thought that it was fun and like a drama but I just accepted it believing I would get what I wanted.

0:10:21.040,0:10:24.940
As the man of God was moving to where I was, people were just falling.

0:10:24.940,0:10:27.980
I thought, “What is going on. This is more than just fun”.

0:10:27.980,0:10:31.680
I did not find it fun anymore because people were falling.

0:10:31.680,0:10:40.100
When the man of God came near me, I was feeling uncomfortable and a lot of heat.

0:10:40.100,0:10:42.500
I was not feeling my usual self.

0:10:42.500,0:10:51.520
I only remembered when the man of God touched me and when I got off the ground.

0:10:51.520,0:10:57.940
I stood up from the ground and wondered what had happened.

0:10:57.940,0:11:00.980
- And that was how you received your deliverance?
- Yes.

0:11:00.980,0:11:06.060
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:11:06.060,0:11:08.600
How many of you went to the prayer-line that day?

0:11:08.600,0:11:10.020
Me and my sister.

0:11:10.020,0:11:12.420
- So, the two of you were delivered that day?
- Yeah.

0:11:12.420,0:11:13.120
Hallelujah!

0:11:13.120,0:11:18.340
Put your hands together once again for Jesus!

0:11:18.340,0:11:22.520
Since that day you received that divine touch, through His anointed one - Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:11:22.520,0:11:25.660
as you were just watching on the screen of your TV...

0:11:25.660,0:11:28.100
We can see when she was at the prayer-line section,

0:11:28.100,0:11:30.540
and after that touch from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:11:30.540,0:11:36.640
the evil spirit was manifesting, and at the end of the day she was delivered,

0:11:36.640,0:11:42.340
removed from that kingdom of darkness, from the captivity of satan and placed into the kingdom of light.

0:11:42.340,0:11:43.700
We give God all the glory.

0:11:43.700,0:11:50.600
Tell us the changes you have seen in yourself, since you received your deliverance.

0:11:50.600,0:11:53.920
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:11:53.920,0:11:58.140
After my deliverance, I became my normal self again.

0:11:58.140,0:12:05.240
When I saw what had happened, I realised that this was the cause of my problem.

0:12:05.240,0:12:14.840
God took away the ‘poor and lame’ brain and put a brighter and smarter brain inside of me.

0:12:14.840,0:12:20.180
Whenever I read, it is like a magnet, it just stays there.

0:12:20.180,0:12:25.840
My grades were picking up and I was not even reading much.

0:12:25.840,0:12:33.820
Before, I needed to read for about four hours and about seven text books but now, I hardly read.

0:12:33.820,0:12:39.860
God has given me guidance on how to read.

0:12:39.860,0:12:50.260
We heard from the sister that before she received that deliverance, she spent hours reading,

0:12:50.260,0:12:53.120
but at the end of the day there were low grades.

0:12:53.120,0:12:58.060
But immediately after she received that deliverance, she now has a "magnetic" brain.

0:12:58.060,0:13:04.040
Anything she reads just gets stuck there and her grades improved radically.

0:13:04.040,0:13:05.700
That is indeed a radical transformation.

0:13:05.700,0:13:10.980
Let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:13:10.980,0:13:18.160
What about your social life - the feeling you used to have towards women like yourself?

0:13:18.160,0:13:23.720
How is that, now that you have received your deliverance?

0:13:23.720,0:13:33.020
After my deliverance, I went back and those friends I had before were avoiding me.

0:13:33.020,0:13:35.020
Who? Mention those friends.

0:13:35.020,0:13:39.840
Those friends that had the same spirit of woman.

0:13:39.840,0:13:46.420
I think they saw something in me because even if I greeted them, it was as if I was an outcast.

0:13:46.420,0:13:49.380
I was thinking of how I was going to tell them one by one

0:13:49.380,0:13:52.960
that I was not going to associate with them anymore but God just helped me with that.

0:13:52.960,0:13:56.020
It was as if He put a mask on me that they could not recognise me.

0:13:56.020,0:13:59.800
That was how I saw myself because they would just find their way out.

0:13:59.800,0:14:00.800
Hallelujah!

0:14:00.800,0:14:06.480
That really proves that you have been taken out of this kingdom of darkness.

0:14:06.480,0:14:14.440
That evil spirit that was in you, that linked you with others having the same spirit, has been removed.

0:14:14.440,0:14:17.760
You can see that you are now a changed person.

0:14:17.760,0:14:21.960
God always gives us that evidence, proof to believe in Him.

0:14:21.960,0:14:25.040
We give God all the glory for your deliverance.

0:14:25.040,0:14:30.580
Before we go on to listen to your sister, we just want you to explain one or two things,

0:14:30.580,0:14:33.320
because we can see a board next to you.

0:14:33.320,0:14:37.160
You said that before your deliverance you had like a dull brain.

0:14:37.160,0:14:42.340
Your grades were so poor and you didn't have any hope of graduating from the university.

0:14:42.340,0:14:45.980
But after your deliverance you told us what God has done with regard to your education.

0:14:45.980,0:14:49.720
Explain to us what we are seeing on the board next to you.

0:14:49.720,0:14:55.980
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:14:55.980,0:15:00.680
I don't know how to explain this because I'm so happy.

0:15:00.680,0:15:08.580
I thought that when I came out of school, I would come out with just a pass.

0:15:08.580,0:15:11.840
I thought I would fail or just pass.

0:15:11.840,0:15:17.680
I thank God of Prophet T.B. Joshua whom He used to deliver me from the hands of the devil.

0:15:17.680,0:15:22.940
I came out with a First Class Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Honours).

0:15:22.940,0:15:25.860
Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:15:25.860,0:15:30.160
Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ.

0:15:30.160,0:15:35.340
We see that you came out with First Class Honours in nursing - that is really wonderful.

0:15:35.340,0:15:39.020
This is somebody that was having very low grades.

0:15:39.020,0:15:45.580
Her grades were so poor because of the evil spirit that affected every area of her life.

0:15:45.580,0:15:51.440
It is a proof that when Jesus delivers you, He delivers you completely, effectually

0:15:51.440,0:15:54.380
and every area of your life will be transformed.

0:15:54.380,0:15:56.940
You can see the proof of this in the life of the sister.

0:15:56.940,0:16:01.700
She has shown us the results of her studies in India;

0:16:01.700,0:16:04.880
she came out with first class honours in nursing.

0:16:04.880,0:16:06.240
Hallelujah!

0:16:06.240,0:16:08.800
What are the other documents we are seeing next to it?

0:16:08.800,0:16:23.640
The next one is my license to practise as a registered Nurse and Midwife.

0:16:23.640,0:16:25.860
Hallelujah! We give God all the glory.

0:16:25.860,0:16:32.120
You have said it all, and we give God all the glory for this wonderful thing that He has done in your life.

0:16:32.120,0:16:36.720
Before we go on to hear your own advice, we would like to listen to your sister,

0:16:36.720,0:16:43.760
whom we know that God Almighty has also transformed radically.

0:16:43.760,0:16:47.920
Please tell us your name and your testimony.

0:16:47.920,0:16:51.380
Good Morning everybody!

0:16:51.380,0:16:54.820
Good Morning, children of God!

0:16:54.820,0:16:58.360
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:16:58.360,0:17:03.980
My name is Henrietta Anyama.

0:17:03.980,0:17:08.520
The person standing beside me is my elder sister.

0:17:08.520,0:17:13.860
Don’t get confused about the size.

0:17:13.860,0:17:16.360
She has said it all.

0:17:16.360,0:17:18.980
She is not the type that talks.

0:17:18.980,0:17:21.680
I am the mouth organ in the house.

0:17:21.680,0:17:25.520
Let me perform my own part.

0:17:25.520,0:17:36.900
My life before I received salvation was totally something I would not like to think about

0:17:36.900,0:17:41.580
or want to go back to for any reason.

0:17:41.580,0:17:47.300
Our lives in India -

0:17:47.300,0:17:52.920
and even before we travelled – we hardly went to church.

0:17:52.920,0:17:59.640
Despite my mother being a prayer warrior and my father being grounded in the things of God,

0:17:59.640,0:18:11.520
there was no push or morale to talk about God or anything related to church.

0:18:11.520,0:18:16.300
I didn’t go to church or read my Bible; I didn’t even have a Bible.

0:18:16.300,0:18:19.600
It was back in 2014 when I came to The SCOAN that I got my first Bible

0:18:19.600,0:18:23.480
and my mum bought it for me.

0:18:23.480,0:18:31.660
My life in school was a wayward life.

0:18:31.660,0:18:56.240
I smoked, drank anything and hang out with girls, not the ones that would tell me about God.

0:18:56.240,0:19:02.220
This problem really affected me but academically when you have the grace of God,

0:19:02.220,0:19:07.140
God would always be giving you signs to come back to Him.

0:19:07.140,0:19:10.620
Academically, God was always there for me.

0:19:10.620,0:19:19.440
My wayward life was really affecting me, giving me depression – I could not concentrate.

0:19:19.440,0:19:35.340
I knew that if I had died, I would not even be a step from that road that would take me to Heaven.

0:19:35.340,0:19:40.360
After the deliverance, I know I am a better person and I can take two more steps

0:19:40.360,0:19:42.260
and I would be on my way to Heaven.

0:19:42.260,0:19:50.900
It is a continuous one; it has not ended.

0:19:50.900,0:19:55.740
My sister could not control me because she was doing her own and I was doing my own.

0:19:55.740,0:19:57.300
Everybody was on their own.

0:19:57.300,0:20:01.400
If our mum called us, she would say that the man of God was praying.

0:20:01.400,0:20:02.940
I would ask, “Which man of God?”

0:20:02.940,0:20:04.060
She would reply, “Prophet T.B. Joshua”.

0:20:04.060,0:20:05.620
I would say, “We don’t hear about him here”.

0:20:05.620,0:20:10.140
She replied that it was Emmanuel TV and that we should log onto the internet.

0:20:10.140,0:20:13.180
I told her that we did not have a subscription for the internet.

0:20:13.180,0:20:16.340
When the Prophet would be praying for the viewers,

0:20:16.340,0:20:19.280
that is the time she would call us and put it on loud speaker.

0:20:19.280,0:20:23.440
We would be like, “Amen. Yes, Lord! Amen”.

0:20:23.440,0:20:31.820
When she ended the call, my sister would be wondering what was wrong with our mother.

0:20:31.820,0:20:37.980
Can you tell us what finally pulled you out of that, and today you are a living testimony?

0:20:37.980,0:20:46.800
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:20:46.800,0:20:50.900
I thank God for my mother so much.

0:20:50.900,0:20:54.560
I thank God that she was the one who gave birth to me.

0:20:54.560,0:21:01.520
It happened in 2014, when she asked us to come home.

0:21:01.520,0:21:04.160
Holiday time is the time you have fun.

0:21:04.160,0:21:09.720
How can you come to Nigeria and be caged and you don’t have freedom?

0:21:09.720,0:21:17.920
In 2014, she asked us to come home and it was like she was dragging us back to Nigeria.

0:21:17.920,0:21:20.280
What do you mean by being caged here in Nigeria?

0:21:20.280,0:21:23.560
You mean that your parents... - explain what you meant by that.

0:21:23.560,0:21:27.340
Being caged means you don’t have freedom of your own.

0:21:27.340,0:21:31.420
When you are at home, you have to be a good girl.

0:21:31.420,0:21:35.820
You can’t have bad friends or go out.

0:21:35.820,0:21:41.700
If it is 5pm at my place, you are not going anywhere.

0:21:41.700,0:21:46.300
My father will say, you are a girl and you have to stay at home.

0:21:46.300,0:21:48.680
You can’t have friends that you would go and drink with.

0:21:48.680,0:21:53.000
Where would you go and drink when everybody knows you are the daughter of this person?

0:21:53.000,0:21:57.500
You would be caged but over there, nobody knows your identity,

0:21:57.500,0:22:00.660
so you are free to do whatever thing you want to do.

0:22:00.660,0:22:03.540
I was free to do whatever thing I wanted to do.

0:22:03.540,0:22:11.960
Coming home to Nigeria was going to cut off that freedom – that was the cage I meant.

0:22:11.960,0:22:16.280
My mother asked us to come home and we came home.

0:22:16.280,0:22:23.020
We heard about Lagos and how there is a beach and cool places where you can hang out.

0:22:23.020,0:22:26.720
My mother said that we were coming to Lagos.

0:22:26.720,0:22:30.140
She even made sure that the flight would land in Lagos.

0:22:30.140,0:22:38.120
I prepared my dressing for adventure – the way I was dressed that day!

0:22:38.120,0:22:44.460
When we got here, the environment was cool, like a foreign place.

0:22:44.460,0:22:47.660
I was like, yes, they are stepping up the game.

0:22:47.660,0:22:54.080
The next thing, I saw one picture that looked like something I had seen on Emmanuel TV.

0:22:54.080,0:22:58.900
I said, “This woman, so she has brought me here”.

0:22:58.900,0:23:02.100
I said that I would comply.

0:23:02.100,0:23:15.020
We were here and we were lucky we got on the prayer line and every miracle started from there.

0:23:15.020,0:23:20.820
The miracle happened when the man of God prayed for me

0:23:20.820,0:23:28.180
and it took three people to help me stand up because I had gained weight.

0:23:28.180,0:23:31.460
I stood up and that was the only thing I noticed.

0:23:31.460,0:23:36.280
There was no pain but I felt I was being lifted from the ground.

0:23:36.280,0:23:43.120
I felt lighter, more cool and differently immediately.

0:23:43.120,0:23:50.640
I started seeing things from a different perspective, other than what I used to see before.

0:23:50.640,0:23:55.520
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:23:55.520,0:24:02.000
Tell us other changes you have seen, since you received your deliverance.

0:24:02.000,0:24:07.540
As I am now, just one shot of vodka and I would want to sleep.

0:24:07.540,0:24:11.880
It would be like a sleeping tablet for the next 24 hours.

0:24:11.880,0:24:17.920
Before, no matter what they mixed, I would drink and still stand.

0:24:17.920,0:24:23.220
Now, if I just taste it, I would become tipsy.

0:24:23.220,0:24:28.260
That was a sign that the brain that was used to drinking was no longer there,

0:24:28.260,0:24:31.400
that brain had come out and a different brain is in my head.

0:24:31.400,0:24:35.960
After our deliverance, we went back to school because we were in our third year.

0:24:35.960,0:24:38.760
We went back to complete our final year.

0:24:38.760,0:24:42.760
Everything was different, our friends -

0:24:42.760,0:24:47.860
those girls who clubbed, none of them came close to me again.

0:24:47.860,0:24:52.620
It was as if something had happened to me, as if I had another face.

0:24:52.620,0:24:55.920
Even when I talked to them, they would give me attitude.

0:24:55.920,0:25:00.740
I said to myself, “Let them go; they are the ones who will lose not me”.

0:25:00.740,0:25:07.040
Regarding our grades at school – our exam time was getting close and before,

0:25:07.040,0:25:12.160
when the exam got close, we would want to be very close to our books and read

0:25:12.160,0:25:15.860
but when the exam got close after my deliverance,

0:25:15.860,0:25:20.840
I wasn’t even getting close to my books because I believed that God had done it already.

0:25:20.840,0:25:25.140
I did not put in so much human effort as before.

0:25:25.140,0:25:29.500
I am a brand new Ebere.

0:25:29.500,0:25:32.540
What about this life you used to live on campus

0:25:32.540,0:25:37.000
because you said you went back to the same school after your deliverance?

0:25:37.000,0:25:40.160
Can you tell us; when you found yourself in that same school -

0:25:40.160,0:25:46.960
how were you able to disassociate yourself from those bad friends you were involved with before?

0:25:46.960,0:25:51.060
When I got back there, they all went away.

0:25:51.060,0:25:53.900
They weren’t coming close to me anymore.

0:25:53.900,0:25:58.300
When you take out a space in your life, you have to fill it with another thing.

0:25:58.300,0:26:00.680
I wasn’t going to church.

0:26:00.680,0:26:03.480
The things of God did not interest me so much.

0:26:03.480,0:26:11.220
I joined a living church and became a part of the choir there.

0:26:11.220,0:26:13.940
When I sang hymns, people would be crying.

0:26:13.940,0:26:15.720
Watch the screen of your TV.

0:26:15.720,0:26:21.920
On the left-hand side, we can see when she was being delivered,

0:26:21.920,0:26:24.480
couple of years ago, when she came to the prayer line-section.

0:26:24.480,0:26:28.120
We can see the evil spirit in her manifesting.

0:26:28.120,0:26:32.880
That was when the evil spirit was cast out and you can see her right on the floor.

0:26:32.880,0:26:37.180
The evil spirit was totally cast out and that was how she became a changed person.

0:26:37.180,0:26:40.320
We give glory to God Almighty!

0:26:40.320,0:26:42.420
Having watched this clip, we want to ask you;

0:26:42.420,0:26:48.620
you said that academically, spiritually, even your social life was totally transformed...

0:26:48.620,0:26:51.740
Can you tell us in what other way did God Almighty bless you,

0:26:51.740,0:26:56.040
before you travelled back to India to complete your studies?

0:26:56.040,0:26:59.380
Number one, I had the opportunity to get delivered.

0:26:59.380,0:27:04.900
Number two, I had the grace to get the Morning Water and the Morning Sticker

0:27:04.900,0:27:11.900
that is anointed by God through Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:27:11.900,0:27:16.860
What we did not expect happened, the man of God supported us financially.

0:27:16.860,0:27:18.820
The fresh foundation that he laid

0:27:18.820,0:27:22.200
was what brought about the good result you are seeing there.

0:27:22.200,0:27:24.200
It was not me but God.

0:27:24.200,0:27:31.080
All throughout the exams, as we were writing, all of us believed that we were going to make it

0:27:31.080,0:27:34.200
because they saw the enthusiasm in me.

0:27:34.200,0:27:37.800
Each time we submitted the paper, I would spray the Morning Water on them.

0:27:37.800,0:27:42.440
We were only allowed to go in with a pen and paper but my Morning Water was always here.

0:27:42.440,0:27:45.180
When I brought it out, they asked why I was having it.

0:27:45.180,0:27:49.960
I replied that it was my Morning Water that I used for prayer.

0:27:49.960,0:27:56.120
I took it and sprayed it on each paper, from day one to the last day of the exams.

0:27:56.120,0:28:00.500
I sprayed every paper as we were submitting them.

0:28:00.500,0:28:02.160
Praise God!

0:28:02.160,0:28:03.480
Hallelujah!

0:28:03.480,0:28:07.940
And how was your grade, after you wrote your final exam,

0:28:07.940,0:28:11.160
according to what we are seeing on the board next to you?

0:28:11.160,0:28:20.140
I was not expecting anything less than First Class because I knew God was with me.

0:28:20.140,0:28:22.960
God did it. He perfected everything.

0:28:22.960,0:28:24.120
Hallelujah!

0:28:24.120,0:28:26.760
Let us put our hands together for Jesus!

0:28:26.760,0:28:30.840
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:28:30.840,0:28:34.000
Can you just explain the documents to us?

0:28:34.000,0:28:40.420
After everything, the results came out and I got Pass-1 Division.

0:28:40.420,0:28:46.340
Now, I have a BSc Honours in Nursing – a registered Nurse and Midwife

0:28:46.340,0:28:49.080
at the Nursing Council in New Delhi, India.

0:28:49.080,0:28:50.280
Thank God!

0:28:50.280,0:28:52.260
This was our graduation picture.

0:28:52.260,0:28:57.660
This picture was taken at the final practical we had.

0:28:57.660,0:29:01.880
This is me - very happy because I knew God did it.

0:29:01.880,0:29:04.520
This is my sister.

0:29:04.520,0:29:10.820
This is me and my sister on the day of graduation.

0:29:10.820,0:29:16.600
This was our first delivery in the practical exams.

0:29:16.600,0:29:22.320
You have seen a lot of proofs of what God has done in the life of these two sisters.

0:29:22.320,0:29:25.540
We give God all the glory.

0:29:25.540,0:29:31.460
As a youth, listen to your parents because they will never deceive you.

0:29:31.460,0:29:33.320
They mean well for you.

0:29:33.320,0:29:37.940
Let us hear a word of advice from your sister.

0:29:37.940,0:29:40.580
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:29:40.580,0:29:44.040
My advice is for you to stick to God.

0:29:44.040,0:29:50.460
As a youth, this is the time for you to come close to God.

0:29:50.460,0:29:51.480
Hallelujah!

0:29:51.480,0:29:54.140
We have heard a wonderful advice from the two sisters.

0:29:54.140,0:29:56.880
We just want to advise you as well. Now that God Almighty has set you free,

0:29:56.880,0:30:00.220
taken you out of the kingdom of darkness and placed you in the kingdom of light,

0:30:00.220,0:30:02.980
all this you have received is for the salvation of your soul.

0:30:02.980,0:30:04.980
Make God's Word the standard for your life,

0:30:04.980,0:30:09.320
meaning that no state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.

0:30:09.320,0:30:16.000
Holy are you Lord

0:30:16.000,0:30:24.580
All creation calls you Lord

0:30:24.580,0:30:31.660
Worthy is Your name

0:30:31.660,0:30:38.820
We worship Your majesty

0:30:38.820,0:30:43.180
Awesome God

0:30:43.180,0:30:46.640
You are my Father

0:30:46.640,0:30:49.820
You alone

0:30:49.820,0:30:55.160
Mighty are Your miracles

0:30:55.160,0:30:57.760
Just live in me

0:30:57.760,0:30:59.560
Stay in me

0:30:59.560,0:31:01.260
Hallelujah!
