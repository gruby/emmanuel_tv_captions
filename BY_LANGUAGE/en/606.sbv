The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:03.140,0:00:05.600
You may be seated, thank you!

0:00:05.600,0:00:08.560
- Hallelujah!
- (Amen.)

0:00:08.560,0:00:11.440
Emmanuel!
(God with us, Matthew 1:23)

0:00:11.440,0:00:15.880
The message that I have for you today is 
'The burden in our spirit'.

0:00:15.880,0:00:23.440
That is; when one is thinking, worried and troubled

0:00:23.440,0:00:29.720
your spirit cannot be free to attract the Spirit of God.

0:00:29.720,0:00:34.940
We cannot be available for God when we are worried.

0:00:34.940,0:00:37.400
Are you with me?

0:00:37.400,0:00:45.180
When you are worried, troubled - 
maybe something is troubling or worrying you,

0:00:45.180,0:00:48.740
you cannot be available for God's Spirit.

0:00:48.740,0:00:54.240
Our spirits are free when we are free.

0:00:54.240,0:01:03.420
This is why in 1 Peter 5:7, when you start reading from verse 7,

0:01:03.420,0:01:20.020
it says, "Your cares, your troubles - to God because He cares for you and He loves you."

0:01:20.020,0:01:30.280
When we are troubled, we cannot be sensitive to the Spirit of God.

0:01:30.280,0:01:34.760
You need a free spirit to pray.

0:01:34.760,0:01:39.280
You need a free spirit to hear from God.

0:01:39.280,0:01:42.680
You need a free spirit to do what?

0:01:42.680,0:01:43.980
To hear from God.

0:01:43.980,0:01:52.860
You cannot hear from God when your spirit is troubled.

0:01:52.860,0:02:00.060
He is the Landlord; He cannot share that apartment with anyone.

0:02:00.060,0:02:07.460
When you say someone is the landlord of a house; you pay house rent to the man.

0:02:07.460,0:02:09.060
He cannot share...,

0:02:09.060,0:02:16.940
He is the landlord, the owner; He doesn't want to share anything.

0:02:16.940,0:02:26.160
He created you - spirit, soul and body.

0:02:26.160,0:02:31.920
Without this free spirit, you cannot 
act upon the Word of God.

0:02:31.920,0:02:39.380
You only hear the Word; you cannot do anything about it.

0:02:39.380,0:02:45.040
You will only hear, "Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Saviour! Jesus is this, Jesus is that..."

0:02:45.040,0:02:50.820
As you hear, it goes this way, when you are troubled.

0:02:50.820,0:02:56.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:56.900,0:03:06.400
The Spirit of God will be released to the degree you stand in reverence,

0:03:06.400,0:03:14.500
in obeying and in honour of His Word.

0:03:14.500,0:03:18.880
The Spirit of God will be released.

0:03:18.880,0:03:24.820
As you honour the Word, the Spirit increases.

0:03:24.820,0:03:27.980
It's like you are being filled.

0:03:27.980,0:03:32.940
You know, as you eat food you get filled.

0:03:32.940,0:03:41.260
The more you eat you get filled...

0:03:41.260,0:03:49.960
You need a free spirit to get along, to act with God.

0:03:49.960,0:03:57.960
Without a free spirit , there is nothing, nothing and nothing...

0:03:57.960,0:04:00.980
So therefore...

0:04:00.980,0:04:10.540
Leave it for God; don't worry yourself.

0:04:10.540,0:04:13.600
- Leave it for what?
- (God.)

0:04:13.600,0:04:18.060
Open 1 Peter chapter 5.

0:04:18.060,0:04:24.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:24.920,0:04:27.740
Chapter 5 verse 7.

0:04:27.740,0:04:37.280
"Give all your worries and cares to God for He cares about you."

0:04:37.280,0:04:39.440
Listen to that.

0:04:39.440,0:04:45.460
Give all your what?

0:04:45.460,0:04:57.580
All your worries and cares; cares mean trouble, burden - whatever you call it, it is a foolish thing.

0:04:57.580,0:05:00.760
... for He cares for you.

0:05:00.760,0:05:08.980
This is why when you want to open you Bible to read, its time to give all your what?

0:05:08.980,0:05:11.520
Troubles.

0:05:11.520,0:05:18.460
Give all your cares and troubles to God.

0:05:18.460,0:05:25.900
That is, leave all - whatever is bothering you, worrying you.

0:05:25.900,0:05:35.780
When you don't; you will read and you will not able to obey what you read.

0:05:35.780,0:05:42.180
You will read the Bible as if you are reading literature, a book.

0:05:42.180,0:05:46.800
You know when you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit

0:05:46.800,0:05:55.020
but any other book outside Bible, when you are reading them, you are reading about event.

0:05:55.020,0:06:05.520
Some will say, "Is that actually possible to give all worries? How will one just overlook his trouble?

0:06:05.520,0:06:07.600
Is it actually possible?"

0:06:07.600,0:06:10.820
Yes! That is actually why God gave you discretion.

0:06:10.820,0:06:14.880
You can choose to cry, you can choose to laugh.

0:06:14.880,0:06:18.420
You can choose to dance, you can choose not to.

0:06:18.420,0:06:24.380
You can choose to leave here, walk out of this place and you can choose to sit.

0:06:24.380,0:06:26.160
You can choose to stand...

0:06:26.160,0:06:31.580
This is why Jesus met this man at the pool of Bethesda.

0:06:31.580,0:06:34.760
He said, "What can I do for you?"

0:06:34.760,0:06:37.660
He knew the problem the man was facing.

0:06:37.660,0:06:43.020
He was so sick that he could not jump into the pool.

0:06:43.020,0:06:49.440
He needed someone to help him to jump into the pool.

0:06:49.440,0:06:54.540
But Jesus knew his problem but he said still, "What can I do for you?"

0:06:54.540,0:06:56.860
He knew that he might have refused him.

0:06:56.860,0:06:58.900
He knew he might have disagreed with Him.

0:06:58.900,0:07:01.820
He knew that he might have made Him walk away.

0:07:01.820,0:07:08.120
"- What can I do for you?
- Yes, I needed someone to carry me to the pool.

0:07:08.120,0:07:12.760
... each time the water is stirred - that is turning.

0:07:12.760,0:07:19.060
But here I am, so sick, no one to carry me to the pool.

0:07:19.060,0:07:21.180
- Can I help?"

0:07:21.180,0:07:25.300
He said, "Yes, if you will."

0:07:25.300,0:07:30.020
Its not all up to God; certainly, it is not all up to you.

0:07:30.020,0:07:38.660
It takes you genuine willingness and God's ability to achieve something.

0:07:38.660,0:07:48.360
You can choose to overlook everything and open your Bible and read.

0:07:48.360,0:07:53.740
Don't look for the solution of the trouble you have, in the Bible.

0:07:53.740,0:07:57.240
Read Bible for the salvation of you soul.

0:07:57.240,0:08:01.560
Don't be searching for solution of your problem.

0:08:01.560,0:08:07.480
"I am sick. I want to see where Jesus healed the sick person in the Bible";

0:08:07.480,0:08:11.920
and you start searching for that - No!

0:08:11.920,0:08:18.660
"I am poor, I want to know who was poor like me in the Bible and was revived."

0:08:18.660,0:08:22.460
No, the Bible is not for that.

0:08:22.460,0:08:26.640
Therefore, when you want to sleep, don't open your Bible because of your trouble.

0:08:26.640,0:08:34.080
In the night, when you are about to sleep, you open the Bible to find something against your enemy.

0:08:34.080,0:08:38.620
You want to fire your enemy; you open Psalms 35, and you read.

0:08:38.620,0:08:46.380
After reading you place it under your pillow.

0:08:46.380,0:08:53.400
When your enemy comes, he will wake you up and say, "Come. Carry the thing you put under your pillow."

0:08:53.400,0:08:57.960
You will carry it, and he will use the same Bible to flog you.

0:08:57.960,0:09:03.000
By the time you wake up you say, " Ah! Does it mean that the bible is not the Word of God?

0:09:03.000,0:09:06.180
Why does the enemy use this Word to beat me?"

0:09:06.180,0:09:09.000
No. You make Bible work.

0:09:09.000,0:09:12.240
Bible itself cannot work; you make the Bible work.

0:09:12.240,0:09:15.220
Tell your neighbor, "I make it work".

0:09:15.220,0:09:17.200
You make it work.

0:09:17.200,0:09:20.220
The Bible itself cannot just work.

0:09:20.220,0:09:28.240
You make it work, or not to work.

0:09:28.240,0:09:35.000
It's the library of apostles put together.

0:09:35.000,0:09:36.240
Hallelujah

0:09:36.240,0:09:38.660
Thank you, rise up...

0:09:38.660,0:09:42.040
Hallelujah!

0:09:42.040,0:09:46.820
Ask for a free spirit.

0:09:46.820,0:09:52.580
You know I told you; meditation reveals the burden in our spirit.

0:09:52.580,0:10:00.640
Meditation exposes the burden in your spirit, the burden in you, the worry.

0:10:00.640,0:10:05.120
This is why we have faith bracelet.

0:10:05.120,0:10:11.520
When you meditate, "Take more of me, give me more of You", before you know it, the burden is gone.

0:10:11.520,0:10:15.340
You will begin to think of Jesus; then, you can pray.

0:10:15.340,0:10:19.460
You find joy, naturally;

0:10:19.460,0:10:21.400
it comes naturally,

0:10:21.400,0:10:27.020
It comes spontaneously.

0:10:27.020,0:10:32.300
Spontaneously - just naturally the joy comes.

0:10:32.300,0:10:38.300
Joy is not created by you and I.

0:10:38.300,0:10:41.220
It originates with God.

0:10:41.220,0:10:43.200
Joy!

0:10:43.200,0:10:48.640
"Take more of me; give me more of you..."

0:10:48.640,0:10:54.100
By the time you meditate this, that burden - worry is gone;

0:10:54.100,0:10:58.280
you would feel joy - a kind of inner joy.

0:10:58.280,0:11:02.840
That is the time to pray.

0:11:02.840,0:11:05.740
Are you with me?

0:11:05.740,0:11:12.420
This is why we call meditation a visit with God.

0:11:12.420,0:11:15.280
What is meditation?

0:11:15.280,0:11:19.000
Meditation in Gods Word is what?

0:11:19.000,0:11:20.560
A visit with God.

0:11:20.560,0:11:25.120
Meditation in Gods Word is a visit with God.

0:11:25.120,0:11:26.740
Now you are happy.

0:11:26.740,0:11:31.340
It does not mean that in coming hours there will be nothing troubling you.

0:11:31.340,0:11:33.760
You are a human, since you have flesh.

0:11:33.760,0:11:39.120
You will continue to have something troubling you, but you will continue to overcome.

0:11:39.120,0:11:41.520
Are you with me?

0:11:41.520,0:11:46.540
It is not that you will not have something troubling you in the future - no!

0:11:46.540,0:11:48.500
No, it is not in the Bible.

0:11:48.500,0:11:51.340
In this world there will be what?

0:11:51.340,0:11:57.380
There will be trouble!

0:11:57.380,0:12:08.540
"In this world there will be trouble. Cheer up; I have overcome" (John 16:33).

0:12:08.540,0:12:15.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:15.620,0:12:21.700
This is why He said, "I pray your faith will not fail."

0:12:21.700,0:12:30.780
If He said, "your faith will not fail", it means there will be trouble that will tempt your faith.

0:12:30.780,0:12:36.180
"I pray your faith will not fail"; it means 
there will be time our faith will be shaken.

0:12:36.180,0:12:46.020
As you continue to live in this world, something will continue to come to threaten your faith.

0:12:46.020,0:12:54.160
And that thing helps to grow our relationship.

0:12:54.160,0:12:57.860
It is an instrument to grow our relationship.

0:12:57.860,0:13:02.360
That is the time you will see the need of God more.

0:13:02.360,0:13:06.060
- The need of who? 
- (God) - the  more.

0:13:06.060,0:13:11.240
It strengthens our desire and our determination for God.

0:13:11.240,0:13:14.780
It strengthens our what?

0:13:14.780,0:13:19.060
Our desire and determination for God.

0:13:19.060,0:13:22.680
It makes us to see the need for God.

0:13:22.680,0:13:30.040
He has prayed for us that our faith would not fail; that is the prayer He left behind.

0:13:30.040,0:13:34.100
He said to His disciple and you are one of them.

0:13:34.100,0:13:38.280
He said, "I pray that your faith will not fail".

0:13:38.280,0:13:47.660
It means your faith will be tested.

0:13:47.660,0:13:52.920
Ask your neighbor what is testing your faith, right now?

0:13:52.920,0:13:54.560
Ask you neighbor.

0:13:54.560,0:13:56.840
(What is testing your faith, right now?)

0:13:56.840,0:14:03.860
Remember, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:14:03.860,0:14:08.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:08.760,0:14:14.420
That means that what you are going through - God is aware.

0:14:14.420,0:14:22.440
It has been prophesied, you will go through them.

0:14:22.440,0:14:30.120
But, it will not impair you but improve you.

0:14:30.120,0:14:43.300
It has been prophesied by our Lord Jesus Christ, "My disciples, My followers will go through this".

0:14:43.300,0:14:48.120
It has been prophesied.

0:14:48.120,0:14:52.320
If you are one of the followers, it will not impair you.

0:14:52.320,0:14:59.020
But if you are not of the followers, it will impair you.

0:14:59.020,0:15:05.080
If you are one of the followers, it will improve you - whatever you go through.

0:15:05.080,0:15:09.000
There can be no promotion without test.

0:15:09.000,0:15:15.880
There can be no improvement without test.

0:15:15.880,0:15:19.880
And what is your test?
What is my test?

0:15:19.880,0:15:24.300
What are you going through? 
What am I going through?

0:15:24.300,0:15:29.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:29.840,0:15:35.300
When it is time to go up, it is time to be tested.

0:15:35.300,0:15:41.920
Oh, I'm talking to you.

0:15:41.920,0:15:45.660
When it is time to go up, it is time to what?

0:15:45.660,0:15:51.300
(To be tested.)

0:15:51.300,0:15:55.720
He said, "I pray" - it was a prayer offered for you

0:15:55.720,0:16:06.240
This means that whatever you are going through has been prophesied.

0:16:06.240,0:16:08.020
- Hallelujah!
- (Amen!)

0:16:08.020,0:16:19.000
So, it has been prophesied that this and that will happen.

0:16:19.000,0:16:24.720
Some things will be changeable and many will not be changeable.

0:16:24.720,0:16:32.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:32.600,0:16:35.640
It is written.

0:16:35.640,0:16:46.360
It gladdens in my heart, anytime I read; when Jesus said...

0:16:46.360,0:16:51.280
He is aware of your cares and your trouble.

0:16:51.280,0:17:01.020
He says, your cares and worries - leave it to God, because He cares about you,

0:17:01.020,0:17:03.520
he is concerned about you.

0:17:03.520,0:17:09.540
Jesus loves you just as He loves every apostle.

0:17:09.540,0:17:15.820
And every apostle in the Bible, read about them,

0:17:15.820,0:17:20.320
everyone had their own what?

0:17:20.320,0:17:22.900
Challenges.

0:17:22.900,0:17:26.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:26.420,0:17:31.480
And their challenges strengthened their desire.

0:17:31.480,0:17:39.060
The apostles' challenges strengthened their desire.

0:17:39.060,0:17:46.840
They paid the supreme price to bring the Gospel you and I enjoy today.

0:17:46.840,0:17:51.820
What price have you paid?

0:17:51.820,0:17:56.700
I pray your faith will not fail, in Jesus name.

0:17:56.700,0:17:58.240
(Amen!)

0:17:58.240,0:18:04.280
