0:00:00.120,0:00:05.920
The New Morning Water released the presence, the power and the glory of Jesus Christ

0:00:05.920,0:00:09.960
into the lives of all who received even just a drop of it.

0:00:09.960,0:00:16.000
Demonic beings, hidden sicknesses and the plan of the devil against the lives of so many people

0:00:16.000,0:00:20.620
were broken and cast out in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:20.620,0:00:25.260
A glorious liberty began to replace years of oppression and bondage.

0:00:25.260,0:00:32.800
Holy relaxation replaced the years of tension and pressure God's people had endured through the ministration.

0:00:32.800,0:00:37.400
Watch the mighty deliverance of this woman through the New Morning Water.

0:00:37.400,0:00:39.520
Holy Ghost fire all over her body !

0:00:39.520,0:00:41.480
Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !

0:00:41.480,0:00:43.360
Now, speak out! Who are you ?

0:00:43.360,0:00:47.000
Who are you ? Speak out !

0:00:47.000,0:00:52.260
She came to me because she wanted to give birth.

0:00:52.260,0:00:58.540
That's why I entered her - she had to give birth. I entered her through her culture.

0:00:58.540,0:01:06.040
She begged me. She said, "I want to give birth. Please, have mercy on me".

0:01:06.040,0:01:07.540
Who are you ?

0:01:07.560,0:01:10.940
She has to slaughter a goat.

0:01:10.940,0:01:15.440
I am the spirit from the mother.

0:01:15.440,0:01:16.280
You evil spirit !

0:01:16.280,0:01:17.680
You can't destroy me.

0:01:17.680,0:01:18.960
Listen!

0:01:18.960,0:01:21.700
I have destroyed her family; the family is useless.

0:01:21.700,0:01:23.720
Now listen to me, you evil spirits!

0:01:23.720,0:01:25.620
All of them are useless.

0:01:25.620,0:01:26.860
What are the bad habits?

0:01:26.860,0:01:33.860
She has nothing now; she is a drunkard.

0:01:33.860,0:01:37.160
She is my wife; she is my woman - I made her useless.

0:01:37.160,0:01:40.300
What are the bad habits you have given her?

0:01:40.300,0:01:43.340
She is my woman.

0:01:43.340,0:01:49.620
She drinks and she smokes.

0:01:49.620,0:01:51.980
Anytime she drinks what happens to her ?

0:01:51.980,0:01:57.200
Even if you go to her hotel now, there is more - she bought more.

0:01:57.200,0:02:04.620
She is my woman; you can't take her from me.

0:02:04.620,0:02:06.600
She begged me.

0:02:06.600,0:02:13.440
Listen, in Jesus' name! Any time she smokes and drinks, what happens to her ?

0:02:13.440,0:02:16.140
What happens when she starts drinking and smoking ?

0:02:16.140,0:02:23.760
She goes crazy; she drives - she wouldn't know where she is going.

0:02:23.760,0:02:29.400
She always drives.

0:02:29.400,0:02:32.980
You spirit of drunkenness, what else have you caused this woman to do ?

0:02:32.980,0:02:34.700
What else ? Speak out !

0:02:34.700,0:02:37.380
What else have you caused her to do in her life ?

0:02:37.380,0:02:41.260
Speak out! Fire all over your body, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !

0:02:41.260,0:02:43.500
Spirit of drunkenness, what else have you caused her ?

0:02:43.500,0:02:46.740
What else ? Speak out!

0:02:46.740,0:02:51.040
She smokes - she can smoke 20 boxes a day.

0:02:51.040,0:02:53.120
Then who are you in the body ?

0:02:53.120,0:03:00.360
I'm her man; she stays alone because I take care of her. I give her money.

0:03:00.360,0:03:02.480
I do everything for her; she is my woman.

0:03:02.480,0:03:03.760
Who are you in this body ?

0:03:03.760,0:03:04.820
She is my woman.

0:03:04.820,0:03:05.880
Who are you?

0:03:05.880,0:03:09.480
I am the spirit from her mother. It is because she begged me.

0:03:09.480,0:03:12.820
Okay, for how long have you stayed inside her ?

0:03:12.820,0:03:16.640
She begged me !

0:03:16.640,0:03:18.520
10 years now !

0:03:18.520,0:03:21.360
She is a sangoma. Did she tell you she is a sangoma ?

0:03:21.360,0:03:25.280
She has a shrine house at her mother's place. Did she tell you that ?

0:03:25.280,0:03:27.400
She is a sangoma.

0:03:27.400,0:03:28.680
She has a shrine?

0:03:28.680,0:03:34.520
She went to inyangas for help; non of them - they failed to help her.

0:03:34.520,0:03:38.220
What have you done to her ?

0:03:38.220,0:03:43.160
Did she tell you that she did abortions ?

0:03:43.160,0:03:46.680
She is a sangoma; she used to consult people.

0:03:46.680,0:03:52.500
She has a shrine house; she has everything by her mother's house.

0:03:52.500,0:03:56.340
Okay ! You spirit, it is time for you to leave this body !

0:03:56.340,0:03:57.860
This lady will live !

0:03:57.860,0:03:59.940
I will kill the family.

0:03:59.940,0:04:01.320
You will not kill the family.

0:04:01.320,0:04:04.640
If I'm going out now, I will go to her through one of my friends.

0:04:04.640,0:04:06.580
Now you are leaving!

0:04:06.580,0:04:09.880
And you will never return to that family in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !

0:04:09.880,0:04:13.080
It is time for you to leave this body in the mighty name of Jesus Christ

0:04:13.080,0:04:16.780
Out, in the mighty name of Jesus !

0:04:16.780,0:04:21.620
You are free.

0:04:21.620,0:04:27.840
You are set free through the medium of the New Morning Water in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:04:27.840,0:04:32.960
Now rise up. You're free. Rise up and give thanks to God.

0:04:32.960,0:04:39.640
Jesus Christ has set you free !

0:04:39.640,0:04:43.900
Thank You, Jesus ! Thank You, Lord !

0:04:43.900,0:04:48.480
I've waited so many years for this. Thank You. I had to quit my job to come here.

0:04:48.480,0:04:49.920
Thank You, Jesus !

0:04:49.920,0:04:54.200
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:04:54.200,0:04:56.180
Emmanuel! 
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:04:56.180,0:05:00.400
Thank You, Jesus. I'm healed and free !

0:05:00.400,0:05:05.100
My name is Refilwe. I'm 34 years old. I'm from South Africa.

0:05:05.100,0:05:13.480
The reason that brought me to The SCOAN: It was sangoma spirit - the witch doctor,

0:05:13.480,0:05:17.240
which I trained for in 2012.

0:05:17.240,0:05:23.340
Ok. So just tell us how you got involved in the issue of becoming a sangome.

0:05:23.340,0:05:26.080
What led to you being initiated into this ?

0:05:26.080,0:05:30.920
I had a business before. I was running my own saloon business.

0:05:30.920,0:05:35.400
Things didn't go well, it got messed up.

0:05:35.400,0:05:42.720
So I had to go to a witch doctor for consultation - to tell me what my problem was,

0:05:42.720,0:05:48.920
why my business was now failing and why my life was not in order.

0:05:48.920,0:05:58.740
After going to the witch doctor for consultation, she told me that I must train to become a sangoma.

0:05:58.740,0:06:05.120
That I had a gift in healing people so I must become a sangoma.

0:06:05.120,0:06:12.580
I then asked what the procedure was for becoming a sangoma, what had to be done.

0:06:12.580,0:06:17.500
He said to me, "Ok, you must give a sacrifice before coming for the training.

0:06:17.500,0:06:19.260
You must slaughter a goat

0:06:19.260,0:06:25.200
and then you will tell your ancestors that you'll train to become a sangoma.

0:06:25.200,0:06:31.340
Then I went to tell my parents that I went to see a witch doctor

0:06:31.340,0:06:35.060
because of in my family they didn't worship ancestors.

0:06:35.060,0:06:36.980
They used to go to church.

0:06:36.980,0:06:42.020
I told them, "The traditional healer told me this is a matter of life and death.

0:06:42.020,0:06:44.780
I must do it in order to have money.

0:06:44.780,0:06:49.400
And you guys (parents) are going to have money and benefit from this.

0:06:49.400,0:06:53.640
So I'm going to heal you. It will benefit the family".

0:06:53.640,0:06:57.240
So, they accepted it. I slaughtered a chicken.

0:06:57.240,0:07:03.760
Then I begged my ancestors, "This is my offering, I need to go for the training now".

0:07:03.760,0:07:09.820
Then I went for my training. I paid money - a lot of money, not a small amount of money.

0:07:09.820,0:07:13.360
It cost more than fifty thousand to do the training

0:07:13.360,0:07:18.100
because from time to time, you must offer sacrifices, you must slaughter.

0:07:18.100,0:07:21.380
All the time you have to offer sacrifices.

0:07:21.380,0:07:31.360
During my training, they taught me how to read bones, and how to use charms.

0:07:31.360,0:07:37.720
They taught me about different charms like this is for marriage. This is for business. This is for work.

0:07:37.720,0:07:46.300
If a person has a problem, struggling to get a job, you must use this charm, so that this person can get a job.

0:07:46.300,0:07:53.580
When you graduate, you go to the water.

0:07:53.580,0:08:00.300
We went with a goat there. When they slaughter the goat, you must open your mouth.

0:08:00.300,0:08:05.980
You drink the goat's blood and then someone will pour it on your body.

0:08:05.980,0:08:11.020
And then you talk to the spirit of the water and go inside the water.

0:08:11.020,0:08:17.940
There is an underworld secret which not everybody knows about. You go inside the water.

0:08:17.940,0:08:20.400
It's a dry land and you sit there.

0:08:20.400,0:08:26.980
That's how you receive your things, your bones, your ancestors' clothes, and your beads.

0:08:26.980,0:08:29.860
After the water graduation...

0:08:29.860,0:08:38.460
Then I went home. When you go home, then you graduate. That's how you become a sangoma.

0:08:38.460,0:08:41.440
You are ready to heal people. You are ready to consult people.

0:08:41.440,0:08:49.080
People come to you with different types of illnesses, problems in their lives.

0:08:49.080,0:08:53.780
So how did you begin to practice as a sangoma after this initiation ?

0:08:53.780,0:08:57.840
After your graduation, you'd start to practise.

0:08:57.840,0:09:05.720
You burn the essence which will attract people to come to you for consultation.

0:09:05.720,0:09:10.620
Then you stow your bones, you read the bones while the people are coming to your shrine.

0:09:10.620,0:09:14.060
Okay, sister, we want you to explain very clearly to us.

0:09:14.060,0:09:19.480
What you are saying right now - the confession you are giving - is your own personal experience.

0:09:19.480,0:09:25.880
You personally went through this initiation process, and began practicing as a sangoma

0:09:25.880,0:09:32.700
after you drank the blood of this goat, went into the water to be initiated, to collect the bones and other items

0:09:32.700,0:09:37.920
that you'd use to practice and that's how you started work as a sangoma. Is that right?

0:09:37.920,0:09:40.240
Yes, that's right. That's correct.

0:09:40.240,0:09:48.000
I started training - initiating like consulting people.

0:09:48.000,0:09:55.840
Give us an example of how you would go about it when people would approach you?

0:09:55.840,0:10:02.800
Okay, people would come to my  forefathers' house for consultation.

0:10:02.800,0:10:06.060
I would then take them to the shrine house.

0:10:06.060,0:10:11.360
Then they would tell me, "My name is so-and-so".

0:10:11.360,0:10:16.200
They wouldn't tell me their problem because I had to figure out what their problem was.

0:10:16.200,0:10:20.880
I had to throw down the bones and tell them what the problem was,

0:10:20.880,0:10:25.940
what brought them there. Then I would tell them, "This is the problem. You are facing this and this".

0:10:25.940,0:10:31.820
In order for me to tell them, I had to first talk to my ancestors,

0:10:31.820,0:10:40.300
"My ancestors, I have this person so and so. He has come here to consult. Please assist me".

0:10:40.300,0:10:43.900
I would hear voices in my ears.

0:10:43.900,0:10:51.160
Then they would start to tell me, "Okay, tell the bones that this is the problem of that person.

0:10:51.160,0:10:57.460
This is the charm that must be given to that person in order for that person to be okay".

0:10:57.460,0:11:00.740
You were practicing this for several years.

0:11:00.740,0:11:05.560
You were part and parcel of this - tell us, the people that would come to you with problems,

0:11:05.560,0:11:11.200
by the time you actually gave them a charm, what would end up happening to those people?

0:11:11.200,0:11:17.840
The charm would not work. People would follow me and tell me that they still had the same problem.

0:11:17.840,0:11:23.880
I would tell them, "Ok, come back. Let me take you to the stream, so that you can bathe".

0:11:23.880,0:11:31.400
I would consult my ancestors, "The person has phoned me again, the problem is still there.

0:11:31.400,0:11:36.100
The problem is not resolved. So what must I do now ?"

0:11:36.100,0:11:41.540
They would say, "Take the person to the water so that she can bathe with a chicken.

0:11:41.540,0:11:44.580
She must sacrifice a chicken and then things will be fine".

0:11:44.580,0:11:51.060
But the problem would still be there for that person. Eventually that person would not come back to me.

0:11:51.060,0:11:55.600
Okay, so the people that came to you with problems, after everything, collecting money,

0:11:55.600,0:12:00.840
consulting for them, the problem would still continue and even if not, would become worse.

0:12:00.840,0:12:05.180
Yes, the problem would still be there for those people who came to me.

0:12:05.180,0:12:10.620
You that was practicing as a sangoma, what was happening in your own life at this period?

0:12:10.620,0:12:18.700
In my own life I never had peace, my life was falling apart.

0:12:18.700,0:12:22.360
I myself needed help.

0:12:22.360,0:12:28.560
I would go to other traditional healers, to seek traditional doctors to help myself.

0:12:28.560,0:12:35.200
I was busy consulting people, but I myself needed help.

0:12:35.200,0:12:43.540
As you worked as a sangoma, what finally happened in the midst of this?

0:12:43.540,0:12:45.540
Okay.

0:12:45.540,0:12:52.120
I had a dream that they told me that I must go and do training inside the water.

0:12:52.120,0:12:55.540
I must go to the ocean. That's how they would lead me inside the water.

0:12:55.540,0:13:01.420
I must stay there for two years. Then I would come out as a powerful person.

0:13:01.420,0:13:08.660
I told myself, "No, I can't go there. What if I don't come back. I have kids to look after. I have family. I can't".

0:13:08.660,0:13:11.640
That's how I decided, "NO! This is not worth it".

0:13:11.640,0:13:20.580
I have struggled. I went from one witch doctor to another witch doctor to another - nothing!

0:13:20.580,0:13:26.760
Then all that slaughtering of goats, offering sacrifices every time, I had to beg and talk to a goat,

0:13:26.760,0:13:31.320
"Goat, please give me money. Goat, please help me. Goat, please I need this".

0:13:31.320,0:13:34.480
Every time, month to month, chicken, goat, chicken, goat...

0:13:34.480,0:13:37.980
I was tired of that life.

0:13:37.980,0:13:41.040
So, people of God, I hope we are listening to our sister's experience.

0:13:41.040,0:13:46.500
Especially for those who in the past have visited witch doctors, consulted sangomas.

0:13:46.500,0:13:52.220
This person speaking to us now has practical experience as someone that practiced in this,

0:13:52.220,0:13:55.660
and at the end of the day realized that everything came to nothing.

0:13:55.660,0:13:59.860
Now, sister you are mentioning some of the processes of initiation.

0:13:59.860,0:14:06.700
Could you just explain to us with the pictures here, what we are seeing here to verify what you're mentioning.

0:14:06.700,0:14:08.740
Okay. Here as you are looking.

0:14:08.740,0:14:14.380
This is where I drank the goat blood.

0:14:14.380,0:14:16.840
They poured the goat blood on me.

0:14:16.840,0:14:22.900
So, that you can accept your ancesters. That you are now officially a witch doctor.

0:14:22.900,0:14:29.780
Here, I went to the altar to beg the spirit of water, the mermaid.

0:14:29.780,0:14:36.100
Sometimes, these spirits come in different types - crocodile, mermaid or snake.

0:14:36.100,0:14:41.940
This is where I went to the water to beg the spirit to help me open my things in the ocean.

0:14:41.940,0:14:47.020
This is my shrine house where I practiced as a witch doctor.

0:14:47.020,0:14:55.940
This is me here when I did my sangoma dance, wearing this outfit and undergoing my training.

0:14:55.940,0:14:59.760
We also want to understand: When you were practicing as a sangoma,

0:14:59.760,0:15:05.540
were you also in a relationship with someone or did you get married at this period ?

0:15:05.540,0:15:17.600
Yes, I was married. The spirit made me choose between my marriage and them.

0:15:17.600,0:15:22.740
So. I had to leave the father of my kids because I was scared.

0:15:22.740,0:15:28.360
They said I will die and my family will be in trouble if I don't do this.

0:15:28.360,0:15:34.860
So you left your husband to worship these ancestors and to continue your practice as a sangoma?

0:15:34.860,0:15:37.000
Yes, I did.

0:15:37.000,0:15:39.980
Were you not permitted to have any relationship?

0:15:39.980,0:15:43.460
And what was happening to you in your dreams at this period concerning relationships ?

0:15:43.460,0:15:51.280
When you are a sangoma, especially when the spirit of a man enters you,

0:15:51.280,0:15:55.920
you won't have any feelings for men - only feelings for women.

0:15:55.920,0:16:01.020
I never told any of my friends that I was attracted to women.

0:16:01.020,0:16:06.900
I would watch women. I would be more attracted to women than men.

0:16:06.900,0:16:14.400
Because this spirit did not allow you to have a man in your life, that gave you affection to your fellow females.

0:16:14.400,0:16:19.000
Yes, even when I had a man in my life. I wouldn't have feelings for him.

0:16:19.000,0:16:21.920
I would never have feelings for that man.

0:16:21.920,0:16:26.240
You said it reached a point where you were told that you would have to go underwater

0:16:26.240,0:16:31.360
for two years to go through training, to increase your powers as a sangoma.

0:16:31.360,0:16:35.500
When you heard this, what step did you take after that ?

0:16:35.500,0:16:40.600
I told them, "No, I can't. I'd rather lose everything. I'd rather lose my life.

0:16:40.600,0:16:47.320
I can't do it. I'd rather take my life. I can't do it. I'll go to church. I can't do it.

0:16:47.320,0:16:54.060
I'm tired of you". I spent more than fifty thousand, hundred thousand,

0:16:54.060,0:17:01.560
going from one traditional healer to another. The problem would still be the same.

0:17:01.560,0:17:03.960
There was no solution for me.

0:17:03.960,0:17:08.380
So after you stopped doing the work of a sangoma, what began to happen to your life?

0:17:08.380,0:17:12.440
How did the spirits of sangoma now begin to destroy your life?

0:17:12.440,0:17:17.840
After that, I became a heavy smoker. I was a drunkard.

0:17:17.840,0:17:25.320
I'd drink from Monday morning until the next day. I'd drink at work, during working hours.

0:17:25.320,0:17:30.260
I'd sneak out from work to go drinking and smoking.

0:17:30.260,0:17:35.000
My life was going down the drain. There was no (hope).

0:17:35.000,0:17:39.300
I didn't have a life. So, I thought my life was over for me.

0:17:39.300,0:17:44.460
I'd take 12 or 6 a day - a whole box.

0:17:44.460,0:17:47.620
I would smoke - if I didn't smoke, I would shake.

0:17:47.620,0:17:53.100
I'd shake hard, "Let me go out to smoke!"

0:17:53.100,0:17:59.160
Even when I arrived here in Nigeria, people were looking at me at the airport,

0:17:59.160,0:18:01.700
"You are such a beautiful lady but you are smoking".

0:18:01.700,0:18:05.960
I was like, "They have to mind their own business. They don't know me.

0:18:05.960,0:18:08.520
I smoke. I'm a smoker".

0:18:08.520,0:18:11.600
Ok, so you were a chain smoker, a chronic smoker,

0:18:11.600,0:18:15.860
and you also took between 6 to 12 bottles of alcohol every day.

0:18:15.860,0:18:17.060
Yes

0:18:17.060,0:18:20.680
Ok, now. Today, we can see you here in The SCOAN.

0:18:20.680,0:18:26.520
Could you just tell us in the midst of this, how did you discover the ministry and what led you to be here today?

0:18:26.520,0:18:35.020
I went with my boyfriend to his friend's place. I was so drunk that night.

0:18:35.020,0:18:46.460
As we entered that friend's house, on top of the TV, I saw the New Morning Water.

0:18:46.460,0:18:51.780
So you saw a bottle of the Morning Water on top of the television of this friend.

0:18:51.780,0:18:52.760
Yes.

0:18:52.760,0:18:57.400
At this point, did you know anything about the Ministry of Tthe SCOAN,

0:18:57.400,0:18:59.620
Prophet T.B. Joshua or the Morning Water?

0:18:59.620,0:19:03.820
No, I didn't know anything about them.

0:19:03.820,0:19:09.940
When I saw the water, I took the bottle - this friend went to take a shower.

0:19:09.940,0:19:16.960
And then I asked myself, "What is this?" I looked at the bottle and kept on asking myself that question.

0:19:16.960,0:19:21.500
Then I sprayed myself and put that bottle back on top of the TV.

0:19:21.500,0:19:28.540
Then I kept quiet, I remained seated.

0:19:28.540,0:19:32.140
You said that at this period, you were completely drunk.

0:19:32.140,0:19:41.120
I was completely drunk that night when I saw the New Morning Water.

0:19:41.120,0:19:45.640
So, after spraying myself, my boyfriend came back and said,

0:19:45.640,0:19:50.140
"Refilwe, you must go home now. It's late". Then I went home.

0:19:50.140,0:19:57.580
When I got home and then woke up in the morning, I was like, "Huh? What's going on with my body?"

0:19:57.580,0:20:03.840
It was like I was dreaming, like something just went out of me. I was a new person.

0:20:03.840,0:20:10.260
I couldn't understand what was going on. I phoned my boyfriend, "Elvis, please I need that water.

0:20:10.260,0:20:14.020
I saw that water by your friend's place. Please, where can I get that water? Please!"

0:20:14.020,0:20:19.320
He said to me, "Refilwe, you can't get that water. You must go to Nigeria, SCOAN, Emmanuel".

0:20:19.320,0:20:23.140
I asked, "Who is Emmanuel? What is SCOAN? What is that?"

0:20:23.140,0:20:27.920
He said, "Please, when you have time, you must come and we'll talk. I'll explain everything to you".

0:20:27.920,0:20:32.100
So you knew immediately that it was that Morning Water you used

0:20:32.100,0:20:35.300
that caused the change in your body when you woke up the following day?

0:20:35.300,0:20:37.640
Yes, because the water delivered me.

0:20:37.640,0:20:46.200
God didn't judge me when I was drunk. That water delivered me when I was so drunk.

0:20:46.200,0:20:53.280
So it was the following morning when you woke up, that they introduced you to the MInistry.

0:20:53.280,0:20:57.700
You learned that you can only get this Morning Water here in Nigeria.

0:20:57.700,0:21:00.340
So, how did you manage to be here today?

0:21:00.340,0:21:09.640
Every day at work, I researched about the Church, passport and visa, and how to get it.

0:21:09.640,0:21:11.640
And then I finally made it here,

0:21:11.640,0:21:15.840
Okay. Before you made it, what was the last challenge you faced,

0:21:15.840,0:21:20.460
especially in your workplace before God enabled you to be here last week?

0:21:20.460,0:21:26.740
Okay, the first challenge - there were two roads.

0:21:26.740,0:21:30.580
Money or deliverance of my life.

0:21:30.580,0:21:34.120
I had to choose between those two roads. Then I prayed to God,

0:21:34.120,0:21:39.720
God, I've suffered for many years. This job, this money is nothing to me.

0:21:39.720,0:21:44.300
I'd rather quit this job and go for my healing and my deliverance.

0:21:44.300,0:21:50.060
I rather take Your road. Money will come after. At this stage, I don't care about money.

0:21:50.060,0:21:53.200
My deliverance is more important than money".

0:21:53.200,0:21:58.160
So, at your workplace, you were given an ultimatum that either you leave the job or you travel

0:21:58.160,0:22:01.160
because you wanted to travel without permission from your job.

0:22:01.160,0:22:03.800
So you had to take a critical decision at that moment.

0:22:03.800,0:22:08.000
Yes, it was a critical decision because I have bills to pay.

0:22:08.000,0:22:09.580
I'm a single parent.

0:22:09.580,0:22:13.100
I have kids. I have family (to take care of).

0:22:13.100,0:22:19.580
My rent is so expensive. I prayed, "God, You will see me through. I lack no faith.

0:22:19.580,0:22:26.700
I trust in You that You will come through for me. I'm quitting this job because I put my trust in You".

0:22:26.700,0:22:30.660
Amen, that's how you came straight to The SCOAN.

0:22:30.660,0:22:34.880
Now, tell us, sister - can you describe what happened to you last week,

0:22:34.880,0:22:37.980
as the evangelists were moving around ministering the New Morning Water.

0:22:37.980,0:22:39.820
What happened at that period?

0:22:39.820,0:22:49.520
When they were ministering the New Morning Water on me, I was feeling like my intestines were burning.

0:22:49.520,0:22:52.720
It was like I was burning inside.

0:22:52.720,0:22:57.600
I asked God, "What is going on? I'm burning!"

0:22:57.600,0:23:00.960
It was like something just went out of me.

0:23:00.960,0:23:03.300
Now I can see the light of God.

0:23:03.300,0:23:08.000
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ !

0:23:08.000,0:23:11.360
It's been one week after your wonderful deliverance.

0:23:11.360,0:23:16.300
Can you just testify to the changes you've seen in your life?

0:23:16.300,0:23:18.860
I thank God, I'm saved.

0:23:18.860,0:23:24.460
My life is more important than money. I thank God because He saved me.

0:23:24.460,0:23:27.980
I turned in my cigarette packets to one of the workers here,

0:23:27.980,0:23:37.660
That was on Monday after the touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:23:37.660,0:23:42.160
Okay, so you mean to say that these were the cigarettes you came with to Nigeria,

0:23:42.160,0:23:45.120
because as a chain smoker, you were smoking a packet every day.

0:23:45.120,0:23:45.840
Yes.

0:23:45.840,0:23:47.940
But after your deliverance, what happened?

0:23:47.940,0:23:52.540
After the deliverance on Monday, I handed them to one of the workers here.

0:23:52.540,0:23:56.600
So you mean, since last week till today, you have not touched...

0:23:56.600,0:24:02.600
No alcohol. No smoking. I'm clean.

0:24:02.600,0:24:04.980
And you no longer have that urge?

0:24:04.980,0:24:09.040
You said before, that your body would be shaking and desiring to smoke, to drink.

0:24:09.060,0:24:11.540
That urge is completely gone now?

0:24:11.540,0:24:15.880
Yes, I'd crave. I'd shake if I didn't smoke.

0:24:15.880,0:24:20.700
I used to shake when I didn't smoke and drink, but now I don't have that urge anymore.

0:24:20.700,0:24:24.920
My body is healed. I'm free, in the mighty name of Jesus!

0:24:24.920,0:24:28.880
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ !

0:24:28.880,0:24:31.960
So what are you going to do with these cigarettes now?

0:24:31.960,0:24:35.100
Throw them away!

0:24:35.100,0:24:38.420
It is history! It will never repeat itself!

0:24:38.420,0:24:43.120
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time !

0:24:43.120,0:24:47.840
Now, sister, we believe you're in a position to really advise our viewers all over the world.

0:24:47.840,0:24:53.440
A lot of people are still having the belief that perhaps if they visited a witch doctor or spiritualist,

0:24:53.440,0:24:56.300
they would be helped in one way or another.

0:24:56.300,0:25:02.200
But you're here giving your own life experience, testifying to the world that you were once a sangoma.

0:25:02.200,0:25:06.340
And every attempt you made to get help yourself failed during that period.

0:25:06.340,0:25:10.020
Even the people you thought you were helping actually were only being destroyed.

0:25:10.020,0:25:12.480
So what is your word of advice to our viewers?

0:25:12.480,0:25:15.620
Especially those who are still patronizing such places?

0:25:15.620,0:25:23.960
Ok, my word of advice is to the youth, because spirits are now tormenting the youth.

0:25:23.960,0:25:28.420
Especially in my country, and other countries as well. I say to them,

0:25:28.420,0:25:36.760
Please, there's no such thing as ancestors. It's only demons that are playing with your mind.

0:25:36.760,0:25:41.760
Go to the house of the Lord, to God. At the end, God will come through for you.

0:25:41.760,0:25:44.760
As God has come through for me, He will come through for you.

0:25:44.760,0:25:52.820
Leave these things, because the end is bad. The sangoma thing brings poverty, death in the family,

0:25:52.820,0:25:57.420
misery, and pain. Please! I advise especially the youth,

0:25:57.420,0:26:02.220
Don't be fooled by these traditional healers, witch doctors.

0:26:02.220,0:26:06.160
Stick to the Word of God because Jesus is alive !

0:26:06.160,0:26:13.660
Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:26:13.660,0:26:17.300
Testimony continues

0:26:17.300,0:26:21.660
My name is Refilwe. I'm 34 years old. I'm from South Africa.

0:26:21.660,0:26:27.620
The reason that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was suffering from the spirit of sangoma.

0:26:27.620,0:26:39.020
God finally came through for me. I managed to come to The SCOAN to get my deliverance and healing.

0:26:39.020,0:26:45.400
After all these years I had suffered from these spirits, I thank Lord Jesus because He came through for me.

0:26:45.400,0:26:50.740
Today I'm here, and I'm grateful to God, for what He has done for me.

0:26:50.740,0:26:58.380
After my deliverance, I can feel a lot of changes in my body.

0:26:58.380,0:27:05.500
As I have mentioned in my testimony , the worst of all was that I had to quit my job

0:27:05.500,0:27:10.120
because the deliverance in my life was more important than money.

0:27:10.120,0:27:18.820
God has already given me another position. I got another job, and I can't wait to go home,

0:27:18.820,0:27:22.040
to start a new life and start a new job.

0:27:22.040,0:27:26.940
You mean after you gave your testimony, you actually received employment in another position?

0:27:26.940,0:27:30.260
After you lost your job to come here, you now have another job ?

0:27:30.260,0:27:34.060
Yes, I now have another job. God has given me a better job.

0:27:34.060,0:27:37.680
It's with a company that I've been praying for all these months to work for.

0:27:37.680,0:27:40.980
So now I've gotten that opportunity from God.

0:27:40.980,0:27:44.780
I'm going to return to my country to start my new life, my new job.

0:27:44.780,0:27:47.660
In a couple of months, I'm going to open my new business.

0:27:47.660,0:27:49.820
Thank You, Jesus Christ !

0:27:49.820,0:27:57.240
And all of that - your past life, the spirit of smoking, drinking, everything is gone.

0:27:57.240,0:28:04.080
I don't have that craving anymore. Everything just disappeared. I'm a new person now.

0:28:04.080,0:28:06.980
I'm ready to kick in - in life.

0:28:06.980,0:28:09.040
Thank You, Jesus. We thank God for your life, sister.

0:28:09.040,0:28:12.800
And we're here today with a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners.

0:28:12.800,0:28:18.040
The man of God said he wants to really support you, as you are going back to start your new life now.

0:28:18.040,0:28:22.920
We know you really went through a test of faith before coming here to The SCOAN.

0:28:22.920,0:28:26.100
You persevered, you overcame and today your life is a living testimony

0:28:26.100,0:28:32.260
So Prophet T.B. Joshua said he wants to support you with this gift of 1,000 US dollars.

0:28:32.260,0:28:39.840
It is from Emmanuel TV partners and the prophet for you to really get going in your new life in Christ Jesus.

0:28:39.840,0:28:46.960
I am so happy. God has done it again. I thank you, Man of God, for the second gift.

0:28:46.960,0:28:55.160
The first gift was that you brought me inside the church, gave me free food and free accommodation.

0:28:55.160,0:28:58.900
I thank you for that. May the Lord bless you in the name of Jesus !

0:28:58.900,0:29:06.300
I thank you. And now this money! You saw that this lady (me) needed this money.

0:29:06.300,0:29:10.460
I thank you, Man of God. I thank you. May the Lord continue to bless you !

0:29:10.460,0:29:13.740
I thank you so much. I thank you.

0:29:13.740,0:29:15.960
Hallelujah. Thank You, Jesus Christ, once again.

0:29:15.960,0:29:19.560
We can see our sister overcome with joy at this wonderful blessing she's received.

0:29:19.560,0:29:23.400
This is 1,000 US dollars and the Word of God - The Mirror.

0:29:23.400,0:29:25.280
What can you say, sister?

0:29:25.280,0:29:30.420
I am so excited!

0:29:30.420,0:29:33.220
I didn't expect this !

0:29:33.220,0:29:39.180
I thank God. I thank You, Lord. I trusted in you.

0:29:39.180,0:29:41.660
That's why I had strong faith before I came here.

0:29:41.660,0:29:45.740
I said, "God, I know You'll never fail me. I know You'll never let me down".

0:29:45.740,0:29:52.400
I trusted in You from the minute I entered that plane. I thank You, Lord Jesus. Thank You so much !

0:29:52.400,0:29:55.500
Hallelujah ! Wow, indeed a million thanks are not enough.

0:29:55.500,0:29:59.340
Finally, sister, what is your word of advice to our viewers ?

0:29:59.340,0:30:03.020
My word of advice today is especially to the youngsters.

0:30:03.020,0:30:08.980
The witch doctor training things, the sangoma training things, they target mostly the youngsters.

0:30:08.980,0:30:15.460
There is no such thing as sangoma, ancestors - they are just demons.

0:30:15.460,0:30:18.260
They are just demons that will eat your money. They will finish your money.

0:30:18.260,0:30:22.120
Once they're done with you, they are through with you, then you'll become nothing.

0:30:22.120,0:30:26.780
I've learned that. I've been there. I have accepted Jesus now.

0:30:26.780,0:30:31.460
So, I want the youngsters to please follow the Word of God.

0:30:31.460,0:30:35.380
The Word of God takes you to the end.

0:30:35.380,0:30:39.860
The world of ancestors is just a meantime life.

0:30:39.860,0:30:45.360
Once they are through with you, you'll never be the same again. Thank You. Lord Jesus Christ !

0:30:45.360,0:30:49.860
We thank God for that word of advice. It is really born of life experience from our sister today.

0:30:49.860,0:30:54.500
She is victorious in Christ and her past is over and we give all the glory to God.

0:30:54.500,0:30:58.060
We believe she'll be coming back very soon with even more wonderful testimonies to share,

0:30:58.060,0:31:02.240
and we want to encourage you to continue to go forth, make the Word of God the standard for your life

0:31:02.240,0:31:05.120
and we believe the best is yet to come in Jesus' name !

0:31:05.120,0:31:08.640
Amen. I thank You, Lord Jesus !

0:31:08.640,0:31:12.580
Thank You for healing me. Thank You for everything You have done for me !
