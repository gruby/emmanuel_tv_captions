0:00:00.000,0:00:04.700
I was born and raised in Ohio.

0:00:04.700,0:00:08.440
When I was three years old, my father died in a semi accident.

0:00:08.440,0:00:13.700
He was hit by a semi truck coming home from work one night.

0:00:13.700,0:00:19.340
After that, there was a lot of hardship and a lot of struggle.

0:00:19.340,0:00:22.600
There were days we were not sure if we were going to eat or not.

0:00:22.600,0:00:29.160
In fourth grade, teachers told my mum that I was too hyper and I needed to be on medication.

0:00:29.160,0:00:31.500
I was then put on medication.

0:00:31.500,0:00:38.900
As the years went on, I was still depressed, even though I was on medication.

0:00:38.900,0:00:43.260
I started drinking and taking drugs.

0:00:43.260,0:00:49.340
And then, fast forward, after college - few months after I had graduated -

0:00:49.340,0:00:53.320
I tried to take my life by taking a bottle and a half of pills.

0:00:53.320,0:01:01.980
One night, I was just feeling so low, broken; my girlfriend at the time had just broken up with me.

0:01:01.980,0:01:07.580
I had just lost my job and was feeling so low.

0:01:07.580,0:01:11.860
I just felt like there was no reason for me to be alive.

0:01:11.860,0:01:21.020
So, I took a bottle and a half of pills and drank a bunch of alcohol.

0:01:21.020,0:01:23.820
Then, I drove to my friend's house.

0:01:23.820,0:01:26.320
I don't even remember driving there.

0:01:26.320,0:01:30.320
It was a miracle that I even made it to my friend's house.

0:01:30.320,0:01:35.320
In the middle of the night, I woke up and remembered that I had taken those pills.

0:01:35.320,0:01:39.880
I tried to stand up and go to the bathroom to throw up the pills

0:01:39.880,0:01:43.840
but my legs were numb from the effects of the medication.

0:01:43.840,0:01:48.440
I couldn't stand up, so I had to crawl to the bathroom.

0:01:48.440,0:01:52.280
When I got to the bathroom, I tried to throw up the pills.

0:01:52.280,0:02:05.440
That is the last thing I remember because I blacked out and went into a seizure.

0:02:05.440,0:02:07.700
The next thing I know is that I woke up in an emergency room.

0:02:07.700,0:02:11.180
I literally thought it was a dream.

0:02:11.180,0:02:18.160
After I got out of the hospital, I was still drinking and feeling depressed.

0:02:18.160,0:02:24.120
Then, I met an evangelist from The SCOAN.

0:02:24.120,0:02:30.980
She gave me a bottle of the New Morning Water by Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:30.980,0:02:36.220
When I got home, I began to minister it to myself,

0:02:36.220,0:02:44.280
began to apply it to myself everyday, believing God for healing and deliverance.

0:02:44.280,0:02:45.760
And I got that healing.

0:02:45.760,0:02:49.740
A couple of months later, I was able to throw out all the pills.

0:02:49.740,0:02:53.120
It's been almost six years now that I have taken medication.

0:02:53.120,0:02:54.740
Now, I feel free and good.

0:02:54.740,0:02:57.980
I used to be depressed and suicidal.

0:02:57.980,0:03:05.760
Now, I work full time for the Emmanuel TV USA team and we work with all kinds of kids

0:03:05.760,0:03:09.940
that grew up in hardship just like I did.

0:03:09.940,0:03:16.780
We feed the homeless, help the elderly, and do all kinds of great things.

0:03:16.780,0:03:23.220
I am just so thankful and grateful that God used Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:03:23.220,0:03:27.460
to bring the New Morning Water into my life and heal and deliver me.

0:03:27.460,0:03:32.020
If God can do it for me, He can do it for you.

0:03:32.020,0:03:34.400
This INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY Will Touch Your Heart!!!
