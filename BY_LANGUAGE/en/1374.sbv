Emmanuel TV Choir Christmas Carols
From The Manger Square In Bethlehem

0:00:07.320,0:00:23.460
I believe
Help my unbelief

0:00:23.460,0:01:22.220
Lord I believe
Help me overcome my unbelief

0:01:22.220,0:01:28.760
Believing is the only condition
For answered prayer

0:01:28.760,0:01:36.560
With my mouth I confess
And with my heart I believe

0:01:36.560,0:01:44.840
I believe God's Word
Is true for my life

0:01:44.840,0:02:05.060
Lord I believe
Help me overcome my unbelief

0:02:05.060,0:02:12.620
Don't let the devil
Get you out of faith

0:02:12.620,0:02:20.400
If you believe and do not doubt
Your faith takes over

0:02:20.400,0:02:28.200
Believing in Christ
That is my connection

0:02:28.200,0:02:34.500
I don't say amen
Because everyone says amen

0:02:34.500,0:02:42.860
But I say amen
Because I believe

0:02:42.860,0:03:35.460
Lord I believe
Help me overcome my unbelief

0:03:35.460,0:03:48.560
Believe is the only condition

0:03:48.560,0:03:52.120
Help my unbelief

0:03:52.120,0:04:04.100
Believe is the only condition

0:04:04.100,0:04:07.480
Help my unbelief

0:04:07.480,0:04:19.460
Believe is the only condition

0:04:19.460,0:04:34.400
Help my unbelief
