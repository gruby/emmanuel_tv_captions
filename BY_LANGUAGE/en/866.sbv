0:00:00.020,0:00:02.140
Come on, brother.

0:00:02.140,0:00:06.680
You have a problem with your wife.

0:00:06.680,0:00:09.540
Come out!

0:00:09.540,0:00:13.800
Your wife wants to leave you.

My name is Augustine Igbinovia.

0:00:22.180,0:00:26.800
I'm from Edo State, Nigeria, but I reside in South Africa.

0:00:26.800,0:00:32.420
Last week Sunday. I was inside this church, sitting by this side

0:00:32.420,0:00:37.740
when the man of God called me out and prophesied that I have a problem in my marriage.

0:00:37.740,0:00:41.580
I confirm that prophecy to be a hundred percent true.

0:00:41.580,0:00:53.380
I have a problem in my marriage as a result of unfaithfulness due to the spirit of lust.

0:00:53.380,0:00:59.080
I have been unfaithful to my wife.

0:00:59.080,0:01:04.880
I indulged myself in communicating on social media via my phone.

0:01:04.880,0:01:07.920
At the beginning, I didn't go outside.

0:01:07.920,0:01:12.140
My wife was suspecting me because I was always on my phone.

0:01:12.140,0:01:16.820
As the result of the spirit of lust, I developed the spirit of anger.

0:01:16.820,0:01:20.980
Any time my wife accused me of doing something that I was not supposed to do in the marriage,

0:01:20.980,0:01:30.000
I ended up being angry. And most of the times I'd beat her up and she'd call the cops on me.

0:01:30.000,0:01:35.860
The spirit of lust entered me after I got married.

0:01:35.860,0:01:42.700
The spirit of lust entered me through communicating on social media.

0:01:42.700,0:01:52.500
My wife was unhappy. The spirit of lust caused me to beat my wife on two occations.

0:01:52.500,0:02:01.320
On the third time, she called the police, and I was given a protection order for me not to come close to her.

0:02:01.320,0:02:06.580
We have been separated for eight months now.

0:02:06.580,0:02:09.480
This is the letter of the protection order,

0:02:09.480,0:02:16.300
and this is my divorce summon, issued to me by my wife's lawyer.

0:02:16.300,0:02:17.200
Okay.

0:02:17.200,0:02:25.540
After the problems in my marriage, my wife told me to go to The SCOAN.

0:02:25.540,0:02:33.280
Until I got my deliverance, or until the man of God invited her, the marriage would be over.

0:02:33.280,0:02:43.900
Man of God, most of the time, I reacted towards my wife with anger which was due to my past relationship.

0:02:43.900,0:02:48.340
I had a 10-year relationship prior to this marriage - with a lady I was supposed to get married to.

0:02:48.340,0:02:52.020
Despite everything I did for her...

0:02:52.020,0:02:55.720
Your wife has how many children for you?

0:02:55.720,0:02:58.420
One, sir. One daughter, sir.

0:02:58.420,0:03:01.620
I think they are here now. Let her come out.

0:03:01.620,0:03:06.480
The more he talks, the more he provokes the Spirit of God.

0:03:06.480,0:03:09.000
It's better we do not hear from you.

0:03:25.080,0:03:33.320
After the deliverance here on Sunday and listening to what he was saying,

0:03:33.320,0:03:39.720
I realised that there was a need for me to give a call to our sister.

0:03:39.720,0:03:43.480
I had to call her. I was the one who spoke with you.

0:03:43.480,0:03:47.200
Thank you for honouring this call.

0:03:47.200,0:03:48.700
Thank you, Sir.

She knows what it means to marry and what marriage means.

0:03:59.920,0:04:03.960
She is a godly person.

0:04:03.960,0:04:10.660
No matter what happened, we need to know God's opinion. That is why she is here.

0:04:10.660,0:04:18.900
Not that there's a special thing in you. You just have that zeal for God.

0:04:18.900,0:04:22.440
Marriage is not a hobby.

0:04:22.440,0:04:26.240
This is a relationship.

0:04:26.240,0:04:30.260
We need to meet the father of relationship - God -

0:04:30.260,0:04:34.980
for whatever happened in a relationship. That is why she is here.

0:04:34.980,0:04:41.320
My sister, this is a marriage from God.

0:04:41.320,0:04:49.900
I want to assure you. After the meeting here, I will sit with you people.

0:04:49.900,0:04:56.860
He will write a note. He will sign.

0:04:56.860,0:05:09.620
He is a bad bad boy. That's all. I will not say more than that. He is a bad boy.

0:05:09.620,0:05:14.380
God says, Give him another try. Simple.

0:05:14.380,0:05:18.360
He's a bad boy, but that boy has been delivered.

0:05:18.360,0:05:23.320
He can still go back to being bad because you have your life.

0:05:23.320,0:05:25.200
There is nothing we can do.

0:05:25.200,0:05:29.400
God has delivered you. You can still choose to go back to that bad life.

0:05:29.400,0:05:32.320
But he is a bad boy. I will not say more than that.

0:05:32.320,0:05:34.560
So, thank you very much, my daughter.

0:05:34.560,0:05:36.960
After the meeting, I'm going to meet you.

0:05:36.960,0:05:43.140
Don't bother to say anything. Anything you say will scatter our reconciliation.

0:05:43.140,0:05:45.720
We don't want to hear anything.

0:05:45.720,0:05:50.420
Please give thanks to God. God says you should give him another chance.

0:05:50.420,0:05:52.900
So give him another chance.

0:05:52.900,0:05:55.240
I will not say...

0:05:55.240,0:05:57.560
This is the presence of God.

0:05:57.560,0:06:03.420
I will not stand here and because I'm a Nigerian and you are a Nigerian, I will begin to say...

0:06:03.420,0:06:05.880
We are saying the mind of God.

0:06:05.880,0:06:09.020
Give thanks to God: "God, we thank You for giving me another chance".

0:06:09.020,0:06:10.780
Give this man another chance.

0:06:10.780,0:06:14.660
Thank Him because of your wonderful child.

0:06:14.660,0:06:16.000
Thank you.

I would like to thank the man of God for his words.

0:06:28.680,0:06:32.460
I'd also like to thank him for inviting me here.

0:06:32.460,0:06:38.380
He provided everything - from the ticket to fly here, the accommodation, and the food.

0:06:38.380,0:06:49.140
Thank you very much, Man of God. I will honour your words as I have always done. Thank you, Sir.

0:06:49.140,0:06:58.260
You can give thanks to God for giving you another chance.

0:06:58.260,0:07:05.000
Man of God, I want to say thank you for reconciling my marriage

0:07:05.000,0:07:09.180
and for letting God use you to give me another chance in my marriage.

0:07:09.180,0:07:11.200
I promise never to go back to my old ways.

Standard for Life

0:07:42.820,0:07:46.340
My name is Augustine Igbinovia.

0:07:46.340,0:07:50.800
I'm a Nigerian from Edo State, residing in South Africa.

0:07:50.800,0:07:56.260
The lady beside me is my lovely wife, Mrs Mpho Igbinovia from South Africa.

0:07:56.260,0:08:01.100
You're welcome, Sir. Can you just tell us - since you're coming to The SCOAN,

0:08:01.100,0:08:04.840
what God Almighty has done for you, especially in the area of your marriage.

0:08:04.840,0:08:11.260
I want to first thank God and thank Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:08:11.260,0:08:16.020
for reconciling my marriage and bringing back peace to my home.

0:08:16.020,0:08:24.360
I'm the one the man of God prophesied about who had a problem in his marriage due to the spirit of lust.

0:08:24.360,0:08:30.400
I want to say, Thank You, God and thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:08:30.400,0:08:34.360
for bringing back peace to my home and restoring my marriage.

0:08:34.360,0:08:39.840
The man of God said that I have a lovely wife.

0:08:39.840,0:08:45.920
He also said that I should make sure not to go back to my old ways.

0:08:45.920,0:08:54.440
He asked me to write an undertaking that I have written to the man of God, stating my promise to him.

0:08:54.440,0:09:01.280
This is my promise, undertaking letter to God and to the man of God as well

0:09:01.280,0:09:03.980
that I'll never go back to my old ways.

0:09:03.980,0:09:11.640
I read: I, Augustine Igbinovia, 32 years of age, from Edo State, Nigeria,

0:09:11.640,0:09:16.840
would like to thank the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua for reconciling my marriage.

0:09:16.840,0:09:23.880
And I promise God and him that I will never go back to all the bad and negative ways I have been living my life.

0:09:23.880,0:09:28.880
And I want God to give me the grace and strength to keep my promise in Jesus' name.

0:09:28.880,0:09:37.420
This letter was signed by me on the 14th of March 2017 at 12:24 am.

0:09:37.420,0:09:43.000
This is an undertaking that the man of God has asked me to write,

0:09:43.000,0:09:47.480
stating that I promise never to go back to my old ways.

0:09:47.480,0:09:55.100
And if I go against what I've written here, whatever happens is left for me to answer.

0:09:55.100,0:09:58.580
We give glory to God that you are here today with your wife at The SCOAN.

0:09:58.580,0:10:02.280
So since the word of prophecy you received last week during the prayer,

0:10:02.280,0:10:05.520
can you just tell us the changes you've witnessed in your life?

0:10:05.520,0:10:08.600
I can say that I have found total peace.

0:10:08.600,0:10:15.480
Since Sunday, I've found peace with myself.

0:10:15.480,0:10:18.440
The spirit of lust totally left me.

0:10:18.440,0:10:22.980
How do you know that the spirit of lust has left you?

0:10:22.980,0:10:32.980
I know because before, whenever I saw a lady, I'd lust after her.

0:10:32.980,0:10:35.980
But since my deliverance and the prophecy from the man of God,

0:10:35.980,0:10:41.100
I no longer feel that way anymore, and the spirit of lust has left me.

0:10:41.100,0:10:45.260
You're standing next to your wife now. What do you want to say to her?

0:10:45.260,0:10:51.020
I want to apologise to my wife for the wrong things I have done in the past.

0:10:51.020,0:10:53.860
I promise to stay faithful to her in this marriage

0:10:53.860,0:10:56.440
And I promise to love her like never before.

0:10:56.440,0:11:00.200
My name is Mpho Igbinovia from South Africa.

0:11:00.200,0:11:03.860
The man standing next to me is my wonderful husband.

0:11:03.860,0:11:09.220
The man of God told me that I and my husband need to stay steadfast in prayer.

0:11:09.220,0:11:16.800
He told me that I need to monitor him as a wife, to make sure that he doesn't go back to his old ways.

0:11:16.800,0:11:19.360
We saw your husband reading an undertaking,

0:11:19.360,0:11:24.360
confirming that he has promised God not to return to his past. What can you say?

0:11:24.360,0:11:32.440
I accept the undertaking and I thank the man of God for making him understand

0:11:32.440,0:11:38.780
the importance of him following what he should or shouldn't do.

0:11:38.780,0:11:42.320
I'm very happy and pleased

0:11:42.320,0:11:46.960
and I pray that God strengthens him so that he will not go back to his old ways.

0:11:46.960,0:11:49.560
Amen. We thank Jesus Christ.

0:11:49.560,0:11:52.840
Just in the little time you've been in here in The SCOAN,

0:11:52.840,0:11:56.540
what are the the changes that you've witnessed just in this short time?

0:11:56.540,0:12:01.120
My husband is more laughing now. Just like it was in the beginning.

0:12:01.120,0:12:06.700
He is showing love to both me and his family as well.

0:12:06.700,0:12:14.180
So, I can surely say that slowly but surely he is showing the signs that he has changed.

0:12:14.180,0:12:17.360
We thank Jesus Christ.

0:12:17.360,0:12:20.480
You mentioned that you've actuallly filed for divorced.

0:12:20.480,0:12:23.680
We saw the divorce letter that was being held up on Sunday.

0:12:23.680,0:12:27.960
In the light of what God has done for you here, what is your decision concerning this?

0:12:27.960,0:12:33.800
My decision is that I am definitely going to honour the words of the man of God

0:12:33.800,0:12:36.780
because I believe that through him, God speaks.

0:12:36.780,0:12:44.180
I will definitely call off the divorce as I also want to work things out with my husband.

0:12:44.180,0:12:49.840
Thank God, Madam. We'd like to ask you in the light of what you have received here in The SCOAN,

0:12:49.840,0:12:52.580
and the counsel of Prophet T.B. Joshua that he has given to you,

0:12:52.580,0:12:57.700
what is your word of advice to viewers around the world, especially to married couples?

0:12:57.700,0:13:01.200
I would like to tell them that as Prophet T.B. Joshua always says,

0:13:01.200,0:13:05.320
it's always good to run to God and not to anybody else.

0:13:05.320,0:13:09.760
We all know that the devil does not like places where love exists

0:13:09.760,0:13:13.680
so we need to shame the devil and make sure that whatever situation,

0:13:13.680,0:13:16.180
whatever troubles that you might be going through,

0:13:16.180,0:13:19.520
you need to make sure that you run to God and not to anybody else.

0:13:19.520,0:13:23.560
In life, there are many voices that one can hear.

0:13:23.560,0:13:26.860
T.B. Joshua always says that we must listen to the voice of God,

0:13:26.860,0:13:30.620
not to the voice of your friends or family or the voice of the devil.

0:13:30.620,0:13:31.820
Listen to the voice of God.

0:13:31.820,0:13:40.020
My advice to viewers all around the world, both married and unmarried:

0:13:40.020,0:13:48.800
If you find yourself moving from a hurtful relationship to the next relationship.

0:13:48.800,0:13:53.380
I want you to allow God to release you first before you move into the next relationship

0:13:53.380,0:13:57.480
because if you carry the pain from the past relationship into your new relationship, like I did,

0:13:57.480,0:14:01.120
you will likely end up experiencing the same thing as I have experienced in my marriage.

0:14:01.120,0:14:04.540
You mean to say in your own case, you carried pain of a past relationship

0:14:04.540,0:14:07.820
into this marriage and that really affected the marriage.

0:14:07.820,0:14:13.740
Yes, in my own case, I carried the pain of my past relationship into my marriage

0:14:13.740,0:14:16.180
and it truly affected me.

0:14:16.180,0:14:22.800
I want to apologise to my wife who has been suffering from my pain of the past.

0:14:22.800,0:14:31.240
I want to advise every viewer to make God's Word the standard of their life and their marriage.

0:14:31.240,0:14:35.960
Amen. Thank You, Jesus. We want to encourage this couple to continue to stay close to Jesus Christ

0:14:35.960,0:14:39.060
and we believe the two of you will come back here with more wonderful testimonies,

0:14:39.060,0:14:43.820
now that God Almighty has come into this matter, and we know the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:14:43.820,0:14:45.180
Amen.

0:14:45.180,0:14:47.300
Thank You, Jesus.
