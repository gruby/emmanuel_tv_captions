PROPHETIC MESSAGE FOR 2017 | Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:02.980,0:00:05.140
Good morning! 
(Good morning.)

0:00:05.140,0:00:10.940
You may be seated - thank you.

0:00:10.940,0:00:15.120
The message is 'Your Faith Will Not Fail'.

0:00:15.120,0:00:23.220
Let me take you to the book of Luke 22 from verse 1 to the end but we will go straight to the proof text.

0:00:23.220,0:00:27.100
Luke 22:32. Are you there?

0:00:27.100,0:00:36.140
"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail."

0:00:36.140,0:00:44.020
And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."

0:00:44.020,0:00:45.700
Look at the word 'turn back'.

0:00:45.700,0:00:47.720
This is the way you are going.

0:00:47.720,0:00:53.540
I am going this way and you are saying, "T.B. Joshua, when you have turned back,

0:00:53.540,0:00:57.280
remember your brother..."

0:00:57.280,0:01:04.520
'When you have turned back, remember your brother and also, help them to turn back.'

0:01:04.520,0:01:07.220
Let's read verse 33:

0:01:07.220,0:01:13.900
"But he replied, 'Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death'.”

0:01:13.900,0:01:17.700
Aah, that is too confident.

0:01:17.700,0:01:21.000
The Lord is telling him that, "I'm afraid of you."

0:01:21.000,0:01:26.920
"No, don't be afraid of me. I am for You."- "I doubt you will be able to stand for Me."

0:01:26.920,0:01:30.120
No, don't doubt I can die for you.

0:01:30.120,0:01:38.740
"Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today,

0:01:38.740,0:01:43.820
you will deny three times that you know me."

0:01:43.820,0:01:49.120
Jesus knew that he was going to betray Him.

0:01:49.120,0:01:57.240
Jesus said to him again, 'After you have repented, you are to strenghten your brothers'.

0:01:57.240,0:02:06.640
It means, Jesus knew that Peter would betray Him and also knew that he would repent.

0:02:06.640,0:02:11.080
You are here today - Jesus knows you will repent.

0:02:11.080,0:02:14.400
Tell your neighbour.

0:02:14.400,0:02:15.800
Because He knows you.

0:02:15.800,0:02:21.920
Whatever happens, you are a stakeholder of the Kingdom of God.

0:02:21.920,0:02:24.220
You have a seat.

0:02:24.220,0:02:29.660
If your seat is empty, He knows that nobody can take over that seat; you will still come back.

0:02:29.660,0:02:32.760
Tell your neighbour: "Jesus knows I will repent".

0:02:32.760,0:02:34.700
(Jesus knows I will repent.)

0:02:34.700,0:02:47.820
If that is the case, as a born-again, your faith may fail but not utterly, not fall off.

0:02:47.820,0:02:55.060
Tell your neighbour: "My faith may fail, not utterly." I mean, not fall off.

0:02:55.060,0:02:56.180
Again.

0:02:56.180,0:03:00.360
(My faith may fail, not utterly.)

0:03:00.360,0:03:10.360
Yes. Your faith may fail as a born-again but not utterly - that is, not fall off.

0:03:10.360,0:03:17.620
Because that faith is your root, your seed.

0:03:17.620,0:03:22.780
It remains in you - that is, you will still come back.

0:03:22.780,0:03:33.180
If you are a true born-again, your faith may fail but not utterly.

0:03:33.180,0:03:35.600
That means, you will still come back.

0:03:35.600,0:03:42.460
If you have wronged now, if you have missed the mark, you will still come back.

0:03:42.460,0:03:43.880
(Amen.)

0:03:43.880,0:03:47.280
That is the meaning of "born-again".

0:03:47.280,0:03:52.440
Once you are born-again, no one and nothing can separate you from God.

0:03:52.440,0:03:56.260
It is just to be born-again, genuinely.

0:03:56.260,0:04:00.440
But if you are not genuinely born-again - forget.

0:04:00.440,0:04:07.040
But, if you are genuinely born-again, nothing and nothing can separate you.

0:04:07.040,0:04:11.660
Your faith may fail, not utterly, not fall off.

0:04:11.660,0:04:16.220
"Once you are born-again you can not make a mistake" - that is the teaching.

0:04:16.220,0:04:22.460
And when you make mistake, aah, you do not want people to know.

0:04:22.460,0:04:26.500
Do you know what mistake can lead to?

0:04:26.500,0:04:33.220
Mistake cause serious, difficult circumstances.

0:04:33.220,0:04:38.880
Mistake cause difficult what?

0:04:38.880,0:04:47.360
And through difficult circumstances, you will be offended.

0:04:47.360,0:04:50.540
Through situations, you will be offended.

0:04:50.540,0:04:55.360
If you have pain now, or a headache, fever or cancer

0:04:55.360,0:05:01.060
and that pain is all over you, little things can offend you, overwhelm you.

0:05:01.060,0:05:04.560
Even when people greet you - do not greet me!

0:05:04.560,0:05:07.540
As if they the ones that had put a cancer in your body.

0:05:07.540,0:05:14.480
Through pain, through difficult circumstances, it may be disappointment...

0:05:14.480,0:05:18.860
You went to the company, and you expect to receive some goods.

0:05:18.860,0:05:21.380
Getting there, they say there is nothing like that.

0:05:21.380,0:05:25.500
Or getting to your company, they give you a sack letter.

0:05:25.500,0:05:32.060
You realize that in your company the young one has been promoted to supervise you.

0:05:32.060,0:05:35.660
As a human being, how would you feel?

0:05:35.660,0:05:39.720
Offence.

0:05:39.720,0:05:44.100
Whatever you begin to do at that moment will not come from your heart.

0:05:44.100,0:05:48.680
Everything around you will irritate and overwhelm you.

0:05:48.680,0:05:51.760
You will not want to give your best.

0:05:51.760,0:06:01.120
Even if you see money, you want to dupe, embezzle, to change the figures.

0:06:01.120,0:06:09.320
Through difficult circumstances, you will be offended.

0:06:09.320,0:06:12.880
You wake up in the morning and you find that you have had a nightmare.

0:06:12.880,0:06:18.880
Suddenly you look at your bed, you see that you wet the bed, a lot of things happened to you in the dream.

0:06:18.880,0:06:22.660
By the time you wake up you feel irritated.

0:06:22.660,0:06:39.800
If our faith is being kept up in an hour of temptation, though we may fall -

0:06:39.800,0:06:46.760
that is, our faith may fall – yet we shall not be utterly cast down.

0:06:46.760,0:06:56.920
In the case of His disciples, Jesus said, 'I pray your faith will not fail'.

0:06:56.920,0:06:59.500
Are you with me?

0:06:59.500,0:07:08.300
Your faith may fail but not totally, not finally.

0:07:08.300,0:07:20.580
As it was with Job, with God's permission, you can be tempted.

0:07:20.580,0:07:26.700
You know: satan went to God to beg, "Allow me to do this to this man."

0:07:26.700,0:07:33.160
Satan's desire for you, as a Christian, is to have you, to attack you.

0:07:33.160,0:07:44.480
Don't forget he begged for permission from God to attack Job.

0:07:44.480,0:07:51.320
With God's permission, you can be attacked.

0:07:51.320,0:07:54.060
With God's permission, you can be tempted.

0:07:54.060,0:08:00.760
So, you Christian, if you now say; "why all this happening to me, why this, why this attack? I am a Christian."

0:08:00.760,0:08:04.820
No - with God's permission, you can be tempted.

0:08:04.820,0:08:17.120
If God allows it, if God has knowledge of it, if God is aware,

0:08:17.120,0:08:22.140
as was the case of Job, don't doubt your God.

0:08:22.140,0:08:26.920
Do not begin to doubt; "Why me? Am I not serving the living God? Why God should allow this to happen ?" …

0:08:26.920,0:08:29.820
Don’t doubt your God.

0:08:29.820,0:08:32.520
Don't let it affect your faith.

0:08:32.520,0:08:38.700
You can be attacked but you cannot be destroyed if God allows it.

0:08:38.700,0:08:41.720
What is happening to you as a born-again?

0:08:41.720,0:08:45.140
You born-again, what is happening to you?

0:08:45.140,0:08:57.120
As it was with Job, with God's permission, satan can tempt you.

0:08:57.120,0:09:08.340
As it was with Job, with God's permission, satan can attack you but cannot destroy you.

0:09:08.340,0:09:10.120
(Amen.)

0:09:10.120,0:09:20.120
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:09:20.120,0:09:28.340
Tell your neighbour, "If you are a true born-again, a true follower of Christ,

0:09:28.340,0:09:39.760
satan can only attack you if God permits it."

0:09:39.760,0:09:49.680
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:09:49.680,0:09:58.220
That means he can only attack you if God permits it.

0:09:58.220,0:10:09.900
Such attack will result in your desire for God – will strengthen your desire for God.

0:10:09.900,0:10:17.160
It will strengthen your determination for God – will improve your relationship.

0:10:17.160,0:10:24.440
Such an attack will make you strong.

0:10:24.440,0:10:35.060
Such attack will not impair you but improve you, if God permits it.

0:10:35.060,0:10:40.880
It is when you know this, you become a beneficiary.

0:10:40.880,0:10:44.060
You see that is it an attack.

0:10:44.060,0:10:45.680
Who are you?

0:10:45.680,0:10:47.260
I am a child of God.

0:10:47.260,0:10:50.540
Yes - God is aware.

0:10:50.540,0:10:58.420
God permitted it and He is going to improve me, strengthen my desire, my determination.

0:10:58.420,0:11:07.180
I am not here today, to tell you about Moses or Jeremiah but I am telling you about what is happening to you.

0:11:07.180,0:11:08.840
(Amen.)

0:11:08.840,0:11:12.900
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:11:12.900,0:11:15.740
This is exactly what happens to you.

0:11:15.740,0:11:20.560
You would have been growing in your Christian life better than this

0:11:20.560,0:11:28.760
but each time this attack came, you forgot you were a Christian.

0:11:28.760,0:11:35.600
And if you know you are a Christian, a follower of God, you should know that God has knowledge of it.

0:11:35.600,0:11:44.120
And if God has knowledge of it, it means this attack will not impair you but improve you.

0:11:44.120,0:11:53.060
If God is aware, this means this temptation will make you stronger.

0:11:53.060,0:12:04.440
If God allows it, this means your desire and determination for God will increase.

0:12:04.440,0:12:06.440
This is just it.

0:12:06.440,0:12:11.000
It's only we cannot continue to pray for an attack or temptation.

0:12:11.000,0:12:14.360
It comes naturally, if God allows it.

0:12:14.360,0:12:18.460
It's a blessing.

0:12:18.460,0:12:24.060
If you are not a Christian, opposite is the case.

0:12:24.060,0:12:28.880
We know if you are not a Christian, satan cannot attack his children.

0:12:28.880,0:12:32.660
Can satan attack his children?

0:12:32.660,0:12:35.820
If satan cannot attack his children…

0:12:35.820,0:12:40.000
You are not his children, that is why you are attacked.

0:12:40.000,0:12:43.760
Tell your neighbour: "Your faith will  not fail".

0:12:43.760,0:12:47.120
I cannot hear you.

0:12:47.120,0:12:49.940
This coming year, your faith will not fail.

0:12:49.940,0:12:52.400
(Amen.)

0:12:52.400,0:13:00.420
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:13:00.420,0:13:13.920
Our situation, I mean our difficult circumstances – satan uses them to draw us into sin.

0:13:13.920,0:13:22.100
Satan uses our situation, our difficult circumstances, to draw us into what? Into sin.

0:13:22.100,0:13:33.400
The moment this attack comes, your thoughts change, you begin to see God in a bad light.

0:13:33.400,0:13:36.300
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:13:36.300,0:13:42.940
Oh my God, you begin to see God in a bad light.

0:13:42.940,0:13:48.720
Your Saviour will now turn into …

0:13:48.720,0:13:54.320
To pray is difficult because your heart is not in its best state.

0:13:54.320,0:13:58.960
It is when your heart or your spirit is in its best state that you can pray.

0:13:58.960,0:14:01.640
But you are worried.

0:14:01.640,0:14:06.460
No one can pray to God while worried.

0:14:06.460,0:14:12.340
Tell your neighbour: "No one can pray to God while worried"

0:14:12.340,0:14:16.960
You will make an attempt but you are not praying to God, you are praying to yourself.

0:14:16.960,0:14:20.440
You are worried.

0:14:20.440,0:14:25.440
You now say: Jesus, give me a biscuit...No no no no

0:14:25.440,0:14:33.860
Your heart must be at its best because our heart is the prayer room.

0:14:33.860,0:14:36.040
Can you see why you keep deceiving yourself?

0:14:36.040,0:14:40.480
"Our heart is the prayer room" - tell your neighbour.

0:14:40.480,0:14:44.480
Say, "My heart is the prayer room".

0:14:44.480,0:14:49.860
So, if your heart is the prayer room, your heart must be at its best.

0:14:49.860,0:14:55.420
If your heart is the prayer room, where you keep as the prayer room is an altar…

0:14:55.420,0:14:57.460
Look at the altar.

0:14:57.460,0:15:09.220
If you came this morning and you saw shit, urine, flies everywhere, dust bins,

0:15:09.220,0:15:12.500
would you be able to sit down?

0:15:12.500,0:15:13.900
… so, in the same way…

0:15:13.900,0:15:19.540
If your heart is not at its best, whom are you praying to?

0:15:19.540,0:15:28.880
If you are troubled, you cannot pray and if you pray, you are praying of yourself.

0:15:28.880,0:15:40.840
That is why the enemy will often use this as a bait to get you – your situation.

0:15:40.840,0:15:46.340
Satan uses our situation, our difficult circumstances -

0:15:46.340,0:15:51.320
disappointment, failure, nightmares and everything around you not going well -

0:15:51.320,0:15:57.460
satan uses all these to draw us into sin.

0:15:57.460,0:16:00.480
He knows it is the only thing that can change your heart.

0:16:00.480,0:16:04.600
Your heart when it is at its best – you think about Christ, you meditate, you sing;

0:16:04.600,0:16:07.540
but when the trouble comes you change your confession.

0:16:07.540,0:16:16.300
You begin to see Jesus in a bad light.

0:16:16.300,0:16:21.300
That is why satan was waiting for a time like that to attack Jesus.

0:16:21.300,0:16:26.780
After realising Jesus had fasted for forty days and forty nights, satan realized that that man needs food.

0:16:26.780,0:16:32.040
And you know that when you fasted for forty days and forty nights then you need food badly.

0:16:32.040,0:16:35.840
Oh yes, this is the time to attack this man, situation

0:16:35.840,0:16:40.740
This is the time to attack this man, difficult circumstances – oh yes, He has difficulties now.

0:16:40.740,0:16:45.720
He needs food. 
He now took Him.

0:16:45.720,0:16:51.800
He began to seduce Him with food and every beautiful thing in the world.

0:16:51.800,0:16:55.180
But thank God – He was not desperate.

0:16:55.180,0:16:57.860
But today you are desperate.

0:16:57.860,0:17:01.400
Your desperation leads you to take anything.

0:17:01.400,0:17:09.080
No matter from where it comes, as long as you have a relief.

0:17:09.080,0:17:10.740
Jesus was not desperate.

0:17:10.740,0:17:16.740
He said, 'Although I am hungry, but I am not desperate'.

0:17:16.740,0:17:21.540
Although I am hungry, I've been fasting for forty days and forty nights, I am looking for something to eat

0:17:21.540,0:17:26.700
but I am not desperate.

0:17:26.700,0:17:31.360
To be desperate is to be so anxious…

0:17:31.360,0:17:36.380
You do not mind from where the food comes from, you just want to eat.

0:17:36.380,0:17:39.540
It was a food, and you tested, and it was good.

0:17:39.540,0:17:45.620
As Jesus gives food, satan too, has his own food.

0:17:45.620,0:17:52.480
His food lasts for now but God's food lasts for eternity.

0:17:52.480,0:17:56.920
This is why you can't receive blessing - as you receive it, it disappears.

0:17:56.920,0:18:01.580
You become a billionaire today, next year you become a poor man.

0:18:01.580,0:18:07.760
The peace I give, the money I give, and the food I am giving you ...

0:18:07.760,0:18:11.420
Not as the world gives you, not as satan gives them.

0:18:11.420,0:18:18.160
Satan will give you all this, looking like things I give you, but the difference is

0:18:18.160,0:18:22.080
at the time you need it most it disappears.

0:18:22.080,0:18:24.500
You see many in our times.

0:18:24.500,0:18:32.580
Some of the blessings you need now - at the time you need those blessing most - you cannot find them.

0:18:32.580,0:18:46.780
In summary: as it was with Job, with God's permission, you can be tempted.

0:18:46.780,0:18:57.680
As it was with Job, with God's permission, you can be attacked by satan.

0:18:57.680,0:19:02.400
If you look around and see; yes – I am follower of God, nothing is wrong.

0:19:02.400,0:19:05.540
An attack comes - you should know that God is aware.

0:19:05.540,0:19:07.420
God has knowledge of it

0:19:07.420,0:19:09.020
God allows it.

0:19:09.020,0:19:15.260
Let them come - promotion is about to come.

0:19:15.260,0:19:19.800
If God aware of what you are going through, what is happening to you,

0:19:19.800,0:19:29.820
yes, the question is – what does He want to prove?

0:19:29.820,0:19:36.780
Ask yourself, "What does He want to prove?"

0:19:36.780,0:19:40.200
Speak to yourself and speak out.

0:19:40.200,0:19:47.080
When you pray: Lord Jesus, I have a headache – heal me, and you are not healed.

0:19:47.080,0:19:49.360
You say you do not have faith.

0:19:49.360,0:19:56.220
You shouldn’t base your faith on the healing of your sickness.

0:19:56.220,0:20:00.340
You may not be healed, yet you have faith.

0:20:00.340,0:20:02.920
These are the challenges we are facing now.

0:20:02.920,0:20:15.460
We always base our faith on improvement of our prayer.

0:20:15.460,0:20:20.960
We base our faith on what?

0:20:20.960,0:20:23.460
Improvement of what?

0:20:23.460,0:20:24.620
A prayer.

0:20:24.620,0:20:30.360
If you pray and pray and your prayer is answered – you agree that you have faith.

0:20:30.360,0:20:34.300
If you pray and pray and your prayer is not answered – you do not have faith.

0:20:34.300,0:20:43.340
It honours God when we believe in Him when every sense contradicts Him.

0:20:43.340,0:20:48.220
When everything is not good and you still believe in Him, it honours Him more

0:20:48.220,0:20:52.280
than when everything is good and you believe in Him.

0:20:52.280,0:20:56.960
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:20:56.960,0:20:59.240
Are you with me?

0:20:59.240,0:21:08.480
It honours God most when you believe in Him when everything looks bad

0:21:08.480,0:21:13.880
than believing in Him when things look good.

0:21:13.880,0:21:19.200
You are in church today because everything seems to look bad,

0:21:19.200,0:21:27.200
but the moment things turn around, and you begin to count in thousands, trillion, houses, and other;

0:21:27.200,0:21:29.600
you will check your expensive watch,

0:21:29.600,0:21:35.020
you look at the time and say: no no Joshua, I can't sit here - it is too warm, too hot here.

0:21:35.020,0:21:39.040
But here it is not hot now. 
You are ready to sit down.

0:21:39.040,0:21:49.460
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:21:49.460,0:22:02.500
Now, you are here today and I believe next time you will come as an ex-loser.

0:22:02.500,0:22:06.220
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:22:06.220,0:22:10.520
Ex-loser.

0:22:10.520,0:22:14.980
You need to believe God.

0:22:14.980,0:22:20.600
The same way, if not more - the way you believe in Him now.

0:22:20.600,0:22:25.360
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:22:25.360,0:22:35.980
And also, always realize that your difficult situations and circumstances are the things satan uses

0:22:35.980,0:22:39.820
to drive you into sin.

0:22:39.820,0:22:43.380
You know, sin begins in our heart.

0:22:43.380,0:22:48.120
The war you are seeing today started from the heart.

0:22:48.120,0:22:55.760
The discussion: "we are going to do that…" before planning.

0:22:55.760,0:23:06.980
Therefore, the wrong or whatever you might have done started from your heart.

0:23:06.980,0:23:15.000
When satan uses our situation, our difficult circumstances to drag us into sin.

0:23:15.000,0:23:18.120
it means at that moment you are attacked -

0:23:18.120,0:23:20.720
whether it is a nightmare - when you wake up...

0:23:20.720,0:23:23.880
It is always difficult for you to pray.

0:23:23.880,0:23:30.420
When you wake up and you find that this is bad, this is a nightmare...

0:23:30.420,0:23:36.040
Even when you pray, you pray with a disturbed heart.

0:23:36.040,0:23:42.640
When you pray with a disturbed heart, you are not praying to God but to yourself.

0:23:42.640,0:23:44.260
That is an attack.

0:23:44.260,0:23:50.500
He uses those attacks to drag us into sin, to separate us from God,

0:23:50.500,0:23:56.800
to overthrow us from our position as a child of God.

0:23:56.800,0:23:59.560
Any time there is an attack,

0:23:59.560,0:24:03.640
if anyone tells you that because you are a Christian, you will not be attacked,

0:24:03.640,0:24:13.380
what of if God permits it, allows it, has knowledge of it or is aware?

0:24:13.380,0:24:18.500
So also, faith is your root to God.

0:24:18.500,0:24:22.960
There is nothing you can do with a root, unless you do not have that root at all.

0:24:22.960,0:24:28.940
It is your seed; it remains in you.

0:24:28.940,0:24:34.600
No matter how it fails, but not finally or totally.

0:24:34.600,0:24:36.980
May God bless His word.

0:24:36.980,0:24:43.320
Thank you.

0:24:43.320,0:24:46.180
How does this message apply to you?

0:24:46.180,0:24:48.180
Can somebody stand up to tell me?

0:24:48.180,0:24:49.480
I am a Christian for now.

0:24:49.480,0:24:53.500
Thank you. 
Clap for him.

0:24:53.500,0:24:55.800
He says he is a Christian.

0:24:55.800,0:24:59.560
Not only a Christian, but a born-again Christian.

0:24:59.560,0:25:01.880
- If I'm right...?
- You are right.

0:25:01.880,0:25:03.580
You can answer the question.

0:25:03.580,0:25:05.120
This message is an inspiration.

0:25:05.120,0:25:10.840
But as a Christian, before now - how did you handle the issue of faith?

0:25:10.840,0:25:12.320
You say you are a born-again.

0:25:12.320,0:25:15.460
What was your understanding of issue of faith?

0:25:15.460,0:25:16.400
Tell us how it was before now.

0:25:16.400,0:25:21.940
Before now - when I get something and get hurt, I get discouraged.

0:25:21.940,0:25:33.500
So with this message - it gives an inspiration that any temptation in life is a test, to prove my trust in God.

0:25:33.500,0:25:36.280
So, it permits to believe more in God.

0:25:36.280,0:25:38.180
There is a question you need to ask yourself:

0:25:38.180,0:25:41.840
when there is an attack or whatever you are facing, you need to ask yourself,

0:25:41.840,0:25:44.780
"Are you still a born again"?

0:25:44.780,0:25:48.840
If you can answer that question yourself: "I am a born-again" - good.

0:25:48.840,0:25:53.540
There is another question: "What does God want to prove?"

0:25:53.540,0:25:58.860
God wants to prove Himself as faithful, when I am facing temptation.

0:25:58.860,0:26:01.660
If I were to encourage myself with this message today,

0:26:01.660,0:26:06.340
which is an inspiration:  when I face temptation, I know that God wants to improve my life

0:26:06.340,0:26:09.760
through that trial to become a testimony in my life.

0:26:09.760,0:26:11.260
Thank you.

0:26:11.260,0:26:18.040
Never forget that it honours Him more to believe God when we are facing challenges.

0:26:18.040,0:26:23.880
Tell your neighbour.

0:26:23.880,0:26:36.780
It honours God more to believe in Him when we are facing difficult circumstances.

0:26:36.780,0:26:39.380
You want to improve your relationship with God.

0:26:39.380,0:26:42.020
That is the time to improve it.

0:26:42.020,0:26:43.900
Oh my God.

0:26:43.900,0:26:48.620
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:26:48.620,0:26:54.960
Every true Christian would like to improve their relationship with God.

0:26:54.960,0:26:59.320
No matter the level of your relationship with God, you want improvement.

0:26:59.320,0:27:07.600
You want to sleep and see visions, understand His voice, hear His voice in your heart,

0:27:07.600,0:27:15.560
God to talk to you and you to God, feel Him, reach that level, see visions,

0:27:15.560,0:27:19.960
you want to know God's opinion about yourself and about others.

0:27:19.960,0:27:27.940
Yet, although you are a true Christian you cannot tell people the opinion of God about others.

0:27:27.940,0:27:30.860
You do not even know the God's opinion about yourself.

0:27:30.860,0:27:33.360
What kind of Christian are you?

0:27:33.360,0:27:35.480
Thank you brother.

0:27:35.480,0:27:39.160
We are going to ask a different question entirely.

0:27:39.160,0:27:42.660
First of all tell us your position before God.

0:27:42.660,0:27:47.520
What do you understand about an attack now, if you are a Christian, Sir?

0:27:47.520,0:27:54.320
As a journalist I have a different opinion about what attack is all about.

0:27:54.320,0:27:58.740
I believe that an attack differs from one country to another.

0:27:58.740,0:28:05.400
The way you get attacked in the western world is different from the way you got attacked in Africa.

0:28:05.400,0:28:10.440
So I see attacks in Africa as more spiritual.

0:28:10.440,0:28:13.400
But the other world is just by the grace of God.

0:28:13.400,0:28:18.500
But I have a contrary opinion to what man of God has said before I got here.

0:28:18.500,0:28:21.580
As a journalist I was looking for news to write

0:28:21.580,0:28:27.600
But when you said something about Peter Simon - if Peter Simon who failed, who am I?

0:28:27.600,0:28:29.500
I am a mere mortal.

0:28:29.500,0:28:31.320
I can fail at any time.

0:28:31.320,0:28:34.600
OK, what my brother asked - I want somebody to answer this question.

0:28:34.600,0:28:39.440
What type of attacks or temptations are we talking about?

0:28:39.440,0:28:44.040
Any foolish thing that the devil can use against us.

0:28:44.040,0:28:49.160
Be it sickness, or children turning against you.

0:28:49.160,0:28:50.540
I want to thank you - thank you.

0:28:50.540,0:28:54.360
What do you understand about this so-called attack?

0:28:54.360,0:28:56.840
To me as a Christian and a born-again,

0:28:56.840,0:29:05.800
I believe that an attack is anything that would want me to react, or to diminish my faith in Christ.

0:29:05.800,0:29:11.740
And the way we react, or we want to defend ourselves during the attack really matters.

0:29:11.740,0:29:18.320
So, as a child of God when any attack comes we have to think, and we know that any attack -

0:29:18.320,0:29:26.800
it is a way God uses to have us much more faith in Him.

0:29:26.800,0:29:29.140
The SCOAN Saturday Service

0:29:29.140,0:29:34.480
What I learned through this message are two characteristics, of a true "born-again".

0:29:34.480,0:29:40.400
Number one is that we know a true "born-again" - when he misses the mark,

0:29:40.400,0:29:43.980
because naturally he comes back to repentance.

0:29:43.980,0:29:50.100
And second characteristics is that a true "born-again" can be attacked only when God permits it.

0:29:50.100,0:29:56.560
This is to improve his faith and make him come closer in his relationship with God.

0:29:56.560,0:29:59.380
And this will help him.

0:29:59.380,0:30:01.200
Thank you.

0:30:01.200,0:30:05.920
You listen what he said: there are two things that he said here.

0:30:05.920,0:30:10.680
When a truly born-again Christian is attacked, he will surely come back to repentance.

0:30:10.680,0:30:13.500
That is a true born-again. 
It comes naturally.

0:30:13.500,0:30:16.460
That you are a born-again does not mean you cannot be attacked

0:30:16.460,0:30:21.580
but the difference between you and those who are not born again is that when you are attacked,

0:30:21.580,0:30:24.060
you will come to repentance.

0:30:24.060,0:30:25.620
That is born-again.

0:30:25.620,0:30:30.000
Those who are not born-again when they attack them, they attack back

0:30:30.000,0:30:33.620
and continue to live that life of attack.

0:30:33.620,0:30:38.600
The attack they receive will make them to go deeper in the dark.

0:30:38.600,0:30:42.460
From one witch doctor to another…

0:30:42.460,0:30:48.340
They begin to point an "accuse finger", looking for his attacker.

0:30:48.340,0:30:56.120
A time of attack is a time of promotion, to improve your relationship with God.

0:30:56.120,0:31:01.420
Take note – when you are born-again, nothing can separate you from the love of God.

0:31:01.420,0:31:03.800
What is the love of God?

0:31:03.800,0:31:06.680
The love of God is the way of God.

0:31:06.680,0:31:09.660
The love of God is eternal life.

0:31:09.660,0:31:12.660
It is all about being a born-again.

0:31:12.660,0:31:16.600
You just need to check yourself if you are really a born-again.

0:31:16.600,0:31:20.460
How do we know we are born again?

0:31:20.460,0:31:21.460
Sit down Sir.

0:31:21.460,0:31:25.540
Can somebody tell me how do you know you are a born-again?

0:31:25.540,0:31:29.140
How do you know you are born-again?

0:31:29.140,0:32:06.540
Uzbekistan - speaker.

0:32:06.540,0:32:12.360
She says she is from Uzbekistan, and when she was coming here she was attacked

0:32:12.360,0:32:17.860
and her bank card was blocked, but she went into prayer and said,

0:32:17.860,0:32:21.000
"Lord this is your will, and if you want me to be there I will be there".

0:32:21.000,0:32:26.740
So, she received it, she humbled herself and the Lord opened a way for her to come here.

0:32:26.740,0:32:39.640
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:32:39.640,0:32:41.840
It is not only while coming here.

0:32:41.840,0:32:48.760
Even if you apply for a job and that job would benefit you,

0:32:48.760,0:32:56.460
and your life depends on that job, and it is a destine job.

0:32:56.460,0:33:03.000
Immediately you think about applying the attack starts.
