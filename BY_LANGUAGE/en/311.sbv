0:00:00.000,0:00:02.720
{Madam, can I help you?}

0:00:03.460,0:00:04.080
Yes, sir.

0:00:04.740,0:00:06.600
{You shouldn't surrender just like that,}

0:00:06.820,0:00:07.660
Okay sir.

0:00:07.800,0:00:10.220
{It's too quick for you to just say, "No, you have surrendered"}

0:00:10.220,0:00:12.220
Thank you sir!

0:00:13.000,0:00:17.120
{What happened is a matter of settlement 
let them settle the matter.}

0:00:17.700,0:00:18.640
Yes sir!

0:00:22.640,0:00:23.940
{You are the fault.}

0:00:23.940,0:00:24.580
Yes sir,

0:00:25.160,0:00:26.680
{You know you are the fault.}

0:00:26.680,0:00:27.180
How?

0:00:29.220,0:00:31.120
All my friend said was true,

0:00:31.120,0:00:33.120
and what I did to my family.

0:00:34.040,0:00:36.560
The things I did to my family are all true.

0:00:39.020,0:00:42.580
My name is Chidiebere Agba
and this is my family.

0:00:43.980,0:00:46.960
I'm a native of a Anambra state, 
Nigeria.

0:00:47.820,0:00:52.360
Last week Sunday, the man of God 
came to me and prophesied that

0:00:53.160,0:00:56.240
I shouldn't surrender, that is all about settlement.

0:00:56.980,0:00:59.580
He also said I am at fault.

0:00:59.580,0:01:01.580
{You shouldn't surrender just like that.

0:01:02.400,0:01:05.620
Its too quick for you to just say no!
you have surrendered. Okay?

0:01:05.620,0:01:08.340
Thank you sir,

0:01:08.780,0:01:12.660
What happened is a matter of settlement
 let them settle the matter.

0:01:13.180,0:01:14.460
Thank you sir.

0:01:17.860,0:01:19.098
{You are the fault?}

0:01:19.098,0:01:19.860
Yes, sir!

0:01:20.380,0:01:22.340
{You know you're the fault?}

0:01:22.600,0:01:23.420
Which is true.

0:01:24.180,0:01:28.720
I've grown up to be a sadist
 among the society,

0:01:29.780,0:01:32.140
but when the force come, 
I can't control myself.

0:01:33.320,0:01:36.700
It all started when I was in Madona;
 a missionary school.

0:01:38.360,0:01:43.149
My intention was to go to that school
 afterwards, I would go into a convent.

0:01:43.700,0:01:47.154
But when I entered I met other things inside the school.

0:01:47.460,0:01:50.240
As a missionary school, we were not meant to go out,

0:01:51.340,0:01:54.420
but we always jumped the fence and go clubbing;

0:01:55.580,0:01:57.920
that's when I was in my SS1

0:01:57.920,0:02:00.929
We clubbed from there, and that was when we started

0:02:00.929,0:02:02.640
clubbing and hanging out with

0:02:03.260,0:02:04.880
university graduates.

0:02:05.280,0:02:07.280
Before I graduated from Madonna,

0:02:07.640,0:02:12.980
me and one of my friend,
 we never like seeing people happy.

0:02:13.640,0:02:16.460
Whenever we see some friends talking,

0:02:16.560,0:02:19.160
my friend would call me and ask, "why are these girls

0:02:19.160,0:02:20.800
they eating and going to the canteen together?"

0:02:22.200,0:02:25.980
Then, they wouldn't say anything,
 but everything runs into my mind

0:02:26.080,0:02:29.324
I'll call one of them out, and say some things

0:02:29.324,0:02:32.780
if she's not buying to my idea, I will leave.

0:02:34.120,0:02:37.720
Some weeks after I would go to the friends corner,

0:02:37.720,0:02:39.700
any night when I want to ease myself,

0:02:39.760,0:02:41.260
I must penetrate people's corner.

0:02:42.520,0:02:46.380
I'll take what belongs to one friend, 
and plant  in the other girl's bag.

0:02:47.560,0:02:48.760
and lock it bag.

0:02:49.480,0:02:52.020
And then I happen to be a prefect in the school.

0:02:52.020,0:02:54.460
I started handling posts in my SS3

0:02:55.240,0:02:57.320
Then I was the assistant social prefect,

0:02:58.380,0:03:01.100
when they call for prefect meeting,

0:03:01.100,0:03:05.260
I'll make a suggestion, 
and that suggestion goes to my plan.

0:03:06.019,0:03:08.019
Went the person is found out

0:03:08.269,0:03:09.696
she's being disgraced and

0:03:09.696,0:03:11.979
sometimes brought to panel in the school.

0:03:12.980,0:03:14.528
Once you're being caught like three

0:03:14.528,0:03:16.209
times in a missionary school stealing,

0:03:16.790,0:03:18.900
You're being expelled from the school.

0:03:18.900,0:03:22.540
Which some people has been expelled all for my sake.

0:03:25.160,0:03:27.729
Afterwards, I grew up with that

0:03:29.180,0:03:31.560
My parents in their hands

0:03:31.560,0:03:34.223
we're the best people that 
ever happened to me.

0:03:34.223,0:03:36.319
They made sure I have 
whatever I wanted.

0:03:37.410,0:03:40.249
Before the visiting 
day they sent whatever I wanted,

0:03:41.120,0:03:43.680
such as 2 sets of provision.

0:03:44.160,0:03:48.280
But I would never eat it, 
I kept it and take it home to them.

0:03:48.940,0:03:50.580
I didn't touch my provision.

0:03:50.960,0:03:54.400
Rather, I took from People,I never took mine.

0:03:54.820,0:03:56.900
I rather send mine back to my family.

0:03:58.280,0:04:00.840
When I take my girlfriend's provision,

0:04:00.840,0:04:02.940
I planted it in another person's bag.

0:04:05.340,0:04:07.795
My guardian in school, flogged me one day,

0:04:07.800,0:04:09.140
and I set her up too.

0:04:10.740,0:04:13.300
Because I didn't like someone correcting me.

0:04:14.400,0:04:16.400
Before I left Madona, something happened.

0:04:17.040,0:04:19.340
There was a day I went for clubbing

0:04:19.340,0:04:21.020
my parents never told me they were

0:04:21.020,0:04:23.360
visiting and it surprised me.

0:04:24.060,0:04:26.060
I was not in the school premises.

0:04:27.000,0:04:31.280
They called me, my girlfriend 
never told me when she was returning,

0:04:31.280,0:04:33.599
she came back without my notice

0:04:33.600,0:04:38.280
and I was still in the campus in Okwa, Nnamdi azikiwe university.

0:04:39.120,0:04:41.120
Hanging out with those guys,

0:04:42.300,0:04:45.600
So when my parents called I returned back

0:04:45.600,0:04:47.691
when they had left and they were very angry

0:04:47.691,0:04:49.550
and the school punished me on that.

0:04:50.340,0:04:52.459
The only friend I called friend,

0:04:53.400,0:04:54.650
I could never hurt her,

0:04:54.720,0:04:57.920
but because of what she did and
 my parents were angry with me,

0:04:58.880,0:05:00.390
I hurt her to the core.

0:05:00.780,0:05:02.300
When I left this school

0:05:02.880,0:05:04.880
that continues,

0:05:06.000,0:05:08.929
I could never respect you no 
matter who you think you were

0:05:10.260,0:05:13.000
No one corrected me, but the only

0:05:13.000,0:05:15.620
person I listened to at times was my father.

0:05:16.890,0:05:19.309
My mother could not even stand me,

0:05:20.160,0:05:22.760
I insulted her and walk out of her.

0:05:23.460,0:05:25.820
I could only hear the voice of my father.

0:05:26.970,0:05:28.970
I didn't know why.

0:05:29.010,0:05:32.333
So I grew up with this, I was very good in making friends,

0:05:32.333,0:05:34.339
but I couldn't last with you in two days.

0:05:35.100,0:05:37.549
Highest I can last with a friend is just one week.

0:05:38.360,0:05:40.360
And we would  have serious issues.

0:05:41.920,0:05:47.300
so this continued, I took from people and plant it in others,

0:05:47.720,0:05:49.720
so that the person would be embarrassed.

0:05:50.680,0:05:53.900
Recently, I didn't do that to people,

0:05:54.140,0:05:56.660
rather, I kept for myself.

0:05:58.120,0:06:00.040
The  reason why the man of God
 said I need to settle,

0:06:00.480,0:06:03.920
is because I'm not in good terms 
with any of my friend or family.

0:06:04.620,0:06:06.620
I was meant to serve in Abuja,

0:06:07.380,0:06:11.560
but I left Abuja because of 
what happened in the camp.

0:06:12.560,0:06:13.720
My very good friend,

0:06:13.820,0:06:15.480
the only good friend that stood by me,

0:06:15.480,0:06:17.480
the only girl that believed me.

0:06:17.880,0:06:20.360
That  can worship me, 
she would wash my clothes

0:06:20.440,0:06:22.320
and does everything for me.

0:06:23.620,0:06:25.720
On a sit out, I took her phone

0:06:26.100,0:06:29.179
switched it off, I even personally reported the case

0:06:29.180,0:06:30.600
to the camp commandant.

0:06:31.760,0:06:33.520
That I needed to find that phone,

0:06:33.520,0:06:35.740
because the camp commandant was my friend.

0:06:36.320,0:06:39.060
He went round in the whole camp,

0:06:39.060,0:06:41.200
searching the camp looking for that phone.

0:06:41.280,0:06:42.900
I was the hostel leader

0:06:43.560,0:06:45.100
I helped him to look for that phone

0:06:45.100,0:06:47.220
even in my own bag although It was inside my bag.

0:06:48.240,0:06:49.354
I opened my provision,

0:06:49.354,0:06:51.530
I put it inside the milk and sealed it back

0:06:52.560,0:06:54.560
Nobody could find it,

0:06:54.740,0:06:56.920
until when my brother came to visit me.

0:06:58.160,0:06:59.500
This is my brother.

0:07:00.240,0:07:02.960
All these continued, all my brothers

0:07:03.720,0:07:05.220
could never help me out,

0:07:05.740,0:07:07.560
ever since I started this.

0:07:07.920,0:07:10.520
But this my brother here was the only one that stood by me.

0:07:11.550,0:07:14.960
No matter what I did, he still pay my bills.

0:07:15.660,0:07:17.660
Whatever I wanted - to make sure I don't lack.

0:07:20.160,0:07:23.840
But there was something I did one day, and he beats me,

0:07:24.630,0:07:27.590
I got angry and vowed to destroy him.

0:07:28.280,0:07:31.160
Which is the only girl he ever loved.

0:07:31.540,0:07:34.480
I said a lot of things about him to the girl that

0:07:34.760,0:07:36.500
he is infected with disease.

0:07:36.500,0:07:38.040
That a girl should stay off.

0:07:38.680,0:07:42.700
I even tried to take the girl's phone to see if I can get a parents number,

0:07:43.100,0:07:45.100
But I couldn't.

0:07:48.020,0:07:49.560
I didn't know what else to do,

0:07:49.560,0:07:54.640
when I was in the camp I took that phone I sold it to him.

0:07:56.160,0:07:58.060
I wanted to give him what I told him,

0:07:58.060,0:07:59.359
"I don't have money you know I'm just a student,

0:08:00.200,0:08:02.040
give me money for the phone,"

0:08:02.040,0:08:02.580
I gave it to him.

0:08:03.880,0:08:04.980
And the person in question

0:08:05.340,0:08:09.300
happened to be my close friend, she's always in my house 24/7.

0:08:10.020,0:08:12.540
We eat together, she stay with my parents,

0:08:12.540,0:08:14.800
she enters my brother's room, they chat.

0:08:15.660,0:08:18.000
I knew definitely she's going to see the phone there.

0:08:18.860,0:08:22.060
I wished she caught him with the phone and  embarrass him.

0:08:22.540,0:08:23.740
This my brother

0:08:24.500,0:08:27.200
He dealt with me seriously that day.

0:08:27.740,0:08:29.600
I never knew what came to me,

0:08:30.140,0:08:33.540
but then, they never knew what I was doing until now.

0:08:34.080,0:08:36.650
I tried to make him have a serious accident,

0:08:37.280,0:08:39.880
I tried to open his fuel tank,

0:08:39.880,0:08:41.860
but I don't know its always locked.

0:08:43.170,0:08:44.660
Bonnet, I can open it.

0:08:44.660,0:08:47.773
So what I did every early in the morning,

0:08:47.773,0:08:51.949
if my parents remember the dog 
always back as early as four.

0:08:52.620,0:08:55.280
There is this particular knife, I always sleep with it.

0:08:55.280,0:08:56.929
I come out and punch the tires.

0:08:58.200,0:09:00.470
Whenever he is driving, he has a flat tire.

0:09:01.410,0:09:03.384
That continued, and one day my mum said,

0:09:03.384,0:09:05.599
"this quarrel you are having with your brother,

0:09:05.850,0:09:09.050
he is suspecting you that you
 are the one punching his tires."

0:09:09.810,0:09:11.869
I didn't know where to hot damage his car,

0:09:11.870,0:09:14.140
I just wanted to see him pained,

0:09:14.140,0:09:17.900
because he gave me scratch in my body. -blood drops

0:09:18.020,0:09:20.420
I wanted his own blood to flow

0:09:20.420,0:09:21.880
that was why I wanted to do that.

0:09:22.320,0:09:25.000
But there was no way I could 
plant anything into his car.

0:09:25.000,0:09:26.450
but to punch his tires.

0:09:28.820,0:09:31.220
That is what happened, 
the last one that happened

0:09:31.220,0:09:33.920
my parents had to come over to bail me out.

0:09:33.960,0:09:37.460
And they told me, they will
 never do it like that again.

0:09:38.430,0:09:42.074
This continued, but after this phone incident,

0:09:42.074,0:09:44.450
I was so ashamed of myself.

0:09:45.080,0:09:46.940
One other thing I did was,

0:09:48.220,0:09:51.740
When I sat out with a guy, he may see me and like me.

0:09:52.600,0:09:55.080
I was not interested in dating.

0:09:55.080,0:09:58.220
He can pass and see me and pack his car

0:09:58.220,0:10:01.020
to test me, my revenge would be to pick his phone,

0:10:01.580,0:10:02.840
take the number that I know

0:10:02.840,0:10:04.660
maybe his wife's number and save it.

0:10:06.330,0:10:07.795
Instead of sending you the text,

0:10:07.795,0:10:09.259
I would forward the text to her.

0:10:09.930,0:10:13.400
To the wife, "I'm waiting for you, where are you?"

0:10:13.400,0:10:16.699
so that she gets offended and you people have issues.

0:10:17.600,0:10:21.260
That is the only thing I did, just to make you feel bad.

0:10:22.140,0:10:23.580
And my sister here,

0:10:25.160,0:10:28.860
she's a very good person, she does business.

0:10:29.180,0:10:30.580
She sells men clothes.

0:10:31.740,0:10:33.748
But when I saw she was really moving up,

0:10:33.748,0:10:34.880
when I went to her house

0:10:34.880,0:10:36.720
and she was telling me that she has people

0:10:36.720,0:10:37.804
to meet - customers.

0:10:37.804,0:10:38.780
I would say, "very good,

0:10:39.540,0:10:41.370
let me wait for you,"

0:10:41.370,0:10:44.239
It hurt me when people turned my offer down.

0:10:44.610,0:10:47.600
She would tell me that she 
wants to lock down her house

0:10:47.600,0:10:51.259
I would think, "is she feeling that
 I want to steal her things?"

0:10:51.590,0:10:55.340
I would say okay, 
where are you doing your supply?

0:10:55.340,0:10:58.939
And she would tell me where
 she is going.

0:10:58.940,0:11:00.660
I would say, "Okay I'm off I'm going home."

0:11:00.660,0:11:02.680
either to my house or to my family house.

0:11:03.420,0:11:06.800
I'm very known so when I enter anywhere,

0:11:06.800,0:11:08.659
I will go and spoil that market for her.

0:11:09.420,0:11:11.260
Some people are even owing her,

0:11:11.260,0:11:13.880
They can't pay her anymore, all because of what I said.

0:11:14.280,0:11:16.980
I would make sure I give the number out to the wife,

0:11:16.980,0:11:18.380
I would look for the wife of that man and tell her.

0:11:18.560,0:11:21.120
"My sister is not selling clothes for your husband rather

0:11:21.120,0:11:23.060
she's busy sleeping with him."

0:11:23.790,0:11:26.599
Just to afflict pain on her and her business.

0:11:27.780,0:11:32.280
I just don't just like to see people. Happy.

0:11:34.980,0:11:36.880
Despite that, my family still stood by me.

0:11:36.880,0:11:38.690
{Why don't you want to see people happy?}

0:11:39.480,0:11:42.589
Its the evil spirit in me, I was just a sadist.

0:11:43.200,0:11:45.893
I don't actually see me and husband together,

0:11:45.893,0:11:47.030
I am always alone.

0:11:47.060,0:11:49.877
I don't know why they would always stop me,

0:11:49.877,0:11:52.039
but I don't want to date them.

0:11:52.800,0:11:55.040
however, they keep pestering me,

0:11:55.040,0:11:58.249
so what I did was just to bring problem for them and go.

0:11:59.190,0:12:02.059
I caused them to have issues in their homes.

0:12:03.360,0:12:07.060
The truth is that, when I was in secondary school,

0:12:07.620,0:12:10.920
I was passing through things, and when my friends

0:12:12.060,0:12:15.380
introduced me to following men

0:12:15.380,0:12:18.800
and they would mess you up 
and just leave you out.

0:12:18.800,0:12:22.320
I vowed, even still vows that
 I would never  want to get married,

0:12:22.940,0:12:24.940
But people kept coming.

0:12:25.500,0:12:27.740
That is why I didn't  want to see anyone marrying.

0:12:27.740,0:12:29.460
None of my friend can open their mouth

0:12:29.460,0:12:31.000
and tell me they're getting married.

0:12:31.000,0:12:34.040
I would spoil that relationship.

0:12:34.400,0:12:35.544
If she tells me the guy,

0:12:35.544,0:12:39.120
I would tell her, "You have to watch 
this guy very well, he is a womanizer."

0:12:40.230,0:12:42.259
Instead of me to encourage them.

0:12:42.960,0:12:46.920
Being her friend, She would take me to the guy's house,

0:12:47.620,0:12:50.060
Later. I would  go back and spoil for her.

0:12:50.060,0:12:52.050
I would rather introduce her to another man,

0:12:52.140,0:12:53.280
and when she's with a man,

0:12:53.380,0:12:55.880
I would take photos of her and their conversation

0:12:55.880,0:12:58.560
and send it to the man that wants to get married to her.

0:12:59.580,0:13:02.720
And that's how  they kept breaking up in their relationship.

0:13:03.680,0:13:08.460
{Can you see, why you should examine everything,

0:13:08.680,0:13:10.860
whatever you hear about your husband,

0:13:11.620,0:13:14.600
no matter how serious the issue is,

0:13:15.360,0:13:17.460
Whatever you hear about your wife,

0:13:17.460,0:13:19.640
no matter how serious the issue is.

0:13:20.780,0:13:22.820
You need to ask God.

0:13:24.780,0:13:26.780
You need to find out the truth

0:13:28.200,0:13:31.840
50% of the marriages today are divorced,

0:13:31.840,0:13:35.240
based on this fetish lie.

0:13:36.240,0:13:38.599
My father is a contractor

0:13:39.510,0:13:41.510
and he is will respected in my church.

0:13:42.330,0:13:45.580
But because of this, he hardly get any job,

0:13:45.580,0:13:47.380
people insult him in the public.

0:13:48.560,0:13:50.020
When he come back home,

0:13:50.020,0:13:50.840
he is always in tears.

0:13:51.540,0:13:53.880
When my father is sad,  I ask him, "what is the problem?"

0:13:53.880,0:13:55.020
He wouldn't tell me

0:13:55.740,0:13:57.401
but later when he is scolding me,

0:13:57.401,0:13:58.600
he would mention it out.

0:14:00.060,0:14:02.620
Those that are owing him in the last job he did,

0:14:03.440,0:14:04.660
when he ask them for money,

0:14:05.020,0:14:08.140
they would say, "go and ask 
your daughter to steal and give him."

0:14:08.600,0:14:12.280
So that has brought a lot of shame to the family,

0:14:12.280,0:14:15.640
Even my mom is even suffering from high blood pressure,

0:14:15.930,0:14:17.790
all because of me.

0:14:17.790,0:14:20.829
Those are the things that made me leave Abuja,

0:14:20.829,0:14:24.400
because I could not  stand watching my family in shame.

0:14:24.940,0:14:27.080
I couldn't  even walk on the streets,

0:14:27.440,0:14:29.440
my friends called me names.

0:14:29.700,0:14:33.700
Man of God  all I ask is 
for your help and to deliver me.

0:14:34.120,0:14:38.040
{How many year has this 
spirit been tormenting you?}

0:14:38.040,0:14:39.920
Since I was in secondary school

0:14:39.920,0:14:42.040
I know all these things started in my JSS3

0:14:42.140,0:14:45.060
after I was given the post of the assistant regulator.

0:14:45.680,0:14:47.080
that is when I grew up with this,

0:14:47.760,0:14:50.740
(12- 15 years) now I have been with this.

0:14:50.740,0:14:52.160
But I can't control myself,

0:14:52.500,0:14:54.840
when things are being done
 after like 30 minutes

0:14:54.840,0:14:56.260
I get myself back.

0:14:56.700,0:14:59.360
But there was no way  I could
  apologize to those people,

0:14:59.360,0:15:00.200
I would rather move on

0:15:00.930,0:15:03.919
{Since the Spirit of God fetched you out,

0:15:05.220,0:15:08.180
I will not allow you to go unless you are delivered.

0:15:11.300,0:15:12.820
Tell us what lesson you have?}

0:15:13.700,0:15:16.740
All I would say is that some times

0:15:17.840,0:15:20.120
Single-sex school is very bad,

0:15:20.490,0:15:24.589
female school is very bad
 because you meet a lot of things.

0:15:25.200,0:15:29.200
Your school mother can keep 
as a sex machine.

0:15:30.140,0:15:33.940
A lot of things goes on there,  
either you can meet lesbians,

0:15:34.800,0:15:38.659
People who encourage you not to follow men,
 rather you be with them.

0:15:40.700,0:15:47.080
Another one, I would always 
advise my fellow girls and others.

0:15:47.080,0:15:49.620
Try to appreciate those who are happy

0:15:49.640,0:15:54.860
and be happy with them rejoice with 
them and don't be a sadist.

0:15:55.280,0:15:59.200
Because right now, I am really regretting all my acts.

0:16:00.840,0:16:04.280
{You know, you have never
 regretted like this before?}

0:16:05.120,0:16:07.420
No, I've never .

0:16:08.250,0:16:10.250
{To the extent of crying,

0:16:11.730,0:16:13.880
this is to tell you that the end has come.}

0:16:20.140,0:16:22.680
{I want to appeal to the family also

0:16:22.680,0:16:26.340
to a extend the hand of deliverance towards them,

0:16:26.740,0:16:29.480
and because I know the lady has affected

0:16:29.480,0:16:31.860
not only the society but the family.

0:16:31.860,0:16:34.560
She has affecting them negatively.

0:16:34.920,0:16:38.280
talk about the father or the brother or sister,

0:16:39.940,0:16:41.740
listen to what our sister has said.

0:16:41.740,0:16:45.440
It's a lesson to everyone of
 us - big lesson.

0:16:45.840,0:16:47.080
May God help us!}
