0:00:10.520,0:00:17.100
Viewers all over the world, I say "Good Morning" to you.

0:00:17.100,0:00:18.300

0:00:51.200,0:00:55.720
And also to share with you some of the present challenges.

0:00:55.720,0:00:58.680
They are everywhere; it is everywhere!

0:00:58.680,0:01:00.660
Where can we go from these challenges?

0:01:00.660,0:01:01.560
(Nowhere!)

0:01:01.560,0:01:02.600
I can't hear you

0:01:02.600,0:01:03.880
(Nowhere!)

0:01:03.880,0:01:06.620
It is epidemic.

0:01:06.620,0:01:08.860
I don't know where you can go from these challenges.

0:01:08.860,0:01:13.360
Even if you go underground, the challenges are there.

0:01:13.360,0:01:19.280
If you decided to go inside the sea, you will find challenges there.

0:01:19.280,0:01:25.700
Air? Oh my God! You will see clouds covering you.

0:01:25.700,0:01:28.000
Everywhere are challenges.

0:01:28.000,0:01:33.200
You choose to go inside the bush; you will see challenges there.

0:01:33.200,0:01:38.680
I want to say, it is the season; the season of challenges.

0:01:38.680,0:01:45.400
How do these challenges relate to our Christian life?

0:01:45.400,0:01:51.640
Your challenges could be this or that; you know the kind of challenges you have.

0:01:51.640,0:01:54.700
There is no one without challenges.

0:01:54.700,0:01:59.140
Yes, I mean there is no one without limitations.

0:01:59.140,0:02:05.720
Okay? So everyone, everyone, everyone, just everyone.

0:02:05.720,0:02:09.500
It is impossible to live without challenges.

0:02:09.500,0:02:10.600
Tell your neighbour.

0:02:10.600,0:02:13.480
(It is impossible to live without challenges.)

0:02:13.480,0:02:14.580
I can't hear you

0:02:14.580,0:02:16.960
(It is impossible to live without challenges.)

0:02:16.960,0:02:21.700
It is impossible to live without challenges.

0:02:21.700,0:02:24.120
Where can you go from these?

0:02:24.120,0:02:31.980
So, how do these challenges relate to your Christian life?

0:02:31.980,0:02:36.940
Does it mean you are not a Christian? Or what does this mean? Having challenges?

0:02:36.940,0:02:41.140
The type of challenges you have is not the type of challenges I have.

0:02:41.140,0:02:46.180
The area you have challenges is not the area I have mine.

0:02:46.180,0:02:57.240
When we talk  of challenges, knowledge is not the key; obedience is.

0:02:57.240,0:02:58.700
When we talk of what?

0:02:58.700,0:02:59.980
(Challenges)

0:02:59.980,0:03:04.260
Knowledge is not the key - because you apply knowledge.

0:03:04.260,0:03:06.400
That cannot work.

0:03:06.400,0:03:12.800
Knowledge is not the key, but obedience is.

0:03:12.800,0:03:22.420
Challenges determine where you are spiritually.

0:03:22.420,0:03:24.960
Viewers, are you there?

0:03:24.960,0:03:35.480
Yes, listen to me: Challenges determine where you are spiritually.

0:03:35.480,0:03:43.020
This is why knowledge is not the key; obedience is.

0:03:43.020,0:03:45.280
What do I mean?

0:03:45.280,0:03:53.480
Challenges reveal the true condition of man's heart.

0:03:53.480,0:04:01.340
When you see someone who is very quiet, gentle - this reminds me of one of my evangelists.

0:04:01.340,0:04:07.540
When he first came to join us, people said, "This man is very quiet".

0:04:07.540,0:04:10.720
Indeed, he was very quiet and smiley.

0:04:10.720,0:04:14.800
People said, "Oh, he is nice". Everybody wanted to rally around him.

0:04:14.800,0:04:18.580
I said, "Wow! No, it is too early".

0:04:18.580,0:04:26.880
Let's pose challenges and see whether he will remain  the same.

0:04:26.880,0:04:34.180
Okay, go and accuse him wrongly - just any accusation.

0:04:34.180,0:04:40.000
"Come on! You stole my money! You stole my money!"

0:04:40.000,0:04:44.260
"You mean I stole your money? What are you saying?"

0:04:44.260,0:04:51.940
"I said you stole my money! I saw you! I am going to report you to the man of God!"

0:04:51.940,0:05:00.600
The two of them rushed to my office, and I knew what they were talking about because we started it.

0:05:00.600,0:05:03.120
I said, "Okay, okay, you people should come".

0:05:03.120,0:05:07.200
The gentleman was just coming; immediately his face changed.

0:05:07.200,0:05:11.220
A gentleman that they said he's too gentle, very nice, changed!

0:05:11.220,0:05:17.240
He became wild and said to me, "I swear in the name of Jesus!"

0:05:17.240,0:05:20.780
I said, "No, don't swear! Don't use the name of Jesus to swear.

0:05:20.780,0:05:24.640
But they say you are very quiet; you are very nice".

0:05:24.640,0:05:30.480
"Aaah no, no! I'm nice but I can't just allow somebody to lie against me. This is stupid!

0:05:30.480,0:05:32.480
You lady - you are an idiot!"

0:05:32.480,0:05:36.500
I said, "Can you see someone you said is very quiet and gentle?"

0:05:36.500,0:05:38.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:38.000,0:05:44.760
I said to them, "Look, there's nothing like you have stolen money.

0:05:44.760,0:05:50.240
Everyone says that you are very quiet and gentle and you are a 'messiah' and I said to them

0:05:50.240,0:05:55.660
they should pose a challenge to you and see whether you remain a 'messiah'.

0:05:55.660,0:06:00.000
Can you see now you are not gentle? You are pretending!"

0:06:00.000,0:06:05.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:05.320,0:06:20.180
Challenges determine where you are spiritually, reveal the true condition of a man's heart.

0:06:20.180,0:06:26.840
So let me take you to the book of Hebrews 5.

0:06:26.840,0:06:32.300
I will take my reading from verse 1 and later we can go to the proof text.

0:06:32.300,0:06:42.660
"Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters

0:06:42.660,0:06:51.680
related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.

0:06:51.680,0:07:00.640
He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray,

0:07:00.640,0:07:04.820
since he himself is subject to weakness.

0:07:04.820,0:07:13.680
This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people."

0:07:13.680,0:07:19.520
Lets take you to verse 7 and 8.

0:07:19.520,0:07:30.440
"During the days of Jesusâ€™ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears

0:07:30.440,0:07:37.900
to the one who could save him from death, the one who could save him from death

0:07:37.900,0:07:42.000
with crying and what? Tears.

0:07:42.000,0:07:49.000
Jesus was heard because of his reverent submission.

0:07:49.000,0:07:50.500
Verse 8

0:07:50.500,0:08:02.700
Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered."

0:08:02.700,0:08:19.700
Though Jesus was a Son of God, He learned obedience by the things He suffered.

0:08:19.700,0:08:30.620
He went through agony, anguish and physical pain.

0:08:30.620,0:08:35.340
The Bible says "reverent submission".

0:08:35.340,0:08:43.720
That is, He submitted to the revealing Word of God.

0:08:43.720,0:08:50.540
Jesus submitted to the revealing Word of God.

0:08:50.540,0:08:59.140
This means spiritual growth is a function of obedience to the will of God.

0:08:59.140,0:09:12.000
And this will take us to the title: KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE KEY, OBEDIENCE IS

0:09:12.000,0:09:25.800
In 1 Peter 4:1, Jesus suffered for us in the flesh.

0:09:25.800,0:09:32.720
He suffered for us in the flesh.

0:09:32.720,0:09:44.280
If Jesus suffered for us in the flesh, we should arm ourselves with the same manner,

0:09:44.280,0:09:48.760
the same attitude, the same mind.

0:09:48.760,0:09:58.380
The Bible says, "For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin".

0:09:58.380,0:10:05.380
He who has suffered from the flesh has ceased from what? (Sin) From sin.

0:10:05.380,0:10:09.200
That is, stopped sinning.

0:10:09.200,0:10:17.060
Jesus learned obedience by the things He suffered.

0:10:17.060,0:10:25.120
We learn obedience by the difficult challenges we face today.

0:10:25.120,0:10:33.440
Tell your neighbour, "Learn obedience by the difficulty you face today".

0:10:33.440,0:10:35.000
I can't hear you.

0:10:35.000,0:10:38.000
[Learn obedience by the difficulty you face today.]

0:10:38.000,0:10:39.800
I can't hear you.

0:10:39.800,0:10:42.140
[Learn obedience by the difficulty you face today.]

0:10:42.140,0:10:49.000
What are the difficulties you are facing - those challenges?

0:10:49.000,0:10:54.820
Our situations are tests to mature us.

0:10:54.820,0:11:01.000
Tell your neighbour, "My situations are tests to mature me".

0:11:01.000,0:11:03.000
I can't hear you.

0:11:03.000,0:11:05.280
[My situations are tests to mature me.]

0:11:05.280,0:11:11.500
My challenges are tests to mature me.

0:11:11.500,0:11:17.180
What are your challenges? What is your situation?

0:11:17.180,0:11:19.000
That is a question you need to ask yourself.

0:11:19.000,0:11:23.420
What are your challenges? What is your situation as a Christian?

0:11:23.420,0:11:27.240
They are tests to mature you.

0:11:27.240,0:11:35.100
Whatever situations you are facing, don't allow them to control you.

0:11:35.100,0:11:43.860
When your situation controls you, you will lose all sense of reasoning.

0:11:43.860,0:11:47.040
This is what is happening to you today.

0:11:47.040,0:11:56.280
Everyone that is better than you - they are criminals, they are corrupt people, they are thieves.

0:11:56.280,0:12:01.240
When you don't have a vehicle and you are on your way and you see a posh car - they are criminals,

0:12:01.240,0:12:03.740
they are the ones carrying our money!

0:12:03.740,0:12:09.360
Because we have lost sense of what? Reasoning.

0:12:09.360,0:12:15.520
When poverty comes and you allow poverty to control you, hardship to control you,

0:12:15.520,0:12:22.980
those who are better than you in terms of money, wealth - they are your enemy.

0:12:22.980,0:12:30.100
When you allow your depression to control you, those who are happy - they are your enemy.

0:12:30.100,0:12:34.120
When you allow your sickness to control you, those who are not sick - they are your enemy.

0:12:34.120,0:12:37.060
When they laugh, you feel irritated.

0:12:37.060,0:12:44.220
And when you are not sick and you are healthy, if you allow your good health to control you as well,

0:12:44.220,0:12:52.000
those who are sick - you will think as a result of their sin comes sickness.

0:12:52.000,0:12:55.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:55.140,0:13:11.500
2 Timothy 3:7 says, we are "always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".

0:13:11.500,0:13:20.540
Sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial and temptation.

0:13:20.540,0:13:26.380
Where there is no heat of challenges, sin easily hides.

0:13:26.380,0:13:32.420
Just as impurity hides in gold until it goes into processing.

0:13:32.420,0:13:34.460
You know gold.

0:13:34.460,0:13:39.620
The impurity on that gold must be removed before it becomes gold.

0:13:39.620,0:13:53.700
So in the same way, sin, iniquity, easily hides where there is no heat of challenges, trial, temptation, trouble.

0:13:53.700,0:14:03.880
In time of prosperity and success, you will see the evil one rejoicing and rejoicing.

0:14:03.880,0:14:12.500
But when the heat of trials and temptations comes, their evil action surfaces.

0:14:12.500,0:14:14.400

0:14:14.400,0:14:18.560
No matter how much you master the Scripture...

0:14:18.560,0:14:22.840
The Bible - which many of us are using today as a cover up.

0:14:22.840,0:14:30.000
We hide under the knowledge of the Bible to deceive the world that you are a Christian,

0:14:30.000,0:14:35.000
you are a Bishop, you are a Prophet, you are Archbishop - whatever name you call yourself.

0:14:35.000,0:14:38.700
We are hiding under the knowledge of the Bible.

0:14:38.700,0:14:44.760
And knowledge is not the key; obedience is

0:14:44.760,0:14:51.700
No matter how much you master the Scripture,

0:14:51.700,0:15:03.440
without true obedience to what you read, you still wear spiritual diapers.

0:15:03.440,0:15:10.360
We continue to learn and come to church from far and wide

0:15:10.360,0:15:18.500
to hear this message of God, and many of us live with Emmanuel TV.

0:15:18.500,0:15:20.240
We live with what?

0:15:20.240,0:15:21.620
(Emmanuel TV)

0:15:21.620,0:15:26.180
Yes. That is, as I am talking now, some of us turn it on in our bedroom.

0:15:26.180,0:15:30.460
Our children put it on all the time

0:15:30.460,0:15:32.700
We live with it.

0:15:32.700,0:15:39.280
Yet, we never mature because of disobedience.

0:15:39.280,0:15:44.740
Knowledge is not the key; obedience is.

0:15:44.740,0:15:47.100
Tell your neighbour.

0:15:47.100,0:16:00.760
We continue learning, coming to church from far and wide, to hear the message of the Gospel,

0:16:00.760,0:16:09.780
yet we never mature because of disobedience.

0:16:09.780,0:16:14.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:14.840,0:16:17.340
Maturity is all about Christ.

0:16:17.340,0:16:25.220
When you are not mature, you are ignorant and ignorance is a sin.

0:16:25.220,0:16:34.140
When you are not mature, you react intellectually to the the things of God.

0:16:34.140,0:16:42.020
You react by what you see and you think it is godly way to do that.

0:16:42.020,0:16:44.820
You react by what you hear.

0:16:44.820,0:16:47.420
"Eeeh, eeh, you said this to me!?"

0:16:47.420,0:16:53.740
"You mean? My wife? My wife did this? You saw my wife there?"

0:16:53.740,0:16:56.000
"Yes, I saw your wife there!"

0:16:56.000,0:17:01.600
And you would not know that they want to scatter your marriage!

0:17:01.600,0:17:07.860
It is easy to destroy those who are not mature. If you are not mature, you are just food to satan.

0:17:07.860,0:17:13.300
Any time they see you happy, they will go into a corner and make a phone call to you.

0:17:13.300,0:17:17.240
"This man is happy; let me give him unhappiness!"

0:17:17.240,0:17:18.700
They now will give you phone call.

0:17:18.700,0:17:19.500
"Hello?"

0:17:19.500,0:17:27.340
"Yes, you see, I saw your wife. The place I saw your wife is very, very bad."

0:17:27.340,0:17:31.380
"I am telling you; you know it is bad."

0:17:31.380,0:17:34.000
"Ehn ehn, where?"

0:17:34.000,0:17:36.700
"This place, that place."

0:17:36.700,0:17:42.420
"Aaaah, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."

0:17:42.420,0:17:48.200
You drop the phone and you say,  [Crying] "I loved this woman! I loved her!

0:17:48.200,0:17:55.340
I don't know why she would behave like this to me!" You want to commit suicide.

0:17:55.340,0:17:58.800
Those who have committed suicide - 50% of them -

0:17:58.800,0:18:02.760
they act ignorantly -

0:18:02.760,0:18:10.960
what they hear, what they see, what their circumstances look like.

0:18:10.960,0:18:14.640
So, these are the weapons against immature Christians.

How you react when you are under pressure and how you react when you are under those challenges...

0:18:59.500,0:19:12.820
You will see the way you react is how the real you reacts.

0:19:12.820,0:19:19.360
It's how the real you reacts. Say, "How I react".

0:19:19.360,0:19:25.980
How I react under pressure - I mean, under challenges - I mean, under your problem...

0:19:25.980,0:19:36.520
I don't know the condition you are in - maybe hardship, sickness, debt or hardship.

0:19:36.520,0:19:42.220
How you react is how the real you reacts.

0:19:42.220,0:19:47.140
And the real you is the one serving God, not you.

0:19:47.140,0:19:55.920
You are here today because you have transport to come to the church or you are able to fuel your car.

0:19:55.920,0:20:03.860
Assume, you have no money to fuel your car, you will likely send your children to church and sit at home

0:20:03.860,0:20:07.200
because you do not want to be shamed by people around you.

0:20:07.200,0:20:10.720
You have forgotten that the same God that gave you the vehicle,

0:20:10.720,0:20:13.900
that gave you the car when you were nobody before

0:20:13.900,0:20:19.080
and the Lord now gave you the vehicle - you are now using the same vehicle against Him!

0:20:19.080,0:20:22.880
By looking at the way people dance,  you will know who is this man!

0:20:22.880,0:20:26.480
Whether he is coming to give testimony or he is coming with trouble.

You see some dances; they will do like this.

0:20:32.520,0:20:36.540
While some dance, they will say, "Hallelujah, hallelujah".

0:20:36.540,0:20:39.000
You know that satan has hit him.

Trials and temptations determine where you are spiritually.

0:20:50.200,0:21:01.680
How you react under pressure, how you react under your situation, is how the real you reacts.

Let me believe today's message blessed your soul. Knowledge is not the key; obedience is.

You just need to take your time. Meditate on it.

A person can be sick in body and yet be a Christian, a friend of God, and a favorite of Jesus.

0:22:37.000,0:22:41.300
Don't measure your Christian life by your situation.

0:22:41.300,0:22:44.740
Don't allow your situation to mislead you.

0:22:44.740,0:22:47.000
