0:00:00.000,0:00:03.820
Good Morning!

0:00:03.820,0:00:06.580
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:06.580,0:00:09.040
Hallelujah!

0:00:09.040,0:00:12.760
Let me just give you a message from the heart.

0:00:12.760,0:00:16.280
When you look at the whole thing,

0:00:16.280,0:00:25.200
Christianity has become just a surface - human wisdom.

0:00:25.200,0:00:31.080
Christianity seems to be human wisdom.

0:00:31.080,0:00:36.920
There is no difference any longer between Christianity and religion.

0:00:36.920,0:00:41.460
So even when you listen to the news or whatever comment,

0:00:41.460,0:00:48.320
they classify them as religion.

0:00:48.320,0:00:53.580
Christianity is not a religion.

0:00:53.580,0:01:05.400
Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.

0:01:05.400,0:01:12.540
He came to restore this relationship.

0:01:12.540,0:01:18.240
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:01:18.240,0:01:21.680
It is all about the Word of God in our heart.

0:01:21.680,0:01:22.580
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:22.580,0:01:25.200
[It is all about the Word of God in our heart.]

0:01:25.200,0:01:26.340
I can't hear you.

0:01:26.340,0:01:28.820
[It is all about the Word of God in our heart.]

0:01:28.820,0:01:34.680
Today, Christianity has turned to the Word of God in our mouth.

0:01:34.680,0:01:39.860
People believe that they should just confess, "I am a Christian". Simple.

0:01:39.860,0:01:45.420
Your neighbourhood knows you are coming to the church

0:01:45.420,0:01:55.740
and consequently that you are a Christian, a believer - are you such in heart?

0:01:55.740,0:01:58.740
That is the question you need to ask.

0:01:58.740,0:02:14.960
Because you carry a Bible, a Cross, bear Joshua, Timothy, Deborah - are you such in heart?

0:02:14.960,0:02:23.280
If you are such in heart, that is the work of faith the Bible is talking about.

0:02:23.280,0:02:27.480
"Amen!" Are you such in heart?

0:02:27.480,0:02:32.640
"In the name of Jesus!"
Are you such in heart?

0:02:32.640,0:02:36.020
"Thank You, Jesus!"
Are you such in heart?

0:02:36.020,0:02:39.000
That is what Christianity is all about.

0:02:39.000,0:02:42.720
That is what Jesus is interested in.

0:02:42.720,0:02:47.800
That is what pleases Jesus.

0:02:47.800,0:02:51.260
You are in the church.
Are you such in heart?

0:02:51.260,0:02:56.260
Are you telling me your spirit is inside the church?

0:02:56.260,0:03:00.020
Let us quickly look at the Book of Colossians Chapter 3:

0:03:00.020,0:03:04.920
"Living as those made alive in Christ.

0:03:04.920,0:03:15.740
Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is,

0:03:15.740,0:03:19.040
seated at the right hand of God.

0:03:19.040,0:03:30.240
Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."

0:03:30.240,0:03:33.560
Let me take you to verse 23.

0:03:33.560,0:03:52.040
"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart,

0:03:52.040,0:04:07.560
as working for the Lord, not for human masters,

0:04:07.560,0:04:18.220
since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward..."

0:04:18.220,0:04:22.800
Take your time to read that Colossians' Book,

0:04:22.800,0:04:29.780
1 Chronicles 28:9,

0:04:29.780,0:04:34.680
James 4:3,

0:04:34.680,0:04:43.660
and Luke 16:15 when you get home.

0:04:43.660,0:04:49.340
Here you are in the church.

0:04:49.340,0:04:53.540
Are you such in heart?

0:04:53.540,0:04:59.100
Because Christianity lies in the heart.

0:04:59.100,0:05:18.160
Jesus looks at our motive behind our action but men look at the action.

0:05:18.160,0:05:24.680
You are sitting down, you are laughing - that is all what man can see

0:05:24.680,0:05:32.260
but Jesus looks at the motive behind your sitting.

0:05:32.260,0:05:47.260
I mean, Jesus looks at why you do what you do but men look at what you do.

0:05:47.260,0:05:50.420
T.B. Joshua.

0:05:50.420,0:05:53.140
But the motive behind it...

0:05:53.140,0:05:56.520
That is what Christianity is all about.

0:05:56.520,0:06:07.120
You believe God that it will rain - you go ahead and plant crops.

0:06:07.120,0:06:16.600
That is what Christianity is all about.

0:06:16.600,0:06:30.140
I believe it will rain and I go ahead and plant crops without waiting for the rain.

0:06:30.140,0:06:49.680
People see you as a Christian because you are called Joshua, Timothy, Deborah, Esther,

0:06:49.680,0:06:59.400
you go to church as a pastor, Christian, bishop, prophet

0:06:59.400,0:07:06.880
and you have sound knowledge of the Scripture;

0:07:06.880,0:07:16.240
but don't forget: A man may be a Christian but not such in heart.

0:07:16.240,0:07:24.540
A man may have sound knowledge of the Bible and not such in heart.

0:07:24.540,0:07:43.660
In 1 Chronicles 28:9, the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intents of the thoughts.

0:07:43.660,0:07:48.900
If you are not such in heart, how do you speak to God; how will God speak to you?

0:07:48.900,0:07:57.180
Because the Bible says, the Word of God in our heart is our contact with God.

0:07:57.180,0:08:08.000
Let someone say, "The Word of God in our heart is our contact with God".

0:08:08.000,0:08:10.820
It is His contact with us too.

0:08:10.820,0:08:12.820
"You want to speak to me?" -

0:08:12.820,0:08:16.340
the Word of God in my heart will contact.

0:08:16.340,0:08:21.820
I want to speak to Him - the Word of God in my heart.

0:08:21.820,0:08:24.720
How do you speak to God when you are not such in heart?

0:08:24.720,0:08:29.560
You have been dancing since morning. Are you such in heart?

0:08:29.560,0:08:56.940
Whatever your heart engages on influences your conduct and your character.

0:08:56.940,0:09:16.560
If your heart does not contact the Word of God, nothing can be achieved in God.

0:09:16.560,0:09:33.280
You can be seen as a Christian because you are often seen with a big Bible and big Cross

0:09:33.280,0:09:48.620
but God does not see you as such because of the motive behind your being a Christian.

0:09:48.620,0:09:51.640
The new year is about...

0:09:51.640,0:09:54.920
You cannot continue this way.

0:09:54.920,0:10:00.360
If you continue this way without God's Word in your heart -

0:10:00.360,0:10:03.820
people see you as a Christian whereas you cannot contact God

0:10:03.820,0:10:08.220
and God cannot contact you - what kind of Christian is this?

0:10:08.220,0:10:11.480
You cannot contact God and God cannot contact you.

0:10:11.480,0:10:17.140
The only means, the only grace to contact you is that Word in your heart

0:10:17.140,0:10:23.220
but where is that Word in your heart?

0:10:23.220,0:10:38.080
The next year is not going to be this year in attitude, character, challenges, trial, condition.

0:10:38.080,0:10:47.500
Tell your neighbour, "Man has to power to testify, witness about Christ".

0:10:47.500,0:10:50.780
A man can say, "Jesus is Lord! Jesus is the Redeemer!

0:10:50.780,0:10:58.420
Jesus is the Healer! Whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life".

0:10:58.420,0:11:11.340
Man has that power but the Holy Spirit testifies, witnesses.

0:11:11.340,0:11:25.600
Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.

0:11:25.600,0:11:29.940
So, read your Bible with devotion.

0:11:29.940,0:11:48.380
Discover what God has to say to you each day.

0:11:48.380,0:11:57.300
Tell your neighbour, "Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him".

0:11:57.300,0:11:58.440
Again.

0:11:58.440,0:12:02.240
[Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.]

0:12:02.240,0:12:06.900
So, read your Bible with devotion.

0:12:06.900,0:12:21.880
When you see someone who is doing good, very nice, don't be in a haste to see him as good

0:12:21.880,0:12:31.580
because you don't know his motive.

0:12:31.580,0:12:37.860
This is what they have been using to deceive you - you politicians - all over the world.

0:12:37.860,0:12:40.940
"Okay, I will do this, I will do that."

0:12:40.940,0:12:45.420
They give you food, they give you everything, they campaign...

0:12:45.420,0:12:51.780
But when they get to the position, they change.

0:12:51.780,0:12:58.180
"I will do this!" - you follow them, "Hey!"

0:12:58.180,0:13:04.440
You will build a school; you will do this; you will improve the school, the economy.

0:13:04.440,0:13:08.200
All over the world you see, "Hey!"

0:13:08.200,0:13:13.940
Food, bring money out to the city, share money, give everyone - and you follow.

0:13:13.940,0:13:19.120
By the time they get there, the story changes.

0:13:19.120,0:13:26.220
When you see someone who is doing good and is loving,

0:13:26.220,0:13:35.660
don't be in a haste because you don't know his motive.

0:13:35.660,0:13:42.240
When you see someone who is preaching the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,

0:13:42.240,0:14:04.420
claiming to witness for Christ, let us take our time before calling him a pastor or Christian

0:14:04.420,0:14:09.720
because you don't know his motive.

0:14:09.720,0:14:20.560
Jesus' focus is the motive behind what we do - what you do and why you do it.

0:14:20.560,0:14:22.680
That is His focus.

0:14:22.680,0:14:33.580
His focus is the motive behind what we do and why we do it,

0:14:33.580,0:14:38.500
what you say and why you say it.

0:14:38.500,0:14:41.740
That is His focus.

0:14:41.740,0:14:45.740
Many of us have been deceived when it comes to relationships

0:14:45.740,0:14:50.820
because a man is very nice, a woman is nice, caring and loving -

0:14:50.820,0:14:56.060
"Oh, you have forgotten; this is a nice person."

0:14:56.060,0:15:04.060
But as time goes on, the story changes.

0:15:04.060,0:15:08.860
Man has the power to decide.

0:15:08.860,0:15:11.880
You can decide to just walk out of this place.

0:15:11.880,0:15:15.140
The Spirit of God will not grab you and say, "No, don't go!"

0:15:15.140,0:15:22.000
You can decide as we are talking, "No, no, what this man is saying, I can't stand it" and walk out

0:15:22.000,0:15:26.300
and the Spirit of God, Jesus, will not say, "No, come back"; He will leave you to go.

0:15:26.300,0:15:32.500
That is discretion given to everyone.

0:15:32.500,0:15:38.180
That is why Jesus asked the man at the pool of Bethesda,

0:15:38.180,0:15:42.800
"What will I do for you? What do you want me to do?"

0:15:42.800,0:15:48.180
He said, "No, I have been here for many years; no one to carry me to the pool".

0:15:48.180,0:15:50.640
"What do you want me to do now?"

0:15:50.640,0:15:57.700
If the man said, "No, no, don't talk to me; go your way!", Jesus would leave him.

0:15:57.700,0:16:00.100
That is discretion.

0:16:00.100,0:16:05.380
The man said, "Please, help me".

0:16:05.380,0:16:09.860
Man has the power to decide.

0:16:09.860,0:16:15.320
You can decide to pray which many of us have been doing,

0:16:15.320,0:16:18.720
just when you have a problem - "Jesus!"

0:16:18.720,0:16:23.220
You can decide to pray early morning; it is a normal routine.

0:16:23.220,0:16:27.060
You wake up early in the morning - "Oh, children, let us pray."

0:16:27.060,0:16:36.980
"In the name of Jesus" - you are the one praying; Jesus does not know.

0:16:36.980,0:16:52.140
Exercising the will through the mind but the Holy Spirit has the power of choice.

0:16:52.140,0:16:58.060
Jesus tests our heart to reward us.

0:16:58.060,0:16:59.400
Tell your neighbour.

0:16:59.400,0:17:02.100
[Jesus tests our heart to reward us.]

0:17:02.100,0:17:03.220
I can't hear you.

0:17:03.220,0:17:05.600
[Jesus tests our heart to reward us.]

0:17:05.600,0:17:12.180
All this running helter skelter, "I'm a pastor, I'm a Christian, I'm this",

0:17:12.180,0:17:19.540
carrying this, all this appearance, all this shouting, "Hey!",

0:17:19.540,0:17:24.340
praying, fasting, "Hey, my God!", going to the mountain -

0:17:24.340,0:17:28.000
they say, "He is a prayer warrior; he is this, that".

0:17:28.000,0:17:34.980
Jesus tests our heart to reward us.

0:17:34.980,0:17:39.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:39.500,0:17:49.320
The question remains - are you such in heart?

0:17:49.320,0:17:54.820
What is your motive?

0:17:54.820,0:18:01.860
Jesus tests our heart to give us according to our efforts.

0:18:01.860,0:18:03.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:18:03.080,0:18:11.100
Jesus tests our heart to give us according to our efforts.

0:18:11.100,0:18:12.400
I can't hear you.

0:18:12.400,0:18:16.800
[Jesus tests our heart to give us according to our efforts.]

0:18:16.800,0:18:19.740
What is the state of your heart?

0:18:19.740,0:18:28.420
Your heart must be at its best because the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father

0:18:28.420,0:18:35.120
expresses Himself through your heart.

0:18:35.120,0:18:45.200
The Spirit of God expresses Himself through your heart.

0:18:45.200,0:18:50.560
All this, "In the name of Jesus!" - are you such in heart?

0:18:50.560,0:18:52.880
"Amen!!"
Are you such in heart?

0:18:52.880,0:18:56.500
"Let us pray!"
Are you such in heart?

0:18:56.500,0:19:01.220
Are you such in heart?

0:19:01.220,0:19:05.620
This is why it is always difficult to go through trials.

0:19:05.620,0:19:11.980
No one can go through trials without the Word in the heart.

0:19:11.980,0:19:16.180
No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!", without the Word in the heart.

0:19:16.180,0:19:17.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:17.220,0:19:20.480
[No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!", without the Word in the heart.]

0:19:20.480,0:19:23.560
So, where are we going?

0:19:23.560,0:19:28.480
And I'm very very sure - that is why I'm saying this -

0:19:28.480,0:19:34.500
a lot of percentage in our midst here are not such in heart.

0:19:34.500,0:19:37.360
That is why I'm bitter.

0:19:37.360,0:19:54.720
For you to go to the New Year - with the trials, tribulations, situations I am seeing that are coming -

0:19:54.720,0:20:08.640
you need the Word of God in your heart to contact Jesus.

0:20:08.640,0:20:17.040
Tell your neighbour, "I need the Word in my heart to contact Jesus".

0:20:17.040,0:20:26.740
It is the Word Jesus also uses to contact you - the Word in your heart.

0:20:26.740,0:20:31.540
What I'm looking at, I'm looking round -

0:20:31.540,0:20:37.420
if you are my neighbour, I will know;

0:20:37.420,0:20:41.760
if you share the same inheritance, I will know;

0:20:41.760,0:20:45.000
if you are my family, I will know.

0:20:45.000,0:20:49.000
I can see.

0:20:49.000,0:20:59.040
This is just celebration - percentage of us here.

0:20:59.040,0:21:15.320
For how long shall we continue this - trials, persecution, tribulation?

0:21:15.320,0:21:25.600
No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!" genuinely without the Word in the heart.

0:21:25.600,0:21:26.620
Genuinely.

0:21:26.620,0:21:36.400
Anybody can say, "Jesus is Lord!" - you don't need license for that - but genuinely...

0:21:36.400,0:21:40.380
Genuinely.

0:21:40.380,0:21:43.580
So, rise up and let us pray.

0:21:43.580,0:21:50.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:50.480,0:21:58.780
I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:21:58.780,0:22:04.760
The Holy Spirit is at the door of your heart.

0:22:04.760,0:22:09.080
Say, "My heart, awake!"

0:22:09.080,0:22:22.680
The Holy Spirit is at the door of my heart - awake!

0:22:22.680,0:22:25.500
Yes.

0:22:25.500,0:22:36.440
The Holy Spirit is there knocking, saying, "Awake!"

0:22:36.440,0:22:38.600
That is, open the door.

0:22:38.600,0:22:44.020
The Holy Spirit is at the door of your heart right now!

0:22:44.020,0:22:59.980
I say to your heart, "Awake!"

0:22:59.980,0:23:03.880
In Jesus' name!

0:23:03.880,0:23:16.120
Committing the Word of God to memory is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.

0:23:16.120,0:23:17.160
Tell your neighbour.

0:23:17.160,0:23:32.800
Committing the Word of God to memory is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.

0:23:32.800,0:23:41.300
Learning the history of the Book of the Bible is valuable.

0:23:41.300,0:23:45.500
You can be a lecturer, you can teach, you can get your daily bread,

0:23:45.500,0:23:56.360
getting money - it is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.

0:23:56.360,0:24:03.200
Say, "In the name of Jesus!" - where is Jesus because the Word is not from your heart.

0:24:03.200,0:24:06.520
My heart, hear the voice of God.

0:24:06.520,0:25:13.340
My heart hear the voice of God
My heart hear the voice of Holy Spirit

0:25:13.340,0:25:22.400
Let there be freedom
Let there be rest

0:25:22.400,0:25:38.820
In my heart in my mind
And in my soul in Jesus' name

0:25:38.820,0:25:52.640
Let there be freedom
Let there be rest in my heart

0:25:52.640,0:25:53.960
Did you listen to that?

0:25:53.960,0:25:56.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:56.640,0:26:05.900
When you pray, you do not receive; when you ask, you do not receive

0:26:05.900,0:26:12.000
because you pray and ask with wrong motives.

0:26:12.000,0:26:14.200
That is why you don't receive.

0:26:14.200,0:26:16.660
I'm not surprised.

0:26:16.660,0:26:18.460
Many of you just let...

0:26:18.460,0:26:24.240
It is a normal life - we have to pray in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening.

0:26:24.240,0:26:26.900
You just pray, not that...

0:26:26.900,0:26:33.200
You pray, you do not receive; you ask, you do not receive

0:26:33.200,0:26:37.200
because you ask with wrong motives.

0:26:37.200,0:26:42.020
'Wrong motive' could be - there is no Word in your heart

0:26:42.020,0:26:47.320
and the Word in our heart makes us Christians.

0:26:47.320,0:26:50.380
The Word of God in our heart makes us Christians.

0:26:50.380,0:26:55.800
The Word of God in our heart is our contact with Jesus.

0:26:55.800,0:27:01.240
It is His contact with us.

0:27:01.240,0:27:04.360
So, now you need this Word.

0:27:04.360,0:27:07.060
Now you are about to enter the new year.

0:27:07.060,0:27:11.220
By the time you leave here, you know the next thing to do.

0:27:11.220,0:27:17.180
It is not to go to the party; you are to work on your spiritual life.

0:27:17.180,0:27:20.600
You can see the reason now.

0:27:20.600,0:27:27.440
For someone to be saying he is a Christian, whereas Jesus Himself does not know.

0:27:27.440,0:27:33.660
It is not in the record that you are a Christian; you are a religious person.

0:27:33.660,0:27:39.000
Nothing makes us Christians but the Word in our heart.

0:27:39.000,0:27:44.940
The Word in our heart is our contact.

0:27:44.940,0:27:47.100
"Hello."

0:27:47.100,0:27:51.780
And the Lord will say, "Hi, what do you want?"

0:27:51.780,0:27:56.380
The Word in your heart.

0:27:56.380,0:28:12.180
That is why you must have freedom, a free heart - a heart without a grudge.

0:28:12.180,0:28:16.380
We have damaged our heart.

0:28:16.380,0:28:25.620
Nursing a grudge, nursing bad feelings towards others damages our heart.

0:28:25.620,0:28:26.460
Tell your neighbour.

0:28:26.460,0:28:47.860
Nursing a grudge, pain of the past, bitterness, envy, jealousy, bad feelings towards others,

0:28:47.860,0:28:54.740
damages our heart.

0:28:54.740,0:28:58.700
The same heart is the contact point.

0:28:58.700,0:29:07.220
The Bible says the Spirit of the Father expresses Himself through our heart

0:29:07.220,0:29:11.240
and the heart we are talking about is damaged.

0:29:11.240,0:29:15.920
You have to begin to repair your heart.

0:29:15.920,0:29:24.080
The Spirit of the Father expresses Himself through our heart and the same heart is damaged.

0:29:24.080,0:29:31.580
Nursing a pain of the past, grudge, bad feelings towards others.

0:29:31.580,0:29:34.220
You say, "No, I will not agree."

0:29:34.220,0:29:41.160
Nursing an unforgiving spirit damages the heart.

0:29:41.160,0:29:43.440
So, you can see now.

0:29:43.440,0:29:47.020
So, you have to work now; you have a lot of work to do

0:29:47.020,0:29:50.220
because I do not want you to enter a new year with all this.

0:29:50.220,0:29:55.220
And you continue to say, it is witches and wizards;

0:29:55.220,0:29:57.440
your partner is the one attacking you.

0:29:57.440,0:30:01.700
Nobody attacked you; you are the one that damaged your heart.

0:30:01.700,0:30:07.020
There is no landing for God; there is no point for God to talk to you.

0:30:07.020,0:30:09.020
There must be a point.

0:30:09.020,0:30:13.820
"Hello."

0:30:13.820,0:30:16.960
Through what? - Heart.

0:30:16.960,0:30:23.320
The Word in the heart is our contact with God.

0:30:23.320,0:30:31.120
It is His contact with us but the heart is damaged.

0:30:31.120,0:30:37.140
Tell your neighbour, "Forgive them!"

0:30:37.140,0:30:40.920
I'm not saying, "Forgive him"; I said, "Forgive them!"

0:30:40.920,0:30:47.820
Say, "Forgive them and move forward!"

0:30:47.820,0:30:57.780

So, let us pray for our nation, your country, your continent.

0:31:04.240,0:31:08.200
Your flag, any contact you have - raise it up!

0:31:08.200,0:31:16.900
Ask God to redeem your nation and leaders, in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:31:16.900,0:31:18.160
I can't hear you.

0:31:18.160,0:31:19.860
[Amen.]

Prayer For The Nations
With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:31:29.860,0:31:49.880
Open your lips - ask God to redeem your country, nation, leaders,

0:31:49.880,0:31:52.680
in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:31:52.680,0:31:53.360
[Amen.]

0:31:53.360,0:31:54.560
I can't hear you.

0:31:54.560,0:31:56.280
[Amen.]

0:31:56.280,0:32:00.360
Right now, commit your journey of righteousness -

0:32:00.360,0:32:04.000
ask God to continue to strengthen you.

0:32:04.000,0:32:07.700
Because when you leave here, you continue the journey of righteousness.

0:32:07.700,0:32:13.800
With the message you have received today - journey of righteousness,

0:32:13.800,0:32:20.180
journey of uprigntness, journey of holiness.

0:32:20.180,0:32:24.320
Ask God to strengthen you.

0:32:24.320,0:32:34.200
Ask God to strengthen you in your journey of righteousness, uprightness, holiness,

0:32:34.200,0:32:42.640
faithfulness, obedience, humility and love.

0:32:42.640,0:32:49.320
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:32:49.320,0:32:53.480
Strengthen me, Lord.

0:32:53.480,0:33:00.660
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:33:00.660,0:33:07.920
Don't forget, Christianity lies in the heart.

0:33:07.920,0:33:15.840
Whatever you do, whatever you say must be such in heart.

0:33:15.840,0:33:21.480
I pray the Lord gives you an obedient heart, in Jesus' name!

0:33:21.480,0:33:22.500
Thank you.
