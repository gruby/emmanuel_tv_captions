Let us listen to what Prophet T.B. Joshua said about the Kenyan elections on Sunday 1st January, 2017.

0:00:08.780,0:00:11.400
Let us hear the voice of God.

0:00:11.400,0:00:15.540
Thank you, sir. You have answered all of my questions as to why I am here.

0:00:15.540,0:00:25.260
Now, since 2017 is a wonderful year, I love my nation, Kenya, and we are having elections.

0:00:25.260,0:00:30.680
I am asking that God visits me in dreams, so that I know how to pray about my nation.

0:00:30.680,0:00:32.680
God bless you, sir.

0:00:32.680,0:00:36.800
You want to take me back to what I have written.

0:00:36.800,0:00:44.560
Even your country is one of the countries that is inside the paper there.

0:00:44.560,0:00:48.980
If I may tell you just a bit of what is inside that paper.

0:00:48.980,0:00:54.480
They will be very, very close like this

0:00:54.480,0:00:57.620
and it will be difficult to call.

0:00:57.620,0:01:00.160
I will not say more than that.

0:01:00.160,0:01:06.340
Can you see? When something is close like this, and it will be difficult to call...

0:01:06.340,0:01:09.780
So, I don't want to go back to what is in the paper

0:01:09.780,0:01:11.500
because it's one of the things in the paper.

0:01:11.500,0:01:16.840
It will be very close like this -

0:01:16.840,0:01:19.200
the opposition and the ruling.

0:01:19.200,0:01:22.220
It will be very, very difficult to call.

0:01:22.220,0:01:25.520
From there - I will not be able to say more than that.

0:01:25.520,0:01:27.400
I am not here for that now.

0:01:27.400,0:01:30.140
So, therefore, what can you expect from there?

0:01:30.140,0:01:31.900
So, I will see you. Thank you.

0:01:31.900,0:01:36.480
So, you love your nation so much?
