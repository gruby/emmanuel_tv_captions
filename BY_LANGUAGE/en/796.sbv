0:00:00.000,0:00:03.880
God is still saying something.

0:00:03.940,0:00:05.100
Holy Spirit, we thank You.

0:00:05.100,0:00:06.460
Give thanks to God.

0:00:06.470,0:00:10.260
Give thanks to Him.

0:00:10.260,0:00:15.220
I want us to lift up our voice and pray this
coming Thursday.

0:00:15.300,0:00:21.420
Whatever that will happen that will cause
a conflict between the superpower nations.

0:00:21.420,0:00:30.260
Because I see a situation where one will tempt the other and that will provoke the whole thing

0:00:30.420,0:00:31.880
This coming Thursday.

0:00:31.880,0:00:34.990
Please, raise up your voice and begin to pray.

0:00:34.990,0:00:40.550
Pray that God should hold their temper, no
matter the temptation from the other side,

0:00:40.550,0:00:42.600
to another country.

0:00:42.600,0:00:49.440
The other country they tempted should hold
its temper - and should not be provoked to retaliate.

0:00:49.500,0:00:57.220
Then, if they retaliate - well, me and you
- our fate is hung.

0:00:57.280,0:00:58.640
Raise up your hand.

0:00:58.649,0:01:07.509
This coming Thursday, Friday - pray that whatever
that will happen that will cause any nation,

0:01:07.509,0:01:15.299
one of the super-nations to be provoked, to
retaliate - the Lord should hold their temper.

0:01:15.300,0:01:22.420
No matter what happens, hold your temper.

0:01:35.260,0:01:44.260
Father, You are the Lord that created all things.

0:01:44.300,0:01:46.940
You can loose, You can bind.

0:01:47.040,0:01:54.140
Whatever that will happen this coming Thursday
and Friday, that will cause other nations

0:01:54.200,0:01:57.499
to be tempted to lose their temper...

0:01:57.500,0:02:00.040
If one is tempted, it's attack.

0:02:00.040,0:02:03.500
And the other may lose their temper; that
is it.

0:02:03.560,0:02:06.720
Father, hold their temper.

0:02:06.729,0:02:14.220
Let them be calm; we ask for calmness.

0:02:14.220,0:02:23.340
We ask for calmness, in the name of Jesus
Christ!

0:02:23.340,0:02:26.860
This is what I saw in 2015 and 2016.

0:02:26.860,0:02:33.780
I said, "The fight in Syria will provoke other
fights."

0:02:33.800,0:02:37.480
They are playing it now and I said, "The Lord
should save us."

0:02:37.480,0:02:40.120
I was crying.

0:02:40.120,0:02:43.500
This coming Thursday and Friday are key days.

0:02:43.500,0:02:47.049
Please fast from morning until 12 midday.

0:02:47.049,0:02:50.920
I know all the nations and people that watch
Emmanuel TV.

0:02:50.920,0:02:54.860
When it happens, they will say, 'Ah, this
man said we should hold our temper'.

0:02:54.860,0:03:01.840
For the sake of peace, for the sake of harmony
in the world.

0:03:01.849,0:03:10.370
What is on the ground now is a devil's workshop.

0:03:10.370,0:03:15.220
The foundation for a devil's workshop is on
the ground.

0:03:15.220,0:03:20.600
We are talking of economic meltdown but another
one entirely.

0:03:20.600,0:03:23.660
With what is happening now, we cannot talk
of economic meltdown.

0:03:23.660,0:03:29.540
Whatever you see, you should eat it and talk
about your safety.

0:03:29.540,0:03:30.760
That is it.

0:03:30.760,0:03:33.220
We continue to pray, since God has shown us.

0:03:33.220,0:03:36.540
We will see; God will intervene.
