For some time now, I've had a message for my country, South Africa.

0:00:04.800,0:00:11.620
I would have loved to share it with them because I had this message last November.

0:00:11.620,0:00:22.280
Some areas of South Africa will face drought - the time of rain, it will not rain.

0:00:22.280,0:00:27.100
Even if it should rain, it will look like it hasn't rained.

0:00:27.100,0:00:29.220
But they should not worry.

0:00:29.220,0:00:38.820
I am seeing January, February, March to April - we are praying for rain.

0:00:38.820,0:00:42.780
March to April - to recover the city back.

0:00:42.780,0:00:50.200
There are some parts of cities like North-East, Limpopo and others.

0:00:50.200,0:00:53.040
The rain will fall!

0:00:53.040,0:00:58.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:58.080,0:01:04.460
Next meeting, I will have time to share my vision with them.

0:01:04.460,0:01:09.900
There are two challenges they have now that will affect the country so badly:

0:01:09.900,0:01:15.120
power and drought.

0:01:15.120,0:01:17.720
What is the cause of this?

0:01:17.720,0:01:30.420
It's unusual - a country the other Africans in the past saw as Heaven on earth.

0:01:30.420,0:01:34.980
When there is no power, what else again?

0:01:34.980,0:01:40.740
It affects the companies and the foreigners will start leaving

0:01:40.740,0:01:45.880
because they cannot work or stay without power.

0:01:45.880,0:01:49.800
I saw this and I'm praying over it.

0:01:49.800,0:01:54.600
The issue of rain -

0:01:54.600,0:01:59.500
this February, March - by April,

0:01:59.500,0:02:04.040
you will recover your water back.

0:02:04.040,0:02:08.420
Three years ago, I said they should have a dam.

0:02:08.420,0:02:13.760
It is part of the prophecy that South Africa should prepare to have a dam.

0:02:13.760,0:02:18.800
But I think they took it for granted.

0:02:18.800,0:02:20.000
Thank you very much.
