Let's offer this prayer.

0:00:03.460,0:00:14.660
Ask God to give you the grace not to be ignorant of your faith

0:00:14.660,0:00:21.300
under pressure of temptation, sickness and disease.

0:00:21.300,0:00:22.520
Ask God to give you the grace.

0:00:22.520,0:00:26.580
Give me the grace, Lord, not to be ignorant of my faith

0:00:26.580,0:00:41.760
under the pressure or tension of temptation, sickness, disease, hardship and setback.

Whatever you are facing under that temptation, ask God, Lord Jesus,

0:01:04.340,0:01:13.580
give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith under the pressure of temptation of my situation.

0:01:13.580,0:01:15.940
What is your situation?

0:01:15.940,0:01:22.100
When the situation comes, we seem to forget that we are Christians.

The Simple SECRET To Defeat The DEVIL!!!

0:01:48.040,0:01:50.320
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:01:50.320,0:01:51.200
[Amen.]

0:01:51.200,0:02:08.820
You seem to forget, when you are facing a challenge, a situation, that you are what God says you are;

0:02:08.820,0:02:13.040
you can do what God says you can do.

0:02:13.040,0:02:18.480
You seem to forget that you have what God says you have.

0:02:18.480,0:02:23.400
When God is with you, all things are possible.

0:02:23.400,0:02:32.460
You seem to forget that when you are facing a situation.

0:02:32.460,0:02:35.440
You and God together.

0:02:35.440,0:02:43.260
You seem to forget that you and God can move mountains when you are facing difficulties.

0:02:43.260,0:02:45.720
You have to come together; you and who?

0:02:45.720,0:02:47.360
[God.]

0:02:47.360,0:02:51.660
You and God must come together, join hands together.

0:02:51.660,0:02:57.780
There is no mountain, and there shall be no mountain.

0:02:57.780,0:03:04.900
You and God - but you seem to forget this when you are facing what?

0:03:04.900,0:03:06.680
Difficulty.

0:03:06.680,0:03:16.800
You need to remember the more difficult and trying times you have been facing in the past.

0:03:16.800,0:03:25.260
The key to succeeding in life, if you are a child of God - any time there is a difficulty.

0:03:25.260,0:03:33.720
quickly remember the more trying and difficult times you faced in the past.

0:03:33.720,0:03:48.380
This will impart strength to face the present difficulty you are having.

0:03:48.380,0:03:50.680
Just take your time to remember.

0:03:50.680,0:03:54.700
This is what happened to David.

0:03:54.700,0:03:59.500
David walked majestically to the king and said,

0:03:59.500,0:04:06.640
'King, I am going to face this Goliath that has disturbed my brothers and country'.

0:04:06.640,0:04:09.440
The king looked at him: 'Who are you?'

0:04:09.440,0:04:16.920
He said, 'I used my bare hands to kill the bear'.

0:04:16.920,0:04:30.640
When this man came to disturb their country, he quickly remembered the difficult and trial times he overcame.

0:04:30.640,0:04:38.780
Having remembered the bear, he looked at Goliath and said, "Let me face this man".

0:04:38.780,0:04:45.340
In the same vein, that is the key for you to defeat your present situation.

0:04:45.340,0:04:51.620
Tell your neighbour, "This is the key to defeat my present situation".

0:04:51.620,0:04:56.440
You can use the same key to open and lock.

0:04:56.440,0:05:03.260
Remember as David remembered, and he walked majestically to the king.

0:05:03.260,0:05:07.680
Take your time.

0:05:07.680,0:05:18.460
Any time you are facing a challenge or situation, remember the more difficult and trying times

0:05:18.460,0:05:24.240
you had in the past and you overcame.

0:05:24.240,0:05:34.700
That will impart strength to face your present situation.

0:05:34.700,0:05:42.220
I don’t know what I can face now that could be greater than the one I have faced in the past.

0:05:42.220,0:05:43.080
Can you see?

0:05:43.080,0:05:45.900
In the same vein, I don’t know what you can face now

0:05:45.900,0:05:49.900
that can be greater than the one you have passed through in the past.

0:05:49.900,0:05:57.140
Once you remember this, that would impart strength to face your present situation.

0:05:57.140,0:06:05.340
You remember - half of us here came from village, if not 90% of people here.

0:06:05.340,0:06:10.840
You should remember those days when you were drinking dirty water.

0:06:10.840,0:06:17.420
But today you drink pure water, and yet - yellow fever.

0:06:17.420,0:06:22.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:22.140,0:06:26.140
Now you drink pure water.

0:06:26.140,0:06:30.200
Where does the fever come from?

0:06:30.200,0:06:33.340
Tell me.

0:06:33.340,0:06:36.920
You, you are from the village.

0:06:36.920,0:06:46.060
Remember - in those days, when you cooked soup, it stayed for ten days and you kept warming it.

0:06:46.060,0:06:50.720
The more you warmed it, the more it became sweet.

0:06:50.720,0:06:57.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:57.340,0:07:00.140
Can you warm the soup today?

0:07:00.140,0:07:03.660
When you cook a soup today, can you warm it tomorrow and eat it?

0:07:03.660,0:07:04.920
[No]

0:07:04.920,0:07:07.380
But in the village...

0:07:07.380,0:07:12.340
These are the things that brought you up.

0:07:12.340,0:07:15.160
Remember how you were born.

0:07:15.160,0:07:21.380
Many of you were not born in the hospital.

0:07:21.380,0:07:27.840
The people you call your enemies now, they were the ones feeding you when you were a baby.

0:07:27.840,0:07:36.900
Your mummy alone could not have taken care of you - you would be left to move and roam around them,

0:07:36.900,0:07:43.480
but today you see them as somebody who can kill you.

0:07:43.480,0:07:46.840
This is a key I am giving you today.

0:07:46.840,0:07:58.640
Any time you are facing a difficult challenge, remember the more difficult and trying times you had in the past.

0:07:58.640,0:08:00.860
This will impart what?

0:08:00.860,0:08:02.760
[Strength]

0:08:02.760,0:08:05.120
To what?

0:08:05.120,0:08:07.020
To face what?

0:08:07.020,0:08:09.440
To face your present situation.

0:08:09.440,0:08:11.820
You need strength.

0:08:11.820,0:08:17.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:17.320,0:08:19.740
Are you talking of your career?

0:08:19.740,0:08:23.680
Remember the kind of school you attended in the village.

0:08:23.680,0:08:26.160
A school without a roof.

0:08:26.160,0:08:27.520
A school without what?

0:08:27.520,0:08:29.080
[Roof.]

0:08:29.080,0:08:38.120
You studied there under the rain, under the sun - but look today at what you have become.

0:08:38.120,0:08:43.980
If you don't know the kind of school you attended in the village in those days, go back to the village

0:08:43.980,0:08:49.500
and see where those children are studying now.

0:08:49.500,0:08:52.140
These are the things you put together.

0:08:52.140,0:08:56.640
When you think about all this, you will know that no one can stop you.

0:08:56.640,0:09:03.240
Say, "Only me can stop myself; no one can stop me".

0:09:03.240,0:09:07.440
No one can stop you; you can only stop yourself.

0:09:07.440,0:09:14.420
If you could not be stopped then, now, no one can stop you.

0:09:14.420,0:09:19.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:19.500,0:09:25.980
You need strength to further on.

0:09:25.980,0:09:30.740
This is how I nurture myself.

0:09:30.740,0:09:37.880
No matter what comes to me, now when I just remember and sit down and look at my antecedents -

0:09:37.880,0:09:44.340
where I'm coming from and what I have gone through.

0:09:44.340,0:09:51.960
Whatever happens now, I smile and say, "You are a baby".

0:09:51.960,0:09:55.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:55.440,0:09:57.600
I smile.

0:09:57.600,0:10:07.740
Once you don’t trade your joy with your situation, you overcome.

0:10:07.740,0:10:14.020
Tell your neighbour, "Stop trading your joy with your situation"

0:10:14.020,0:10:19.440
Once you stop trading your joy with your situation, you will always overcome

0:10:19.440,0:10:24.480
because you need joy to overcome a situation.

0:10:24.480,0:10:30.700
No matter how big the situation, if you don’t trade your joy with that situation, you overcome it.

0:10:30.700,0:10:34.740
But once joy is gone, you cannot overcome the situation.

0:10:34.740,0:10:37.540
This is what situation wants to take away from you.

0:10:37.540,0:10:39.940
It wants to take away your joy.

0:10:39.940,0:10:41.200
My God.

0:10:41.200,0:10:44.100
It wants to see you sad.

0:10:44.100,0:10:45.900
Situation wants to see you what?

0:10:45.900,0:10:46.600
[Sad.]

0:10:46.600,0:10:49.940
It wants to see you sad.

0:10:49.940,0:10:53.280
Once the situation comes, and you are sad...

0:10:53.280,0:10:55.300
How will I go over this?

0:10:55.300,0:10:56.760
Oh my God.

0:10:56.760,0:10:59.060
This is too much for me.

0:10:59.060,0:11:02.320
Under that situation, you cannot pray.

0:11:02.320,0:11:05.500
Under that situation, you cannot think of God.

0:11:05.500,0:11:11.220
Under that situation...

0:11:11.220,0:11:21.200
Immediately you will lose a sense of reasoning, anybody around you is your enemy.

0:11:21.200,0:11:24.440
You will not be able to give your best.

0:11:24.440,0:11:33.360
I pick the phone call: - Hello
- Your house is on fire

0:11:33.360,0:11:39.440
- You mean my house?
- Yes. It is serious. Fire fighters are there.

0:11:39.440,0:11:42.600
Before that I was smiling.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:49.620,0:11:53.480

I am coming.

0:11:54.780,0:11:58.840
I have traded my what?

0:11:58.840,0:11:59.940
[Joy.]

0:11:59.940,0:12:01.100
With what?

Satan knows what he can do to stop that happiness.

0:12:13.320,0:12:15.700
He knows.

0:12:15.700,0:12:20.280
Somebody wants to see you while you are dancing.

0:12:20.280,0:12:22.080
Where?

0:12:22.080,0:12:25.260

Somebody is fighting you.

0:12:36.500,0:12:43.040
You relax instead of fighting back - you just make it cheap.

0:12:43.040,0:12:47.520
Somebody wants to see you while you are dancing.

0:12:47.520,0:12:50.700
Where?

0:12:50.700,0:12:53.200
OK. I'm coming.

0:12:53.200,0:12:56.440
You want to finish your dancing.

0:12:56.440,0:12:58.820
How many of you can do that?

0:12:58.820,0:13:03.680
Have you ever finished dancing before attending to somebody who wanted to see you?

0:13:03.680,0:13:06.880
No, I know you.

0:13:06.880,0:13:14.360
So please, stop trading your joy with your situation.

0:13:14.360,0:13:21.740
If you have a serious pain in your arm, you can choose not to trade that pain with your joy.

0:13:21.740,0:13:24.180
In serious pain.

0:13:24.180,0:13:25.440
How are you?

0:13:25.440,0:13:26.540
Fine.

0:13:26.540,0:13:28.340
The pain is there.

0:13:28.340,0:13:29.780
Fine.

0:13:29.780,0:13:32.080
I have not been seeing you.

0:13:32.080,0:13:33.520
I was not around.

0:13:33.520,0:13:35.240
OK.

0:13:35.240,0:13:37.340
The pain is still inside me.

0:13:37.340,0:13:41.040
The pain does not want to hear joy.

0:13:41.040,0:13:54.620
Where there is pain and joy is there, the pain will not last.

0:13:54.620,0:14:01.760
Where there is sorrow and joy is there, the sorrow will not last at all.

0:14:01.760,0:14:04.220
They don't see each other.

0:14:04.220,0:14:07.680
It is like a cat and a rat.

When you are sick, if you can choose to be happy in your heart - that sickness will not last long.

0:14:29.980,0:14:36.480
When your marriage is under threat, and somebody is trying to turn it upside down -

0:14:36.480,0:14:40.480
choose to be happy, and see what would happen next.

0:14:40.480,0:14:47.020
Do you know it is the situation that meets joy; it's not joy that meets situation.

0:14:47.020,0:14:54.740
Tell your neighbour, "Situation meets joy; joy never meets situation".

0:14:54.740,0:14:59.420
If you study your life, it is situation that meets joy.

0:14:59.420,0:15:04.840
In one's life, situation comes to joy.

0:15:04.840,0:15:10.760
It is joy that owns you; situation never owns you.

0:15:10.760,0:15:12.980
Situation meets joy.

When the snake is coming to your house, you close the door.

Stop trading your joy with what?

0:15:24.220,0:15:25.880
[Your situation.]

0:15:25.880,0:15:39.140
If you can do this, situation will come but it will not last and you will learn a mighty lesson that will help you.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:44.120,0:15:48.260
Look at my antecedents from the beginning.

0:15:48.260,0:15:52.340
The name of this ministry was not supposed to be "Church Of All Nations".

0:15:52.340,0:16:02.500
When the church had only 8 members, the Lord said this is the "Church Of All Nations".

0:16:02.500,0:16:13.760
How many ministries do you know in your country that bear "Of All Nations"?

0:16:13.760,0:16:19.740
If it were not a ministry with a vision and mission...

0:16:19.740,0:16:22.280
The first church was destroyed, second was destroyed.

0:16:22.280,0:16:27.600
How many of you are still in the business you started with?

0:16:27.600,0:16:33.540
I don't think anybody here still remains in the business he began with, right from the beginning of his life.

0:16:33.540,0:16:35.960
After so many challenges...

0:16:35.960,0:16:40.040
If you don't know where you are going, you cannot continue.

0:16:40.040,0:16:44.620
You will not be able to wait for God's release if you don't know where you are going.

0:16:44.620,0:16:48.600
It is when you know where you are going, you will wait for God's release.

0:16:48.600,0:16:55.080
Tell your neighbour, "When you know where you are going, you will wait for God's release;

0:16:55.080,0:16:58.560
you will wait patiently for God's release".

0:16:58.560,0:17:11.180
But when you don't know where you are going, you will release yourself.

0:17:11.180,0:17:13.720
You have been releasing yourself.

0:17:13.720,0:17:21.240
You release yourself in business, in marriage, in churches, everywhere you just...

0:17:21.240,0:17:22.700
This embarrassment...

0:17:22.700,0:17:24.440
How can you be lying against me?

0:17:24.440,0:17:25.680
You walk away.

0:17:25.680,0:17:32.560
You walk out of the community, business, church or marriage.

0:17:32.560,0:17:34.220
What kind of an insult is this?

0:17:34.220,0:17:37.120
This is an embarrassment, I can't believe what you are saying.

0:17:37.120,0:17:40.720
How can this pastor lie against me?

0:17:40.720,0:17:44.840
You walk out of the church.

0:17:44.840,0:17:49.320
In the marriage too - my husband is lying against me!

0:17:49.320,0:17:51.260
How can my wife do this to me?

0:17:51.260,0:17:54.600
You walk out of the marriage.

0:17:54.600,0:17:56.780
Business - oh my God.

0:17:56.780,0:17:58.480
I am supposed to be promoted.

0:17:58.480,0:18:01.160
Look at my junior - I trained this man.

0:18:01.160,0:18:04.220
Look at him - he has been promoted to the position above me.

0:18:04.220,0:18:07.400
You walk out of the business.

0:18:07.400,0:18:09.640
This is the life you have been living.

0:18:09.640,0:18:11.560
Situation has been releasing you.

0:18:11.560,0:18:13.800
Challenges have been releasing you.

0:18:13.800,0:18:17.520
You heard what Joseph said when he was in the pit.

0:18:17.520,0:18:20.600
He said, "I know where I belong".

0:18:20.600,0:18:22.720
You don't know where you are going.

0:18:22.720,0:18:28.660
He was in the pit where there was no water, no air.

0:18:28.660,0:18:34.940
There he said, "I know where I belong. This is not where I belong".

0:18:34.940,0:18:38.280
You may be seated, thank you.

When you are laughing, satan is crying.

0:18:44.200,0:18:47.220
When you are crying, satan is laughing.

0:18:47.220,0:18:49.140
Are you with me?

0:18:49.140,0:18:51.700
When you are laughing, satan is what?

0:18:51.700,0:18:52.860
[Crying.]

0:18:52.860,0:18:55.240

0:18:55.240,0:18:56.280
[Laughing.]

0:18:59.260,0:19:00.460
[Situation.]

0:19:00.460,0:19:02.520
Situation.

0:19:02.520,0:19:05.640
No matter what happens, hold your joy.

0:19:05.640,0:19:09.380
It is by joy you can overcome your situation.

0:19:09.380,0:19:13.700
If you lose your joy, situation will overwhelm you.

0:19:13.700,0:19:15.460
Situation doesn't want to see joy.

0:19:15.460,0:19:19.300
When situation sees joy, it ceases.

0:19:19.300,0:19:22.560
When situation sees joy, it what?

0:19:22.560,0:19:24.160
