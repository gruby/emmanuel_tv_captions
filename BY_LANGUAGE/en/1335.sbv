0:00:00.000,0:00:05.040
Look, there's a symptom that is coming out like a water in your stomach.

0:00:05.040,0:00:10.540
Yes, faeces and water. It is getting to two years now - 22 months.

0:00:10.540,0:00:12.440
Since after the surgery, I did...

0:00:12.440,0:00:17.380
Don't worry. That is what I am seeing - the symptoms coming out of your stomach -

0:00:17.380,0:00:21.680
both the water and the...

0:00:21.680,0:00:22.840
Father! Thank You, Jesus!

0:00:22.840,0:00:24.600
What do you think is the cause?

0:00:24.600,0:00:30.340
I did an intestinal surgery in February, 2015.

0:00:30.340,0:00:32.980
They said some parts of my intestine were rotten.

0:00:32.980,0:00:35.880
So, they had to cut off some parts of the intestine.

0:00:35.880,0:00:38.820
Then, after stitching it, the thing burst.

0:00:38.820,0:00:40.820
A wrong operation.

0:00:40.820,0:00:43.240
Yes, it then resulted to a fistula.

0:00:43.240,0:00:47.640
I said there is a wrong operation. After praying for you, go back.

0:00:47.640,0:00:50.280
I will tell you to go back to the doctor; they will cover it back.

0:00:50.280,0:00:57.060
If they cover the face now, there is a wrong thing they have cut in your stomach.

0:00:57.060,0:01:00.240
And you carry pads anywhere you go.

0:01:00.240,0:01:02.240
Thank You, Jesus!

So we would like to hear your wonderful testimony to the glory of God

0:02:28.840,0:02:35.600
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of enterocutanea fistula

0:02:35.600,0:02:41.320
as a result of a surgery I went through in February 2015

0:02:41.320,0:02:47.180
whereby the doctors did a procedure called exploratory laparotomy of the right hemicolectomy.

0:02:47.180,0:02:53.760
The problem started just a day like that. I woke up. I was having pain in my abdominal wall.

0:02:53.760,0:02:57.000
I went to the hospital. They sent me for a scan.

0:02:57.000,0:03:00.800
After the scan, when the result came, they said, "Immediate surgery".

0:03:00.800,0:03:07.620
So I went to the first hospital. They rejected me. They were afraid that I was not going to make it.

0:03:07.620,0:03:09.920
They took me to another hospital.

0:03:09.920,0:03:14.220
I was even wheeled to the hospital because I was only - I was not stable.

0:03:14.220,0:03:20.280
I was really bad so the doctors now took me to the theatre.

0:03:20.280,0:03:26.460
When they opened me up, they saw that almost all the intestine was ruptured.

0:03:26.460,0:03:33.620
So one of the doctors, the surgeon said, "We are going to close her up; she cannot make it".

0:03:33.620,0:03:37.720
One of them said, "No! Let's try".

0:03:37.720,0:03:42.600
I heard them calling me,  "Madam, do you believe in the power of God?"

0:03:42.600,0:03:44.980
I said, "Yes, I do".

0:03:44.980,0:03:49.520
So they said, "Okay, they are proceeding" They proceeded and did the surgery.

0:03:49.520,0:03:56.520
And after that they removed most of my intestine; it was cut off.

0:03:56.520,0:04:02.560
And they sutured it. So after this suturing, I think most of it busted.

0:04:02.560,0:04:08.300
A complication like that then resulted in the enterocutanea fistula

0:04:08.300,0:04:14.880
whereby there's a leakage of faecal matter from my intestine to the abdominal wall,

0:04:14.880,0:04:19.800
which means that I cannot really do so many things because of it.

0:04:19.800,0:04:25.940
I always pad my stomach all the time. I cannot walk very well.

0:04:25.940,0:04:30.280
I cannot stand up to drink water. I cannot sit down to eat.

0:04:30.280,0:04:33.980
I can only lie down to eat or lie down to drink water.

0:04:33.980,0:04:39.920
Each time, I would always put my hand in my stomach to remove all the faecal things

0:04:39.920,0:04:44.300
because as at that time, I was not able to pass stool.

0:04:44.300,0:04:48.540
Okay, you mean to say, madam, that the faeces would come out through your stomach?

0:04:48.540,0:04:51.000
Yes, all the things I ate, the faeces,

0:04:51.000,0:04:56.560
the faecal matter was coming out from my intestine to my abdominal wall.

0:04:56.560,0:05:01.400
I was always removing it three to four times a day. Then we would put plaster on it again.

0:05:01.400,0:05:06.620
Anything I ate, I would feel the movement and it made me very uncomfortable.

0:05:06.620,0:05:10.540
I was not able to do many things, even on the bed.

0:05:10.540,0:05:14.300
I couldn't go anywhere - my business,  everything was closed down.

0:05:14.300,0:05:19.360
And the pain that goes with it, is like.. inexplicable.

0:05:19.360,0:05:23.900
Okay, so just to be very clear, madam, the pictures we are seeing here show

0:05:23.900,0:05:27.620
how these faeces would come from your stomach region

0:05:27.620,0:05:32.520
as opposed to coming through the normal passage after the complications of this surgery.

0:05:32.520,0:05:37.700
Yes, the faeces was now coming out from my stomach - the water, everything.

0:05:37.700,0:05:43.700
What was supposed to go as waste through the rectum was all coming out from my stomach.

0:05:43.700,0:05:48.880
And you said during this period, you could not eat normally, you would have to lie down,

0:05:48.880,0:05:54.860
even just to take a small drop of wáter and you were even unable to take a bath, is that right?

0:05:54.860,0:05:58.300
Yes, during this period I didn't really eat.

0:05:58.300,0:06:02.800
I ate once in a while. Even that still leaked. I took little water.

0:06:02.800,0:06:07.600
And before I took them, I didn't like sitting while eating. If I wanted to put something in my mouth,

0:06:07.600,0:06:10.300
I would have to go to my bed and lie on my back.

0:06:10.300,0:06:14.280
I couldn't even lie on my side or on my tummy.

0:06:14.280,0:06:18.240
I would only lie on my back. I would just lie down like that and drink wáter.

0:06:18.240,0:06:24.220
All through this period, I never had my bath for one day - normal bathing like a human being.

0:06:24.220,0:06:29.760
It was only cleaning. I would just clean up, day by day, from morning till night,

0:06:29.760,0:06:35.840
365 days times three. So I never had a normal bath.

0:06:35.840,0:06:41.560
So people of God, we can understand the severity of the condition that our mother was in.

0:06:41.560,0:06:46.500
She just recounted now how for three whole years, she was facing this situation

0:06:46.500,0:06:51.040
after the problem with the surgery. The faeces would pass through her stomach.

0:06:51.040,0:06:53.780
She couldn't take a bath. She couldn't eat normally.

0:06:53.780,0:06:59.000
She had to lie down, just to take a little bit of wáter and as she ate, she would feel the food

0:06:59.000,0:07:04.620
pass through her stomach until it formed faeces and then she had to take it out through her stomach.

0:07:04.620,0:07:11.020
This was the critical condition that she was in as a result of that complication in surgery.

0:07:11.020,0:07:15.680
Madam, after this surgery, medically, what did the doctors advise you about

0:07:15.680,0:07:18.640
how they could try and resolve this issue?

0:07:18.640,0:07:25.160
When I went from one hospital to the other, seeking second opinions from different medical practitioners,

0:07:25.160,0:07:29.560
what they told me was that, "Madam, you should be happy and thank your God

0:07:29.560,0:07:35.920
that you survived this initial surgery. Don't ever attempt going for any medical procedure again

0:07:35.920,0:07:40.520
because it will be worse or you may not even make it".

0:07:40.520,0:07:46.140
So you were facing the prospect of living like this for the rest of your life as a result..

0:07:46.140,0:07:50.840
Now tell us - in the midst of this, where else did you go in search of a solution

0:07:50.840,0:07:53.280
when this situation was so critical?

0:07:53.280,0:08:00.220
When this situation persisted because they had also told me that the intestine -

0:08:00.220,0:08:03.540
the way it was - a lot of it had been cut.

0:08:03.540,0:08:08.180
I could not be able to lift so many things like lifting weights.

0:08:08.180,0:08:13.120
So from there, I was now going from one hospital to the other again going to churches.

0:08:13.120,0:08:18.160
Then one of the doctors told me that I should allow nature to take its course,

0:08:18.160,0:08:20.120
"Let the healing be a natural thing".

0:08:20.120,0:08:23.360
That I shouldn't go to do anything because of the danger of it.

0:08:23.360,0:08:26.280
So from there, I proceeded to so many churches.

0:08:26.280,0:08:29.220
Like I went to Abuja to one church.

0:08:29.220,0:08:32.460
When I went there, I had to pay money to see the man of God.

0:08:32.460,0:08:38.740
So when I got into his office, they were telling me that they had to calculate how old I was

0:08:38.740,0:08:47.880
so that the money - that's how they would know the exact amount I was going to pay.

0:08:47.880,0:08:56.080
I was also to pay their transport money from Abuja to Lagos, for the healing and deliverance, everything.

0:08:56.080,0:09:02.600
When they had calculated everything, the money was so much. So I said, "No".

0:09:02.600,0:09:08.900
When I was in the office, I saw the photograph of Prophet T.B. Joshua pasted in the office.

0:09:08.900,0:09:15.200
I said to myself, "Wow, this is our dear great prophet, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:09:15.200,0:09:19.660
So if his prophet is there, if his photograph is there, what am I doing?

0:09:19.660,0:09:24.880
And I know that at The SCOAN, no money is being paid

0:09:24.880,0:09:30.080
for any healing services rendered to human beings".

0:09:30.080,0:09:36.980
Kate Chimezie & Family
Healing Testimony

0:09:36.980,0:09:46.320
It was on these notes that I came back to Lagos and came to The SCOAN.

0:09:46.320,0:09:50.160
Okay, now we watched on the clip how this Word of prophecy came about.

0:09:50.160,0:09:52.520
Can you just recount to us that day.

0:09:52.520,0:09:55.860
What happened when you received that Word of prophecy?

0:09:55.860,0:10:00.420
When I came that day, I was privileged to meet with the man of God.

0:10:00.420,0:10:03.420
He came close to me and touched me.

0:10:03.420,0:10:09.640
He now prophesied and said, "There are symptoms coming out from your stomach".

0:10:09.640,0:10:12.400
He asked me, "What was the cause?" I said, "I don't know".

0:10:12.400,0:10:14.920
He said, "Wrong surgery". He asked me, "What surgery?"

0:10:14.920,0:10:18.800
I was trying to tell him. He said, "No, wrong surgery. Don't worry.

0:10:18.800,0:10:26.780
I'm going to pray for you and after the prayer, you go back and they will correct the mistake".

0:10:26.780,0:10:31.600
Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:31.600,0:10:36.640
So tell us, after receiving this word of prophecy, what happened next?

0:10:36.640,0:10:41.800
When I received this prophecy - because initially, I had refused to go for any other surgery

0:10:41.800,0:10:45.740
because people were suggesting that I should go for surgery, go for other medical things.

0:10:45.740,0:10:52.120
I said, "No. I'm not ready" because previously, I've had other surgeries - like four surgeries in my life.

0:10:52.120,0:10:56.820
So I didn't really - in fact, I was very bad, even my photos show that I was not stable

0:10:56.820,0:11:01.560
to withstand another surgery.  So I didn´t want to go for any surgery.

0:11:01.560,0:11:06.140
But when I got here and the man of God now prophesied to me that after the prayer,

0:11:06.140,0:11:12.720
I was to go back to these medical practioners, for them to do "a correction".

0:11:12.720,0:11:15.260
He said, "A correction".

0:11:15.260,0:11:19.200
That was now what made me go back to the hospital.

0:11:19.200,0:11:24.660
When I got back to the hospital, the doctors told me on the day of the surgery

0:11:24.660,0:11:28.780
that they were going to do a colostomy for me.

0:11:28.780,0:11:33.560
I said, "Wow! Which one is colostomy again?" That they were going to put a colostomy bag for me.

0:11:33.560,0:11:39.260
A colostomy bag is something - it is a bag connected to the intestinal walls;

0:11:39.260,0:11:45.780
from the intestine to the outside abdominal wall, wherein all the faecal matter like faeces and water

0:11:45.780,0:11:52.500
would be stored on a daily basis and you would be emptying it like every four to five hours.

0:11:52.500,0:11:57.840
After like three to six months, I would go back, and they would remove the colostomy bag

0:11:57.840,0:12:00.840
and then restore everything.

0:12:00.840,0:12:05.280
I said, "No. That wasn't what my prophet said.

0:12:05.280,0:12:10.920
My prophet said that I was going for "a correction".

0:12:10.920,0:12:12.940
He said, "Ah!" The other asked, "Who are you?"

0:12:12.940,0:12:15.600
He asked, "Are you Emmanuel?" I said, "Yes".

0:12:15.600,0:12:20.080
He asked, "From where?". I said, "Synagogue Church Of All Nations. Prophet T.B. Joshua".

0:12:20.080,0:12:24.140
He said, "Oh, I know that radical prophet".

0:12:24.140,0:12:26.400
So that was the reaction of the doctor?

0:12:26.400,0:12:28.280
Yes, that was what they said.

0:12:28.280,0:12:30.760
So they said, "Ok".

0:12:30.760,0:12:35.320
They told us all the things we were going to get for the surgery. We bought so many things.

0:12:35.320,0:12:40.140
When I entered inside the theater, my children were outside

0:12:40.140,0:12:42.980
because that time I didn't know what was happening again.

0:12:42.980,0:12:47.140
They were always going outside to meet my children to go and buy this and that.

0:12:47.140,0:12:48.880
They were always buying, buying, buying.

0:12:48.880,0:12:52.920
When they had bought it, they would return it back and tell them, "We don't need it, we didn't use it.

0:12:52.920,0:12:57.600
Go and buy this one". They kept on buying and returning. My children were like, "Oh, what is happening?

0:12:57.600,0:12:59.500
For over six hours, she has been there.

0:12:59.500,0:13:05.300
Nobody is telling us anything - only buy and return. So what´s happening?"

0:13:05.300,0:13:11.660
That was how after like six hours, they woke me up and said, "Madam, we are taking you to your room".

0:13:11.660,0:13:15.880
I said, "Thank You, Jesus!" They then took me to my room.

0:13:15.880,0:13:20.160
On the following day, I was standing on my feet. I was walking.

0:13:20.160,0:13:27.280
Every tube that they had put on me - both in the mouth and nose, everything -

0:13:27.280,0:13:29.660
the following day, they removed everything.

0:13:29.660,0:13:41.020
On the third, fourth day, I was discharged from the hospital.

0:13:41.020,0:13:45.120
And here I am now. I am healed, I am fine, I am good.

0:13:45.120,0:13:58.420
I came here with my family to return honour and glory to whom honour is due, in the mighty name of Jesus.

0:13:58.420,0:14:06.600
I also thank our dear Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has allowed God to use him to do

0:14:06.600,0:14:11.400
and also thank our mummy in the Lord, Evangelist Evelyn Joshua,

0:14:11.400,0:14:14.780
for her support all through this period and all the evangelists.

0:14:14.780,0:14:20.440
Now I can go to the toilet normally. I can walk around. I can move around.

0:14:20.440,0:14:22.780
I can lie anyhow. I can do anything.

0:14:22.780,0:14:28.220
Initially, I couldn't do anything. Anywhere I went, I had to pad myself.

0:14:28.220,0:14:32.680
I had to use cloth and tie myself with a belt. I couldn't move.

0:14:32.680,0:14:35.220
I could not do anything. I was not able to do anything.

0:14:35.220,0:14:38.160
Oh, my goodness! It is so much.

0:14:38.160,0:14:47.840
When during the first service this year January 2018, the man of God was declaring a new beginning,

0:14:47.840,0:14:53.040
I was saying, "New beginning? Look at how I am! How am I going to start a new beginning?"

0:14:53.040,0:14:57.760
I never knew it was coming so easily like that, so soon.

0:14:57.760,0:15:04.160
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:04.160,0:15:08.760
Indeed, we can all see that our mother is fully, completely restored,

0:15:08.760,0:15:13.280
and we give all the glory to God Almighty for that prophetic word that gave her the assurance

0:15:13.300,0:15:18.360
that God Almighty would actually use the medical doctors to correct the wrong surgery

0:15:18.360,0:15:21.240
and restore her to the position to which God created her.

0:15:21.240,0:15:24.900
We give all the glory to God and madam, we can see a couple of pictures on the board,

0:15:24.900,0:15:26.200
apart from the ones we saw earlier.

0:15:26.200,0:15:30.240
Could you just describe to us what we are seeing on each of these pictures?

0:15:30.240,0:15:33.060
Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:15:33.060,0:15:39.060
Hey, these pictures here. Initially - that was then, not now.

0:15:39.060,0:15:40.460
Horrible!

0:15:40.460,0:15:45.720
This was my photo - what I was going through in my life during that period.

0:15:45.720,0:15:51.340
In those three years - 365 days times three.

0:15:51.340,0:15:56.940
So this was me. This was how the faecal matter was always coming out from my intestine.

0:15:56.940,0:16:03.260
I didn´t even eat anything, except bread, something that was hard so it could come out.

0:16:03.260,0:16:05.840
If not, it would just flow out.

0:16:05.840,0:16:08.760
Look at it here.

0:16:08.760,0:16:13.420
Look at how it was. This surface was always bloody 24/7.

0:16:13.420,0:16:18.220
Each time I opened it up, it was like they had just performed the surgery that same day.

0:16:18.220,0:16:19.520
Look at it here.

0:16:19.520,0:16:24.940
Each time, every like three to four hours, it was soaked already. It was leaking everywhere, is padded.

0:16:24.940,0:16:31.660
I always used cotton wool, gauze, antiseptic, cream.

0:16:31.660,0:16:33.380
I would then plaster it.

0:16:33.380,0:16:36.600
This was how I tied myself, even more than this.

0:16:36.600,0:16:41.060
Before, I couldn't move because the whole thing was always motion on the surface

0:16:41.060,0:16:43.140
and it was always very, very painful.

0:16:43.140,0:16:49.720
Here are just a few of all the things I used to use for dressing, my drugs.

0:16:49.720,0:17:00.100
This roller plaster, it lasted for like two days. This is just the 5 x 10 cm plaster that I used.

0:17:00.100,0:17:05.740
There are always 5 in this pack, and it  lasted for 2 days. This cotton wool lasted for like three to four days.

0:17:05.740,0:17:09.120
Then the creams and all other drugs.

0:17:09.120,0:17:15.320
Besides, when I came to The SCOAN, I was addicted to this drug called Tramadol.

0:17:15.320,0:17:17.720
Everybody knows what Tramadol is.

0:17:17.720,0:17:23.760
I had been on that drug for almost seven years before I came

0:17:23.760,0:17:30.960
because I had had an injury on my leg, a broken ankle that I sustained through domestic violence.

0:17:30.960,0:17:35.320
So since then, I had been addicted to that drug because I was unable to do anything.

0:17:35.320,0:17:37.910
I couldn't stop that drug. I couldn't move.

0:17:37.910,0:17:40.120
I couldn't move my leg and everything.

0:17:40.120,0:17:44.520
But on one of the days, when dear prophet was ministering deliverance,

0:17:44.520,0:17:46.340
he just tapped my face.

0:17:46.340,0:17:50.240
He tapped me on the forehead and went because that time he was always preaching,

0:17:50.240,0:17:54.340
"That if you forget your drug, know that God has done it".

0:17:54.340,0:17:58.800
Each time I prayed, I would ask God, "Please make me forget my drugs".

0:17:58.800,0:18:04.540
And that day, lo and behold, after the tap, I went home. In the night, I didn´t feel pain.

0:18:04.540,0:18:08.280
In the morning when I woke up, I didn´t feel pain, I didn´t remember the Tramadol.

0:18:08.280,0:18:12.640
I didn´t take Tramadol and that was how the Tramadol episode left. It has been over for a year now.

0:18:12.640,0:18:14.780
Now there's no more Tramadol. Thank you.

0:18:14.780,0:18:17.380
Wow, let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:18:17.380,0:18:22.120
Now we would like to hear a quick word from your children. If we could hear from our brother here.

0:18:22.120,0:18:27.140
Just a quick word, what he can say as a son to see his mother restored

0:18:27.140,0:18:29.780
after such a traumatic experience for the family.

0:18:29.780,0:18:33.300
My name is Clifford Chimezie.

0:18:33.300,0:18:41.940
My mom had been sick for three years, over three years. I think since February 2015.

0:18:41.940,0:18:44.800
It had been terrible since then.

0:18:44.800,0:18:56.380
Sometimes when I went out to have fun with my friends, I would remember that my mom was at home.

0:18:56.380,0:19:00.200
So we understand the emotion our brother is conveying.

0:19:00.200,0:19:05.680
If you put yourself in his position to see your own mother going through such suffering,

0:19:05.680,0:19:08.860
I'm very sure you would express similar emotions.

0:19:08.860,0:19:15.320
But we thank God today that that past pain has been replaced by perfect good health,

0:19:15.320,0:19:18.280
and we thank God that today, it's turned into a testimony.

0:19:18.280,0:19:22.580
So we give all the glory to God for what He has done in the life of this family.

0:19:22.580,0:19:26.820
Brother, you were saying how this really affected you as her son.

0:19:26.820,0:19:29.580
Okay.

0:19:29.580,0:19:32.560
I was the only one in the hospital.

0:19:32.560,0:19:57.180
Kate Chimezie & Family
Healing Testimony

0:19:57.180,0:20:01.480
At this point, we can really understand the emotions that are being conveyed by our brother.

0:20:01.480,0:20:04.500
Let's quickly hear from another one of the family members

0:20:04.500,0:20:08.400
as we give our brother a few moments to compose himself.

0:20:08.400,0:20:11.780
We can really feel what he is feeling as someone

0:20:11.780,0:20:16.160
that has seen his own mother nearly at the point of death to where God restored her.

0:20:16.160,0:20:17.600
Our brother, you are welcome.

0:20:17.600,0:20:22.340
Please introduce yourself and tell us what you can say concerning this wonderful testimony.

0:20:22.340,0:20:26.360
Hello everyone. My name is Oluchukwu Chimezie.

0:20:26.360,0:20:33.320
As you have seen my mom was sick for about 3 years.

0:20:33.320,0:20:36.400
It was troubling us for a while,

0:20:36.400,0:20:40.620
even though I wasn´t around when she did the first surgery.

0:20:40.620,0:20:44.220
They didn't tell me most of the things she was passing through.

0:20:44.220,0:20:47.640
They just wanted me to concentrate on my studies.

0:20:47.640,0:20:53.760
It was when I came back ending of 2016, I knew the gravity of what she was facing.

0:20:53.760,0:20:59.060
I tried to convince her to go for another surgery.

0:20:59.060,0:21:03.920
She refused. She was like, the doctors advised her against it.

0:21:03.920,0:21:08.720
If she did it, she was going to die.

0:21:08.720,0:21:13.920
Every time we went to the hospital, they kept on saying - they kept on giving excuses

0:21:13.920,0:21:22.520
that the reason why it had not healed was because of diabetes, high blood pressure, or low sugar.

0:21:22.520,0:21:27.960
They kept on coming up with different things, and we would say, "Okay. Let's change the routine.

0:21:27.960,0:21:31.700
The next six months you are going to eat this.

0:21:31.700,0:21:35.560
The next three months maybe you're going to be on total bed rest".

0:21:35.560,0:21:39.100
We just kept on changing (her routine) and nothing was changing.

0:21:39.100,0:21:45.720
Every time she would still come back. We would still buy plasters in bulk every month.

0:21:45.720,0:21:54.420
It was not like something that anyone should go through, any son should go through.

0:21:54.420,0:22:00.060
These things affected our lives in so many ways, even socially.

0:22:00.060,0:22:04.800
You would go out with your friends and you would think you're having fun.

0:22:04.800,0:22:08.420
Then it would dawn on you that someone was at home that needed help;

0:22:08.420,0:22:10.300
someone was not feeling fine.

0:22:10.300,0:22:14.440
Then, immediately, your mood would swing. You would start feeling bad.

0:22:14.440,0:22:18.820
You would not even concentrate again and you would want to get back home.

0:22:18.820,0:22:24.100
You see, Christmas, New Year celebrations, Easter -

0:22:24.100,0:22:29.020
I mean, those were for normal people, not for us. We didn't celebrate those holidays

0:22:29.020,0:22:33.960
because these people that have the luxury to do that, that have chosen to celebrate it...

0:22:33.960,0:22:38.080
When you see your mom when you get home, and you see her like that,

0:22:38.080,0:22:41.880
you would just feel bad.

0:22:41.880,0:22:47.660
Most of the time I ended up just going out. I would go out and have some drinks with friends,

0:22:47.660,0:22:52.140
just so that I could be calm and forget about what was going on.

0:22:52.140,0:22:55.800
I wouldn't think about it that much.

0:22:55.800,0:23:00.940
As I was saying, it's not something that someone should ever go through.

0:23:00.940,0:23:03.060
Can you just tell us as her son,

0:23:03.060,0:23:06.980
how do you feel now seeing her fully restored?

0:23:06.980,0:23:10.520
When you saw her come out of the operation and to see the changes in her life,

0:23:10.520,0:23:16.320
just tell us the celebration in the family since that wonderful encounter.

0:23:16.320,0:23:22.080
It was overwhelming because during the surgery, we saw them coming out

0:23:22.080,0:23:26.820
with this big bucket filled with blood - transparent buckets like this.

0:23:26.820,0:23:33.280
I mean, it was filled with blood and there was this thing moving around in it, floating.

0:23:33.280,0:23:38.460
I was thinking, "Hey, they put my mum's small intestine in there.

0:23:38.460,0:23:42.820
That she's not going to have any other option than to do the...

0:23:42.820,0:23:46.600
Maybe she would just be like that all her life".

0:23:46.600,0:23:52.580
I was later that everybody was like, "We need to know what they did.

0:23:52.580,0:23:57.620
What exactly did they do?" We found out that, "Hey, it's been closed. Everything is fine".

0:23:57.620,0:24:01.540
We were so happy. We were overwhelmed with joy!

0:24:01.540,0:24:07.520
And this was something that I thought would have a recovery time of like 3 months, 6 months.

0:24:07.529,0:24:13.920
In the next two days, I saw my mum walking around. I was like, "What happened? How come?"

0:24:13.920,0:24:20.080

Healing Testimony

0:24:20.080,0:24:24.040
Few days later, they discharged her.

0:24:24.040,0:24:27.680
I went back. I was like, "Are you people sure? You want this lady to go?"

0:24:27.680,0:24:33.920
They were like, "Yeah, she's fine. You can go. We've done everything".

0:24:33.920,0:24:35.920
I really...

0:24:35.920,0:24:41.640
You don't even understand how joyful I am just now, for what God has done in my life.

0:24:41.640,0:24:43.560
You see people everywhere.

0:24:43.560,0:24:49.700
Maybe you want to be like this person, "This person, I want his life". Or something like that.

0:24:49.700,0:24:54.620
And you don't know that the person might be going through serious depression.

0:24:54.620,0:24:58.860
What I was going through wasn't physical. You would see me. I would be smiling at you.

0:24:58.860,0:25:06.820
But inside, I was going through serious pain every day - every day of my life.

0:25:06.820,0:25:13.100
Basically, you would get people telling you in different ways, "I want to be like you"

0:25:13.100,0:25:16.620
and in my mind I would be like, "You don´t know what I'm passing through"

0:25:16.620,0:25:18.700
but I couldn't really tell them that.

0:25:18.700,0:25:22.600
The celebration has returned to the family and the family can now be happy -

0:25:22.600,0:25:24.320
truly, through this healing.

0:25:24.320,0:25:27.980
I'm really overjoyed. I can't even overemphasize.

0:25:27.980,0:25:34.940
You don't even know what's going through my mind just now.

0:25:34.940,0:25:38.460
Amen! Let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:25:38.460,0:25:42.380
We know there are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:25:42.380,0:25:46.240
And we know that our brother has really expressed that joy on behalf of the family.

0:25:46.240,0:25:48.640
Let's just hear a quick word from our sister as well.

0:25:48.640,0:25:52.200
My name is Chidubem Chimezie.

0:25:52.200,0:25:58.320
The problem that brought my mom to this church was the problem of fistula enterocutanea

0:25:58.320,0:26:04.940
This really affected her a lot and affected me a lot because I would be in school,

0:26:04.940,0:26:09.340
but most times, I would have to come home. It was just hard doing a lot of things

0:26:09.340,0:26:17.720
because she couldn't really do anything herself. So most times, I had to face school, face her.

0:26:17.720,0:26:23.600
Just mostly mental issues.

0:26:23.600,0:26:28.320
It really affected me schoolwise, physically, everything.

0:26:28.340,0:26:33.880
But I just thank God a lot that she's here, and she's healed right now. Thank You, God.

0:26:33.880,0:26:37.820
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:26:37.820,0:26:40.120
We give all the glory to God Almighty.

0:26:40.120,0:26:42.460
We just want to hear a final word from our brother now.

0:26:42.460,0:26:47.580
I just want to thank God because till now, I cannot believe it.

0:26:47.580,0:26:51.940
I still go to her room in the morning to check if it is true.

0:26:51.940,0:26:57.800
During those days, I would dream that I was actually sewing up her stomach.

0:26:57.800,0:27:05.820
These days, I still did not believe it. Even tomorrow, I'm still going to go and check.

0:27:05.820,0:27:09.600
Because I am still in shock. I still cannot believe it yet.

0:27:09.600,0:27:14.940
I'm going to check tomorrow again. I need to be sure.

0:27:14.940,0:27:19.780
Because it was for three years - three very long years.

0:27:19.780,0:27:23.160
A professional doctor said that she was going to die.

0:27:23.160,0:27:27.260
When she went for the first surgery, I was the only one in the hospital.

0:27:27.260,0:27:31.540
How could a doctor come out to tell me that my mother was going to die?

0:27:31.540,0:27:38.740
Why?

0:27:38.740,0:27:42.500
But today she is alive, and fully restored in our midst.

0:27:42.500,0:27:48.280
Yes, she is fully restored. I think she´s getting to seven weeks recovery.

0:27:48.280,0:27:51.800
I don't know how that is possible. It is normally three months.

0:27:51.800,0:27:57.340
But after four weeks, she was fine - completely.

0:27:57.340,0:28:02.360
They discharged her after three days. She was completely fine after four weeks.

0:28:02.360,0:28:05.020
How? I do not know.

0:28:05.020,0:28:10.960
It is God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:28:10.960,0:28:14.140
So finally, brother, let's hear from you on behalf of the family.

0:28:14.140,0:28:18.900
What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world and those present here today?

0:28:18.900,0:28:24.600
Ok. I'm actually not a member.  I came because of the testimony.

0:28:24.600,0:28:27.360
It's a big one.

0:28:27.360,0:28:36.660
She watches Emmanuel TV so I just come across it, I watched it a little bit.

0:28:36.660,0:28:38.920
I saw the prophet talking.

0:28:38.920,0:28:43.900
But I did not like her seeing me when I was watching it so that she didn't push me into it.

0:28:43.900,0:28:48.220
So I usually hid it from her when I was watching Emmanuel TV.

0:28:48.220,0:28:51.400
My advice to everybody here is:

0:28:51.400,0:29:06.780
He is one of the few prophets in the country that actually speaks the good news.

0:29:06.780,0:29:13.640
Listen to him. Do not allow these words to be used against you on Judgment Day.

0:29:13.640,0:29:21.320
Listen to him. Don't just take these words, leave this place and forget about them.

0:29:21.320,0:29:28.360
She's a better person today because she listened to him. Forget about the sickness.

0:29:28.360,0:29:30.960
Please listen to him. I know what I'm saying.

0:29:30.960,0:29:38.840
I know what I heard. Just one minute ago, I know what I received. I know what I got.

0:29:38.840,0:29:42.020
Listen to him. Let it always be in your head.

0:29:42.020,0:29:46.280
Remember it. Let it always be in your mouth that you may speak it to the world.

0:29:46.280,0:29:52.320
Let it always be in your heart that you may attain eternal salvation. Thank you.

0:29:52.320,0:29:56.280
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:29:56.280,0:29:57.980
Thank You, Jesus.

0:29:57.980,0:30:02.300
Finally, we want to hear a final word of advice from you to our viewers,

0:30:02.300,0:30:05.960
with what Jesus has done for you, restoring you completely.

0:30:05.960,0:30:10.520
What is your word of advice and encouragement to our viewers all over the world

0:30:10.520,0:30:13.500
to cap off this wonderful testimony?

0:30:13.500,0:30:16.300
Good Morning, Church.

0:30:16.300,0:30:19.660
I'm still thanking God and thanking the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:30:19.660,0:30:23.540
for all He has done in my life and my family.

0:30:23.540,0:30:28.160
I know this not going to be the end of my testimony.

0:30:28.160,0:30:32.880
So what I'm saying and advising the whole world and viewers, anywhere you are:

0:30:32.880,0:30:36.980
This Word - it is only the Word that can set you free.

0:30:36.980,0:30:41.480
The way he always talks about it, the way he stresses it.

0:30:41.480,0:30:43.580
He says, "Listen to it!"

0:30:43.580,0:30:50.180
It will slowly show you what to do, tell you what to do - at any time in your life, at any crossroad.

0:30:50.180,0:30:53.440
When you are with Him and He is with you, you don't have a problem.

0:30:53.440,0:31:02.360
He said that when Job was there and the permission was granted to the enemy to tempt Job,

0:31:02.360,0:31:07.060
he did so because God was holding Job's hand and at the end what happened?

0:31:07.060,0:31:11.240
Job was successful. He was victorious because God was with him.

0:31:11.240,0:31:15.360
When God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is with you, no matter what situation you find yourself in,

0:31:15.360,0:31:19.540
victory is sure, in Jesus' name.

0:31:19.540,0:31:24.620
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:31:24.620,0:31:28.960
We thank God for this wonderful testimony. We pray that God will give the grace to this family

0:31:28.960,0:31:32.220
to continue to make His Word the standard for their lives

0:31:32.220,0:31:35.600
and we know more wonderful testimonies are coming, in Jesus' name.

0:31:35.600,0:31:40.260
Amen. Thank You, Jesus, I'm healed.
