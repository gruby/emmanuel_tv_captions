A message the Lord said I should give to my African Continent:

0:00:05.680,0:00:09.680
No African country can succeed alone.

0:00:09.680,0:00:18.140
Africans need each other to develop.

0:00:18.140,0:00:19.280
Tell your neighbour.

0:00:19.280,0:00:22.760
[Africans need each other to develop.]

0:00:22.760,0:00:27.880
West Africa needs Southern Africa to develop.

0:00:27.880,0:00:32.460
Southern Africa needs West Africa to develop.

0:00:32.460,0:00:36.760
North Africa needs East Africa to develop

0:00:36.760,0:00:41.980
and East Africa needs North Africa to develop.

0:00:41.980,0:00:47.200
No one is self-sufficient.

0:00:47.200,0:00:51.560
We cannot do without each other.

0:00:51.560,0:01:02.960
Everyone has a contribution.

0:01:02.960,0:01:12.360
Whether you are poor, rich or an immigrant,

0:01:12.360,0:01:28.300
everyone has a contribution for the development of Africa, at the level we are now.

0:01:28.300,0:01:42.180
Dear Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.

0:01:42.180,0:02:01.460
With regard to the issue of illegal immigrants, drugs and other crimes,

0:02:01.460,0:02:07.820
our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.

0:02:07.820,0:02:16.100
That is our duty - to give them useful information about issues like that.

0:02:16.100,0:02:24.120
In our respective countries, our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.

0:02:24.120,0:02:38.560
It is only when they fail to carry out their duty that we citizens can lawfully protest.

0:02:38.560,0:02:44.860
I want to show you a little video before I continue talking.

0:02:44.860,0:02:51.460
There is no country in Africa that is not involved in what you are about to watch.

0:02:51.460,0:02:54.000
What is the cause?

0:02:54.000,0:03:02.800
It's because Africa has neglected her youth

0:03:02.800,0:03:07.180
Africa has neglected her youth.

0:03:07.180,0:03:11.080
The youth - they have neglected them.

0:03:11.080,0:03:17.100
Africa has abandoned the youth to themselves

0:03:17.100,0:03:23.740
whereas tomorrow's Africa is the youth.

0:03:23.740,0:03:31.240
But we have neglected them - that is the cause of all this frustration.

0:03:31.240,0:03:37.060
When I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.

0:03:37.060,0:03:41.260
Please, can you play this cassette for me - please, let's watch.

0:03:41.260,0:03:44.780
In the mediterranean, off the coast of Libya,

0:03:44.780,0:03:51.880
this unstable fishing boat is overloaded with migrants and refugees.

0:03:51.880,0:03:57.240
So there is a horrible inevitability in what is about to happen.

0:03:57.240,0:04:01.420
The boat is starting to tilt.

0:04:01.420,0:04:08.900
Then the situation becomes so much worse.

0:04:08.900,0:04:18.220
Many jump into the waters of the mediterranean before the boat completely capsizes.

0:04:18.220,0:04:23.080
Moments later, it is completely overturned

0:04:23.080,0:04:26.820
Scores swam away from the shipwreck

0:04:26.820,0:04:33.000
but five people were found dead in the water.

0:04:33.000,0:04:39.980
But this man and 561 others were rescued.

0:04:39.980,0:04:45.380
They are now safe but the scenes of utter desperation we witnessed this time last year,

0:04:45.380,0:04:48.860
they constantly repeated themselves.

0:04:48.860,0:05:31.900
Important Message For ALL AFRICANS!!! | T.B. Joshua

0:05:31.900,0:05:36.060
They are your children; they are youth of Africa.

0:05:36.060,0:05:40.180
All - they are youth of Africa.

0:05:40.180,0:05:47.980
There is no country in Africa that is not represented there - all.

0:05:47.980,0:05:54.000
These are your children that claim they have travelled outside the country.

0:05:54.000,0:06:04.480
Many of them are there - looking for green pastures.

0:06:04.480,0:06:10.580
Africa has neglected her youth.

0:06:10.580,0:06:19.820
Africa has abandoned the youth to themselves.

0:06:19.820,0:06:32.800
Africa has failed to provide green pastures.

0:06:32.800,0:06:43.700
When I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.

0:06:43.700,0:06:47.900
Within Africa, if we are now fighting ourselves,

0:06:47.900,0:06:52.680
look at what is happening in other continents concerning Africa.

0:06:52.680,0:07:03.200
Within continents, there is fight among the youth.

0:07:03.200,0:07:19.980
Everything looks gloomy, frustrating, hopeless, dark, darksome, dull and  sunless.

0:07:19.980,0:07:27.000
Africa, unite!

0:07:27.000,0:07:40.180
No African country can succeed alone; we need each other to develop.

0:07:40.180,0:07:46.700
So, if we cannot understand ourselves within Africa,

0:07:46.700,0:07:51.300
do you mean they will understand us in other continents?

0:07:51.300,0:07:56.600
I was so troubled, and the Lord gave me a word:

0:07:56.600,0:08:07.080
I want to volunteer myself, and I know God has touched many Africans.

0:08:07.080,0:08:11.980
I know as I am talking, God has touched many Africans and

0:08:11.980,0:08:19.720
many Africans that are in a position to help and I know many of them are crying.

0:08:19.720,0:08:21.860
I am at your service.

0:08:21.860,0:08:24.100
I will not only sit in the church alone.

0:08:24.100,0:08:26.940
You will learn that I have travelled for a meeting with people

0:08:26.940,0:08:30.660
that are ready to talk about the challenges ahead.

0:08:30.660,0:08:35.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:35.280,0:08:38.660
Yes, look at the ministry.

0:08:38.660,0:08:42.660
All countries, races are inside the church.

0:08:42.660,0:08:45.540
God said, "No, I release you".

0:08:45.540,0:08:49.740
He said he has touched many people that are in the position of honour and authority.

0:08:49.740,0:08:51.680
They are ready. Let's come together.

0:08:51.680,0:08:56.520
Let's talk about the youth that have been neglected.

0:08:56.520,0:08:58.960
They have been neglected.

0:08:58.960,0:09:01.680
They have been abandoned to themselves.

0:09:01.680,0:09:05.200
No provision for our youth.

0:09:05.200,0:09:10.060
When you are counting the best universities in the world,

0:09:10.060,0:09:16.360
you will hardly see a single university from Africa among 1 to 500.

0:09:16.360,0:09:20.320
There is no single African university.

0:09:20.320,0:09:22.620
Can you see the decadence?

0:09:22.620,0:09:28.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:28.120,0:09:34.020
The technology is zero.

0:09:34.020,0:09:41.980
You are flying to Dubai, you are flying to Turkey, you are flying to New York.

0:09:41.980,0:09:45.100
When are they flying into your country?

0:09:45.100,0:09:52.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:52.880,0:09:56.960
Look at your age - are you not going to witness that transformation

0:09:56.960,0:10:04.460
when Africa will become a centre, where people will begin to discover themselves?

0:10:04.460,0:10:08.300
You are getting old.

0:10:08.300,0:10:11.680
Now your children, where is that future for them?

0:10:11.680,0:10:17.560
They have been abandoned.

0:10:17.560,0:10:22.940
Because they have been abandoned, that is the cause of frustration.

0:10:22.940,0:10:26.780
Frustration can make anyone to do anything.

0:10:26.780,0:10:29.420
When you realise you are a graduate and there is no job and

0:10:29.420,0:10:32.200
you are looking at your age and wondering where you are going

0:10:32.200,0:10:39.160
and every day things are becoming worse - it is frustration.

0:10:39.160,0:10:51.680
Dear Africa, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.

0:10:51.680,0:10:52.840
Tell your neighbour.

0:10:52.840,0:11:06.120
Fellow Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.

0:11:06.120,0:11:07.200
Again!

0:11:07.200,0:11:13.620
[Fellow Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.]

0:11:13.620,0:11:23.420
No African country can succeed, can develop alone.

0:11:23.420,0:11:31.980
When it now comes to the issue of people taking drugs to a country or crimes,

0:11:31.980,0:11:40.700
our duty is to work with law enforcement by giving them useful information

0:11:40.700,0:11:45.320
about these people that are doing this.

0:11:45.320,0:11:47.060
That is our duty.

0:11:47.060,0:11:56.700
But if they now fail to do so, then lawfully we can protest.

0:11:56.700,0:12:02.140
Other nations are now laying bans on immigrants;

0:12:02.140,0:12:08.220
definitely, we Africans should awake and rescue our people.

0:12:08.220,0:12:13.440
If there is ban on immigrants, definitely, this is the time we should awake.

0:12:13.440,0:12:15.640
What can we do to rescue our people?

0:12:15.640,0:12:21.840
Because these immigrants we are talking about, 90% are Africans.

0:12:21.840,0:12:25.160
So they are coming back home.

0:12:25.160,0:12:28.140
And many of them are home already.

0:12:28.140,0:12:29.740
Unemployment.

0:12:29.740,0:12:34.480
And millions are coming to join unemployment at home.

0:12:34.480,0:12:36.980
Where is the peace?

0:12:36.980,0:12:40.820
No matter how much you are blessed, you can never have peace

0:12:40.820,0:12:44.400
if people around you are suffering.
