0:00:00.000,0:00:06.640
Viewers all over the world, prayer is a work of faith.

0:00:06.640,0:00:09.540
Have faith in God.

0:00:09.540,0:00:16.680
All things are possible; have faith in God.

0:00:16.680,0:00:26.640
Today, many of us pray but perhaps, not prayer of faith.

0:00:26.640,0:00:31.760
Have faith in God; all things are possible.

0:00:31.760,0:00:36.480
This means, only faith counts.

0:00:36.480,0:00:44.780
Faith comes when we allow the Word of God to dominate our heart.

0:00:44.780,0:00:45.460
Tell your neighbour,

0:00:45.460,0:01:08.540
Faith comes when we allow the Word of God to dominate our heart, our spirit.

0:01:08.540,0:01:14.540
I can sense God touching you right now.

0:01:14.540,0:01:23.220
Viewers, wherever you are, I can sense God touching you right now,

0:01:23.220,0:01:26.240
in Jesus Christ's name!

0:01:26.240,0:01:29.860
Only faith pleases God.

0:01:29.860,0:01:37.900
Say to the Lord, touch me, Lord.

0:01:37.900,0:01:58.560
Let all spirits in your life leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:01:58.560,0:02:14.060
Spirit of stagnation, spirit of affliction, spirit of rejection, spirit of failure, spirit of hardship -

0:02:14.060,0:02:22.520
leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:22.520,0:03:00.000
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back

0:03:00.000,0:03:11.580
Let all spirits operating in your life leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:11.580,0:03:21.960
Spirit of stagnation, spirit of failure, spirit of setback, spirit of barrenness, spirit of affliction -

0:03:21.960,0:03:28.380
leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:28.380,0:03:31.360
Are you on the sickbed?

0:03:31.360,0:03:39.660
I command that affliction to leave you, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:39.660,0:03:48.780
I command that bed of affliction – leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:48.780,0:04:05.760
Be it in your bones, kidneys, liver – wherever in your organs – leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:05.760,0:04:21.560
You affliction, sickness, disease, leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:21.560,0:04:41.880
What manner of man is Jesus
Hallelujah

0:04:41.880,0:04:51.560
Leave, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:51.560,0:05:07.700
I cover your business, career, future, family, marriage with the Blood of Jesus.

0:05:07.700,0:05:10.060
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus’ Name

0:05:10.060,0:05:15.800
In Jesus Christ's name we pray!

0:05:15.800,0:05:17.820
This is habit.

0:05:17.820,0:05:21.680
I want to tell you a little about my habit.

0:05:21.680,0:05:25.140
Habit is a gift from God.

0:05:25.140,0:05:32.820
Constantly pray in your heart.

0:05:32.820,0:05:37.920
As I am talking to you, there is prayer going on.

0:05:37.920,0:05:41.440
As I am looking at you, there is prayer going on.

0:05:41.440,0:05:52.340
Constantly pray – prayer without ceasing

0:05:52.340,0:06:13.680
in hymns, spiritual songs in your heart.

0:06:13.680,0:06:16.980
At the beginning, it may be very difficult

0:06:16.980,0:06:27.720
but as you continue, the Lord comes into the matter, helps to do it for you.

0:06:27.720,0:06:31.580
To show your genuine willingness, you have to start on your own.

0:06:31.580,0:06:34.580
Peter said, “I want to come with You, Lord, on the sea”.

0:06:34.580,0:06:37.240
He said, “Come!”

0:06:37.240,0:06:45.140
Peter was thinking that from the beginning, Jesus would help to carry him spiritually

0:06:45.140,0:06:49.120
but Peter moved on his own.

0:06:49.120,0:07:02.240
As he moved on his own, he found himself drowning – going down the sea.

0:07:02.240,0:07:07.840
When he was about to disappear, only his hand remained up in the sea.

0:07:07.840,0:07:15.560
Jesus realised, "Oh no, that is genuine willingness".

0:07:15.560,0:07:43.280
I will make you fishers of men
If you follow Me

0:07:43.280,0:07:46.100
To make you a fisher of men,

0:07:46.100,0:07:53.380
you become a deliverer, healer...

0:07:53.380,0:08:00.320
People have problems; you remove their problems, you point them the way, "This is the way".

0:08:00.320,0:08:05.580
If someone is thirsty, you cannot give water, you cannot tell him the way.

0:08:05.580,0:08:10.740
If someone is hungry, you cannot give food, you cannot tell him the way.

0:08:10.740,0:08:16.580
When someone is thirsty, needs water and you give water, he will say, "Ah" -

0:08:16.580,0:08:23.940
"Where are you going? Take this way" - he will follow.

0:08:23.940,0:08:57.660
I will make you fishers of men
If you follow Me

0:08:57.660,0:09:01.640
This is Jesus for you.

0:09:01.640,0:09:08.220
You are to start, take my habit – constantly pray in your heart.

0:09:08.220,0:09:13.260
When you are doing this, it cannot affect any other thing you are doing.

0:09:13.260,0:09:20.640
You can still talk to your neighbour while you are doing that – constantly pray in your heart.

0:09:20.640,0:09:29.540
That is prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:09:29.540,0:09:44.980
This is what I do – I meditate day and night on the Word and whatever I do prospers.

0:09:44.980,0:09:48.040
Do that and see what will happen.

0:09:48.040,0:09:53.400
When you are going to work, you wake up in the morning,

0:09:53.400,0:09:58.800
"In the name of Jesus, in the Blood of Jesus..."

0:09:58.800,0:10:00.520
Even that is enough.

0:10:00.520,0:10:04.620
"In the name of Jesus, in the Blood of Jesus", in your heart.

0:10:04.620,0:10:07.460
And people would greet you, "How are you?" - "Fine."

0:10:07.460,0:10:11.380
"... in the name of Jesus, in the Blood of Jesus..."

0:10:11.380,0:10:14.040
What do you need the name of Jesus, the Blood of Jesus for?

0:10:14.040,0:10:16.160
For sanctification.

0:10:16.160,0:10:19.800
Our heart is so funny.

0:10:19.800,0:10:26.340
Flesh, spirit - there is so much conflict.

0:10:26.340,0:10:30.740
Your desire and God's desire - conflict.

0:10:30.740,0:10:41.980
There is so much division; "Steal - don't steal. Fight - don't fight. Help - don't help him. For and against" -

0:10:41.980,0:10:44.200
this is our heart.

0:10:44.200,0:10:51.820
To sanctify this heart and make it focused; just one focus, one way.

0:10:51.820,0:11:14.100
One way
Only one way to Heaven

0:11:14.100,0:11:23.900
I’m so glad
I’m so glad that Jesus is the Way

0:11:23.900,0:11:26.600
The way, not a way.

0:11:26.600,0:11:33.120
When your heart begins to say, "Go this way, that way" - you know there is trouble.

0:11:33.120,0:11:38.880
The way, not a way.

0:11:38.880,0:11:44.820
I meditate on the Word day and night.

0:11:44.820,0:11:46.860
When I say; “On the Word”,

0:11:46.860,0:11:54.740
I mean, constantly pray in my heart

0:11:54.740,0:11:58.700
in hymns - you have many hymns -

0:11:58.700,0:12:04.800
"Take more of me, give me more of You, oh Lord Jesus"

0:12:04.800,0:12:08.940
You should be busy with that.

0:12:08.940,0:12:12.000
Melody in your heart.

0:12:12.000,0:12:32.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:32.380,0:12:38.260
You are inviting Him; He will come at a time you are not expecting.

0:12:38.260,0:12:41.620
Once He takes over that heart, He will take control.

0:12:41.620,0:12:51.620
Yet, now, you are wrestling - there is so much conflict between this and that.

0:12:51.620,0:12:58.940
Take care of your heart – that is my habit.

0:12:58.940,0:13:04.000
You may stay with me for one day, you will not see me going to the prayer room to pray.

0:13:04.000,0:13:10.720
You will say, "Does it mean that he doesn't pray? But it is a prophet, I have not seen him today praying.

0:13:10.720,0:13:16.500
I have been seeing him moving around; he didn't even go on his knees to pray."

0:13:16.500,0:13:18.120
Oh, who told you I don't pray?

0:13:18.120,0:13:22.940
24 hours, 24/7 my heart is praying.

0:13:22.940,0:13:23.640
Hallelujah!

0:13:23.640,0:13:26.840
Viewers all over the world, please take care of your heart.

0:13:26.840,0:13:34.420
My habit – habit is a gift from God.

0:13:34.420,0:13:45.780
Pray without ceasing – constantly pray in your heart in hymns, spiritual songs,

0:13:45.780,0:13:54.380
make melodies in your heart to the Lord.

0:13:54.380,0:14:00.060
Everywhere is quiet, but hearts should engage in what?

0:14:00.060,0:14:01.020
In prayer.

0:14:01.020,0:14:01.520
