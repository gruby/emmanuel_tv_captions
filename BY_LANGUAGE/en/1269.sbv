0:00:00.000,0:00:04.440
Viewers, you will not expect me to say, "Breakthrough".

0:00:04.440,0:00:07.540
Even if there is a breakthrough, without the Word of God in your heart,

0:00:07.540,0:00:10.580
will you be able to maintain breakthrough?

0:00:10.580,0:00:14.440
Don't let us deceive ourselves. Vanity upon vanity.

0:00:14.440,0:00:18.200
Even if there is a breakthrough for you and there is no Word of God in your heart,

0:00:18.200,0:00:20.080
how will you maintain it?

0:00:20.080,0:00:24.540
It's better not to have breakthrough than to have it and lose it.

0:00:24.540,0:00:28.820
Indeed, I hear breakthrough but I don't know how you will maintain it

0:00:28.820,0:00:34.340
because without the Word of God in your heart, it will be difficult to maintain.

0:00:34.340,0:00:39.320
What you have received in the past is what you are here for again today.

0:00:39.320,0:00:43.340
Your business was going well but suddenly went down.

0:00:43.340,0:00:49.160
You cannot maintain this blessing without the Word of God in your heart.

0:00:49.160,0:00:52.980
Look at your marriage: The thing was smooth but later...

0:00:52.980,0:00:56.220
You cannot maintain them without the Word of God in your heart.

0:00:56.220,0:01:01.080
Look at what is going on: things go...

0:01:01.080,0:01:07.340
You will not be able to maintain your life without the Word of God in your heart.

0:01:07.340,0:01:14.500
Tell your neighbour, "My heart, hear the voice of God".

0:01:14.500,0:01:18.100
If I were you, this is what I would continue to meditate on.

0:01:18.100,0:01:20.300
Your heart is the real man.

0:01:20.300,0:01:23.980
You - just your appearance is a camouflage.

0:01:23.980,0:01:28.260
Tell your neighbour, "Your appearance is a camouflage.

0:01:28.260,0:01:32.240
The real person is your heart".

0:01:32.240,0:01:34.820
Tell your neighbour; face your neighbour.

0:01:34.820,0:01:40.000
Say, "My appearance is a camouflage".

0:01:40.000,0:01:43.820
Maybe you may not understand the camouflage I am talking about.

0:01:43.820,0:01:49.380
You know soldiers? When they are going to war, they put on the uniform.

0:01:49.380,0:01:51.880
That uniform is a camouflage.

0:01:51.880,0:01:53.760
What is working in them is their heart;

0:01:53.760,0:01:59.220
how they control strategy and tactic, holding gun and ammunition.

0:01:59.220,0:02:03.640
But the uniform they put on is just... - anybody can wear uniform.

0:02:03.640,0:02:09.620
Say to your neighbour, "My appearance is a camouflage.

0:02:09.620,0:02:15.220
My heart is the main man".

0:02:15.220,0:02:22.580
Viewers, the Word in our heart is our contact with God.

0:02:22.580,0:02:28.720
I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:02:28.720,0:02:31.380
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:02:31.380,0:02:33.020
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:02:33.020,0:02:38.780
The Holy Spirit is at the door of your heart,

0:02:38.780,0:02:44.420
knocking the door of your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:02:44.420,0:02:46.380
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:02:46.380,0:02:49.420
You must have a free heart.

0:02:49.420,0:02:53.760
By this free heart, your heart can contact the Holy Spirit,

0:02:53.760,0:02:56.040
have access to the Holy Spirit.

0:02:56.040,0:03:00.400
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:00.400,0:03:05.020
I say to my heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:03:05.020,0:03:08.860
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:08.860,0:03:10.860
Yes.

0:03:10.860,0:03:13.340
Like I have said:

0:03:13.340,0:03:24.400
Committing the Word of God to memory is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.

0:03:24.400,0:03:28.200
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:28.200,0:03:33.540
I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:03:33.540,0:03:43.440
Learning the Hebrew, whatever language in the Bible, the history of the Books of the Bible

0:03:43.440,0:03:48.220
is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.

0:03:48.220,0:03:51.880
I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:03:51.880,0:03:54.280
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:03:54.280,0:03:56.580
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:03:56.580,0:04:03.480
To celebrate a new year is to celebrate it with all your heart.

0:04:03.480,0:04:13.420
Any celebration, if your heart does not act with the Word of God, nothing can be achieved.

0:04:13.420,0:04:16.240
In the name of God, nothing can be achieved.

0:04:16.240,0:04:18.960
In the name of Jesus, nothing can be achieved.

0:04:18.960,0:04:25.180
No one can say, "Jesus is the Lord" without the Word of God in the heart.

0:04:25.180,0:04:32.140
I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:04:32.140,0:04:34.220
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:04:34.220,0:04:45.500
Whatever our heart engages on influences our conduct and our character.

0:04:45.500,0:04:49.940
Your heart, hear the voice of God, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:49.940,0:04:56.340
Hear the voice of God, in the name of Jesus!

0:04:56.340,0:05:01.720
The same heart, the Holy Spirit expresses Himself through.

0:05:01.720,0:05:04.420
He wants to talk to you through your heart.

0:05:04.420,0:05:07.240
Heart means your spirit.

0:05:07.240,0:05:11.620
I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"

0:05:11.620,0:05:15.180
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:15.180,0:05:19.080
Now, how do we awake this heart?

0:05:19.080,0:05:26.660
The Bible says you become an integral part of the Word of God by meditation.

0:05:26.660,0:05:30.660
Awake, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:30.660,0:05:37.200
Become an integral part, in the name of Jesus!

0:05:37.200,0:05:39.860
Thank You, Lord, in Jesus' name.

0:05:39.860,0:05:42.400
