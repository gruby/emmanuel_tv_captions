0:00:00.000,0:00:07.200
Right now, this is the time now to strengthen your relationship with Jesus.

0:00:07.200,0:00:15.080
You have listened to the message today; that message is for you and for me.

0:00:15.080,0:00:20.500
In the Church we have two Christs:

0:00:20.500,0:00:33.220
The Christ of history and story and song - the baby Jesus.

0:00:33.220,0:00:45.120
Then, there is this Christ which the Holy Spirit reveals to us.

0:00:45.120,0:00:52.760
Which one are you following?

0:00:52.760,0:01:04.380
You cannot know Jesus without the help of the Holy Ghost.

0:01:04.380,0:01:11.240
Worshipping Jesus without the help of the Holy Ghost is worshipping a god you do not know.

0:01:11.240,0:01:27.520
You can read your New Testament over and over and still never find Jesus in it.

0:01:27.520,0:01:41.660
You can be convinced that He is the Son of God and still not find Jesus.

0:01:41.660,0:02:00.960
You can know about Jesus Christ dying for you and still never know Jesus.

0:02:00.960,0:02:15.060
You can be a publisher of the Bible and still never know Jesus.

0:02:15.060,0:02:24.440
Where is Jesus? Jesus is in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:02:24.440,0:02:33.880
If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.

0:02:33.880,0:02:35.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:02:35.220,0:02:40.240
If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.

0:02:40.240,0:02:41.480
Again.

0:02:41.480,0:02:45.960
If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.

0:02:45.960,0:02:47.240
Again.

0:02:47.240,0:02:51.520
If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.

0:02:51.520,0:02:53.920
Take your pen and write it down.

0:02:53.920,0:03:07.360
If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.

0:03:07.360,0:03:12.920
Because you don't know Jesus that is why you can run to spiritualists.

0:03:12.920,0:03:17.360
You can run to this. You can run to spiritualists.

0:03:17.360,0:03:23.200
You can run to that. You keep running.

0:03:23.200,0:03:30.660
Because you have not learnt to worship one Man.

0:03:30.660,0:03:39.760
If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.

0:03:39.760,0:03:57.820
I love the Man of Galilee
For He has done so very much for me

0:03:57.820,0:04:08.120
He has forgiven me all my sins
And sent the Holy Ghost to me

0:04:08.120,0:04:19.660
I love that Man of Galilee

0:04:19.660,0:04:30.960
The most dangerous one is that if you are not filled with the Spirit of God,

0:04:30.960,0:04:34.520
you cannot obey the written Word.

0:04:34.520,0:04:41.920
So then, what is your business with the Bible?

0:04:41.920,0:04:52.180
Tell your neighbour: The most dangerous - if you are not filled with the Spirit of God,

0:04:52.180,0:05:00.200
there is no way you can obey the written Word!

0:05:00.200,0:05:06.280
If you cannot obey the written Word, you quench Him.

0:05:06.280,0:05:10.060
So what is your business with the Bible then, when you are not filled with the Spirit,

0:05:10.060,0:05:15.900
when you are carrying it, carrying it to cause confusions all over.

0:05:15.900,0:05:21.880
You say, "This one is not good. That religion is not good. that one is not good".

0:05:21.880,0:05:25.980
That is the confusion we are having all over the world today.

0:05:25.980,0:05:30.380
Accusing this, accusing that, other religion, shouting this and that.

0:05:30.380,0:05:32.920
Is that what we are taught?

0:05:32.920,0:05:39.940
If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you cannot obey this Bible.

0:05:39.940,0:05:45.220
And if you cannot obey this Bible, you quench Him.

0:05:45.220,0:05:47.520
So what is your business with the Bible?

0:05:47.520,0:05:50.620
"I am Christian" - you see everyone with the Bible.

0:05:50.620,0:05:54.500
Everyone with the Cross, big big Bible.

0:05:54.500,0:05:58.780
There is no Bible now - it is laptop everyone is having.

0:05:58.780,0:06:04.060
The Bible they are supposed to carry is inside the laptop.

0:06:04.060,0:06:14.500
Tell your neighbour: If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you cannot obey the written Word.

0:06:14.500,0:06:22.220
And if you cannot obey the written Word, you quench Him.

0:06:22.220,0:06:35.760
If your faith is to be a New Testament, if Jesus is to be the Christ of God

0:06:35.760,0:06:45.460
rather than the Christ of history and stories, then the illumination of the Holy Spirit

0:06:45.460,0:06:55.140
will tell your heart that you are worshipping Him, learning at His feet.

0:06:55.140,0:07:04.520
Right now, the business of today: Talk to yourself in your heart; keep your heart busy.

0:07:04.520,0:07:11.760
Begin to meditate right now. Meditate in His Word.

0:07:11.760,0:07:25.940
Hymn in your heart, spiritual song - keep your heart busy with songs of praise.

0:07:25.940,0:07:36.520
I will praise Him
I will praise Him forevermore

0:07:36.520,0:07:40.820
Keep your heart busy with this.

0:07:40.820,0:07:44.700
Soon, you will be filled.

0:07:44.700,0:07:47.880
I will praise Him

0:07:47.880,0:07:53.280
Keep your heart busy.

0:07:53.280,0:07:58.440
Forevermore

0:07:58.440,0:08:13.580
In my situation I will praise Him
I will praise Him forevermore

0:08:13.580,0:08:28.120
In my affliction I will praise Him
I will praise Him forevermore

0:08:28.120,0:08:33.520
Your affliction is not to kill you.

0:08:33.520,0:08:40.440
It is not to kill you but to strengthen your desire and determination for God.

0:08:40.440,0:08:43.680
That's all. That is the purpose of that.

0:08:43.680,0:08:46.780
Once you start praising Him, your affliction is not to kill you

0:08:46.780,0:08:54.380
but to strengthen your desire and determination for God.

0:08:54.380,0:09:09.240
In my situation I will praise Him
I will praise Him forevermore

0:09:09.240,0:09:15.280
So, keep your heart busy with this all the time.

0:09:15.280,0:09:17.440
That is it.

0:09:17.440,0:09:24.840
A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break with God.

0:09:24.840,0:09:26.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:09:26.080,0:09:46.840
A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break with God.

0:09:46.840,0:10:00.300
When you have a break in your heart, when you stop meditating or praising God, satan comes.

0:10:00.300,0:10:02.980
Your heart - continue right now.

0:10:02.980,0:10:06.820
Are you doing that now in your heart?

0:10:06.820,0:10:12.260
"I will praise Him" - when you are eating...

0:10:12.260,0:10:17.120
Soon, you will be filled with the Spirit.

0:10:17.120,0:10:19.740
That is how to invite the Spirit of God.

0:10:19.740,0:10:29.520
Our heart is in a strong conflict - there is a conflict between the flesh and spirit.

0:10:29.520,0:10:33.500
"Go - don't go; come - don't come." - that is what is going on in our hearts.

0:10:33.500,0:10:38.860
Our heart is busy. There is a conflict.

0:10:38.860,0:10:41.160
There is a division in our hearts.

0:10:41.160,0:10:45.020
When this is out, the Landlord will take over.

0:10:45.020,0:10:51.660
Jesus is not a tenant; He is the Landlord. He is the owner of your heart.

0:10:51.660,0:10:57.920
But your heart is divided now: There is for and against in your heart.

0:10:57.920,0:11:02.580
When this is cleared, then you invite the Holy Ghost.

0:11:02.580,0:11:07.740
Our heart is the contact point, the communication point.

0:11:07.740,0:11:09.440
So start with this.

0:11:09.440,0:11:12.500
I will praise Him

0:11:12.500,0:11:18.180
Continue this in your heart.

0:11:18.180,0:11:23.620
By the time you continue this, it is not for you to choose the prayer to offer.

0:11:23.620,0:11:28.980
The heart will switch into prayer, switch into speaking in tongues.

0:11:28.980,0:11:32.080
You just hear a prayer in your heart.

0:11:32.080,0:11:35.480
It's not just for you to choose a prayer; just praise Him.

0:11:35.480,0:11:38.760
We are created to praise God.

0:11:38.760,0:11:45.540
You are created to praise God, your heart to praise God.

0:11:45.540,0:11:52.420
Your heart.

0:11:52.420,0:11:59.740
Thank You, Lord.

0:11:59.740,0:12:02.540
This is the prayer for you now.

0:12:02.540,0:12:06.020
The prayer you have been offering, "Jesus do this for me, Jesus...",

0:12:06.020,0:12:11.780
an hour of prayer - that cannot work for you because you are not strong

0:12:11.780,0:12:16.080
You are a baby when it come to things of the Spirit.

0:12:16.080,0:12:19.060
You need to build your foundation first.

0:12:19.060,0:12:26.020
Your foundation is to keep your heart busy with praising.

0:12:26.020,0:12:29.440
You are still crawling. You are a baby, just a baby.

0:12:29.440,0:12:32.680
You cannot offer prayer here now because whom are you praying to?

0:12:32.680,0:12:34.720
- To a god you do not know.

0:12:34.720,0:12:38.120
Do you know God? - You don't know God and you are praying.

0:12:38.120,0:12:40.780
How can you pray to a god you do not know?

0:12:40.780,0:12:43.460
Until you know God before you pray.

0:12:43.460,0:12:46.440
If you don't know your Father, can you ask your Father things?

0:12:46.440,0:12:49.480
You need to know your Father before you pray, before you ask your Father.

0:12:49.480,0:12:54.420
But yet now, you don't know your Father because there is no Holy Spirit.

0:12:54.420,0:13:00.820
Tell your neighbour: You need to know God before prayer.

0:13:00.820,0:13:06.560
But if you don't know God and you are praying, whom are you praying to?

0:13:06.560,0:13:11.540
Foundation first - get your heart to your side.

0:13:11.540,0:13:15.940
Your heart is not on your side. It's like your heart is somewhere

0:13:15.940,0:13:20.180
When you are looking at me, your heart will say, "Hm, can T.B. Joshua do it?

0:13:20.180,0:13:24.360
Hm, look at what is happening. Oh, time is going.

0:13:24.360,0:13:28.280
This man should finish quickly. Someone is waiting for me".

0:13:28.280,0:13:31.780
Your heart keeps jumping, jumping. Your heart is not on your side.

0:13:31.780,0:13:37.340
Until you get your heart to your side, then the Holy Spirit comes in.

0:13:37.340,0:13:42.500
Tell your neighbour: Get your heart to your side.

0:13:42.500,0:13:44.400
So now your heart:

0:13:44.400,0:13:56.500
I will praise Him
I will praise Him forevermore

0:13:56.500,0:14:06.680
Let this one keep running in your heart all the time, all day long.

0:14:06.680,0:14:10.080
Even when you are sleeping, till you sleep off.

0:14:10.080,0:14:13.520
This is why we give you faith bracelets to help on the outside.

0:14:13.520,0:14:17.720
Build the foundation before prayer. Know your Father before prayer.

0:14:17.720,0:14:21.080
You don't know God and you are praying to God.

0:14:21.080,0:14:25.720
How can you pray to a god you do not know? If you know Him, He will answer you.

0:14:25.720,0:14:29.340
But this time you pray - no answer because you don't know Him.

0:14:29.340,0:14:32.440
Someone keeps telling you, "This is your God, Jesus is your God".

0:14:32.440,0:14:37.500
But you are trying to know God in what way? - Without the Holy Ghost.

0:14:37.500,0:14:42.240
When you know your God, He will tell you, "Pray this time, meet me this time, appointment this time".

0:14:42.240,0:14:45.840
God relates to all like a father.

0:14:45.840,0:14:49.740
Like I am talking now - if I hear, "It's alright", I will just say the grace and leave from here.

0:14:49.740,0:14:55.200
Tell your neighbour: You need to know God before prayer.

0:14:55.200,0:15:00.080
If you don't know God, whom are you praying to?

0:15:00.080,0:15:13.540
This is the time for foundation. Get your heart to your side; the Holy Spirit will come in.

0:15:13.540,0:15:18.480
Thank You, Lord. This is a special grace.

0:15:18.480,0:15:29.240
The Word given to you today - be a hearer, in the name of Jesus!

0:15:29.240,0:15:36.200
Right now, open your lips and confess whom you are now.

0:15:36.200,0:15:39.100
I am what God says I am!

0:15:39.100,0:15:45.700
I can do what God says I can do!

0:15:45.700,0:15:48.620
I have what God says I have!

0:15:48.620,0:15:51.640
Confess it - that is the platform now.

0:15:51.640,0:15:54.600
I am what God says I am!

0:15:54.600,0:15:57.600
I can do what God says I can do!

0:15:57.600,0:16:01.640
I am what God says I am!

0:16:01.640,0:16:05.900
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:16:05.900,0:16:11.080
Can someone tell me, "What is your problem now?" You should be able to tell me.

0:16:11.080,0:16:15.840
All these challenges, sickness - sickness is not a problem,

0:16:15.840,0:16:18.780
setback is not a problem, stagnation is not a problem.

0:16:18.780,0:16:27.100
The problem is: We don't know God we are praying to.

0:16:27.100,0:16:29.980
If you know me, you talk to me and I will answer you.

0:16:29.980,0:16:32.500
If I cannot tell you, I will tell you, "Hold on".

0:16:32.500,0:16:36.980
But this is absent. When we pray, we don't hear from God.

0:16:36.980,0:16:41.820
"In the name of Jesus, do it for me!" - why can't you wait and let God reply?

0:16:41.820,0:16:44.760
We pray and say, "Amen".

0:16:44.760,0:16:48.980
It is two sides - you talk, God talks.

0:16:48.980,0:16:51.780
That is God - real God.

0:16:51.780,0:16:53.260
God talks.

0:16:53.260,0:16:55.340
If you are my father, "How are you, sir?"

0:16:55.340,0:16:57.040
"I am doing fine."

0:16:57.040,0:16:58.880
- "How are doing?"
- "I'm doing okay."

0:16:58.880,0:17:00.800
That is God.

0:17:00.800,0:17:05.560
But in this case today, we are the only person that is talking.

0:17:05.560,0:17:14.500
We never hear from Father, Jesus.

0:17:14.500,0:17:15.940
Open your lips.

0:17:15.940,0:17:22.200
Make us a channel of faithfulness, a channel of shining light.

0:17:22.200,0:17:25.340
Make us Your channel of love.

0:17:25.340,0:17:30.060
Make us Your channel of pardon.

0:17:30.060,0:17:37.040
Make us Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.

0:17:37.040,0:17:43.760
Make us Your channel of faithfulness, in Jesus Christ's name.

0:17:43.760,0:17:48.460
You are a channel of God. As you are going now, anywhere you are, you are a channel.

0:17:48.460,0:17:51.540
He has no mouth but your mouth to talk.

0:17:51.540,0:17:54.920
He has no hands but your hands.

0:17:54.920,0:17:57.620
He has no feet but your feet.

0:17:57.620,0:18:10.700
I am a channel of God - channel of love, pardon, forgiveness, faithfulness, obedience.

0:18:10.700,0:18:14.620
In Jesus' name. Amen!

0:18:14.620,0:18:15.780
I can't hear you.

0:18:15.780,0:18:17.400
Amen!

0:18:17.400,0:18:17.900
