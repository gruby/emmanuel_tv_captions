0:00:00.000,0:00:07.560
Right now; this is the time now to strengthen your relationship with Jesus.

0:00:07.560,0:00:15.080
You have listened to the message today, that message is for you and for me.

0:00:15.080,0:00:20.060
In the church we have two Christs

0:00:20.060,0:00:34.000
The Christ -  of history and story and song; the baby Jesus

0:00:34.000,0:00:45.640
Then, there is this Christ which the Holy Spirit  reveals to us.

0:00:45.640,0:00:52.440
Which one are you following?

0:00:52.440,0:01:04.380
You can not know Jesus without the help of Holy Ghost.

0:01:04.380,0:01:10.820
Worshiping Jesus without the help of Holy Ghost is worshiping God you do not know.

0:01:10.820,0:01:27.980
You can read your New Testament, over and over and over and still never find Jesus in it.

0:01:27.980,0:01:42.180
You can be convinced that He is the son of God and still not find Jesus.

0:01:42.180,0:02:00.480
You can know about Jesus Christ dying for you and still never know Jesus.

0:02:00.480,0:02:14.820
You can be a publisher of the bible and still never know Jesus.

0:02:14.820,0:02:24.020
Where is Jesus? Jesus is in the power of  Holy Ghost.

0:02:24.020,0:02:35.220
If you have learnt to worship one Man; you will not worship other men.Tell you neighbor

0:02:35.220,0:02:52.080
If you have learnt to worship one Man; you will not worship other men (again)

0:02:52.080,0:02:54.080
Take your pen   and write it down.

0:02:54.080,0:03:07.360
If you have learnt to worship one Man; you will not worship other men.

0:03:07.360,0:03:12.920
Because you don't know Jesus that is why you can run to spiritualist.

0:03:12.920,0:03:17.860
You can run to this. You can run to spiritualist.

0:03:17.860,0:03:23.200
You can run to that. You keep running, you keep running. You keep finding God.You keep finding God.

0:03:23.200,0:03:31.140
Because you have not learnt to worship one Man.

0:03:31.140,0:03:40.680
If you have learnt to worship one Man; you will not worship other men.

0:03:40.680,0:03:58.280
I love the Man of Galilee. For He has done so very much for me.

0:03:58.280,0:04:08.620
He has forgiven me all my sins and send the Holy Ghost to me.

0:04:08.620,0:04:19.660
I love that Man of Galilee.

0:04:19.660,0:04:31.420
The most dangerous one is that if you are not filled with the Spirit of God;

0:04:31.420,0:04:40.500
you can not obey the written Word. So then.. what is your business with the Bible?

0:04:40.500,0:04:42.540
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:04:42.540,0:04:52.880
Tell your neighbor; the most dangerous - if you are not filled with the Spirit of God,

0:04:52.880,0:05:00.440
there is no way you can obey the written Word!

0:05:00.440,0:05:06.740
If you can not obey the written Word, you quench Him.

0:05:06.740,0:05:09.840
So what is your business with the Bible then, when you are not filled with the Spirit

0:05:09.840,0:05:17.820
when you are carrying  it? Carry it, to cause confusions all over. You say this one is no good.

0:05:17.820,0:05:26.100
That religion is not good, that one is not good.That is the confusion we are having all over the world today.

0:05:26.100,0:05:32.480
Accusing this accusing that, other religion, shouting this and that. Is that what we are taught?

0:05:32.480,0:05:39.880
If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you can not obey this Bible.

0:05:39.880,0:05:45.860
And if you can not obey this Bible; you quench Him.

0:05:45.860,0:05:50.980
So what is your business with the Bible? I am Christian, you see everyone with the Bible.

0:05:50.980,0:05:57.540
Everyone with the Cross. Big big Bible. Laptop not...there is no Bible now, it's laptop.

0:05:57.540,0:06:01.700
Everyone is having. The Bible they are supposed to is inside the laptops.

0:06:01.700,0:06:04.640
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:06:04.640,0:06:14.500
Tell your neighbour - If you are not filled with the Spirit of God; you can not obey the written Word.

0:06:14.500,0:06:22.680
And if you can not obey the written Word; you quench Him.

0:06:22.680,0:06:36.280
If your faith is to be a New Testament ; if Jesus is to be the Christ of God.

0:06:36.280,0:06:45.460
Rather than the Christ of history, and stories, then the illumination of Holy Spirit

0:06:45.460,0:06:55.560
will tell your heart that you are worshiping Him. You are learning at His feet.

0:06:55.560,0:07:05.020
So right now the business of the day; talk to yourself your heart  keep your heart busy.

0:07:05.020,0:07:13.460
Begin to meditate right now. Meditate  in his Word. Hymn in your heart,

0:07:13.460,0:07:17.320
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:07:17.320,0:07:26.560
Hymn in your heart. Spiritual song. Keep your heart busy with songs of praise.

0:07:26.560,0:07:36.880
I will praise Him. I will praise Him. I will praise him forever more.

0:07:36.880,0:07:45.040
Keep your heart busy with this. Soon you will be filled.

0:07:45.040,0:07:59.120
I will praise Him. Keep your heart busy. Keep your heart busy. I will praise you for ever more.

0:07:59.120,0:08:13.640
In my situation; I will praise Him. I will praise Him. I will praise Him for ever more.

0:08:13.640,0:08:28.120
In my affliction; I will praise Him. I will praise Him. I will praise Him for ever more.

0:08:28.120,0:08:40.840
Your affliction is not to kill you, it's not to kill you but to strengthen your desire and your determination for God.

0:08:40.840,0:08:45.240
That's all. That is the purpose of that.Once you start praising Him;

0:08:45.240,0:08:55.280
your affliction is not to kill you  but to strengthen your desire and your determination for God.

0:08:55.280,0:09:09.560
In my situation;

0:09:09.560,0:09:18.080
So, keep your heart busy with this all the time.

0:09:18.080,0:09:26.080
A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break  with God. Tell your neighbor.

0:09:26.080,0:09:32.940
A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break  with God.

0:09:32.940,0:09:46.420
A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break  with God.

0:09:46.420,0:10:00.680
So when you have  a break in your heart;  when you stop meditating or praising God, satan comes.

0:10:00.680,0:10:07.340
Your heart, continue right now. Are you doing that  now in your heart?

0:10:07.340,0:10:12.960
I will praise Him. I will praise Him. When you are eating, when you are ...

0:10:12.960,0:10:20.320
Soon you will be filled by the Spirit. That is how to invite the Spirit of God.

0:10:20.320,0:10:29.940
Our heart is , is in a strong conflict. There is a conflict between the flesh and Spirit.

0:10:29.940,0:10:34.000
Go, don't go; come don't come. That is what is going on in our hearts.

0:10:34.000,0:10:39.440
Our heart is busy. There is a conflict. Strong...I mean

0:10:39.440,0:10:45.340
There is a division in our hearts. Until this is out; landlord will take over.

0:10:45.340,0:10:52.200
Jesus is not a tenant. He is not a tenant. He is the Landlord He is the owner of your heart.

0:10:52.200,0:10:57.920
But your heart is divided now. There is for; there is against in your heart.

0:10:57.920,0:11:02.700
So unless this is cleared, then you invite the Holy Ghost.

0:11:02.700,0:11:09.440
Our heart is the contact point. The communication point. So start with this.

0:11:09.440,0:11:18.840
I will praise Him. I will ....Continue , your heart should continue this. Continue this.

0:11:18.840,0:11:24.180
By the time you continue this, it's not for you to choose the prayer to offer.

0:11:24.180,0:11:30.700
The heart will switch into prayer, will switch into speaking in tongues. You just hear a prayer in your heart.

0:11:30.700,0:11:35.480
Just hearing. It's not just for you to choose a prayer, just praise Him.

0:11:35.480,0:11:45.920
We are created to praise God. You are created to praise God. Your heart to praise God.

0:11:45.920,0:12:00.320
Your heart, your heart, your heart, your heart, your heart. Thank you Lord.Thank you Lord.

0:12:00.320,0:12:03.640
So this the prayer for you now. The prayer you have been offering

0:12:03.640,0:12:10.440
Jesus do this for me,  Jesus.... hour of prayer; that can not work for you.

0:12:10.440,0:12:16.480
Because you are not strong, you are a baby when it come to things of the spirit, you a baby.

0:12:16.480,0:12:19.060
You need to build your foundation is first.

0:12:19.060,0:12:26.140
Your foundation is to keep your heart busy with praising.

0:12:26.140,0:12:31.420
You are still crawling. You are a baby, just a baby. You can not offer prayer here now.

0:12:31.420,0:12:34.860
because whom are you praying to God you do not know.

0:12:34.860,0:12:40.280
Do you know God? You don't know God and you are praying.  How can you pray to God you do not know?

0:12:40.280,0:12:46.780
Until you know God before you pray; If you don't know your father can you ask your father things?

0:12:46.780,0:12:49.900
You  need to know your father before you pray, before you ask your father.

0:12:49.900,0:12:54.560
But here now; you don't know your father because there is no Holy Spirit.

0:12:54.560,0:13:01.420
Tell your neighbour -  you need to know God  before prayer.

0:13:01.420,0:13:06.560
But if you don't know God and you are praying, whom are you praying to.

0:13:06.560,0:13:14.300
So foundation first. Get your heart to your side. Your heart is not on your side.

0:13:14.300,0:13:18.500
It's like your heart is somewhere When you are looking at me, your heart will say

0:13:18.500,0:13:24.180
mmm can T.B. Joshua do it? hmm look at what is happening aah ooh. Time is going.

0:13:24.180,0:13:27.940
This man should finish quick. Aah someone is waiting for me.

0:13:27.940,0:13:32.020
Your heart keep jumping jumping. Your heart is not on your side.

0:13:32.020,0:13:37.880
Until you get your heart to your side then Holy Spirit comes in.

0:13:37.880,0:13:42.580
Tell your neighbour - get your heart  to your side

0:13:42.580,0:13:56.700
So now your heart; I will praise Him. I will praise Him.  I will praise Him for ever more.

0:13:56.700,0:14:04.720
All the time, all the time , let this one run, let this one keep running, keep running in your heart all the time,

0:14:04.720,0:14:10.080
all day long. Even when you are sleeping till you sleep off.

0:14:10.080,0:14:13.340
This is why we give you faith bracelet to help on the outside.

0:14:13.340,0:14:17.860
Build the foundation before prayer.  Know the father before prayer.

0:14:17.860,0:14:21.240
You don't know God and you are praying to God.

0:14:21.240,0:14:26.120
How can you pray to God you do not know? If you know Him , He will answer you.

0:14:26.120,0:14:29.340
But this time  you pray; no answer because you don't know him.

0:14:29.340,0:14:33.900
Someone keep telling you , this is your God, Jesus is your God. But you are trying to know God

0:14:33.900,0:14:37.200
In what way without the Holy Ghost.

0:14:37.200,0:14:42.600
When you know your God, He will tell you pray this time, meet me this time, appointment this time.

0:14:42.600,0:14:47.940
God relates to all like a father. He relate to all. Like I am talking now if I hear it's alright

0:14:47.940,0:14:50.480
I will just say the Grace and leave here. Tell your neighbour -

0:14:50.480,0:15:00.580
You need to know God before prayer. If you don't know God; who are you praying to ?

0:15:00.580,0:15:13.440
This is the time for foundation.  Get your heart to your side; Holy Spirit will come in.

0:15:13.440,0:15:18.480
Thank you Lord, thank you Lord, thank you Lord. This is a special Grace. It's a Grace

0:15:18.480,0:15:25.040
And the Word given to you today, be a hearer in the name of Jesus. (Amen)

0:15:25.040,0:15:28.940
Be a hearer in the name of Jesus! (Amen)

0:15:28.940,0:15:35.860
Right now open your lips and confess whom you are. Whom you are now.

0:15:35.860,0:15:46.180
I am what God say I am! I can do what God say I can do!

0:15:46.180,0:15:51.800
I have what God say I have. Confess it, that is the platform now

0:15:51.800,0:15:54.600
I am what God say I am!

0:15:54.600,0:15:57.900
I can do what God say I can do.

0:15:57.900,0:16:06.620
I am what God say I am! In Jesus Christ's name! (Amen)

0:16:06.640,0:16:11.200
Can someone tell me , "What is your problem now? You should be able to tell me.

0:16:11.200,0:16:17.860
All these challenges, sickness. Sickness is not a problem. Setback is not a problem.

0:16:17.860,0:16:27.560
Stagnation is not a problem. The problem is; we don't know God who we are praying to.

0:16:27.560,0:16:32.840
If you know me , you talk to me I will answer you. If I can not tell you, I will tell you hold on.

0:16:32.840,0:16:37.340
But this is absent. When we pray , we don't hear from God.

0:16:37.340,0:16:41.580
In the name of Jesus, do it for me , do it for me. Why can't you wait and let God reply?

0:16:41.580,0:16:49.040
We pray and say Amen. So it's two sides - you talk; God talks. You talk, God talks.

0:16:49.040,0:16:55.760
That is God, real God. He talks. God talks. If you are my father - How are you  Sir?

0:16:55.760,0:17:01.320
I am doing fine - How are you doing? - I am ok. That is God

0:17:01.320,0:17:06.100
But in this case today; oh my God, we are the only person who is talking.

0:17:06.100,0:17:14.800
We never hear  from Father, Jesus.

0:17:14.800,0:17:22.000
Open your lips; Make us a channel of faithfulness, a channel of shining light.

0:17:22.000,0:17:29.940
Make us your channel of love. Make us your channel of pardon.

0:17:29.940,0:17:37.520
Make us your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.

0:17:37.520,0:17:44.120
Make us your channel of faithfulness, In Jesus Christ's name.

0:17:44.120,0:17:48.880
You are a channel of God. As you are going now, anywhere you are, you are a channel.

0:17:48.880,0:17:57.720
He has no mouth but your mouth to talk. He has no hands, your hands. He has no feet.

0:17:57.720,0:18:13.780
Say I am a channel of God - channel of love,  pardon,  forgiveness,  faithfulness, obedience. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
