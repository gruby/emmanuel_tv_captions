0:00:00.120,0:00:02.720
Madam, come.

0:00:02.720,0:00:03.460
Yes.

0:00:03.460,0:00:09.200
Prophecy Time

0:00:09.200,0:00:12.300
There is a decision within you that you want to take.

0:00:12.300,0:00:17.140
You are asking God whether you should take this decision or not.

0:00:17.140,0:00:19.340
Very true.

0:00:19.340,0:00:21.820
It's not right.

0:00:21.820,0:00:28.300
Ask God; no matter what happens, God's decision is what matters.

0:00:28.300,0:00:38.680
The situation cannot make you say you want to quit.

0:00:38.680,0:00:41.580
Situation should not make you quit.

0:00:41.580,0:00:46.580
Let God release you; situation should not release you.

0:00:46.580,0:00:47.560
Ok?

0:00:47.560,0:00:54.180
You have taken one leg out; another leg is inside.

0:00:54.180,0:00:56.500
So please...

0:00:56.500,0:00:59.820
Prophecy Time

0:00:59.820,0:01:01.940
I want to see you. Where is your husband?

0:01:01.940,0:01:03.220
He is here.

0:01:03.220,0:01:05.400
Call him.

0:01:05.400,0:01:08.100
Bongani, come.

0:01:08.100,0:01:12.200
Ok, you are the one.

0:01:12.200,0:01:16.260
I hope you are not annoyed that I'm talking to your wife.

0:01:16.260,0:01:17.680
I am not annoyed.

0:01:17.680,0:01:27.600
It is something that only God knows - the secret, hidden things.

0:01:27.600,0:01:32.600
This is an issue that only she thought of.

0:01:32.600,0:01:37.620
It has not been pronounced out but it is a decision from the heart.

0:01:37.620,0:01:44.400
She is tired of the marriage.

0:01:44.400,0:01:47.080
You know the reason she is crying? She never wanted you to know

0:01:47.080,0:01:49.500
because she doesn't want to hurt you.

0:01:49.500,0:01:53.700
The way she is going now, she will shock you.

0:01:53.700,0:01:57.220
Shock you in the sense that you will just find that you are alone.

0:01:57.220,0:02:01.140
So, now, this is God's revelation.

0:02:01.140,0:02:05.940
You just find that you are out, before you come back, the house is empty.

0:02:05.940,0:02:10.660
I've been praying, I wanted to quit but I said that I must first come to The SCOAN, before I go.

0:02:10.660,0:02:13.080
I wanted to quit, Prophet.

0:02:13.080,0:02:19.280
Don't worry, it is not you, it is the spirit; the spirit does not want you to stay.

0:02:19.280,0:02:22.400
You know you have had a lot of disappointments.

0:02:22.400,0:02:22.940
Yes.

0:02:22.940,0:02:25.380
This is not your first attempt.

0:02:25.380,0:02:26.100
Yes.

0:02:26.100,0:02:28.680
You were with a woman before.

0:02:28.680,0:02:29.340
Yes.

0:02:29.340,0:02:33.880
And that one broke and this one too will break.

0:02:33.880,0:02:35.680
Only God can hold it.

0:02:35.680,0:02:39.180
This is not your first woman, you had one before - it broke.

0:02:39.180,0:02:45.280
Now, this is another and herself too has a broken home.

0:02:45.280,0:02:48.300
Very true.

0:02:48.300,0:02:52.620
Prophecy Time

0:02:52.620,0:02:58.440
The problem you people have, the way she quit her former relationship,

0:02:58.440,0:03:00.980
it was not God who released her.

0:03:00.980,0:03:05.400
It was bitterness and disagreement that caused it.

0:03:05.400,0:03:13.180
Yours - you were not released here, she was not released there and the two of you are together.

0:03:13.180,0:03:15.160
This is what is affecting the relationship.

0:03:15.160,0:03:17.060
I will see you, okay?

0:03:17.060,0:03:23.400
There is a medical report about you - you are battling with trouble.

0:03:23.400,0:03:24.740
Yes, Man of God.

0:03:24.740,0:03:28.100
Okay, so I will see you later. Go and wait for me.

0:03:28.100,0:03:31.860

0:03:31.860,0:03:36.300
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:03:36.300,0:03:39.640
So we want to listen to them right now. Madam, you're welcome, in Jesus' name.

0:03:39.640,0:03:43.540
Please introduce yourself to us and also the gentleman beside you.

0:03:43.540,0:03:46.100
Good Morning, Church.

0:03:46.100,0:03:52.160
My name is Mrs Katherine Tetiwa. I am a Zimbabwean residing in South Africa.

0:03:52.160,0:03:58.360
On Saturday during the prophetic service, the man of God called me out.

0:03:58.360,0:04:03.700
I got so relieved because I had been praying for that day, for that moment.

0:04:03.700,0:04:11.500
The man of God said to me, "I can see you want to leave your marriage and you are tired of it".

0:04:11.500,0:04:15.960
The prophecy - it was 100% correct.

0:04:15.960,0:04:19.380
Sorry, Madam, before you go on, who is the gentleman beside you?

0:04:19.380,0:04:21.640
The man  beside me is my husband.

0:04:21.640,0:04:23.680
Okay. Just go ahead, Madam.

0:04:23.680,0:04:28.620
The man of God said to me that I was tired of this marriage.

0:04:28.620,0:04:38.280
He could see one leg being in, one leg being out, meaning that I was still deciding what to do.

0:04:38.280,0:04:45.880
Our problem started three years ago when I got married to my husband.

0:04:45.880,0:04:50.160
But before that, the man of God prophesied to me that this was my third marriage.

0:04:50.160,0:04:55.240
I had two broken marriages before and it was 100% true.

0:04:55.240,0:05:01.040
I broke off my first marriage because of lack of affection.

0:05:01.040,0:05:03.400
My second marriage - it was the same.

0:05:03.400,0:05:06.600
In this third one, it's the same again.

0:05:06.600,0:05:12.580
I want the man of God to help me because I cannot see myself leaving my marriage again.

0:05:12.580,0:05:15.020
I have been praying very hard.

0:05:15.020,0:05:20.420
My prayer was, "God, I know You are going to answer my prayer in a mighty way".

0:05:20.420,0:05:23.600
Okay. So, Madam, we just want to understand clearly.

0:05:23.600,0:05:27.380
You said that this is actually your third marriage. Is that correct?

0:05:27.380,0:05:28.120
Yes.

0:05:28.120,0:05:33.000
Okay. Just describe to us - what were the major problems that caused the breakage

0:05:33.000,0:05:35.920
of your first two marriages?

0:05:35.920,0:05:41.280
The first one - it was bitterness and lack of affection.

0:05:41.280,0:05:44.240
The second one - it was the same.

0:05:44.240,0:05:47.140
In the second one, he didn't chase me out of the house.

0:05:47.140,0:05:50.900
I was the one who packed my bags and left the house.

0:05:50.900,0:05:57.020
So now entering into the third marriage, you said that the same problem continued.

0:05:57.020,0:05:58.660
Could you just describe what the challenges were

0:05:58.660,0:06:01.840
that you were having in your house with your current husband?

0:06:01.840,0:06:05.320
At first, things were going on well.

0:06:05.320,0:06:11.880
Two years ago, we stayed with my husbandÂ´s son.

0:06:11.880,0:06:16.740
But we started to have arguments in the house.

0:06:16.740,0:06:21.840
There were no fights with the son but the atmosphere just changed.

0:06:21.840,0:06:29.120
When he left, we could not fight. If you saw us, you could not tell that we could fight.

0:06:29.120,0:06:36.020
We could talk, we could do everything but he started not giving me money when I asked for money.

0:06:36.020,0:06:42.460
He started telling me I could leave the house. If I wanted, he would never look for me again.

0:06:42.460,0:06:47.200
I said to myself, "There is no way I can still live with this man".

0:06:47.200,0:06:50.800
The affection just disappeared from that time.

0:06:50.800,0:06:54.420
We could spend two months without meeting as husband and wife.

0:06:54.420,0:06:58.800
Okay, so people on the outside would look at you, they would not know there was a problem

0:06:58.800,0:07:02.840
but deep down, in the roots of the marriage, there were serious disagreements,

0:07:02.840,0:07:08.280
no affection and you actually, in your heart, were planning on leaving the marriage. Is that right?

0:07:08.280,0:07:13.060
I didn't even tell him that I wanted to leave but I could hold on his words.

0:07:13.060,0:07:16.160
I could see his behaviour.

0:07:16.160,0:07:19.020
Then I was...

0:07:19.020,0:07:24.160
I didn't know what to do but, deep down in my heart, I was like, "One day, I'll leave this marriage".

0:07:24.160,0:07:31.000
But when I started to watch Emmanuel TV, I was seeing people being delivered.

0:07:31.000,0:07:35.240
I didn't say I was perfect but I was like,

0:07:35.240,0:07:39.020
"Maybe there's something seriously wrong with me because this is the third marriage.

0:07:39.020,0:07:45.240
When I go to The SCOAN, I will get my deliverance and I know things will get to normal".

0:07:45.240,0:07:51.120
When I was sitting there, my prayer was, "If the man of God does not address this,

0:07:51.120,0:07:56.180
after leaving from here, I'm just going to pack my bags and go".

0:07:56.180,0:07:59.860
Okay. So people of God, we can understand the power of that prophetic word.

0:07:59.860,0:08:04.600
This was a decision that she had discussed or disclosed to no one.

0:08:04.600,0:08:08.800
It was in the depths of her heart. Even her husband was not aware.

0:08:08.800,0:08:13.820
But the man of God walked straight up to her and said there was this decision that she wanted to take

0:08:13.820,0:08:17.580
concerning her marriage and we know that as the prophecy has come forth,

0:08:17.580,0:08:20.260
our sister said they have come to seek the face of God.

0:08:20.260,0:08:24.780
We know that the solution from God will also come alongside the prophecy.

0:08:24.780,0:08:29.020
So right now, we would like to hear a word from your husband as well.

0:08:29.020,0:08:32.660
Sir, you're very welcome. Please introduce yourself to us and the lady beside you

0:08:32.660,0:08:38.300
and share your own experiences concerning that prophetic word.

0:08:38.300,0:08:40.940
Good Morning, Church.

0:08:40.940,0:08:44.620
My name is Bongani Mvumi.

0:08:44.620,0:08:48.640
The woman beside me is my wife.

0:08:48.640,0:08:52.440
I'm from South Africa.

0:08:52.440,0:08:59.520
As it was mentioned, this is my second marriage.

0:08:59.520,0:09:05.940
When she was prophesied to, she actually called me beside her

0:09:05.940,0:09:13.880
and the prophet picked up that I married and remarried,

0:09:13.880,0:09:19.280
which meant that I also had a previous marriage.

0:09:19.280,0:09:23.340
So this is actually my second marriage.

0:09:23.340,0:09:30.660
The prophet also said that there have been disappointments in my life.

0:09:30.660,0:09:35.900
He also picked up that I've got a high medical report

0:09:35.900,0:09:42.700
which is very true because I've got high cholesterol.

0:09:42.700,0:09:47.500
I then said to myself, "It is good that the man of God has picked up all those things

0:09:47.500,0:09:52.000
and God is going to address our issues".

0:09:52.000,0:09:54.060
And indeed..

0:09:54.060,0:09:59.400
The problem that started in my family was that -

0:09:59.400,0:10:04.600
specifically when we started staying with my son.

0:10:04.600,0:10:08.880
My wife did not want to accept us staying with my son

0:10:08.880,0:10:14.300
because she had certain suspicions that my son would go back to his mother

0:10:14.300,0:10:21.320
and pick up some things which would be brought into the house and disturb our marriage.

0:10:21.320,0:10:25.800
And because I've got this affection for my children.

0:10:25.800,0:10:32.620
I loved my son and my affection for her started deteriorating. I started becoming very weak,

0:10:32.620,0:10:37.460
and I did not have any affection for her for quite some time.

0:10:37.460,0:10:45.860
And this is why we came here so that God can address our challenges that we are facing.

0:10:45.860,0:10:49.900
So what was the situation in the house before coming to The SCOAN

0:10:49.900,0:10:53.420
in terms of your relationship with your wife?

0:10:53.420,0:11:03.140
Before we came to The SCOAN, the situation was not that tense.

0:11:03.140,0:11:10.520
Like she indicated, we did communicate, we did speak but the affection went down.

0:11:10.520,0:11:16.420
We could just live together but there was no affection.

0:11:16.420,0:11:20.620
So sir, were you surprised when the man of God went straight to your wife

0:11:20.620,0:11:24.620
and told her about this decision that she was planning to take within.

0:11:24.620,0:11:28.560
I mean, did you know anything about this? Were you aware of this?

0:11:28.560,0:11:32.920
As far as that decision is concerned, I was quite surprised.

0:11:32.920,0:11:37.960
I didn't know that she was contemplating to quit the marriage

0:11:37.960,0:11:41.800
because I thought we could still give it another chance.

0:11:41.800,0:11:48.200
And now that we came here to The SCOAN, God is going to answer our prayers

0:11:48.200,0:11:56.440
and He is going to address this marriage to become the marriage that God actually envisages.

0:11:56.440,0:12:01.280
Hallelujah! Once again, this is just an experience in life that we're listening to from the couple here

0:12:01.280,0:12:05.300
and it's a great lesson for our viewers all over the world and those of us present here,

0:12:05.300,0:12:10.000
really demonstrating the recent teaching that the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua has been sharing with us

0:12:10.000,0:12:16.460
about the need for God to release us from relationships, not situations or circumstances

0:12:16.460,0:12:20.660
because if you leave a relationship embittered and offended,

0:12:20.660,0:12:24.140
you will enter the next relationship in the same way.

0:12:24.140,0:12:29.060
And you will see the problems from the first will simply carry over into the next one

0:12:29.060,0:12:31.420
because healing needs to take place.

0:12:31.420,0:12:34.860
And I believe the case of our couple here is a great example of this.

0:12:34.860,0:12:38.080
But we thank God that it was in the house of God that this was revealed.

0:12:38.080,0:12:42.140
And definitely as the prophecy has come forth from Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:12:42.140,0:12:47.020
we know that solution, in the name of Jesus Christ, and divine intervention have also come in.

0:12:47.020,0:12:50.660
Sir, just tell us - since that word of prophecy, how is your body right now?

0:12:50.660,0:12:54.420
How is everything with your life after that prophecy?

0:12:54.420,0:12:59.220
Since I met the man of God, after the prophecy,

0:12:59.220,0:13:09.600
I'm quite feeling better in terms of my body.

0:13:09.600,0:13:14.020
Glory be to God! We know our brother said that he was suffering from health challenges as well

0:13:14.020,0:13:18.540
which the man of God identified in the prophecy and we thank God that he's already seen

0:13:18.540,0:13:23.400
the changes in terms of his physical system and we know that the best is yet to come.

0:13:23.400,0:13:25.600
Now as you're here, sir, can we hear from you?

0:13:25.600,0:13:28.280
What is it that you are seeking from God

0:13:28.280,0:13:33.020
concerning the next step to take in your marital relationship?

0:13:33.020,0:13:39.960
I'm seeking for God to reveal that this is the marriage that I should be in

0:13:39.960,0:13:45.800
so that we conduct ourselves according to God's will.

0:13:45.800,0:13:50.220
Hallelujah!  Well, as we mentioned earlier, we know that God has spoken in this word of prophecy.

0:13:50.220,0:13:54.500
And we know the opinion of God will be revealed concerning this situation.

0:13:54.500,0:13:59.980
Sir, we'd like to finally ask you: What is your word of advice based on your own life experience

0:13:59.980,0:14:02.640
as someone who has passed through this broken home

0:14:02.640,0:14:05.880
and now seen similar problems emerge in your current relationship?

0:14:05.880,0:14:07.980
What do you want to advise our viewers all over the world

0:14:07.980,0:14:13.100
about this area of marriage and relationships based on your own personal experiences

0:14:13.100,0:14:17.760
and that word of prophecy that you received last week?

0:14:17.760,0:14:22.900
My advice to viewers all over the world and in this church is that

0:14:22.900,0:14:28.820
no one can address the problems that we are facing. It's only God.

0:14:28.820,0:14:36.820
Let's all run to God. He is the only person who has got the answers.  With God, nothing is imposible.

0:14:36.820,0:14:40.840
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:14:40.840,0:14:46.760
Madam, we'd like to hear your own side as well, based on your own life experience,

0:14:46.760,0:14:49.140
and we thank God that you are here today in the arena of liberty.

0:14:49.140,0:14:51.240
God has touched your situation.

0:14:51.240,0:14:57.960
What is your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world concerning this very sensitive issue?

0:14:57.960,0:15:05.340
My advice is that in every situation, we must run to God.

0:15:05.340,0:15:09.880
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:09.880,0:15:13.860
So we've heard it from this couple. We know they've come to hear the opinion of God

0:15:13.860,0:15:18.060
and we believe that very soon you will see this couple back here to share their testimony

0:15:18.060,0:15:22.900
of what Jesus Christ has revealed and the next step they've taken in the light of that.

0:15:22.900,0:15:27.940
So we will rest the case for here, knowing that we are going to hear from them very soon

0:15:27.940,0:15:31.440
to the glory of God about what Jesus has done in their marital lives

0:15:31.440,0:15:35.100
through coming to The SCOAN and receiving that word of prophecy

0:15:35.100,0:15:39.320
We just want to encourage both of you to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives

0:15:39.320,0:15:43.000
and we know as you do that, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.

0:15:43.000,0:15:44.120
Amen.
