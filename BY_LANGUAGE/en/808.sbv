Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:00:10.140,0:00:11.560
Stand up!

0:00:11.560,0:00:13.020
What was the problem you had before?

0:00:13.020,0:00:15.800
A very serious ulcer pain here.

0:00:15.800,0:00:17.340
So, as you were preaching there, I said,

0:00:17.340,0:00:20.620
"If you are a man of God, when you touch me and this pain goes, I will know".

0:00:20.620,0:00:26.460
As you touched me, I can't feel the pain - for over 20 years.

0:00:26.460,0:00:28.200
You can't see what?

0:00:28.200,0:00:29.680
There's no pain again.

0:00:29.680,0:00:30.820
What kind of pain?

0:00:30.820,0:00:31.920
Ulcer pain.

0:00:31.920,0:00:32.880
For how many years?

0:00:32.880,0:00:34.420
It's more than 22 years.

0:00:34.420,0:00:36.040
But after touching you, what happened?

0:00:36.040,0:00:38.080
I'm not feeling it anymore.

0:00:38.080,0:00:39.480
It's gone!

0:00:39.480,0:00:46.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:46.380,0:00:48.600
Thank You, Jesus!

0:00:48.600,0:00:52.900
I allowed him to talk out of many I have touched.

0:00:52.900,0:00:57.260
I don't just touch you. What will I derive from touching you and you falling down?

0:00:57.260,0:01:00.680
Sometimes when I touch you and you don't fall, I still want to touch you

0:01:00.680,0:01:03.480
until that thing leaves you.

0:01:03.480,0:01:05.280
I know what is leaving you.

0:01:05.280,0:01:07.780
You may not know.

0:01:07.780,0:01:12.560
At least almost four people I touched here - poverty left them.

0:01:12.560,0:01:16.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:16.520,0:01:19.760
But the problem many of you have is that when you are touched like that,

0:01:19.760,0:01:25.740
because you do not advertise your problem, before touching you, you keep to yourself.

0:01:25.740,0:01:33.140
I will never forget who is the light when I come out from where?

0:01:33.140,0:01:35.940
Darkness.

0:01:35.940,0:01:40.500
Now you are coming out of darkness but you keep the light.

0:01:40.500,0:01:42.060
From darkness to light.

0:01:42.060,0:01:44.860
From darkness to light - those problems are darkness.

PROPHECY CONFIRMATION

0:01:49.200,0:01:54.560
My name is Honourable Jones Dangba. I'm from Abuja (Nigeria).

0:01:54.560,0:02:01.360
We were asked to come for interview, to state what was wrong with us.

0:02:01.360,0:02:05.420
Since I didn't have a medical report for ulcer, I didn't include it.

0:02:05.420,0:02:07.520
So at midnight I woke up and said,

0:02:07.520,0:02:10.740
"Well, God, this is the arena of liberty.

0:02:10.740,0:02:14.320
If this is a man of God and I believe he is because that is why I came,

0:02:14.320,0:02:16.300
prove that he is a man of God".

0:02:16.300,0:02:19.700
He came behind me and touched me. I said, "This is it!"

0:02:19.700,0:02:22.700
Immediately I stood up, he just took his hand and hit directly.

0:02:22.700,0:02:26.160
You can't touch the spot with your finger.

0:02:26.160,0:02:29.560
He hit the hand directly and I fell down.

0:02:29.560,0:02:33.040
He went round, came back again and hit me again.

0:02:33.040,0:02:37.380
As I touched the stomach, no single pain!

0:02:37.380,0:02:39.820
I had this problem for the last 21 years.

0:02:39.820,0:02:42.480
My father has gone to be with the Lord.

0:02:42.480,0:02:44.620
He had the same ulcer issue.

0:02:44.620,0:02:46.420
My mother has the ulcer issue.

0:02:46.420,0:02:47.940
I had the same ulcer issue, and I said,

0:02:47.940,0:02:50.860
"God, this thing must end with me!"

0:02:50.860,0:02:54.860
Even my little daughter, who is now a youth copper, also has the problem.

0:02:54.860,0:02:58.040
I said, "No, this is generational; it must end with me today!"

0:02:58.040,0:03:00.800
But what surprised me was that I didn't include it

0:03:00.800,0:03:05.220
and I only spoke to God in my heart, "If this is a man of God, let him detect this fault".

0:03:05.220,0:03:07.660
And he hit me there and as I stand here,

0:03:07.660,0:03:10.600
I have never seen this type of healing before, since I was born.

0:03:10.600,0:03:14.040
Totally free! God detected the ulcer! I'm healed!

0:03:14.040,0:03:17.680
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:03:17.680,0:03:21.020
So, you mean to say, sir, that as the prophet was moving around,

0:03:21.020,0:03:23.860
the exact spot where he touched you

0:03:23.860,0:03:28.680
was the exact area you'd had this severe stomach ulcer for over twenty years.

0:03:28.680,0:03:30.700
Yes, exactly 21 years.

0:03:30.700,0:03:33.080
He hit it; he didn't just touch me.

0:03:33.080,0:03:37.040
I want to thank God that this is my own gift for the year!

0:03:37.040,0:03:39.160
I have crossed my bridge. Amen.

0:03:39.160,0:03:40.400
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:03:40.400,0:03:43.200
Sir, just tell us - before coming to The SCOAN,

0:03:43.200,0:03:46.340
what were the kind of pains you were in because of this ulcer

0:03:46.340,0:03:48.780
and how did it affect your life negatively?

0:03:48.780,0:03:51.580
I couldn't eat pepper as such; I couldn't.

0:03:51.580,0:03:56.700
If I ate a particular food, I had to buy medication and take it.

0:03:56.700,0:03:59.600
They know me in a particular pharmacy behind my house.

0:03:59.600,0:04:03.180
I used to say, "Give me anything anti-ulcer".

0:04:03.180,0:04:06.540
When they saw me, the pharmacist would say, "Anything anti-ulcer!"

0:04:06.540,0:04:09.720
So every week, I finished one packet.

0:04:09.720,0:04:11.420
When I ate, I had to take it.

0:04:11.420,0:04:14.880
Otherwise, I would have to complain. I would not sleep well.

0:04:14.880,0:04:17.940
Right now, sir, can you just touch the area where you were having the problem.

0:04:17.940,0:04:22.800
This is the matter now; I'm not feeling it.

0:04:22.800,0:04:25.960
Thank You, Lord Jesus, for healing me!
