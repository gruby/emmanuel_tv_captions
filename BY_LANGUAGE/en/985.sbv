God Is Still Saying Something

0:00:05.380,0:00:12.440
During The SCOAN Live Sunday Service on January 3rd, 2016, Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed

0:00:12.440,0:00:15.920
the mind of God concerning Southern Africa.

0:00:15.920,0:00:18.300
These were his words.

0:00:18.300,0:00:22.820
First of all, Southern Africa, if I may talk to South Africa.

0:00:22.820,0:00:29.400
There will be a little rain at the wrong time which is not good for farming.

0:00:29.400,0:00:35.000
Many farmers will be discouraged.

0:00:35.000,0:00:37.740
That is Southern Africa.

0:00:37.740,0:00:45.340
When I say, "Southern Africa", the whole thing will shoot from South Africa.

0:00:45.340,0:00:47.960
In that vision, I was asking God, "What is the way out?

0:00:47.960,0:00:53.080
What can we do in Southern Africa, majorly in South Africa?"

0:00:53.080,0:01:01.000
The Lord showed me that the government should be encouraged by building dams.

0:01:01.000,0:01:08.440
They should be able to invest in dams and irrigation mechanisms,

0:01:08.440,0:01:11.580
using available water from the sea.

0:01:11.580,0:01:16.920
This will also affect power supply.

0:01:16.920,0:01:20.700
You will see the power supply becoming epileptic.

0:01:20.700,0:01:24.100
As time goes on, it will be very serious.

0:01:24.100,0:01:27.040
Epileptic means, it is today, it is not tomorrow.

0:01:27.040,0:01:29.660
It may be very serious.
