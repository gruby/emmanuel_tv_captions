0:00:00.000,0:00:03.640
Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:00:03.640,0:00:07.540
Let someone say, "I am under His eyes".

0:00:07.540,0:00:17.380
Say, "I am under His eyes; nothing out of God's control can happen to me.

0:00:17.380,0:00:19.080
I am safe!

0:00:19.080,0:00:20.780
Thank You, Jesus!"

0:00:20.780,0:00:23.180
Give thanks to Him once again!

0:00:28.460,0:00:35.180
Brethren, there are two sides to life.

0:00:35.180,0:00:39.720
First, we have the spiritual side -

0:00:39.720,0:00:45.080
the ultimate conclusion where satan was defeated.

0:00:45.080,0:00:51.340
Second, we have the natural side -

0:00:51.340,0:00:58.780
where people try to figure God out with their natural mind.

0:00:58.780,0:01:05.420
When these two dimensions of life are clearly discerned,

0:01:05.420,0:01:16.980
only then will we be able to navigate and negotiate the spiritual war around us.

0:01:16.980,0:01:21.880
We are not fighting flesh and blood;

0:01:21.880,0:01:25.800
we are not fighting people with flesh and blood.

0:01:25.800,0:01:28.980
We are fighting someone without a body.

0:01:28.980,0:01:32.740
We are fighting spirit beings - spirit to spirit.

0:01:32.740,0:01:37.720
The battle is the Lord's.

0:01:37.720,0:01:44.600
The believer who walks in the natural is no match for satan.

0:01:44.600,0:01:49.500
But glory be to God Almighty that victory is ours.

0:01:49.500,0:01:54.020
Let someone say, "Victory is mine".

0:01:54.020,0:02:00.420
The natural man, the man of the intellect, cannot understand

0:02:00.420,0:02:04.860
or receive the things of the Spirit of God.

0:02:04.860,0:02:12.820
That's why the Bible urges every believer today to get their eyes fixed

0:02:12.820,0:02:18.460
not on what is seen but on what is unseen.

0:02:18.460,0:02:27.580
Say, "Neighbour, walk by faith, not by sight".

0:02:27.580,0:02:35.540
A Christian should be careful of what he's looking at

0:02:35.540,0:02:43.920
because what he is looking at can influence his thoughts and his future actions.

0:02:43.920,0:02:46.040
Life is a warfare.

0:02:46.040,0:02:54.200
Life is a battlefield, where only the serious-minded can be victorious.

0:02:54.200,0:03:49.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:49.440,0:03:57.240
Life is a battlefield, where only the serious-minded are victorious.

0:03:57.240,0:04:00.960
Say, "Neighbour, are you ready for the battle?

0:04:00.960,0:04:04.860
Neighbour, get your heart set.

0:04:04.860,0:04:07.240
Get your mind set."

0:04:07.240,0:04:12.540
This leads us to our message this morning: THE BATTLE IN YOUR THOUGHTS.

0:04:12.540,0:04:16.620
Let someone say, "The battle in your thoughts".

0:04:16.620,0:04:21.820
Let me take you to our proof text, the book of 2 Corinthians 10.

0:04:21.820,0:04:25.940
I will start my reading from verse 2.

0:04:25.940,0:04:32.540
"But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence

0:04:32.540,0:04:35.660
by which I intend to be bold against some,

0:04:35.660,0:04:39.520
who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."

0:04:39.520,0:04:41.240
Verse 3.

0:04:41.240,0:04:47.640
"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh."

0:04:47.640,0:04:49.160
Verse 4.

0:04:49.160,0:04:58.320
"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,

0:04:58.320,0:05:06.600
casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,

0:05:06.600,0:05:11.100
bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ..."

0:05:11.100,0:05:20.060
Bringing every thought into captivity of the obedience to Christ.

0:05:20.060,0:05:24.200
The devil is our common enemy

0:05:24.200,0:05:31.380
but he hates our looking at things from God's point of view,

0:05:31.380,0:05:38.520
because he knows that the man who learns to walk in Christ Jesus,

0:05:38.520,0:05:43.200
in faith, has satan under his feet.

0:05:43.200,0:05:47.920
That is why he does not want any believer to walk in faith

0:05:47.920,0:05:54.160
but rather he wants them to walk by sight.

0:05:54.160,0:05:59.300
The battle we face in our daily living is with our senses -

0:05:59.300,0:06:05.960
what you see, what you hear and what your circumstances look like.

0:06:05.960,0:06:12.640
Our senses point us to the physical world, to the natural world,

0:06:12.640,0:06:20.260
whereas the Bible says the believer does not have strength as long as he operates in the natural.

0:06:20.260,0:06:27.860
The believer does not have strength as long as he operates,

0:06:27.860,0:06:34.480
he makes decisions in the natural.

0:06:34.480,0:06:42.260
Those who rely on sense knowledge cannot see beyond now.

0:06:42.260,0:06:50.820
But those who operate in the spirit are those who rely on revelation truth.

0:06:50.820,0:06:56.340
I mean the mind of God, through the revealing Word of God.

0:06:56.340,0:07:03.200
Say, "Neighbour, we don't walk by sight but by faith.

0:07:03.200,0:07:09.140
Walk by faith, not by sight".

0:07:09.140,0:07:15.180
Let me give you an example: In the Book of Matthew 16, it is all about Simon Peter.

0:07:15.180,0:07:20.120
Matthew chapter 16 from verse 15.

0:07:20.120,0:07:25.540
Jesus asked, "Who do people say I am?"

0:07:25.540,0:07:29.420
Simon said, "One of the prophets".

0:07:29.420,0:07:40.400
But Jesus looked around his disciples and asked them, "You, who do you say I am?"

0:07:40.400,0:07:42.620
Verse 16.

0:07:42.620,0:07:47.880
Simon Peter listened to his divine nature;

0:07:47.880,0:07:53.560
I mean, he listened to the testimony of his heart and

0:07:53.560,0:08:00.520
upon hearing the revealing Word of God, he confessed Christ as the Son of the Living God

0:08:00.520,0:08:08.320
and received approval and blessing from Jesus.

0:08:08.320,0:08:17.740
But in the other moment in verse 23, when Jesus predicted His death at the Cross

0:08:17.740,0:08:21.860
for the salvation of our souls, to fulfill the Scripture,

0:08:21.860,0:08:32.900
the same Simon Peter listened to the feelings of his human nature and stood against the Lord

0:08:32.900,0:08:42.840
and Jesus said, "Get behind me, satan, for you are mindful not of the things of God but of man".

0:08:42.840,0:08:48.200
What does this mean to you and me?

0:08:48.200,0:08:56.180
Looking at life, its storms and adversities from the natural or human point of view

0:08:56.180,0:09:03.700
is a trap of the enemy to derail you from your natural focus.

0:09:03.700,0:09:12.900
Say, "Neighbour, looking at life, its storms, its troubles and its adversities

0:09:12.900,0:09:27.340
from the human point of view is a trap of the enemy to derail you from your focus.

0:09:27.340,0:10:24.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:24.600,0:10:30.180
Say, "Neighbour, watch and pray".

0:10:30.180,0:10:35.460
Man's conscience is God's instrument for discernment.

0:10:35.460,0:10:47.780
My heart, my conscience is God's instrument for discernment - therefore, watch!

0:10:47.780,0:10:52.160
Our heart is the watchman.

0:10:52.160,0:10:55.820
Your heart is the watchman.

0:10:55.820,0:11:04.340
Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "I do not see satan in the natural; I see him in the spiritual realm".

0:11:04.340,0:11:12.920
Therefore, if your heart sleeps, the devil takes the opportunity to attack.

0:11:12.920,0:11:33.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:33.440,0:11:35.340
What makes your heart sleep? Ask your neighbour.

0:11:35.340,0:11:40.780
"Neighbour, what makes your heart sleep?"

0:11:40.780,0:11:49.460
Negative thoughts, anger, offence, fits of rage.

0:11:49.460,0:11:57.160
These are the things that make your heart sleep because they damage the heart.

0:11:57.160,0:12:02.300
Say, "Neighbour, discipline your heart".

0:12:02.300,0:12:07.200
Say, "Neighbour, take care of your heart.

0:12:07.200,0:12:10.200
Watch over your heart".

0:12:10.200,0:12:12.260
Why?

0:12:12.260,0:12:18.840
Our heart is the realm of desires and emotions.

0:12:18.840,0:12:28.540
Vain and idle thoughts are products of a vain and idle heart.

0:12:28.540,0:12:33.960
Vain and idle thoughts and words are products of a vain and idle heart;

0:12:33.960,0:12:39.480
therefore, discipline your heart.

0:12:39.480,0:12:44.800
Because only dedication and discipline are the fruit of victory

0:12:44.800,0:12:49.640
to overcome the battle of thoughts raging within you.

0:12:49.640,0:12:56.240
Dedication and discipline are the means of victory

0:12:56.240,0:13:01.560
against the battle of thoughts going on inside of you.

0:13:01.560,0:13:07.260
Therefore, capture your thoughts for the glory of God.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:33.620,0:13:36.340
How do we discipline our heart?

0:13:36.340,0:13:41.440
As you are sitting down, many thoughts are going on.

0:13:41.440,0:13:44.400
You are here because you face a giant.

0:13:44.400,0:13:50.480
You are here saying, "When will I separate myself from this woman?"

0:13:50.480,0:13:53.880
Shall I divorce her? Shall I leave?

0:13:53.880,0:13:57.580
Shall I close this business? Shall I have another one?"

0:13:57.580,0:14:03.200
Many thoughts are going on in our hearts today.

0:14:03.200,0:14:07.400
Discipline your heart.

0:14:07.400,0:14:09.540
How do we discipline our heart?

0:14:09.540,0:14:17.860
Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Give your heart a job; don't let your heart give you a job".

0:14:17.860,0:14:28.340
Say, "Neighbour, give your heart a job; don't let your heart give you a job".

0:14:28.340,0:14:37.200
If you don't give an assignment to your heart, your heart will give an assignment to itself.

0:14:37.200,0:14:41.800
Your heart will keep roaming about, taking you to the past,

0:14:41.800,0:14:48.200
from one thought to another and put you into trouble.

0:14:48.200,0:15:09.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:09.440,0:15:18.480
Discipline your heart to become your servant, not your master

0:15:18.480,0:15:24.700
so that you can be able to concentrate on the things that are in the spirit.

0:15:24.700,0:15:29.520
Discipline your heart; discipline your mind.

0:15:29.520,0:15:39.780
Discipline your heart to become your servant not your master so that you can think,

0:15:39.780,0:15:49.460
concentrate on the things of the Spirit because your thoughts have presence.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:04.700,0:16:08.600
What does it mean that your thoughts have presence?

0:16:08.600,0:16:12.140
There are many thoughts going through your heart today.

0:16:12.140,0:16:16.640
That thought will lead you to action.

0:16:16.640,0:16:24.860
That thought can lead you to success or failure because man exercises the will through the mind.

0:16:24.860,0:16:35.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:35.640,0:16:39.880
Say, "Neighbour, your thoughts have presence".

0:16:39.880,0:16:45.940
This means, what happens in your heart will happen in time

0:16:45.940,0:16:53.120
because our life reflects what is in our heart.

0:16:53.120,0:17:03.600
What happens in your heart will happen in time because our life reflects what is in our heart.

0:17:03.600,0:17:11.520
This means our lives will always go to the level of our thoughts

0:17:11.520,0:17:21.540
because our words and our actions express our thoughts, which are the seeds of our lives.

0:17:21.540,0:17:25.700
Your life will always go to the level of your thoughts

0:17:25.700,0:17:32.840
because your words and your actions express your thoughts, which are the seeds of your life.

0:17:32.840,0:17:39.720
A man's life is what his thoughts make it.

0:17:39.720,0:18:08.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:08.580,0:18:17.080
A man's life is what he is thinking all day long.

0:18:17.080,0:18:27.400
What you are thinking about - within you - that is where the unending battle starts.

0:18:27.400,0:18:39.500
It is only by making what is right that can get you to the victory in this unending spiritual warfare.

0:18:39.500,0:18:45.560
It is only by the right choice you make that can take you to victory

0:18:45.560,0:18:52.120
in the face of this endless spiritual warfare.

0:18:52.120,0:18:57.040
It is an unending battle, an unending warfare.

0:18:57.040,0:18:58.480
Why?

0:18:58.480,0:19:06.220
Because we battle with our thoughts throughout our lifetime.

0:19:06.220,0:19:14.380
My heart is the communication point, contact point,

0:19:14.380,0:19:26.800
between God's suggestion to do what is right or the devil's suggestion to do what is wrong.

0:19:26.800,0:19:29.120
Our thoughts have presence.

0:19:29.120,0:19:35.900
Let someone say, "A man's life is what his thoughts make it".

0:19:35.900,0:19:43.060
There will be a constant battle of thoughts in your heart.

0:19:43.060,0:19:47.740
You have to be ready for the battle and face it.

0:19:47.740,0:20:03.800
There are two opposing forces: Right and wrong, faith and doubt, good and evil.

0:20:03.800,0:20:15.240
Say, "Brethren, great thoughts produce great decisions".

0:20:15.240,0:21:07.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:07.520,0:21:15.640
Let someone say, "Victory is mine because I am not alone; the battle is the Lord's.

0:21:15.640,0:21:22.260
Say, "Neighbour, who is your strength?

0:21:22.260,0:21:26.480
The Lord is my strength".

The battle on the outside is only a reflection of the battle on the inside.

0:21:42.920,0:21:49.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:49.600,0:21:51.880
Let me give you an example.

0:21:51.880,0:22:05.040
In the Book of 2 Kings 6:15-16, let's look at the notable biblical hero Prophet Elisha.

0:22:05.040,0:22:08.980
The Bible says, there was a war going on.

0:22:08.980,0:22:14.760
And any time the king of the opposing army was setting up his strategy in his room,

0:22:14.760,0:22:21.320
talking to his generals, all his plan was revealed to Israel.

0:22:21.320,0:22:26.520
They said, "Who is betraying us?"; someone said, "It is the Prophet Elisha

0:22:26.520,0:22:31.920
who is revealing far away the word you are speaking in your bedroom".

0:22:31.920,0:22:36.240
They said, "Let's go and catch him".

0:22:36.240,0:22:41.140
When they woke up in the morning, the town was surrounded by armies.

0:22:41.140,0:22:47.620
The servant of the prophet saw it and got overwhelmed and scared.

0:22:47.620,0:22:54.580
Naturally, Prophet Elisha and his servant were defenceless

0:22:54.580,0:22:59.940
in the face of the heavily armed Syrian army.

0:22:59.940,0:23:07.280
That is why it was not a surprise to see his servant lose balance and emotion

0:23:07.280,0:23:11.940
out of much agitation and fear.

0:23:11.940,0:23:19.520
Because he concentrated, he focused on what the immediate situation was saying,

0:23:19.520,0:23:25.360
not on what God had to say.

0:23:25.360,0:23:34.180
But Elisha, being a man of faith, remained calm, calculated and determined.

0:23:34.180,0:23:35.680
Why?

0:23:35.680,0:23:43.500
Because he was able to see beyond the situation at hand.

0:23:43.500,0:23:49.860
He was able to be calm and determined because he was able to see the other side.

0:23:49.860,0:23:54.440
Let someone say, "See the other side".

0:23:54.440,0:24:00.060
When he saw the spiritual realm, he knew that his God

0:24:00.060,0:24:06.500
had made adequate provision for him to face the enemy

0:24:06.500,0:24:12.300
and God gave him the victory, total victory, absolute victory.

0:24:12.300,0:24:15.740
Let someone say, "God is faithful".

0:24:15.740,0:24:19.540
Encourage your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, fear not".

0:24:19.540,0:24:25.420
No matter your trouble, you are in His presence;

0:24:25.420,0:24:30.460
He is the same yesterday, today and forever.

When the prophet saw his servant was frightened, he said to him,

0:24:44.260,0:24:58.540
"Do not be afraid of the calamities of this world, because fear brings torment, anguish, anxiety".

0:24:58.540,0:25:04.080
Rather than magnifying the cause of your fear, equip yourself with the thoughts of God.

0:25:04.080,0:25:06.620
Let someone say, "The thoughts of God".

0:25:06.620,0:25:11.440
Let someone say, "The mind of Christ; the mind of God".

0:25:11.440,0:25:20.400
You have to know God's opinion over your situation - that's the key, that's the way out.

0:25:20.400,0:25:29.400
Brethren, no matter the war going on inside of you, right now as you're listening to me,

0:25:29.400,0:25:34.740
no matter your giant, we have a Friend -

0:25:34.740,0:25:41.720
the man of God calls Him the Wonderful Unseen Guest - the Holy Spirit,

0:25:41.720,0:25:46.040
who will conquer every giant in your life today.

0:25:46.040,0:25:47.580
Do you believe that?

0:25:47.580,0:25:55.480
Say, "I am not alone!"

0:25:55.480,0:25:59.500
Brethren, if the One who overcomes dwells in you,

0:25:59.500,0:26:04.120
you will overcome every obstacle today, in the name of Jesus!

0:26:04.120,0:26:08.160
Now, what is the lesson of this.

0:26:08.160,0:26:18.580
When you know God's opinion about your situation, life, business, marriage,

0:26:18.580,0:26:25.240
you will fear no more, worry no more, doubt no more

0:26:25.240,0:26:30.480
because that will impart a strength to endure whatever you're going through

0:26:30.480,0:26:35.480
because Someone is aware.

Finally, brethren, faith is the means of victory in this battle of thoughts.

0:28:33.580,0:28:34.980
Why?

0:28:34.980,0:28:42.300
Faith comes when the Word of God prevails over the thinking processes.

0:28:42.300,0:28:53.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:53.880,0:28:57.940
Say, "Neighbour, get ready for the victory!"

0:28:57.940,0:29:02.100
Are you ready for the victory?

0:29:02.100,0:29:03.580
Remember, David wasn't afraid.

0:29:03.580,0:29:05.300
Are you ready for the victory?

0:29:05.300,0:29:08.900
Say, "Victory is mine today".

0:29:08.900,0:29:17.840
Say, "Today, my enemy has made a big mistake

0:29:17.840,0:29:21.440
by allowing me to be here in the presence of the Lord!"

0:29:21.440,0:29:24.160
Today, you are more than a conqueror!

0:29:24.160,0:29:27.700
You will overcome!

Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "There is a difference between meditation and thinking".

0:29:37.520,0:29:42.420
He says meditation has to do with the knowledge of Heaven,

0:29:42.420,0:29:48.260
knowledge of the will of God in your matter, through the revealing Word of God.

0:29:48.260,0:29:57.100
Thinking has to do with the senses, with the problem at hand.

0:29:57.100,0:30:01.100
That's why thinking leads to depression.

0:30:01.100,0:30:03.380
It damages the heart;

0:30:03.380,0:30:10.400
it brings worry and worrying destroys our sense of judgement.

0:30:10.400,0:30:13.480
The Bible says as you meditate on the Word of God,

0:30:13.480,0:30:17.920
you will overcome every negative thought.

0:30:17.920,0:30:23.760
As you meditate on the Word of God, you will overcome every negative thought.

0:30:23.760,0:30:31.020
Those negative thoughts triggered by satan may persist in staying

0:30:31.020,0:30:37.920
but refuse to accommodate those thoughts, refuse to put them into words and they will die unborn.

0:30:37.920,0:30:42.400
The Scriptures say, submit to God and resist the evil one.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:17.920,0:31:22.540
Say, "Neighbour, the way out for you has come.

0:31:22.540,0:31:25.800
The way out for me has come".

0:31:25.800,0:31:33.440
No matter what happens, no matter what comes, speak only the Word of God,

0:31:33.440,0:31:44.060
speak only the Word of faith over your situation, marriage, business, health,

0:31:44.060,0:31:48.100
over every aspect of your life.

0:31:48.100,0:31:53.600
If your heart and mind are filled with the Word of Jesus,

0:31:53.600,0:31:57.560
you will overcome every obstacle in your life,

0:31:57.560,0:32:01.880
you will overcome every trial that comes upon your way!

0:32:01.880,0:32:05.620
And such will be your case today, if you believe.

0:32:05.620,0:32:07.160
Do you believe?

0:32:07.160,0:32:08.540
Do you believe that?

0:32:08.540,0:32:10.540
Begin to rejoice!

0:32:10.540,0:32:15.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:15.720,0:32:25.280
Any moment from now, you will begin to see the name of Jesus Christ working in the Spirit.

0:32:25.280,0:32:34.480
You will see the Living Word of God working in the Spirit - uprooting, tearing down,

0:32:34.480,0:32:39.100
destroying all the strongholds of the devil against your life.

0:32:39.100,0:32:48.040
You will see His power and anointing that breaks the yoke.

0:32:48.040,0:32:51.600
Therefore, take heart.

0:32:51.600,0:32:53.900
Let someone say, "Take heart".

0:32:53.900,0:32:57.620
Jesus cares because Jesus sees.

0:32:57.620,0:33:03.040
He knows you; He knows your past, present and future.

0:33:03.040,0:33:05.040
May God bless His Word.
