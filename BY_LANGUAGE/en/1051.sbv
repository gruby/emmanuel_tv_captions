In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:00:13.840,0:00:17.800
Every knee shall bow!

0:00:17.800,0:00:24.660
Every tongue shall confess!

0:00:24.660,0:00:43.200
You demon, you familiar spirit,

0:00:43.200,0:01:00.000
I command you, in the name of Jesus - out!

Testimony From The Peru Crusade
With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:01:45.300,0:01:47.960
I came here looking for my deliverance.

0:01:47.960,0:01:51.520
Since I was very small, I felt an attraction towards men

0:01:51.520,0:02:01.980
and after some time, when I joined a swimming class, I started dating a man.

0:02:01.980,0:02:07.120
I began to touch him and he began to touch me. We began caressing and hugging each other.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade
With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:02:12.860,0:02:18.020
It didn't allow me to study or concentrate and I would feel disturbed.

0:02:18.020,0:02:24.980
I was in the stands at the crusade when I started to cough and then the evil spirit in me manifested.

0:02:24.980,0:02:28.320
Then, I was carried to where the prophet was.

0:02:28.320,0:02:38.440
During the mass prayer, the evil spirit in me began to manifest.

Testimony From The Peru Crusade
With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2

0:02:41.380,0:02:46.400
I feel much better. I thank God for my deliverance.

0:02:46.400,0:02:48.880
Now, I have peace. I thank God.

0:02:48.880,0:02:53.100
Now, after my deliverance, I no longer have affection for fellow men

0:02:53.100,0:02:55.580
because God has delivered me.

0:02:55.580,0:03:05.800
Now, I am at peace and with God's help, I will do better in my studies and will have a career.

0:03:05.800,0:03:13.020
My advice is to guard your heart, obey all of God's commandments

0:03:13.020,0:03:17.140
and don't open the door to the enemy.

0:03:17.140,0:03:22.400
Thank You, Jesus! Thank You for delivering me!
