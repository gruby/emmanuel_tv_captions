Thank you.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:08.100,0:00:10.180
Thank you.

0:00:10.180,0:00:13.820
You may be seated. 
Thank you.

0:00:13.820,0:00:18.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:18.340,0:00:19.640
Hallelujah.

0:00:19.640,0:00:21.020
(Amen.)

0:00:21.020,0:00:29.320
The foolishness of satan is a strategy to separate the house and destroy the family.

0:00:29.320,0:00:32.380
That will take us to the message today: "Let go offence".

0:00:32.380,0:00:35.760
Let someone say, "Let go offence".

0:00:35.760,0:00:39.060
Viewers at home, thank you.

0:00:39.060,0:00:44.800
I want to greet the Church once again, "Good morning".

0:00:44.800,0:00:51.440
Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, Jesus is there.

0:00:51.440,0:00:56.680
The state of our heart matters; Jesus is there.

0:00:56.680,0:01:00.000
We are there and you are also here.

0:01:00.000,0:01:02.920
The state of your heart matters.

0:01:02.920,0:01:06.240
The state of your heart must be the best.

0:01:06.240,0:01:15.760
We are going to take our message today from the Book of Luke 17.

0:01:15.760,0:01:19.700
The titles there are: sins, faith and duty.

0:01:19.700,0:01:27.500
Don't forget you are a spirit and I want to believe I am talking to a spirit.

0:01:27.500,0:01:34.800
Say, "I am a spirit; I live in a physical body".

0:01:34.800,0:01:39.500
Once you know that, you will not allow this physical body to control you.

0:01:39.500,0:01:45.080
Don't let whatever is outside to control you.

0:01:45.080,0:01:51.120
You allow your spirit to control you because your spirit is controlled by the Holy Spirit.

0:01:51.120,0:01:57.740
Say to yourself again, "I am a spirit, living in a physical body".

0:01:57.740,0:01:59.140
I cannot hear you.

0:01:59.140,0:02:01.940
(I am a spirit, living in a physical body.)

0:02:01.940,0:02:07.380
You are only learning to live in this natural world.

0:02:07.380,0:02:10.640
How to walk, how to talk, how to look...

0:02:10.640,0:02:15.800
You are learning to live in this natural world; you are a spirit.

0:02:15.800,0:02:17.420
Hallelujah.

0:02:17.420,0:02:18.980
So, Luke 17 verse 1:

0:02:18.980,0:02:29.340
"Jesus said to His disciples, 'Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come'."

0:02:29.340,0:02:33.360
That is, it is impossible to avoid it.

0:02:33.360,0:02:46.600
It is just a declaration that it is impossible for you to live in this world without an offence, without being offended.

0:02:46.600,0:02:49.020
It is impossible.

0:02:49.020,0:02:53.840
So, how to handle this offence is the issue now.

0:02:53.840,0:03:00.060
Our response to offence determines our future.

0:03:00.060,0:03:13.360
We are going to look at the strategies satan, the enemy of our souls, uses to trap us,

0:03:13.360,0:03:17.880
get us and connect us to himself.

0:03:17.880,0:03:22.200
Demon's strategy.

0:03:22.200,0:03:28.420
As you listen, I see God touching your heart.

0:03:28.420,0:03:29.780
(Amen.)

0:03:29.780,0:03:35.420
That means you must listen; you have to give me your heart.

0:03:35.420,0:03:40.360
As you listen, I see Lord Jesus...

0:03:40.360,0:03:45.960
This is a vision; this is what I have seen already.

0:03:45.960,0:03:48.940
It has not happened but I have seen it happen.

0:03:48.940,0:03:51.080
You just need to listen now.

0:03:51.080,0:03:56.260
I see the Lord touching your heart, in Jesus Christ's name.

0:03:56.260,0:03:57.460
(Amen.)

0:03:57.460,0:03:59.480
Hallelujah.

0:03:59.480,0:04:01.360
Yes.

0:04:01.360,0:04:11.720
These are the strategies that satan, the enemy of our souls, uses.

0:04:11.720,0:04:24.300
His deceptive and deadly traps for us are hidden.

0:04:24.300,0:04:27.120
They are not open just like that.

0:04:27.120,0:04:32.900
He will not come to you saying he is satan or demon.

0:04:32.900,0:04:45.460
He will come as a friend but it is over to you to examine that friend, to know whether he is friend or enemy.

0:04:45.460,0:05:03.480
He always uses something we love, are attracted to, value and appreciate -

0:05:03.480,0:05:13.800
money, women to men, men to women, position, power.

0:05:13.800,0:05:15.740
That is satan.

0:05:15.740,0:05:19.160
He will not just come to you and say, "Hey!"

0:05:19.160,0:05:21.420
He will pretend to be your friend.

0:05:21.420,0:05:35.860
This is why the whole thing at the end will come as a surprise, "Ah, I never thought. Oh my God."

0:05:35.860,0:05:45.140
He comes under cover as an angel of light and peace.

0:05:45.140,0:06:02.300
It takes the spiritual strength and grace of one grounded in the Word of God to separate good from evil.

0:06:02.300,0:06:17.320
Inner my heart
Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart

0:06:17.320,0:06:24.800
It takes the spiritual strength and grace of one grounded in the Word of God

0:06:24.800,0:06:41.060
to identify the traps for what they are, to identify the tricks of satan for what they are.

0:06:41.060,0:06:48.260
If you are not grounded in the Word of God, you cannot just say, "Oh no, you are satan. Get behind me."

0:06:48.260,0:06:57.660
You must be grounded in the Word of God to be able to examine, differentiate and separate.

0:06:57.660,0:07:08.420
He comes under cover like an angel of light and peace.

0:07:08.420,0:07:26.440
Going by Luke 17 and 1 Corinthians 8:1, one of the most common traps used by satan is offence.

0:07:26.440,0:07:32.600
LET GO OFFENCE

0:07:32.600,0:07:36.620
It is impossible to live without being offended.

0:07:36.620,0:07:46.280
Because of that, he now uses that offence to get people.

0:07:46.280,0:07:56.420
For your information, honestly, offence in itself is not deadly.

0:07:56.420,0:08:06.140
Offence in itself is not deadly if we do not harbour it.

0:08:06.140,0:08:08.280
If we do not what?

0:08:08.280,0:08:09.440
(Harbour it.)

0:08:09.440,0:08:11.480
If you do not what?

0:08:11.480,0:08:13.340
(Harbour it.)

0:08:13.340,0:08:16.920
It is not deadly.

0:08:16.920,0:08:31.460
It becomes deadly if we hold or keep it in our hearts.

0:08:31.460,0:08:39.860
If you hold or keep offence in your heart, it becomes deadly.

0:08:39.860,0:08:50.640
When you keep offence in your heart, it produces so much fruit -

0:08:50.640,0:09:07.340
hurt, anger, bitterness, jealousy, outrage, resentment, hatred – just name it.

0:09:07.340,0:09:15.740
When you keep offence in your heart, it produces so much fruit such as hatred, anger,

0:09:15.740,0:09:23.580
unfaithfulness, rudeness, pride and so on and so forth.

0:09:23.580,0:09:38.040
Offence in itself is not deadly if we do not harbour or keep it.

0:09:38.040,0:09:54.340
In Luke 17, Jesus made it abundantly clear that it is impossible to live without being offended.

0:09:54.340,0:09:55.500
What does it mean?

0:09:55.500,0:10:13.240
It means we have to be ready, prepared and strongly armed for offence

0:10:13.240,0:10:25.280
because our response to it determines our future, determines your salvation.

0:10:25.280,0:10:32.080
When you are offended, it means you are not happy.

0:10:32.080,0:10:39.940
"Thank You, Jesus" is a response from a happy heart.

0:10:39.940,0:10:45.860
"Amen" is a response from a happy heart.

0:10:45.860,0:10:51.000
If someone says, "Amen!" and you are not happy - that is not for Jesus.

0:10:51.000,0:10:56.760
If you say, "Thank You, Jesus!" and you are not happy - it means it is not for Jesus.

0:10:56.760,0:11:05.380
If you say, "In Jesus' name!" and you are not happy - you are not talking to Jesus, you are talking to yourself.

0:11:05.380,0:11:10.980
When you are not happy, your spirit is imprisoned.

0:11:10.980,0:11:13.980
Jesus needs a free spirit.

0:11:13.980,0:11:22.940
It is a free spirit that can attract, have access to the Spirit of God.

0:11:22.940,0:11:31.480
When you are not happy, your spirit is imprisoned.

0:11:31.480,0:11:41.180
"Thank You, Jesus" is a response from a happy heart.

0:11:41.180,0:11:56.160
Not being happy can affect your health, your relationship with others and with God -

0:11:56.160,0:12:03.660
whether you are the accused or the accuser.

0:12:03.660,0:12:14.720
The problem is that if we get offended, we hardly realise that we are trapped.

0:12:14.720,0:12:22.160
"No - it is the one that abused me. It is the one that insulted me. I cannot understand that little boy

0:12:22.160,0:12:24.600
insulting me just like that."

0:12:24.600,0:12:36.780
When we get offended, we hardly realise that we are trapped, imprisoned.

0:12:36.780,0:12:42.140
We believe that we are on the right side.

0:12:42.140,0:12:56.480
Whether you are on the right or wrong side, not being happy is not good; it imprisons our spirit.

0:12:56.480,0:13:07.440
The interest of satan is for us to focus on the wrong done to us, "Ha, he slapped me".

0:13:07.440,0:13:24.300
We forget the reality, which is the consequence of that offence – attack, unhappiness, pain.

0:13:24.300,0:13:26.120
That is his interest.

0:13:26.120,0:13:34.160
He wants us to focus on the wrong done to us and forget the reality.

0:13:34.160,0:13:35.680
That is satan.

0:13:35.680,0:13:46.740
He wants to focus on the wrong done to you and forget the reality.

0:13:46.740,0:13:51.880
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."

0:13:51.880,0:13:58.140
It means blessed are those who are happy, who have a free spirit, for they shall see God.

0:13:58.140,0:14:01.760
If you are not happy, you cannot see God.

0:14:01.760,0:14:09.780
Whether you are wrong or right, accuser or accused, if you are not happy, you cannot see God.

0:14:09.780,0:14:17.640
Because you will focus on the wrong done to you and forget the reality.

0:14:17.640,0:14:28.760
Nowadays, we seem to experience so much division among believers, pastors, bishops,

0:14:28.760,0:14:40.560
the congregation, leaders in politics and business.

0:14:40.560,0:14:45.980
This is because there is a lack of real love.

0:14:45.980,0:15:05.540
The reason for this is that offence is so common, rampant.

0:15:05.540,0:15:08.360
Are you with me?

0:15:08.360,0:15:17.860
There is so much division among believers, leaders in politics and business,

0:15:17.860,0:15:24.980
professional gurus and the congregation.

0:15:24.980,0:15:49.480
The reason is offence is so rampant due to lack of real love.

0:15:49.480,0:15:57.500
Tell your neighbour: "Offence is so rampant due to lack of real love".

0:15:57.500,0:16:01.940
There is love but not real love.

0:16:01.940,0:16:09.920
The love we are talking about, the love of Christ, is not the love they play in politics.

0:16:09.920,0:16:23.040
Political parties A, B, and C will not allow the real love of Christ to be among themselves.

0:16:23.040,0:16:33.460
The reason for this is that offence is so common due to lack of real love.

0:16:33.460,0:16:40.540
Real love forgets wrong, so that there will be a future.

0:16:40.540,0:16:49.520
Tell your neighbour, "Real love forgets wrong, so that there will be a future."

0:16:49.520,0:16:54.580
The challenges you are facing today – no love, no future.

0:16:54.580,0:16:57.280
The world - no love, no future.

0:16:57.280,0:17:03.560
See what is happening all over the world - war, attacks.

0:17:03.560,0:17:06.520
No real love, no future.

0:17:06.520,0:17:14.200
In the face of real, genuine love, offence cannot stand.

0:17:14.200,0:17:25.840
Tell your neighbour, "In the face of real, genuine love, offence cannot stand."

0:17:25.840,0:17:32.520
What is offence in the face of real and genuine love?

0:17:32.520,0:17:43.620
For those of you who know the importance of the future, you dare hold offence.

0:17:43.620,0:17:48.240
We don't know the importance of future; you just want to live and enjoy today.

0:17:48.240,0:17:56.000
Each time you are enjoying yourself now, remember what will happen tomorrow.

0:17:56.000,0:17:57.840
Let me advise you:

0:17:57.840,0:18:06.300
it is impossible to establish a healthy relationship

0:18:06.300,0:18:18.520
with a person who has left one relationship bitter and offended.

0:18:18.520,0:18:25.380
When you divorce and marry another person, you will likely divorce again and marry another person -

0:18:25.380,0:18:31.680
unless you look into the root of that divorce - whether it had been settled or not.

0:18:31.680,0:18:42.020
It is impossible to establish a healthy, good, wonderful relationship

0:18:42.020,0:18:54.560
with a person who has left a relationship bitter and offended.

0:18:54.560,0:19:02.500
This is why you keep having broken homes, relationships with your business partners;

0:19:02.500,0:19:04.200
you don't have any genuine friends.

0:19:04.200,0:19:13.480
And you cannot achieve anything alone; you need good, inspired, informed people - but you can't get them.

0:19:13.480,0:19:17.360
If you leave a relationship bitter and offended,

0:19:17.360,0:19:25.900
you will enter the next relationship with that same attitude.

0:19:25.900,0:19:30.860
So, you can see reason why you keep having problems with your business partner.

0:19:30.860,0:19:34.940
Your business partner left previous relationship bitter and offended,

0:19:34.940,0:19:37.920
you too, you left previous relationship bitter and offended;

0:19:37.920,0:19:45.920
and you people come together to have a relationship that cannot work, unless both of you are healed.

0:19:45.920,0:19:54.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:54.660,0:19:58.920
Our offences can hold us in bondage.

0:19:58.920,0:20:00.860
This is it.

0:20:00.860,0:20:04.240
You can see why you are in bondage.

0:20:04.240,0:20:14.700
Because you left a relationship bitter and offended, you can never have any healthy relationship.

0:20:14.700,0:20:22.360
The Bible says, "Peace will enter relationship and we walk out of relationship with joy".

0:20:22.360,0:20:28.260
Situation should not break the relationship, no matter what happened,

0:20:28.260,0:20:36.320
but God that joined the relationship should be the One to separate you people.

0:20:36.320,0:20:42.820
It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship

0:20:42.820,0:20:54.580
with a person who has left a relationship bitter and offended.

0:20:54.580,0:20:59.820
Healthy relationship means good relationship.

0:20:59.820,0:21:05.500
If you are looking for a good relationship, make sure you meet someone

0:21:05.500,0:21:10.180
who did not leave a relationship bitter and offended.

0:21:10.180,0:21:14.920
That is why it is difficult for couples.

0:21:14.920,0:21:23.700
Out of ten marriages six hardly hold.

0:21:23.700,0:21:41.660
If you leave a relationship bitter and offended, go back and do the right thing.

0:21:41.660,0:21:49.660
You can leave a relationship with peace.

0:21:49.660,0:22:05.940
If you leave a relationship bitter and offended, you will enter the next relationship with the same attitude.

0:22:05.940,0:22:09.280
Sometimes, you will see me very quiet.

0:22:09.280,0:22:17.480
All what they've been saying about me for the past thirty years, "I'm this or that" - I will not talk.

0:22:17.480,0:22:19.160
This is the reason.

0:22:19.160,0:22:21.960
I have been very careful.

0:22:21.960,0:22:31.740
You can abuse me, tell all sorts of things about me; I will not talk - I will leave myself for prayer.

0:22:31.740,0:22:39.660

0:22:39.660,0:22:55.280
Someone who is a devil, pain to you today may be a saviour tomorrow.

0:22:55.280,0:22:59.080
You can be whatever you are to me today.

0:22:59.080,0:23:14.100
If you turn to be a devil today, I will look beyond you to see what you may become tomorrow.

0:23:14.100,0:23:19.140
Tomorrow is a mystery.

0:23:19.140,0:23:23.740
Relationships - be careful.

0:23:23.740,0:23:33.680
The person who is your enemy today can be your saviour tomorrow.

0:23:33.680,0:23:44.360
If you continue to use the actions of people today to judge them, you may have problems in the future.

0:23:44.360,0:23:51.460
"The man is very bad. The woman is very bad." - because they are very bad you take action;

0:23:51.460,0:23:55.860
you will likely have problems tomorrow.

0:23:55.860,0:24:05.260
You will receive in a moment what you have been seeking for years the moment you let offence go.

0:24:11.980,0:24:18.940
Whether you are right or wrong, holding a grudge against your neighbour -

0:24:18.940,0:24:21.800
you have already grieved the Holy Spirit -

0:24:21.800,0:24:37.220
because you are a spirit, living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world.

0:24:37.220,0:24:54.100
Say to yourself, "I am a spirit, living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world".

0:24:54.100,0:25:02.040
If you are a spirit, why are you now fighting your brother?

0:25:02.040,0:25:06.480
Our battle is not against flesh and blood.

0:25:06.480,0:25:12.100
Your brother is of blood and flesh.

0:25:12.100,0:25:17.760
You are a spirit and your battle is not against flesh and blood but against sprit-beings.

0:25:17.760,0:25:21.240
Pressure and tension.

0:25:21.240,0:25:26.480
Ask your neighbour, "Why are you fighting your brothers?"

0:25:26.480,0:25:33.540
They are flesh and blood and your battle is not against flesh and blood.

0:25:33.540,0:25:46.200
You are a spirit, living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world.

0:25:46.200,0:25:53.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:53.080,0:25:59.620
You have to let the world know you are a spirit by acting this way,

0:25:59.620,0:26:02.860
by not fighting flesh and blood.

0:26:02.860,0:26:13.480
If your brother says, "I will deal with you", you say to yourself, "I'm a spirit; how can you deal with a spirit?"

0:26:13.480,0:26:19.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:19.140,0:26:21.120
How can you deal with a spirit? 
It is not possible.

0:26:21.120,0:26:24.280
You can't hold or touch the spirit.

0:26:24.280,0:26:27.720
Where will you see and fight the spirit?

0:26:27.720,0:26:31.960
You can only fight the flesh and blood.

0:26:31.960,0:26:42.580
Jesus made abundantly clear that it is impossible to live in this world without being offended.

0:26:42.580,0:26:49.040
Offence will come – don't harbour it.

0:26:49.040,0:26:54.940
Offence in itself is not deadly.

0:26:54.940,0:26:58.160
It will come; don't harbour it.

0:26:58.160,0:27:03.900
It is when you harbour offence and keep it in your heart it produces

0:27:03.900,0:27:16.620
anger, hatred, resentment, outrage and strife.

0:27:16.620,0:27:24.120
Once it produces hurt and anger, you are not happy any longer.

0:27:24.120,0:27:31.800
"Hallelujah" is a response from a happy heart.

0:27:31.800,0:27:41.760
Not being happy can affect your relationship with God, with others and your health.

0:27:41.760,0:27:44.460
Be happy.

0:27:44.460,0:28:02.940
For you to be happy, you must trust God's authority more than man's majority.

0:28:02.940,0:28:06.860
I want to believe you are free now.

0:28:06.860,0:28:08.020
(Amen!)

0:28:08.020,0:28:11.400
- Are you free?
- (Yes!)

0:28:11.400,0:28:15.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:15.840,0:28:22.080
This response actually comes from a happy heart.

0:28:22.080,0:28:26.000
- Are you free?
- (Yes!)

0:28:26.000,0:28:33.160
(I am free!)

0:28:33.160,0:28:35.700
What do you mean by "you are free"?

0:28:35.700,0:28:39.120
I'm free in my heart.

0:28:39.120,0:28:42.540
By the spirit in my heart.

0:28:42.540,0:28:44.180
- By the spirit?
- Yes.

0:28:44.180,0:28:50.320
I want to believe you listen to the voice of your spirit because it is controlled by the Holy Spirit.

0:28:50.320,0:28:55.500
You have to feed your spirit; your spirit is hungry.

0:28:55.500,0:29:00.260
You are always feeding your flesh and you are a spirit.

0:29:00.260,0:29:03.660
Hunger wants to kill your spirit.

0:29:03.660,0:29:10.000
All this food you eat is not for your spirit, it is for your flesh.

0:29:10.000,0:29:15.500
You have to feed your spirit by allowing the Word of God.

0:29:15.500,0:29:21.240
Read the Word of God, meditate in it and keep it in your heart.

0:29:21.240,0:29:28.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:28.060,0:29:36.520
The prophetic word God gave me is that He would touch your heart with this message.

0:29:36.520,0:29:39.880
I can see your heart has been touched.

0:29:39.880,0:29:42.420
(Amen.)

0:29:42.420,0:29:48.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:48.320,0:29:52.820
There are many people you don't want to hear from.

0:29:52.820,0:29:59.880
Give them a phone call; just say, "Hi, I pray with you, I love you."

0:29:59.880,0:30:01.740
That word will go a long way.

0:30:01.740,0:30:14.080
The spiritual strength and grace of one grounded in the Word of God can identify good from evil,

0:30:14.080,0:30:24.020
separate good from evil and identify his traps for what they are.

0:30:24.020,0:30:28.280
You cannot just say, "I'm free".

0:30:28.280,0:30:37.460
Right now, start reconciliation and stop focusing on the wrong they have done to you.

0:30:37.460,0:30:43.960
Satan wants you to focus on the wrong people have done to you.

0:30:43.960,0:30:45.720
People should tell you...

0:30:45.720,0:30:53.540
There are many of us here that keep one, two or three persons in the prison.

0:30:53.540,0:30:55.480
You sentenced them to prison.

0:30:55.480,0:31:01.920
Find time to go to the prison and say you want to see such and such person.

0:31:01.920,0:31:07.940
By the time you enter you say, "You know me. Please, I want to pray with you."

0:31:07.940,0:31:13.640
Begin to think how you can release such person from the prison.

0:31:13.640,0:31:18.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:18.880,0:31:20.880
Are you with me?

0:31:20.880,0:31:22.200
When you leave here...

0:31:22.200,0:31:32.880
There are many persons that are in a prison because they have truly wronged you, they did evil to you.

0:31:32.880,0:31:38.080
Look for their custody and pay them a visit.

0:31:38.080,0:31:46.320
Enter the prison, wait for the person, counsel the person, pray with the person, and tell the person

0:31:46.320,0:31:50.920
that right from this moment you want this person to walk out, so they can release this person.

0:31:50.920,0:31:53.540
Drop the case.

0:31:53.540,0:31:58.900
Those things are not good for your future.

0:31:58.900,0:32:06.340
They Lord says, "I will set a table before you in the presence of the people you have imprisoned."

0:32:06.340,0:32:10.740
If you put them in the prison or kill, destroy them...

0:32:10.740,0:32:15.940
By the time God set a table they will not be there and He promised He would set a table for you

0:32:15.940,0:32:22.540
in the presence of these people that you had put in prison.

0:32:22.540,0:32:28.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:28.800,0:32:36.900
Tell your neighbour, "I will set a table before you in the presence of who?"

0:32:36.900,0:32:48.260
This enemy - you are killing, destroying, sending them to prison because of the position you have

0:32:48.260,0:32:58.860
and the right, the law of your nation, your country, many had been sentenced to death, to prison, killed...

0:32:58.860,0:33:06.880
So, by the time God set that table before you, in the presence of who?

0:33:06.880,0:33:10.640
... people you have killed.

0:33:10.640,0:33:13.320
People you have destroyed.

0:33:13.320,0:33:18.540
That is why this table is being delayed for many of us here.

0:33:18.540,0:33:21.800
By now, many of us would have enjoying this table,

0:33:21.800,0:33:25.760
but when the Lord realised that you had killed, destroyed a lot of your enemies

0:33:25.780,0:33:31.080
or you had sent them to prison - the table is unnecessary.

0:33:31.080,0:33:32.620
Think about that.

0:33:32.620,0:33:41.600
Change the kind of prayer you offer, "Die die die" - don't kill them, let them live

0:33:41.600,0:33:46.540
and see the table the Lord will set before you.

0:33:46.540,0:33:55.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:55.680,0:34:02.700
Take effort and begin to release those who you call an enemy wherever they are;

0:34:02.700,0:34:10.520
in the prison, wherever - meet them, counsel them, leave them.

0:34:10.520,0:34:15.480
Please, it is very important for your future.

0:34:15.480,0:34:21.340
For your future, forgiveness is very important.

0:34:21.340,0:34:25.940
For your future, release of your enemies is very important.

0:34:25.940,0:34:27.840
God bless you.
