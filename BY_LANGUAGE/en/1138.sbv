Oh God who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise

0:02:13.460,0:02:30.500
It’s You who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise

0:02:30.500,0:02:39.600
Who then must be lifted high
If not our Heavenly Father

0:02:39.600,0:02:48.500
Who then must be given all of our praise

0:02:48.500,0:02:57.320
Who then must be lifted high
If not our Heavenly Father

0:02:57.320,0:03:06.380
Who then must be given all of our praise

0:03:06.380,0:03:15.220
Who then must be lifted high
If not our Heavenly Father

0:03:15.220,0:03:24.760
Who then must be given all of our praise

0:03:24.760,0:03:45.760
It’s You who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise

0:03:45.760,0:03:49.680
Good Morning, Church!

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:55.400,0:04:02.380
Tell your neighbour, “Be calm; Jesus is on the throne”.

0:04:02.380,0:04:08.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:08.360,0:04:11.200
Hallelujah!

0:04:11.200,0:04:13.100
Our viewers, thank you.

0:04:13.100,0:04:20.120
Whatever you are using to view us, we salute your faith.

0:04:20.120,0:04:26.400
Hallelujah!

0:04:26.400,0:04:34.940
Last week we talked so much about relationship and challenges for Christians.

0:04:34.940,0:04:37.720
We are going to land today.

0:04:37.720,0:04:40.860
Hallelujah!

0:04:40.860,0:04:44.680
1 Peter, chapter 2.

0:04:44.680,0:04:51.660
We start our reading from the beginning and later we will go to the proof text.

0:04:51.660,0:04:53.860
Hallelujah!

0:04:53.860,0:05:00.080
“Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice

0:05:00.080,0:05:10.800
and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.

0:05:10.800,0:05:25.020
Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,

0:05:25.020,0:05:31.960
now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.”

0:05:31.960,0:05:34.780
Indeed, the Lord is good.

0:05:34.780,0:05:39.900
Hallelujah; let's go to the proof text here - verse 15.

0:05:39.900,0:05:50.580
“For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.

0:05:50.580,0:05:53.520
Live as free people..."

0:05:53.520,0:05:59.820
That is, live and let me live; live and let others live. Think about that.

0:05:59.820,0:06:07.440
"...but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.”

0:06:07.440,0:06:09.380
Hallelujah!

0:06:09.380,0:06:18.920
We title our message: 
RELATIONSHIP UNDER REPAIR.

0:06:18.920,0:06:23.320
This text we read, you will also find it in other books:

0:06:23.320,0:06:26.560
1 Thessalonians 5:15.

0:06:26.560,0:06:34.100
Also when you look at the Book of Matthew 7. You take your reading from verse 12,

0:06:34.100,0:06:44.660
And the book of Romans, which will be the "landing" - Romans 3:10-15.

0:06:44.660,0:06:53.460
Our relationship is under repair of which everyone can agree with me.

0:06:53.460,0:06:56.380
Your relationship - everyone's.

0:06:56.380,0:07:00.360
You agree with me - your relationship is under repair.

0:07:00.360,0:07:04.660
It is not yet repaired completely, but is under repair.

0:07:04.660,0:07:11.080
Just like a vehicle you use,; you discover a fault; you have to give it to the mechanic.

0:07:11.080,0:07:15.560
When you ask, "Where is my vehicle?" - "It is under repair."

0:07:15.560,0:07:18.540
- "Where is my car?"
- "It is under repair."

0:07:18.540,0:07:31.100
We don’t have to look far to find things we do not like in our society.

0:07:31.100,0:07:32.980
Take note of that.

0:07:32.980,0:07:44.600
We don’t have to look far to find things we do not like in our society.

0:07:44.600,0:07:47.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:47.580,0:07:57.120
Look through your immediate surroundings

0:07:57.120,0:08:07.200
and what you may see seems to be frightening.

0:08:07.200,0:08:11.840
Immediate, just look at your back. If not, because you are in the church.

0:08:11.840,0:08:15.140
Out there, at the bus stop, at the market, anywhere -

0:08:15.140,0:08:21.060
if you just stand, looking at your immediate surroundings,

0:08:21.060,0:08:34.320
you will probably see someone, who is ready to kill you if you are not leaving there.

0:08:34.320,0:08:37.720
Very very frightening.

0:08:37.720,0:08:48.700
Economic oppression – poverty everywhere.

0:08:48.700,0:08:55.980
Even if you have money, you cannot move freely again because of people that lack - you will be afraid.

0:08:55.980,0:09:01.960
What you have is not even enough to calm people around you.

0:09:01.960,0:09:06.060
Many of us - we don't live at our home anymore.

0:09:06.060,0:09:08.340
They say, "Are they at home?"

0:09:08.340,0:09:10.180
You call your wife, "Are they at home?"

0:09:10.180,0:09:14.540
"No, I will sleep there."

0:09:14.540,0:09:18.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:18.140,0:09:45.140
Political oppression – injustice and misrule everywhere.

0:09:45.140,0:09:49.200
You will hear some people say, "Will I vote? How will I vote?

0:09:49.200,0:09:52.620
How will I know that my vote will be this, that?"

0:09:52.620,0:10:01.720
Injustice and misrule everywhere, all over the world.

0:10:01.720,0:10:03.240
There is nowhere to run to.

0:10:03.240,0:10:08.980
In the past you could run this way but now it is like there is no way to run to.

0:10:08.980,0:10:22.860
Are you talking of religious oppression – intolerance and violence.

0:10:22.860,0:10:31.320
You just go anywhere and say, "What religion do you belong to? Are you this? Are you a Christian?"

0:10:31.320,0:10:34.940
Everywhere - fear.

0:10:34.940,0:10:41.760
Institutionalised corruption everywhere.

0:10:41.760,0:10:50.420
That is why the Book of 1 Peter 2:15 says that by doing good, you will silence the bad people around you.

0:10:50.420,0:11:02.300
In the face of all this, let us be known as people who are for good, not just against the bad.

0:11:02.300,0:11:06.320
Don't continue being busy talking, "It's not good".

0:11:06.320,0:11:11.080
If it’s not good, what have you done to change the bad you see?

0:11:11.080,0:11:19.060
If care is not taken, people will see you as a complainer.

0:11:19.060,0:11:28.560
Let us be known as people who are for good, not just against bad.

0:11:28.560,0:11:35.580
Because it is temptation; everything - I mean, we Christians today see temptations everywhere.

0:11:35.580,0:11:40.780
Something is there to make you curse, to make you talk.

0:11:40.780,0:11:52.840
Let us be known as people who are for good, not just against the bad in our society.

0:11:52.840,0:12:02.560
A little example can have a big influence.

0:12:02.560,0:12:10.340
You see me; for many years you people have been crucifying me, in the past.

0:12:10.340,0:12:18.920
When you move around many places of worship, you hear, "T.B. Joshua - rebuke him, ban him".

0:12:18.920,0:12:23.480
I was not engaged in, "You - you are not good. Ban him".

0:12:23.480,0:12:26.460
We are not banned, but you keep banning.

0:12:26.460,0:12:33.900
But here, we keep doing what is right, to change the bad we have seen.

0:12:33.900,0:12:39.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:39.340,0:12:51.240
A little example can have a big influence.

0:12:51.240,0:12:57.580
Instead of being against your neighbour

0:12:57.580,0:13:02.020
because of bad behaviour and character,

0:13:02.020,0:13:16.700
we should try to do what is right to help him improve.

0:13:16.700,0:13:25.100
Instead of being against poverty, "See them; what are they doing; they are lazy!",

0:13:25.100,0:13:33.340
you should make a tangible contribution towards the society.

0:13:33.340,0:13:38.580
There are many people in your home, where you are living - their children are not going to school.

0:13:38.580,0:13:43.360
You always see them at home, but your children are going to school.

0:13:43.360,0:13:47.360
You don't need to see their parents, "What are you doing, little boy?"

0:13:47.360,0:13:50.640
"Oh, my mummy cannot pay my school fees, my daddy cannot pay."

0:13:50.640,0:13:57.400
"That is why I always see you around. Can you tell your parents that I want to support you?"

0:13:57.400,0:14:04.380
The child will run to the parents, "Daddy, mummy, this mister said he wanted to pay my school fees".

0:14:04.380,0:14:07.160
"Oh, thank you, sir."

0:14:07.160,0:14:10.220
Instead of saying, "What are these children doing? Look at these stupid children;

0:14:10.220,0:14:12.600
they are not going to school - stupid."

0:14:12.600,0:14:17.280
No!

0:14:17.280,0:14:24.580
When we see something that needs to be improved,

0:14:24.580,0:14:28.980
when we see something that needs to be removed,

0:14:28.980,0:14:33.380
when we see something in our society that needs to be changed,

0:14:33.380,0:14:37.120
when we see something that needs to be adjusted,

0:14:37.120,0:14:57.640
we must recognise our personal responsibility to do something about it.

0:14:57.640,0:15:04.000
"Ah - this is not right. This is how they have been doing that - it is very bad."

0:15:04.000,0:15:10.040
I'm not saying you should not condemn or criticize, but at the same time you should also look at

0:15:10.040,0:15:15.780
how that thing can be improved or changed.

0:15:15.780,0:15:18.780
This is where we are today, all over the world.

0:15:18.780,0:15:29.440
Everybody takes on the side of criticism, criticizing, "Bad, bad! It is not good!",

0:15:29.440,0:15:36.460
but we have never looked at the other side again.

0:15:36.460,0:15:42.020
When we see something that needs to be changed,

0:15:42.020,0:15:44.180
that needs to be adjusted,

0:15:44.180,0:15:46.280
that needs to be removed,

0:15:46.280,0:15:49.660
that needs to be improved in our society,

0:15:49.660,0:15:58.500
we must recognise our personal responsibility to do something about it.

0:15:58.500,0:16:09.380
As Christians, we have to take responsibility for our actions

0:16:09.380,0:16:18.220
because that is the only way we learn.

0:16:18.220,0:16:27.520
You must choose to do the right at all times

0:16:27.520,0:16:35.800
Though it’s contrary to what you really want

0:16:35.800,0:16:45.340
But the Spirit should lead you by and by

0:16:45.340,0:16:56.240
Then what counts is the essence of the true Church

0:16:56.240,0:16:59.320
That is the message to you.

0:16:59.320,0:17:07.500
After leaving the service today, you see many things under the chair - biscuits, whatever, we drop it.

0:17:07.500,0:17:11.580
You just leave it. You say, "Some people are coming to clean the church".

0:17:11.580,0:17:15.460
Which is...

0:17:15.460,0:17:23.080
As Christians, we have to take responsibility for our actions

0:17:23.080,0:17:27.760
because that is the only way we learn

0:17:27.760,0:17:34.540
and if we keep learning, we will improve.

0:17:34.540,0:17:42.800
If we improve, we become more mature in our Christian life

0:17:42.800,0:17:56.420
and in time, we will earn the right to operate on the level we deserve.

0:17:56.420,0:17:59.960
You have not operated on the level you deserve.

0:17:59.960,0:18:03.140
That is why you want to do something, "I don't understand my dream.

0:18:03.140,0:18:05.700
I don't know whether I should do this or not."

0:18:05.700,0:18:10.120
If you are operating on the level you deserve, there will be discernment.

0:18:10.120,0:18:15.260
When you move, there will be a force that will tell you, "Move this way, that way."

0:18:15.260,0:18:20.380
Not that you consult your neighbour to know where to go.

0:18:20.380,0:18:26.600
That is why we can do ten jobs at the same time; you are an architect, engineer, lawyer,

0:18:26.600,0:18:32.080
you are doing a lot of jobs, because you don't know the one that will bring breakthrough,

0:18:32.080,0:18:38.920
because you have not yet operated on the level you deserve.

0:18:38.920,0:18:46.580
You have so many jobs you are doing; you are the contractor, lawyer,

0:18:46.580,0:18:49.780
at the same time you travel to buy and sell.

0:18:49.780,0:18:59.980
You have so many business cards in your pocket; you don't know what to do because of failure.

0:18:59.980,0:19:09.180
Because you have not yet operated on the level you deserve.

0:19:09.180,0:19:15.520
Let me take you to the Book of Romans 3.

0:19:15.520,0:19:18.860
You take your reading from verse 10.

0:19:18.860,0:19:25.540
“As it is written: ‘There is no one righteous, not even one;

0:19:25.540,0:19:28.820
there is no one who understands.’”

0:19:28.820,0:19:36.700
There is no one who is righteous, not even one.

0:19:36.700,0:19:40.840
All have fallen short of the glory of God.

0:19:40.840,0:19:48.600
If that is the case, it means in this life, we are going to make mistakes.

0:19:48.600,0:19:59.080
When we do, as Christians, we must understand that mistakes are correctable.

0:19:59.080,0:20:04.840
We must think about what we did.

0:20:04.840,0:20:08.420
"Ah, yesterday, oh my God..."

0:20:08.420,0:20:19.380
You must think about what you did, reflect and ask yourself:

0:20:19.380,0:20:30.740
Is this the kind of person I want to be – a liar?

0:20:30.740,0:20:41.660
Is this who I am – a killer, a destroyer?

0:20:41.660,0:20:45.420
And so on and so forth.

0:20:45.420,0:20:48.340
Reflect and ask yourself:

0:20:48.340,0:21:01.200
Is this the kind of person I want to be – a liar, a destroyer, a smoker, a drunkard?

0:21:01.200,0:21:03.640
As a Christian?

0:21:03.640,0:21:06.760
Is this who I am?

0:21:06.760,0:21:09.120
Examining our life is a good thing.

0:21:09.120,0:21:10.020
Tell your neighbour.

0:21:10.020,0:21:12.500
[Examining our life is a good thing.]

0:21:12.500,0:21:13.620
I cannot hear you.

0:21:13.620,0:21:16.060
[Examining our life is a good thing.]

0:21:16.060,0:21:21.080
That is the key Jesus has given us.

0:21:21.080,0:21:24.260
Others – they don’t examine their lives.

0:21:24.260,0:21:28.540
That is why they do more of that mistake

0:21:28.540,0:21:35.800
but as true Christians, we examine our lives; it’s a good thing.

0:21:35.800,0:21:59.160
Few things are more dangerous than a person with an unexamined life.

0:21:59.160,0:22:02.900
Tell your neighbour, "Examine your life".

0:22:02.900,0:22:04.100
Again and again.

0:22:04.100,0:22:05.420
Examine your life.

0:22:05.420,0:22:09.780
Yes!

0:22:09.780,0:22:19.640
Is this the kind of person I want to be – a liar, a murderer?

0:22:19.640,0:22:23.580
This or that?

0:22:23.580,0:22:28.020
Is this who I am?

0:22:28.020,0:22:38.440
Let me quickly take you to the short note of Apostle Paul; that is the Book of Philemon 1:8-19.

0:22:38.440,0:22:44.580
That will be your manual to help you strengthen your relationship.

0:22:44.580,0:22:46.420
The question you need to ask yourself:

0:22:46.420,0:22:50.640
Do you easily get along with people

0:22:50.640,0:23:00.620
or are you guilty of the following I am about to mention, concerning the short note to Philemon?

0:23:00.620,0:23:02.220
Ask yourself:

0:23:02.220,0:23:08.740
Do you easily get along with people

0:23:08.740,0:23:17.580
or are you the type criticising instead of praising?

0:23:17.580,0:23:22.340
No matter what you do - you find you are not the one, you criticize.

0:23:22.340,0:23:26.700
There is nothing good to you, to find that you are not the one that did it.

0:23:26.700,0:23:32.060
You are the type that criticises instead of praising.

0:23:32.060,0:23:35.280
Instead of giving a tap, "Good. It's wonderful",

0:23:35.280,0:23:42.180
since you are not the one that did it, "No, this one is not good" - you are this type, are you?

0:23:42.180,0:23:46.840
Criticising instead of praising.

0:23:46.840,0:23:53.920
Using insensitive words.
