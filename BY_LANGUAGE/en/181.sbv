PROPHECY TIME

0:00:05.000,0:00:09.900
Brother, where is your wife?

0:00:09.900,0:00:16.220
Because, it is terrible, the affection is dead.

0:00:16.220,0:00:17.380
Exactly.

0:00:17.380,0:00:21.960
As beautiful as she is - when you people are together in a closet,

0:00:21.960,0:00:24.000
it's like a man to man together.

0:00:24.000,0:00:25.340
Exactly, Man of God.

0:00:25.340,0:00:28.540
You'll just be looking at a beautiful person but you don't have affection again.

0:00:28.540,0:00:29.700
That is it, Man of God.

0:00:29.700,0:00:31.240
This is the problem in the house.

0:00:31.240,0:00:32.720
Exactly, Man of God.

0:00:33.880,0:00:36.300
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:36.800,0:00:41.800
My name is Mr. Nnamdi Edozie. I'm from Anambra State.

0:00:41.800,0:00:44.920
The person here is my wife.

0:00:44.920,0:00:51.140
The prophecy the man of God gave to me was hundred percent true.

0:00:51.140,0:00:56.660
Last Sunday, the man of God came to me and asked me where my wife was.

0:00:56.660,0:00:59.220
And I said that this is my wife.

0:00:59.220,0:01:06.980
He said that there is no affection, that I don't have any affection for her.

0:01:06.980,0:01:10.460
He said that as beautiful as she is, there is no affection.

0:01:10.460,0:01:15.780
And I said, "Yes". Exactly - the prophecy is correct, hundred percent correct.

0:01:15.780,0:01:18.300
There was no affection between me and her.

0:01:18.300,0:01:25.660
In the house, she would fight me, do all sorts of things to me and beat me.

0:01:25.660,0:01:31.520
At times, I would sleep in the toilet  until daybreak. Before I knew it, the day had broken.

0:01:31.520,0:01:36.920
At times, I would leave her when she was pursuing me and

0:01:36.920,0:01:38.240
I would go to another room.

0:01:38.240,0:01:41.880
If you would go where we are living, you'd see all the keys are broken.

0:01:41.880,0:01:45.300
She would break the key there, meet me and start fighting with me.

0:01:45.300,0:01:48.640
I don't want to touch her, I don't want to beat her, because I know she's...

0:01:48.640,0:01:50.260
So she used to beat you?

0:01:50.260,0:01:52.920
She used to beat me.

0:01:52.920,0:01:57.740
I even cook for her, wash her clothes, do all sorts of things because

0:01:57.740,0:02:00.980
when I entered my house, I would see everywhere was scattered.

0:02:00.980,0:02:07.300
I had to be doing things for myself. The two maids we had, she drove them away.

0:02:07.300,0:02:09.200
So it's only me and her that are living there.

0:02:09.200,0:02:13.740
I want to really thank you for your endurance.

0:02:13.740,0:02:19.480
And, assume you beat her back, a day like this would not come.

0:02:19.480,0:02:23.040
Assume you beat her back, you would not be talking today.

0:02:23.040,0:02:26.020
We would not talk of reconciliation today.

0:02:26.020,0:02:28.600
She beat you.

0:02:28.600,0:02:31.660
And each time she beats you, you run?

0:02:31.660,0:02:35.400
Yes, Man of God. I usually ran because I did not want to touch her.

0:02:35.400,0:02:38.500
I knew she was not herself.

0:02:38.500,0:02:44.420
She was just like a husband in the house.

0:02:44.420,0:02:47.540
I found out one thing,

0:02:47.540,0:02:54.040
Whenever I dreamt, I usually saw the spiritual husband in my dreams.

0:02:54.040,0:02:57.260
He always turned me to be a servant.

0:02:57.260,0:03:01.500
I would be cleaning the house, washing his vehicle

0:03:01.500,0:03:04.540
and he would be busy making love with my wife.

0:03:04.540,0:03:11.640
At the end of the day, after everything, I would be the one to ask my wife how everything was

0:03:11.640,0:03:12.980
and if she had enjoyed it.

0:03:12.980,0:03:15.820
And she would tell me that it was very okay. She enjoyed everything.

0:03:15.820,0:03:18.580
Even the man's manhood was very big.

0:03:18.580,0:03:28.260
Thank you. Today is the last day.

0:03:28.260,0:03:36.480
Uncle, this marriage is from God. And, the deliverance will take place.

0:03:36.480,0:03:41.420
You and your wife will be delivered.

0:03:41.420,0:03:45.260
You will now become a man, and your wife will become a woman.

0:03:45.260,0:03:48.420
You said you are the woman, and your wife is the man?

0:03:48.420,0:03:50.320
She is the husband at home

0:03:50.320,0:03:55.420
because I couldn't tell her anything that she would do. No no no, she can't do that.

0:03:55.420,0:04:00.460
The way she would do it - she takes my money and buy things.

0:04:00.460,0:04:03.580
Like today - she was asking me for money to do her hair, saying that

0:04:03.580,0:04:06.020
she would not come to the church without making her hair.

0:04:06.020,0:04:12.640
The last hair do she had was about 13,000 naira.

0:04:12.640,0:04:14.140
Ok, it's alright. It's alright

0:04:14.140,0:04:16.720
My brother, don't worry.

0:04:16.720,0:04:20.480
Don't worry. She will be a mother after the deliverance.

0:04:20.480,0:04:23.860
Don't worry. Everything will be over now.

0:04:23.860,0:04:25.920
She is a mother.

0:04:25.920,0:04:26.860
Yes.

0:04:30.540,0:04:33.800
This happened this morning. We were about to come to the church...

0:04:33.800,0:04:34.740
This morning?

0:04:34.740,0:04:36.180
Yes, Sir.

0:04:36.180,0:04:37.720
We were about to come to the church and

0:04:37.720,0:04:41.420
she said she could not come with her hair to the church. She couldn't do that.

0:04:41.420,0:04:42.720
What happened?

0:04:42.720,0:04:44.180
Accident?

0:04:44.180,0:04:45.520
She seized me.

0:04:45.520,0:04:46.580
She beat you?

0:04:46.580,0:04:48.300
She beat me and tore my dress.

0:04:48.300,0:04:49.220
This morning?

0:04:49.220,0:04:51.420
This morning.

0:04:51.420,0:04:53.100
Ok, it's alright, it's alright.

0:04:53.100,0:04:57.900
Don't show us the rest. Put it inside the bag.

0:04:57.900,0:04:59.500
It's alright.

0:04:59.500,0:05:02.260
I will not allow you to talk.

0:05:02.260,0:05:05.360
I will not allow you to talk. Don't worry.

0:05:05.360,0:05:09.720
I know the worst has happened. This woman - she will be your wife after the deliverance.

0:05:09.720,0:05:15.020
You will see her on her knees, giving you kiss. All what she has done to you...

0:05:15.020,0:05:17.380
You will enjoy this one. She is a good woman.

0:05:17.380,0:05:19.880
She is not the one doing all this.

0:05:19.880,0:05:25.460
The more you say it, the more ...hehehe. I don't want that hehehe.

0:05:25.460,0:05:26.900
No. Don't worry.

0:05:26.900,0:05:29.000
The rest...

0:05:29.000,0:05:31.960
I have many other things to say. There are so many.

0:05:31.960,0:05:34.320
Oh, my God!

0:05:34.320,0:05:40.580
As she is now, please, cameraman, focus on her face.

0:05:40.580,0:05:44.680
This face you see now, there is no kind of makeup...

0:05:44.680,0:05:47.600
Ok, camera, leave the face.

0:05:47.600,0:05:50.480
Ok, go and wait for me.

0:05:50.480,0:05:54.240
Come.

0:05:54.240,0:05:59.120
Is it a crime to put makeup?

0:05:59.120,0:06:04.540
Go and sit down. Put her near the air conditioning. Because makeup needs air conditioning.

0:06:04.540,0:06:07.700
Please, he should sit down. Come.

0:06:07.700,0:06:09.160
Come and sit here.

0:06:33.000,0:06:42.280
The makeup makes her look beautiful.

0:06:42.280,0:06:43.900
Ok, it's alright.

0:06:43.900,0:06:47.080
I want to tell you, this is a marriage from God.

0:06:47.080,0:06:51.240
I will prove it to you people with the power of God,

0:06:51.240,0:06:53.640
the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:06:54.360,0:06:56.600
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:06:56.840,0:07:00.400
Following the instruction of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:07:00.400,0:07:06.120
the husband and wife returned the next day for deliverance during the Monday Live Service.

0:07:06.120,0:07:08.020
Let's see what happened.

0:07:08.020,0:07:10.460
At the Synagogue Church of all Nations,

0:07:10.460,0:07:14.360
God Almighty moves mightily in the midst of the congregation,

0:07:14.360,0:07:20.800
using Wise Man Christopher as a medium to bring healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings.

0:07:20.800,0:07:25.080
Remember, satan comes to kill, steal and destroy.

0:07:25.080,0:07:28.920
But Jesus Christ came that we may have abundant life.

0:07:28.920,0:07:31.520
As Wise Man Christopher touches this lady,

0:07:31.520,0:07:36.040
the evil spirit inside of her immediately reacts to the spirit-filled touch

0:07:36.040,0:07:38.160
and begins to manifest.

0:07:38.160,0:07:42.220
Let's see how she was delivered, in the power of the Holy Ghost.

0:07:42.220,0:07:43.700
Speak out. Who are you?

0:07:43.700,0:07:45.280
Giant.

0:07:45.280,0:07:50.000
What have you done to her?

0:07:50.000,0:07:53.300
What do you mean by that?

0:07:53.300,0:07:56.460
I want to kill her.

0:07:56.460,0:08:00.860
What have you done to her husband and marriage?

0:08:00.860,0:08:09.380
Manifestation of Evil Spirits

0:08:09.380,0:08:11.300
This is trouble for me.

0:08:11.300,0:08:12.700
You are welcome, sir.

0:08:12.700,0:08:14.500
Who is this man to you?

0:08:14.500,0:08:16.000
I don't know.

0:08:16.000,0:08:17.360
You are welcome, sir.

0:08:17.360,0:08:20.480
She is my wife. We came together.

0:08:20.480,0:08:22.640
No, I don't know him.

0:08:22.640,0:08:25.700
What have you done to this marriage?

0:08:25.700,0:08:27.700
She is my wife.

0:08:27.700,0:08:28.840
Who is she to you?

0:08:28.840,0:08:29.840
She is my wife.

0:08:29.840,0:08:31.380
For what?

0:08:31.380,0:08:33.100
I want to kill her.

0:08:33.100,0:08:34.160
Why do you want to kill her?

0:08:34.160,0:08:37.900
I want to kill her and kill that stupid man.

0:08:37.900,0:08:40.960
Why?

0:08:40.960,0:08:44.260
She is for me.

0:08:44.260,0:08:47.180
I love her so much.

0:08:47.180,0:08:49.100
You cannot do anything.

0:08:49.100,0:09:02.880
This man, if not for the love, they would have been dead by now.

0:09:02.880,0:09:03.920
I did it.

0:09:03.920,0:09:05.640
How? What happened?

0:09:05.640,0:09:07.580
What did you plan to do?

0:09:07.580,0:09:14.120
Accident. I want to kill them. It's too much, they are disturbing me.

0:09:14.120,0:09:15.640
I am a giant.

0:09:15.640,0:09:16.920
From where?

0:09:16.920,0:09:19.360
River.

0:09:19.360,0:09:22.840
These are my trucks that have had a series of accidents.

0:09:22.840,0:09:24.960
Even when we were coming, we had a terrible accident.

0:09:24.960,0:09:28.260
We were discharged from the hospital before we came here.

0:09:28.260,0:09:31.100
I was with her in my Jeep and just like that,

0:09:31.100,0:09:34.000
a car crashed into us head on.

0:09:34.000,0:09:35.540
We were unconscious.

0:09:35.540,0:09:39.420
My chest hit the steering wheel and I thought I was dead.

0:09:39.420,0:09:47.220
I knew there was danger. That's why I ran to The SCOAN to find a solution.

0:09:47.220,0:09:48.880
These are my trucks.

0:09:48.880,0:09:53.180
This one crashed into a commissioner's house, and I repaired the house.

0:09:53.180,0:09:56.760
This one killed 14 passengers.

0:09:56.760,0:10:01.080
This one crashed into the deputy commissioner's house and destroyed it.

0:10:01.080,0:10:02.740
I was the one that repaired it.

0:10:02.740,0:10:06.500
There were other ones. Another crashed into a river. It was a fuel tanker.

0:10:06.500,0:10:09.100
They took me to court and I had to pay approximately 2 million naira.

0:10:09.100,0:10:15.300
All the time, there would be accidents with both my personal and business vehicles.

0:10:15.300,0:10:17.400
All of them would have accidents.

0:10:17.400,0:10:23.700
What other evil things have you done?

0:10:23.700,0:10:26.260
Wait, let us have an agreement.

0:10:26.260,0:10:27.500
I don't talk much.

0:10:27.500,0:10:28.940
You are in the presence of God....

0:10:28.940,0:10:29.960
No, let us do it gently.

0:10:29.960,0:10:32.960
...where you cannot hide, speak!

0:10:32.960,0:10:35.280
I am mighty.

0:10:35.280,0:10:36.700
There is no child.

0:10:36.700,0:10:37.880
For what?

0:10:37.880,0:10:38.880
Who caused it?

0:10:38.880,0:10:40.880
I did.

0:10:40.880,0:10:42.380
Why?

0:10:42.380,0:10:44.900
She is my own.

0:10:44.900,0:10:47.720
For what? Why would I leave her?

0:10:47.720,0:10:55.900
Before she married this person, it was not easy.

0:10:55.900,0:11:01.180
I wanted to push her to somebody who would kill her - an occultic man

0:11:01.180,0:11:03.420
who would use her for rituals.

0:11:03.420,0:11:05.040
It was her mother.

0:11:05.040,0:11:16.480
That woman advised this person to take my wife.

0:11:16.480,0:11:20.360
How did you enter this body?

0:11:20.360,0:11:29.040
I entered her when she was in the market.

0:11:29.040,0:11:35.340
She used to be in her mother's shop, doing things and working well.

0:11:35.340,0:11:38.380
For what? Why should she be working well?

0:11:38.380,0:11:43.160
I don't want her to progress. I don't want her to shine.

0:11:43.160,0:11:48.540
That's why I entered her to destroy.

0:11:48.540,0:11:50.140
I will kill this man.

0:11:50.140,0:11:51.700
You cannot kill me.

0:11:51.700,0:11:54.160
Get away from me.

0:11:54.160,0:11:56.460
Right now, you are a stranger. Get out!

0:11:56.460,0:11:58.320
Come out of this body, you demon!

0:11:58.320,0:12:02.360
Move out!

0:12:02.360,0:12:04.880
All over your body, Holy Ghost fire!

0:12:04.880,0:12:08.680
All over your body, fire in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:12:08.680,0:12:10.660
Fire!

0:12:10.660,0:12:12.640
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:12:12.640,0:12:15.920
Every part of your body!

0:12:15.920,0:12:19.540
Thank You, Lord, for her freedom.

0:12:19.540,0:12:21.400
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:12:21.400,0:12:23.660
In Jesus' Name.

0:12:23.660,0:12:29.020
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:12:29.020,0:12:38.560
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:12:38.560,0:12:41.020
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:12:41.020,0:12:43.460
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:12:49.000,0:12:51.280
Thank You, Jesus. Your are set free.

0:12:51.280,0:12:55.060
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:12:55.060,0:12:58.580
How are you, ma?

0:12:58.580,0:13:00.160
How are you?

0:13:00.160,0:13:01.400
I am fine, sir.

0:13:01.400,0:13:03.760
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:13:03.760,0:13:04.620
Come.

0:13:04.620,0:13:07.820
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:13:07.820,0:13:12.440
Can you see this man?

0:13:12.440,0:13:15.300
Baby, I am sorry.

0:13:15.300,0:13:18.760
I have forgiven you.

0:13:18.760,0:13:26.120
Set Free in Jesus' Name

0:13:26.120,0:13:28.000
Who is this man to you?

0:13:28.000,0:13:29.360
He is my husband.

0:13:29.360,0:13:30.200
He's who?

0:13:30.200,0:13:32.220
My husband.

0:13:32.220,0:13:40.520
You can see that the evil spirit being in her that spoke as the giant man,

0:13:40.520,0:13:42.700
has been cast out by Jesus.

0:13:42.700,0:13:49.720
Her past is over, and your past life of setback, accidents and the rest is also over.

0:13:49.720,0:13:54.540
Thank You, Jesus! We are free.

0:13:54.540,0:14:00.180
By the special grace of God, my mentor, Prophet T.B Joshua spoke to you yesterday

0:14:00.180,0:14:04.280
and, for one reason or the other, there was not enough time

0:14:04.280,0:14:06.280
because he was talking to a lot of people.

0:14:06.280,0:14:14.460
Now, you have been given the grace to explain what the demon in the life of your wife

0:14:14.460,0:14:17.400
was doing to you and your career.

0:14:17.400,0:14:20.640
My name is Mr Nnamdi Edozie. I'm from Anambra State.

0:14:20.640,0:14:25.460
I don't know how to start to thank God because what I have seen today

0:14:25.460,0:14:30.580
is what about 21 native doctors couldn't do.

0:14:30.580,0:14:32.820
It has happened here today.

0:14:32.820,0:14:34.980
Before we got married, we dated each other.

0:14:34.980,0:14:41.900
The very day we pronounced the date of our wedding is when everything started.

0:14:41.900,0:14:46.360
She was in the market one day and was rushed to the hospital because she was fainting.

0:14:46.360,0:14:51.400
I thought it was a very minor issue. I called my friend and we went to church.

0:14:51.400,0:14:54.880
When we got to the church, they said that her mother was the cause

0:14:54.880,0:14:59.920
but I said, "No, it cannot be her mother because her mother handed her over to me.

0:14:59.920,0:15:02.040
There is no way that it can be her mother".

0:15:02.040,0:15:06.320
That's how we started. We moved from one church to the other.

0:15:06.320,0:15:08.680
There is no church we have not attended.

0:15:08.680,0:15:13.820
I then thought that this could be something diabolical.

0:15:13.820,0:15:16.840
I then started going from one native doctor to the other.

0:15:16.840,0:15:19.100
Even when I went to native doctors,

0:15:19.100,0:15:23.700
I would ask them where I could find the highest native doctor

0:15:23.700,0:15:26.200
and they would take me to another native doctor.

0:15:26.200,0:15:29.860
That is how I started going everywhere.

0:15:29.860,0:15:33.680
You came yesterday and you were given a prophecy.

0:15:33.680,0:15:36.400
Do you remember what the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, told you?

0:15:36.400,0:15:36.920
Exactly.

0:15:36.920,0:15:41.520
How has your wife's character and attitude been like?

0:15:41.520,0:15:46.500
Her character caused that there was no peace in the house at all.

0:15:46.500,0:15:49.120
She didn't want to see me.

0:15:49.120,0:15:52.520
When I entered the house, she would do all sorts of things, beat me.

0:15:52.520,0:15:53.600
She can't cook.

0:15:53.600,0:15:57.960
For her hair, she would tell me that she wanted to buy a N60,000 wig.

0:15:57.960,0:16:00.600
I would say, "No, how can you buy a N60,000 wig?"

0:16:00.600,0:16:04.880
She would want to spend money recklessly but I would say, "No".

0:16:04.880,0:16:09.760
Whenever she needed that kind of money and I refused, it caused a fight;

0:16:09.760,0:16:11.860
she would fight me.

0:16:11.860,0:16:14.840
If you went into the house, everything would be untidy.

0:16:14.840,0:16:19.180
She couldn't even wash her clothes. I was the one doing the housework.

0:16:19.180,0:16:23.640
I would wash my clothes and hers and even wash her underwear.

0:16:23.640,0:16:26.860
There are so many things...

0:16:26.860,0:16:29.100
If she managed to cook,

0:16:29.100,0:16:32.980
either the salt would be too much or the pepper would be too much.

0:16:32.980,0:16:35.880
So I told her, "Stop cooking, I will do it myself".

0:16:35.880,0:16:38.740
It was going like that.

0:16:38.740,0:16:41.680
Everything started turning upside down.

0:16:41.680,0:16:43.460
I'm into transport business.

0:16:43.460,0:16:49.400
My vehicles started having problems, getting into one accident and another.

0:16:49.400,0:16:51.220
The business was not moving normally.

0:16:51.220,0:16:53.100
I knew there was something behind it.

0:16:53.100,0:16:57.120
Usually in my dreams, I would see this man.

0:16:57.120,0:16:59.660
Even sometimes, I would tell him to come out and let us fight.

0:16:59.660,0:17:02.020
He was a very tall, giant man.

0:17:02.020,0:17:05.600
When we slept, early in the morning, if I looked at her eyes,

0:17:05.600,0:17:10.660
a kind of sparkle would sparkle in my eyes.

0:17:10.660,0:17:17.240
I used to see her spiritual husband in a very big house with a vehicle.

0:17:17.240,0:17:18.960
He turned me into a servant there.

0:17:18.960,0:17:23.180
I used to wash the vehicle and sweep the house.

0:17:23.180,0:17:28.420
The spiritual husband would come and take my wife with pride,

0:17:28.420,0:17:31.380
enter the house and make love with my wife.

0:17:31.380,0:17:34.380
Afterwards, he wouldhug her, laugh and come out.

0:17:34.380,0:17:37.400
Then, I would ask my wife what happened.

0:17:37.400,0:17:40.480
My wife said that the whole thing was sweet, that it was not small

0:17:40.480,0:17:42.440
and that she enjoyed everything.

0:17:42.440,0:17:45.200
I was helpless; there was nothing I could do.

0:17:45.200,0:17:46.700
I would have the same dreams.

0:17:46.700,0:17:49.080
The spiritual husband would come to me also in my dreams.

0:17:49.080,0:17:52.800
He told me, "Look, my friend, forget about your manhood;

0:17:52.800,0:17:55.100
I have taken it".

0:17:55.100,0:17:57.660
At daybreak, I thought it was an ordinary dream.

0:17:57.660,0:18:01.900
I found out that my manhood was not working very well.

0:18:01.900,0:18:05.980
That was how life was going.

0:18:05.980,0:18:08.820
At times, she would say that she wanted to die.

0:18:08.820,0:18:11.140
She would take a knife and try to stab herself.

0:18:11.140,0:18:13.700
I would be the one that would stop her.

0:18:13.700,0:18:17.440
I couldn't go anywhere because I believed that one day she would kill herself.

0:18:17.440,0:18:23.200
Even when she was sleeping, I would watch her and every ten minutes, I would wake her.

0:18:23.200,0:18:25.720
After she opened her eyes, I would tell her to continue sleeping.

0:18:25.720,0:18:29.640
That was how I had been keeping vigil over her.

0:18:29.640,0:18:32.500
That's how the whole thing started.

0:18:32.500,0:18:35.400
You can't tell her something and see that she does it. No!

0:18:35.400,0:18:38.460
She would like to command you. She would like to tell you what to do.

0:18:38.460,0:18:42.660
At times I used to ask her, "Are you the one who married me or am I the one that married you?

0:18:42.660,0:18:44.840
She would say that she was the one that owned the house.

0:18:44.840,0:18:48.260
Glory be to God, you came yesterday

0:18:48.260,0:18:51.900
and Prophet T.B. Joshua, my mentor, spoke to you

0:18:51.900,0:18:56.660
and told you exactly what you have explained to us now.

0:18:56.660,0:19:03.720
The grace of God in his life has put an end to this trouble.

0:19:03.720,0:19:08.060
Thank You, Jesus!

0:19:08.060,0:19:10.160
Thank You, Jesus! We are delivered!

0:19:12.020,0:19:15.500
TESTIMONY TIME

0:19:15.640,0:19:22.740
Nothing and no one on this earth except God could have reconciled this marriage

0:19:22.740,0:19:26.500
because the reconciliation demanded deliverance.

0:19:26.500,0:19:30.340
The man is the one kissing, not the woman.

0:19:30.340,0:19:33.800
The man is the one kneeling down, not the woman.

0:19:33.800,0:19:37.260
So, all that we were saying while she was standing,

0:19:37.260,0:19:40.840
she was just looking at me - "What is happening here."

0:19:40.840,0:19:45.420
That day, I said to the whole world, after the deliverance,

0:19:45.420,0:19:51.260
the woman would be the one to be on her knees, taking the responsibility of a woman,

0:19:51.260,0:19:54.580
and the man would also take the responsibility of a man

0:19:54.580,0:19:58.640
and the whole thing would be reconciled. I said it to the whole world.

0:19:58.640,0:20:01.420
So, now I know the whole world is waiting.

0:20:01.420,0:20:04.620
What happened now? That is what we want to hear.

0:20:04.620,0:20:14.960
Secondly, the lesson you have to learn here is that God will not prepare a free woman,

0:20:14.960,0:20:20.780
a woman that is so free from everything for you to marry,

0:20:20.780,0:20:25.080
or a man that is free for you to marry.

0:20:25.080,0:20:28.940
You have to do some adjustments, jobs.

0:20:28.940,0:20:31.660
It is like when you buy a car.

0:20:31.660,0:20:34.580
You can't just take a car and say this is a new car and begin to use it.

0:20:34.580,0:20:38.140
You still have some jobs to do.

0:20:38.140,0:20:42.720
In the life of man, in the life of woman.

0:20:42.720,0:20:49.380
If you know this medically, so you should know this spiritually.

0:20:49.380,0:20:54.280
Medically, when you meet a woman you want to marry, or a woman wants to marry a man,

0:20:54.280,0:20:57.960
the first thing you'll want to know is the medical state of the man

0:20:57.960,0:21:00.480
and the medical state of the woman.

0:21:00.480,0:21:06.440
No matter whether the woman says that she is a pastor or born-again or whatever,

0:21:06.440,0:21:11.960
you need to know the spiritual state of the woman, and

0:21:11.960,0:21:15.800
the woman needs to know the spiritual state of the man.

0:21:15.800,0:21:18.620
But we have failed to do that.

0:21:18.620,0:21:22.440
We only face one side of life.

0:21:22.440,0:21:28.020
We are interested in the medical state of a man before marrying him

0:21:28.020,0:21:31.280
and the medical state of the woman before marrying her.

0:21:31.280,0:21:35.660
That is the only thing that appeals to us in all marriages in the world.

0:21:35.660,0:21:39.000
That is why there is trouble in marriages today.

0:21:39.000,0:21:43.160
If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.

0:21:43.160,0:21:48.820
Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:21:48.820,0:21:53.380
If God is with us, nobody can be against us at all.

0:21:53.380,0:21:55.600
My name is Mr Nnamdi Dozie.

0:21:55.600,0:22:00.660
The person beside me here is my lovely wife.

0:22:00.660,0:22:07.140
I dont know how to say this, how to qualify this.

0:22:07.140,0:22:11.820
I'm short of words for what God has done in my life.

0:22:11.820,0:22:17.700
Let me start from Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:17.700,0:22:21.400
People call him pastor T.B. Joshua,

0:22:21.400,0:22:24.660
other people call him Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:22:24.660,0:22:28.080
That man that you are seeing there is more than a prophet.

0:22:28.080,0:22:35.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:35.200,0:22:40.020
He is God sent.

0:22:40.020,0:22:51.840
God sent him to set the world free,

0:22:51.840,0:23:01.180
to deliver the world and set people out of their bondages.

0:23:01.180,0:23:04.800
He did it in my life.

0:23:04.800,0:23:11.120
I have testified, I have seen and I have conquered.

0:23:11.120,0:23:14.720
I have my reason for saying this.

0:23:14.720,0:23:25.660
My reason is that, something that almost 50 churches could not do,

0:23:25.660,0:23:34.520
almost 21 herbalists could not do, he did it.

0:23:34.520,0:23:37.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:37.260,0:23:44.120
I have gone to many churches, there was nowhere I had not gone to.

0:23:44.120,0:23:50.740
Even at times they would ask me to sow a seed that would provoke God.

0:23:50.740,0:23:55.640
They said that when God was provoked, my problem would be over.

0:23:55.640,0:24:08.100
However, the more I sowed the seed, the more my problem got tougher.

0:24:08.100,0:24:15.760
I then decided that this was not a church issue. Maybe it was a diabolical thing.

0:24:15.760,0:24:21.600
That is how I started going to herbalists.

0:24:21.600,0:24:29.260
There was no herbalist in the east that I had not gone to looking for a solution.

0:24:29.260,0:24:36.940
There was no place I had not gone to searching for a solution.

0:24:36.940,0:24:42.760
It got to the extent that wherever I went, I would be asking people,

0:24:42.760,0:24:49.220
where I could get the highest herbalist that would solve my problem

0:24:49.220,0:24:52.940
and they always took me to them.

0:24:52.940,0:25:03.020
There was even one herbalist that was called a name which meant

0:25:03.020,0:25:08.960
somebody who could solve all problems.

0:25:08.960,0:25:11.320
I went there.

0:25:11.320,0:25:15.980
The herbalist called his oracle, called my name. I didn't tell him my name.

0:25:15.980,0:25:17.720
He called my name and said, "Welcome".

0:25:17.720,0:25:21.000
He told me all my problems.

0:25:21.000,0:25:23.380
He told me there was a solution.

0:25:23.380,0:25:26.940
He charged me a lot of money and I paid.

0:25:26.940,0:25:34.020
Yet, everything remained the same. There was no solution.

0:25:34.020,0:25:40.480
It happened that this oracle started telling me many things

0:25:40.480,0:25:49.640
like there was a woman I befriended who was behind everything.

0:25:49.640,0:25:57.260
I believed because the oracle could call my name and tell me what brought me.

0:25:57.260,0:26:06.560
I had every confidence in this oracle and I started chasing shadows.

0:26:06.560,0:26:12.840
Everything this oracle said, I did it - bring such and such amount of money.

0:26:12.840,0:26:21.740
To the extent that I deposited my vehicle in an attempt to pay the balance.

0:26:21.740,0:26:28.160
Still, the problem remained the same.

0:26:28.160,0:26:41.760
It is by the grace of God that I got the cable and searched for Emmanuel TV.

0:26:41.760,0:26:46.940
That is how I saw what is happening here.

0:26:46.940,0:26:53.460
When I saw what was happening here, I started to imagine that I should come.

0:26:53.460,0:26:58.280
When I was coming here, I was coming to test.

0:26:58.280,0:27:01.500
I was coming to test whether it would work out.

0:27:01.500,0:27:04.500
There is no place I had not gone to.

0:27:04.500,0:27:09.080
There was something that happened that I want to narrate.

0:27:09.080,0:27:12.200
During the prophecy, we were sitting on our seats.

0:27:12.200,0:27:17.820
The man of God came and prophesied to somebody who was behind my wife

0:27:17.820,0:27:21.760
and then prophesied to somebody who was behind me.

0:27:21.760,0:27:25.460
He even prophesied to somebody in front of me.

0:27:25.460,0:27:28.000
He also prophesied to somebody behind me.

0:27:28.000,0:27:34.040
When you are prophesied to, the ushers always take you out.

0:27:34.040,0:27:38.800
It happened that I was the only one left on the seat with my wife.

0:27:38.800,0:27:53.080
I told her in slang that it seemed the spiritual husband had covered the man of God's face.

0:27:53.080,0:27:55.700
Praise the Lord!

0:27:55.700,0:27:59.700
Please, take it back again because I could not hear very well.

0:27:59.700,0:28:06.180
You said, when I entered and began to prophesy - start from there.

0:28:06.180,0:28:16.200
When you prophesied to somebody in front of me, behind me and beside my wife.

0:28:16.200,0:28:18.840
It was only my wife left.

0:28:18.840,0:28:25.420
I believed that my problem was more than of those you prophesied to.

0:28:25.420,0:28:28.300
That was when I told my wife that it seemed

0:28:28.300,0:28:33.680
the spiritual husband had covered man of God's eyes so that he could not see us.

0:28:33.680,0:28:37.820
My wife said, "Yes, it seems so. Don't worry.

0:28:37.820,0:28:42.660
When we leave, we will go to that witchdoctor we haven't been to yet".

0:28:42.660,0:28:44.340
Inside the church?

0:28:44.340,0:28:46.220
Yes, that was what we were saying in our minds.

0:28:46.220,0:28:53.180
While we were discussing this, it was as if the man of God heard

0:28:53.180,0:28:58.060
what we were discussing and turned back.

0:28:58.060,0:29:14.240
When he turned back, he passed my seat again, reversed and passed me again.

0:29:14.240,0:29:17.480
You know when you are expecting something from someone,

0:29:17.480,0:29:21.600
you would watch his every movement.

0:29:21.600,0:29:27.340
Then, as he passed, it was as if there was an electric shock that hit him

0:29:27.340,0:29:32.420
and he stopped, turned to me and said, "Brother, can I talk to you?"

0:29:32.420,0:29:36.100
I said to myself that this man must be a powerful man.

0:29:41.500,0:29:45.740
That was when he gave me the prophecy

0:29:45.740,0:29:49.740
and went directly to tell me what was happening in my life.

0:29:49.740,0:29:54.820
My people have a parable that says: Anything you wear on your hand

0:29:54.820,0:29:57.540
you do not need a mirror to look at it.

0:29:57.540,0:30:07.100
As you can see, my wife is a wife to me now.

0:30:10.020,0:30:15.440
This was a woman that did not want to see me.

0:30:15.440,0:30:21.980
This was a woman who, after cooking, she would walk to the dustbin and pour it away.

0:30:21.980,0:30:25.100
Since when? For how many years?

0:30:25.100,0:30:26.840
About two and a half years.

0:30:26.840,0:30:28.560
You people have been living in this trouble?

0:30:28.560,0:30:29.700
Exactly, Man of God.

0:30:29.700,0:30:36.360
This was a woman that would never be happy.

0:30:36.360,0:30:45.500
When she looked in the mirror, she would tell me that she saw another person.

0:30:45.500,0:30:50.680
This was a woman that would tell me something was telling her

0:30:50.680,0:30:56.660
to remove all her clothers and begin to run naked.

0:30:56.660,0:31:05.560
This was a woman that wherever she was, she was not happy.

0:31:05.560,0:31:09.660
She would bring out a knife and want to kill herself.

0:31:09.660,0:31:14.840
I would be the one to take the knife from her. I would be the one guiding her.

0:31:14.840,0:31:19.700
A lot happened in our lives.

0:31:19.700,0:31:31.660
The only thing that has happened now is that she has changed my name to "Baby Boy".

0:31:31.660,0:31:37.560
Before then, she didn't use to call my name: "Who is this? I beg, get out."

0:31:37.560,0:31:41.080
That was how she had been behaving at home.

0:31:41.080,0:31:45.680
But now she always calls out, "Baby boy, where are you?"

0:31:45.680,0:31:54.500
Madam, since that Sunday, what has happened in your vision, your dreams, when you sleep?

0:31:54.500,0:31:57.900
Tell us - what happened, and the man too - what happened?

0:31:57.900,0:32:08.720
After my deliverance, I dreamt and saw the spiritual husband coming to take me

0:32:08.720,0:32:11.280
and use me to make pepper soup.

0:32:11.280,0:32:14.000
Then, they said they have caught him.

0:32:14.000,0:32:21.060
They cut him into pieces and used him to make pepper soup. So, he died.

0:32:21.060,0:32:25.480
In the past, he used to appear to you, sometimes physically when you were alone?

0:32:25.480,0:32:28.620
Yes, before my deliverance, I used to see him.

0:32:28.620,0:32:34.100
When I was alone, it would be as if someone was telling me something.

0:32:34.100,0:32:37.020
If I looked behind me, I would not see anybody.

0:32:37.020,0:32:40.920
It would be as if somebody passed me. I would not see anybody.

0:32:40.920,0:32:44.520
I would always be afraid. I couldn't sleep alone.

0:32:44.520,0:32:46.800
Even in the house, it couldn't be alone there.

0:32:46.800,0:32:51.380
Before my deliverance, I could never be happy - no matter what I had.

0:32:51.380,0:33:01.140
It didn't matter what I ate or where I was taken; it only added to the anger.

0:33:01.140,0:33:06.500
If I was dressing up, I would look in the mirror and I would not be seeing myself.

0:33:06.500,0:33:13.480
It would be as if I was looking at a hundred year old person.

0:33:13.480,0:33:18.660
I would ask my husband if he saw me or saw what I was seeing too.

0:33:18.660,0:33:22.080
He would say it was me, but I would say that I did not see myself.

0:33:22.080,0:33:26.340
The more I said this, the more angry I became.

0:33:26.340,0:33:31.240
There was no affection at all. There was nothing he did that made me happy.

0:33:31.240,0:33:37.000
Even if he did something that would make me happy, that is when I would be more angry.

0:33:37.000,0:33:42.560
But now, I am the happiest woman on earth.

0:33:45.560,0:33:49.680
Wow, did you listen to that? There is affection now?

0:33:49.680,0:33:53.020
Yes, Man of God. I love my husband so much now.

0:33:53.020,0:33:55.040
I learnt you are calling him "baby".

0:33:55.040,0:33:57.500
Yes, he's my "Baby Boy".

0:34:00.660,0:34:02.220
You have listened to that?

0:34:02.220,0:34:04.900
Thank you.

0:34:04.900,0:34:08.380
Oh, this is a lesson to everyone,

0:34:08.380,0:34:13.740
to everyone of us.

0:34:13.740,0:34:19.220
Because of all this, there is marry and re-marry.

0:34:19.220,0:34:25.900
Assume they were able to have a child, they would have a child that is possessed.

0:34:25.900,0:34:29.040
It's better that they have no child.

0:34:29.040,0:34:31.720
Now, they're delivered they can have a child.

0:34:37.480,0:34:45.240
I did not mention the aspect of affection.

0:34:45.240,0:34:52.560
The affection now is wonderful, just like an electric shock.

0:34:52.560,0:35:00.520
We don't want that electric shock to shock you inside the church. So, glory be to God!

0:35:00.520,0:35:04.040
You have spent so much.

0:35:04.040,0:35:14.120
Can you quantify how much you have spent in the process of delivering this lady?

0:35:14.120,0:35:18.200
Man of God, I can't estimate this.

0:35:18.200,0:35:23.440
But in terms of physical cash, I think I have spent more than 15 million naira.

0:35:23.440,0:35:30.660
I am not talking in terms of my trucks and other vehicles that had accidents and spoilt.

0:35:30.660,0:35:33.040
How many vehicles had accidents?

0:35:33.040,0:35:39.060
It was three trucks plus my personal jeep, making four all together.

0:35:39.060,0:35:41.680
Which involved 15 people?

0:35:41.680,0:35:42.580
Yes, Man of God.

0:35:42.580,0:35:43.880
Died.

0:35:43.880,0:35:51.560
My advice to couples all over the world especially people that are passing through so many things,

0:35:51.560,0:35:55.600
they are supposed to learn from my experience

0:35:55.600,0:35:59.220
that there is nothing God cannot do.

0:36:02.040,0:36:10.900
70 percent of homes today are broken because of this spiritual attack.

0:36:10.900,0:36:17.660
When you, because of evil spirit, divorce a woman and end the marriage,

0:36:17.660,0:36:24.700
satan will arrange the most beautiful woman with your desired appearance somewhere -

0:36:24.700,0:36:26.100
waiting for you.

0:36:26.100,0:36:33.020
The next woman you marry will have a greater evil spirit than the one you left.

0:36:33.020,0:36:39.260
You cannot escape it. If you because of evil spirit ... we don't divorce because of evil spirit.

0:36:39.260,0:36:42.080
If you do that, it's dangerous.

0:36:42.080,0:36:45.980
Very dangerous. Are you talking of suicide?

0:36:45.980,0:36:49.120
This is the spirit that makes people commit suicide.

0:36:49.120,0:36:50.720
People like her.

0:36:50.720,0:36:54.540
If this deliverance had not happened at this time,

0:36:54.540,0:37:03.460
she would have hung herself or made use of a drug - sleep and not wake up.

0:37:03.460,0:37:07.260
Hang or stab herself.

0:37:07.260,0:37:10.920
Or jump inside the sea.

0:37:10.920,0:37:15.800
Or run onto the express road.

0:37:15.800,0:37:22.260
That is the spirit of suicide. It would tell you, "Go and do this" and that is it.

0:37:22.260,0:37:27.580
The same spirit in her can affect the husband to do the same, to commit suicide

0:37:27.580,0:37:30.960
because frustration would lead the husband to do that.

0:37:30.960,0:37:35.680
So, can you imagine the suicide that is going on all over the world today? All over.

0:37:35.680,0:37:40.740
You can't because of frustration, commit suicide - but the spirit of frustration.

0:37:40.740,0:37:44.840
You can't because of poverty, commit suicide - the spirit of poverty.

0:37:44.840,0:37:49.900
You can't because of sickness die - the spirit of sickness.

0:37:49.900,0:37:52.420
Are you with me? If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.

0:37:54.080,0:38:00.060
