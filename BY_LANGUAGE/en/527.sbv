0:00:00.000,0:00:03.680
Anywhere you are, let me stretch my hand to the screen.

0:00:03.680,0:00:11.920
I want you to believe - anywhere you are, right now, it's about to happen.

0:00:11.920,0:00:15.860
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:15.860,0:00:30.180
The right hand of God is power.

0:00:30.180,0:00:32.520
Right now place your hand.

0:00:32.520,0:00:35.400
Anywhere - place it.

0:00:35.400,0:00:43.540
Chain of fibroid -  be disconnected!

0:00:43.540,0:00:51.480
Chain of fibroid,

0:00:51.480,0:00:56.720
low sperm count,

0:00:56.720,0:00:59.920
worm,

0:00:59.920,0:01:04.260
tube blockage,

0:01:04.260,0:01:15.140
in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:15.140,0:01:21.860
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:21.860,0:01:33.700
Open your mouth.

0:01:33.700,0:01:37.700
SCOAN Mass Prayer

0:01:37.720,0:01:40.740
Watch the screen and see what is happening.

0:01:40.740,0:01:47.320
More people are vomitting out.

0:01:47.320,0:01:53.000
Just continue to watch the screen and see what is happening live and direct in our midst.

0:01:53.000,0:02:05.000
SCOAN Mass Prayer

0:02:05.000,0:02:07.000
Watch the screen.

0:02:07.000,0:02:09.520
That is another one right there.

0:02:09.520,0:02:11.100
You can see what is coming out of her body.

0:02:11.100,0:02:22.040
Watch the screen, see what is coming out!

0:02:22.040,0:02:26.460
You have three fibroids and two have come out.

0:02:26.460,0:02:29.820
It remains one and it will come out right now.

0:02:29.820,0:02:34.300
Two are out already, one is to go.

0:02:34.300,0:02:41.300
SCOAN Mass Prayer

0:02:41.360,0:02:42.920
Watch the screen.

0:02:42.920,0:02:46.120
Something has fallen into my pants, as the man of God has said.

0:02:46.120,0:02:48.740
Thank you, I am going to the toilet.

0:02:48.740,0:02:50.520
Watch the screen.

0:02:50.520,0:02:53.860
This is happening right now, right here.

0:02:53.860,0:02:57.820
The woman vomitted what has been the tube blockage in her life.

0:02:57.820,0:02:59.980
Watch your screen right now.

0:02:59.980,0:03:03.620
That is the one that dropped in her pants.

0:03:03.620,0:03:05.180
Watch your screen.

0:03:05.180,0:03:08.100
It has come out already, all the fibroids in her system.

0:03:08.100,0:03:10.800
Open your eyes and watch.

0:03:10.800,0:03:24.600
Stretch your hand and say, "Lord, manifest Yourself in my life". Prayer.

0:03:24.600,0:03:35.600
SCOAN Mass Prayer

0:03:35.600,0:03:38.120
Low sperm count,

0:03:38.120,0:03:40.760
tube blockage,

0:03:40.760,0:03:42.540
worm,

0:03:42.540,0:03:45.720
in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:03:45.720,0:03:47.000
Prayer.

0:03:47.000,0:03:48.060
Watch your screen.

0:03:48.060,0:03:53.400
That is fibroid.

0:03:53.400,0:03:57.140
Watch your screen.

0:03:57.140,0:04:01.700
There is a woman passing out her fibroid right there.

0:04:01.700,0:04:29.700
SCOAN Mass Prayer

0:04:29.760,0:04:34.680
Place your hand.

0:04:34.680,0:04:37.400
Keep watching your screen.

0:04:37.400,0:04:47.400
SCOAN Mass Prayer

0:04:47.480,0:04:51.400
Keep watching your screen.

0:04:51.400,0:04:55.320
Here I am with all I have

0:04:55.320,0:04:59.540
I raise my hands to worship You

0:04:59.540,0:05:04.380
I wanna say thank You

0:05:04.380,0:05:09.360
O thank You

0:05:09.360,0:05:13.220
For everything for who You are

0:05:13.240,0:05:17.780
You cover me and touch my heart

0:05:17.780,0:05:22.480
I wanna say thank You

0:05:22.480,0:05:32.000
O thank You

0:05:32.000,0:05:34.840
Give thanks to God.

0:05:34.840,0:05:39.080
Begin to give thanks to God and share your testimony with your neighbour.

0:05:39.080,0:05:47.540
If you must receive, you must learn to plant.

0:05:47.540,0:05:51.900
I told you some weeks ago how to start this.

0:05:51.900,0:05:57.680
Get a carton and make a hole and cello tape it round.

0:05:57.680,0:06:01.080
Every day should be your offering.

0:06:01.080,0:06:03.980
We are not saying you should bring it to the church.

0:06:03.980,0:06:06.740
Every day.

0:06:06.740,0:06:08.380
Do not depend on your salary.

0:06:08.380,0:06:10.900
God does not know anything about your salary.

0:06:10.900,0:06:14.500
He promised to bless you every day.

0:06:14.500,0:06:18.880
If you want to be receiving blessing, mercy and favour,

0:06:18.880,0:06:23.640
every day, have this carton. Put it inside your bedroom.

0:06:23.640,0:06:27.700
As you go out and come in, put something inside this carton -

0:06:27.700,0:06:31.600
something your life depends on.

0:06:31.600,0:06:36.700
Towards the end of the week, anytime you are free,

0:06:36.700,0:06:42.160
take the money; don't count the money. Put it inside an envelope.

0:06:42.160,0:06:48.480
Take it to the fatherless, widows, physically challenged.

0:06:48.480,0:06:52.200
Everything about you is supposed to be new.

0:06:52.200,0:06:56.460
Your destiny needs to be reshaped.

0:06:56.460,0:07:02.480
Giving offers us an opportunity of reshaping our destiny.

0:07:02.480,0:07:12.320
Tell your neighbour, "Giving offers us an opportunity of reshaping our destiny".

0:07:12.320,0:07:17.320
When we say 'giving',

0:07:17.320,0:07:26.280
what you give does not matter, but the way and manner you give it.

0:07:26.280,0:07:30.020
Whatever you want to give must be given cheerfully.

0:07:30.020,0:07:33.360
Cheerfully.

0:07:33.360,0:07:37.840
Before you can give something cheerfully, that thing must be something

0:07:37.840,0:07:43.680
your life depends on - something you need, not something you don't need.

0:07:43.680,0:07:47.020
It's not all the time you give what you don't need.

0:07:47.020,0:07:50.740
Many times, you should give what you need also.

0:07:50.740,0:07:55.220
Something you want, you should be able to give it.

0:07:55.220,0:07:57.700
The problem we are facing is not too far.

0:07:57.700,0:08:03.760
Not that you don't give but you give what you don't need.

0:08:03.760,0:08:09.100
You should be able to give two days in a week out of seven days -

0:08:09.100,0:08:11.080
something you need.

0:08:11.080,0:08:14.940
Ah, I need this thing. I need it.

0:08:14.940,0:08:23.220
Open your warehouse, your garage. Take a new tyre, not a used tyre.

0:08:23.220,0:08:27.420
Can you imagine how many people you have killed in the past

0:08:27.420,0:08:31.420
through your offering; through your unworthy offering.

0:08:31.420,0:08:36.420
You keep giving tyres you don't need - used tyres - and

0:08:36.420,0:08:39.300
these people you're giving - they cherish it.

0:08:39.300,0:08:43.720
They would now use it for a vehicle that is going for a long distance.

0:08:43.720,0:08:48.300
Before they know it, the tyre bursts, and thousands die.

0:08:48.300,0:08:54.960
Can you imagine what your unworthy offering has done?

0:08:54.960,0:09:00.320
Out of seven days in a week, you must be able to give two days -

0:09:00.320,0:09:07.500
something your life depends on - something you need.

0:09:07.500,0:09:12.880
If not, your offering is unworthy.

0:09:12.880,0:09:14.600
I want you to make this decision.

0:09:14.600,0:09:19.560
Let me see your hand up.

0:09:19.560,0:09:20.840
Right now, decision!

0:09:20.840,0:09:22.200
Stretch your hand.

0:09:22.200,0:09:23.640
Stretch it forward.

0:09:23.640,0:09:26.900
As you stretch your hand, you are ready to make a decision.

0:09:26.900,0:09:31.460
Don't wait till you have a box. Get a carton.

0:09:31.460,0:09:35.820
You and your husband, put the money together.

0:09:35.820,0:09:41.020
You housewife, you don't have a job or husband, whatever little you are doing.

0:09:41.020,0:09:45.680
The best time to give is when you don't have.

0:09:45.680,0:09:50.460
When you begin to have so much, you cannot give what your life depends on.

0:09:50.460,0:09:54.540
But when you have little, if you can give out of that little,

0:09:54.540,0:09:55.820
wow!

0:09:55.820,0:10:03.800
Tell your neighbour, "The best time to give is when you don't have".

0:10:03.800,0:10:05.020
So thank you.

0:10:05.020,0:10:08.120
Hallelujah!

0:10:08.120,0:10:13.880
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
