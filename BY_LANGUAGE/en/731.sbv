0:00:00.220,0:00:06.040
There is a lady I met at the emergency here.

0:00:06.040,0:00:10.880
Where is she?

0:00:17.100,0:00:22.240
Come.

0:00:22.240,0:00:25.600
Do you know the reason I brought you out?

0:00:25.600,0:00:37.280
I'm seeing you on a cemetery and you were given something like blood to drink as an initiation.

0:00:37.280,0:00:38.660
Yes, it is true.

0:00:38.660,0:00:42.160
It was in the night.

0:00:42.160,0:00:47.700
You went to the cemetery...

0:00:47.700,0:00:52.220
A brother carried you there, who acted as your boyfriend.

0:00:52.220,0:00:55.120
Yes.

0:00:55.120,0:00:58.420
Since then, your life has not been the same.

0:00:58.420,0:00:59.140
It has never.

0:00:59.140,0:01:08.340
There's nothing since that time – smoking, drinking, cocaine, drugs, whatever - evil things are in your hands.

0:01:08.340,0:01:12.160
Yes man of God, it is true.

0:01:39.220,0:01:47.080
Out!

0:01:47.080,0:01:49.740
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:49.740,0:01:57.960
The spirit of killing, stealing, destruction – out!

0:02:03.120,0:02:12.080
She was carried to a cemetery and given blood.

0:02:12.080,0:02:22.640
She drank the blood as an initiation into a society.

0:02:22.640,0:02:29.920
Since then every evil thing you can talk of...

0:02:37.840,0:02:44.460
Out!

0:02:49.540,0:02:52.840
Stand up.

0:02:58.180,0:02:59.900
Do you see?

0:02:59.900,0:03:02.400
I'm feeling what is inside her.

0:03:02.400,0:03:07.240
Can you see?

0:03:11.160,0:03:18.180
If I remove my hand now she will get over.

0:03:18.180,0:03:20.560
What's your name?

0:03:20.560,0:03:21.560
Tricia.

0:03:21.560,0:03:36.220
Now, she has been delivered, she has no fear but the fear of God.

0:03:36.220,0:03:38.120
Where were you carried to?

0:03:38.120,0:03:40.540
I was carried to a cemetery.

0:03:40.540,0:03:43.460
OK and there you drank what?

0:03:43.460,0:03:46.060
I was given blood in a bowl.

0:03:46.060,0:03:49.500
Shout the name, "Jesus".

0:03:49.500,0:03:54.260
Jesus!

0:03:54.260,0:03:57.680
Down she goes.

0:03:57.680,0:04:01.540
There is mighty power in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:04:01.540,0:04:03.280
She is free!

0:04:03.280,0:04:06.560
Glory be to God in the highest.

0:04:11.720,0:04:15.640
Prophecy confirmation.

0:04:15.640,0:04:21.040
My name is Tricia. 
I am from Botswana.

0:04:21.040,0:04:26.200
Tell us what was the message of prophecy you received from the man of God today.

0:04:26.200,0:04:30.900
This is my first visit to The SCOAN.

0:04:30.900,0:04:35.600
Prophet T.B. Joshua came into the crowd and pulled me out.

0:04:35.600,0:04:50.860
He said he saw a graveyard and a bowl and that this young lady was taking blood from the bowl

0:04:50.860,0:05:05.060
as an initiation into satanism and that she was initiated by her boyfriend.

0:05:05.060,0:05:13.080
The man of God said that since then, nothing in my life has ever been the same;

0:05:13.080,0:05:19.440
He said I stared drinking, smoking, taking drugs, sleeping around with men

0:05:19.440,0:05:32.380
and that is true because I remember three and a half years back, I had my boyfriend

0:05:32.380,0:05:35.700
and he initiated me into satanism.

0:05:35.700,0:05:44.960
One night, he took me out, we went drinking and taking drugs and he said we were taking a drug with some

0:05:44.960,0:05:48.980
of his other friends and relatives.

0:05:48.980,0:05:52.220
We took a drive to a cemetery.

0:05:52.220,0:06:03.180
When we got there they started singing weird songs and praying in so many ways.

0:06:03.180,0:06:06.460
There were a lot of people there.

0:06:06.460,0:06:15.160
As it was happening that night, I remember I was marked with some black stuff and covered

0:06:15.160,0:06:18.480
in a black cloth.

0:06:18.480,0:06:22.900
They surrounded me and started praying again.

0:06:22.900,0:06:29.640
As they were praying, a bowl of blood was being passed round and everybody who was there

0:06:29.640,0:06:31.000
was drinking blood.

0:06:31.000,0:06:36.840
As they were passing the bowl of the blood round among themselves,

0:06:36.840,0:06:41.340
you were also given this bowl, like the man of God said - is that right?

0:06:41.340,0:06:43.020
Yes, that is right.

0:06:43.020,0:06:44.060
Did you drink it?

0:06:44.060,0:06:45.320
I drank it.

0:06:45.320,0:06:57.080
I'm seeing you on a cemetery and you were given something like blood to drink as an initiation.

0:06:57.080,0:06:58.440
Yes, it it true.

0:06:58.440,0:07:02.200
It was in the night.

0:07:02.200,0:07:07.480
You went to a cemetery...

0:07:07.480,0:07:12.020
A brother carried you there, who acted as your boyfriend.

0:07:12.020,0:07:14.860
Yes.

0:07:14.860,0:07:18.300
Since then, your life has not been the same.

0:07:18.300,0:07:18.820
It has never.

0:07:18.820,0:07:28.180
There's nothing since that time – smoking, drinking, cocaine, drugs, whatever - evil things are in your hands.

0:07:28.180,0:07:31.340
Yes man of God, it is true.

0:07:31.340,0:07:40.200
Ever since then, I started drinking, smoking, taking drugs; I wasn't staying at home.

0:07:40.200,0:07:46.600
I was always on the move and never had the time to spend with my family.

0:07:46.600,0:07:48.980
At that time I was always angry.

0:07:48.980,0:07:55.080
Every time I was with my family, I'd just felt like grabbing them and strangling them or jumping

0:07:55.080,0:07:58.080
onto them and doing something bad to them.

0:07:58.080,0:08:02.540
What was responsible for that?

0:08:02.540,0:08:07.220
The evil spirit – the initiation that took place.

0:08:07.220,0:08:16.640
Tell us, did you make any effort to get a deliverance from this before coming to The SCOAN?

0:08:16.640,0:08:19.280
If yes  - what effort did you make?

0:08:19.280,0:08:25.760
I remember two years back, I went for a crusade in Botswana and that time I told them

0:08:25.760,0:08:27.960
I really wanted to be delivered.

0:08:27.960,0:08:33.320
But I was too influenced to go back there.

0:08:33.320,0:08:44.240
From there, I started going back to my old life and my dad told me that he was going to pay for me to come to

0:08:44.240,0:08:46.820
The SCOAN.

0:08:46.820,0:08:51.420
I didn't feel good about it, I actually ran away from home at that time.

0:08:51.420,0:08:57.920
I stayed almost a month and a half without seeing my family because I was told to do so.

0:08:57.920,0:09:00.500
One day he called me and said I should just come home.

0:09:00.500,0:09:06.520
So, I left where I was staying, went home and we actually talked about it and came to a point of

0:09:06.520,0:09:15.080
agreement that OK, fine - I'm going to The SCOAN and here I am standing, delivered

0:09:15.080,0:09:18.320
and I have accepted Jesus in my heart.

0:09:18.320,0:09:19.560
To God be the glory.

0:09:19.560,0:09:28.940
Tell us, when you left your home - where you went to and what was happening at that time with you.

0:09:28.940,0:09:37.920
At that time I was staying with my boyfriend, who was my boyfriend at that time and

0:09:37.920,0:09:46.760
sometimes I stayed with my friends and we weren't even staying in a house, we would just go to the house

0:09:46.760,0:09:57.660
to change and go clubbing, drinking, taking drugs, smoking, doing every negative thing we could think of.

0:09:57.660,0:10:12.740
Tell us, what kind of feelings, experiences or dreams were you having after that initiation.

0:10:12.740,0:10:21.220
Sometimes I dreamt of dead people; sometimes I dreamt of people wearing black trying to kill me.

0:10:21.220,0:10:28.700
Sometimes – even if I was alone in the house, I'd just fear - I'd feel as if there were something wrong

0:10:28.700,0:10:29.760
inside the house.

0:10:29.760,0:10:31.920
I wasn't secure about myself.

0:10:31.920,0:10:36.100
Before the prophecy, I felt like running away when I was sitting there.

0:10:36.100,0:10:42.840
But as the man of God was praying for me I felt as if there were something heavy getting our of my body.

0:10:42.840,0:10:51.780
It just came out and I felt lighter and better from then.

0:11:09.320,0:11:17.080
Out!

0:11:17.080,0:11:19.820
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:11:19.820,0:11:28.400
The spirit of killing, stealing, destruction – out!

0:11:28.400,0:11:34.940
But as the man of God was praying for me I felt as if there were something heavy getting our of my body.

0:11:34.940,0:11:41.780
It just came out and I felt lighter and better from then.

0:11:41.780,0:11:44.120
To God be the glory.

0:11:44.120,0:11:51.080
Now, with what you have experienced; you are telling us that you are totally delivered?

0:11:51.080,0:11:53.660
Yes, I am. I am totally delivered.

0:11:53.660,0:11:54.800
Hallelujah.

0:11:54.800,0:11:59.780
Now, for the benefit of those who are listening to this wonderful testimony;

0:11:59.780,0:12:06.920
can you give a word of advice, specially to youth out there, and to people generally?

0:12:06.920,0:12:10.380
What do you want them to learn from your experience?

0:12:10.380,0:12:18.420
And those who are still entangled in the wilderness of evil - what advice do you have for them?

0:12:18.440,0:12:24.140
I would say they should come out from where they are and accept Jesus as their Saviour;

0:12:24.140,0:12:27.180
they should just accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.

0:12:27.180,0:12:35.340
I pray that God uses me as a person to show them that whatever they are doing,

0:12:35.340,0:12:40.560
they can always come out of the situation they're in now.

0:12:40.560,0:12:47.940
I remember confronting a witchdoctor; I went there alone and I thought it would better

0:12:47.940,0:12:50.520
but nothing worked out.

0:12:50.520,0:13:02.080
I went for a crusade and they tried their best but it's just that the force from the dark side, the evil side was too

0:13:02.080,0:13:08.260
much on me which happened that I went back there.

0:13:08.260,0:13:12.780
We could see you screaming when the man of God laid hand on you.

0:13:12.780,0:13:16.620
Can you tell us what you felt at that time?

0:13:16.620,0:13:29.260
At that time I was having those visions of what was happening at the grave.

0:13:29.260,0:13:37.360
At the same time it was like the thing that whatever was coming out of me was just too much for me.

0:13:37.360,0:13:41.820
So, I happened to start screaming.

0:13:41.820,0:13:44.340
To God be the glory.

0:13:44.340,0:13:47.460
Now you are totally delivered.

0:13:47.460,0:13:53.100
We want to encourage you to make the word of God a standard for your life.

0:13:53.100,0:13:57.760
The Bible says - those who are delivered by Christ's word must be ruled by His word.

0:13:57.760,0:14:04.580
As you do so, the deliverance you have received today will be permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.

0:14:04.580,0:14:07.280
Amen.

0:14:07.280,0:14:11.020
Testimony time.

0:14:11.020,0:14:14.520
Here is Mr Jacob.

0:14:14.520,0:14:17.840
I am from Botswana.

0:14:17.840,0:14:23.540
The reason I'm here today - on the 18th of April 2010,

0:14:23.540,0:14:28.420
a miracle happened right here at The SCOAN.

0:14:28.420,0:14:38.620
I wanted to be here with my daughter that day but because of circumstances beyond my control,

0:14:38.620,0:14:39.540
I couldn't make it.

0:14:39.540,0:14:47.160
She had to come on her own here and she got her deliverance.

0:14:47.160,0:14:59.420
For three to four years, I went through serious parental pain because of this little girl.

0:14:59.420,0:15:15.020
I think at the age of thirteen, somehow, somewhere in this crazy world, she came across some evil people,

0:15:15.020,0:15:21.640
she came across some agents of lucifer.

0:15:21.640,0:15:31.920
They recruited her into their kingdom; they initiated her and she was lost.

0:15:31.920,0:15:42.580
And you know, if you lose a daughter through the work of the devil the whole house becomes possessed

0:15:42.580,0:15:45.180
because of the evil spirits;

0:15:45.180,0:15:53.640
you don’t find peace with your family; you don’t find peace with your wife; I'd always fight and say to my wife,

0:15:53.640,0:16:00.020
'I think you know where my daughter is. You really can't tell me that you are here sleeping and the daughter

0:16:00.020,0:16:03.480
is not in the house'.

0:16:03.480,0:16:10.080
But at the end of the day, something told me that there was a man of God.

0:16:10.080,0:16:15.840
In 2005, he visited my country, Botswana.

0:16:15.840,0:16:20.940
I went to that Crusade and saw people being delivered.

0:16:20.940,0:16:24.840
5th January I started watching Emmanuel TV.

0:16:24.840,0:16:27.080
For three years she was out of school.

0:16:27.080,0:16:29.900
She wanted to go back to school.

0:16:29.900,0:16:36.920
We talked with the mother and gave her the school fees.

0:16:36.920,0:16:42.180
The first school we went to said she is too old, that she can't do form four.

0:16:42.180,0:16:43.900
At seventeen.

0:16:43.900,0:16:45.360
The second school, the same story.

0:16:45.360,0:16:52.520
I said to my wife, "For God's sake, I'm not facing the devil again. Give me that school fee.

0:16:52.520,0:16:57.440
I want to pay for this girl's trip to Nigeria, to The SCOAN."

0:16:57.440,0:17:05.520
And by God's grace my wife didn't give me any problem; she gave me the money and I looked for my own airfare.

0:17:05.520,0:17:11.080
I paid but when she came, I stayed behind.

0:17:11.080,0:17:16.860
When her group went back, I phoned some people here and I don’t want my daughter to come back home.

0:17:16.860,0:17:19.300
I was afraid it was too early.

0:17:19.300,0:17:22.500
I was afraid because she came here without me, without her mother.

0:17:22.500,0:17:29.280
I wanted her to stay behind for two weeks until I'd be there and I am here.

0:17:29.280,0:17:36.700
I am here with her and I'm seeing a different person, a completely different young girl.

0:17:36.700,0:17:39.600
Amen.

0:17:39.600,0:17:46.660
Can you tell us sir, when your daughter came to The SCOAN - were you back at home watching her

0:17:46.660,0:17:48.300
during that Sunday Service?

0:17:48.300,0:17:50.920
I was home watching her.

0:17:50.920,0:17:55.220
You know, since January...

0:17:55.220,0:17:57.160
It's difficult for me to attend any church.

0:17:57.160,0:18:01.860
Most of the time, my church is my sitting room.

0:18:01.860,0:18:06.420
I watch Emmanuel TV at home almost every Sunday alone in that house.

0:18:06.420,0:18:09.920
But that Sunday everybody was there.

0:18:09.920,0:18:12.040
We saw the first service.

0:18:12.040,0:18:22.980
I had the Bible in my hand praying, "Let the hand of God point to my daughter.

0:18:22.980,0:18:27.040
Let the man of God prophesy to my daughter".

0:18:27.040,0:18:32.920
Indeed – he saw her at the prayer line.

0:18:32.920,0:18:36.840
I said, "I think I saw light".

0:18:36.840,0:18:42.200
Then at the second service, the TV's went off in my village because it was raining.

0:18:42.200,0:18:49.140
We couldn’t see it but my cell phone started ringing.

0:18:49.140,0:18:55.500
I switched off my phone but believe me, I wept like a little baby.

0:18:55.500,0:19:00.820
I didn’t see that picture but everybody started calling, asking that, "Did you see your daughter?"

0:19:00.820,0:19:07.660
And I cried more because my old mother was there sitting beside me.

0:19:07.660,0:19:14.780
The relationship between my family and me was all gone because of this little girl.

0:19:14.780,0:19:23.460
But that Sunday, they started coming as if they were always in my house and I say, "Thank God!"

0:19:23.460,0:19:31.580
I said if this family can know that the living God is there; if they can realise that God is living,

0:19:31.580,0:19:35.420
I don’t have to say, "Forgive me" or "I forgive you".

0:19:35.420,0:19:41.320
That day, they came in one by one and started praising our Lord Jesus Christ.

0:19:41.320,0:19:47.720
Hallelujah. Let's clap for Jesus!

0:19:47.720,0:19:55.500
Believe me, even yesterday, I understand that they were all at my place.

0:19:55.500,0:19:59.440
This is a really wonderful moment.

0:19:59.440,0:20:05.320
This lady has changed and I'm so happy.

0:20:05.320,0:20:07.780
She is a changed lady.

0:20:07.780,0:20:16.580
I've been a believer and I've been a Christian but like T.B. Joshua also says,

0:20:16.580,0:20:23.360
I was just a traditional Christian, I was just a traditional believer;

0:20:23.360,0:20:29.560
but now I am a true Christian and a true believer.

0:20:29.560,0:20:35.560
We thank God for your life and the restoration, God Almighty has brought to you and your home.

0:20:35.560,0:20:37.140
Thank you very much for sharing it with us.

0:20:37.140,0:20:37.900
Can we clap for Jesus?

0:20:37.900,0:20:41.960
Amen.

0:20:41.960,0:20:44.960
Now we want to speak to this young lady sitting next to you.

0:20:44.960,0:20:45.900
Please take the microphone.

0:20:45.900,0:20:49.060
Can you tell us your name and who is this man sitting next to you here?

0:20:49.060,0:20:51.780
My name is Tricia.

0:20:51.780,0:20:53.260
I am from Botswana

0:20:53.260,0:20:55.680
This is my dad sitting next to me.

0:20:55.680,0:21:05.680
I came to The SCOAN for Sunday service and the man of God prophesied that there's a lady here

0:21:05.680,0:21:14.540
and he came to me and pulled me out of the crowd, and he asked me if I knew why he took me out of the crowd.

0:21:14.540,0:21:26.240
I'm seeing you on a cemetery and you were given something like blood to drink as an initiation.

0:21:26.240,0:21:27.560
Yes, it is true.

0:21:27.560,0:21:31.120
It was in the night.

0:21:31.120,0:21:36.600
You went to a cemetery...

0:21:36.600,0:21:41.160
A brother carried you there, who acted as your boyfriend.

0:21:41.160,0:21:43.980
Yes.

0:21:43.980,0:21:47.380
Since then, your life has not been the same.

0:21:47.380,0:21:48.220
It has never.

0:21:48.220,0:21:57.300
There's nothing since that time – smoking, drinking, cocaine, drugs, whatever - evil things are in your hands.

0:21:57.300,0:22:00.660
Yes man of God, it is true.

0:22:00.660,0:22:06.040
And he prayed for me and I got delivered and ever since that day

0:22:06.040,0:22:14.500
I have never had the same dreams I used to have.

0:22:29.560,0:22:37.360
Out!

0:22:37.360,0:22:39.760
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:22:39.760,0:22:42.140
After the prophecy the man of God prayed for you.

0:22:42.140,0:22:45.040
What did you experience when the man of God prayed for you?

0:22:45.040,0:22:53.260
I wasn’t really feeling myself at that time but ever since then, I think I have really changed because

0:22:53.260,0:23:02.720
ever since I got here, I've never craved for alcohol or drugs and if I remember very well,

0:23:02.720,0:23:09.540
I bought a pack of cigarettes at the Johannesburg airport and I only took one cigarette there

0:23:09.540,0:23:16.340
and came here with the pack here but I couldn’t take any more because ever since I walked through

0:23:16.340,0:23:21.860
that gate, I have never ever craved for cigarettes again.

0:23:21.860,0:23:22.560
Hallelujah.

0:23:22.560,0:23:26.700
Let's clap for Jesus!

0:23:26.700,0:23:27.620
Amen.

0:23:27.620,0:23:33.000
Can you be bold and tell us how old are you having experienced all this in life?

0:23:33.000,0:23:36.320
I am 17 years old.

0:23:36.320,0:23:41.660
What is your advice to those who are watching and listening to you, after you have been delivered

0:23:41.660,0:23:43.980
and you are living a new life?

0:23:43.980,0:23:49.580
My advice to all those people that live the life I used to live,

0:23:49.580,0:23:59.340
I will tell them to come to Jesus, repent and accept Jesus as their Saviour.

0:23:59.340,0:24:06.140
They shouldn't be scared of what is going to happen to them because once you are here,

0:24:06.140,0:24:08.820
God is going to fight the battle for you.

0:24:08.820,0:24:09.560
Amen.

0:24:09.560,0:24:11.280
Can you give us a very special message?

0:24:11.280,0:24:15.800
What do you want to say to your father and your family, that is watching you at home?

0:24:15.800,0:24:23.980
I'd like to say I'm sorry for destroying my family, it wasn't really what I wanted to do.

0:24:23.980,0:24:27.980
I would like to say I'm sorry.

0:24:27.980,0:24:33.240
And now that I have changed, I promise never to do the bad things I used to do.

0:24:33.240,0:24:42.120
Can we see you giving your father a warm embrace after all these years of problems and difficulties?

0:24:46.460,0:24:49.620
Daddy, I'm sorry and my family at home.

0:24:49.620,0:24:55.760
I'm really sorry for what I did; I love all of you.

0:24:55.760,0:24:59.960
Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:24:59.960,0:25:05.000
Remember, as the Prophet taught us on Sunday - "Love does not discuss sin.

0:25:05.000,0:25:07.540
Love does not draw attention to sin".

0:25:07.540,0:25:12.900
As the Bible says - "Love covers a multitude of sin by forgiving".

0:25:12.900,0:25:17.200
Let us clap for our Lord Jesus Christ!
