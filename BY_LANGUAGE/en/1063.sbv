0:00:00.000,0:00:04.840
There is a gentleman – you are a witch doctor.

0:00:04.840,0:00:09.980
You need to come out because your situation demands for me to see you.

0:00:09.980,0:00:14.760
As we are here, people are waiting in your house to see you.

0:00:14.760,0:00:16.660
You are a witch doctor.

0:00:16.660,0:00:21.860
Please, come out – Jesus loves you.

0:00:21.860,0:00:27.840
After hearing the prophecy from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, the witch doctor comes forward.

0:00:27.840,0:00:30.280
Man of God, I am the witch doctor you were talking about.

0:00:30.280,0:00:32.000
- You are a witch doctor?
- Yes, sir.

0:00:32.000,0:00:38.080
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:38.080,0:00:42.700
After the service, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:00:42.700,0:00:46.620
The power of the Holy Spirit causes many to fall under the anointing.

0:00:46.620,0:00:51.560
When the witch doctor, who received the prophecy comes forward, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for him,

0:00:51.560,0:00:57.660
and every chain that satan used to connect him to himself is broken, putting an end to his past,

0:00:57.660,0:01:01.000
and giving birth to his future, in Jesus' name.

0:01:01.000,0:01:05.340
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:05.340,0:01:10.080
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:01:10.080,0:01:18.280
My name is His Mystical Majesty Dr. Prof. Anayo Umumakwe.

0:01:18.280,0:01:25.860
Originally I'm from Imo State but I reside in Enugu State, Nigeria - that is where I stay and practice.

0:01:25.860,0:01:30.260
The next person to me is my beautiful and humble wife,

0:01:30.260,0:01:32.480
and my third son,

0:01:32.480,0:01:33.740
and this is the last boy.

0:01:33.740,0:01:35.920
The other two boys are not here.

0:01:35.920,0:01:40.840
Can you tell us as a witch doctor...

0:01:40.840,0:01:45.580
You introduced yourself as a "Mystical Majesty".

0:01:45.580,0:01:52.080
Now, tell us, how you practice this witch doctor's art, and how did it all begin.

0:01:52.080,0:01:55.380
My mother told me that I stayed 18 months in the womb.

0:01:55.380,0:02:03.440
So, when I was born, they said they went somewhere, because my family has an idol-worshipping background.

0:02:03.440,0:02:10.940
There were so many great men before me; they said I was the next high priest.

0:02:10.940,0:02:17.260
At the age of 16 I started having hallucinations, I could not stay in the class, I was living in a dormitory.

0:02:17.260,0:02:20.520
Sometimes, I left the dormitory and went to sleep in the bush.

0:02:20.520,0:02:23.640
Sometimes, I would go and sleep in an uncompleted building.

0:02:23.640,0:02:27.420
Something used to tell me; there was something that used to talk to me,

0:02:27.420,0:02:30.080
"Go away from here, these people want to kill you".

0:02:30.080,0:02:32.520
You mean you used to hear voices at that tender age?

0:02:32.520,0:02:34.380
Yes, I used to hear voices.

0:02:34.380,0:02:38.640
When my parents got to know this, they said they went somewhere,

0:02:38.640,0:02:43.740
and they said that the time for me to start my work has come.

0:02:43.740,0:02:48.040
We were living in Abia State, so we went home.

0:02:48.040,0:02:50.920
My grandmother and my father were alive then;

0:02:50.920,0:02:56.540
they brought a very known herbal doctor, known all over in my area.

0:02:56.540,0:03:00.540
He came and performed the rite; they made the shrine for me.

0:03:00.540,0:03:12.720
In that shrine a clay-pot was half-buried in the ground, and they used sticks to make the shrine.

0:03:12.720,0:03:18.520
A cock was killed, and they said I should put my hand in that clay-pot.

0:03:18.520,0:03:24.380
I put my two hands; they used the blood to wash my hands inside that pot.

0:03:24.380,0:03:29.240
They put so many things in that pot which I cannot remember now.

0:03:29.240,0:03:35.200
They told me that it was my shrine; that whenever I had a problem,

0:03:35.200,0:03:38.480
I should come to this place and talk to the ancestors,

0:03:38.480,0:03:42.860
and whenever I started doing my work, this was were my powers lay.

0:03:42.860,0:03:50.780
Any person that came to me; I should bring anything brought by that person; fowl, goats or cow -

0:03:50.780,0:03:54.100
I would bring it to this oracle.

0:03:54.100,0:03:55.600
So, I went back to school.

0:03:55.600,0:04:03.060
When I went back to school, the conditions became worse, but I managed to finish my secondary school.

0:04:03.060,0:04:05.360
When I finished secondary school...

0:04:05.360,0:04:08.780
Apart from all these things, I was still very intelligent at school.

0:04:08.780,0:04:11.580
My parents wanted me to read law.

0:04:11.580,0:04:14.920
I asked my father, "You said that I was a chief priest, a high priest.

0:04:14.920,0:04:18.040
What am I going to do at the university? Let me start the work."

0:04:18.040,0:04:21.080
He said, "No".

0:04:21.080,0:04:27.900
So that spirit was there pushing you to start the work as a priest?

0:04:27.900,0:04:30.560
Yes, the spirit started directing me.

0:04:30.560,0:04:37.280
Some people, to whom I wasn't introduced to, would even come to me saying they were sick.

0:04:37.280,0:04:41.700
They would say that there was somebody who told them that I had powers and that I should heal them.

0:04:41.700,0:04:47.540
I was going to the bush to bring leaves, then I would put them together, and the people would say they're OK.

0:04:47.540,0:04:49.240
Other people would come.

0:04:49.240,0:04:53.940
So, I believed that that was my calling.

0:04:53.940,0:04:55.540
I refused to go to the university.

0:04:55.540,0:04:58.920
I was very intelligent; my father wanted me to read law.

0:04:58.920,0:05:00.260
I said, "No".

0:05:00.260,0:05:05.280
I ran away from house - that was what the spirit told me.

0:05:05.280,0:05:12.660
So, because of this witch doctor practice or calling, that you believed you received,

0:05:12.660,0:05:15.580
you were unable to go further in your education, to the university?

0:05:15.580,0:05:16.320
Yes.

0:05:16.320,0:05:21.680
But initially, when you started, you introduced yourself as a "Professor Doctor"...

0:05:21.680,0:05:23.700
No, His Mystical Majesty!

0:05:23.700,0:05:26.960
"His Mystical Majesty",

0:05:26.960,0:05:28.540
and Professor Doctor...

0:05:28.540,0:05:29.720
Yeah, Doctor Professor.

0:05:29.720,0:05:32.460
How did you come about this, sir?

0:05:32.460,0:05:35.660

Prophecy Testimony

0:05:35.660,0:05:39.440
No, these things, they came spontaneously.

0:05:39.440,0:05:42.520
At any stage, they would tell me what to do, what to say.

0:05:42.520,0:05:49.220
What really happened was - that when I left the house, I ran to Owerri and entered the police.

0:05:49.220,0:05:51.180
My parents didn't know where I was.

0:05:51.180,0:05:55.040
I was about 3-4 months in the training school.

0:05:55.040,0:06:00.900
My father eventually found me; I don't know how they managed to find me in the police college.

0:06:00.900,0:06:06.640
My father went to the commandant and reported that I was his son, and he wanted to go home with me,

0:06:06.640,0:06:10.560
that they had made arrangements for me to enter the university.

0:06:10.560,0:06:16.340
Then the commandant asked my father to bring me inside the office.

0:06:16.340,0:06:19.000
He asked me, "Young man, do you really like police work?"

0:06:19.000,0:06:21.240
I said, "Yes, I want to do police work."

0:06:21.240,0:06:25.280
Then he begged my father to leave me; that maybe this was my calling.

0:06:25.280,0:06:26.540
My father went away.

0:06:26.540,0:06:30.000
When I finished the training, I was supposed to come to Lagos.

0:06:30.000,0:06:33.700
I don't know who told them that I was a native doctor.

0:06:33.700,0:06:41.300
In the night, when convulsions got the children of our officers, they would come and wake me in the night,

0:06:41.300,0:06:44.360
saying that they heard that I was a native doctor, and I would treat that person.

0:06:44.360,0:06:52.280
My fellow recruits, when they were sick, would come to me and tell me that they heard that I was a native doctor.

0:06:52.280,0:06:56.740
I would just enter the bush and bring 1 or 2 leaves, which I don't even know.

0:06:56.740,0:07:00.740
Sometimes, I would squeeze it and give it to them to drink.

0:07:00.740,0:07:02.100
After that, they would be well.

0:07:02.100,0:07:05.160
People would continue to come more and more.

0:07:05.160,0:07:10.180
I left the police and went to a village; there is a village in the east,

0:07:10.180,0:07:18.400
which is known for traditional healing and 419, and all dubious characters.

0:07:18.400,0:07:20.960
I went to the village with my wife.

0:07:20.960,0:07:25.940
By then, I only had one son and the second one was in the womb.

0:07:25.940,0:07:28.240
We lived there for some time.

0:07:28.240,0:07:31.060
Then, I graduated, I learnt.

0:07:31.060,0:07:35.540
People were saying, "You are very powerful. Any person you give medicine gets healed.

0:07:35.540,0:07:39.980
Why don't you do like this; so that you get big money from people?"

0:07:39.980,0:07:47.640
Eventually, the federal government invaded that village because of too much atrocities.

0:07:47.640,0:07:54.880
Then, I ran away with my wife and my son; we went back to Aba, where we were living.

0:07:54.880,0:07:58.840
I continued to practise this thing.

0:07:58.840,0:08:07.280
Eventually, the goverment of Abia State started wiping other states with these Bakassi boys.

0:08:07.280,0:08:12.980
I felt that maybe they would come after me, because by then I had touched too many people's lives.

0:08:12.980,0:08:23.340
OK, so that place you visited,; where there are witch doctors, who are also into 419 and others;

0:08:23.340,0:08:27.540
tell us what are the things you learnt there, and what are the things you began to practise.

0:08:27.540,0:08:38.160
They taught me how to "wash money", how to "speak as a spirit", so people would believe that the spirit is talking.

0:08:38.160,0:08:45.260
Before then I hadn't known those things, so I combined it with my own, natural knowledge.

0:08:45.260,0:08:47.700
Was there anything like "washing money"?

0:08:47.700,0:08:50.080
No! Actually there is nothing like "washing money";

0:08:50.080,0:08:57.000
all those things are devil's ways of tricking and cheating people.

0:08:57.000,0:09:02.060
Money is only printed by a central bank; you cannot wash or invoke money.

0:09:02.060,0:09:07.500
They taught me how to do these invocations and how to "wash money".

0:09:07.500,0:09:13.080
I left that place and went to Enugu when they started ransacking the area.

0:09:13.080,0:09:18.540
I went with my wife; by then the other child had been born - we went to Enugu.

0:09:18.540,0:09:31.240
When we went to Enugu, I started practising these things again; by then I started to sell drugs, Indian hemp.

0:09:31.240,0:09:36.160
People were coming to buy Indian hemp and with other problems.

0:09:36.160,0:09:41.860
Eventually, at that time, I started selling even the cocaine and I smoked...

0:09:41.860,0:09:46.900
I smoked to an extent that my wife got worried, we were always quarrelling.

0:09:46.900,0:09:50.960
She was asking, "When will you leave this thing? This thing has destroyed many lives."

0:09:50.960,0:09:56.980
Often, police would come to the house, raid our house, see my wife's jewellery and money

0:09:56.980,0:10:00.460
because she had a provisional store, where she was selling.

0:10:00.460,0:10:04.880
They would steal her money and jewellery, they would say that this was "drug money".

0:10:04.880,0:10:09.960
Most of the times, they would put me in detention, where only my wife would visit me.

0:10:09.960,0:10:16.680
By then, I didn't have any relations, where I could take refuge.

0:10:16.680,0:10:23.000
It was my wife who came to the police to bail me.

0:10:23.000,0:10:25.180
After some time, she got tired.

0:10:25.180,0:10:32.520
She told me that if I didn't stop this business, I would go to prison.

0:10:32.520,0:10:40.520
I considered that aspect and I left drugs business, but I was still doing this "herbal business".

0:10:40.520,0:10:45.660
When I went to the river, I would make invocations.

0:10:45.660,0:10:55.920
There are certain foods that fish like; when you throw this thing into the water, water will make a very big noise,

0:10:55.920,0:10:58.800
because all the fish would come to eat that thing.

0:10:58.800,0:11:02.940
Then you tell them that the mermaid has come out.

0:11:02.940,0:11:05.160
OK.

0:11:05.160,0:11:11.520
To get you clear; you mean - when people come to you to do some job for them...

0:11:11.520,0:11:15.460
What are the problems they would complain about, before you take them to the river,

0:11:15.460,0:11:17.940
to make all those sacrifices?

0:11:17.940,0:11:24.720
Some complain of barrenness, of bad business, some other problems -

0:11:24.720,0:11:29.440
maybe sudden death in the family, hatred, and other problems.

0:11:29.440,0:11:34.580
I would take them to the river, telling them that it was a river mermaid that would solve this problem.

0:11:34.580,0:11:38.540
So, you used to tell them that you have a river mermaid that would solve their problem?

0:11:38.540,0:11:39.400
Yes.

0:11:39.400,0:11:46.580
How do you get the attention of the river mermaid, what are the tricks you used to deceive the people?

0:11:46.580,0:11:51.760
You know this "macaroni", or the other long one?

0:11:51.760,0:11:56.660
You soak it in water; fish like worms...

0:11:56.660,0:11:59.400
When you soak it in water, you will take it to the river.

0:11:59.400,0:12:02.640
The moment you put it inside the river, the river will make a very big noise,

0:12:02.640,0:12:05.660
because all the fish will come to eat it.

0:12:05.660,0:12:09.080
You tell them that the mermaid has come.

0:12:09.080,0:12:12.820
They would be behind me; then, I would change my voice...

0:12:12.820,0:12:15.360
So, you mean your clients would stand behind you?

0:12:15.360,0:12:16.140
They would stand behind me.

0:12:16.140,0:12:17.440
You would be facing...?

0:12:17.440,0:12:18.760
I would be facing the river.

0:12:18.760,0:12:19.480
OK.

0:12:19.480,0:12:30.100
Then, after doint that, I would take both my hands up and say, "Remember, that you promised me

0:12:30.100,0:12:33.620
that whenever I come to you, you would answer me. Come now and answer me.

0:12:33.620,0:12:38.520
I brought Mr. "so and so" for "so and so" problem, and he wants the problem to be solved."

0:12:38.520,0:12:41.720
Who were you speaking to, or who were you pretending to be speaking to?

0:12:41.720,0:12:47.900
I was speaking to the mermaid that has come out now, as a result of...

0:12:55.380,0:12:59.420
Amen.

0:12:59.420,0:13:03.460
OK.
Amen.

0:13:03.460,0:13:08.920
You mean, at the time you got there with your client, your client was standing behind you,

0:13:08.920,0:13:14.220
and you were facing the river, after throwing that "macaroni" or "spaghetti" into the water,

0:13:14.220,0:13:17.860
all the fish would gather to eat, you would tell them, "Oh, the mermaid has come!"?

0:13:17.860,0:13:18.720
Yes.

0:13:18.720,0:13:22.300
By the time you spoke all those things, you would make them believe that you were talking to the mermaid?

0:13:22.300,0:13:22.900
Yes.

0:13:22.900,0:13:24.340
OK, continue from there.

0:13:24.340,0:13:30.580
If the person was very far behind me, I could use my hand and to put it in my nose,

0:13:30.580,0:13:41.760
"Ahhh...

0:13:41.760,0:13:46.160
Professor, why have you come to this place to disturb me?"

0:13:46.160,0:13:53.380
I would say, "My lord, it is because of the problem of this Mr "so and so" - that's why we are here."

0:14:08.840,0:14:15.380
"Why have you come to disturb me? Don't you know that I'm wrestling with my children?"

0:14:15.380,0:14:21.120
I would say, "My mother, don't be annoyed. You know that other people I brought the other day,

0:14:21.120,0:14:24.660
they brought goods after. Please, heal them."

0:14:24.660,0:14:26.960
Then I would call the client, "Did you hear what the mermaid was saying?"

0:14:26.960,0:14:28.220
He would say, "Yes".

0:14:28.220,0:14:31.100
"OK. Now, you will be healed."

0:14:31.100,0:14:39.980
I would say, "Mermaid said that you need to bring a goat, this and that, including money, 20, 30 or 40 thousand."

0:14:39.980,0:14:42.840
Everything would be brought into the river.

0:14:42.840,0:14:44.220
When the client goes...

0:14:44.220,0:14:49.080
Sometimes, he would be with the money - we check everything -

0:14:49.080,0:14:52.740
and that money would be thrown inside the water.

0:14:52.740,0:14:55.000
The money that they brought...

0:14:55.000,0:14:57.960
Sometimes, you charged them money, they would bring the money.

0:14:57.960,0:15:00.960
You used to charge your clients some money?

0:15:00.960,0:15:07.100
The mermaid would charge them, "That was what the mermaid said; that I'm..."

0:15:14.620,0:15:18.200
So, what the mermaid said was what I would tell them,

0:15:18.200,0:15:26.040
but the mermaid did not say anything - you know that I'm the...

0:15:26.040,0:15:30.620
When they brought the money, I would first of all...

0:15:30.620,0:15:36.280
Because I had a place I used to stay and do this work - it was under three mango trees.

0:15:36.280,0:15:39.080
There is a very big shelter.

0:15:39.080,0:15:44.280
I would ask them to buy a white handkerchief.

0:15:44.280,0:15:48.760
When they bought the handkerchief, I would first of all tie his or her own money,

0:15:48.760,0:15:51.000
so that I would know the volume.

0:15:51.000,0:15:56.160
Then, I would enter inside the house and cut paper to the size of that money.

0:15:56.160,0:15:59.460
Then, I would tight it to the size of that money.

0:15:59.460,0:16:04.360
I have a bag that I used - I call it "my magical bag".

0:16:04.360,0:16:09.080
The bag has many "compartments" at the front and back.

0:16:09.080,0:16:15.340
That money would be in one "compartment", and the fake one in another "compartment".

0:16:15.340,0:16:19.720
When we got to the river, I would bring that... because it was already tied -

0:16:19.720,0:16:21.220
he didn't know if it was his money or not.

0:16:21.220,0:16:25.200
When men were looking at it, nobody would not know the difference between the two handkerchiefs?

0:16:25.200,0:16:26.620
No no no, it was a white handkerchief.

0:16:26.620,0:16:30.880
But you would know the one that was containing the real and the other the fake money?

0:16:30.880,0:16:31.760
- Yes.
- OK.

0:16:31.760,0:16:37.460
I would bring that fake one and ask the person to turn it around his head,

0:16:37.460,0:16:40.120
and to tell the mermaid to solve his problems.

0:16:40.120,0:16:42.360
The person would throw this thing.

0:16:42.360,0:16:44.720
He would believe that the money has been given to the mermaid.

0:16:44.720,0:16:46.300
Meanwhile, the real money was where?

0:16:46.300,0:16:50.160
It was in my pocket; it was my money now.

0:16:55.760,0:16:58.400
So, what happened after that?

0:16:58.400,0:16:59.880
Then, we would go home...

0:16:59.880,0:17:06.320
No, before you went home, apart from taking the money, did the mermaid request any other thing

0:17:06.320,0:17:08.980
or did you request any other thing from your clients?

0:17:08.980,0:17:13.780
Sometimes, the clients would bath in the river.

0:17:13.780,0:17:16.820
After some incantations, I would ask the client to bath.

0:17:16.820,0:17:21.680
When he bathed, we would collect the water; he would be using it to bath at home.

0:17:21.680,0:17:24.720
Then we would get back to the temple, the shrine.

0:17:24.720,0:17:30.980
When we got back to the shrine, I would prepare medicines that maybe kills that illness.

0:17:30.980,0:17:35.980
The drugs I know kills that illness - I would prepare and give it to him or her, and she would go with it.

0:17:35.980,0:17:38.100
You mean orthodox medicines?

0:17:38.100,0:17:39.680
Yes, orthodox medicines.

0:17:39.680,0:17:43.780
Not your herbal medicines now?

0:17:43.780,0:17:48.720
At the time, I went to the chemist, I learnt how to sell English drugs.

0:17:48.720,0:17:53.960
Sometimes, if it was an English medicine that would take care of the illness easily,

0:17:53.960,0:18:00.240
I would use the English medicine, but if it was the traditional one, I would give the traditional one.

0:18:00.240,0:18:03.260
OK.

0:18:03.260,0:18:09.140
Had there been a time when people came to you and complained about spiritual attacks

0:18:09.140,0:18:11.240
or poison in their bodies?

0:18:11.240,0:18:16.500
What kind of treatment did you give to them?

0:18:16.500,0:18:21.900
Actually, some people would say there was something moving in their bodies,

0:18:21.900,0:18:26.500
and some people would have swollen legs or hands.

0:18:26.500,0:18:33.540
When they came to me, I would tell them that there was something inside, moving in their body.

0:18:33.540,0:18:39.880
I had a wire and a cutter; I cut small pieces of it,

0:18:39.880,0:18:42.820
depending on the quantity I wanted to bring out of your body.

0:18:42.820,0:18:47.660
Then, I went inside the bush and put it in the leaves there.

0:18:47.660,0:18:52.500
I would just carefully stuff them.

0:18:52.500,0:18:55.260
- Into the leaves?
- Leaves!

0:18:55.260,0:19:01.800
Then I would ask you to come with me into the bush and bring these leaves out.

0:19:01.800,0:19:04.600
When we got there, I would carefully remove those ones.

0:19:04.600,0:19:07.820
You went to the very tree, where you had inserted those...?

0:19:07.820,0:19:08.920
Yes, exactly.

0:19:08.920,0:19:14.980
Then I collected the leaves and asked you to bring more; you brought more that I would add to the first ones.

0:19:14.980,0:19:26.720
When we got to the temple, I would put water in a bowl, I would move those leaves around your body,

0:19:26.720,0:19:29.780
and eventually squeeze it.

0:19:29.780,0:19:38.140
I would ask you to put your hand and bring out those wires; I would tell you that I removed all of them.

0:19:38.140,0:19:45.900
Then I would give him a medicine for swelling.

0:19:45.900,0:19:51.520
If it was rheumatism, I would give him a medicine for rheumatism.

0:19:51.520,0:19:54.060
If I wanted to give him an English medicine, I would deface it;

0:19:54.060,0:19:55.320
he would not know that it was an English medicine.

0:19:55.320,0:19:59.440
So, you were practising both witch doctor and doctor together?

0:19:59.440,0:20:03.480
Yes, exactly.

0:20:03.480,0:20:06.380
Did you go for any training as a doctor?

0:20:06.380,0:20:13.540
No no no, no formal training; all these things are allusion; they just come naturally.

0:20:13.540,0:20:17.860
Nobody taught me all those things I'm telling you about, now.

0:20:17.860,0:20:26.100
OK. How else did you deceive people, and how else did these things affect your life negatively?

0:20:26.100,0:20:27.920
This thing has...

0:20:27.920,0:20:31.660
I have touched lives of so many people negatively - it distorted my life.

0:20:31.660,0:20:34.280
I'm a human being, I have conscience.

0:20:34.280,0:20:39.760
At the time, the thing started disturbing my conscience.

0:20:39.760,0:20:41.380
I was looking for a way out.

0:20:41.380,0:20:45.880
I even tried to destroy some of the things by myself, but still...

0:20:45.880,0:20:49.260
I came to know this Emmanuel TV, and I saw...

0:20:49.260,0:20:52.440
OK, before you talk about how you came about to know Emmanuel TV,

0:20:52.440,0:20:58.960
tell us what happened when you made these charms for people, or these medicines you gave to them,

0:20:58.960,0:21:00.880
and they didn't work, and they came back to you.

0:21:00.880,0:21:02.240
How did you handle it?

0:21:02.240,0:21:05.080
Well, I would change it to another form.

0:21:05.080,0:21:11.360
Some of them made problem and went; they just talked because they were afraid of me.

0:21:11.360,0:21:15.900
So, even when it didn't work for them, they were afraid to come and confront you sometimes?

0:21:15.900,0:21:20.580
Sometimes they confronted me but they would go; they would not do anything because...

0:21:20.580,0:21:24.320
Don't you know what it means to take somebody to the river and bring out the mermaid?

0:21:24.320,0:21:28.240
They believed that I was a small god, they didn't...

0:21:28.240,0:21:29.960
OK.

0:21:29.960,0:21:33.820
So, how did you come about Emmanuel TV?

0:21:33.820,0:21:40.460
It was my son; they came home and told me, "Daddy, there is a channel.

0:21:40.460,0:21:43.580
There is a man of God who is doing wonders. He is healing people.

0:21:43.580,0:21:48.160
Please, put this in our house so we could watch it."

0:21:48.160,0:21:54.400
We bought this "myTV" which is "strong" and we installed it in our house.

0:21:54.400,0:21:56.320
We started watching it.

0:21:56.320,0:21:58.480
Then my faith started...

0:21:58.480,0:22:00.140
I started regretting some of the things I did.

0:22:00.140,0:22:03.380
I saw the man of God delivering so many people; even people who were more powerful,

0:22:03.380,0:22:10.800
who did the real thing, who were more powerful than me, and they were delivered.

0:22:10.800,0:22:14.360
You mean witch doctors, like yourself, and those stronger and more powerful than you?

0:22:14.360,0:22:19.640
More powerful; like that Iguedo - something like that.

0:22:19.640,0:22:26.480
The day he came, he quenched the light, which I cannot do, and he was delivered.

0:22:26.480,0:22:32.580
I said, "I will come to this place to get delivered".

0:22:32.580,0:22:34.360
I continued watching Emmanuel TV.

0:22:34.360,0:22:37.120
From there, I made up my mind to come to Emmanuel TV.

0:22:37.120,0:22:45.560
Last Sunday, I came with a friend to this place, and the man of God located me.

0:22:45.560,0:22:52.860
When the prophecy was given, I said, "How did this man know that I was in this place?

0:22:52.860,0:22:58.920
How am I going to come out? Many of my clients will see me, that I'm a witch doctor."

0:22:58.920,0:23:01.600
What did you hear the man of God said to you?

0:23:01.600,0:23:05.500
The man of God said, "There is a man here".

0:23:05.500,0:23:07.520
He was pointing at my direction.

0:23:07.520,0:23:17.880
"There is a man here; he is a witch doctor. You need to be delivered. Come out."

0:23:17.880,0:23:21.840
I didn't know how to come out; it was when we were standing up.

0:23:21.840,0:23:29.200
Eventually, my leg started moving like this...

0:23:29.200,0:23:32.060
I was shaking like this.

0:23:32.060,0:23:37.620
Eventually, when I put my left leg, then this one followed; I came out.

0:23:47.020,0:23:49.020
Amen.

0:23:49.020,0:23:53.500
You mean when the man of God gave that message of prophecy that there was a witch doctor here

0:23:53.500,0:23:57.680
and he should come out, before you were disgraced.

0:23:57.680,0:24:02.720
You knew the prophecy was speaking directly to you?

0:24:02.720,0:24:09.480
The prophecy hit my heart, as if there was a blow - boom in my heart, here.

0:24:09.480,0:24:14.000
I said, "How did this man know that I was inside that church today?"

0:24:14.000,0:24:17.640
I felt I was going to be disgraced.

0:24:17.640,0:24:23.300
I said, "After all, this is an opportunity I've been looking for, for a very long time. Go out!"

0:24:23.300,0:24:27.380
Then, my leg started doing like this...

0:24:27.380,0:24:28.580
Who was pushing you?

0:24:28.580,0:24:30.880
I don't know - nobody!

0:24:30.880,0:24:33.320
So, just like this - my leg started doing like this.

0:24:33.320,0:24:35.960
I managed to step forward with my left leg.

0:24:35.960,0:24:41.240
When I stepped out with the left leg, the right one followed - I started coming out.

0:24:41.240,0:24:44.060
That was how you found yourself at the front of the altar?

0:24:44.060,0:24:45.380
Yes, yes, yes.

0:24:45.380,0:24:50.120
When the man of God prayed for you to deliver you, tell us - what was your experience.

0:24:50.120,0:24:53.880
When the man of God prayed for me that evening...

0:24:53.880,0:25:02.620
You know, I was a chain smoker; I smoked cigarettes, I could spend 1000 Naira on Indian hemp - it was nothing.

0:25:02.620,0:25:05.840
Even in my hotel room, where I was staying, I was smoking.

0:25:05.840,0:25:07.800
The moment the man of God prayed for me...

0:25:07.800,0:25:11.700
He hit my head; it looked as if something went out of my body.

0:25:11.700,0:25:17.840
He hit my chest; in the place he hit me here, it pained me as if it was a bullet.

0:25:17.840,0:25:22.780
It continued to pain me until I went to my hotel room to sleep.

0:25:22.780,0:25:27.220
When I woke up in the morning, I found out that there was no urge; I had forgotten the taste of smoking,

0:25:27.220,0:25:28.960
I didn't know how it used to be in my body.

0:25:28.960,0:25:32.800
Since then till now, I don't smoke any more.

0:25:38.760,0:25:49.280
All those tricks and knowledge you had about witch doctor's job, do you still remember all those things?

0:25:49.280,0:25:51.600
I'm no more interested.

0:25:51.600,0:25:53.060
Your mind is not even going there any more?

0:25:53.060,0:25:58.560
Even in the church here, now; some of my clients were calling me; so I switched off my phone.

0:25:58.560,0:26:01.160
They were complaining of one problem or another.

0:26:01.160,0:26:06.500
You mean that at that time when you were doing this job, a lot of people knew you?

0:26:06.500,0:26:09.360
Many people, people came from far away; you know Enugu -

0:26:09.360,0:26:16.000
people came from Port Harcourt, even from Lagos.

0:26:16.000,0:26:24.760
OK, so tell us, as you were practising as a witch doctor, how did this thing affect your family?

0:26:24.760,0:26:27.380
It affected my family adversely.

0:26:27.380,0:26:31.280
Most of the money I got, I used it for drugs, I didn't do anything with it.

0:26:31.280,0:26:34.280
When money was needed, I could not bring it.

0:26:34.280,0:26:38.340
I brought money when I had it, not when it was needed.

0:26:38.340,0:26:42.300
As a family man, you should continue providing every day.

0:26:42.300,0:26:46.640
Sometimes they would ask me and were surprised because of the money that was coming in.

0:26:46.640,0:26:49.980
My wife would be surpised and ask me, "What do you do with this money?"

0:26:49.980,0:26:56.040
I would say, "Why are you asking me what do I do with money? Don't ask me what I do with money.

0:26:56.040,0:27:02.340
I'm using it to keep the family up."

0:27:02.340,0:27:07.900
Another way, in which it affected my life was that people around hated me for nothing.

0:27:07.900,0:27:12.100
Anybody who was sick, they would say I was the person...

0:27:12.100,0:27:14.020
They saw me as a semi-god.

0:27:14.020,0:27:16.920
They said that I was the person who had bewitched that person.

0:27:16.920,0:27:22.440
If somebody died in the vicinity, they would say that I was the person; some even openly.

0:27:22.440,0:27:26.180
So many people are not talking to me now; they said that I was the cause

0:27:26.180,0:27:30.400
of what had happened to their leg, whilst I was not the cause.

0:27:30.400,0:27:31.740
OK.

0:27:31.740,0:27:38.460
So now, you can see that it was the demons that were working with you

0:27:38.460,0:27:42.060
and turning all these things against you.

0:27:42.060,0:27:43.720
Yes, it was the demons.

0:27:43.720,0:27:46.720
I used to see a demon in my dreams sometimes.

0:27:46.720,0:27:53.880
It would be telling me, "You have to wake up. You are not doing this work we assigned to you.

0:27:53.880,0:27:59.540
You don't give us enough animals; we need enough animal blood."

0:27:59.540,0:28:04.700
OK, so you mean that for all these years you practised as a witch doctor, you cannot give account

0:28:04.700,0:28:08.940
of what you have used the money to do; no house, no car, nothing?

0:28:08.940,0:28:14.580
No, no, no; I have used about 2 or 3 cars, but none of them...

0:28:14.580,0:28:15.880
I don't know how...

0:28:15.880,0:28:22.460
Even if the car got spoiled, I would park it and it would just decay - I would sell it as a scrap.

0:28:22.460,0:28:23.380
And today?

0:28:23.380,0:28:27.580
I have one even now, that is parked.

0:28:27.580,0:28:31.800
We thank God Almighty for your life, for your wonderful deliverance.

0:28:31.800,0:28:34.580
Before we get back to you, to listen to your word of advice,

0:28:34.580,0:28:40.700
we would like to listen to your wife and children - their own side of the story.

0:28:40.700,0:28:43.400
Good Morning, Church.

0:28:43.400,0:28:48.560
My name is Mrs Rosalyn Umumakwe.

0:28:48.560,0:28:51.260
The man beside me is my husband.

0:28:51.260,0:28:53.940
The two children there are my children.

0:28:53.940,0:28:55.260
Praise the Lord.

0:28:55.260,0:29:04.300
The prophecy that the man of God gave my husband last Sunday was 101 percent true;

0:29:04.300,0:29:07.260
my husband was a witch doctor.

0:29:07.260,0:29:12.460
It all started when I entered into a relationship with him.

0:29:12.460,0:29:16.780
Being a novice in all this, I didn't know about it.

0:29:16.780,0:29:21.040
In a short time, I started to see funny, funny things.

0:29:21.040,0:29:24.260
I began to ask him questions about all this.

0:29:24.260,0:29:29.280
He would buy incense of all kinds, different types of scents.

0:29:29.280,0:29:35.380
He would buy different types of coloured candles - big, tiny, small.

0:29:35.380,0:29:38.000
I would ask him, "What is all this?"

0:29:38.000,0:29:41.840
I would tell him that I was afraid of all this, "What do you mean by all this?"

0:29:41.840,0:29:45.740
He would tell me, "Shut up your mouth; I'm praying with all this."

0:29:45.740,0:29:48.020
I would say, "OK".

0:29:48.020,0:29:54.980
A short time after that, the demon pushed him into selling Indian hemp.

0:29:54.980,0:30:01.560
He would smoke as a chain smoker, he would smoke cocaine, he would do all sorts of things,

0:30:01.560,0:30:06.000
he would pick offence at every little thing; he was always annoyed.

0:30:06.000,0:30:12.240
I said, "My God. Is this the type of relationship I have entered?"

0:30:12.240,0:30:14.440
I would console myself.

0:30:14.440,0:30:21.040
One morning, I called him saying, "My husband, come, let us pray."

0:30:21.040,0:30:25.660
He would say, "Don't disturb me."

0:30:25.660,0:30:31.880
It affected us in a very bad way, because some people would come back and tell him,

0:30:31.880,0:30:40.340
"See. What you did for others did not work for us"; 419, selling hemp and other things were part of it.

0:30:40.340,0:30:46.860
Police would come and beat me and my children up, they would steal my money, scatter the house,

0:30:46.860,0:30:50.100
put the house upside down; I would cry.

0:30:50.100,0:30:51.420
They would leave.

0:30:51.420,0:30:56.860
The case continued like that, until one day, I caught his attention and asked him to sit down.

0:30:56.860,0:30:59.160
I told him, "Look in my eyes."

0:30:59.160,0:31:00.240
He looked at me.

0:31:00.240,0:31:06.200
I told him, "If you try this business again, I will leave you and you will go to jail."

0:31:06.200,0:31:07.960
He ran away from that one.

0:31:07.960,0:31:12.560
How do you feel now, that your husband is now delivered, after the prophecy?

0:31:12.560,0:31:18.300
I'm very very happy, I have peace and joy in my heart,

0:31:18.300,0:31:23.120
that God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua has arrested him, in Jesus' name.

0:31:23.120,0:31:24.860
- Amen!
- Emmanuel!

0:31:24.860,0:31:28.320
Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

Thank you, madam.

0:31:32.800,0:31:36.940
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:31:36.940,0:31:44.460
My name is Master Umumakwe, the man beside me is father.

0:31:44.460,0:31:51.700
The woman beside him is my mother, and that's my younger brother.

0:31:51.700,0:31:55.320
I have two elder brothers but they are not here; they are in school.

0:31:55.320,0:31:58.480
The older one is in Canada doing nursing and nursing sciences.

0:31:58.480,0:32:03.160
The other one is in the university of Nigeria, Nsukka, doing medicine.

0:32:03.160,0:32:07.760
And I will enter this year, by God's grace.

0:32:07.760,0:32:11.520
The prophecy is very correct and accurate.

0:32:11.520,0:32:17.940
You mean you have 2 elder ones; one of them is in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, studying medicine,

0:32:17.940,0:32:19.400
and the other one is in which country?

0:32:19.400,0:32:20.280
Canada.

0:32:20.280,0:32:21.140
Studying what?

0:32:21.140,0:32:22.660
Nursing and nursing sciences.

0:32:22.660,0:32:23.520
And you?

0:32:23.520,0:32:27.680
I'm an aspirant of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, for pharmaceutical science.

0:32:27.680,0:32:29.240
You are also working towards your admission?

0:32:29.240,0:32:30.080
Yes.

0:32:30.080,0:32:34.540
You mean, you - the children have very brilliant performance?

0:32:34.540,0:32:36.660
Yes, we have a very brilliant performance.

0:32:36.660,0:32:38.740
Tell us about that.

0:32:38.740,0:32:42.540
You mean that what he was practising did not affect you people?

0:32:42.540,0:32:46.180
No, it didn't affect us in our intelligence, in our family.

0:32:46.180,0:32:49.200
He himself is a very intelligent man.

0:32:49.200,0:32:54.520
I used to see his results from the secondary school; he is a very intelligent man.

0:32:59.180,0:33:09.720
When I was born into the family, my father was engaged in this native, witch doctor thing, to be precise.

0:33:09.720,0:33:19.720
He did it day and night, he never departed from it, till last Sunday, when the man of God prophesied to him.

0:33:19.720,0:33:25.820
When I saw some of all this rubbish in his life, I asked him, "What are all these things?"

0:33:25.820,0:33:27.840
He would be like, "I'm working with them".

0:33:27.840,0:33:32.560
He would buy incense of different colours, candles of different shapes and sizes.

0:33:32.560,0:33:36.700
He would see a candle that looks like a fish, I had never seen one like that, and he would buy it.

0:33:36.700,0:33:37.580
He would light it up.

0:33:37.580,0:33:45.220
In the night he would be disturbing us with some incantations that are not real; all of them are fake.

0:33:45.220,0:33:55.220
Sometimes, I would call him as a man, as I've grown up, I would call him, "Leave this thing you are doing.

0:33:55.220,0:33:58.680
All the small small boys would be doing this and you will join them."

0:33:58.680,0:34:03.940
And he is a "rope smoker"; not chain, because chain has some gaps - he was a "rope smoker".

0:34:03.940,0:34:06.740
He didn't even give gaps in smoking, at all.

0:34:06.740,0:34:12.000
He could be smoking Indian hemp with this hand, and be smoking a cigarette with the other hand.

0:34:12.000,0:34:18.820
He smoked day and night, every hour of the day he smoked and he drank.

0:34:18.820,0:34:23.440
He would be drinking and smoking with some of my class mates - boys.

0:34:23.440,0:34:27.280
If I met them, I would beat them very well, and he would be smoking with them.

0:34:27.280,0:34:32.640
When I came to school, I could not even talk in the class; if I talked, they would say, "Shut up.

0:34:32.640,0:34:34.940
Your father is a smoker, he is a native doctor."

0:34:34.940,0:34:39.500
I would just melt like an ice-block, I could not talk at all.

0:34:39.500,0:34:42.160
In my family, we are very brilliant people.

0:34:42.160,0:34:46.120
Sometimes, I would come first in my class

0:34:46.120,0:34:49.920
and they would say that my father had prepared a charm for me,

0:34:49.920,0:34:53.360
to be the first person in the class.

0:34:53.360,0:34:55.320
That made me...

0:34:55.320,0:35:01.140
Sometimes, I ran away from the first position; I would miss some exams, miss some quiz,

0:35:01.140,0:35:04.560
I would not come to school on time, so that I would miss some classes,

0:35:04.560,0:35:10.020
so that my results would not be, as they were if I was punctually in the school.

0:35:10.020,0:35:14.900
In that way they would not say that my father had given me any charms to get the first position.

0:35:14.900,0:35:23.840
But normally, if I worked accurately, I would have the first position in my class.

0:35:23.840,0:35:31.880
But I would abstain from some school activities, so that my results would not be as they would have been.

0:35:31.880,0:35:33.300
That made me...

0:35:33.300,0:35:44.080
Sometimes, I have the spirit of anger, I can get angry and beat five boys, when they come to face me.

0:35:44.080,0:35:58.020
When I was young in my family, my father used to smoke Indian hemp, cigarettes and drank strong alcohol.

0:35:58.020,0:35:59.200
The police would come.

0:35:59.200,0:36:00.600
He used to sell it also.

0:36:00.600,0:36:07.400
Police people would come to our house, even from the drugs enforcement agency.

0:36:07.400,0:36:14.020
They would turn everything upside down, steal our money, even my brother's phone,

0:36:14.020,0:36:18.720
and the clipper that my mother bought for us - they stole it.

0:36:18.720,0:36:21.060
In my family we are all boys.

0:36:21.060,0:36:31.500
Sometimes, when they came, they would first of all beat all of us, to make sure we would not attack them.

0:36:31.500,0:36:36.180
One "drug officer" hang me up in the air, when I was about 6 years old;

0:36:36.180,0:36:42.520
he hang me up, about 7 feet above the ground and he left me there.

0:36:42.520,0:36:48.420
I fell down and I broke into pieces; I couldn't even stand up, I broke my hand.

0:36:48.420,0:36:56.300
When I grew up, I told my father, "Leave all those small children's something that you are doing."

0:36:56.300,0:37:00.600
He would tell me not to disturb him, saying that this money that he has been getting from this thing,

0:37:00.600,0:37:05.100
he has been using to train me, ever since I was an embryo in my mother's womb.

0:37:05.100,0:37:11.000
So, I could not even talk because he has been the one training me.

0:37:11.000,0:37:14.320
He would give me Indian hemp to go and sell it; and I would go.

0:37:14.320,0:37:18.720
Sometimes, they would collect Indian hemp from me and they would not give me money.

0:37:18.720,0:37:22.360
If I came back home and the money was not complete, he would beat me also.

0:37:22.360,0:37:25.860
Those whom I was trying to sell Indian hemp to, would also beat me.

0:37:25.860,0:37:28.800
At the age of 4, I started selling Indian hemp.

0:37:28.800,0:37:40.740
Sometimes, I would carry it to a hidden place, made of bamboo sticks with a long bench, inside the bush.

0:37:40.740,0:37:43.880
I would go there, selling Indian hemp, collecting money.

0:37:43.880,0:37:46.740
Sometimes, they would not give me money and beat me up.

0:37:46.740,0:37:49.520
They would collect Indian hemp from me and kick me to go home.

0:37:49.520,0:37:56.060
Sometimes, I would come back home, telling him that they beat me, and collected the hemp from me.

0:37:56.060,0:38:00.600
He would say, "You know those guys that collected the hemp from you. You must go and collect my money.

0:38:00.600,0:38:03.360
If you don't collect this money, don't come back to this house."

0:38:03.360,0:38:05.740
I would go there, sit down and cry.

0:38:05.740,0:38:11.860
Sometimes, somebody would help me, saying, "Come on, my boy; take one coin - go and give to your father,

0:38:11.860,0:38:15.040
since they beat you and collected the..."

0:38:15.040,0:38:16.220
So all this while...

0:38:16.220,0:38:23.980
You mean, as a son, you didn't believe in what your father was practising, as a witch doctor?

0:38:23.980,0:38:26.460
I didn't believe him in any way.

0:38:26.460,0:38:30.300
I didn't even have trust in him.

0:38:30.300,0:38:32.740
What he was doing was totally fake.

0:38:32.740,0:38:37.300
Because I used to work with him sometimes; he would give me medicines.

0:38:37.300,0:38:42.740
Sometimes, he used to treat people and the people would get well, but the sickness would still come back.

0:38:42.740,0:38:47.760
They would come back and be like, "Since this sickness has not gone, return the money",

0:38:47.760,0:38:50.080
and we had used the money by then.

0:38:50.080,0:38:55.680
They would do some... they would fight.

0:38:55.680,0:38:59.440
If they fought, sometimes they would come with police men.

0:38:59.440,0:39:05.920
There is a stream behind our house; all of us are boys, we know how to swim - we run.

0:39:05.920,0:39:09.540
When we reached that river, we would stand there and be waiting for them.

0:39:09.540,0:39:15.340
If they got close enough, we would jump into the water and tell them to come.

0:39:15.340,0:39:18.300
They would be afraid because they didn't know how to swim.

0:39:18.300,0:39:23.800
We would swim in the river very fast, escaping from someone who wanted to collect 15 Naira from us.

0:39:23.800,0:39:29.520
We would swim from there to a very distant place and come out there.

0:39:29.520,0:39:38.040
There we would remove our clothes, stay there until they had dried.

0:39:38.040,0:39:44.200
We would call people to check if the whole place was calm, before we could come back.

0:39:44.200,0:39:49.220
If we didn't make inquiries and come back, the police might be waiting for us in the bush

0:39:49.220,0:39:53.400
or near our vicinity and they would catch us.

0:39:53.400,0:39:55.660
Every time we used to run.

0:39:55.660,0:39:58.280
It has not been easy at all.

0:39:58.280,0:40:01.100
So, there has been trouble here and there.

0:40:01.100,0:40:04.480
Every day; there was no day there wouldn't be trouble.

0:40:04.480,0:40:07.460
If there was no trouble in the house, there was no money for food.

0:40:07.460,0:40:12.920
If there was no money for food, there would be a crisis between him and my mother.

0:40:12.920,0:40:23.120
Or, when there was no money to pay school fees for my brother, I would come to him, telling him about it.

0:40:23.120,0:40:26.960
He would tell me that there was no money.

0:40:26.960,0:40:38.360
I have a bike in my area to use as a taxi; I would go to the construction sites and earn some Nairas.

0:40:38.360,0:40:44.580
I would come back with the earned money and give to him, saying, "Papa, this is money I worked for.

0:40:44.580,0:40:47.120
Must you work as a witch doctor before you get money?

0:40:47.120,0:40:49.880
Leave this witch doctor thing, find something to do".

0:40:49.880,0:40:54.180
He would be like, "If you tell me that thing again!

0:40:54.180,0:40:56.860
It is only satan that can...

0:40:56.860,0:41:01.740
God cannot come and answer him, it is only satan that can separate me and you,

0:41:01.740,0:41:07.120
if you tell me to leave this witch doctor thing again".

0:41:07.120,0:41:12.940
It happened that I used to work as an okada rider (commercial motorcyclist) in my vicinity.

0:41:12.940,0:41:17.140
Sometimes, I would get like 2000 - 2500 Naira a day.

0:41:17.140,0:41:21.260
I worked as a okada rider (commercial motorcyclist) last December.

0:41:21.260,0:41:26.340
I came to him and said, "Papa, my phone is broken and I need to buy another phone.

0:41:26.340,0:41:34.800
I'm doing something in school and I need to be online to know the latest news.

0:41:34.800,0:41:37.480
I need money to buy a new phone."

0:41:37.480,0:41:43.460
He said, "Don't even come closer to me to say it again.

0:41:43.460,0:41:48.920
Just stay like 10 metres away from me and be telling me that thing. Don't even come closer."

0:41:48.920,0:41:52.640
Sometimes, when he had money, he used to give it to me.

0:41:52.640,0:41:58.120
But anytime he didn't have money; if you came to him to ask for money, he would be very aggressive.

0:41:58.120,0:42:00.840
He has always been very aggressive?

0:42:00.840,0:42:06.680
Anytime he didn't have money, he was very aggressive, but if he had money, he would be friendly,

0:42:06.680,0:42:12.160
he would say, "Come and collect 500 Naira, go and relax."

0:42:12.160,0:42:16.620
People in our vicinity used to accuse him wrongly.

0:42:16.620,0:42:22.300
He himself didn't have the power to kill anybody, to make anybody to have a swollen leg,

0:42:22.300,0:42:29.120
or even to do any bad thing to anybody, but with that knowledge that he was a native doctor;

0:42:29.120,0:42:35.220
anything that happened - even if somebody hit his leg on a stone, passing near our house,

0:42:35.220,0:42:39.280
he would say that my father was guilty of it.

0:42:39.280,0:42:45.940
Last Sunday, the man of God prophesied to your father, and he was eventually delivered.

0:42:45.940,0:42:48.820
How does this make you feel, as a son?

0:42:48.820,0:42:51.100
Last Sunday, I was very happy.

0:42:51.100,0:42:54.720
I was glued to Emmanuel TV last Sunday, because I knew he was there.

0:42:54.720,0:42:55.820
So, you watched the prophecy?

0:42:55.820,0:42:58.120
I watched the prophecy.

0:42:58.120,0:43:03.900
I was watching it live on YouTube.

0:43:03.900,0:43:09.300
I saw when the prophecy was spoken, and I saw him coming out to confirm it.

0:43:09.300,0:43:15.020
I was very happy that he has been arrested, not like he was arrested the other time,

0:43:15.020,0:43:17.740
with hands and feet in handcuffs.

0:43:17.740,0:43:22.960
Now, it was God that arrested him, and this one is the correct arrest.

0:43:30.820,0:43:33.360
Amen!

0:43:33.360,0:43:39.580
You mean that every now and then, the police would come, arrest him, put handcuffs on his hands and legs,

0:43:39.580,0:43:43.480
but this time around, it was the Holy Spirit that arrested him, and this one is the correct arrest?

0:43:43.480,0:43:48.100
This one is the original arrest; not the one they would carry him and put him inside the boot.

0:43:48.100,0:43:50.220
There is a mark on my hand here.

0:43:50.220,0:43:58.120
The last time they came to arrest him; one "drug officer", he used his gun on my hand,

0:43:58.120,0:44:01.020
because I asked him to take it easy with my father

0:44:01.020,0:44:06.820
because I could not stay there and watch him beating up my father.

0:44:06.820,0:44:16.040
I have this spirit of anger; anytime I see somebody making me angry, I can even... God.

0:44:16.040,0:44:23.080
So, since after your father's deliverance, can you tell us the changes you have noticed in your dad?

0:44:23.080,0:44:27.740
Yes. He was a chain smoker; he doesn't smoke anymore.

0:44:27.740,0:44:33.820
All this incense, candles - we went to the village to capture some of them in the shrine.

0:44:33.820,0:44:44.420
We have destroyed it; we just scattered everything because it was only a structure to deceive people.

0:44:44.420,0:44:50.380
We burned it; all those things that were shown in the clip - we scattered it and threw it away.

0:44:50.380,0:44:53.520
He said that we should leave something for "historical purpose".

0:44:53.520,0:44:58.160
I told him, "This one for historical purpose? Don't worry. Go outside and come back.

0:44:58.160,0:45:03.320
You will know if you still see this thing inside here."

0:45:03.320,0:45:06.380
Thank you. Let us clap for Jesus Christ!

OK, tell us; where is this place, sir.

0:45:14.160,0:45:17.800
This is in our home town in Imo State.

0:45:17.800,0:45:19.040
Is that the shrine?

0:45:19.040,0:45:20.300
Yes, that's the shrine.

0:45:20.300,0:45:26.800
As you can see this thing; I'm the person who burnt it down, but we didn't capture the fire.

0:45:26.800,0:45:32.620
We just captured this one to show an evidence of him being a witch doctor.

0:45:32.620,0:45:36.100
He had a shrine - both at home and abroad.

0:45:36.100,0:45:42.140
This one is at home, and there is another one in Enugu.

0:45:42.140,0:45:56.080
Any place he went to, he would just sit and look for an item, to make a portable, mobile shrine.

0:46:01.400,0:46:04.940
We can see you wearing a red garment.

0:46:04.940,0:46:12.540
What does that symbolize as a witch doctor, and what other colours symbolize?

0:46:12.540,0:46:15.180
You said you had garments of different colours.

0:46:15.180,0:46:18.640
Yes. I have garments of different colours.

0:46:18.640,0:46:24.380
This red you see, that is the one I used for invoking spirits.

0:46:24.380,0:46:29.660
I have blue, white and green.

0:46:29.660,0:46:34.340
I used them for different purposes, as that spirit demanded.

0:46:34.340,0:46:36.200
OK.

0:46:36.200,0:46:37.200
Can we hear from our brother?

0:46:37.200,0:46:42.680
Now, that your father is delivered, and looking at the experience you've passed through,

0:46:42.680,0:46:47.300
and today God Almighty has located and liberated this family;

0:46:47.300,0:46:51.420
what word of advice do you have for people who are listening all over the world?

0:46:51.420,0:46:58.340
My word of advice to youth like me is that they should endeavour to keep calm with their family.

0:46:58.340,0:47:05.060
No matter the situation on the ground, they should endeavour to keep calm, because if I didn't keep calm...

0:47:05.060,0:47:10.540
There was a time I even decided to run away from home because of all this crisis and trouble.

0:47:10.540,0:47:17.980
Every day, there had to be a trouble; even on Sunday, there must be a trouble.

0:47:17.980,0:47:20.880
Either we didn't have money to cook food to eat in our house,

0:47:20.880,0:47:25.320
or there was trouble between him and one of his clients.

0:47:25.320,0:47:34.100
My advice is that you should have patience, keep calm, and endeavour to have patience in your family.

0:47:34.100,0:47:38.260
No matter the situation on the ground, you should keep calm and pray to God.

0:47:38.260,0:47:42.540
I'm not a praying type, I didn't use to follow my mother to pray in the morning,

0:47:42.540,0:47:50.980
but ever since God liberated my family, I have started joining them in prayers, everything.

Thank you.

0:47:55.760,0:48:02.240
Because of time, can we listen to the last born of the house?

0:48:02.240,0:48:04.380
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:48:04.380,0:48:06.940
People of God, Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:48:06.940,0:48:10.700
My name is Meshach.

0:48:10.700,0:48:12.820
The man beside me is my father.

0:48:12.820,0:48:15.880
The lady beside him is my mother, and my elder brother.

0:48:15.880,0:48:16.900
How old are you?

0:48:16.900,0:48:18.360
I'm 11 years old.

0:48:18.360,0:48:19.520
11.

0:48:19.520,0:48:24.820
I have something to say about the native doctor.

0:48:24.820,0:48:30.460
About the native doctor: in the night, he would start doing incantations - we would not sleep.

0:48:30.460,0:48:33.180
We would not sleep in the night; he would be doing incantations.

0:48:33.180,0:48:38.800
We would see a candle like a dog; he would tell you that it is a "dog-candle" that he uses to pray with.

0:48:38.800,0:48:42.560
We would see all types of incense, many types of smell.

0:48:42.560,0:48:46.720
Every time the police would come to our house and tie his hands and legs.

0:48:46.720,0:48:53.140
They would throw him into the car like a ball; he would bounce there.

0:48:53.140,0:48:55.240
He did this "orthodox medicine".

0:48:55.240,0:49:03.300
When somebody was sick, he would come to our house and tell my father, "I'm sick. I need you to heal me."

0:49:03.300,0:49:07.600
Maybe the person was having arthritis in the leg.

0:49:07.600,0:49:15.000
My father would bring vitamin C and give to the person to drink.

0:49:15.000,0:49:18.560
The day after that, the person would come back to our house.

0:49:29.160,0:49:31.720
OK, thank you.

0:49:31.720,0:49:37.080
Tell us: you mean when your father gave them charms, medicines - some would still come back?

0:49:37.080,0:49:38.020
- Yes.
- For what?

0:49:38.020,0:49:42.160
They would come back saying that they were not healed, that the medicine was fake.

0:49:42.160,0:49:43.360
What would happen?

0:49:43.360,0:49:44.840
They would fight with my father.

0:49:44.840,0:49:48.600
Sometimes, they would call the police

0:49:48.600,0:49:54.600
and my father would be negatively accused that his drug was not working.

0:49:54.600,0:50:02.520
How did this lifestyle of your father affect you in school and in the neighbourhood?

0:50:02.520,0:50:06.340
It affected me in the school, because I could not talk in the class.

0:50:06.340,0:50:12.280
If I took the first position, because I was intelligent in my class

0:50:12.280,0:50:17.640
they would say that my father prepared a charm for me and that was why I took the first position.

0:50:17.640,0:50:22.820
Was your father giving any of you charms for school?

0:50:22.820,0:50:26.020
No. When it came to that, this thing did not work.

0:50:26.020,0:50:30.840
It was just to deceive people.

0:50:30.840,0:50:33.120
So, you guys are just naturally intelligent?

0:50:33.120,0:50:35.360
Yes, we are just naturally intelligent.

0:50:35.360,0:50:40.160
His medicine was just to deceive people, that he was a native doctor.

0:50:40.160,0:50:48.440
Sometimes, he would buy a small key and soak it in the paint, and say it is blood...

0:50:48.440,0:50:50.440
He would soak the key in the paint?

0:50:50.440,0:50:51.320
In a red paint.

0:50:51.320,0:50:54.220
And he would make people believe that it was blood?

0:50:54.220,0:50:55.580
Blood.

0:50:55.580,0:51:01.560
He would use a small rope and tie it with the feather of a hen, and would say that it was medicine,

0:51:01.560,0:51:04.020
"Take it, it will protect you."

0:51:04.020,0:51:11.320
When the medicine did not work, the people would come back and say,

0:51:11.320,0:51:15.520
"This medicine you gave me did not work. Why?"

0:51:15.520,0:51:17.780
They would start having problems with my father.

0:51:17.780,0:51:26.320
OK. Your father said there was a time he stopped taking this Indian hemp.

0:51:26.320,0:51:30.200
Was it true that he actually stopped taking Indian hemp at that time?

0:51:30.200,0:51:36.080
I used to see him in the bush, because I normally go to the stream every afternoon.

0:51:36.080,0:51:37.780
I will say this in Igbo.

0:51:37.780,0:51:41.440
I would see flames of smoke.

0:51:41.440,0:51:51.260
{Igbo language}

0:51:51.260,0:51:52.480
OK.

0:51:52.480,0:51:58.060
For the benefit of those of us who cannot understand Igbo language - what does that mean?

0:51:58.060,0:52:00.960
Where they cook a certain food.

0:52:00.960,0:52:02.360
OK.

0:52:02.360,0:52:07.180
So, when you got to the bush, sometimes you would see smoke coming out from somewhere,

0:52:07.180,0:52:09.340
and you would think that it was a bush that was burning?

0:52:09.340,0:52:12.100
Yes. I would go to that place and see my father smoking.

0:52:12.100,0:52:13.940
And it would be your father smoking Indian hemp?

0:52:13.940,0:52:16.180
Yes.

0:52:16.180,0:52:25.280
Then, I would ask him, "Why are you smoking? You convinced my mother that you have stopped smoking.

0:52:25.280,0:52:28.380
Why am I seeing you doing this type of act?"

0:52:28.380,0:52:33.280
He would say, "Shut up. If you tell your mother, I will beat you up."

0:52:33.280,0:52:39.540
So, you didn't like this witch doctor thing your father was doing all these years?

0:52:39.540,0:52:44.800
It brought disgrace and shame to our family; we couldn't talk.

0:52:44.800,0:52:49.720
If we talked, they would say, "Shut up. Your father is a native doctor."

0:52:49.720,0:52:54.800
Since your father got delivered last Sunday, what are the changes you have seen,

0:52:54.800,0:52:56.860
and how do you feel as a son?

0:52:56.860,0:53:01.540
The changes I have seen in my father's life; because he was a chain smoker before,

0:53:01.540,0:53:03.760
but now he is not smoking.

0:53:03.760,0:53:05.360
What about the anger?

0:53:05.360,0:53:07.920
He is not having the spirit of anger any more.

0:53:07.920,0:53:10.560
Before, he used to take offence very easily.

0:53:10.560,0:53:15.860
My mother would talk to him, "Why are you smoking?", in a very polite manner

0:53:15.860,0:53:18.260
and my father would pick offence.

0:53:18.260,0:53:21.820
Sometimes, he would beat my mother.

0:53:21.820,0:53:24.640
So now, everything is over; the family is free?

0:53:24.640,0:53:26.760
Yes.

0:53:26.760,0:53:29.460
Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!

We have heard it all.

0:53:36.280,0:53:42.660
So sir, briefly, what advice do you have for people listening to your testimony today?

0:53:42.660,0:53:48.200
Thank God; it is over, you have been liberated, and there are many people who are still in this bondage

0:53:48.200,0:53:59.700
of deceiving people, having been deceived by satan with fake powers of charms, medicines and whatever.

0:53:59.700,0:54:03.740
What advice do you have for such people, who are listening to you now?

0:54:03.740,0:54:06.620
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:54:06.620,0:54:13.140
My first advice is that people should trust in God.

0:54:13.140,0:54:18.600
Anything demon gives to you is not permanent.

0:54:18.600,0:54:26.000
Demon has power - true, but God's power is more than demon's power.

0:54:26.000,0:54:32.760
People, listen to me: money is not washed or invoked - central bank prints money.

0:54:32.760,0:54:38.900
Anybody who tells you that he will wash money for you, or print money for you is deceiving you.

0:54:38.900,0:54:47.480
Anywhere you hear a strange voice and they tell you that it is the voice of a spirit - it is fallacy and lies.

0:54:47.480,0:54:52.280
Spirits cannot talk; it is a human being that is talking.

0:54:57.400,0:55:00.720
So people should not allow themselves to be deceived anymore?

0:55:00.720,0:55:04.400
Yes, don't allow yourself to be deceived; it is a fake power.

0:55:04.400,0:55:11.800
And those who are still yielding themselves to demons to use as witch doctors, priests and others;

0:55:11.800,0:55:14.380
what advice you have for them?

0:55:14.380,0:55:19.640
They should think twice before they get into the same problem that I had.

0:55:19.640,0:55:25.180
They should think twice - there is no way there at all.

0:55:25.180,0:55:26.340
Glory be to God in the highest!

0:55:26.340,0:55:31.780
Once again, let's clap for Jesus Christ!

0:55:31.780,0:55:33.560
We thank God for everything.

0:55:33.560,0:55:39.520
Now that it is over, you have to turn your life over to Jesus;

0:55:39.520,0:55:45.960
He is your Lord, Saviour, Redeemer; all power belongs to Him.

0:55:45.960,0:55:49.340
Make His Word the standard for your life.

0:55:49.340,0:55:54.640
For those who are delivered by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.

0:55:54.640,0:55:59.000
We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make the Word of God

0:55:59.000,0:56:02.440
the standard for your life, and also for your family.

0:56:02.440,0:56:06.600
We believe that soon you are coming back with the deliverance you have received

0:56:06.600,0:56:12.060
with greater testimonies of open doors and breakthrough in your life and your family, in Jesus' name!

0:56:12.060,0:56:13.200
Amen!

0:56:13.200,0:56:17.620
Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:56:17.620,0:56:22.880
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:56:22.880,0:56:26.920
My name is Mr Anayo Umumakwe.

0:56:26.920,0:56:30.640
I'm from Imo State originally, but I reside in Enugu State.

0:56:30.640,0:56:33.540
This is my humble and supportive wife,

0:56:33.540,0:56:35.840
this is my third son,

0:56:35.840,0:56:37.220
this is my last born.

0:56:37.220,0:56:39.900
The first two children are not here with us.

0:56:39.900,0:56:45.020
On Sunday last week, I was in the service, when the man of God prophesied and located me.

0:56:45.020,0:56:50.740
He said that there was a witch doctor in this place and he should come out.

0:56:50.740,0:56:57.700
The moment he gave that prophecy, something just hit my mind that he was talking to me.

0:56:57.700,0:57:08.620
I was sceptical; I didn't want to come out, but at that moment my two legs started shaking.

0:57:08.620,0:57:13.780
When I moved my left leg, the right one followed it; so I came out.

0:57:13.780,0:57:17.840
That was where my deliverance started.

0:57:17.840,0:57:22.000
Since that Sunday, the man of God has been taking care of me; he gave me money

0:57:22.000,0:57:25.740
to go and bring my family from the East, from Enugu, and I brought them.

0:57:25.740,0:57:31.500
Since then he has been taking care of us - our feeding, our lodging and other logistics.

0:57:31.500,0:57:40.540
I'm very grateful to God; I want to thank Him so much for delivering me from this long-lasting problem.

0:57:40.540,0:57:41.460
I'm very very happy.

0:57:41.460,0:57:48.120
Now, I feel happy and light, I will not go back to it; no condition will take me back to that.

0:57:48.120,0:57:49.680
I will no longer do it.

0:57:49.680,0:57:51.760
I thank Jesus for my deliverance.

0:57:51.760,0:57:54.720
People of God - Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:57:54.720,0:57:58.760
The prophecy that the man of God gave to my husband is 100% true.

0:57:58.760,0:57:59.940
I'm happy.

0:57:59.940,0:58:06.980
Since ever he prophesied to him and he was delivered, I'm very very happy.

0:58:06.980,0:58:15.960
He has been a changed man and nothing can drag him to that satanic work again.

0:58:15.960,0:58:18.360
I thank God for his deliverance.

0:58:18.360,0:58:21.020
I thank the man of God for delivering him,

0:58:21.020,0:58:25.040
for humbling himself for God to use him to deliver my husband.

0:58:25.040,0:58:26.540
I'm happy about it.

0:58:26.540,0:58:29.040
Thank You, Jesus.
Thank You, Lord.

0:58:29.040,0:58:33.200
My name is Nakwe.

0:58:33.200,0:58:38.520
The woman next to me is my mother, and the man is my father.

0:58:38.520,0:58:42.060
It happened on Sunday, when the man of God gave him a Word of prophecy

0:58:42.060,0:58:45.100
that he was a witch doctor which I confirm to be true.

0:58:45.100,0:58:47.780
I'm happy now that he has been delivered.

0:58:47.780,0:58:52.540
Ever since he was delivered, he hasn't gone back to any of the characters,

0:58:52.540,0:58:55.440
or any of the attributes of a witch doctor again.

0:58:55.440,0:58:58.400
He hasn't been smoking since then, and I thank God for his life.

0:58:58.400,0:59:01.780
Thank You, Jesus, for delivering my father.

0:59:01.780,0:59:04.440
My name is Master Umumakwe.

0:59:04.440,0:59:06.640
I'm from Imo State.

0:59:06.640,0:59:11.080
I confirm the prophecy to be true; he has been a new man, since he was delivered.

0:59:11.080,0:59:14.320
He has not gone back to the bad life he was living before.

0:59:14.320,0:59:18.840
Thank You, Jesus, for delivering my father.

0:59:18.840,0:59:25.860
My advice goes especially to my partners, those who do the same business I was doing.

0:59:25.860,0:59:30.000
I want to advise them that there is no route, no light that way.

0:59:30.000,0:59:32.880
There is life, full life in the Lord, Jesus Christ.

0:59:32.880,0:59:39.640
They should endeavour to have their own deliverance and live according to the Word of God.

0:59:39.640,0:59:40.640
This is my advice to them.

0:59:40.640,0:59:49.700
Then, to people: they should not be eager to get money by all means

0:59:49.700,0:59:54.660
because what one needs is what people will use to dupe you.

0:59:54.660,1:00:00.480
When you are too eager to get anything by all means, that is when you fall into bad people's hands.

1:00:00.480,1:00:03.120
That is my advice.

1:00:03.120,1:00:05.580
Sir, we thank you for that wonderful advice.

1:00:05.580,1:00:12.260
Right now, we would like to present to you a gift from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

1:00:12.260,1:00:18.160
The man of God would like to give you the sum of 200,000 Naira

1:00:18.160,1:00:23.620
to help you to start a new life in Christ Jesus.

1:00:23.620,1:00:24.820
Thank You, Jesus.

1:00:24.820,1:00:28.400
Also a copy of "The Mirror".

1:00:28.400,1:00:33.960
These are teachings from the man of God to help you to maintain your deliverance.

1:00:33.960,1:00:35.520
Thank You, Jesus!
Thank You, Lord!

1:00:35.520,1:00:42.540
Thank You, Man of God, for helping me, delivering me and supporting me - I thank you.

1:00:42.540,1:00:44.180
Thank You, Jesus.

1:00:44.180,1:00:49.600
Sir, we want to encourage you that as you start a new life in Christ Jesus,

1:00:49.600,1:00:54.900
stay far away from your past, stay far away from sin

1:00:54.900,1:00:59.720
so that you can maintain this wonderful blessing, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

1:00:59.720,1:01:01.360
Amen!

1:01:01.360,1:01:04.740
Thank You, Jesus.
Thank You, Lord.

1:01:04.740,1:01:07.260
Thank you, Man of God. God bless you.

1:01:07.260,1:01:12.680
May God continue to strengthen you - from strength to strength,

1:01:12.680,1:01:15.880
more anointing upon anointing, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

1:01:15.880,1:01:17.000
Amen.

1:01:17.000,1:01:18.400
Thank You, Lord.
Thank You, Jesus.
