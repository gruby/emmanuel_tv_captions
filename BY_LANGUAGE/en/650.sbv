You are the reason I live

0:00:11.120,0:00:19.200
You're the One for me

0:00:19.200,0:00:26.680
Why should I fear when I have You

0:00:26.680,0:00:30.640
Surrounded by Your love

0:00:30.640,0:00:34.640
Your everlasting love

0:00:34.640,0:00:42.780
Why should I care what people say

0:00:42.780,0:00:50.820
They don't know what You mean to me

0:00:50.820,0:00:53.340
Oh, You are the reason

0:00:53.340,0:00:58.260
You are the reason I live

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:59.420,0:02:02.640
Thank you. You may be seated.

0:02:02.640,0:02:05.060
Hallelujah!

0:02:05.060,0:02:12.580
Viewers all over the world — I want to give you a salute for your faith.

0:02:12.580,0:02:14.940
Thank you for your time.

0:02:14.940,0:02:16.940
Hallelujah!

0:02:16.940,0:02:19.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:19.640,0:02:25.440
Yes, we shall go ahead as the Spirit direct.

0:02:25.440,0:02:32.140
I was with you — what a wonderful testimony

0:02:32.140,0:02:39.980
You have seen the reason to believe Jesus — He is reliable.

0:02:39.980,0:02:41.900
I say Jesus is reliable.

0:02:41.900,0:02:42.660
Amen!

0:02:42.660,0:02:44.000
I can't hear you.

0:02:44.000,0:02:45.220
Amen!

0:02:45.220,0:02:47.440
He is reliable.

0:02:47.440,0:02:49.780
I say He is reliable.

0:02:49.780,0:02:53.720
If you rely on Him, He will not disappoint you.

0:02:53.720,0:02:57.760
He will not fail you; He is not a man.

0:02:57.760,0:02:59.760
He is not a man.

0:02:59.760,0:03:01.500
He is reliable.

0:03:01.500,0:03:03.500
Hallelujah!

0:03:03.500,0:03:13.800
If you know that He is reliable, what you need to do is to confess what is in your heart.

0:03:13.800,0:03:17.520
When you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation,

0:03:17.520,0:03:25.460
when you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:03:25.460,0:03:28.200
Take your pen and write.

0:03:28.200,0:03:37.020
When you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:03:37.020,0:03:42.360
You know He is reliable. Now, it is time to believe Him.

0:03:42.360,0:03:44.460
You have seen He is reliable.

0:03:44.460,0:03:46.520
You can rely on Him.

0:03:46.520,0:03:53.140
If you know that He is reliable, it is time to confess what is in your heart.

0:03:53.140,0:04:00.300
When you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:04:00.300,0:04:05.640
It means that when you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done -

0:04:05.640,0:04:07.040
fifty-fifty.

0:04:07.040,0:04:11.120
Fifty from your side, fifty from His side.

0:04:11.120,0:04:13.540
It is not totally Him.

0:04:13.540,0:04:16.500
I know it is a strange teaching to you.

0:04:16.500,0:04:18.360
Viewers, listen again.

0:04:18.360,0:04:20.040
It is fifty-fifty.

0:04:20.040,0:04:23.080
This is why you cannot just walk in and receive.

0:04:23.080,0:04:31.160
That’s why you cannot just after you have taken drugs or groaned, receive the blessing.

0:04:31.160,0:04:33.460
Your faith is needed.

0:04:33.460,0:04:34.740
You have a role to play.

0:04:34.740,0:04:37.420
It is fifty-fifty.

0:04:37.420,0:04:39.640
How?

0:04:39.640,0:04:47.760
When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:04:47.760,0:04:48.820
Tell your neighbour:

0:04:48.820,0:04:53.040
When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:04:53.040,0:04:54.980
I can't hear you clearly.

0:04:54.980,0:05:00.560
When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:05:00.560,0:05:08.220
When you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:05:08.220,0:05:10.380
And what is the balance? Fifty.

0:05:10.380,0:05:12.820
From your own side - fifty.

0:05:12.820,0:05:18.100
His own side is there automatically.

0:05:18.100,0:05:19.120
It is available.

0:05:19.120,0:05:25.820
It is that the anointing is more than the demand.

0:05:25.820,0:05:27.600
So it is fifty-fifty.

0:05:27.600,0:05:31.940
To now confess what is in your heart is the problem.

0:05:31.940,0:05:38.880
Everything you are saying, "Jesus, Jesus" - you are just speaking with your lips.

0:05:38.880,0:05:46.040
You are not sincere.

0:05:46.040,0:05:50.240
You have not been sincere.

0:05:50.240,0:05:56.840
When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:05:56.840,0:05:59.020
That is fifty percent.

0:05:59.020,0:06:11.340
Now, the remaining fifty percent - Jesus automatically comes in to bring the balance.

0:06:11.340,0:06:15.540
It is not all up to Him; certainly it is not all up to you.

0:06:15.540,0:06:20.800
Your genuine willingness plus His ability to change.

0:06:20.800,0:06:24.420
Your genuine willingness, which is fifty percent,

0:06:24.420,0:06:28.540
His own ability to change, which is fifty percent. Fifty plus fifty.

0:06:28.540,0:06:33.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:33.140,0:06:36.380
Your genuine willingness.

0:06:36.380,0:06:40.580
Not just willingness but genuine willingness.

0:06:40.580,0:06:44.600
It must involve your future.

0:06:44.600,0:06:47.620
That what I’m saying now, I mean it for tomorrow.

0:06:47.620,0:06:50.300
What I’m saying now, I mean it for the day after tomorrow.

0:06:50.300,0:06:53.120
What I’m saying, I mean it forever.

0:06:53.120,0:06:54.940
I will follow you Jesus.

0:06:54.940,0:07:00.600
Not just today - when there’s money in the pocket and when there’s no money in the pocket.

0:07:00.600,0:07:03.900
That is, confess what is in your heart.

0:07:03.900,0:07:09.000
MESSAGE TITLE: MATCH YOUR ACTION WITH YOUR WORDS

0:07:09.000,0:07:16.360
When we say; "To confess what is in our heart", it has to do with your present and your future.

0:07:16.360,0:07:18.640
Your present - now, and your future.

0:07:18.640,0:07:20.840
This means heart.

0:07:20.840,0:07:24.140
Heart mean present, future.

0:07:24.140,0:07:29.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:29.360,0:07:32.920
Whether, in the future, there will be money in the pocket,

0:07:32.920,0:07:35.160
whether there will be no money in the pocket,

0:07:35.160,0:07:39.080
there will be food on the table or no food on the table.

0:07:39.080,0:07:44.280
That is heart.

0:07:44.280,0:07:47.140
For God to say, "A man of my own heart".

0:07:47.140,0:07:50.240
He is not only considering the present of David,

0:07:50.240,0:07:52.780
He is not considering the past of David,

0:07:52.780,0:07:56.220
but He is considering his future.

0:07:56.220,0:07:58.420
Let someone say, "A man of my own heart".

0:07:58.420,0:07:59.840
A man of my own heart.

0:07:59.840,0:08:00.740
I can’t hear you.

0:08:00.740,0:08:02.520
A man of my own heart.

0:08:02.520,0:08:05.660
So for you to know what the word heart means.

0:08:05.660,0:08:08.440
Faith is of man’s heart.

0:08:08.440,0:08:15.160
Heart mean spirit, that is your spirit.

0:08:15.160,0:08:17.780
Not literal meaning.

0:08:17.780,0:08:22.720
In your school, it is not regarded like that.

0:08:22.720,0:08:27.520
Biblically, heart is spirit of man.

0:08:27.520,0:08:30.840
You can call it heart or you can call it spirit;

0:08:30.840,0:08:40.140
you can call it faith of man’s heart or you can call it faith of man's spirit.

0:08:40.140,0:08:44.840
Heart has to do with now and next -

0:08:44.840,0:08:48.000
what you will be doing now, what you stand for now,

0:08:48.000,0:08:52.500
is what you are going to start from tomorrow.

0:08:52.500,0:08:54.540
Heart.

0:08:54.540,0:09:01.760
When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:09:01.760,0:09:02.740
Let someone say that.

0:09:02.740,0:09:08.020
When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:09:08.020,0:09:10.060
If you stand before me and say,

0:09:10.060,0:09:18.060
"T.B. Joshua, I’m not well and I’m a man of God’s heart",

0:09:18.060,0:09:24.080
that is someone who obeys God, listens to God - I will help you.

0:09:24.080,0:09:28.620
But the way you now tell me a different thing, whereas it is not that,

0:09:28.620,0:09:32.340
"T.B. Joshua, I don’t have money!" - whereas you have money.

0:09:32.340,0:09:36.380
I may likely not be able to meet your need

0:09:36.380,0:09:41.740
because you have not met the fifty percent requirement.

0:09:41.740,0:09:46.860
MESSAGE TITLE: MATCH YOUR ACTION WITH YOUR WORDS

0:09:46.860,0:09:48.300
Are you with me?

0:09:48.300,0:09:50.880
A man of my own heart.

0:09:50.880,0:09:56.680
That is, when you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.

0:09:56.680,0:10:02.840
It means that if you just confess what is in your heart – "I need bread" -

0:10:02.840,0:10:05.520
and God does not give you that bread,

0:10:05.520,0:10:08.660
yet He is aware you have no bread,

0:10:08.660,0:10:15.700
He will protect you, cover you and be with you.

0:10:15.700,0:10:18.500
Fifty percent is okay.

0:10:18.500,0:10:23.940
In a neutral meaning - in a school, when you score fifty percent, you will get a pass mark.

0:10:23.940,0:10:35.180
It means that if you now confess God and seek what is exactly in your heart,

0:10:35.180,0:10:38.960
and you do not receive that healing,

0:10:38.960,0:10:45.600
He will be with you through that trial time until you will receive.

0:10:45.600,0:10:53.080
Because he is aware you are sick.

0:10:53.080,0:10:55.740
The heart is very important

0:10:55.740,0:11:00.340
because the Bible says, "Christianity lies in the heart".

0:11:00.340,0:11:01.600
Let someone say that.

0:11:01.600,0:11:03.580
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:11:03.580,0:11:04.740
I can’t hear you.

0:11:04.740,0:11:06.540
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:11:06.540,0:11:07.600
I can’t hear you.

0:11:07.600,0:11:09.560
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:11:09.560,0:11:10.720
I can’t hear you.

0:11:10.720,0:11:12.580
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:11:12.580,0:11:18.060
Yes. Christianity lies in the heart.

0:11:18.060,0:11:26.600
If many of us had known this for a long time, you would have worked out things better than this.

0:11:26.600,0:11:32.960
If I confess what is in my heart, the job is half done, I will score fifty percent.

0:11:32.960,0:11:39.680
If you now confess what is in your heart, "Lord, I’m sick. I have a headache!"

0:11:39.680,0:11:42.980
and you do not receive healing,

0:11:42.980,0:11:50.160
He will still be with you throughout the trial of that pain until you receive.

0:11:50.160,0:11:51.340
He is aware.

0:11:51.340,0:11:55.580
When God is aware of your situation, don’t bother.

0:11:55.580,0:11:58.480
The situation cannot kill you any longer.

0:11:58.480,0:12:01.220
The situation cannot destroy you any longer.

0:12:01.220,0:12:04.500
Your struggle will make you stronger.

0:12:04.500,0:12:07.700
It will not impair you but improve you.

0:12:07.700,0:12:15.120
The words — confess what is in your heart — mean: Match your action with your words.

0:12:15.120,0:12:16.320
Let someone say that.

0:12:16.320,0:12:18.920
Match your action with your words.

0:12:18.920,0:12:21.640
Match your action –

0:12:21.640,0:12:25.680
that is, what you are saying is what you are doing.

0:12:25.680,0:12:30.420
What you are saying is what you are doing.

0:12:30.420,0:12:33.740
It means that your words match with your action.

0:12:33.740,0:12:46.440
Match your action with your words means to confess what is in your heart.

0:12:46.440,0:12:49.700
What you are saying is what you are doing.

0:12:49.700,0:12:52.320
To summarise my message today:

0:12:52.320,0:12:59.660
Match your action with your words means to confess what is in your heart -

0:12:59.660,0:13:03.100
the job is half done.

0:13:03.100,0:13:07.700
Then, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:13:07.700,0:13:13.780
What is the balance? Fifty percent.

0:13:13.780,0:13:15.660
Let me talk to the viewers.

0:13:15.660,0:13:17.340
Sometimes, they want me to talk to them.

0:13:17.340,0:13:19.940
They want me to face them.

0:13:19.940,0:13:22.820
All what I’m saying now, somebody would say, "Face us!

0:13:22.820,0:13:25.520
You are talking to your people here. Face us!"

0:13:25.520,0:13:28.520
Now I want to face you to tell you what I am talking about.

0:13:28.520,0:13:30.300
Viewers, thank you very much.

0:13:30.300,0:13:33.020
I don’t know the position you are in

0:13:33.020,0:13:36.260
and whatever situation you are facing - Jesus knows better.

0:13:36.260,0:13:40.220
I want to tell you right now - this is a revelation for you.

0:13:40.220,0:13:43.420
Some of us didn't know about this in the past.

0:13:43.420,0:13:47.280
But revelation is ahead of us.

0:13:47.280,0:13:50.160
We are here, revelation is there.

0:13:50.160,0:13:54.140
We have to look into revelation to receive.

0:13:54.140,0:13:57.120
Speak what is in your heart.

0:13:57.120,0:14:03.300
Like I have said in my message that faith is of man’s heart.

0:14:03.300,0:14:08.000
When we say, faith is of man’s heart, we mean faith is of man’s spirit.

0:14:08.000,0:14:11.820
When you say heart, you mean spirit.

0:14:11.820,0:14:19.500
Speak what is in your heart - the job is half done.

0:14:19.500,0:14:40.420
When you speak what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:14:40.420,0:14:44.300
If you still haven't received that thing, it means Jesus is aware of your situation.

0:14:44.300,0:14:48.000
When Jesus is aware, it is like He has solved your problem.

0:14:48.000,0:14:53.600
There is no difference between Jesus being aware of your situation and solving your problem.

0:14:53.600,0:14:58.260
Solving your problem and being aware of your problem is the same.

0:14:58.260,0:15:04.860
If I have leg pain and I run to Jesus, "Help me! Help me!"

0:15:04.860,0:15:06.720
and Jesus says, "I will help you!",

0:15:06.720,0:15:12.000
He is aware of my leg pain. It is as good as helping me.

0:15:12.000,0:15:16.540
If He is aware of my leg pain and He has not helped me,

0:15:16.540,0:15:20.700
He has not healed me and I still have that leg pain but He is aware -

0:15:20.700,0:15:23.240
it is as good as helping me.

0:15:23.240,0:15:28.860
If He is aware of your situation, your situation becomes His situation:

0:15:28.860,0:15:31.420
Your pain becomes His pain.

0:15:31.420,0:15:37.040
By His stripes, He helps and delivers us.

0:15:37.040,0:15:41.940
Viewers, speak what is in your heart.

0:15:41.940,0:15:43.780
Speak what is in your heart.

0:15:43.780,0:15:50.620
When you speak what is in your heart and say, "Jesus", He comes to the scene immediately -

0:15:50.620,0:15:52.800
instantly, He comes to the scene.

0:15:52.800,0:15:56.240
This is the revelation for us today.

0:15:56.240,0:15:57.680
You just write it down

0:15:57.680,0:16:02.220
This is what we mean by "Match your action with your words".

0:16:02.220,0:16:06.840
Match your action with your words.

0:16:06.840,0:16:09.900
What you say should be what you are doing.

0:16:09.900,0:16:11.600
Thank you. God bless you.

0:16:11.600,0:16:13.200
Hallelujah.
