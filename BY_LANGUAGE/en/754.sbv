0:00:00.000,0:00:03.680
There was no way for Moses,

0:00:04.960,0:00:07.780
if the Red Sea was not divided

0:00:08.600,0:00:09.640
Are you with me?

0:00:10.480,0:00:16.400
There was no way for Moses, if the Red sea was not divided.

0:00:17.120,0:00:18.960
Moses was at the cross roads

0:00:19.800,0:00:21.520
He looked here; he looked there,there was no way.

0:00:21.660,0:00:24.840
the only way was just to cross the Red sea.

0:00:26.700,0:00:29.540
In the same way, many of you are in the crossroads

0:00:29.540,0:00:30.440
There is no way

0:00:37.900,0:00:43.980
In any area of your life,that you find difficulty to penetrate

0:00:45.640,0:00:59.500
I want you to raise your prayer mantle; prayer sword and begin to part and divide

0:01:00.720,0:01:02.640
And make way where there is no way

Are you ready with me?

0:01:04.580,0:01:05.300

0:01:07.220,0:01:07.860
I cant hear you?

0:01:08.760,0:01:09.260
YES!

0:01:09.820,0:01:11.900
You know your prayer has a sword

0:01:11.900,0:01:20.620
when you raise the voice, confession of The Holy Spirit it is a sword, a weapon

0:01:21.260,0:01:24.920
That can divide and make a way where there is no way

0:01:25.640,0:01:27.240
You just need this Word.

0:01:28.080,0:01:33.240
And I am going to anoint your word; every word you are going to speak am going to anoint it.

0:01:35.420,0:01:40.620
Every word you are going to speak at this moment; be anointed in the name of Jesus

When your word is anointed, you can divide and make a way where there is no way in your business.

0:02:00.080,0:02:03.280
And make a way where there is no way in your career.

0:02:03.280,0:02:04.040

0:02:55.520,0:02:56.020
AMEN!

0:02:58.320,0:03:04.000
Because you don't believe in yourself and you don't believe you can part- you can divide

0:03:04.480,0:03:06.920
You don't believe you can walk with your word

0:03:06.920,0:03:09.680
You don't believe you can open with your word
