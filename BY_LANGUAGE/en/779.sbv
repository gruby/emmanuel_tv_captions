0:01:15.360,0:01:16.860
From YouTube:

0:01:16.860,0:01:21.260
You've just done something very few YouTube creators accomplish:

0:01:21.260,0:01:26.440
You had an astonishing 100,000 people subscribe to your channel.

0:01:26.440,0:01:29.160
We know numbers on YouTube can get really big,

0:01:29.160,0:01:34.860
but we hope you don't lose sight of the reality behind that six-digit milestone.

0:01:34.860,0:01:39.880
Each and every person who has subscribed to your channel was touched by what you did.

0:01:39.880,0:01:43.400
They were inspired or challenged or entertained.

0:01:43.400,0:01:46.560
You made it to this milestone with hard work, perseverance,

0:01:46.560,0:01:49.620
and - chances are - a healthy sense of humor.

0:01:49.620,0:01:52.620

0:01:52.620,0:01:57.500

Believe us when we say that we can't wait to see what you do next.

0:02:14.040,0:02:18.960
