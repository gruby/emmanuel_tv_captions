Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:10.900,0:00:14.380
I know God has an assignment for me.

0:00:14.380,0:00:18.940
When I was coming I kept asking God, what was I going to do?

0:00:18.940,0:00:21.680
I didn't know what I was coming to do.

0:00:21.680,0:00:26.560
At this time the Lord said to continue to go.

0:00:26.560,0:00:32.100
I'm here Lord, I'm waiting for my assignments.

0:00:32.100,0:00:42.720
Viewers all over the world, I believe God has positioned you because if you are positioned you receive.

0:00:42.720,0:00:45.680
First you need to be positioned.

0:00:45.680,0:00:48.240
I believe you are positioned.

0:00:48.240,0:00:49.300
(Amen.)

0:00:49.300,0:01:00.480
Say, “I have been positioned for healing, deliverance, salvation and prosperity.

0:01:00.480,0:01:05.060
I have been positioned. Thank You, Jesus!”

0:01:05.060,0:01:08.540
That is the first thing.

0:01:08.540,0:01:13.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:13.240,0:01:23.600
I was asking God to give me the Bible verses and the one He directed me to...

0:01:23.600,0:01:28.120
I was asking God - this one is talking about the treasure in the church.

0:01:28.120,0:01:34.920
He said: No, that treasure in the church means the needy.

0:01:34.920,0:01:47.480
So, we take our reading from that Book of Mark 12 verse 41.

0:01:47.480,0:01:51.660
The widow's offering.

0:01:51.660,0:01:55.360
Are you here?

0:01:55.360,0:02:02.020
"Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put

0:02:02.020,0:02:13.660
and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.

0:02:13.660,0:02:19.360
Many rich people threw in large amounts.

0:02:19.360,0:02:31.040
But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents."

0:02:31.040,0:02:38.160
You know what copper coins mean - worth only a few cents.

0:02:38.160,0:02:42.500
"Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,

0:02:42.500,0:02:56.540
'Truly I tell you this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.

0:02:56.540,0:03:00.480
They all gave out of their wealth;

0:03:00.480,0:03:12.300
but she, out of her poverty, put in everything - all she had to live on'."

0:03:12.300,0:03:16.700
I will call this an assignment from God.

0:03:16.700,0:03:21.400
This is an assignment from God to you.

0:03:21.400,0:03:33.060
Today, we all believe we can only give out of abundance.

0:03:33.060,0:03:45.060
Ask the poor widow and she will tell you that everyone has something to give.

0:03:45.060,0:03:53.180
Big or small, everyone has something to give.

0:03:53.180,0:04:03.800
In things both great and small, everyone has something to give.

0:04:03.800,0:04:10.860
Jesus cares so much about little things.

0:04:10.860,0:04:12.460
Tell your neighbour.

0:04:12.460,0:04:15.820
(Jesus cares so much about little things.)

0:04:15.820,0:04:17.360
I can't hear you

0:04:17.360,0:04:20.260
(Jesus cares so much about little things.)

0:04:20.260,0:04:33.340
He cares so much about your cent, your penny

0:04:33.340,0:04:47.720
He knows the number of hairs on our heads and He cares for a single sparrow that falls.

0:04:47.720,0:05:07.560
It is quite easy to give what our life depends on, what we cherish most, with little than when we have much.

0:05:07.560,0:05:16.680
When you have little, it is easy to give.

0:05:16.680,0:05:35.800
Whatever you give out of little means a lot to you and attracts God's attention.

0:05:35.800,0:05:41.740
Good example: you have just 5 dollars.

0:05:41.740,0:05:55.280
Whatever you give out of that 5 dollars means a lot to you and attracts God's attention.

0:05:55.280,0:05:58.660
More than giving a million dollars.

0:05:58.660,0:06:08.760
If you had one million dollars, you wouldn't know how much of it to give.

0:06:08.760,0:06:16.920
One million dollars is one million responsibilities.

0:06:16.920,0:06:24.660
If you don't know how much you need God in small things,

0:06:24.660,0:06:31.820
you cannot know how much you need Him in bigger things.

0:06:31.820,0:06:36.000
You don't know how much you need God to sit down.

0:06:36.000,0:06:42.280
When you want to sit down, you believe you can sit down without God.

0:06:42.280,0:06:44.800
This is the problem of all of us have today.

0:06:44.800,0:06:47.500
When you want to sit, you just sit down.

0:06:47.500,0:06:53.000
Not a single person can stand up to tell me:  "Before I sit down, I rely on God's strength".

0:06:53.000,0:06:56.680
"In the name of Jesus", before I sit down - no.

0:06:56.680,0:06:59.760
You believe you can do that on your own.

0:06:59.760,0:07:04.020
If you don't know how much you need God in small things,

0:07:04.020,0:07:10.100
you will not know how much you need Him in bigger things.

0:07:10.100,0:07:14.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:14.740,0:07:19.600
You don't know how much you need God to laugh.

0:07:19.600,0:07:25.900
You will not know how much you need God to set you up from affliction.

0:07:25.900,0:07:30.660
So, you believe you can sit on your own, you don't need Him to sit,

0:07:30.660,0:07:34.860
you don't need Him to stand, you don't even need Him to laugh, you don't need Him to walk -

0:07:34.860,0:07:39.080
you walk freely on your own, you talk freely on your own

0:07:39.080,0:07:45.260
but when trouble comes, you say: "God, I need you. God heal me. God bless me."

0:07:45.260,0:08:04.320
God is constantly putting us to the test in the small things.

0:08:04.320,0:08:19.840
If you fail to bless others with the little blessing God has given to you, more may never come.

0:08:19.840,0:08:33.080
If you fail to appreciate God with the little blessing you have, more may never come

0:08:33.080,0:08:37.520
because if you don't appreciate Him in the little things,

0:08:37.520,0:08:45.680
you may not know how to appreciate Him in the bigger things.

0:08:45.680,0:09:06.020
It is easy to give God our quality time when we are nobody.

0:09:06.020,0:09:11.960
Quality time means there's no time that you cannot give God.

0:09:11.960,0:09:16.120
When you are nobody...

0:09:16.120,0:09:24.040
It is easy to give quality strength when we are nobody.

0:09:24.040,0:09:32.680
So, in the same vein, it is easy to give what our lives depend on, what we cherish most

0:09:32.680,0:09:41.220
when we're nobody than when we are somebody.

0:09:41.220,0:09:52.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:52.100,0:10:03.380
At your level now, you cannot give your quality time, what your life depends on what you cherish most -

0:10:03.380,0:10:06.400
the best of you.

0:10:06.400,0:10:10.000
When will you give your best?

0:10:10.000,0:10:18.160
When you become more important...

0:10:18.160,0:10:23.320
That time may never come.

0:10:23.320,0:10:28.020
That is what Jesus was talking about.

0:10:28.020,0:10:33.060
He said, "Look at the poor widow giving what her life depends on".

0:10:33.060,0:10:44.160
It does not mean we have to give all, but the little we part out of a little means much

0:10:44.160,0:10:51.760
and attracts God's attention.

0:10:51.760,0:10:56.200
She had little and she parted with little out of the little.

0:10:56.200,0:10:59.360
But out of abundance...

0:10:59.360,0:11:12.360
You know the reaction of the rich man, when he was asked to sell all his possessions.

0:11:12.360,0:11:17.680
He said he did not know where to start from.

0:11:17.680,0:11:24.140
"I don't know where to start from."

0:11:24.140,0:11:43.880
If you don't know how much you need God to talk, walk, smile, greet, dress up,

0:11:43.880,0:11:52.760
you will always have a certain occasion for prayer.

0:11:52.760,0:11:55.640
Because you believe you don't need God to walk.

0:11:55.640,0:11:58.860
That is why you have a certain occasion for prayer.

0:11:58.860,0:12:03.900
You believe you don't need God to sit - that is why you have such an occasion for prayer.

0:12:03.900,0:12:10.580
You believe you don't need God to dress up - that's why you have a certain occasion for prayer.

0:12:10.580,0:12:19.260
And a break in prayer is a break in faith and a break in faith is a break with God.

0:12:19.260,0:12:29.720
We don't know how much we need God; that is why we have certain occasions for prayer.

0:12:29.720,0:12:32.920
When you know how much you need God -

0:12:32.920,0:12:42.480
the Bible says, 'Pray without ceasing, pray continuously'.

0:12:42.480,0:12:52.000
When you know you need God to walk, talk, greet, sit, dress up,

0:12:52.000,0:12:56.460
you will not have a certain occasion for prayer -

0:12:56.460,0:13:04.780
prayer all the time; prayer without ceasing.

0:13:04.780,0:13:22.180
Your life, success, happiness, progress, depend on your willingness to help others.

0:13:22.180,0:13:28.100
Your progress in life - I mean your happiness and joy

0:13:28.100,0:13:30.680
depends on what?

0:13:30.680,0:13:34.240
Your genuine willingness to do what?

0:13:34.240,0:13:35.820
(To help others.)

0:13:35.820,0:13:49.440
To help others - to help the poor, needy.

0:13:49.440,0:14:00.700
How much you help the poor is how much you progress.

0:14:00.700,0:14:06.360
How much you help the needy is how much you succeed.

0:14:06.360,0:14:16.080
If you say you have little, more may never come;

0:14:16.080,0:14:24.060
it's too little to part with, it's too little to give out of,  more may never come.

0:14:24.060,0:14:29.460
God cares so much about little things.

0:14:29.460,0:14:30.720
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:30.720,0:14:33.600
(God cares so much about little things.)

0:14:33.600,0:14:35.240
He cares so much...

0:14:35.240,0:14:40.700
That is why he was watching the poor widow.

0:14:40.700,0:14:47.160
Instead of looking at the rich, He decided to watch the poor widow.

0:14:47.160,0:14:56.700
He cares so much about little things, how we manage little things.

0:14:56.700,0:14:57.720
Tell your neighbour.

0:14:57.720,0:15:00.120
(He cares so much about little things, how we manage little things.)

0:15:00.120,0:15:01.400
I can't hear you

0:15:01.400,0:15:03.100
(He cares so much about little things, how we manage little things.)

0:15:03.100,0:15:11.560
How you manage your little possessions, how you manage your little money.

0:15:11.560,0:15:21.860
He cares so much because more may never come.

0:15:21.860,0:15:24.580
Tell your neighbor.

0:15:24.580,0:15:30.340
I can't hear you.

0:15:30.340,0:15:39.280
He cares so much and is concerned about us.

0:15:39.280,0:15:52.260
Oh, my people, it is easier to part with little than much.

0:15:52.260,0:16:06.840
Tell your neighbor: "Oh, my people, it is easier to part with little than much."

0:16:06.840,0:16:11.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:11.100,0:16:13.340
Take note of that.

0:16:13.340,0:16:19.500
You say, "I have little...".

0:16:19.500,0:16:23.580
Oh, this is a message from God to you.

0:16:23.580,0:16:30.580
For you to have peace, you need to be concerned about people around you.

0:16:30.580,0:16:38.880
Your life depends on your willingness to help.

0:16:38.880,0:16:49.560
Your joy and happiness depend on your willingness to bless others.

0:16:49.560,0:16:54.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:54.940,0:17:12.040
Take your pen and write this: "God cares so much about little things - little possessions, little money."

0:17:12.040,0:17:13.680
What you call "little money"?

0:17:13.680,0:17:19.280
"Little money" is just enough for your daily bread for your family.

0:17:19.280,0:17:30.260
That little - how you manage it; because more may never come.

0:17:30.260,0:17:38.540
That is why some people remain poor till now and keep complaining -

0:17:38.540,0:17:44.040
because of the way they manage the little they have.

0:17:44.040,0:17:53.480
Take note of many families or people you knew in the past - they remain poor or they get poorer.

0:17:53.480,0:18:03.000
You look at them - they keep complaining about being poor and they keep getting poorer.

0:18:03.000,0:18:06.540
This affects the children.

0:18:06.540,0:18:16.560
Many families live this way - many of them have to give their children up for adoption.

0:18:16.560,0:18:19.940
They see slavery because of poverty.

0:18:19.940,0:18:27.240
Tell your neighbour: "They see slavery because of poverty".

0:18:27.240,0:18:40.360
"I have just little, that was given to me" - God is concerned about that little so much

0:18:40.360,0:18:44.940
because more may never come.

0:18:44.940,0:18:47.820
Why God is concerned about that little?

0:18:47.820,0:18:54.100
Because more may never come - that is why He is concerned.

0:18:54.100,0:18:58.320
This little - more may never come.

0:18:58.320,0:19:05.700
For more to come, you have to be ready to part.

0:19:05.700,0:19:09.460
Help the needy, help the poor.

0:19:09.460,0:19:14.380
If you say you are poor, there are others that are poorer.

0:19:14.380,0:19:17.740
We always have people that have less than us.

0:19:17.740,0:19:26.320
If you say "I'm very poor", you will always see poorer than you.

0:19:26.320,0:19:30.080
There are always people that have less than us.

0:19:30.080,0:19:35.560
Yes, if I'm talking to you ,let me see your hand.

0:19:35.560,0:19:37.080
Always.

0:19:37.080,0:19:45.160
When you say, "I'm very poor" - when you look, you will always find someone poorer.

0:19:45.160,0:19:52.920
If you say you are very sick, when you look around, you will see one that is more sick.

0:19:52.920,0:19:59.660
Someone is always there who needs what you have.

0:19:59.660,0:20:09.180
Tell your neighbor:  "Someone is always there who is in need of you"

0:20:09.180,0:20:18.520
God is always concerned; He wants you to grow.

0:20:18.520,0:20:24.280
There is a new day every morning - you just have to grow.

0:20:24.280,0:20:33.440
Because of how you manage your little possession, money, He is always concerned

0:20:33.440,0:20:38.500
because more may never come.

0:20:38.500,0:20:42.400
As you help, someone is there to help you.

0:20:42.400,0:20:44.820
The more you help, the more they help you.

0:20:44.820,0:20:49.960
The more you help someone who is in need of you, someone is there to help you.

0:20:49.960,0:20:54.140
Someone is waiting to help you, when you help others.

0:20:54.140,0:21:04.300
Tell your neighbour: "Someone is waiting to help you when you help someone who is in need of you

0:21:04.300,0:21:10.800
but when you remain dormant, refusing to help,

0:21:10.800,0:21:18.100
someone who is waiting to help you will also remain looking at you.

0:21:18.100,0:21:19.940
What you are looking for, someone has it.

0:21:19.940,0:21:22.760
God has sent someone to help reshape your destiny

0:21:22.760,0:21:29.860
and that someone is waiting for you to help someone who is in need of your help.

0:21:29.860,0:21:40.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:40.440,0:21:42.400
Thank you.

0:21:42.400,0:21:43.460
Bless you!

0:21:43.460,0:21:44.920
(Amen!)

0:21:44.920,0:21:55.680
So now, it is a gracious thing for you to know that someone is waiting for you, for your help.

0:21:55.680,0:21:59.500
Someone is waiting for your support.

0:21:59.500,0:22:02.640
Someone is waiting for your prayer.

0:22:02.640,0:22:07.980
Someone is waiting for what?

0:22:07.980,0:22:15.680
Can you talk to me?

0:22:15.680,0:22:23.460
You know that someone is waiting for your help and someone also is waiting to give you.

0:22:23.460,0:22:25.540
As you help, you receive.

0:22:25.540,0:22:26.520
(Amen!)

0:22:26.520,0:22:28.760
Thank you.

0:22:33.180,0:22:35.760
This is a physical structure.

0:22:35.760,0:22:40.440
You are the Church; build people!

0:22:40.440,0:22:45.640
Go and build people; don't build the churches.

0:22:45.640,0:22:48.420
This is a physical structure, a building.

0:22:48.420,0:22:52.480
You are the real Church the Bible is talking about.

0:22:52.480,0:23:00.360
Church will build you; you can build church.

0:23:00.360,0:23:09.220
They should talk more about how to build humans - manpower.

0:23:09.220,0:23:10.720
What message are you taking home?

0:23:10.720,0:23:14.340
Can somebody stand up and tell me the message you are taking home?

0:23:14.340,0:23:16.360
Brother... thank you.

0:23:16.360,0:23:19.280
Everyone has something to give.

0:23:19.280,0:23:21.620
Thank you.

0:23:21.620,0:23:24.780
If you don't know how much you need God in a small thing,

0:23:24.780,0:23:28.060
you will not know how much you need God in a bigger thing.

0:23:28.060,0:23:31.540
God cares so much about little things.

0:23:31.540,0:23:35.360
For more to come, part with them - help the needy.

0:23:35.360,0:23:40.060
Thank you. Clap for him.

0:23:40.060,0:23:42.060
Anyone else?

0:23:42.060,0:23:44.480
Two lessons I am taking with me.

0:23:44.480,0:23:52.000
First one: "God cares so much about little things".

0:23:52.000,0:23:53.960
The second one: ...

0:23:53.960,0:23:58.820
That is God cares so much about little things.

0:23:58.820,0:24:01.320
And that "little things" is an idiom.

0:24:01.320,0:24:02.560
- Yes.
- OK.

0:24:02.560,0:24:05.020
What do you understand about the "little things", sir?

0:24:05.020,0:24:07.060
It can be your possessions...

0:24:07.060,0:24:09.680
- Thank you; little possessions.
- Little possessions.

0:24:09.680,0:24:11.120
- Thank you.
- The little money you have.

0:24:11.120,0:24:15.140
Thank you; clap for him.

0:24:15.140,0:24:18.340
Did you listen to that?

0:24:18.340,0:24:22.180
God cares so much about little things.

0:24:22.180,0:24:23.380
That little means...

0:24:23.380,0:24:30.460
He is talking about average, less privileged.

0:24:30.460,0:24:33.760
What we consider as little?

0:24:33.760,0:24:37.660
Why is He so concerned about it?

0:24:37.660,0:24:42.140
Because we must manage it very well.

0:24:42.140,0:24:53.520
For this little to become big, we must be ready to give out of that just like the poor widow

0:24:53.520,0:24:58.340
because more may never come.

0:24:58.340,0:25:03.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:03.080,0:25:17.880
And it is very, very easy to give with little.

0:25:17.880,0:25:29.900
You can give a quality one with the little you have, but it is very difficult to give quality with much.

0:25:29.900,0:25:38.360
You remember the rich man, for whom it was difficult to sell his possessions.

0:25:38.360,0:25:46.080
He said he hadn't known where to start from.

0:25:46.080,0:25:49.460
Because you can only give what you do not need.

0:25:49.460,0:25:55.880
If rich men want to give, they always give what they do not need.

0:25:55.880,0:26:02.740
If you met the millionaires, the rich - if you met them...

0:26:02.740,0:26:10.200
If Jesus met them, what they would do - they would open their garages.

0:26:10.200,0:26:14.220
Things they are going to give are not those they are using now.

0:26:14.220,0:26:17.720
These are things they have packed for many years.

0:26:17.720,0:26:23.720
They are still good, but they don't need them anymore.

0:26:23.720,0:26:35.000
The rich always give what they do not need, but the poor give what their lives depend on.

0:26:35.000,0:26:43.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:43.680,0:26:46.040
You want to say something?
Come on!

0:26:46.040,0:26:54.980
One message I'm taking from here; I must know that there is always somebody who is in need of me.

0:26:54.980,0:26:57.140
... who is in need of me.

0:26:57.140,0:27:05.480
No matter how little you have, someone is in need of you.

0:27:05.480,0:27:11.580
Tell your neighbor, "No matter how little you have, someone is in need of you."

0:27:11.580,0:27:20.120
No matter how little you have, no matter how little money you have,

0:27:20.120,0:27:32.620
no matter how little possession you have, someone is in need of you.

0:27:32.620,0:27:39.780
I have also learned that we usually give quality time to God when we are nobody.

0:27:39.780,0:27:40.280
Thank you.

0:27:40.280,0:27:43.480
But when we are somebody, then we don't have quality time for God.

0:27:43.480,0:27:45.500
Did you listen to that?

0:27:45.500,0:27:47.860
When we are nobody...

0:27:47.860,0:28:00.740
When we say nobody, maybe you just see yourself belonging to your family, work place or your church.

0:28:00.740,0:28:07.720
If anything happens to you, when you are little, your church will care, your family will cry,

0:28:07.720,0:28:09.620
people at your working place will worry.

0:28:09.620,0:28:11.880
These are the people who know you.

0:28:11.880,0:28:24.340
But when you become so known all over, and you become big and famous,

0:28:24.340,0:28:39.300
it is always so difficult to give out of abundance and riches - so difficult.

0:28:39.300,0:28:43.320
Unless you have been giving when you were little...

0:28:43.320,0:28:48.800
When you give while you are little, when you become bigger,

0:28:48.800,0:28:52.040
you will continue to give according to God's instruction

0:28:52.040,0:29:00.760
but when you say, 'Until I become bigger before I will start giving', more will never come.

0:29:00.760,0:29:11.320
If God wants to promote you, He will promote you for the needs of others.

0:29:11.320,0:29:16.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:16.400,0:29:23.080
You know; there are two promotions - God's promotion and devil's promotion.

0:29:23.080,0:29:29.360
"As I have given the money, not as the world gives them."

0:29:29.360,0:29:37.640
The world can give you money, possessions, promotion but not as God gives.

0:29:37.640,0:29:41.460
God gives with peace and joy.

0:29:41.460,0:29:51.980
There are conditions attached to satanic, demonic promotion, which one will pay dearly for.

0:29:51.980,0:29:54.460
You are saved to save others.

0:29:54.460,0:29:56.900
You are blessed to bless others.

0:29:56.900,0:30:02.480
If you are not ready to bless others, there is no need to bless you.

0:30:02.480,0:30:05.660
The condition to bless you is to bless others.

0:30:05.660,0:30:09.040
If it is not in your agenda to bless others -

0:30:09.040,0:30:13.540
God knows your hearts and He knows what will happen next.

0:30:13.540,0:30:16.840
You own now and God owns tomorrow.

0:30:16.840,0:30:25.300
If God knows you will not be there for the poor and the needy, more will never come.

0:30:25.300,0:30:36.060
Tell your neighbor: "If God knows you will not be there for the needy, poor, widows and orphans,

0:30:36.060,0:30:40.460
more will never come".

0:30:40.460,0:30:43.260
Thank you, sir.
Sit down.

0:30:43.260,0:30:47.920
Take your pen and write it down - I think this is good for you.

0:30:47.920,0:31:07.020
If God knows you will not be there for the poor, orphan, widow and widower, more will never come.

0:31:07.020,0:31:12.300
That is why many of us are still struggling with our poverty and hardship.

0:31:12.300,0:31:18.960
We keep praying to be rich for many years, but yet, no blessing

0:31:18.960,0:31:21.940
because you don't part with the little you have.

0:31:21.940,0:31:26.140
If you don't know how much you need 
God in small things,

0:31:26.140,0:31:33.600
you will not be able to know how much you need Him in bigger things.

0:31:33.600,0:31:36.160
Thank you.
