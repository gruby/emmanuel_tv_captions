0:00:00.279,0:00:02.279
Can I talk to you, sir?

0:00:03.969,0:00:05.969
You are addicted to hard drugs.

0:00:06.520,0:00:08.520
 

0:00:08.950,0:00:10.809
 

0:00:10.809,0:00:12.730
 

0:00:12.730,0:00:14.730
Yes, man of God!

0:00:14.730,0:00:16.780
This is hard drugs

0:00:16.780,0:00:17.699
and you believe God can set you free.

Hard drugs - he's addicted to hard drugs.

0:00:32.760,0:00:37.190
After taking it, he hears voices everywhere; there is a spirit tormenting him.

0:00:37.739,0:00:39.510
 

0:00:39.510,0:00:44.029
I'm his sister; I brought him here and whatever you said is very true.

0:00:45.750,0:00:49.279
He has been using drugs but that has always been the problem.

0:00:50.100,0:00:52.100
I've actually tried to help him.

0:00:52.100,0:00:54.100
I've not been able to so I brought him here for help.

 A Tanzanian Living In The UK

0:01:01.410,0:01:05.630
 

0:01:06.210,0:01:11.989
 

0:01:11.990,0:01:14.990
The man of God blessed me and I felt a very light relieving feeling.

0:01:15.330,0:01:20.089
He prophesied that I am addicted to hard drugs. The prophesy is definitely true.

0:01:20.910,0:01:28.009
 

0:01:28.770,0:01:30.509
 

0:01:30.509,0:01:32.509
When I was young, things that happened at my home really stressed me out.

0:01:32.509,0:01:37.099
On top of that, my education, homework and all that just piled up on me.

0:01:37.650,0:01:39.229
Smoking was an outlet for me.

0:01:39.229,0:01:41.389
I used to hide away from my parents and smoke.

0:01:41.390,0:01:43.489
I smoked cannabis.

0:01:43.490,0:01:45.490
When I went for further education in Birmingham, I continued smoking cannabis and hash as well.

0:01:50.750,0:01:52.750
 

0:01:53.100,0:01:54.360
 

0:01:54.360,0:01:58.459
 

0:01:58.460,0:02:04.519
It got to a point where I started selling my things for money to buy drugs.

0:02:04.799,0:02:06.799
 

0:02:06.840,0:02:12.709
I sold for instance, my mobile phone, my gold bracelet, my gold chain, and anything I could sell,

0:02:12.709,0:02:16.960
just to get money to buy drugs.

0:02:16.960,0:02:18.409
It got to a point where I could actually jump over fences to go and buy drugs.

0:02:18.410,0:02:25.309
I was a teenager, in high school when I started taking drugs,

0:02:26.370,0:02:28.370
and it was in 1994 when I went to Birmingham to do A-Levels.

0:02:28.370,0:02:32.480
I have been taking different kinds of drugs and that includes smoking, from 1994 until 2016.

0:02:33.450,0:02:35.160
 

0:02:35.160,0:02:37.160
That's approximately 22 years.

0:02:37.160,0:02:41.510
The drugs took over me and I was't my real self.

0:02:42.870,0:02:47.090
Basically, I lost my patience, I could not concentrate in my studies, I could not focus,

0:02:48.240,0:02:49.470
 

0:02:49.470,0:02:52.190
 

0:02:53.130,0:03:00.109
and I lose my temper for no reason. I was kind of confused too.

0:03:01.560,0:03:08.779
On a daily basis, how much of these drugs would you take?

0:03:09.300,0:03:11.300
It became like the way people have breakfast, and then lunch, and then dinner.

0:03:11.300,0:03:16.999
I was taking drugs in that way.

0:03:17.760,0:03:19.760
It was smoking which included; cannabis, hash, and cocaine. It really spoiled my health.

0:03:19.760,0:03:24.920
Non of my family members respected me - they looked down at me, downgraded me.

0:03:25.170,0:03:30.920
 

0:03:31.560,0:03:39.500
I felt really low within myself, deeply humiliated. I also felt responsible for all the problems in this world.

0:03:40.260,0:03:44.629
I did a lot of self harm to myself.

0:03:47.160,0:03:55.040
Haven't seen and experienced the bad things happening around me, affected me to take it out with drugs.

0:03:56.250,0:03:58.250
 

0:03:58.800,0:04:00.780
 

0:04:00.780,0:04:04.250
 

0:04:05.370,0:04:09.440
 

0:04:10.530,0:04:14.180
My father and my mother stopped giving me pocket money because I would spend it on drugs.

0:04:14.970,0:04:18.499
 

0:04:18.750,0:04:21.739
My parents got worried that if they give me money I would spend it on drugs,

0:04:22.410,0:04:25.160
and that would spoil my health.

0:04:26.160,0:04:31.820
My wife and children have separated from me because of drugs.

0:04:32.910,0:04:40.640
What efforts did you make on your own to get out of this drug addiction?

0:04:41.370,0:04:43.370
 

0:04:43.550,0:04:48.849
 

0:04:49.070,0:04:55.809
I tried the patches but it did not work. I tried the chewing gums as well, but I still smoked along side.

0:04:56.060,0:04:58.450
 

0:04:58.450,0:04:59.410
 

0:04:59.410,0:05:00.170
 

0:05:00.170,0:05:07.179
But when the man of God touched me I felt relieved, light and relaxed.

0:05:07.180,0:05:09.180
 

0:05:10.070,0:05:11.720
 

0:05:11.720,0:05:15.580
 

0:05:16.310,0:05:18.310
You said you tried so many things on the outside to stop this drug addiction.

0:05:18.310,0:05:23.290
Finally you came to The SCOAN.

0:05:23.930,0:05:26.020
Tell us how you found out about The SCOAN.

0:05:26.690,0:05:28.690
I found out from my father who has been here with my mother, my two younger brothers

0:05:28.690,0:05:33.309
and their wives and children.

0:05:33.500,0:05:37.239
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave you that prophesy and prayed for you.

0:05:37.240,0:05:39.970
 

0:05:39.980,0:05:44.080
What happened to you at that moment when he stretched his hand to pray for you?

0:05:45.440,0:05:51.249
 

0:05:52.130,0:05:56.860
When he touched my forehead, as you saw on the screen, I kind of woke up from my bubble.

0:05:57.530,0:05:59.530
 

0:05:59.900,0:06:02.049
 

0:06:02.540,0:06:06.369
That is the experience our brother is sharing. He said something just came out

0:06:06.470,0:06:12.700
as the Prophet prayed for him and gave him that prophecy in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:06:13.100,0:06:15.279
Ever since the word of prophecy, what are the changes you have seen in your life?

0:06:16.220,0:06:18.549
I sleep a lot better, wake up a lot fresher, and I can breath a lot better.

0:06:19.220,0:06:21.489
 

0:06:21.800,0:06:28.360
What the man of God said is true and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have felt this good.

0:06:28.360,0:06:30.360
 

0:06:30.530,0:06:36.250
 

0:06:36.250,0:06:38.770
Since you received that prophecy, have you taken any more of those drugs you were taking before?

0:06:39.770,0:06:46.299
Not at all. Since the prayer I have lost the urge and craving for any drug.

0:06:46.490,0:06:48.730
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:54.990,0:07:00.649
Brother, we believe you are in a position to give a word of advice to viewers all over the world,

0:07:00.869,0:07:02.869
especially those who may under the bondage of this kind of addiction.

0:07:02.869,0:07:05.689
What do you really want to advice them?

0:07:06.240,0:07:07.740
I advise people who are taking drugs to stop taking it,

0:07:07.740,0:07:14.329
and people who want to start taking drugs to not do it. It's not worth getting into it.

0:07:14.330,0:07:19.099
Smoking is highly addictive.

0:07:21.689,0:07:26.148
Smoking causes mucus and it makes your blood sticky.

0:07:26.879,0:07:28.879
That's just two of the negative things that come with it.

0:07:29.909,0:07:32.629
Thank you Jesus Christ. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

0:07:34.289,0:07:34.789
We know that the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed and our brother has taken a step in his

0:07:34.789,0:07:36.289
new life in Christ Jesus since that word of Prophecy last week,

0:07:36.289,0:07:40.128
and the deliverance he received from this drug addiction.

0:07:40.129,0:07:44.509
 

0:07:44.509,0:07:46.499
We pray that God will give him the grace to maintain his relationship with God

0:07:46.499,0:07:51.859
and we know that the best is yet to come in Jesus' name.
