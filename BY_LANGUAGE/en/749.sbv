0:00:02.680,0:00:06.000
You have a serious addiction.

0:00:06.000,0:00:06.660
Yes, prophet.

0:00:06.660,0:00:09.500
With this internet.

0:00:09.500,0:00:11.220
It has become an addiction to you.

0:00:11.220,0:00:12.120
Yes, prophet.

0:00:12.120,0:00:15.520
And there is one that even sent a naked picture.

0:00:15.520,0:00:16.440
Yes, prophet it's true.

0:00:16.440,0:00:18.880
And your naked picture is there with him

0:00:18.880,0:00:19.900
Yes, prophet it's true.

0:00:19.900,0:00:22.540
You are a beautiful girl, why should you go into that?

0:00:22.540,0:00:24.240
Now you don't have affection again

0:00:24.240,0:00:25.440
It's true man of God

0:00:29.780,0:00:32.000
Good morning, Church!

0:00:32.000,0:00:35.920
If you know today is a day of your deliverance shout "Emmanuel!"

0:00:35.920,0:00:37.320
Emmanuel!!

0:00:37.320,0:00:41.040
My name is Erica Jimmy and I came from Tanzania.

0:00:41.040,0:00:45.280
And my testimony goes like this,

0:00:45.280,0:00:50.440
Last week Sunday, I received a prophecy from the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua

0:00:50.440,0:00:55.080
First he said that I'm addicted to the internet.

0:00:55.080,0:00:59.440
Then the second one he said that someone sent a naked picture to me

0:00:59.440,0:01:01.820
and me too, I sent a naked picture to him.

0:01:01.820,0:01:06.700
Then the last one he said I don't have affection for anyone

0:01:06.700,0:01:12.020
and I confess the prophecy to be 100% true.

0:01:12.020,0:01:15.600
It all started when I was 15 years old.

0:01:15.600,0:01:20.000
I started watching pornography.

0:01:20.000,0:01:22.960
I used to watch pornography just like a normal issue

0:01:22.960,0:01:27.560
just like I'm watching movies -

0:01:27.560,0:01:30.120
just as a normal issue, as a normal life.

0:01:30.120,0:01:32.460
I used to see it as a normal life.

0:01:32.460,0:01:35.840
I didn't know that it was something that was be bad;

0:01:35.840,0:01:37.760
it was like a normal life.

0:01:37.780,0:01:43.360
This issue of pornography later caused bad results.

0:01:43.360,0:01:47.960
After watching pornography I would find myself masturbating.

0:01:47.960,0:01:57.040
After masturbating I would feel like - why have I done this, why should I do this?

0:01:57.040,0:02:00.560
But I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop there.

0:02:00.560,0:02:04.640
I started developing this issue of chatting on the internet and

0:02:04.640,0:02:07.220
Facebooking a lot.

0:02:07.380,0:02:14.340
I can Facebook until the morning to sometimes 3:00 am or 4:00 am.

0:02:14.340,0:02:20.120
Can you explain to us how this addiction of pornography and chatting on the internet

0:02:20.120,0:02:25.280
has affected your life - your academics, your social life?

0:02:25.300,0:02:28.780
It affected me so much, so much

0:02:28.780,0:02:33.740
to the extent I suffered serious disappointment.

0:02:33.740,0:02:38.520
I suffered rejection, isolation and even depression.

0:02:38.520,0:02:41.820
It came to a time that  I used to smoke;

0:02:41.820,0:02:44.940
I used to drink this hard alcohol.

0:02:44.960,0:02:47.300
I used to get irritated a lot.

0:02:47.300,0:02:52.440
.so easily, just little things and I could be irritated.

0:02:52.480,0:02:55.940
I could be so irritated that I could not control myself.

0:02:55.940,0:03:01.180
Then my prayer life, my prayer life just went off

0:03:01.180,0:03:05.160
I couldn't pray anymore, I couldn't read the Bible anymore.

0:03:05.180,0:03:10.720
I was just living like someone who would be living but I couldn't do anything.

0:03:10.720,0:03:15.180
The issue of pornography led me to have this kind of dreams, bad dreams.

0:03:15.200,0:03:23.420
There are times I used to see mermaids; she would come wearing this black thing on the bottom

0:03:23.420,0:03:27.120
and red beads on her neck.

0:03:27.120,0:03:32.620
She would tell me that until I bowed down to worship them,

0:03:32.620,0:03:39.880
I would never have  peace of mind and they would make sure I would die.

0:03:39.880,0:03:45.200
It came about that I met this man last year, in my country Tanzania.

0:03:45.200,0:03:47.960
We engaged ourselves in a relationship.

0:03:47.960,0:03:50.400
Then he travelled to Europe.

0:03:50.400,0:03:58.260
We were chatting and then came a time he asked me to send him my naked picture

0:03:58.260,0:04:03.380
but I refused at first and then he sent his own.

0:04:03.380,0:04:06.740
He was saying like, "I did it for you, so you have to do it for me".

0:04:06.740,0:04:09.080
Then I did it for him.

0:04:09.080,0:04:14.240
When this man sent me his naked picture, he asked me to send him my naked pictures -

0:04:14.240,0:04:17.660
of maybe my breast or private part.

0:04:17.660,0:04:23.720
Then he would come with these strong, romantic words like,

0:04:23.720,0:04:29.100
'Baby, you know I am horny. Could you touch this part, could you do this?'

0:04:29.100,0:04:35.760
So at the end I found myself masturbating.

0:04:35.760,0:04:38.880
So these were the trauma you were going through

0:04:38.880,0:04:43.180
and after all these issues you were talking about can you tell us

0:04:43.180,0:04:49.500
what were the issues, the problems that you usually  encountered daily as you did all this?

0:04:49.500,0:04:56.580
Disappointment, rejection, isolation, depression

0:04:56.580,0:05:02.560
and I used to isolate myself; sometimes I didn't want to stay close to people.

0:05:02.560,0:05:04.940
Sometimes, I didn't want to stay close to my family.

0:05:04.940,0:05:07.800
I would just isolate myself, somewhere far.

0:05:07.800,0:05:12.900
What you are talking about, did you at one point share with your family members?

0:05:12.900,0:05:18.480
No it's a shameful thing I couldn't share with anyone - even with a close friend.

0:05:18.480,0:05:24.500
Even someone I could share my bed with - I could not tell anyone.I kept it all to myself.

0:05:24.500,0:05:31.840
So most of the things you are sharing with us today, your parents are hearing for the first time?

0:05:31.840,0:05:36.540
I believe they are shaking right now wherever they are, I know they are watching Emmanuel TV.

0:05:36.540,0:05:40.600
Yes, we know your parents will be very happy today that you are delivered from all this.

0:05:40.600,0:05:45.560
Tell us, at one point in time in your life you were experiencing bad dreams?

0:05:45.560,0:05:49.940
Can you tell us also how those bad dreams affected you in the physical?

0:05:49.940,0:05:58.140
It affected me so much. At a time I dreamt that I was in a hospital bed, lying down there

0:05:58.140,0:06:02.640
helpless with no one to help me

0:06:02.640,0:06:12.220
Then when I turned to the other side of the bed I saw a lion - a very big one with a long tail and human head.

0:06:12.220,0:06:23.100
Then he said to me "Erica, this time around we will catch you; you will never go ahead of us!"

0:06:23.100,0:06:27.880
So after I woke up, I told my mom about that dream.

0:06:27.880,0:06:30.660
Then my mum introduced me to Emmanuel TV.

0:06:30.660,0:06:40.200
Along the line, later we had this journey with my brother.

0:06:40.200,0:06:49.560
My brother prayed by himself in his room; he anointed the car and himself with a Morning Water.

0:06:49.560,0:06:52.160
You mean you were travelling together with your brother?

0:06:52.160,0:06:54.380
Yes, I was travelling together with my brother.

0:06:54.380,0:07:00.280
So he anointed the car, he anointed himself before he we traveled.

0:07:00.300,0:07:06.740
But I didn't pray; I just woke up, entered the car and we just went!

0:07:06.740,0:07:10.560
Along the line I fell asleep

0:07:10.560,0:07:15.940
Then the voice came to me: "Erica, wake up and pray"

0:07:15.940,0:07:19.060
I woke up and asked my brother, "Were you talking to me?"

0:07:19.080,0:07:21.580
He said: "No, I was not talking to you."

0:07:21.600,0:07:24.260
Then I fell asleep again.

0:07:24.260,0:07:30.000
The voice came again, very humble, "Erica, wake up and pray.

0:07:30.000,0:07:33.320
But still I could not pray although I did wake up.

0:07:33.320,0:07:40.580
I could not pray; I was just amazed wondering if it was a voice or I was just dreaming.

0:07:40.580,0:07:45.700
Then the voice came the third time, "Erica, wake up and pray!"

0:07:45.700,0:07:49.080
Now, it was very strong - 'Wake up and pray!'

0:07:49.080,0:07:53.320
But still, I woke up but could not pray

0:07:53.320,0:07:57.120
And I then saw the car in the bush!

0:07:57.120,0:08:01.240
So that is the only thing I can remember; I could not remember anything else.

0:08:01.240,0:08:06.360
So this one is a result of that accident [pointing towards picture]

0:08:06.360,0:08:12.520
So you mean you managed to survive the accident by the Grace of God

0:08:12.520,0:08:17.560
through the medium of the Morning Water which your brother had ministered before you traveled?

0:08:17.560,0:08:22.900
Yes, it's only by the grace of God that today I'm alive, so I just say - thank You, Jesus!

0:08:22.900,0:08:25.440
And finally you came to The SCOAN?

0:08:25.440,0:08:29.880
Yes, I finally came to The Synagogue Church of all Nation to seek help.

0:08:29.880,0:08:36.260
I came for this issue of disappointment and limitation in progress.

0:08:36.260,0:08:41.860
I never knew when the  man of God said: "Come!"

0:08:41.860,0:08:46.180
I never had this in my mind that he would tell me something like this.

0:08:46.180,0:08:50.820
I never knew I was the one, that I was the cause of my problem.

0:08:50.820,0:08:56.480
I never knew that. You know, I was maybe thinking he would say I had a generational curse or

0:08:56.480,0:09:01.180
that there was something that happened somewhere which was the cause of what I was going through.

0:09:01.180,0:09:07.420
But I never knew he would speak something like this - addiction to the internet because I never told anyone!

0:09:07.420,0:09:12.420
That was between me and God because I had tried to fast and pray

0:09:12.420,0:09:17.760
but I just said: "I leave it for God; one day, I will be delivered!"

0:09:17.800,0:09:21.580
And finally what happened after the man of God gave you the word of prophecy

0:09:21.580,0:09:27.160
It's the grace of God! Last week, the man of God located me; I was sitting right there.

0:09:27.160,0:09:30.760
Then the man of God was giving prophecies to the people.

0:09:30.760,0:09:34.840
Then he said that he will just prophesy for few people

0:09:34.860,0:09:38.420
But among those few people I was there.

0:09:38.420,0:09:42.360
The he said to me, Just the way you watched.

0:09:43.120,0:09:49.740
And he prayed for me, As soon as he prayed for me it was like some thing just left me off.

0:09:50.220,0:09:55.260
Something, and I felt so light, my mind became so free

0:09:55.320,0:09:57.500
my heart became so free,

0:09:57.700,0:10:01.620
then I came to know that I don't have this addiction anymore

0:10:01.620,0:10:05.840
Chatting, thinking of pornography, masturbating

0:10:06.980,0:10:09.140
You mean you are completely free

0:10:09.140,0:10:10.820
Yes, I'm completely free

0:10:10.820,0:10:13.580
Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus

0:10:15.460,0:10:19.460
You mentioned about several things that you  were once addicted to,

0:10:19.460,0:10:27.260
You talked about depression  that led to your smoking and drinking and you were talking about a lot of things you were into

0:10:27.260,0:10:33.640
Can you explain to us, after your deliverance, what are the things that you are longer doing anymore, after your deliverance.

0:10:33.640,0:10:42.840
The first thing I noticed after my deliverance was that I was so addicted to my phone . I could chat

0:10:42.840,0:10:47.600
The I found out that I don,t want to touch my phone so many times

0:10:47.600,0:10:54.140
Even my sisters and my brothers sent me a text and it was just yesterday I replied just one text

0:10:54.140,0:10:56.840
just like I'm fine where I am, Yes

0:10:56.860,0:11:01.660
So, does it mean you are no longer having depression, no longer feeling sad?

0:11:01.660,0:11:07.920
Yes, I don't have that depression anymore, I don't have that urge of watching pornography

0:11:08.060,0:11:11.900
I don't have that urge of masturbating, I'm free, I'm free

0:11:11.900,0:11:13.740
From smoking and drinking?

0:11:13.960,0:11:17.040
Yes, from smoking and from drinking also.

0:11:17.240,0:11:18.040
hallelujah

0:11:18.040,0:11:20.020
Shall we put our hands again for our Lord Jesus!

0:11:22.660,0:11:30.460
Yes, you mentioned that the moment man of God gave you a prophecy you realised the root cause of your problem

0:11:30.460,0:11:35.660
You identified your problem from that very moment you received your deliverance

0:11:35.660,0:11:40.460
Can you give a word of advice to those youth like you who have similar problem,

0:11:40.460,0:11:43.100
that God Almighty has just delivered you from.

0:11:43.100,0:11:45.120
Can you give them a word of advice,

0:11:45.720,0:11:48.360
To the youth - I'm starting with a youth -

0:11:48.360,0:11:50.700
I will speak both - Swahili and English

0:11:50.700,0:11:53.000
Am starting with English

0:11:53.240,0:11:57.340
To the youth - youth, you need to discover yourself

0:11:57.340,0:12:02.180
You need to discover your weakness before pointing a finger on something

0:12:02.520,0:12:07.440
You have to discover something you are addicted to

0:12:07.440,0:12:14.600
Don't point a finger to anyone, like is a cause of it, no!!

0:12:15.280,0:12:19.680
You need to discover yourself, you need to discover your weakness

0:12:19.680,0:12:22.480
Then you need to seek God for deliverance

0:12:24.080,0:12:26.880
And you say you want to advice in Swahili -

0:12:28.060,0:12:29.900
Now I will speak in Swahili -

0:12:31.200,0:12:36.180
vijana wenzangu, popote mlipo najua mnanitazama sasa hivi (my fellow youth, wherever you are I know you are watching me)

0:12:36.180,0:12:42.260
popote mlipo usione aibu kwa udhaifu uliyo nayo (where ever you are  don't be ashamed for your weakness)

0:12:42.260,0:12:47.440
Mungu analeta nguvu katika madhaifu yetu. (God brings strength in our weaknesses )

0:12:47.440,0:12:51.780
Usione aibu kuleta madhaifu yako mbele za mungu (Do not be ashamed to bring your weakness before Gods strength)

0:12:51.780,0:12:56.140
atakusaidia, atakuokoa na utakua free (He will help you, he will save you and you will be free)

0:12:56.140,0:12:59.680
kwenye matatizo yako yote (from all your difficulties)

0:13:01.340,0:13:02.140
We thank God

0:13:02.140,0:13:05.880
Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus!

0:13:05.880,0:13:13.760
Just as the man of god said - when you identify your weakness, it's a victory itself, it's a half job done already

0:13:14.240,0:13:18.880
Because at that point in time Jesus will come to bring ouselves into balance

0:13:18.880,0:13:24.120
and that is what just happened to your life - the moment you discovered and aknowledged your weakness

0:13:24.120,0:13:26.460
you realised the problem is not just a generational curse

0:13:26.600,0:13:33.100
you are the root cause, the architect of your own problem and the same time Jesus has used man of God

0:13:33.100,0:13:39.140
to deliver you from the spirit of pornography and an addiction and today you can stand in the midst of children of God

0:13:39.200,0:13:42.220
to say -  "thank You Jesus" - for what He has done in your life

0:13:42.220,0:13:48.580
and we believe that the Lord who has done it in your life will do it also for everyone who is facing the same challenges

0:13:48.640,0:13:51.420
you have been just delivered from, in Jesus name -

0:13:51.880,0:13:52.520
Amen.

0:13:52.520,0:13:54.440
Now, can you advise the parents

0:13:55.280,0:14:02.060
Parents, parents out there, parents here in the auditorium

0:14:02.460,0:14:06.500
Watch your children, the company they keep

0:14:07.520,0:14:11.220
watch your children, the company they keep.

0:14:12.080,0:14:15.840
You may raise your children in a good manner,

0:14:15.840,0:14:19.400
You may raise your children in a Christianity dorm.

0:14:19.400,0:14:27.900
But watch out, once they are outside, the company they keep. That's what I can advise.

0:14:27.900,0:14:35.780
We thank God for the advice you have Given and we believe that everyone who is listening you is taking your advice to heart.

0:14:36.420,0:14:42.080
Because experience is the best teacher, you just came out of this unpleasant situation

0:14:42.080,0:14:46.880
and just advice you are giving them that everyone should be able to pray for their children and watch over them
