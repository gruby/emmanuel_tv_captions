Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesusâ€™ Name

0:00:30.300,0:00:33.200
Confess your freedom right now.

0:00:33.200,0:00:41.140
Confess your freedom.

0:00:41.140,0:00:43.480
Confess your freedom right now.

0:00:43.480,0:00:45.840
Begin to confess your freedom.

0:00:45.840,0:00:50.720
Hallelujah, confess your freedom.

0:00:50.720,0:00:56.340
Begin to confess your freedom.

0:00:56.340,0:01:01.440
Your confession matters. Without your confession,
we cannot place you.

0:01:01.440,0:01:04.700
We cannot place you without your confession.

0:01:04.700,0:01:10.920
I am free!  I am blessed! I am cured!  I am healed!

0:01:10.920,0:01:19.760
Yes, we cannot place you without your confession; your confession matters.

0:01:19.760,0:01:27.080
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:01:27.080,0:01:32.300
Confess in the presence of God.

0:01:32.300,0:01:35.580
Remember our message today.

0:01:35.580,0:01:41.500
When a farmer gets his seed into the ground,

0:01:41.500,0:01:50.600
he does not dig it up everyday to see how it is doing

0:01:50.600,0:02:01.120
but believes it is aright and settled.

0:02:01.120,0:02:05.940
Tell your neighbour, "I believe my case is settled."

0:02:05.940,0:02:07.680
I can't hear you, face your neighbor.

0:02:07.680,0:02:11.900
I believe my case is settled!

0:02:11.900,0:02:16.880
I believe my business is settled!

0:02:16.880,0:02:20.960
I believe my finances are settled!

0:02:20.960,0:02:23.440
Begin to believe right now.

0:02:23.440,0:02:27.720
Believe, believe!

0:02:27.720,0:02:29.820
My case is settled!

0:02:29.820,0:02:32.400
My finances are settled!

0:02:32.400,0:02:35.200
My health is settled!

0:02:35.200,0:02:37.360
My career is settled!

0:02:37.360,0:02:48.780
I believe, in the name of Jesus, my case is settled in Heaven!

0:02:48.780,0:02:50.600
It is settled

0:02:50.600,0:02:56.560
Tell your neighbour, "My business is settled in Heaven."

0:02:56.560,0:02:59.780
I believe!

0:02:59.780,0:03:07.240
You should believe your case is settled!

0:03:07.240,0:03:11.000
Believe now your finances are settled!

0:03:11.000,0:03:26.000
I believe! Begin to confess your belief, right now.

0:03:26.000,0:03:31.440
In Jesus Christ's name we pray!

0:03:31.440,0:03:37.620
Remember our message today, it is a very vital issue for you.

0:03:37.620,0:03:40.760
When you get home sit down.

0:03:40.760,0:03:45.900
Once you place your seed into the soil and cover it,

0:03:45.900,0:03:53.740
you do not go back to check whether it is doing well.

0:03:53.740,0:03:57.560
You believe it is settled.

0:03:57.560,0:04:02.260
Tell your neighbour, "I believe my case is settled!

0:04:02.260,0:04:06.060
I believe my finances are settled!

0:04:06.060,0:04:09.800
I believe my health is settled!

0:04:09.800,0:04:13.920
It is well with my soul!

0:04:13.920,0:04:17.200
It is well with my body!

0:04:17.200,0:04:25.040
It is well with my finances!

0:04:25.040,0:04:30.800
My business - it is well! It is a new dawn!

0:04:30.800,0:04:36.620
I say, "Good Morning" to you, my finances!

0:04:36.620,0:04:41.580
I say, "Good Morning" to you, my health!

0:04:41.580,0:04:46.580
I say, "Good Morning" to you, my finances!

0:04:46.580,0:04:55.040
It is done!

0:04:55.040,0:04:57.960
Hallelujah

0:04:57.960,0:05:00.560
If you believe this message of a farmer,

0:05:00.560,0:05:06.900
that once they put their seed in the soil, they don't go back there

0:05:06.900,0:05:11.480
to dig it up and see how it is doing.

0:05:11.480,0:05:17.020
In the same vein, if they could believe in nature,

0:05:17.020,0:05:31.080
why not believe in the God of nature?

0:05:31.080,0:05:35.420
Why not believe in imperishable Seed?

0:05:35.420,0:05:40.320
The Word of God says it is well!

0:05:40.320,0:05:45.680
Tell your neighbour.

0:05:45.680,0:05:54.000
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:05:54.000,0:05:57.040
Hallelujah!

0:05:57.040,0:05:59.380
Can you hear what the Word of God says?

0:05:59.380,0:06:06.640
If the farmer says it is well with the seed they buried in the soil,

0:06:06.640,0:06:12.060
they never go there to dig up to see how it is doing

0:06:12.060,0:06:15.060
but they say, it is settled!

0:06:15.060,0:06:18.160
Say, "My case is settled!"

0:06:18.160,0:06:20.420
Do you hear what the Word of God says?

0:06:20.420,0:06:24.460
The Word of God says, "Let the weak say, 'I am strong'.

0:06:24.460,0:06:26.580
Let the poor say, 'I am blessed'.

0:06:26.580,0:06:38.040
Let the sick say, 'I am healed'." Confess!

0:06:38.040,0:06:40.740
Hallelujah.

0:06:40.740,0:06:44.260
I want to send a signal to your spirit.

0:06:44.260,0:06:47.420
The message today is very powerful.

0:06:47.420,0:06:49.800
It really revives everyone.

0:06:49.800,0:06:51.680
I want to remind you.

0:06:51.680,0:06:55.080
Everyone of us was once a farmer; 90% of us.

0:06:55.080,0:06:59.800
Even if you go back to the village now, your father is a farmer.

0:06:59.800,0:07:04.940
If you go back to the village for 3 days, you will likely go to the farm for 1 day.

0:07:04.940,0:07:08.980
If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.

0:07:08.980,0:07:14.380
If you go to the village as a visitor for 5 days,

0:07:14.380,0:07:18.740
you will likely go to farm for 2 days out of those 5 days.

0:07:18.740,0:07:22.020
You want to go and see where you grew up.

0:07:22.020,0:07:28.620
Those days when you were very small, you were setting traps to catch...

0:07:28.620,0:07:30.440
You still want to go and see it.

0:07:30.440,0:07:32.780
We are all farmers.

0:07:32.780,0:07:35.080
Back, to help your faith.

0:07:35.080,0:07:38.680
In those days - remember...

0:07:38.680,0:07:51.020
When you put your seed into the ground or soil and buried it,

0:07:51.020,0:07:58.700
you did not go back there again to see how it was doing.

0:07:58.700,0:08:01.460
You said, "it is well!"

0:08:01.460,0:08:04.120
Until today, that is the principle of farmers.

0:08:04.120,0:08:09.600
If they could believe so much in nature,

0:08:09.600,0:08:17.380
why don't you believe in the imperishable Seed, the Word of God?

0:08:17.380,0:08:22.940
The Word of God says, "Let the weak say, 'I am strong'.

0:08:22.940,0:08:25.820
Let the sick say, 'I am healed!'.

0:08:25.820,0:08:28.180
Let the poor say, 'I am blessed'.

0:08:28.180,0:08:33.260
I can't hear you.
'I am blessed'.

0:08:33.260,0:08:36.060
Let the prisoner say, 'I am free!'."

0:08:36.060,0:08:43.500
Confess it right now!

0:08:43.500,0:08:50.920
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:08:50.920,0:08:56.400
You don't need to wait and see the prison open.

0:08:56.400,0:08:57.800
Tell your neighbour.

0:08:57.800,0:09:05.380
I don't need to wait to see my body healed! I am healed!

0:09:05.380,0:09:13.400
I don't need to wait to see my money being paid! My money has been paid!

0:09:13.400,0:09:18.100
Confess it right now!

0:09:18.100,0:09:25.020
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:09:25.020,0:09:33.480
You don't need to wait to see your career flourish. My career is flourishing!

0:09:33.480,0:09:38.260
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:09:38.260,0:09:40.520
That should be your confession.

0:09:40.520,0:09:48.700
You don't need to wait and see your body being healed! I am healed already!

0:09:48.700,0:09:50.620
That is faith.

0:09:50.620,0:10:00.940
Faith is expecting God to do what He promised to do!

0:10:00.940,0:10:03.700
What does He promise to do?

0:10:03.700,0:10:08.840
To heal, deliver, bless and promote you.

0:10:08.840,0:10:16.660
Tell your neighbour, "I don't need to wait to see my body being healed! I am healed!"

0:10:16.660,0:10:21.540
I don't need to wait to see my business flourish!

0:10:21.540,0:10:32.300
My business is flourishing already!

0:10:32.300,0:10:39.520
In the same vein, farmers do not wait to see their seed grow.

0:10:39.520,0:10:46.360
They believe it is growing! That is their belief,

0:10:46.360,0:10:50.420
Farmers do not wait to see their seed grow.

0:10:50.420,0:10:58.840
They believe it is growing; it is settled.

0:10:58.840,0:11:02.940
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:11:02.940,0:11:05.060
The problem you are facing now is that

0:11:05.060,0:11:08.880
you are waiting to see your body being healed.

0:11:08.880,0:11:15.740
When the man of God says, "You are healed", you say, "Am I healed?"

0:11:15.740,0:11:19.260
That is where satan waits.

0:11:19.260,0:11:21.780
This is where obstacle comes.

0:11:21.780,0:11:25.320
When you don't apply faith, you can't receive.

0:11:25.320,0:11:31.280
Tell your neighbour, "If you don't apply faith, you cannot receive".

0:11:31.280,0:11:44.560
When the man of God says, "You are healed" - by faith, I am healed!

0:11:44.560,0:11:49.980
When a man of God talks to you by faith, you receive it by faith.

0:11:49.980,0:11:56.500
Tell your neighbour, "When a man of God speaks to you by faith, you receive it by faith."

0:11:56.500,0:12:01.420
When a man of God says, "You are healed", receive it by faith!

0:12:01.420,0:12:14.140
Faith!

0:12:14.140,0:12:20.640
The issue of farmers is applicable to everyone, to our Christian life.

0:12:20.640,0:12:22.060
Simple.

0:12:22.060,0:12:27.140
When a farmer puts his seed into the soil,

0:12:27.140,0:12:34.500
he does not go back there to see how it is doing; he says, "Thank You, Lord".

0:12:34.500,0:12:42.860
No matter the weather, condition, or season, they believe it is settled.

0:12:42.860,0:12:47.920
Forever oh Lord

0:12:47.920,0:12:51.060
Your Word is settled

0:12:51.060,0:12:56.320
In Heaven it is settled

0:12:56.320,0:13:03.100
Forever oh Lord

0:13:03.100,0:13:05.520
Your Word is settled

0:13:05.520,0:13:09.320
In Heaven it is settled

0:13:09.320,0:13:16.780
Forever oh Lord

0:13:16.780,0:13:19.600
Your Word is settled

0:13:19.600,0:13:23.960
In Heaven it is settled

0:13:23.960,0:13:30.160
Forever oh Lord

0:13:30.160,0:13:32.960
Your Word is settled

0:13:32.960,0:13:37.480
In Heaven is is settled

0:13:37.480,0:13:41.000
That is, your case is settled!

0:13:41.000,0:13:43.120
Your business is settled!

0:13:43.120,0:13:45.580
Your finances are settled!

0:13:45.580,0:13:50.400
Someone is somewhere settling your business!

0:13:50.400,0:13:55.080
Someone is busy settling your finances!

0:13:55.080,0:14:01.680
Tell your neighbour, "Someone is somewhere settling my business!"

0:14:01.680,0:14:06.860
Someone is busy settling my career!

0:14:06.860,0:14:11.660
Someone is busy settling my business!

0:14:11.660,0:14:16.740
Someone is busy settling my finances!

0:14:16.740,0:14:27.060
Yes!

0:14:27.060,0:14:29.760
Hallelujah!  Thank you.

0:14:29.760,0:14:33.800
We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again.

0:14:33.800,0:14:37.640
Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God, as you send your testimony

0:14:37.640,0:14:39.940
Engage with God.
