0:00:00.000,0:00:02.880
Thank you

0:00:02.880,0:00:07.940
Good Morning!

0:00:07.940,0:00:10.600
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:10.600,0:00:18.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:18.100,0:00:20.360
Thank You, Lord.

0:00:20.360,0:00:27.600
Viewers, we salute your faith, your time.

0:00:27.600,0:00:32.340
Thank you for your patience.

0:00:32.340,0:00:36.540
Hallelujah!
Amen.

0:00:36.540,0:00:38.740
Glory be to God.

0:00:38.740,0:00:48.360
Today we shall talk about building God's character.

0:00:48.360,0:00:51.340
There is so much fear.

0:00:51.340,0:00:57.340
It is not even situations that kill now; 
it is fear of the situation.

0:00:57.340,0:01:04.240
Everywhere; even the politics today - fear.

0:01:04.240,0:01:09.100
Some decided not to be a politician because of fear.

0:01:09.100,0:01:12.580
People just don't know what to do.

0:01:12.580,0:01:16.660
The business too - fear.

0:01:16.660,0:01:22.020
Everything - fear, fear...

0:01:22.020,0:01:29.800
Fear of loss, fear of failure, 
fear of sickness and disease,

0:01:29.800,0:01:40.300
fear of accusation, fear of today’s politics, even fear of yourself – you are afraid of yourself.

0:01:40.300,0:01:47.220
Some people before going to sleep, they call their children saying, "Come, This is where I put the money,

0:01:47.220,0:01:50.880
This is where the bank account is,
 I have some money with these people,"

0:01:50.880,0:01:56.300
but he is afraid he may not wake up.

0:01:56.300,0:02:05.960
Because of what we are seeing all over the world; 
even among friends - a lot, a lot...

0:02:05.960,0:02:11.880
Let's talk about building God's character.

0:02:11.880,0:02:17.640
This will take us to some texts in the Bible.

0:02:17.640,0:02:27.960
We take first text from the Book of 
John 16, from verse 1 to the end.

0:02:27.960,0:02:36.560
Actually, the proof text there is verse 33.

0:02:36.560,0:02:51.380
When we leave the Book of John 16, 
we will have the grace to look at the Book of Isaiah 43.

0:02:51.380,0:02:55.560
Take your reading from verse 1 to the end;

0:02:55.560,0:03:02.540
that will give you a picture of what we are talking about.

0:03:02.540,0:03:13.800
Also, the Book of Psalms will help.

0:03:13.800,0:03:20.840
Take your reading from verse 4 to 7.

0:03:20.840,0:03:31.120
Also, the Book of Philippians, chapter 4; take your reading from verse 6 to 7.

0:03:31.120,0:03:32.260
That will do.

0:03:32.260,0:03:41.660
In all - the Book of Joshua, chapter 1, verse 8.

0:03:41.660,0:03:49.260
I want to read that Book of John.

0:03:49.260,0:03:53.280
When you get home, you have those other Books to read.

0:03:53.280,0:03:56.400
Hallelujah.

0:03:56.400,0:03:58.460
John 16:

0:03:58.460,0:04:06.960
“All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.

0:04:06.960,0:04:10.360
They will put you out of the synagogue;

0:04:10.360,0:04:23.300
in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God."

0:04:23.300,0:04:26.660
That is the right to kill you...

0:04:26.660,0:04:28.200
Are you there?

0:04:28.200,0:04:38.620
“They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.

0:04:38.620,0:04:44.920
I have told you this, so that when their time comes

0:04:44.920,0:04:49.660
you will remember that I warned you about them.

0:04:49.660,0:04:55.780
I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you.”

0:04:55.780,0:05:01.020
Because He was with us, He did not...

0:05:01.020,0:05:07.140
Let's go to the verse 33.

0:05:07.140,0:05:14.660
“I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.

0:05:14.660,0:05:31.840
In this world you will have tribulation. 
But take heart! I have overcome the world.”

0:05:31.840,0:05:35.660
That will just give us the basis of what we are to talk about.

0:05:35.660,0:05:38.560
Hallelujah.

0:05:38.560,0:05:42.620
Don't forget that Book of Isaiah;

0:05:42.620,0:05:49.860
Isaiah 43 from beginning to the end - that will really help you.

0:05:49.860,0:05:54.420
Hallelujah!

0:05:54.420,0:06:00.900
Jesus wants to be involved in our lives as mothers.

0:06:00.900,0:06:03.740
Take note of that.

0:06:03.740,0:06:08.060
That is why He is giving all these warnings and all we are reading about.

0:06:08.060,0:06:12.560
He wants to be involved in our lives as mothers.

0:06:12.560,0:06:17.400
You know mothers?
Compared to fathers.

0:06:17.400,0:06:21.660
Oh my God.

0:06:21.660,0:06:29.620
He knows there will be times fear will overwhelm us.

0:06:29.620,0:06:36.420
This is why He said, “I pray your faith will not fail”.

0:06:36.420,0:06:40.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:40.120,0:06:41.940
Are you there?

0:06:41.940,0:06:54.080
He knows there will be times fear will overwhelm us.

0:06:54.080,0:06:58.940
That is why He said to His disciples, "I pray your faith..." -

0:06:58.940,0:07:01.120
it means something is coming.

0:07:01.120,0:07:07.260
You will begin to say, "Will I be a Christian? Will I pray?"

0:07:07.260,0:07:12.120
This is what we are seeing now all over.

0:07:12.120,0:07:16.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:16.180,0:07:19.220
Are you seeing them now?

0:07:19.220,0:07:23.880
His prophecy is coming to reality.

0:07:23.880,0:07:25.760
You are free...

0:07:25.760,0:07:31.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:31.260,0:07:36.140
Fear of loss,

0:07:36.140,0:07:38.960
fear of failure,

0:07:38.960,0:07:42.580
fear of false accusation,

0:07:42.580,0:07:48.380
fear of sickness, disease and infirmity,

0:07:48.380,0:07:54.960
fear of today’s business and politics -

0:07:54.960,0:07:58.700
fear, fear, fear...

0:07:58.700,0:08:03.380
Because of that, your focus has changed.

0:08:03.380,0:08:08.340
Fear changes focus.

0:08:08.340,0:08:18.340
Businessman becomes pastor today, and turns to...

0:08:18.340,0:08:23.420
Fear changes focus.

0:08:23.420,0:08:30.580
Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan himself.

0:08:30.580,0:08:35.260
More what?

0:08:35.260,0:08:39.560
... than satan himself.

0:08:39.560,0:08:43.400
Situation doesn’t kill but fear kills.

0:08:43.400,0:08:47.760
Sickness doesn’t kill but fear kills.

0:08:47.760,0:08:57.580
Before that sickness - a medical report, "Prepare your will" - already you have died...

0:08:57.580,0:09:02.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:02.280,0:09:10.820
Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan.

0:09:10.820,0:09:13.340
Many people - they hold on to themselves.

0:09:13.340,0:09:17.860
Fear stops us from admitting our guilt.

0:09:17.860,0:09:23.140
"No. If I said this, what would happen to me?"

0:09:23.140,0:09:27.480
Fear stops us from admitting our guilt.

0:09:27.480,0:09:31.660
Look at our Lord, Jesus Christ.

0:09:31.660,0:09:40.400
The Holy Spirit is the One that sustained Him in the Garden of Gethsemane

0:09:40.400,0:09:47.500
when He prayed concerning the cup of suffering.

0:09:47.500,0:09:49.680
Holy Spirit sustained Him.

0:09:49.680,0:09:52.300
"Oh, let this cup pass over."

0:09:52.300,0:09:56.260
The Holy Spirit said to Him, "Don't forget the reason why you are sent.

0:09:56.260,0:09:59.600
You are not sent to do Your will, but the will of Father in Heaven.

0:09:59.600,0:10:01.700
Oh, let the will of God be done."

0:10:01.700,0:10:09.200
It was the Holy Spirit that sustained Him.

0:10:09.200,0:10:16.920
Fear, fear, fear - you are even afraid of yourself.

0:10:16.920,0:10:22.380
Fear of your children, fear of yourself, fear of your husband, fear of your wife...

0:10:22.380,0:10:26.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:26.500,0:10:28.860
You see suicides today.

0:10:28.860,0:10:34.760
People commit suicide because of fear.

0:10:34.760,0:10:39.340
The rate of suicides is crazy!

0:10:39.340,0:10:45.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:45.660,0:10:51.720
That is why we have to build God's character.

0:10:51.720,0:10:54.420
The funny thing is that

0:10:54.420,0:11:06.600
not even our natural gifts, talent, education can help us to overcome fear

0:11:06.600,0:11:17.840
but they can only develop and refine us as a natural man to the highest possible point.

0:11:17.840,0:11:23.720
That is what education and talent can do; 
to the highest possible point,

0:11:23.720,0:11:31.420
but cannot sustain you, cannot help you to overcome fear; of sickness, of this of that.

0:11:31.420,0:11:34.980
You see many people commit suicide today.

0:11:34.980,0:11:38.520
Let someone say, "fear".

0:11:38.520,0:11:41.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:41.820,0:11:52.120
Some are here today not because of Jesus,
 but because of their boss, mentor, girlfriend, boyfriend;

0:11:52.120,0:11:57.920
that is the reason why they are here.

0:11:57.920,0:12:01.520
Not that they have faith.

0:12:01.520,0:12:04.280
Fear.

0:12:04.280,0:12:10.920
Our concern now is to build God’s character.

0:12:10.920,0:12:22.780
If you want to become God’s person, a Christian, 
born again, you must follow His process.

0:12:22.780,0:12:26.820
God’s Word reflects His character.

0:12:26.820,0:12:36.500
To build God’s character, to become 
God’s person, to become a Christian,

0:12:36.500,0:12:41.920
to become born again, you must follow His process.

0:12:41.920,0:12:45.380
Let someone say, "His process".

0:12:45.380,0:12:47.620
You understand that?

0:12:47.620,0:12:54.820
Like women have taken over jeans, 
we have taken the soup in the kitchen.

0:12:54.820,0:12:57.740
They are the ones putting on jeans now.

0:12:57.740,0:13:00.380
Before you know it, the jeans are in the market; trousers -

0:13:00.380,0:13:03.520
you see them putting on, they have taken over from us.

0:13:03.520,0:13:07.000
In fact, we are ready to wear skirts.

0:13:07.000,0:13:10.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:10.460,0:13:15.520
They should prepare; fashion 
designers should get us skirts.

0:13:15.520,0:13:23.600
If they have taken over this; the trousers and jeans - everywhere jeans, trousers... women.

0:13:23.600,0:13:29.940
We are protesting, so let us also start wearing skirts.

0:13:29.940,0:13:33.560
So they will know that we are protesting.

0:13:33.560,0:13:35.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:35.980,0:13:42.540
You know, a processing is like making a soup; 
they put things together.

0:13:42.540,0:13:45.220
If one thing is missing, you miss it all.

0:13:45.220,0:13:51.100
That is why when you taste s pepper soup,
 you say, "What is this?"

0:13:51.100,0:13:55.120
It is because something is missing.

0:13:55.120,0:14:01.700
You forgot to add something and you start drinking a pepper soup, but it is sweet.

0:14:01.700,0:14:03.880
It is processing.

0:14:03.880,0:14:08.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:08.480,0:14:12.480
What is God's processing?

0:14:12.480,0:14:19.580
Apart from the Bible texts given to you, 
when you look at the Book of John 3:5 -

0:14:19.580,0:14:25.320
if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.

0:14:25.320,0:14:29.940
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.

0:14:29.940,0:14:34.180
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a believer.

0:14:34.180,0:14:41.580
Because God is Spirit and His worshipers 
must worship Him in Spirit and truth.

0:14:41.580,0:14:46.120
Simple.

0:14:46.120,0:14:48.080
You must follow Him in Spirit.

0:14:48.080,0:14:49.860
You must talk to Him in Spirit.

0:14:49.860,0:14:51.700
You must relate with Him in Spirit.

0:14:51.700,0:14:58.860
If you are not born of Spirit, that is John 3:5, you are not.

0:14:58.860,0:15:02.740
And the Book of Romans 8:9-10 says,

0:15:02.740,0:15:13.080
“If you don’t have the Spirit of God, 
you don’t belong to Him.”

0:15:13.080,0:15:16.660
How do we belong to Him?

0:15:16.660,0:15:23.080
God’s Word reflects His character.

0:15:23.080,0:15:32.500
Since God’s Word reflects His character, 
where God speaks, power speaks.

0:15:32.500,0:15:35.920
When God walks, power walks.

0:15:35.920,0:15:40.100
When God waves, power waves.

0:15:40.100,0:15:42.280
When God greets, power greets.

0:15:42.280,0:15:46.260
When God talks, power talks.

0:15:46.260,0:15:55.180
God's power is working through His Word and His Spirit.

0:15:55.180,0:16:04.460
Tell your neighbor, "God's power is 
working through His Word and His Spirit".

0:16:04.460,0:16:07.200
This is how He walks.

0:16:07.200,0:16:11.520
God - power; God talks - power talks.

0:16:11.520,0:16:13.740
When you say God, you say power.

0:16:13.740,0:16:18.400
Say, "God - power"

0:16:18.400,0:16:20.460
That is God for you.

0:16:20.460,0:16:22.880
It is like a tap.

0:16:22.880,0:16:29.340
You want water somewhere, you just have to turn the tap, and the water will come through the tap.

0:16:29.340,0:16:32.560
Through what?
Tap.

0:16:32.560,0:16:39.580
He works through His Word and His Spirit to talk to you.

0:16:39.580,0:16:42.240
He works through His Word and His Spirit to heal you.

0:16:42.240,0:16:46.000
He works through His Word and His Spirit to bless you.

0:16:46.000,0:16:50.800
He works through His Word and His Spirit to save you.

0:16:50.800,0:17:09.100
We must meditate on what we read in the 
Bible and turn it over and over again in our hearts.

0:17:09.100,0:17:29.260
The more we mediate, the more
 our hearts act upon the Word.

0:17:29.260,0:17:36.480
You know; to turn it over and over again in our hearts.

0:17:36.480,0:17:44.020
Not just mediation - it is like pounding yam.

0:17:44.020,0:17:53.740
You pound it - you want to make it a part of you.

0:17:53.740,0:17:59.380
In the process, turn it over and over again in your heart,

0:17:59.380,0:18:02.900
in order to do what the Word says.

0:18:02.900,0:18:10.220
Not just to hear and preach it, or teach it, but to live by it.

0:18:10.220,0:18:11.900
Turn it over.

0:18:11.900,0:18:14.700
That is where meditation comes in.

0:18:14.700,0:18:18.740
The Bible says, the Word becomes 
part of us by meditation.

0:18:18.740,0:18:19.660
Let someone say that.

0:18:19.660,0:18:22.240
The Word becomes part of us by meditation.

0:18:22.240,0:18:26.200
It becomes part of us by meditation.

0:18:26.200,0:18:34.840
Turn it over and over again in our hearts.

0:18:34.840,0:18:39.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:39.460,0:18:45.140
What is going on in your heart?

0:18:45.140,0:18:51.000
Without this meditation, our conduct and character

0:18:51.000,0:18:58.520
cannot be influenced by the Word of God.

0:18:58.520,0:19:08.460
The more we meditate, the more our 
hearts act upon the Word -

0:19:08.460,0:19:14.340
the more the Word influences
 our conduct and character.

0:19:14.340,0:19:19.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:19.220,0:19:22.480
Like you are listening to me, hearing me,

0:19:22.480,0:19:25.340
keep your heart in order.

0:19:25.340,0:19:31.820
If you don’t get hold of your heart,
 your heart will be doing what it likes.

0:19:31.820,0:19:35.340
You must have control of your heart.

0:19:35.340,0:19:43.600
While you are looking at me, continue that meditation.

0:19:43.600,0:20:15.780
For me, I meditate on the Word day 
and night and whatever I do prospers.

0:20:15.780,0:20:19.720
Viewers, thank you for your time.

0:20:19.720,0:20:26.460
Meditate on the Word of God day and night.

0:20:26.460,0:20:41.780
No matter how unsteady your life appears
 to be, meditate on the Word day and night

0:20:41.780,0:20:46.840
and whatever you do will prosper.

0:20:46.840,0:20:55.740
Unsteady; your business, your life, 
your career, your marriage -

0:20:55.740,0:20:58.600
you see, when something is like this you cannot enjoy it.

0:20:58.600,0:21:02.800
If I continue walking like this, I cannot enjoy myself.

0:21:02.800,0:21:08.940
This is how many, if not all business look like today...

0:21:08.940,0:21:11.920
Your marriage...

0:21:11.920,0:21:20.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:20.460,0:21:32.120
Viewers, no matter how unsteady
 your life, career, business appear to be,

0:21:32.120,0:21:40.980
meditate on the Word of God day and night and whatever you do will prosper.

0:21:40.980,0:21:43.000
Amen.

0:21:43.000,0:21:49.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:49.880,0:21:51.400
Tell your neighbour,

0:21:51.400,0:22:04.480
No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, meditate on the Word day and night -

0:22:04.480,0:22:12.260
whatever you do prospers.

0:22:12.260,0:22:16.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:16.020,0:22:33.740
Instead of wasting your time; 
time of prayer, "In the name of Jesus..."

0:22:33.740,0:22:40.660
For me, I meditate on the Word day and night.

0:22:40.660,0:22:48.020
When I say day and night, I mean, 
I turn it over and over again in my heart.

0:22:48.020,0:22:56.360
Whatever I do, whatever I say - you will see it any moment from now.

0:22:56.360,0:22:59.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:59.920,0:23:05.140
If I prayed the way you are praying,
 I would not be able to do all this.

0:23:05.140,0:23:15.440
The way you pray: you have a book that teaches you how to pray, you list the name of your enemy.

0:23:15.440,0:23:17.660
Sometimes you say, "Lord"...

0:23:17.660,0:23:23.240
This direction is "Lord", this direction is "Jesus Christ",

0:23:23.240,0:23:29.740
this direction is "Jehovah", this direction is "Bread".

0:23:29.740,0:23:38.700
After that you do like this...

0:23:38.700,0:23:42.640
If I prayed the way you pray,
 you would not be here today.

0:23:42.640,0:23:48.060
What you have done to me in the past...

0:23:48.060,0:23:54.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:54.380,0:23:59.260
You banned me, you rebuked me  - well done.

0:23:59.260,0:24:03.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:03.400,0:24:19.040
The Spirit of God will be released to the 
degree our heart acts upon the Word.

0:24:19.040,0:24:26.220
That is why it is very important that 
your heart must act upon the Word of God.

0:24:26.220,0:24:27.000
Tell your neighbour,

0:24:27.000,0:24:36.080
The Spirit of God will be released to the degree, to the measure

0:24:36.080,0:24:41.840
your heart acts upon the Word of God.

0:24:41.840,0:24:51.160
I mean, the Spirit of God will be 
released to the degree, to the measure

0:24:51.160,0:25:00.260
we stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.

0:25:00.260,0:25:06.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:06.160,0:25:10.700
Where is honour without your heart?

0:25:10.700,0:25:13.220
That is the honour we are giving to God today.

0:25:13.220,0:25:18.040
You come to church, but your heart is not here.

0:25:18.040,0:25:22.640
You worship, many people are dancing
 because they see their colleagues dancing.

0:25:22.640,0:25:25.140
You know - it is a hobby to dance.

0:25:25.140,0:25:28.160
People are dancing, but not with their hearts.

0:25:28.160,0:25:28.960
Tell your neighbour,

0:25:28.960,0:25:33.740
Where is honour without your heart?

0:25:33.740,0:25:40.700
Where is reverence without your heart?

0:25:40.700,0:25:46.040
Today, you see people doing... - without their hearts.

0:25:46.040,0:25:50.340
That is why there is killing, destruction everywhere.

0:25:50.340,0:26:00.460
Your son, daughter, children, wife, husband will wake up, "Good morning, sir" - without their hearts.

0:26:00.460,0:26:08.840
That is why after hearing, "Good morning, sir" - at your back anything can happen.

0:26:08.840,0:26:22.760
The Spirit of God will be released to the
 degree our heart acts upon the Word of God

0:26:22.760,0:26:24.740
but your heart does not honour God.

0:26:24.740,0:26:31.360
And Christianity lies...

0:26:31.360,0:26:34.020
Tell your neighbour,

0:26:34.020,0:26:38.640
Without your heart, where is honour?

0:26:38.640,0:26:42.700
Without your heart, where is respect?

0:26:42.700,0:26:46.260
Without your heart, where is reverence?

0:26:46.260,0:26:49.840
This is what is happening all over the world today.

0:26:49.840,0:26:53.560
You talk of marriage - marriage without heart.

0:26:53.560,0:27:05.680
That is why there is divorce, little things, "No, I saw a letter. No, this is a phone call..." - excuses everywhere.

0:27:05.680,0:27:08.280
Divorces because of little.

0:27:08.280,0:27:11.180
Marry and re-marry - everywhere.

0:27:11.180,0:27:14.940
You see: home, home; divorce, divorce.

0:27:14.940,0:27:19.180
It has become a game.

0:27:19.180,0:27:25.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:25.060,0:27:27.940
Marriage without heart.

0:27:27.940,0:27:30.900
Love without heart.

0:27:30.900,0:27:36.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:36.000,0:27:55.600
Inner my heart

0:27:55.600,0:28:11.220
Lord I want to be like Jesus
Inner my heart

0:28:11.220,0:28:32.920
Inner my heart

0:28:32.920,0:28:53.600
Lord I want to be like Jesus
Inner my heart

0:28:53.600,0:29:00.520
Marriage without heart is a marriage 
that anything can dissolve.

0:29:00.520,0:29:06.500
Situation can separate, fight can separate,
 whatever can separate,

0:29:06.500,0:29:10.020
but a marriage with heart,

0:29:10.020,0:29:15.660
"I love you with all my heart" - the love is from heart;

0:29:15.660,0:29:19.380
only God can separate such marriage.

0:29:19.380,0:29:25.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:25.080,0:29:28.540
What can separate me from the love of Christ?

0:29:28.540,0:29:30.040
Can hatred?

0:29:30.040,0:29:31.220
Can fight?

0:29:31.220,0:29:32.360
Can killing?

0:29:32.360,0:29:33.880
Can death?

0:29:33.880,0:29:36.140
What can separate you?

0:29:36.140,0:29:38.040
That is a heart for you.

0:29:38.040,0:29:46.000
Only God can separate marriage of heart.

0:29:46.000,0:29:53.980
In this marriage of heart; "I love you with all my heart. I don't love you because of money, education,

0:29:53.980,0:30:01.600
because you are handsome, beautiful. I don't love you because of whatever, just with heart" -

0:30:01.600,0:30:04.100
only Jesus...

0:30:04.100,0:30:08.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:08.660,0:30:11.800
I want to sing you a song that will make you afraid now.

0:30:11.800,0:30:14.020
You will start to say, "What is this?"

0:30:14.020,0:30:16.880
On the last day

0:30:16.880,0:30:18.920
You see, they refuse to sing along with me.

0:30:18.920,0:30:30.500
On the last day
Only true believers shall be raptured

0:30:30.500,0:30:38.500
Do you know 
There is another fellowship in Heaven

0:30:38.500,0:30:47.820
I know 
There is another fellowship in Heaven

0:30:47.820,0:30:55.320
The Spirit of God which you need to be a Christian, you need to be born again,

0:30:55.320,0:30:57.480
you need to be God’s person -

0:30:57.480,0:31:05.180
that Spirit will be released to the degree your heart acts.

0:31:05.180,0:31:12.220
You can call it ‘immerse’ or ‘immersion’.

0:31:12.220,0:31:21.560
... will be released to the degree your heart acts upon the Word of God.

0:31:21.560,0:31:23.780
You say, "I need the Spirit of God."

0:31:23.780,0:31:32.340
You need it, but it can only be released to the degree, to the measure,

0:31:32.340,0:31:37.220
your heart acts; not you.

0:31:37.220,0:31:40.340
Heart means your spirit.

0:31:40.340,0:31:43.080
... upon the Word of God.

0:31:43.080,0:31:53.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:53.280,0:32:17.480
Your consistency in prayer and faithfulness is the only way out.

0:32:17.480,0:32:19.660
Your what?

0:32:19.660,0:32:25.640
Consistency in prayer and faithfulness is the only way out.

0:32:25.640,0:32:30.580
Trust and obey
For there’s no other way

0:32:30.580,0:32:38.140
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey

0:32:38.140,0:32:46.100
Trust and obey
For there’s no other way

0:32:46.100,0:32:59.180
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey

0:32:59.180,0:33:06.080
Please, constantly pray in your heart without ceasing.

0:33:06.080,0:33:08.460
Without what?
Ceasing.

0:33:08.460,0:33:12.540
Do you know what it means?

0:33:12.540,0:33:18.780
Constantly pray in your heart.

0:33:18.780,0:33:21.140
Are you praying in your heart?

0:33:21.140,0:33:25.660
What is the meaning of that?

0:33:25.660,0:33:33.860
To pray in the Spirit means to pray in harmony with the Scripture.

0:33:33.860,0:33:34.700
Tell your neighbour.

0:33:34.700,0:33:44.220
To pray in the Spirit means to pray in harmony with the Scripture.

0:33:44.220,0:33:52.200
Praising the Lord always

0:33:52.200,0:33:58.120
every morning every noon every night

0:33:58.120,0:34:02.020
always

0:34:02.020,0:34:11.200
Praising the Lord with everything in me

0:34:11.200,0:34:17.180
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:34:17.180,0:34:19.580
Lift your voice and say,

0:34:19.580,0:34:37.500
Praising the Lord always

0:34:37.500,0:34:39.760
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:34:39.760,0:34:42.200
Open up your mouth and say,

0:34:42.200,0:34:46.020
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:34:46.020,0:34:54.600
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:34:54.600,0:34:57.020
Praising the Lord always

0:34:57.020,0:35:01.400
As long as I live

0:35:01.400,0:35:04.000
In Him I live and move and have my being

0:35:04.000,0:35:12.520
Praising the Lord always

0:35:12.520,0:35:20.720
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:35:20.720,0:35:27.260
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:35:27.260,0:35:40.620
Hallelujah
My Lord is good

0:35:40.620,0:35:44.040
He is good to me

0:35:44.040,0:35:57.380
Hallelujah
My Lord is good

0:35:57.380,0:36:00.660
He is good to me

0:36:00.660,0:36:14.320
Hallelujah
My Lord is good

0:36:14.320,0:36:17.760
He is good to me

0:36:17.760,0:36:30.920
Hallelujah
My Lord is good

0:36:30.920,0:36:35.940

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:40.960,0:36:43.320
You may be seated, thank you.

0:36:43.320,0:36:47.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:47.380,0:36:53.000
Your enemy loses no time to plot against you;

0:36:53.000,0:37:01.180
you should lose no time to commit yourself to the Lord.

0:37:01.180,0:37:04.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:04.560,0:37:12.280
You have a section of time to pray, whereas enemy is always busy, at work.

0:37:12.280,0:37:15.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:15.460,0:37:19.480
Your enemy is always at work.

0:37:19.480,0:37:23.600
That is how they keep getting you.

0:37:23.600,0:37:30.180
"Take more of me, give me more of You, oh Lord. Thank You, Lord."

0:37:30.180,0:37:34.960
If it is "Thank You, Lord", what you started to say in your heart, it is OK.

0:37:34.960,0:37:46.160
"Thank You, Lord... My gracious love. Thank You, Lord..." - that will continue in you heart.

0:37:46.160,0:37:50.820
Later it will switch to praising and worship.

0:37:50.820,0:37:59.300
Praising the Lord always

0:37:59.300,0:38:07.260
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:38:07.260,0:38:14.500
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:38:14.500,0:38:15.360
Can you see that?

0:38:15.360,0:38:20.360
Look at your song - this is the song you are singing, but you are not following it.

0:38:20.360,0:38:24.720
Praising the Lord always

0:38:24.720,0:38:26.480
Can you listen to that?

0:38:26.480,0:38:31.360
‘Always’, that means your heart should continue to praise God.

0:38:31.360,0:38:36.400
Prayer; attitude of prayer.

0:38:36.400,0:38:52.480
Because a break in prayer will mean a break in faith; 
a break in faith is a break with God.

0:38:52.480,0:39:08.900
Praising the Lord always

0:39:08.900,0:39:18.420
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:39:18.420,0:39:27.500
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:39:27.500,0:39:30.680
Are you obeying what you are singing?

0:39:30.680,0:39:31.840
No!

0:39:31.840,0:39:35.300
You are not praising God always.

0:39:35.300,0:39:38.400
You allow your heart to be roaming about.

0:39:38.400,0:39:45.140
You have to pray – that is the only way you can be filled with the Spirit.

0:39:45.140,0:39:50.340
Not this kind of prayer you offer; be on your knee - that is OK,

0:39:50.340,0:39:55.980
it is this meditation that will lead you to going on your knee.

0:39:55.980,0:39:59.880
I mean; you begin to hear from God Himself.

0:39:59.880,0:40:07.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:07.620,0:40:19.660
Your enemy loses no time to plot against you and

0:40:19.660,0:40:28.860
you should lose no time committing yourself.

0:40:28.860,0:40:31.840
This is where we find ourselves today.

0:40:31.840,0:40:43.120
We find ourselves in a very messed situation, when it comes to things of the spirit.

0:40:43.120,0:40:47.740
Bad situation.

0:40:47.740,0:40:55.760
When you are in the business of prayer, constantly praying in your heart without ceasing,

0:40:55.760,0:40:59.800
you will only release, “Be healed”.

0:40:59.800,0:41:04.580
This is what people will hear, and they will be healed.

0:41:04.580,0:41:09.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:41:09.300,0:41:11.660
That is it!

0:41:11.660,0:41:12.900
Sing this song again.

0:41:12.900,0:41:28.440
Praising the Lord always

0:41:28.440,0:41:37.920
Praising the Lord with all my heart

0:41:37.920,0:41:47.220
Praising the Lord with all my heart always

0:41:47.220,0:41:48.560
That is all.

0:41:48.560,0:41:50.720
This is what I'm expecting in your heart now.

0:41:50.720,0:41:55.280
In your heart – constantly praise Him.

0:41:55.280,0:41:59.500
Are you singing that song?

0:41:59.500,0:42:05.260
While you continue singing this song in your heart, the Spirit of God Himself will switch to prayer,

0:42:05.260,0:42:08.320
what to say; He will Himself switch.

0:42:08.320,0:42:09.900
You are not in control of your blood.

0:42:09.900,0:42:11.820
Are you in control of your blood?

0:42:11.820,0:42:16.180
So, you are not to be supposed to be in control of prayer.

0:42:16.180,0:42:20.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:42:20.180,0:42:21.700
You are not in control of you blood.

0:42:21.700,0:42:24.800
Your blood can cease; you are not in control.

0:42:24.800,0:42:26.840
It is just running...

0:42:26.840,0:42:28.380
You feel it is running.

0:42:28.380,0:42:32.640
In the same day, you are not supposed to be in control of prayer;

0:42:32.640,0:42:36.460
the prayer is supposed to switch from praises to prayer,

0:42:36.460,0:42:40.380
and when you want to release, you just say, "Be healed, in the name of Jesus. Be delivered in the name...";

0:42:40.380,0:42:41.880
people hear this from you.

0:42:41.880,0:42:46.400
Look at me; do you see any paper, laptop with me?

0:42:46.400,0:42:50.060
I'm talking from the heart.

0:42:50.060,0:42:55.520
Message from the heart, not laptop, not paper, not anything.

0:42:55.520,0:43:03.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:03.300,0:43:09.720
I'm not teaching; if I was teaching, I would have carried my laptop, my book.

0:43:09.720,0:43:12.840
I'm telling you something from the heart.

0:43:12.840,0:43:22.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:22.480,0:43:31.900
If I was telling you about someone experienced,
 I would carried my paper.

No matter how unsteady your career, 
business appear to be -

0:43:45.700,0:43:51.260
go into the business of praising God in your heart.

0:43:51.260,0:43:55.820
The Bible says, we don’t know how to pray; the Spirit helps us in our weaknesses.

0:43:55.820,0:43:58.940
In your case it is not Spirit that is helping you.

0:43:58.940,0:44:03.760
You have prayer points, and you have the hour to pray,

0:44:03.760,0:44:07.420
and if you don't have any situation you don't pray.

0:44:07.420,0:44:10.320
What dictates direction of our prayer?

0:44:10.320,0:44:11.440
Our situation.

0:44:11.440,0:44:12.260
Tell your neighbour.

0:44:12.260,0:44:17.420
Our situation dictates the direction of our prayer.

0:44:17.420,0:44:23.560
If we are sick, we say, "God, help me, heal me",

0:44:23.560,0:44:29.760
but if our everything is alright, we say, "Praise the Lord".

0:44:29.760,0:44:35.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:44:35.620,0:44:41.420
Instead of Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Father to dictate the direction of our prayer, what to pray for...

0:44:41.420,0:44:44.020
He helps us in our weaknesses, we don't know how to pray,

0:44:44.020,0:44:48.300
but now, our situation dictates the direction of our prayer.

0:44:48.300,0:44:53.540
Look at Jesus; Jesus was there with a dead man, His friend.

0:44:53.540,0:44:59.900
Instead of Him to say, "Lord, heal, raise!", He said, "Lord, I thank You",

0:44:59.900,0:45:05.860
and the Jews and all other were looking at Him, "You should raise the dead and You are saying 'Thank You';

0:45:05.860,0:45:15.460
Thank you for killing this man, or for this man to die? What are You saying?"

0:45:15.460,0:45:16.720
Tell your neighbour again.

0:45:16.720,0:45:22.460
Our situation dictates the direction of our prayer.

0:45:22.460,0:45:27.820
When we are sick, we say, "Lord, heal me",

0:45:27.820,0:45:36.420
and if we are not healed, we will never say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:45:36.420,0:45:37.960
Until you are healed.

0:45:37.960,0:45:43.420
And when you are healed, you say, "Hallelujah!"

0:45:43.420,0:45:48.540
Thank you very much.
