There is no one like you - Jesus.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:09.980,0:00:11.980
There is no one like him.

0:00:11.980,0:00:13.460
Who is like him ?

0:00:15.680,0:00:17.140
Good morning, Church !

0:00:20.260,0:00:27.700

0:00:34.800,0:00:37.420
Hallelujah !

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:41.000,0:00:46.900
It takes faith to please God and you are there by faith.

0:00:46.900,0:00:49.480
Only faith pleases God.

0:00:49.480,0:00:51.920
Nothing and nothing

0:00:52.020,0:00:53.840
Thank you Jesus !

0:00:54.280,0:00:55.860
Hallelujah !

0:00:56.780,0:01:05.920
Last week we talked about - God is Spirit and His worshippers do so in Spirit and truth.

0:01:05.920,0:01:09.060
We have to follow that trend.

0:01:09.060,0:01:13.600
The hidden truth

0:01:13.700,0:01:16.100
The book of John 16 :1

0:01:16.720,0:01:24.700
" All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.

0:01:24.700,0:01:28.580
That is the hidden truth.

0:01:28.580,0:01:31.420
Tell your neighbor : The hidden truth.

0:01:31.420,0:01:32.660
I can't hear you.

0:01:32.660,0:01:34.000
The hidden truth.

0:01:34.100,0:01:41.820
John 16 : 1  "All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.

0:01:41.820,0:01:48.760
But when you take your time to read to the end, you will understand what Jesus is talking about.

0:01:48.760,0:01:52.640
John 16 : 2  They will put you out of synagogue ;

0:01:54.600,0:02:02.580
John 16 : 2  in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you

0:02:02.580,0:02:07.460
John 16 : 2  will think they are offering a service to God.

0:02:08.260,0:02:10.260
Are they not happening now ?

0:02:11.740,0:02:15.540
People put whatever they call it...

0:02:15.540,0:02:16.920
Blow themselves up !

0:02:16.920,0:02:18.540
And said they are going to Heaven.

0:02:19.120,0:02:22.860
The Bible is a prophetic word.

0:02:22.900,0:02:32.960
Holy man were carried along as they spoke the message that came from Heaven.

0:02:33.040,0:02:35.040
Can you see it's a prophetic word ?

0:02:35.500,0:02:37.500
If you read with me. You see !

0:02:38.300,0:02:43.420
John 16 : 2  .... the time when anyone who kills you

0:02:43.420,0:02:47.140
John 16 : 2  will think they are offering a service to God.

0:02:47.140,0:02:48.260
Let's read down.

0:02:48.260,0:02:53.740
John 16 : 3  They will do such things because they have not known the father.....

0:02:53.800,0:02:58.840
John 16 : 3  They will do such things because of what ?

0:02:58.840,0:03:00.100
they do not know the father.....

0:03:00.100,0:03:04.200
Our Father who are in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

0:03:04.200,0:03:06.020
The Kingdom comes.

0:03:06.020,0:03:09.260
They will think they know Him but they don't.

0:03:09.300,0:03:13.320
You can only know him by the Spirit of the father, because He is Spirit.

0:03:13.320,0:03:21.960
The Bible says God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and in Truth.

0:03:22.620,0:03:24.760
Let's go to verse 33

0:03:25.000,0:03:33.300
John 16 : 33  "I have told you these things, so that in me you can have peace,"

0:03:33.300,0:03:38.060
That is, if you are not with God, you can not have peace.

0:03:38.060,0:03:41.920
If you are not with Him, you cannot have peace.

0:03:41.920,0:03:51.120
In Him, you have peace ; in this world, you will have trouble - trouble of all kinds.

0:03:51.120,0:03:59.360
John 16 : 33  " But take heart ! I have over come..... "

0:03:59.360,0:04:01.880
Take heart.

0:04:01.880,0:04:15.040
If you are not with Him, you will have trouble and such trouble will lead to death.

0:04:15.040,0:04:25.040
Don't make the mistake of thinking you are out of touch.

0:04:25.040,0:04:33.480
You said the devil cannot touch you ; he can touch you but he cannot destroy you.

0:04:33.480,0:04:41.520
The touch of that devil will only strengthen your desire and determination for God.

0:04:41.520,0:04:42.540
Tell your neighbor !

0:04:42.580,0:04:51.720
Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch.

0:04:51.720,0:04:52.540
I can't hear you.

0:04:52.540,0:04:57.160
Don't make the mistake of thinking you are out of touch.

0:04:57.540,0:05:01.280
Only they can't touch me... this is the mistake we make today.

0:05:01.560,0:05:03.560
This is why I called the message "Hidden truth".

0:05:03.800,0:05:08.880
That you are sick, you are thinking that you are not a Christian.

0:05:09.000,0:05:13.500
Why should I be sick when I am a Christian ? That is a big mistake.

0:05:13.500,0:05:23.440
A man can be sick in the body yet be a friend of God.

0:05:23.440,0:05:30.600
A man can be poor yet be a candidate of Heaven.

0:05:30.600,0:05:31.720
Tell your neighbor once again !

0:05:31.720,0:05:41.000
Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch.

0:05:41.040,0:05:49.220
A man can be poor or sick and yet be a favorite of Jesus Christ.

0:05:49.220,0:05:52.000
This is the mistake we are making today.

0:05:52.400,0:06:01.460
The majority of us are spiritually blind. Spiritually dull.

0:06:01.700,0:06:06.820
Dull in comprehension, that is, understanding.

0:06:06.820,0:06:18.620
The unseen realm, absolutely closed to our spiritual vision.

0:06:18.660,0:06:34.000
We only see the outward effect of the devil but we are blinded to the spiritual causes.

0:06:34.020,0:06:46.980
God can often use anything, any foolish thing, to preserve us.

0:06:46.980,0:06:52.280
to strengthen our desire and determination,

0:06:52.280,0:07:01.780
to stop us for a while and rearrange us for our future.

0:07:01.780,0:07:08.840
We misjudged ourselves when we are in such circumstances as hardship.

0:07:09.140,0:07:11.780
Why should I face this poverty, my friend.

0:07:12.120,0:07:14.120
I go to church regularly.

0:07:14.120,0:07:15.760
I am an improved Christian.

0:07:15.900,0:07:17.900
I have been baptized. I have stopped smoking.

0:07:17.900,0:07:19.180
I have stopped drinking.

0:07:19.180,0:07:21.160
Why all this hardship ?

0:07:21.160,0:07:22.620
Why ? And why ?

0:07:23.220,0:07:29.160
We misjudge ourselves when we are in such circumstances.

0:07:29.160,0:07:34.280
Maybe I am not a Christian ; maybe I am a sinner.

0:07:34.620,0:07:38.200
Why is this happening to me. Why the sickness, the set back ?

0:07:39.000,0:07:41.300
Look at my friend who is not a Christian.

0:07:41.500,0:07:46.560
They are drunkards, club goers.

0:07:46.600,0:07:48.600
They are making it... they enjoy themselves...

0:07:50.740,0:08:01.420
Sin easily hides where there is no trial or temptation.

0:08:01.420,0:08:08.800
Sin easily hides where there is no trial or temptation.

0:08:08.800,0:08:14.120
I mean, where there is no reaction of trial or tribulation.

0:08:14.140,0:08:16.280
Like many of us that are here today.

0:08:17.000,0:08:26.240
When there is no food on the table and no money in the pocket, we would likely not to come to church.

0:08:26.240,0:08:28.640
Jesus is the cause.

0:08:29.400,0:08:36.140
When there is no food on the table and no money in the pocket, Jesus be blessed.

0:08:37.020,0:08:50.680
In times of prosperity and success, even a wicked man will seem generous and kind.

0:08:50.720,0:09:01.260
A wicked man will seem kind and generous in times of prosperity and success.

0:09:01.260,0:09:10.100
When there is no money in the pocket or food on the table, this will separate impurities.

0:09:10.180,0:09:23.280
Whatever your situation as a believer - all are for your obedience to God.

0:09:23.280,0:09:24.400
Tell your neighbor !

0:09:24.400,0:09:35.920
Whatever my situation as a believer - all are for my obedience to God.

0:09:35.960,0:09:39.660
They are not meant to kill you or destroy you.

0:09:39.660,0:09:43.860
Your struggle should make you stronger if you are a Christian.

0:09:43.860,0:09:48.180
What are you going through ?

0:09:48.200,0:09:53.680
It is for your obedience to God.

0:09:53.720,0:09:59.520
We grow in character through obedience.

0:09:59.660,0:10:05.020
Open your Bible to the Book of Hebrews 5 : 8

0:10:07.640,0:10:24.780
Though Jesus was a son, a son of God yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.

0:10:25.000,0:10:27.000
He was rejected.

0:10:27.620,0:10:30.180
Are you talking of slanderer's remarks ?

0:10:31.000,0:10:32.500
Jay at him !

0:10:32.500,0:10:36.940
If you say you are the son of God, come down from the cross !

0:10:37.380,0:10:39.700
Jay at him ! You !  You !

0:10:42.980,0:10:44.820
Name calling !

0:10:46.040,0:11:00.880
Oftentimes, we run from the things that will strengthen our lives.

0:11:00.880,0:11:09.760
We run from the very things that will bring strength to our lives.

0:11:09.760,0:11:17.320
Such as pain and trials of all kinds.

0:11:17.860,0:11:21.460
There are things that bring strength to our lives.

0:11:23.880,0:11:25.440
What are those things ?

0:11:25.440,0:11:32.700
Things like trials, temptations, persecutions, name calling, those foolish things.

0:11:34.800,0:11:37.800
Wyen you know this is trial,

0:11:38.000,0:11:42.000
you will do anything to avoid it.

0:11:43.000,0:11:50.000
Another words, as a Christian, there are things that bring strength.

0:11:50.720,0:11:55.360
When you dodge it, you are postponing the evil day.

0:11:55.360,0:11:58.720
You are postponing the evil.

0:11:59.000,0:12:02.060
You will meet it tomorrow, somewhere !

0:12:02.400,0:12:06.480
You see trial coming, it's destined.

0:12:06.900,0:12:09.160
Because you need to know, you need to see.

0:12:10.000,0:12:17.000
Because we are spiritually blind. Spiritually dull.

0:12:17.000,0:12:20.200
Dull in comprehension.

0:12:20.200,0:12:25.740
When you dodge it, you are postponing the evil day.

0:12:26.400,0:12:29.280
These are the things many of us are facing today.

0:12:30.000,0:12:33.320
Those are the things you should've faced at your younger days.

0:12:34.800,0:12:39.000
Those troubles you should've encountered when you were very young.

0:12:39.000,0:12:42.000
If you dodge them (troubles), you use your ability, power

0:12:42.000,0:12:46.200
you have everything, you have connections.

0:12:46.200,0:12:48.060
You dodge them. You avoid them.

0:12:48.060,0:12:51.040
They are the ones (troubles),  you are facing today. You can't avoid them.

0:12:51.040,0:12:53.000
You are postponing them.

0:12:54.860,0:13:07.780
Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch.

0:13:08.580,0:13:10.720
Because I am a Christian. Because I am this...

0:13:14.440,0:13:18.000
You think you are a Christian. You live right.

0:13:18.000,0:13:20.880
The righteousness you are talking about is a gift.

0:13:20.880,0:13:23.000
It's not the work of righteousness.

0:13:23.000,0:13:24.200
It's not what you work for.

0:13:24.200,0:13:25.960
It's not what you labour for.

0:13:26.140,0:13:29.000
It's not what you study. It's not what you've learned.

0:13:29.700,0:13:35.440
We grow in character through obedience.

0:13:35.440,0:13:49.740
Physical growth is a function of time.

0:13:49.760,0:13:53.980
Intellectual growth is a function of learning.

0:13:54.060,0:14:05.480
Spiritual growth is a function of obedience to God's will.

0:14:05.500,0:14:20.600
Don't misjudge yourself when you are in such circumstances as failure, disappointment, sickness.

0:14:20.600,0:14:24.820
Don't begin to ask, "Am I not a Christian ? Why should all these things happen to me ?"

0:14:24.920,0:14:28.400
Look at those people who have made it. They don't live right !

0:14:28.400,0:14:30.020
How do you know you live right ?

0:14:30.080,0:14:32.740
Living right is not what we work for.

0:14:32.740,0:14:34.500
It's a gift of God.

0:14:34.680,0:14:36.680
You said, "I am living right. I stop smoking."

0:14:36.700,0:14:39.100
How do you know who stop you from smoking ?

0:14:39.260,0:14:41.260
You have the power to stop yourself ?

0:14:41.260,0:14:42.200
No !

0:14:42.200,0:14:44.000
It is grace.

0:14:44.000,0:14:45.840
And you say you are living right ?

0:14:45.840,0:14:47.480
It's a gift from God !

0:14:48.540,0:14:50.920
It's not what we work for.

0:14:51.040,0:14:53.040
If it's what you've worked for, you can boast about !

0:14:54.100,0:14:57.340
When you work for something. You (claim credit for it). You fight for it.

0:14:57.340,0:14:58.780
By merit.

0:14:58.780,0:15:01.920
I read it. I must make it. You fight for it.

0:15:01.920,0:15:08.460
In this case, our lives, it's by grace.

0:15:08.780,0:15:14.020
What is happening to you cannot take your position as a child of God.

0:15:14.020,0:15:15.640
It cannot.

0:15:16.500,0:15:22.420
Don't judge your Christian life by your situation.

0:15:22.420,0:15:25.400
This is too much, I am not a Christian. How do you know ?

0:15:25.740,0:15:27.860
Because of what you are facing, you are not a Christian ?

0:15:28.440,0:15:30.600
Because of what has happened to you, you are not a Christian ?

0:15:30.600,0:15:35.600
Because of what you are facing, because of the situation you are in, you are not a Christian ?

0:15:37.200,0:15:40.760
Don't allow your situation to rule you.

0:15:40.780,0:15:48.660
God refines us with situation like that.

0:15:48.660,0:15:56.380
The reaction of your situation on you separates impurities.

0:15:56.380,0:15:57.480
Tell your neighbor.

0:15:57.500,0:16:04.720
The reaction of my situation on me separates impurities

0:16:04.720,0:16:15.000
and allows the character of God to grow in my life.

0:16:15.000,0:16:19.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:19.780,0:16:27.700
Your situation cannot say you are not a Christian.

0:16:27.700,0:16:32.700
My situation cannot determine my Christian life.

0:16:33.000,0:16:34.420
I can't hear you.

0:16:34.960,0:16:36.960
My situation cannot determine my Christian life.

0:16:37.000,0:16:50.620
My situation separates impurities and allows the character of God to grow in my life.

0:16:50.920,0:16:55.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:55.500,0:16:58.060
So, the question... that ..

0:16:59.000,0:17:00.740
Because of my situation !

0:17:02.120,0:17:04.460
I don't know if I am a Christian ?

0:17:04.460,0:17:08.900
Why all this is happening to you ? Why you are saying this ?

0:17:08.940,0:17:12.400
It's discouraging your journey, your journey as a Christian.

0:17:12.400,0:17:15.600
You are judging yourself....Misjudging.

0:17:15.600,0:17:18.340
Whereas you are a Christian.

0:17:18.340,0:17:20.500
But because of your situation you are now thinking,

0:17:20.500,0:17:24.700
"I don't know whether or not I am a Christian? Why all this is happening to me?"

0:17:25.000,0:17:30.560
The Holy Spirit needs a free spirit.

0:17:30.600,0:17:35.640
When your thinking, "Am I a Christian ?" Your spirit is in bondage.

0:17:35.640,0:17:38.820
Your spirit must be free to attract the spirit of God.

0:17:38.820,0:17:42.000
If your spirit is not free, you cannot attract the spirit of God.

0:17:42.000,0:17:47.120
You cannot have anything to do with God ; you cannot even pray.

0:17:47.140,0:17:49.140
You need free spirit.

0:17:50.080,0:17:52.380
My Christian, why all this happens to me ?

0:17:52.380,0:17:54.000
Why all the setback.

0:17:54.000,0:17:57.500
Why this ? Why that ? Why this ? Why that ?

0:17:57.500,0:18:00.480
That's not from the free spirit.

The Bible says no temptation can seize you except the temptation that is common to man.

0:18:14.000,0:18:16.000
Stop misjudging yourself.

0:18:16.000,0:18:17.500
Tell your neighbor.

0:18:17.500,0:18:21.300
Stop misjudging yourself.

0:18:21.300,0:18:22.300
I can't hear you !

0:18:22.300,0:18:24.000
Stop misjudging yourself.

0:18:24.000,0:18:30.760
This is the trap of satan - a common trick satan is using today.

0:18:30.760,0:18:33.120
Because Jesus is coming very very soon.

0:18:33.120,0:18:34.720
On the last day.

0:18:34.720,0:18:40.000
Satan is now coming out with common trick.

0:18:40.000,0:18:44.500
When he gives you sickness, that sickness will tell you, "You are not a Christian."

0:18:44.500,0:18:48.820
You too will accept. And start to walk the way of unbelievers.

0:18:48.820,0:18:50.420
Because of the voice.

0:18:50.420,0:18:56.860
If something says you are not a Christian and you accept you are not a Christian - why do you still want to Iive a Christian life ?

0:18:57.080,0:18:59.440
If I am talking to you let me see your hand.

0:19:01.000,0:19:04.600
Disappointment keeps telling you, "Can you see?

0:19:05.200,0:19:15.740
See your friend is doing well? His business is going well. You saying you're a Christian. You're not a Christian!" You too agree, "Yes, I'm not a Christian".

0:19:15.740,0:19:19.700
This is a common trick of satan.

0:19:20.200,0:19:23.440
You sleep in the night and you have nightmare.

0:19:23.800,0:19:27.900
Somebody comes to embarrass you. You find it very embarrassing.

0:19:28.000,0:19:30.360
By the time you wake up, you refuse to pray.

0:19:31.000,0:19:34.660
What about the one (prayer) I offered yesterday ? It gives me nightmare.

0:19:37.500,0:19:40.460
The prayer I offered yesterday. That prayer gives me nightmare.

0:19:40.460,0:19:43.000
Which I can't pray again.

0:19:44.000,0:19:50.560
I have been fasting for 3 days. The last day I am supposed to hear from God. Look at the embarrassment.

0:19:51.480,0:19:59.140
Stop misjudging yourself because you are disappointed.

0:19:59.160,0:20:05.360
Why are you thinking that you are  out of touch ?

0:20:05.400,0:20:12.980
When the Bible says in this world, there will be trouble.

0:20:12.980,0:20:14.500
Are you not in the world ?

0:20:14.800,0:20:22.100
Jesus said to His disciples, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:20:22.100,0:20:26.000
That shows there will be something that challenges your faith.

0:20:26.360,0:20:30.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:30.900,0:20:39.720
He said to His disciples, "I pray your faith will not fail - you will not be abandon me".

0:20:39.760,0:20:43.440
That is what He is saying, 'I pray you will not abandon me'.

0:20:43.440,0:20:49.000
It shows that something is coming that will tempt you to renounce Him.

0:20:49.000,0:20:51.700
To say, "I am not a Christian".

0:20:51.740,0:20:56.160
They can only touch you ; they cannot destroy you.

0:20:56.160,0:21:01.220
Sickness will come to touch you ; affliction will come to touch you.

0:21:01.220,0:21:10.460
Temptation will come to touch you ; trials of any kind will come to touch you.

0:21:10.460,0:21:12.880
but cannot impair you.

0:21:12.880,0:21:21.960
They can only separate impurities and allow the character of God in your life to grow.

0:21:22.160,0:21:25.660

0:21:25.900,0:21:33.800
A true Christian is tested by his ability to face situations.

0:21:33.800,0:21:35.640
That is a true Christian.

0:21:37.100,0:21:43.100
It's like somebody who goes through school from secondary school to university.

0:21:43.100,0:21:46.260
No examation. How would you be promoted ?

0:21:46.580,0:21:49.740
When you go to school without exams. Would you be promoted ?

0:21:50.600,0:21:57.460
Trials and temptations are a test to promote you.

0:22:00.800,0:22:05.320
Your faith life needs to be tested.

0:22:05.320,0:22:10.460
To test you, all these foolish things are the examation.

0:22:14.080,0:22:19.980
You can never live and be out of touch. ( by evilness)

0:22:22.200,0:22:34.500
You will be touched. Satan will touch you. Trial of any kind will touch you. Affliction will touch you.

0:22:36.500,0:22:39.720
It can only touch you. Just touch.

0:22:40.680,0:22:53.800
That touch is to separate impurities and allow the character of God in your life to grow.

0:22:53.820,0:22:55.320
Rise up !

0:22:55.320,0:22:57.140
Thank you Jesus !

0:23:00.000,0:23:01.200
Hallelujah !

0:23:02.020,0:23:04.460
I want to offer a prayer for you.

0:23:04.460,0:23:10.760
Jesus, give them a hearing heart -

0:23:10.780,0:23:21.000
A heart to obey this Word, a heart to do the Word says, in Jesus' name.

0:23:21.000,0:23:22.860
That is my prayer for you.

0:23:22.860,0:23:28.960
