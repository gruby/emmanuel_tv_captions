0:00:00.040,0:00:04.040
How are you? You have ceased menstruation.

0:00:04.040,0:00:04.960
Yes.

0:00:04.960,0:00:06.280
As a result of drugs.

0:00:06.280,0:00:07.680
Yes.

0:00:07.680,0:00:10.960
Yes, Man of God. She is on drugs; she takes drugs.

0:00:10.960,0:00:13.320
That is what I am saying. I said, it is as a result of drugs.

0:00:13.320,0:00:15.420
Yes, Man of God. She is addicted to drugs.

0:00:15.420,0:00:17.240
- She is addicted to drugs?
- Yes, Man of God.

0:00:17.240,0:00:22.120
This has affected her menstruation and given her chronic headaches.

0:00:22.120,0:00:26.140
Yes, Man of God. It is true. I came with her. She is my daughter's friend.

0:00:26.140,0:00:28.020
Ok. It's alright. Come on.

0:00:28.020,0:00:32.220
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:32.220,0:00:34.580
Get healed, in Jesus' name!

0:00:34.580,0:00:37.420
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:00:37.420,0:00:39.860
She is free.

0:00:39.860,0:00:45.440
Following her deliverance after the prophecy, the woman's menstruation began to flow

0:00:45.440,0:00:49.380
and she came back the next day to testify.

Makes Her Way To The Restroom

Ceased Menstruation Begins To Flow After Prophecy

0:01:20.140,0:01:24.960
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:24.960,0:01:28.200
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:28.200,0:01:30.840
Praise the Lord!

0:01:30.840,0:01:33.320
My name is Hawa Nakamba.

0:01:33.320,0:01:35.600
I come from Zambia.

0:01:35.600,0:01:43.940
The persons standing beside me are my mother, my auntie and my cousin.

0:01:43.940,0:01:53.460
Last week Sunday when I came, the Prophet prophesied to me that I had ceased menstruation

0:01:53.460,0:02:01.660
due to drugs intake and that I also experienced headaches due to drugs.

0:02:01.660,0:02:06.340
I confirm the prophecy to be very true.

0:02:06.340,0:02:09.220
Hallelujah!

0:02:09.220,0:02:17.480
It all started three years ago when I was addicted to drugs in Zambia.

0:02:17.480,0:02:19.660
I used to take codeine.

0:02:19.660,0:02:27.140
In a day, I could take 5 to 6 bottles of codeine.

0:02:27.140,0:02:38.240
While my friends could only take one or two bottles of codeine, I could take 6 bottles.

0:02:38.240,0:02:44.120
I thank God because the way codeine used to affect me,

0:02:44.120,0:02:47.680
it made me not to be afraid of anyone.

0:02:47.680,0:02:54.840
I used to steal money from my mum just to buy codeine.

0:02:54.840,0:03:00.520
I would threaten her if she didn't give me money.

0:03:00.520,0:03:03.820
"Mum, give me money. I want to go and do something."

0:03:03.820,0:03:05.960
I could even steal from her.

0:03:05.960,0:03:15.000
I thank God. When the Prophet touched me on Sunday, I was delivered and I am free now.

0:03:15.000,0:03:20.600
When the Prophet touched me, I felt something moving (in my body).

0:03:20.600,0:03:22.340
I felt light.

0:03:22.340,0:03:30.440
Briefly tell us the consequences of the drugs you were taking before on your body and your health.

0:03:30.440,0:03:34.180
After taking the drugs, my menstruation seized.

0:03:34.180,0:03:37.960
I did not concentrate or listen to anyone.

0:03:37.960,0:03:42.160
When the Prophet just touched me, when he prayed for me,

0:03:42.160,0:03:47.380
immediately after, my menstruation started to flow.

0:03:47.380,0:03:48.160
Amen.

Prophecy Testimony

0:03:52.960,0:04:01.260
My memory also came back. I slept well and I feel light, after the prophet prayed for me.

0:04:01.260,0:04:07.260
I feel very light and I am well now. I am free. Thank You, Jesus.

0:04:07.260,0:04:12.120
The urge for the drugs, and everthing of that lifestyle has gone?

0:04:12.120,0:04:14.020
It has gone.

0:04:14.020,0:04:19.940
This is what happened after the man of God prayed for me.

0:04:19.940,0:04:24.480
I had not seen my menstruation for so long.

0:04:24.480,0:04:35.160
But immediately after the man of God prayed for me, it started.

0:04:35.160,0:04:36.440
Thank You, Jesus Christ.

0:04:36.440,0:04:39.040
We can see truly that our sister is delivered.

0:04:39.040,0:04:42.200
We saw in that word of prophecy as the man of God spoke to her,

0:04:42.200,0:04:46.740
she was still under the influence of the drugs; she was unable to even compose herself to respond.

0:04:46.740,0:04:51.820
But today, her memory is restored, her menstruation is restored, the addiction to drugs is gone

0:04:51.820,0:04:54.380
and she is here with her family to share this wonderful testimony.

0:04:54.380,0:05:01.000
Sister, what is your advice to people, especially young people all over the world watching you?

0:05:01.000,0:05:08.480
My advice goes to every youth watching me all over the world.

0:05:08.480,0:05:11.880
Stop taking drugs, it is not good.

0:05:11.880,0:05:17.460
Come to God, He can heal you and change your life.

0:05:17.460,0:05:18.300
Amen.

0:05:18.300,0:05:23.400
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
