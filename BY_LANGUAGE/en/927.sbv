Anointing is the power of God; anointing is in the house.

0:00:05.080,0:00:11.660
I say, anointing is in the house.

0:00:11.660,0:00:17.640
All you need to do is put your demand by faith on the anointing.

0:00:17.640,0:00:21.060
You are a faith man; you are a faith woman.

0:00:21.060,0:00:27.060
The right hand of God is power.

0:00:27.060,0:00:28.740
Listen once again.

0:00:28.740,0:00:34.900
Grudge has created a room for depression.

0:00:34.900,0:00:42.140
Whatever you are facing is a result of a grudge you are holding against your fellow man.

0:00:42.140,0:00:56.640
Grudge, pain of the past, unforgiveness - so whether you are right or wrong

0:00:56.640,0:01:02.080
please , put everything behind you; they are your adverts.

0:01:02.080,0:01:05.500
How will you be known, if people are not talking about you?

0:01:05.500,0:01:09.640
The same mouth will praise - the same mouth will condemn.

0:01:09.640,0:01:15.780
This mouth cannot say one thing; it will condemn and it will praise.

0:01:15.780,0:01:20.920
If you are expecting people to praise you, you should expect people to condemn you.

0:01:20.920,0:01:28.000
So, whatever pain, whatever happened in the past,  please put it behind you move forward.

0:01:28.000,0:01:33.060
All these are adverts.

0:01:33.060,0:01:37.860
You will soon be known all over the world.

0:01:41.540,0:01:44.420
In the name of Jesus!

0:01:44.420,0:01:47.720
Right now, put your demand on the anointing.

0:01:47.720,0:01:55.400
The right of God is power.

0:01:55.400,0:02:05.380
Let the power of God come down.

0:02:05.380,0:02:21.360
Let the power of the Lord come down

0:02:21.360,0:02:41.020
Let the power of the Lord from Heaven come down
Let the power of the Lord come down

0:02:41.020,0:03:04.440
You demon, in all places in your life

0:03:04.440,0:03:08.200
begin to command them out, in the name of Jesus.

0:03:08.200,0:03:48.020
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:03:48.020,0:03:52.600
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:03:52.600,0:04:00.320
You demon, listen to the voice of my people; I command you to right now to leave my people!

0:04:00.320,0:04:03.660
I command you to leave my people!

0:04:03.660,0:04:06.880
Leave my people!

0:04:06.880,0:04:19.100
In the name of Jesus, leave my people!

0:04:19.100,0:04:24.060
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:04:24.060,0:04:27.500
In the mighty name of Jesus.

0:04:27.500,0:04:32.140
Look, there are many things we need to observe when we are praying.

0:04:32.140,0:04:41.300
When you pray, wait; you talk - let God talk.

0:04:41.300,0:04:46.400
You pause and wait; let God talk.

0:04:46.400,0:04:50.920
When you continue to pray, continue to pray you are not allowing God to reply you.

0:04:50.920,0:04:53.580
We are not allowing God. When you are praying -

0:04:53.580,0:04:58.000
We are praying: "Leave my people, in Jesus' name, amen!" - you pause.

0:04:58.000,0:05:01.320
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:05:01.320,0:05:05.620
You wait to see what God is about to do.

0:05:05.620,0:05:11.720
But you don't wait. Even in our home, we continue to pray, pray, you are not waiting for God to talk to you.

0:05:11.720,0:05:14.760
You talk - God talks.

0:05:14.760,0:05:18.940
But it's one sided, your prayer.

0:05:18.940,0:05:24.280
When you pray, I will join you in prayer. I say: "Ok, prayer", we pray. When I now come in to say:

0:05:24.280,0:05:27.940
"Hey, you demon, leave my people, in the name of Jesus!"

0:05:27.940,0:05:36.500
You say: "Amen!" You pause.You see me pause. I will remain silent, to see what God is about to do,

0:05:36.500,0:05:45.260
how much God hears me. But you can not wait to hear from God, you just... Your own is one way.

0:05:45.260,0:05:51.380
Just one way. If God talks, you don't want to listen. Your own is your own.

0:05:51.380,0:05:57.860
You have to pause. Can you see now. It affects the response of God, if you don't allow him to talk.

0:05:57.860,0:06:03.920
It really affects the response. When you  talk and you allow, you pause, wait to see.

0:06:03.920,0:06:10.420
While you are waiting; in your spirit you continue to say: "Thank you God, for what you about to do."

0:06:10.420,0:06:19.140
He manifests Himself. But when you don't wait for Him to talk, to reply, to respond to what you are asking for

0:06:19.140,0:06:24.680
and you continue to talk, it affects itself, you will just - continue talking.

0:06:24.680,0:06:27.300
When you get tired, you can go home.

0:06:27.300,0:06:29.800
If I'm talking to you, let us see your hand.

0:06:29.800,0:06:34.740
Viewers at home, viewers all over the world, I hope you understand what I am saying.

0:06:34.740,0:06:40.420
When you are praying on your own, after praying - you pause you remain silent.

0:06:40.420,0:06:44.280
In your heart you say: "Thank you, Lord!" It means you are expecting respond.

0:06:44.280,0:06:46.840
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:06:46.840,0:06:51.160
Assume you have been doing this, you would suddenly see yourself falling down.

0:06:51.160,0:06:54.560
If I am talking to mama now. How are you, mum?

0:06:54.560,0:06:56.060
I am fine.

0:06:56.060,0:06:59.200
If I say: "How are you?" You will say: "Fine."

0:06:59.200,0:07:03.040
But I'm not even waiting for her to respond.

0:07:03.040,0:07:07.940
How are you?

0:07:07.940,0:07:13.700
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:07:13.700,0:07:24.220
Or I now say... It's God, I say: "Give me bread!"

0:07:24.220,0:07:27.520
If I say "Give me bread", I will wait for you to give me.

0:07:27.520,0:07:31.420
But we don't wait, we say: "Give me bread".

0:07:31.420,0:07:33.700
This is crazy.

0:07:33.700,0:07:39.560
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:07:39.560,0:07:43.040
God's response is very important.

0:07:43.040,0:07:50.400
It is because we don't trust ourselves - we see prayer as conventional, in a traditional way -

0:07:50.400,0:07:53.900
we just have to pray because we are asked to pray.

0:07:53.900,0:07:59.880
If you really know you are talking to somebody, you should expect that somebody to reply.

0:07:59.880,0:08:06.380
If you know you are talking to somebody, you should also pause for the response of that person.

0:08:06.380,0:08:14.640
But in this case, you don't even believe you are talking to somebody - that is why we talk, talk, talk.

0:08:14.640,0:08:19.000
We are talking to someone, somebody in person of the Holy Ghost.

0:08:19.000,0:08:24.420
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:08:24.420,0:08:28.300
God's response. Let someone say: "God's response."

0:08:28.300,0:08:34.540
I can't hear you. God's response must be noted.

0:08:34.540,0:08:39.580
When you say a word, you must wait for His response in the same moment.

0:08:39.580,0:08:44.520
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:08:44.520,0:09:04.980
