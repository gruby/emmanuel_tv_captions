0:00:00.000,0:00:02.340
I love boxing because

0:00:02.340,0:00:07.800
it gave me health and I feel I get fit. And I feel young.

0:00:07.800,0:00:10.980
When I started here, I was very sick.

0:00:10.980,0:00:14.760
I has got asthma but now I am not sick anymore.

0:00:14.760,0:00:17.940
I haven't got the blood pressure anymore.

0:00:17.940,0:00:20.980
When I look at them boxing, I feel more energetic.

0:00:20.980,0:00:25.100
What I've realized - there is no age limit. You find that the more you exercise,

0:00:25.100,0:00:27.260
the more you feel younger. Boxing is not easy.

0:00:27.260,0:00:29.800
Their fists - they can knock you down. They are my super grannies.

0:00:29.800,0:00:34.620
Life Changing Episode -  South Africa Boxing Grannies Testimony

0:00:34.620,0:00:40.140
Yes, Good morning, viewers and welcome to yet another life changing

0:00:40.140,0:00:42.360
episode of Changing Lives.

0:00:42.360,0:00:45.980
My name Anne and my name is Justin.

0:00:45.980,0:00:49.660
This is a platform where we have people who share how

0:00:49.660,0:00:53.700
God has rewritten the history of their lives

0:00:53.700,0:00:59.360
through an encounter with Jesus Christ at the SCOAN.

0:00:59.360,0:01:02.120
And today's episode will come with a punch.

0:01:02.120,0:01:07.140
A punch? - That's right - a punch, as we take the time to discover the inspiration

0:01:07.140,0:01:10.440
behind the phenomenon that you may have heard about recently

0:01:10.440,0:01:14.380
on international news - "South Africa's boxing grannies".

0:01:14.380,0:01:18.220
And guess who our guest today will be.

0:01:18.220,0:01:21.600
Tell them who it is: Claude Maphosa.

0:01:21.600,0:01:25.740
Good morning. It is well.

0:01:25.740,0:01:32.320
Welcome. Yes, he has gone from competing in body building competitions

0:01:32.320,0:01:38.500
to owning and running a gym. Not only focused on building better bodies

0:01:38.500,0:01:40.860
but also better communities.

0:01:40.860,0:01:44.860
But what inspired him to start such a unique program?

0:01:44.860,0:01:49.200
Well, let's hear how he was able to make a difference in this world

0:01:49.200,0:01:51.200
with what God put in his hands.

0:01:51.200,0:01:55.100
Life Changing Episode -  South Africa Boxing Grannies Testimony

0:01:55.100,0:03:12.020
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:03:12.020,0:03:15.140
If somebody tries to attack me, I will punch him really -

0:03:15.140,0:03:18.140
really, I will hit him badly.

0:03:18.140,0:03:25.640
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:03:25.640,0:03:31.240
So now beat just number 1, 2...

0:03:31.240,0:03:34.600
So thank you very much for joining us on Changing Lives.

0:03:34.600,0:03:37.880
Please, tell us about yourself and what you do for a living.

0:03:37.880,0:03:41.820
It is an honour to be here. John Claude Maphosa.

0:03:41.820,0:03:45.460
Claude or Coach - they normally call me that way.

0:03:45.460,0:03:52.860
What I do currently is a fitness industry based on community development

0:03:52.860,0:03:58.560
through sport. Not only on physical but emotional and all that.

0:03:58.560,0:04:03.840
And tell us about your background in the fitness industry.

0:04:03.840,0:04:07.340
My background in the fitness industry - I was an athlete myself.

0:04:07.340,0:04:13.520
I started to do karate, went into body building which made me to be more

0:04:13.520,0:04:17.820
aware by people because I was one of the very few people that were trying

0:04:17.820,0:04:20.800
to represent South Africa at an early age,

0:04:20.800,0:04:25.060
that was in the juniors,  in the seniors and in the world championships.

0:04:25.060,0:04:33.740
So by then, after I stopped, I realized that there was a lot because not so many people

0:04:33.740,0:04:37.120
had the opportunity I had. Not many youngsters from the

0:04:37.120,0:04:39.560
township can even get to my level

0:04:39.560,0:04:44.760
and I thought I must find a way on how to empower also the youth

0:04:44.760,0:04:48.140
to come into the industry. Not only in that department

0:04:48.140,0:04:51.120
but in every aspect of the department of being in the fitness industry.

0:04:51.120,0:04:58.940
Tell us, what was your situation like, before you encountered Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:04:58.940,0:05:02.220
and then your situation turned around.

0:05:02.220,0:05:06.540
At that particular time, one of my students

0:05:06.540,0:05:12.300
who saw that I was one of the best in the country at that time,

0:05:12.300,0:05:13.760
being just to compete in that level.

0:05:13.760,0:05:19.620
He introduced me to  Emmanuel TV. His name was Harry.

0:05:19.620,0:05:24.020
And then at that time I didn't understand much.

0:05:24.020,0:05:28.520
It was not something that I could spend my time in.

0:05:28.520,0:05:33.280
Because if you are living worldly life, you are not focused on anything

0:05:33.280,0:05:37.780
else but yourself. And you don't realize that for you to step out of that life

0:05:37.780,0:05:42.900
to impact on people you need divine intervention.

0:05:42.900,0:05:46.900
And at that time when he gave me: "No, there is something that

0:05:46.900,0:05:50.320
I want you to do and watch". Because when you leave that industry,

0:05:50.320,0:05:55.280
you might have seen the world but you don't have the world in you.

0:05:55.280,0:05:58.040
You might be living and nobody will remember you.

0:05:58.040,0:06:01.840
Because that's why you see most of the people they say you had a legacy

0:06:01.840,0:06:07.620
but there is nothing to show of with.

0:06:07.620,0:06:12.720
Then he introduced me, I just went home and looked for the channel.

0:06:12.720,0:06:15.140
And it was very difficult then to even know the channel.

0:06:15.140,0:06:19.000
And then that's when it started. When I started watching, I realized

0:06:19.000,0:06:25.520
that is something a bit extraordinary  and for you to help the community -

0:06:25.520,0:06:28.300
it's not what you know then, it's something different.

0:06:28.300,0:06:33.040
So I just glued and day by day I started, you know, getting interested.

0:06:33.040,0:06:39.700
Even my physical life had changed because being in an industry like that,

0:06:39.700,0:06:44.360
you diet a lot and your body can even give up

0:06:44.360,0:06:46.820
and there is a lot that goes on behind it.

0:06:46.820,0:06:52.480
So once you leave the sport, it's a little bit tough - it's a different lifestyle altogether.

0:06:52.480,0:06:58.280
That's when my life became to be different,

0:06:58.280,0:07:03.720
to be encouraged and not to selfabsorbing to myself

0:07:03.720,0:07:08.340
but to the society. That's where all it began.

0:07:08.340,0:07:14.680
And tell us, this new venture of yours that has propelled you

0:07:14.680,0:07:20.840
to the world map, so to say. Tell us, how did you encounter the prophet that

0:07:20.840,0:07:24.040
led to this remarkable breakthrough?

0:07:24.040,0:07:27.920
Amazing enough, before you see the prophet, you go to the Mountain,

0:07:27.920,0:07:33.020
and when you go to the Mountain for prayer, you'll find that this is unique place.

0:07:33.020,0:07:36.520
And then they tell you: "This is where the church started."

0:07:36.520,0:07:40.340
Now, you are open to see all these mountains, baboons and all the stuff

0:07:40.340,0:07:47.320
and then when they take you for a tour and this is the church you see - so big -

0:07:47.320,0:07:51.800
and they tell you: "This where it started", the thought is coming...

0:07:51.800,0:07:55.640
People around are working the whole day. You know, in your mind something

0:07:55.640,0:07:59.760
starts changing you, how you think. Because when you come, you're

0:07:59.760,0:08:04.160
thinking: "I want to get as much money as I want", -

0:08:04.160,0:08:09.680
thinking as other people out there. You see this small place -

0:08:09.680,0:08:15.680
eight people started it. You think: "No, that's humanly impossible".

0:08:15.680,0:08:21.900
You absorb all that within yourself and you start changing your way of thinking.

0:08:21.900,0:08:25.740
So when the opportunity to go to the SCOAN Prayer Mountain the first time came -

0:08:25.740,0:08:31.200
before I even met the Prophet then. They start showing you

0:08:31.200,0:08:36.120
the beginning, the humble beginning - what you see on TV now is reality.

0:08:36.120,0:08:40.780
And only to see that you see a small room, this room is quite big - and eight people.

0:08:40.780,0:08:45.360
And you're thinking to yourself: "How is it possible for somebody to

0:08:45.360,0:08:50.720
start in that - and then tomorrow we are here from all over the world

0:08:50.720,0:08:57.060
to encounter that?" So that kept me absorbed in my mindset.

0:08:57.060,0:09:04.640
When we finished prayers, I said: "No, I really want to see what exactly is going on".

0:09:04.640,0:09:08.100
South African Boxing Grannies

0:09:08.100,0:09:10.760
Let's go!

0:09:10.760,0:09:17.980
I love boxing because it keeps me healthy and I get fit and I feel young.

0:09:17.980,0:09:36.300
South African Boxing Grannies

0:09:36.300,0:09:41.640
When I started  here, I was very sick. I had asthma.

0:09:41.640,0:09:45.460
But now I'm not sick anymore.

0:09:45.460,0:09:48.660
I am not taking any tablets. I am healthy. I'm ok.

0:09:48.660,0:09:50.960
I haven't got blood pressure anymore.

0:09:50.960,0:09:57.360
South African Boxing Grannies

0:09:57.360,0:10:03.280
When I had the opportunity to meet with man of God,

0:10:03.280,0:10:10.980
and in the office - obviously, at first I was hoping that I show him everything

0:10:10.980,0:10:14.460
that I wanted him to see in my plans and all that you know.

0:10:14.460,0:10:19.940
And only to find that he said: "No I'm aware of what you have".

0:10:19.940,0:10:24.240
And it was like a prophesy that - what you wanna do,

0:10:24.240,0:10:29.920
is not normal and at the same time what you think you gonna do

0:10:29.920,0:10:32.280
is not gonna be exactly what is going to happen.

0:10:32.280,0:10:36.360
Because then, I was thinking I was going to have the best gyms in the world -

0:10:36.360,0:10:40.220
that's what I came for.

0:10:40.220,0:10:44.580
I was not thinking because in our industry you are thinking of how to make

0:10:44.580,0:10:47.920
a person look in a certain manner because I'm a judge

0:10:47.920,0:10:52.440
of all the fitness industry - so we are looking at the perfect body in life.

0:10:52.440,0:10:58.240
So that's what you thinking of. And when he said what I'm gonna do is totally

0:10:58.240,0:11:02.560
not even the government can do that - I had no idea what he was talking about.

0:11:02.560,0:11:06.340
And it's not exactly what I wanted to hear.

0:11:06.340,0:11:10.240
I just wanted to hear something different but then I embraced what he said

0:11:10.240,0:11:16.760
and he gave me Morning Water to pray about it.

0:11:16.760,0:11:22.440
He said: "No, I will support you but it's not gonna be ordinary".

0:11:22.440,0:11:30.060
And then I embraced that. I took it and - the rest was just something else.

0:11:30.060,0:11:34.540
Ok, so after your receiving the prophesy you went back to South Africa,

0:11:34.540,0:11:39.480
you started a new fitness centre in a remote township, not even in the city -

0:11:39.480,0:11:44.180
in a remote township. And your first customers were grannies.

0:11:44.180,0:11:48.400
How were you able to relate the prophet's message with that situation?

0:11:48.400,0:11:52.300
And how did that help you to motivate you to believe in your dream?

0:11:52.300,0:11:56.980
Before I went to that one, I was in a different one

0:11:56.980,0:12:03.600
where normally that side - it was more of an urban way where people can come in.

0:12:03.600,0:12:09.620
And then when something told me, there is a place that is in the township

0:12:09.620,0:12:13.460
and there is no one there that has ever done these gym communities.

0:12:13.460,0:12:18.120
So I spoke to the community center and all of a sudden they said: "Ok, you can.

0:12:18.120,0:12:22.640
Come through." So I left the other side.

0:12:22.640,0:12:26.160
When I went there, obviously, there was no one in the gym and what not.

0:12:26.160,0:12:31.320
And they just gave me a place and they didn't give me a building.

0:12:31.320,0:12:36.120
So I had to think: "Ok, this is how I am going to do it. It's not a big gym

0:12:36.120,0:12:40.960
but this is how I'm gonna do it." And when I was doing renovations,

0:12:40.960,0:12:44.440
the people that caught the attention were grannies.

0:12:44.440,0:12:50.500
These grannies - they were about 15 to 20 of them.

0:12:50.500,0:12:54.420
And I was thinking I still had to do my marketing there.

0:12:54.420,0:12:58.900
I still had to do A, B, C but then I saw these grannies asked me:

0:12:58.900,0:13:02.980
"We wanna come and gym." I thought to myself: "God, is this another test now?"

0:13:02.980,0:13:06.340
Because these people, I mean some of them - they couldn't walk.

0:13:06.340,0:13:09.880
Some of them had problems. You can see...

0:13:09.880,0:13:13.680
They stayed in RDP houses and they were pensioners.

0:13:13.680,0:13:18.100
So I thought this had to be a test. But I said: "But I have been to the prayer mountain".

0:13:18.100,0:13:23.480
Immediately if anything goes wrong,

0:13:23.480,0:13:27.900
I will just try and phone and say: "Hey, I have got grannies, what will I do?"

0:13:27.900,0:13:32.540
But by that time something told me: "No, give them an opportunity."

0:13:32.540,0:13:37.460
Already I thought: "Ok, now I've got 20 members, I must register them.

0:13:37.460,0:13:42.120
I don't have to look for members." But that for some reason gave me motivation

0:13:42.120,0:13:46.200
to think and go back. When I watched Emmanuel TV, I thought

0:13:46.200,0:13:49.940
maybe this was a way of what I have been told to do.

0:13:49.940,0:14:07.160
South African Boxing Grannies

0:14:07.160,0:14:10.700
If somebody tries to attack me, I will punch him really.

0:14:10.700,0:14:13.060
Really I will hit him badly.

0:14:13.060,0:14:16.120
South African Boxing Grannies

0:14:16.120,0:14:20.720
For now it's just number 1, 2.

0:14:20.720,0:14:25.920
Right now we've got more than about 30 ladies. We take them from 60 and above.

0:14:25.920,0:14:29.260
On your guard!

0:14:29.260,0:14:34.680
South African Boxing Grannies

0:14:34.680,0:14:47.020
I like boxing. Whenever I train, I feel younger. I don't get pains. I feel good.

0:14:47.020,0:14:50.980
South African Boxing Grannies

0:14:50.980,0:14:53.260
I have never trained somebody that is old.

0:14:53.260,0:14:55.880
I have always thought they are fragile.

0:14:55.880,0:14:59.620
Only to realize that there is more to them and there is more to what they

0:14:59.620,0:15:03.680
wanted to do. So I gave them opportunity and they ended up training me

0:15:03.680,0:15:07.240
instead of me training them because their energy level was just to high.

0:15:07.240,0:15:43.940
South Africa Boxing Grannies

0:15:43.940,0:15:50.620
I thought, now I have got members in the gym but yet when we look at RDP,

0:15:50.620,0:15:54.540
it's a rural development, it's a free government - these are

0:15:54.540,0:15:58.580
people from... we call them pensioners from 55 upwards.

0:15:58.580,0:16:03.880
So at that particular time now you are thinking: "Ok, I have spent a lot of money

0:16:03.880,0:16:07.200
to build this now. Obviously, you can not charge these people.

0:16:07.200,0:16:13.460
And maybe this is the way I can also give back."

0:16:13.460,0:16:16.920
So I registered them twice a week

0:16:16.920,0:16:21.460
but then I needed more anointing because some of the limbs were broken.

0:16:21.460,0:16:26.660
Everything looked shaky - and I am not a healer.

0:16:26.660,0:16:29.980
Obviously, I am a fitness person, so if you have got 20-30 grannies

0:16:29.980,0:16:33.960
and the ones are broken, you need 20 instructors to do that.

0:16:33.960,0:16:39.320
So by the grace of God... But what I have been taught

0:16:39.320,0:16:43.640
and considered - I had to follow the principles.

0:16:43.640,0:16:48.960
So in my small establishment we started...

0:16:48.960,0:16:53.840
Everyday I had to start with a prayer, I had to pray to God.

0:16:53.840,0:16:57.960
Morning Water that I have been given - practice to pray

0:16:57.960,0:17:02.500
because it's not normal anymore, it's not ordinary -

0:17:02.500,0:17:07.640
you're looking at things differently now. And then each and every day

0:17:07.640,0:17:12.000
they started coming and to my surprise, when I met the old ladies,

0:17:12.000,0:17:15.280
when I asked them: "Emmanuel!", they said: "God Is With Us".

0:17:15.280,0:17:18.880
I was shocked because this is a place where there is no DSTV:

0:17:18.880,0:17:24.520
"How do they know all that?" Because I learnt later on but they seemed to know.

0:17:24.520,0:17:30.100
So half of them had an idea. So it made my belief very easy.

0:17:30.100,0:17:34.360
So each and every day we trained, each and everyday we did

0:17:34.360,0:17:35.800
what together, we prayed.

0:17:35.800,0:17:40.020
And then every time there is birthday, they sing a birthday message

0:17:40.020,0:17:47.680
to the Prophet and that kept us to be unique as a family.

0:17:47.680,0:17:51.000
At the same time they must go home, you have to feed them as well.

0:17:51.000,0:17:56.320
But that became a motivation.

0:17:56.320,0:18:01.980
And when I came again and said to Prophet, he said: "No, keep doing what you're doing.

0:18:01.980,0:18:05.180
I am aware of that and we are in prayer."

0:18:05.180,0:18:09.200
And on his last birthday now this year, we kept on doing what he has

0:18:09.200,0:18:11.240
asked us to do.

0:18:11.240,0:18:16.660
And that's when things just changed.

0:18:16.660,0:18:22.040
For me to think "ok" from what I was doing to what it is now,

0:18:22.040,0:18:26.260
to call it totally different because you don't expect

0:18:26.260,0:18:30.720
somebody from China to call and say: "I am aware of what you are doing".

0:18:30.720,0:18:33.500
And you are thinking: "Maybe that's another test.

0:18:33.500,0:18:35.940
What am I doing?"  He said: "No, I have seen boxing Grannies."

0:18:35.940,0:18:41.080
I said: "Ok, that's a little bit strange", but I said: "No problem."

0:18:41.080,0:18:45.100
Local newspapers, they wanna interview.

0:18:45.100,0:18:49.740
So it's almost looking at about 5 to 10 interviews.

0:18:49.740,0:18:54.020
And now I said to myself - we will do what we do all the time.

0:18:54.020,0:18:58.640
Whether you come and you wanna interview, we will carry on what we been assigned.

0:18:58.640,0:19:02.340
So each and every day it's like a museum now.

0:19:02.340,0:19:06.580
Those grannies, even if you look at them now, the way they punch -

0:19:06.580,0:19:10.640
it's something unique,

0:19:10.640,0:19:14.840
it's something that is different. And for me, I still have to absorb it

0:19:14.840,0:19:16.740
because I haven't had time to rest.

0:19:16.740,0:19:20.600
And everyday somebody else wants to know.

0:19:20.600,0:19:23.895
And even they are sitting in their houses,

0:19:23.895,0:19:26.735
sometimes I have to set up an interview

0:19:26.740,0:19:30.420
with BBC Yorkshire, with BBC Preston

0:19:30.420,0:19:32.565
and I have to give my "gogos" to speak,

0:19:32.565,0:19:36.200
whether you can hear their language or not but you interact with them.

0:19:36.200,0:19:41.600
So it's an amazing grace that keeps you wondering.

0:19:41.600,0:19:47.500
If you encounter Man Of God, he tells  you that what you're doing is unique

0:19:47.500,0:19:53.520
but you need to be into prayer, you need to maintain

0:19:53.520,0:19:57.960
and when it's happening, sometimes you're still not understanding

0:19:57.960,0:20:00.580
where and how and what is...

0:20:00.580,0:20:03.420
Because these are not normal people that come to you.

0:20:03.420,0:20:06.480
Not one day we ever even applied for anything.

0:20:06.480,0:20:11.320
But the mere fact of someone out there telling you that he is praying  with you

0:20:11.320,0:20:14.580
and the mere fact of you - whenever you are watching Emmanuel TV -

0:20:14.580,0:20:17.820
you feel at home. I don't have to come this side all the time.

0:20:17.820,0:20:22.000
But whatever I have been taught - and we do that and we practice that -

0:20:22.000,0:20:24.940
and today it's just something different.

0:20:24.940,0:20:28.040
And as you can see even from their testimonies.

0:20:28.040,0:20:31.920
When the grannies start speaking, I have never had a clue

0:20:31.920,0:20:34.340
that this is what has been going on.

0:20:34.340,0:20:38.400
Because I train them for 1 hour plus maybe 10 or 15 minutes,

0:20:38.400,0:20:42.200
give them something to eat. Then next program is something else,

0:20:42.200,0:20:46.580
so when people come now to testify or you hear on TV,

0:20:46.580,0:20:50.500
when they are playing on CNN, I hear: "I had cancer, I had this".

0:20:50.500,0:20:55.840
For me it's a surprise because I am thinking, how is that possible.

0:20:55.840,0:20:58.900
How is it possible for the person who enters here?

0:20:58.900,0:21:02.280
Sometimes, if they want Morning Water, I have to put it in a bottle

0:21:02.280,0:21:05.560
and say: "Go, do ABC", - and they follow that.

0:21:05.560,0:21:10.860
So it's amazing. You can't explain it.

0:21:10.860,0:21:15.740
Only God can explain it on my behalf.

0:21:15.740,0:21:18.400
South Africa Boxing Grannies

0:21:18.400,0:21:22.320
You were saying something. You said the last time you came during the

0:21:22.320,0:21:26.120
Prophet's Birthday, like Prophet T.B. Joshua's birthday -

0:21:26.120,0:21:31.380
was there any spectacular thing he spoke about giving at that time,

0:21:31.380,0:21:37.560
that you know further propelled your giving spirit sort of?

0:21:37.560,0:21:41.700
With the Prophet... if you watch Emmanuel TV - all you see, is him giving.

0:21:41.700,0:21:47.060
And sometimes when you meet the Prophet, you wanna speak to him

0:21:47.060,0:21:48.940
the whole day because when you come

0:21:48.940,0:21:51.860
you are thinking you gonna speak to the Prophet all day.

0:21:51.860,0:21:55.680
The minute you enter there, the presence that you feel -

0:21:55.680,0:21:58.220
even if he didn't talk to you or spoke to you,

0:21:58.220,0:22:01.200
there is something you absorb within yourself inside.

0:22:01.200,0:22:04.480
There is another voice that you carry along with you.

0:22:04.480,0:22:10.240
So most of the times it's what you see around you

0:22:10.240,0:22:13.940
and what you see when you get home, what you see when you just open the channel -

0:22:13.940,0:22:16.020
all you see is giving back

0:22:16.020,0:22:20.420
and nothing else. And then you start wondering how does he do it.

0:22:20.420,0:22:25.940
And when you apply that same principal, I have never applied for any of this people.

0:22:25.940,0:22:29.100
I have never even sent an application to say: "Come".

0:22:29.100,0:22:32.140
When I sent an application, they might not even look at it.

0:22:32.140,0:22:35.980
But funny enough, the last testimony

0:22:35.980,0:22:42.220
I had, I sent an application to another company, one company.

0:22:42.220,0:22:46.060
And I said: "I wanna do something for the grannies".

0:22:46.060,0:22:49.560
And that person said: "No, not now, we are fully".

0:22:49.560,0:22:56.500
And within the same day on one of our networks, the owner of the company

0:22:56.500,0:23:00.060
said to me: "Please, I wanna interview you.

0:23:00.060,0:23:03.020
I wanna have you on our platform."

0:23:03.020,0:23:08.100
Even now they have already put that program there.

0:23:08.100,0:23:11.040
But this other person said to me: "No, we are not..."

0:23:11.040,0:23:15.380
So I realized that what God can do, no man can stop you.

0:23:15.380,0:23:21.120
On the Prophet's birthday, he said:

0:23:21.120,0:23:25.800
"Please, spend time with people that are less fortunate than...

0:23:25.800,0:23:28.000
If you wanna for my birthday".

0:23:28.000,0:23:32.800
And that is the only way to honour him

0:23:32.800,0:23:37.900
rather than whatever gift because he can get any gift from...

0:23:37.900,0:23:42.900
But the greatest gift is to honour those less privileged than you. Be it people in the streets,

0:23:42.900,0:23:48.120
the homeless, the people that don't  have what we have.

0:23:48.120,0:23:54.120
So that was one of those breakthroughs that came through

0:23:54.120,0:23:59.800
where everybody just started coming to want to know what is going on.

0:23:59.800,0:24:05.640
And then that also inspired me to realise that these are the people  you spend time with

0:24:05.640,0:24:10.200
but yet again their fortune is changed to something different.

0:24:10.200,0:24:14.580
If you gonna start having international people, even your local people don't even know.

0:24:14.580,0:24:21.200
I mean my local - those who have came through but not to this level.

0:24:21.200,0:24:25.360
They are so shocked to see it on TV. They are so shocked that sitting there,

0:24:25.360,0:24:29.720
they start wondering where is this happening. But it's just right in the  RDP Houses.

0:24:29.720,0:24:34.460
So that also transformed what he had said

0:24:34.460,0:24:37.340
that I will see amazing things happening in my life.

0:24:37.340,0:24:43.400
I will say it's amazing because like the Prophet rightly says that when we give,

0:24:43.400,0:24:47.700
we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us,

0:24:47.700,0:24:52.880
treasures in Heaven that faileth not and a burst that will never grow old.

0:24:52.880,0:24:59.900
And he says: "When you give, you are like unto God Who gives to all and receives from none."

0:24:59.900,0:25:04.120
So definitely when you give, God Himself will continue to supply.

0:25:04.120,0:25:05.300
Amen.

0:25:05.300,0:25:11.080
So as you follow the instructions of the Man of God to help the less privilleged,

0:25:11.080,0:25:14.180
help the elderly through -

0:25:14.180,0:25:17.500
do you feel you have discovered what God has called you to do

0:25:17.500,0:25:20.200
with this fitness centre in helping the elderly?

0:25:20.200,0:25:24.220
And how does it make you feel that the lives of the people that are coming -

0:25:24.220,0:25:25.480
they are being changed?

0:25:25.480,0:25:29.560
I feel like we can still do more. I feel like I am still learning.

0:25:29.560,0:25:36.100
Because every time I switch it on - I'm watching 24/7. I sleep watching Emmanuel TV.

0:25:36.100,0:25:39.240
You get to know things differently.

0:25:39.240,0:25:44.580
You get to see the gap in life, the people that you don't think of,

0:25:44.580,0:25:48.420
you feel like you are in training.

0:25:48.420,0:25:53.240
So presently, I still feel like I'm in training and maybe...

0:25:53.240,0:25:54.980
But I still feel like I'm in training.

0:25:54.980,0:26:00.020
And I'm still being trained as well because it's not an easy thing,

0:26:00.020,0:26:04.860
you need Divine intervention most definitely to know the direction.

0:26:04.860,0:26:10.540
Because the magnitude, them themselves - we still find it normal.

0:26:10.540,0:26:14.060
But only when somebody comes and says: "This is what you have done,

0:26:14.060,0:26:18.580
this is what is going on. This is what is changing our lives."

0:26:18.580,0:26:24.040
I'm not taking any tablets. I'm healthy. I am ok. I haven't got blood pressure anymore.

0:26:24.040,0:27:24.260
South Africa Boxing Grannies

0:27:24.260,0:27:30.820
And presently, giving back in this magnitude and realising that

0:27:30.820,0:27:36.960
these old ladies are going home and everytime they are looking forward to the gym,

0:27:36.960,0:27:42.600
it gives me peace of heart. It gives me something to look forward for myself.

0:27:42.600,0:27:46.420
Even if I'm down, I know that somebody out there needs me,

0:27:46.420,0:27:49.700
somebody out there needs something from me.

0:27:49.700,0:27:54.460
And them, giving testimonies of: "I don't go to the doctor anymore,

0:27:54.460,0:27:59.280
my limbs feel a little bit better", if I don't go to the gym and workout,

0:27:59.280,0:28:02.840
even my life at home is not as good as it.

0:28:02.840,0:28:07.220
And them, be able to do what they normally can not do - that is giving me

0:28:07.220,0:28:11.200
a lot of encouragement.

0:28:11.200,0:28:15.940
Wow. You have said so much but I want to ask you -

0:28:15.940,0:28:24.200
what impact has your dream and your vision got on the international community

0:28:24.200,0:28:28.600
today, knowing that the elderly ones in society

0:28:28.600,0:28:31.340
are always subjected to life of seclusion?

0:28:31.340,0:28:35.200
So what impact has it had on international communities?

0:28:35.200,0:28:38.760
Like you said, people have been calling you from all over the world

0:28:38.760,0:28:46.040
that they just want to visit your gym just to see those grannies who are

0:28:46.040,0:28:47.360
kicking and boxing?

0:28:47.360,0:28:54.560
This is overwhelming and to be known, to be one of those fitness coach

0:28:54.560,0:29:02.920
or that small A-team gym - it's amazing and it's hard to even think of

0:29:02.920,0:29:06.660
because these are not your normal TV stations,

0:29:06.660,0:29:08.460
these are breaking news.

0:29:08.460,0:29:13.060
And on top of that they are talking about what is happening internationally

0:29:13.060,0:29:15.240
at that particular time.

0:29:15.240,0:29:18.600
And all of a sudden, they are playing a clip about your boxing grannies

0:29:18.600,0:29:23.940
and you as well as a person, so it's quite enormous,

0:29:23.940,0:29:28.940
it's quite overwhelming and it's something that you can not explain.

0:29:28.940,0:29:32.320
Only God can explain. It's quite something different.

0:29:32.320,0:29:36.580
Because as a person who thought: "Ok, I will just be in my industry",

0:29:36.580,0:29:40.460
you never thought to go across the board.

0:29:40.460,0:29:43.300
Yes, you wanted to do that but not to this magnitude now.

0:29:43.300,0:29:46.540
So tell us, countries that have been visiting you so far

0:29:46.540,0:29:48.660
to see you since you introduced this?

0:29:48.660,0:29:55.220
Two German TV networks and the biggest one in Germany.

0:29:55.220,0:30:02.580
We've got France, we have got CGTN that is central.

0:30:02.580,0:30:07.760
We have got CCTV China, we have got the Swedish network.

0:30:07.760,0:30:16.100
We have got BBC - almost all the BBC Africa.

0:30:16.100,0:30:18.860
We have got the Middle East, Alejeezera.

0:30:18.860,0:30:25.300
And some of them, USA today - they are just taking all the clips together.

0:30:25.300,0:30:29.800
You have got each and everyone wanting the story.

0:30:29.800,0:30:32.420
I can not even go beyond that because

0:30:32.420,0:30:35.160
they are being inspired with what these grannies have done.

0:30:35.160,0:30:40.960
So, some of them - they are international.

0:30:40.960,0:30:45.920
Locally, they've been to 405 networks. They were just on the studio now.

0:30:45.920,0:30:49.180
They have been to all the radio stations, almost all the radio stations

0:30:49.180,0:30:54.040
speaking healthy life. And you talking of

0:30:54.040,0:30:57.420
the biggest radio stations in South Africa.

0:30:57.420,0:31:01.400
And at a particular time where people buy a slot - they don't even buy in slots.

0:31:01.400,0:31:05.060
So that is being very magnitude.

0:31:05.060,0:31:08.160
To God be the Glory, that's absolutely incredible

0:31:08.160,0:31:14.120
and your fitness centre  helping the elderly has been a source of inspiration

0:31:14.120,0:31:18.560
for people all around the world. So what is your advice for people

0:31:18.560,0:31:21.800
who are close to the elderly anywhere around the world.

0:31:21.800,0:31:23.920
What will be your advice to them?

0:31:23.920,0:31:30.580
My first advice is to stay connected to Emmanuel TV - it will change your life.

0:31:30.580,0:31:35.660
And for some of us, we are still learning how to go about it

0:31:35.660,0:31:40.000
and you need someone that has been there and  knows exactly

0:31:40.000,0:31:44.360
because taking care of our old ladies is not an easy thing.

0:31:44.360,0:31:50.340
And it's never been heard of, it's tough because most of the youth now...

0:31:50.340,0:31:56.200
Maybe they are taking care of their grand kids, they go to live life.

0:31:56.200,0:32:00.280
But you don't realise that those are the people who can change your life.

0:32:00.280,0:32:01.720
If you honour them.

0:32:01.720,0:32:04.660
Those are the  people that you can not take for granted.

0:32:04.660,0:32:08.720
Because they have so much to give, and if you don't give to them,

0:32:08.720,0:32:10.760
they will give the blessings to someone.

0:32:10.760,0:32:15.140
Because these are ordinary people being placed in a home

0:32:15.140,0:32:21.360
where not even anybody visits them but the mere fact of now even adverts -

0:32:21.360,0:32:24.820
people want to do movies, people want to do ABC

0:32:24.820,0:32:30.100
based on their livestyle. So you can imagine what's gonna happen to them

0:32:30.100,0:32:32.580
because they are being seen all over the world

0:32:32.580,0:32:34.640
and these are the same people that you lived with.

0:32:34.640,0:32:39.980
And somebody saw the opportunity and said: "Don't throw them out".

0:32:39.980,0:32:45.420
So they are changing not only everybody's life, even their family's life.

0:32:45.420,0:32:50.600
Those who had thought: "No, this is just..." They have done a lot,

0:32:50.600,0:32:52.640
quite a lot.

0:32:52.640,0:32:57.780
And that's like Prophet T.B. Joshua has been saying that as you help the less privileged,

0:32:57.780,0:33:01.040
as you help the elderly in your community, you'll begin to discover

0:33:01.040,0:33:08.460
yourself and what God has called you to do and that's exactly what has been happening in your life as well.

0:33:08.460,0:33:10.220
Most definitely.

0:33:10.220,0:33:16.160
All I can say now, meeting Man of God, having an opportunity to sit with him

0:33:16.160,0:33:21.720
and also for him what he said, it has come to pass.

0:33:21.720,0:33:26.200
The prophesy that he said that what I do, is not going to be ordinary,

0:33:26.200,0:33:31.140
and obviously, it's gonna be something that is unheard of -

0:33:31.140,0:33:35.880
now it has come to pass in a manner that no matter what

0:33:35.880,0:33:40.780
happens, people are aware that to change somebody's life

0:33:40.780,0:33:45.860
you have to look after the elderly. And for me, I don't take that for granted,

0:33:45.860,0:33:48.200
no matter the circumstances.

0:33:48.200,0:33:53.120
Fantastic. Well, we have got some questions from some viewers around

0:33:53.120,0:33:57.420
the world that have been inspired by what you are doing. So we quickly

0:33:57.420,0:34:00.360
read them out for you.

0:34:00.360,0:34:04.180
Here Claude, we have questions for you from our viewers.

0:34:04.180,0:34:10.080
First question comes from Irene who stays in Luxembourg.

0:34:10.080,0:34:13.740
And she says: "I love your work,

0:34:13.740,0:34:19.420
and how God is using you to impact people's lives so wonderfully.

0:34:19.420,0:34:22.040
How can I support it?"

0:34:22.040,0:34:31.520
Most definitely, I will say - look around you and visit the elderly.

0:34:31.520,0:34:39.420
It has to start within and we will also support you in every way we can,

0:34:39.420,0:34:46.160
if you need assistance, we can always be there to come and advice

0:34:46.160,0:34:52.040
because it takes one with a big heart and the heart has to be from God.

0:34:52.040,0:34:58.560
And if it's not from God, you can do it for today but tomorrow when challenges come, it's not easy.

0:34:58.560,0:35:05.020
And it's something that for that person in Luxembourg to see what is happening.

0:35:05.020,0:35:07.180
Obviously, she has already been touched,

0:35:07.180,0:35:13.400
so that's one of the things I can say.

0:35:13.400,0:35:18.440
And we are open to any help we can

0:35:18.440,0:35:25.520
and we would also like to spread to other places to advice where we can

0:35:25.520,0:35:30.960
and to say those who are interested in doing A,B,C. But most importantly around you

0:35:30.960,0:35:35.740
you will see that there is somebody in need - that's where you can also start.

0:35:35.740,0:35:42.300
That's a wonderful advice. I believe Irene is listening to you right now. She is pleased.

0:35:42.300,0:35:47.780
So we got another question from the viewers. It's from Mavis, she is from Scotland.

0:35:47.780,0:35:53.620
She says: "I am old woman of 76 years old, I have been very inspired by your program.

0:35:53.620,0:36:00.220
I always stay at home. Rarely going out and engaging in outdoor activities because of the cold weather.

0:36:00.220,0:36:03.340
What advice would you give me?"

0:36:03.340,0:36:07.360
Cold weather is actually an advantage

0:36:07.360,0:36:10.980
because once you start taking the gloves, as you can see, you start sweating.

0:36:10.980,0:36:16.960
So that would be one of those things that can even motivate you more.

0:36:16.960,0:36:24.240
It's not like us here, where it's hot and already our metabolism and our system is already fired up.

0:36:24.240,0:36:31.060
So wherever she is, I mean it's just a matter of getting out of that comfort zone.

0:36:31.060,0:36:38.520
And be able to say "no" one or two. You don't have to start saying: "I'm going to break a bone today."

0:36:38.520,0:36:44.240
It's once a day you wake up in the morning, you do what you have to do

0:36:44.240,0:36:53.980
and even on nutrition side we advice as well that you don't have to eat so much or whatever it is.

0:36:53.980,0:36:58.060
You wake up in the morning, you eat your garlic and ginger, that will wake you up.

0:36:58.060,0:37:02.140
If you are not having people around you. And then after that you just eat your apple

0:37:02.140,0:37:06.600
and what just to sustain your energy level.

0:37:06.600,0:37:09.520
So that also gives you an encouragement.

0:37:09.520,0:37:16.520
And even on our platform, our boxing grannies, every Tuesday, Thursday - if you go to their facebook page,

0:37:16.520,0:37:22.040
you will see what they did today. So we try and encourage to say - they are doing it.

0:37:22.040,0:37:25.900
And it's not that they started today - they have been doing it for a while.

0:37:25.900,0:37:32.980
You follow them - they couldn't walk but now they are walking. And wherever she is, she shouldn't be discouraged.

0:37:32.980,0:37:39.200
Just being around them and see what they do and that will keep her going as well.

0:37:39.200,0:37:45.000
Thank God. Wonderful advice, we believe Mavis is listening wherever she is and that will inspire her

0:37:45.000,0:37:47.400
to get the boxing gloves on.

0:37:47.400,0:37:51.100
Most definitely. Thank you.

0:37:51.100,0:37:55.100
We thank God for the inspiration He has given you. Emmanuel, thank you.

0:37:55.100,0:38:11.540
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:38:11.540,0:38:18.340
If somebody tries to attack me, I will punch him really. Really, I will hit him badly.

0:38:18.340,0:38:28.440
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:38:28.440,0:38:33.420
Now it's just gonna be 1, 2.

0:38:33.420,0:38:38.100
Right now we have got  more than about 30 ladies, we take them from 60 and above.

0:38:38.100,0:38:46.580
On your guard, gogo. Don't forget, on your guard.

0:38:46.580,0:38:59.940
I like boxing. Whenever I train, I feel young. I don't get pains, I feel good.

0:38:59.940,0:39:03.940
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:39:03.940,0:39:07.900
I have never trained somebody that is old. I have always thought they are fragile.

0:39:07.900,0:39:14.600
Only to realise that there is more to them and there is more to what they wanted to do, so I gave them opportunity.

0:39:14.600,0:39:19.060
And they ended up training me instead of me training them because their energy level was just too high.

0:39:19.060,0:39:59.020
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:39:59.020,0:40:04.500
Well, Coach Claude, we have seen the South African Boxing Grannies and are absolutely impressed

0:40:04.500,0:40:07.240
with their skills and the training that you have been giving them.

0:40:07.240,0:40:12.000
But it's a shame that there is no grannies around here that you could give a demonstration for.

0:40:12.000,0:40:15.920
Come on, wait a minute. Do you need a granny here? I'm here.

0:40:15.920,0:40:19.420
Let's do it. We've got Annie.

0:40:19.420,0:40:22.700
Lets see how the grannies do it.

0:40:22.700,0:40:27.840
So all the way to Luxembourg.

0:40:27.840,0:40:37.880
So Irene, let's show you how we do it.

0:40:37.880,0:40:42.780
So the most important part, obviously you don't start with your...

0:40:42.780,0:40:47.400
You just start of with your warm up. You take this hand and you put it on the other side.

0:40:47.400,0:40:57.760
You just punch there, that's 1, 2, right. You can punch twice 1,2 and then you go 3,3.

0:40:57.760,0:41:00.460
But always make sure that when you punch, you're always on your guard.

0:41:00.460,0:41:05.680
Your hands are up, right. What it means - when your hands are up like this, it is locked, no matter what happens -

0:41:05.680,0:41:10.960
nothing comes, nothing happens to you. So when you punch, you just punch 1, punch again.

0:41:10.960,0:41:15.000
And then on your guard. So punch again - on your guard.

0:41:15.000,0:41:19.220
So now, what you do - if you don't wanna guard, maybe I wanna punch your back.

0:41:19.220,0:41:23.100
So you punch 1, punch and then you just dodge.

0:41:23.100,0:41:31.360
Right, 1, 2 and then I just go down, 1, 2. So obviously, what you are doing now - it is also part of stretching.

0:41:31.360,0:41:38.100
Right. So you just go 1, 2. Then I go, then you say 2 twice. 1,2.

0:41:38.100,0:41:44.280
1,2. This is interesting.

0:41:44.280,0:41:51.160
Maybe he wants to 1 or 2 times there.

0:41:51.160,0:41:57.160
He is a grandpa. This will be awesome.

0:41:57.160,0:42:01.620
Viewers around the world, we've got some lessons from Coach Claude.Take some notes.

0:42:01.620,0:42:06.620
So instead I will ask you to face the other side now, we wanna do something different.

0:42:06.620,0:42:12.900
Ok. Right, 1, 2. - This is what the grannies are doing?

0:42:12.920,0:42:23.180
1,2. So I can still go down. 1,2. Up 1,2. So at the same time, as you can see,

0:42:23.180,0:42:27.580
it's part of your stretching. - I can feel in the back. It's really stretching the back.

0:42:27.580,0:42:32.120
It's very good. So those are some of the things that you can also do at home.

0:42:32.120,0:42:35.620
Alright, thanks coach Claude, for the demonstration and the lesson.

0:42:35.620,0:42:43.600
Thank you. You are more than welcome.

0:42:43.600,0:42:45.720
Thank you for joining us on Changing Lives.

0:42:45.720,0:42:47.520
Thank you. It is well.

0:42:47.520,0:42:49.900
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.

0:42:49.900,0:42:52.720
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:42:52.720,0:42:56.380
Lets go.

0:42:56.380,0:43:03.960
I love boxing because it keeps me healthy and I feel I get fit and I feel young.

0:43:03.960,0:43:11.500
South Africa's Boxing Grannies

0:43:11.500,0:43:18.480
Viewers, thank you so much for joining us. We believe that you have been encouraged by Claude's testimony.

0:43:18.480,0:43:24.280
Knowing that each day, as we overcome our challenges, we make history

0:43:24.280,0:43:27.020
and then fulfill our destinies thereby.

0:43:27.020,0:43:33.900
Therefore, if God gives you a vision and it is opposed by men, please, do not reduce your vision.

0:43:33.900,0:43:36.620
But stay in the will of God.

0:43:36.620,0:43:41.480
Also be encouraged to know that whatever you have in your hands today,

0:43:41.480,0:43:45.820
is enough to create the future that God has promised you.

0:43:45.820,0:43:51.540
But you know what - a seed can not multiply, unless it is planted.

0:43:51.540,0:43:58.020
One fundamental lesson we take from Claude's life experience is that those who are placed on a horse,

0:43:58.020,0:44:01.980
should not forget those who can not ride on a donkey.

0:44:01.980,0:44:05.980
And this simply means that the privileged should remember the less privileged.

0:44:05.980,0:44:11.360
Therefore viewers, what do you have to give? It could be your time,

0:44:11.360,0:44:17.340
it could be your love, it could be your smile, it could be your finances,

0:44:17.340,0:44:23.140
it could even be your boxing gloves. I mean, every good thing that God has given you -

0:44:23.140,0:44:29.540
find those who need you and build your life around your contribution to others.

0:44:29.560,0:44:35.640
So where are your elderly ones? Look for them. Find them and care for them

0:44:35.640,0:44:38.280
and you will reach old age.

0:44:38.280,0:44:43.780
We thank you very much for joining us on this episode of Changing Lives. From me, Justin,

0:44:43.780,0:44:47.420
and from me, Ann - remain blessed.

You know this guy, we love him so much, Claude is everything in our lives.

0:44:55.520,0:45:04.740
He is a good coach. I hope he will be here forever. Because without him maybe I wouldn't be here by this time.

0:45:04.740,0:45:14.840

0:45:14.840,0:45:21.200
Boxing is not easy, but what they do is super awesome.

0:45:21.200,0:45:24.380
Punching, their fists - they can knock you down.

0:45:24.380,0:45:26.360
They are my super grannies.
