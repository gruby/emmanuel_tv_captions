0:00:00.000,0:00:02.580
Good morning, church!

0:00:02.580,0:00:03.980
[Good morning.]

0:00:03.980,0:00:06.980
ACTING ON THE WORD

0:00:06.980,0:00:08.060
Hallelujah.

0:00:08.060,0:00:10.580
[Amen.]

0:00:10.580,0:00:30.280
Acting on the Word demands for believing and believing demands action – creates action.

0:00:30.280,0:00:32.460
It is not just mental assent.

0:00:32.460,0:00:39.500
It does not just admire or admit without acting upon it.

0:00:39.500,0:00:43.540
Action!

0:00:43.540,0:00:47.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:47.620,0:00:54.260
Now, it is time to bring Jesus one the scene.

0:00:54.260,0:01:00.660
The direction to follow - you have seen it all.

0:01:00.660,0:01:05.840
How do we bring Jesus on the scene?

0:01:05.840,0:01:10.000
When you say, "In Jesus' name" and Jesus would just come.

0:01:10.000,0:01:12.980
Ask your neighbour, “How do we bring Jesus on the scene?”

0:01:12.980,0:01:14.840
[How do we bring Jesus on the scene?]

0:01:14.840,0:01:15.920
I cannot hear you.

0:01:15.920,0:01:18.160
[How do we bring Jesus on the scene?]

0:01:18.160,0:01:19.180
I cannot hear you.

0:01:19.180,0:01:20.980
[How do we bring Jesus on the scene?]

0:01:20.980,0:01:22.520
How do we bring Jesus on the scene?

0:01:22.520,0:01:28.340
There are many: "be healed, be delivered, amen" but Jesus is not there.

0:01:28.340,0:01:30.220
You are just saying words.

0:01:30.220,0:01:35.080
There is a difference between praying prayer and saying words.

0:01:35.080,0:01:36.440
There is a difference between what?

0:01:36.440,0:01:45.980
Praying prayer and saying words.

0:01:45.980,0:01:54.920
Acting on the Word is letting Christ act through you.

0:01:54.920,0:01:56.000
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:56.000,0:02:03.560
[Acting on the Word is letting Christ act through you.]

0:02:03.560,0:02:20.960
I mean, acting on the Word then gives Christ an opportunity to heal, deliver and set you free.

0:02:20.960,0:02:23.160
Action!

0:02:23.160,0:02:36.260
He is looking for an opportunity to eat with you, talk to you, greet you; "How are you?", to touch you,

0:02:36.260,0:02:40.500
to live with you - just an opportunity.

0:02:40.500,0:02:52.980
By acting on the Word then gives Christ an opportunity.

0:02:52.980,0:03:10.440
By looking into the Word and acting on it will bring Christ on the scene.

0:03:10.440,0:03:23.780
The problem of believing is made easy when you know that it is acting on what God has spoken.

0:03:23.780,0:03:24.780
Repeat after me.

0:03:24.780,0:03:38.800
The problem of believing is made easy when you know that it is acting on what God has spoken -

0:03:38.800,0:03:42.340
very very...

0:03:42.340,0:03:44.380
it is made simple.

0:03:44.380,0:03:50.660
Faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.

0:03:50.660,0:04:03.740
The problem of believing is made very simple when you know that it is acting on what Jesus has spoken.

0:04:03.740,0:04:09.100
Love your neighbour as yourself, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal -

0:04:09.100,0:04:14.060
just act on those things - the commandments.

0:04:14.060,0:04:23.020
It is so simple, when you know that it is acting on what He has spoken.

0:04:23.020,0:04:28.100
You will be talking about me but you cannot behave like me.

0:04:28.100,0:04:36.860
If you are saying, "T.B. Joshua is this and that" - this is all you know about me.

0:04:36.860,0:04:40.020
But what of my behavior?

0:04:40.020,0:04:43.240
I can run - can you run?

0:04:43.240,0:04:48.300
I can laugh - will you also laugh?

0:04:48.300,0:04:51.280
I can dance - can you dance?

0:04:51.280,0:04:54.040
T.B. Joshua can run - can you run?

0:04:54.040,0:04:58.040
If you cannot run - you do not know T.B. Joshua.

0:04:58.040,0:05:02.000
This is the problem we are having in our faith today.

0:05:02.000,0:05:06.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:06.760,0:05:08.160
Say, "Action!"

0:05:08.160,0:05:09.180
[Action!]

0:05:09.180,0:05:15.880
Believing demands action – creates action.

0:05:15.880,0:05:19.080
That is believing.

0:05:19.080,0:05:24.460
We are hearers but not doers.

0:05:24.460,0:05:34.140
Since you are a hearer, you just have sense knowledge – mental assent.

0:05:34.140,0:05:41.420
Being just a hearer and not a doer – if there is anything you have faith in, it is in man;

0:05:41.420,0:05:46.400
what man has done – science, works and organization.

0:05:46.400,0:05:48.680
These are the things you can have faith in - not in God.

0:05:48.680,0:05:55.220
To have faith in God, you must be a doer of the Word.

0:05:55.220,0:05:57.840
If you are a doer, you have faith in God

0:05:57.840,0:06:03.240
but if you are just a hearer of the Word, if there is anything you have faith in,

0:06:03.240,0:06:14.100
is in man – what man has done, science, works and organization and more.

0:06:14.100,0:06:23.040
These are the things you can have faith in because you are not a doer of the Word.

0:06:23.040,0:06:36.240
That is why you can build a big beautiful church, you can organize things, you are a good organizer,

0:06:36.240,0:06:43.180
you can plan an organization or church, you can build a big building...

0:06:43.180,0:06:49.240
Science - yes, you can make things happen just like that.

0:06:49.240,0:06:51.840
These are man's natural gifts.

0:06:51.840,0:06:58.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:58.100,0:07:12.780
This does not necessarily demand for an obedience to God to be endowed naturally.

0:07:12.780,0:07:20.740
You learn, you study, you pay the price.

0:07:20.740,0:07:25.080
Can you see now why it is difficult for you to have faith in God?

0:07:25.080,0:07:36.260
You hear and study the Word of God, you commit it to memory, not in your heart.

0:07:36.260,0:07:46.980
If there is anything you have faith in - it is in what man has done.

0:07:46.980,0:07:53.800
These are the things you have faith in because you are a hearer and not a doer.

0:07:53.800,0:07:58.940
That is "a sense knowledge, mental assent" which I describe as

0:07:58.940,0:08:09.420
"admires, admits but does not act on the Word".

0:08:09.420,0:08:14.640
I admire your look, you look good.

0:08:14.640,0:08:18.560
That does not mean I can die for you.

0:08:18.560,0:08:20.480
There is an extent I can go...

0:08:20.480,0:08:25.420
These are the reasons you look at the appearance when you want to marry.

0:08:25.420,0:08:35.060
The man is rich, looks handsome, the lady looks beautiful - they have some outward qualities.

0:08:35.060,0:08:38.320
This is mental assent.

0:08:38.320,0:08:48.440
If you go now “by believing” to marry somebody and carry God along, you demand for action,

0:08:48.440,0:08:55.500
create an action - and this must come from your heart.

0:08:55.500,0:09:00.500
The Bible says that what does not come from the heart is a sin.

0:09:00.500,0:09:03.600
Action must come from your heart.

0:09:03.600,0:09:07.380
Heart.

0:09:07.380,0:09:15.600
The love of the heart is love of God.

0:09:15.600,0:09:18.260
Tell your neighbour, “I have found the secret”.

0:09:18.260,0:09:19.860
[I have found the secret.]

0:09:19.860,0:09:20.720
I cannot hear you.

0:09:20.720,0:09:22.440
[I have found the secret.]

0:09:22.440,0:09:23.460
I cannot hear you.

0:09:23.460,0:09:25.160
[I have found the secret.]

0:09:25.160,0:09:32.600
Let the Word be loosed in you, let the Word dominate you,

0:09:32.600,0:09:38.300
let the Word rule you, let the Word live in you.

0:09:38.400,0:09:41.340
These are the secrets.

0:09:41.340,0:09:45.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:45.860,0:09:49.060
I have found the secret.

0:09:49.060,0:09:58.880
Let the Word rule you, let the Word be loosed in you, let the Word dominate you, let the Word live in you -

0:09:58.880,0:10:07.280
These are the secrets of bringing Jesus on the scene.

0:10:07.280,0:10:09.400
The secret of bringing what?

0:10:09.400,0:10:12.820
[These are the secrets of bringing Jesus on the scene.]

0:10:12.820,0:10:19.600
Each time you call, "Jesus!" - people around would hear you, you would hear yourself but Jesus does not what?

0:10:19.600,0:10:20.460
[Hear you.]

0:10:20.460,0:10:23.240
Does not hear you - that is very frustrating.

0:10:23.240,0:10:30.160
This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva; when Jesus could not hear them - what happened?

0:10:30.160,0:10:37.480
The demon jumped on them and said, "Paul I know, Jesus I know; but who are you?"

0:10:37.480,0:10:39.720
They started beating them.

0:10:39.720,0:10:45.600
If Jesus heard them Jesus would be there to act for them, to defend them, to protect them.

0:10:45.600,0:10:47.440
OK, take your pen and write,

0:10:47.440,0:10:53.540
“The secret of bringing Jesus on the scene, I have found it today.”

0:10:53.540,0:10:55.480
I cannot hear you.

0:10:55.480,0:11:02.660
I have found the secret, the secret of bringing Jesus on the scene:

0:11:02.660,0:11:16.720
Let the Word be loosed in you, let the Word dominate you, let the Word rule you, let the Word live in you.

0:11:16.720,0:11:18.660
That is the secret.

0:11:18.660,0:11:21.280
That is just the secret.

0:11:21.280,0:11:26.680
Loose is  l o o s e.

0:11:26.680,0:11:30.820
Once you have this; you will be eating with Jesus...

0:11:30.820,0:11:34.740
When you say "Jesus!", 
He will reply, "What do you want?"

0:11:34.740,0:11:38.300
You would say, "Be healed!"

0:11:38.300,0:11:41.900
You say, "Jesus!", He would reply, 
"- What do you want?

0:11:41.900,0:11:48.000
- I want you to come sleep with me.
- OK, don't worry. Give me another pillow."

0:11:48.000,0:11:49.960
[Hallelujah]

0:11:49.960,0:11:53.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:53.360,0:12:03.140
You can see the reason why you are just calling yourself every day instead of Jesus.

0:12:03.140,0:12:05.700
If you don’t give, you don’t receive.

0:12:05.700,0:12:23.960
In this case now, you have to give to receive; not money – your quality time, strength and love.

0:12:23.960,0:12:33.880
You must give your quality time to the Word of God, your quality love to the Word of God.

0:12:33.880,0:12:37.380
If you were not here but at home - where can you go?

0:12:37.380,0:12:39.640
Can you go to work today?

0:12:39.640,0:12:41.400
Can you go to the bank?

0:12:41.400,0:12:47.700
Today is not your quality time.

0:12:47.700,0:12:50.760
You know what I'm talking about.

0:12:50.760,0:12:53.540
Today is not your quality time.

0:12:53.540,0:12:58.700
Your quality time is when you are in between a billion dollars...

0:12:58.700,0:13:04.920
Here is prayer and somebody is calling you, 
"- Hey, come and receive this.

0:13:04.920,0:13:12.760
- No, I want to pray. When I finish the prayer I will come.
- If you come after prayer you will miss the money.

0:13:12.760,0:13:15.440
- OK, let me miss the money. Let me pray first."

0:13:15.440,0:13:18.340
How many of us can do that?

0:13:18.340,0:13:22.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:22.280,0:13:29.300
Choice can be the greatest gift you have.

0:13:29.300,0:13:35.300
There are many of us today that were supposed to be here and I can see that one or two them are not around.

0:13:35.300,0:13:43.600
By the time you meet them, they will say that while they were coming to the church they received a phone call

0:13:43.600,0:13:50.940
that their dear one was in coma.

0:13:50.940,0:13:54.200
It is a time for a choice now.

0:13:54.200,0:14:00.840
Would you choose to go to your dear one that is in coma or come to God?

0:14:00.840,0:14:05.780
Who is the Creator of the one that is in coma?

0:14:05.780,0:14:13.460
God is not one of those things, He is the Only one.

0:14:13.460,0:14:16.760
Even your coming here can revive the one in coma.

0:14:16.760,0:14:18.060
[Amen.]

0:14:18.060,0:14:25.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:25.020,0:14:33.280
You don't put God where God belongs - that is the problem you are having now.

0:14:33.280,0:14:37.500
In the house of many of us - we don't have an altar.

0:14:37.500,0:14:48.480
You are leaving the church now, you get back home; the morning water you received - you take it there.

0:14:48.480,0:14:53.700
Your Bible, your booklet you received you place it there.

0:14:53.700,0:14:58.420
Before you enter your room or any other place, you go straight to the altar -

0:14:58.420,0:15:02.200
you go on your knees at the table of your altar -

0:15:02.200,0:15:10.500
you place everything you have received today (morning water...) on the table with your Bible

0:15:10.500,0:15:14.720
and give thanks to God for giving you the grace to come back home.

0:15:14.720,0:15:19.660
It is like you believe that Angels of God have followed from here; you take them back to your altar

0:15:19.660,0:15:23.160
to stay there for you - when you are going home...

0:15:23.160,0:15:28.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:28.880,0:15:40.380
When you just get home to your sitting room, bedroom you hang your clothes - "where is my food?"

0:15:40.380,0:15:42.340
You don't have an altar.

0:15:42.340,0:15:52.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:52.340,0:15:59.060
Sometimes, you just have a revelation that you want to fast and pray today

0:15:59.060,0:16:02.960
and you will only be at the altar there that day.

0:16:02.960,0:16:09.740
You tell your family, "I'm there" - you just lay down there and pray.

0:16:09.740,0:16:15.900
An altar should be a place where you should give the highest regard to God.

0:16:15.900,0:16:22.520
We see God as one of those things... No - He is the only, not one of those things.

0:16:22.520,0:16:28.080
Don't restrict God with arrangements you make.

0:16:28.080,0:16:32.660
That is why it is difficult for me to wear an expensive watch.

0:16:32.660,0:16:37.640
Because I cannot "time" God.

0:16:37.640,0:16:41.520
If I have a watch I will not look at it when I am in the presence of God.

0:16:41.520,0:16:42.720
I will not "time" Him.

0:16:42.720,0:16:47.260
He should tell me when to start and when to finish, or when I should leave here.

0:16:47.260,0:16:52.940
I should not to begin to look at the watch, "oh, this is twelve o'clock..."

0:16:52.940,0:16:54.740
I don't "time" Him.

0:16:54.740,0:16:59.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:59.560,0:17:08.200
These are the steps we are ignorantly taking and we say that we are serving God.

0:17:08.200,0:17:13.740
You are not serving God - it is God who is serving you.

0:17:13.740,0:17:18.960
Now, I’m looking at you; I can’t see anyone among you holding this.

0:17:18.960,0:17:27.320
While I'm talking I continue to "fire on" - and that is the purpose of it.

0:17:27.320,0:17:31.600
While I'm talking, you should also be in an attitude of prayer by saying,

0:17:31.600,0:17:35.900
"take more of me Lord, give me more of You."

0:17:35.900,0:17:44.700
If you cannot do that here, you will definitely forget about it at home while watching TV.

0:17:44.700,0:17:51.920
You should be "counting your faith" while watching TV.

0:17:51.920,0:17:53.520
You must get used to it.

0:17:53.520,0:17:59.620
You must cultivate the habit of building yourself – you need to build yourself.

0:17:59.620,0:18:02.760
When you build yourself, God will take it up -

0:18:02.760,0:18:06.060
God will take you somewhere and start building you

0:18:06.060,0:18:11.360
but you must first of all start building yourself before God can take it up and begin to build you.

0:18:11.360,0:18:14.620
God will not start building you from scratch.

0:18:14.620,0:18:18.660
Look at what happened to Peter  - I keep giving a good example of Peter.

0:18:18.660,0:18:24.500
When Peter wanted to meet Him on the sea, He said, "Come".

0:18:24.500,0:18:26.760
He said, "I want to come with You".

0:18:26.760,0:18:30.980
Jesus said, "Come. Take a step."

0:18:30.980,0:18:37.660
It was the step Peter took and was coming, and started to drown...

0:18:37.660,0:18:41.520
Finally, when he was about to disappear in the sea...

0:18:41.520,0:18:44.580
Jesus allowed him to test his faith.

0:18:44.580,0:18:48.180
Your faith needs to be tested.

0:18:48.180,0:18:55.000
A relationship must go through hard and good times before it can be mature

0:18:55.000,0:19:00.200
before it can be called a relationship.

0:19:00.200,0:19:15.780
If everything goes smoothly on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - I will not wait for Friday

0:19:15.780,0:19:26.320
before going on a fast and pray, "God I am sensing danger."

0:19:26.320,0:19:34.080
This world is not our home; we are only passing through it.

0:19:34.080,0:19:51.540
You are doing a business; big profits from Monday to Thursday - you know you are walking towards danger.

0:19:51.540,0:19:58.840
That profit - something is coming to destroy all the profit you made from Monday to Thursday.

0:19:58.840,0:20:01.880
You have to pause.

0:20:01.880,0:20:11.080
You may not even go to work on Friday because the profit is alarming.

0:20:11.080,0:20:19.200
Monday - profit, Tuesday - profit, Wednesday - profit, Thursday - profit; don't go to work on Friday.

0:20:19.200,0:20:21.220
Avoid what?

0:20:21.220,0:20:23.200
Avoid profit - tell your neighbour.

0:20:23.200,0:20:24.700
[Avoid profit.]

0:20:24.700,0:20:27.340
That profit may be dangerous.

0:20:27.340,0:20:28.340
Just avoid profit.

0:20:28.340,0:20:32.700
Say, "No. Lock the shop. Don't come to my shop and buy - no."

0:20:32.700,0:20:35.340
When someone comes to your shop asking, "Where is that gentleman?"

0:20:35.340,0:20:39.360
they would answer, "He is not around; the shop is not open today."

0:20:39.360,0:20:45.220
Yes, go fast and pray.

0:20:45.220,0:20:52.960
“In this world, there will be tribulation; cheer up, I have overcome for you!”

0:20:52.960,0:20:54.280
[Amen.]

0:20:54.280,0:21:01.760
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:01.760,0:21:06.260
Because you don't know you are in the world.

0:21:06.260,0:21:15.140
You don't know how the Bible describes that world to us - believers.

0:21:15.140,0:21:19.900
This world is not my home - sing it for them. 
Let them listen to that song.

0:21:19.900,0:21:28.140
This world is not my home
I’m just passing through

0:21:28.140,0:21:36.380
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue

0:21:36.380,0:21:43.780
The angels beckon me
From Heaven’s open doors

0:21:43.780,0:21:51.340
And I can’t feel at home
In this world any more

0:21:51.340,0:22:00.900
This world is not my home
I’m just passing through

0:22:00.900,0:22:07.360
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue

0:22:07.360,0:22:16.860
The angels beckon me
From Heaven’s open doors

0:22:16.860,0:22:25.600
And I can’t feel at home
In this world any more

0:22:25.600,0:22:28.960
You may be seated.

0:22:28.960,0:22:45.360
Crises, situations, if you are a Christian, are friends and not your enemies.

0:22:45.360,0:22:51.800
When you begin to see your situation as a friend, you will overcome it.

0:22:51.800,0:23:00.660
Because you know you are the cause of your situation, that is why you see it as an enemy but it is not.

0:23:00.660,0:23:04.420
They are meant to promote you.

0:23:04.420,0:23:08.180
The examination you are doing for promotion, are they enemies?

0:23:08.180,0:23:08.920
[No.]

0:23:08.920,0:23:13.060
That is the way, that is the life.

0:23:13.060,0:23:19.460
You have done a lot of examinations to be where you are today.

0:23:19.460,0:23:25.120
Examinations are not enemies; they are enemies when you are not prepared for them.

0:23:25.120,0:23:29.180
When the examination comes and you are not prepared, it becomes an enemy to you

0:23:29.180,0:23:34.540
but when you prepare for an examination, you pray, you are happy – it is your friend.

0:23:34.540,0:23:36.320
Everybody - people pray...

0:23:36.320,0:23:43.840
Those who want to be promoted pray for examination all the time because they want to be promoted.

0:23:43.840,0:23:48.040
When the examination comes and you pass, you’re promoted;

0:23:48.040,0:23:51.220
that is the situation to you, Christians.

0:23:51.220,0:24:00.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:00.080,0:24:06.840
Your situations are friends; they are meant to promote you.

0:24:06.840,0:24:11.540
In the world, examination promotes when you pass

0:24:11.540,0:24:18.140
but in the spirit, you cannot remain stagnant; you need to be promoted.

0:24:18.140,0:24:28.120
The situation can be any type of situation; it depends on how it is designed - as it should be by divine will.

0:24:28.120,0:24:41.220
Your situation could be sickness, poverty, hardship, infirmity, disappointment.

0:24:41.220,0:24:45.660
Situations are meant for our spiritual benefit.

0:24:45.660,0:24:46.760
Tell your neighbour.

0:24:46.760,0:24:50.060
[Situations are meant for our spiritual benefit.]

0:24:50.060,0:24:53.060
Yes.

0:24:53.060,0:25:00.960
They are meant for your spiritual benefit, for your spiritual growth.

0:25:00.960,0:25:10.380
Your situation could be this, could be that; sickness, disappointment...

0:25:10.380,0:25:19.920
When you sit down and you cannot define the cause of your situation...

0:25:19.920,0:25:25.600
All of us here that have a situation know the cause of your situation.

0:25:25.600,0:25:31.900
You know how many people you have duped in the past.

0:25:31.900,0:25:46.520
You know, out there how you met a spiritualist to collect concoction, charm

0:25:46.520,0:25:51.460
and dropped it on the seat of your boss, so that your boss can be removed,

0:25:51.460,0:25:54.840
so that you can take over the position.

0:25:54.840,0:26:04.780
You know how you decided to gang up against your boss and you took a report or petition

0:26:04.780,0:26:10.060
to the authority, lying against your boss.

0:26:10.060,0:26:14.940
At the end of the day the boss was fired.

0:26:14.940,0:26:17.960
You are promoted to the position.

0:26:17.960,0:26:23.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:23.120,0:26:30.740
You know you are a drunkard; you can drink a lot of alcohol.

0:26:30.740,0:26:37.860
If there is a damage in your organs, don't call it spiritual benefit.

0:26:37.860,0:26:44.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:26:44.500,0:26:52.780
It is not a spiritual benefit - it is to kill you; if God doesn't intervene.

0:26:52.780,0:26:54.400
I'm talking of...

0:26:54.400,0:27:08.280
When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and you renounce your past and follow Him,

0:27:08.280,0:27:14.420
whatever situation you are facing is for your spiritual benefit.

0:27:14.420,0:27:21.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:21.060,0:27:22.620
Are you with me?

0:27:22.620,0:27:27.200
Let's stand up and hear this.

0:27:27.200,0:27:34.340
The day you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, with all your heart –

0:27:34.340,0:27:43.360
when I say "with all your heart" I mean - you mean it.

0:27:43.360,0:27:46.620
You know - some of us, we don't mean what we are saying.

0:27:46.620,0:27:59.820
The day you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, with all your heart – you mean it

0:27:59.820,0:28:08.780
and you follow Him, whatever situation whatever challenges you will be facing

0:28:08.780,0:28:11.480
after accepting Jesus as your Lord and Saviour -

0:28:11.480,0:28:15.440
Jesus never said that when you accept Him, you will not face challenges,

0:28:15.440,0:28:20.580
this is why He said, “I pray your faith will not fail!”

0:28:20.580,0:28:22.080
[Amen.]

0:28:22.080,0:28:29.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:29.460,0:28:39.380
He was talking to His disciples and insisted, "I pray, your faith, Simon, will not fail."

0:28:39.380,0:28:44.080
It means that something is coming, that will challenge their faith.

0:28:44.080,0:28:45.360
What can challenge our faith?

0:28:45.360,0:28:46.580
Situations.

0:28:46.580,0:28:47.820
What can challenge our faith?

0:28:47.820,0:28:48.680
Satan.

0:28:48.680,0:28:50.040
What can challenge our faith?

0:28:50.040,0:28:58.540
Mess and stupid things – could be sickness, disease, disappointment, setback, infirmity.

0:28:58.540,0:29:05.220
"I pray your faith will not fail" - it means that something is coming that will challenge their faith,

0:29:05.220,0:29:11.480
that will make them say, "Will I continue to follow this man, or should I go back to the world?"

0:29:11.480,0:29:17.240
That is temptation, He was talking about.

0:29:17.240,0:29:23.480
The day you accept Him and you mean it with all your heart...

0:29:23.480,0:29:30.640
He never said that when you accept Him, you will not face tribulation, trouble and challenges.

0:29:30.640,0:29:41.100
There will be challenges; those challenges are meant for your spiritual benefit because you are not alone.

0:29:41.100,0:29:42.640
Tell your neighbour, "I am not alone".

0:29:42.640,0:29:43.760
[I am not alone.]

0:29:43.760,0:29:44.660
I cannot hear you.

0:29:44.660,0:29:45.980
[I am not alone.]

0:29:45.980,0:29:47.540
So, why are you afraid?

0:29:47.540,0:29:52.580
Why are you living as a Christian, as if there will no more be challenges or temptations?

0:29:52.580,0:29:57.460
There will be trouble and situations

0:29:57.460,0:30:03.820
but those situations, challenges and temptations are meant for your spiritual benefit.

0:30:03.820,0:30:07.340
Benefit means to promote you.

0:30:07.340,0:30:14.300
When you face a situation, you are not alone; after that situation, you are up.

0:30:14.300,0:30:19.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:19.900,0:30:23.860
We Christians cannot pray for challenges.

0:30:23.860,0:30:28.340
We cannot just sit and begin to say, "Temptation should come."

0:30:28.340,0:30:35.160
It is something we could be demanding for because they are promotion.

0:30:35.160,0:30:41.240
You know the way you are looking for a promotion out there - you know.

0:30:41.240,0:30:46.060
Outside there you know how desperate you are to be promoted.

0:30:46.060,0:30:52.880
If it was possible, you would like to be promoted everyday.

0:30:52.880,0:30:57.200
If it is possible, everyday you want to seek for an examination.

0:30:57.200,0:31:09.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:09.440,0:31:14.000
I want to give you a key that will help your life.

0:31:14.000,0:31:22.380
Anytime you are facing a situation or challenges, it is time to honour Jesus before men.

0:31:22.380,0:31:24.960
Do you honour Him?

0:31:24.960,0:31:34.320
Look, I may be having pain here now - it is time to be happy before men.

0:31:34.320,0:31:38.000
I will be happy before men.

0:31:38.000,0:31:46.540
Anytime you are facing challenges of any kind, it is time to honour Jesus before who?

0:31:46.540,0:31:47.480
[Men.]

0:31:47.480,0:31:49.440
Before men.

0:31:49.440,0:31:57.580
It is only when you want a contract, you honour Jesus before men.

0:31:57.580,0:32:02.600
What satan wants for you when situations come – he wants you to be sad;

0:32:02.600,0:32:10.340
that is what he wants and that sadness is not permitted by the Holy Spirit

0:32:10.340,0:32:17.120
because the Holy Spirit wants a free spirit to operate.

0:32:17.120,0:32:24.100
Your spirit must be free and if our spirit is free, joy and happiness comes

0:32:24.100,0:32:28.400
but when you are not free, your spirit is not free and you are worried,

0:32:28.400,0:32:36.800
forget about it– that is not for the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is not allowed at that moment.

0:32:36.800,0:32:42.440
So, satan wants you to be sad all the time because he knows what it means to be sad;

0:32:42.440,0:32:50.000
to be sad is to be out of God; to be unhappy is to be out of God.

0:32:50.000,0:32:54.520
He knows that when you are sad, you are out of God

0:32:54.520,0:32:58.180
and he doesn’t want you to be with God, he wants you to be out of God.

0:32:58.180,0:33:02.280
When you are not happy, you are out of God.

0:33:02.280,0:33:05.880
That is why that situation will come.

0:33:05.880,0:33:10.900
When you are happy; suddenly you receive a phone call, "Do you know that this thing happened?"

0:33:10.900,0:33:13.680
Suddenly sadness comes.

0:33:13.680,0:33:17.060
The joy that was there before is gone.

0:33:17.060,0:33:20.220
Jesus is gone - satan enters.

0:33:20.220,0:33:25.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:25.260,0:33:33.200
Jesus must be honoured 
Must be honoured must be honoured

0:33:33.200,0:33:42.360
Jesus must be honoured 
In my life every day

0:33:42.360,0:33:51.220
Jesus must be honoured 
Must be honoured must be honoured

0:33:51.220,0:34:01.620
Jesus must be honoured 
In my life every day

0:34:01.620,0:34:06.220
When you are not happy, you can’t make any good decision.

0:34:06.220,0:34:12.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:12.540,0:34:19.400
It means, you cannot pray and if you try to pray, you are praying to yourself -

0:34:19.400,0:34:23.660
people around you will hear you but God will not hear you.

0:34:23.660,0:34:32.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:34:32.580,0:34:44.780
Can you see the need to be happy and joyful even when there is nothing to be happy about;

0:34:44.780,0:34:47.300
you just have to be happy.

0:34:47.300,0:34:52.840
What satan wants to achieve is to take you out of God.

0:34:52.840,0:35:01.440
The moment you are not happy, you are out of God; he can attack you and have access to you.

0:35:01.440,0:35:05.700
The only time satan has access to you is when you are not happy.

0:35:05.700,0:35:10.320
When you are happy, satan cannot have access to you.

0:35:10.320,0:35:12.580
I am not saying, “Create happiness”.

0:35:12.580,0:35:19.760
You can create happiness when you go to beer parlour begin to drink, to smoke to be happy...

0:35:19.760,0:35:26.000
That is happiness you created by yourself.

0:35:26.000,0:35:32.520
Or you go to a party, begin to dance - you create that happiness; I am not talking about that happiness.

0:35:32.520,0:35:41.920
I am talking about a natural one that comes as a result of your deeds.

0:35:41.920,0:35:48.580
The medicine of your situation is happiness.

0:35:48.580,0:35:55.560
The happiness you had before your situation, don’t quit it.

0:35:55.560,0:36:00.200
When a situation comes, you can still hold on to your joy.

0:36:00.200,0:36:10.300
Quickly remember what the Bible says, “In this world, amidst that tribulation, cheer up!”

0:36:10.300,0:36:16.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:36:16.240,0:36:25.820
Amidst - in the middle of that situation - that is the word, "cheer up".

0:36:25.820,0:36:30.600
C h e e r

0:36:30.600,0:36:43.360
In the middle, midst of that trouble, bad news, attack – you are inside that serious attack,

0:36:43.360,0:36:52.520
don’t forget, He said, “Cheer up! Be happy! That will make Me to have access to you”.

0:36:52.520,0:36:56.220
Because he wants to have access to you while you are in trouble

0:36:56.220,0:37:02.880
and to have access to you, you have to be happy in that trouble, so that He can come and rescue you.

0:37:02.880,0:37:10.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:10.100,0:37:14.660
These are the decisions we need to make when we follow Him.

0:37:14.660,0:37:31.380
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus

0:37:31.380,0:37:51.300
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back no turning back

0:37:51.300,0:37:57.360
Someone is coming to know whether you mean it.

0:37:57.360,0:38:08.040
Someone came to God and asked Him, “Let me go to this man to know whether he means it.”

0:38:08.040,0:38:16.620
Satan came to God, "Please, allow me. I mean this man doesn't mean it. He said he follows - he doesn't mean it."

0:38:16.620,0:38:21.160
God answered, " - He means it.
- OK, allow me. Let me confirm whether he means it"

0:38:21.160,0:38:29.280
When he is coming to you, he can come with sickness, attack or whatever to show whether you mean it.

0:38:29.280,0:38:31.360
If you mean what you said.

0:38:31.360,0:38:40.460
If you mean it with all your heart, the more that attack, the more your desire for God.

The more that temptation, the more your desire for God

0:38:50.600,0:38:53.760
but when you don’t mean it and the attack comes,

0:38:53.760,0:39:00.420
you will look back and begin to see Jesus in a bad light.

0:39:00.420,0:39:07.700
"Where I am coming from, there is nothing like this; I thought when I accept this man - no problem."

0:39:07.700,0:39:12.100
Take care of yourself; someone is coming to confirm whether you mean it

0:39:12.100,0:39:20.100
and he will not stop coming; his coming is to promote you if you mean it.

0:39:20.100,0:39:29.280
Tell your neighbour, "If you mean it, he is coming to promote you".

Can't you hear what Paul said in the Book of Romans?

0:39:38.320,0:39:41.240
“What can separate me from the love of God?”

0:39:41.240,0:39:47.580
Because he meant it; he said it with all his heart.

0:39:47.580,0:40:00.060
Indeed, trouble and tribulation came; there was nothing that did not come to Paul

0:40:00.060,0:40:04.000
but the more those things, the more his desire for God.

What can separate me from the love of Christ?

0:40:13.380,0:40:14.260
Can disease?

0:40:14.260,0:40:14.980
[No.]

0:40:14.980,0:40:15.820
Can affliction?

0:40:15.820,0:40:16.520
[No.]

0:40:16.520,0:40:17.300
Can poverty?

0:40:17.300,0:40:17.900
[No.]

0:40:17.900,0:40:18.700
Can hardship?

0:40:18.700,0:40:19.360
[No.]

0:40:19.360,0:40:20.160
Can death?

0:40:20.160,0:40:20.940
[No.]

0:40:20.940,0:40:22.360
What can separate me?

0:40:22.360,0:40:24.300
[Nothing.]

0:40:24.300,0:40:28.140
If you mean it!

0:40:28.140,0:40:30.520
You may be seated - thank you.

The hardship in your nation, the attack on Christians or whatever cannot separate you from the love of God,

0:40:41.040,0:40:46.900
rather, it strengthens your desire.

0:40:46.900,0:40:53.200
What is holy is what we attack and what is dirty we don’t attack.

0:40:53.200,0:41:01.020
Tell your neighbour, “What is holy, what is awesome, we attack.”

0:41:01.020,0:41:05.000
If you are not worth it, no-one will attack you.

0:41:05.000,0:41:11.780
There are many people on the street; they live on the street, they sleep on the street, they live under the bridge,

0:41:11.780,0:41:15.540
they sleep outside; nobody attacks them.

0:41:15.540,0:41:20.980
Attack on you is to show your potential, your value.

0:41:20.980,0:41:24.840
The more the attack the more your value.

0:41:24.840,0:41:33.300
If you are worth it, you deserve attack from those who are not worth it.

0:41:33.300,0:41:39.760
You can never envy someone who is below you but someone above you.

0:41:39.760,0:41:41.940
Do you still envy those who are below you?

0:41:41.940,0:41:42.660
[No.]

0:41:42.660,0:41:45.400
Who are the people you envy?

0:41:45.400,0:41:53.100
Someone is also envying you and that envy can lead to attack; that envy can lead to death.

0:41:53.100,0:41:58.640
Therefore, you have decided to follow Jesus – meant it!

0:41:58.640,0:41:59.800
Tell your neighbour, "Mean it!"

0:41:59.800,0:42:00.960
[Mean it!]

0:42:00.960,0:42:10.460
Someone is coming to ask you, someone is coming to confirm – mean it!
