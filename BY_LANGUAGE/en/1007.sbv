0:00:00.000,0:00:01.460
My name is Victory Imasuen.

0:00:01.460,0:00:06.420
I am a deportee from Libya; me and my colleague.

0:00:06.420,0:00:09.380
I am from Edo State, Nigeria.

0:00:09.380,0:00:12.500
I'm here to share the experience I had in Libya

0:00:12.500,0:00:16.500
and I want to give testimony about what God has done in my life.

0:00:16.500,0:00:26.140
Before I went to Libya, it was very difficult for me to start up something as a young boy.

0:00:26.140,0:00:29.960
When I lost my father at the age of 11, it was only my mother and I

0:00:29.960,0:00:33.880
who could take care of six children.

0:00:33.880,0:00:37.880
During that time, it was not easy for me and my mother.

0:00:37.880,0:00:41.520
I had to take the step of faith to see if there was anything that I could do to assist my mother.

0:00:41.520,0:00:47.540
So, I did all sorts of jobs and activities to sponsor myself in school.

0:00:47.540,0:00:54.100
After all, I found myself learning how to cut hair.

0:00:54.100,0:01:05.100
Few months later, I became very good at it and I worked as a professional barber.

0:01:05.100,0:01:08.380
One day, I was cutting one of my customers' hair and he advised me saying that

0:01:08.380,0:01:12.980
since I know how to cut very well, if I could go to Europe, I would make it

0:01:12.980,0:01:18.980
and earn a lot of money to take care of my juniors and I would be able to do what I wanted to do.

0:01:18.980,0:01:24.480
I asked him how much it would cost me and he said it was 350,000 Naira.

0:01:24.480,0:01:28.840
I said that I didn't have such a big money and he asked how much I had.

0:01:28.840,0:01:33.880
I said I only had 140,000 Naira which was the money that I had been contributing

0:01:33.880,0:01:40.860
at the end of every month – 10,000 Naira – and that was only I could save out of my salary.

0:01:40.860,0:01:46.020
The man then said that he would help me; if I paid with what I had

0:01:46.020,0:01:50.700
and when I got to Europe, I could pay the remaining money.

0:01:50.700,0:01:53.540
Then I gave him 140,000 Naira.

0:01:53.540,0:01:57.980
We moved from Benin to Kano and from there to Agadez.

0:01:57.980,0:02:01.020
We took a car to the desert.

0:02:01.020,0:02:07.920
On the third day, we were moving in convoy with different passengers

0:02:07.920,0:02:10.960
who were also going to Europe and it was about 30 cars.

0:02:10.960,0:02:19.800
One of the cars had a terrible accident which only two or three passengers were able to survive.

0:02:19.800,0:02:27.620
Then on the fourth day, our water got finished and that was when everything started.

0:02:27.620,0:02:34.560
There was no more water for us to drink and I almost gave up on myself

0:02:34.560,0:02:38.840
but something was telling me that if I gave up on that point, who would take care of my juniors

0:02:38.840,0:02:43.060
who were the reason I started the journey.

0:02:43.060,0:02:51.400
It was as if a force came upon me; I had strength and I was no more thirsty.

0:02:51.400,0:02:55.200
On the sixth day, we arrived in Libya.

0:02:55.200,0:03:02.080
When we got there, the driver said that the trafficker did not pay for our transportation.

0:03:02.080,0:03:04.580
We said that we had already paid our money to him.

0:03:04.580,0:03:06.940
We tried to make a call but to no avail.

0:03:06.940,0:03:12.080
The man said that he was going to sell us into slavery.

0:03:12.080,0:03:18.720
The driver took us to Sabat to sell us into slavery and there were ladies among us.

0:03:18.720,0:03:21.480
We were 11 in number.

0:03:21.480,0:03:27.180
When we got there, we were sold to a Ghanaian man and he took us to his place.

0:03:27.180,0:03:31.600
In his place, there was another underground house in which whenever they beat us

0:03:31.600,0:03:35.860
but even though we shouted, nobody would hear and come to help us.

0:03:35.860,0:03:40.600
When I entered, I met a lot of Nigerians and people from other countries.

0:03:40.600,0:03:48.240
We were locked up in a small room and we were about over 200 people.

0:03:48.240,0:03:51.180
There were also ladies locked up in a room opposite ours.

0:03:51.180,0:03:55.600
The next day, they started beating me saying that I should call my mother to send me money.

0:03:55.600,0:04:01.340
That was the time my mother got to know that I was not in Nigeria because I did not tell her before I left.

0:04:01.340,0:04:04.000
Then she knew that I was not in Nigeria and she asked me where I was.

0:04:04.000,0:04:09.380
I told her that I was in Libya and I explained the situation I was in.

0:04:09.380,0:04:12.160
I told her of the money that they were demanding – 250,000 Naira.

0:04:12.160,0:04:17.200
She said, "I don’t have such a big money. How am I going to get the money?"

0:04:17.200,0:04:21.820
For months, I did not hear from my mother; not even a phone call.

0:04:21.820,0:04:24.800
When there was no call for me, they kept on beating me everyday.

0:04:24.800,0:04:30.800
Even going to the toilet was very difficult at times.

0:04:30.800,0:04:38.080
When I went to use the toilet, it was very painful and discharged blood at that point.

0:04:38.080,0:04:46.480
For the ladies, they would wait three or five days for their money but if the money did not come,

0:04:46.480,0:04:49.740
they would sell the ladies to do prostitution.

0:04:49.740,0:04:53.420
Some women would come to our place to buy the ladies and take them to traffickers

0:04:53.420,0:04:56.240
where they would start prostitution.

0:04:56.240,0:04:59.980
Even though she got to the point where she would be able to pay the money back,

0:04:59.980,0:05:05.760
the traffickers would sell them to another trafficker so that she could start another work.

0:05:05.760,0:05:11.880
I saw such case more than three times.

0:05:11.880,0:05:23.960
On the eighth month, I got freedom back; I paid money and came out of the prison.

0:05:23.960,0:05:29.440
To get to feed myself was very difficult because when I called my mother,

0:05:29.440,0:05:31.680
she said she did not have money for feeding.

0:05:31.680,0:05:40.660
I had to go wherever they sent us to work.

0:05:40.660,0:05:48.860
A lot of ladies became pregnant without knowing the father of the babies

0:05:48.860,0:05:55.500
because they would sleep with men from different countries.

0:05:55.500,0:06:01.460
Due to the prostitution, most of them became pregnant without knowing the father of the child.

0:06:01.460,0:06:06.940
I was working trying to make money to feed myself.

0:06:06.940,0:06:12.660
About two months later, after I came out of the prison, I was able to raise some money

0:06:12.660,0:06:15.700
by working in a barber shop.

0:06:15.700,0:06:25.300
Then, I planned to move to Tripoli to cross the border but before I could get there, I was kidnapped again.

0:06:25.300,0:06:28.500
They said they would deport us back to Nigeria.

0:06:28.500,0:06:40.520
When we got there, they took us to a prison and I met a lot of Nigerians there; more than 10,000.

0:06:40.520,0:06:44.020
The life was very difficult in the prison.

0:06:44.020,0:06:50.220
Even the way we ate – we ate only once in a day; one piece of bread and nothing else.

0:06:50.220,0:06:52.420
Even the water we drank was salt water.

0:06:52.420,0:07:00.300
They decided to deport ladies first and at that point, we asked the ladies

0:07:00.300,0:07:06.680
that whenever they left, they should try to take some men claiming to be their husbands.

0:07:06.680,0:07:12.220
Luckily, one of the ladies took me and claimed that I was her husband.

0:07:12.220,0:07:17.940
That was how I found myself in Tripoli deportee camp before a CNN reporter came.

0:07:17.940,0:07:24.460
I said to myself that I might get some help from this media if I spoke, so I decided to speak

0:07:24.460,0:07:31.660
to CNN and they interviewed me.

0:07:31.660,0:07:33.320
We see on the screens of TVs...

0:07:33.320,0:07:39.420
We have just heard from the brother, who was sharing his experience during his stay in Libya.

0:07:39.420,0:07:42.680
He said that he had left Nigeria as a professional barber.

0:07:42.680,0:07:46.300
After arriving to Libya he went through lot of experiences.

0:07:46.300,0:07:50.160
He ended up in the underground house.

0:07:50.160,0:07:54.940
Many of people there were packed in small cells, which were designed for two persons.

0:07:54.940,0:08:01.640
He was sold to kidnappers who told him that he had to pay the ransom, in order to get his freedom.

0:08:01.640,0:08:07.220
He said it had been by chance that somebody was able to rescue him out, paying the kidnappers the ransom.

0:08:07.220,0:08:11.180
After leaving this place he ended up in a prison.

0:08:11.180,0:08:14.400
From the prison he was sent to the deportation camp.

0:08:14.400,0:08:24.340
While his stay in the deportation camp, the CNN came to make a report on deportees there.

0:08:24.340,0:08:25.940
We just want to ask our brothers...

0:08:25.940,0:08:30.760
On the screen of TV we see our brother.

0:08:30.760,0:08:35.560
Can you just explain what were you doing there?

0:08:35.560,0:08:38.420
On the programme of the TV, I am the one who was talking.

0:08:38.420,0:08:42.760
When CNN came, I decided to speak because I really needed help.

0:08:42.760,0:08:48.060
At the end, nothing came out of it and finally, I was deported to Nigeria

0:08:48.060,0:08:55.660
through IOM (International Organisation for Migration) who assists deportees from Libya.

0:08:55.660,0:09:02.960
I decided to come to The SCOAN

0:09:02.960,0:09:10.360
because even before I left, I heard that The SCOAN renders help to others and also deportees like me.

0:09:10.360,0:09:21.040
I decided to come here to seek prayers because I thought it was because of the curse

0:09:21.040,0:09:26.320
which made it really hard on me and I prayed every curse and poverty in my family would break.

0:09:26.320,0:09:31.080
I would share my testimony of how God brought me back alive.

0:09:31.080,0:09:33.860
I really want to say, "Thank You, Lord" for everything He has done for me.

0:09:33.860,0:09:35.060
We just heard from the brother -

0:09:35.060,0:09:42.320
after he was taken to the deportation camp, the CNN came to interview them about their experiences

0:09:42.320,0:09:44.240
of their journey through Libya.

0:09:44.240,0:09:46.240
He was able to share his experience.

0:09:46.240,0:09:51.980
He was deported back to Nigeria - he was taken to his State

0:09:51.980,0:09:58.960
but he decided to come to Lagos, to The SCOAN, because he knew God would surely use T.B. Joshua

0:09:58.960,0:10:03.280
and Emmanuel TV partners to rescue him out of this terrible conditions,

0:10:03.280,0:10:10.680
that he had found himself in, during his journey by illegal means in Libya.

0:10:10.680,0:10:15.100
That is why he is here today to seek help from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners

0:10:15.100,0:10:17.480
so that he can start his life anew.

0:10:17.480,0:10:19.740
Praise the Lord.

0:10:19.740,0:10:23.300
I'm Osazee Aghimiee.
I'm from Edo State.

0:10:23.300,0:10:27.520
I was a driver before I left Nigeria.

0:10:27.520,0:10:40.320
I have married and have one baby boy who was born just three days before I left Nigeria.

0:10:40.320,0:10:50.400
Suddenly, most of my friends called me and told me that I should come to Europe.

0:10:50.400,0:10:53.240
I agreed with them and told them that I would gather money.

0:10:53.240,0:11:03.320
As a driver, I would follow my friends to Lagos, Abuja or Port Harcourt, any time I didn't have work.

0:11:03.320,0:11:05.840
From there, I gathered a little money.

0:11:05.840,0:11:10.840
One day, I told my wife that I wanted to travel to Libya

0:11:10.840,0:11:14.360
and she said that I should manage with little work I had.

0:11:14.360,0:11:20.560
When the day came, I woke up and she was wearing a baby belt holding our baby.

0:11:20.560,0:11:23.920
I left the house with my passport and everything I needed.

0:11:23.920,0:11:28.600
I paid 200,000 Naira to the trafficker who said he would take me to Libya.

0:11:28.600,0:11:38.140
That day, I ran away to his house and on the third day, we left for Libya.

0:11:38.140,0:11:46.100
When we got to Agadez, they put us inside 24 vehicles.

0:11:46.100,0:11:54.820
They arranged us into 24 cars.
There were 34 people in each vehicle.

0:11:54.820,0:11:58.460
We left for Sahara desert.

0:11:58.460,0:12:02.940
After two days, close to Duruku, one of the cars had an accident.

0:12:02.940,0:12:09.840
We came down to help them and buried four people who died.

0:12:09.840,0:12:11.600
The car was going fast.

0:12:11.600,0:12:18.340
Our driver said that we would not bury them because he was in hurry.

0:12:18.340,0:12:20.940
Where actually was your destination?

0:12:20.940,0:12:24.220
My destination was Europe.

0:12:24.220,0:12:29.720
When I arrived in Saba, I called my wife that I was already in Libya.

0:12:29.720,0:12:35.520
I asked her to help me to send money for my account so that I could use it to cross the border.

0:12:35.520,0:12:41.680
But, she refused because she just gave birth to my baby so she needed to take care of him.

0:12:41.680,0:12:45.500
I said that there was no problem because I would be working.

0:12:45.500,0:12:50.620
I saved 1,500 Dinars and they took me to the seaside.

0:12:50.620,0:12:54.660
When we got to the seaside, they put us in lapalapa (balloon boat).

0:12:54.660,0:12:56.600
The same night, they pushed us.

0:12:56.600,0:13:01.980
From Tunis to Malta then to International sea where there was a boundary.

0:13:01.980,0:13:11.160
Getting to international sea, we saw a very big ship surrounded by almost 25 balloon boats.

0:13:11.160,0:13:16.440
Before we knew it, we saw foreign ladies coming and they told us that

0:13:16.440,0:13:18.780
they were international rescuers and they came to rescue us.

0:13:18.780,0:13:22.040
They welcomed and addressed us that we should wait

0:13:22.040,0:13:26.440
then they would come back in 20 minutes to rescue us.

0:13:26.440,0:13:30.600
There were also other boats to the ship and they couldn't attend to all of us

0:13:30.600,0:13:33.160
so we should wait and we were waiting for them.

0:13:33.160,0:13:41.620
Within a short time, the Libyan terrorists called 'Asma boys' drove speed boats to the big ship.

0:13:41.620,0:13:49.100
They started entering balloon boats; one of them entered my boat and others to other boats.

0:13:49.100,0:13:53.780
They drove our balloon boats away and said they were taking us back to Libya.

0:13:53.780,0:13:58.100
As they drove our boats, everybody was shouting for help.

0:13:58.100,0:14:02.640
The three ladies came and begged them to leave us because we were already on international sea.

0:14:02.640,0:14:07.580
They refused and started using guns to hit people inside the boats.

0:14:07.580,0:14:11.920
They drove us to Janzur and Tripoli.

0:14:11.920,0:14:21.560
As we were going, the Asma boys poured the fuel we kept for our journey inside the boat.

0:14:21.560,0:14:23.020
There was already water in the balloon boat.

0:14:23.020,0:14:25.140
They poured the fuel inside the balloon boat.

0:14:25.140,0:14:29.680
The sea water is with salt - you cannot mix this water with fuel.

0:14:29.680,0:14:36.680
After they poured the fuel inside the boat, they told us to lie down and we did.

0:14:36.680,0:14:44.140
Then the fuel started burning us; if you see my leg, you can see the scar.

0:14:44.140,0:14:51.580
The second time, after I was freed from them, the man who was holding the camp came

0:14:51.580,0:14:55.080
and said that the second chance had come and they wanted to try to push us again.

0:14:55.080,0:14:58.080
We said as long as we decided to go to Europe, there was no problem.

0:14:58.080,0:15:03.560
At night, we took out the balloon boats that we kept in the camp

0:15:03.560,0:15:06.000
and they took us to the seaside; we were 160 people.

0:15:06.000,0:15:09.520
They took us to the seaside and pumped and fixed the boats.

0:15:09.520,0:15:18.720
When we drove about five hours on the Mediterranean sea, we saw a fisherman

0:15:18.720,0:15:24.460
and he said we should go back because the wave would become stronger within an hour

0:15:24.460,0:15:26.780
and we still had to travel more than three hours.

0:15:26.780,0:15:34.860
We told our captain to turn the boat but he said we couldn’t lose the second chance.

0:15:34.860,0:15:41.680
As we continued, people were shouting; because the fisherman warned us to go back,

0:15:41.680,0:15:48.140
they were shouting and started leaving the boat so, we told the captain to turn the boat.

0:15:48.140,0:15:55.220
Before we realised, the weather changed and started rocking the boats.

0:15:55.220,0:15:58.780
A lot of people died; we were 160 in number.

0:15:58.780,0:16:01.120
I can remember that it was about 20 people survived.

0:16:01.120,0:16:06.020
Two girls from my village died.

0:16:06.020,0:16:09.020
Almost 100 people had died during that journey.

0:16:09.020,0:16:14.640
I was praying to God to take me to Heaven and let me see my baby.

0:16:14.640,0:16:24.000
Suddenly, a bird came dipped into the water, sprinkling the water around.

0:16:24.000,0:16:30.100
As the sea became calm, 10 minutes later, we saw a big ship coming from Libya.

0:16:30.100,0:16:33.460
They came to rescue us and asked whether we were still going to Italy.

0:16:33.460,0:16:39.380
We said we're going back to prison and they took us to deportation camp in Subratha to Gharyan.

0:16:39.380,0:16:45.140
When we got to Gharyan, we saw many people – Nigerians, Gambians.

0:16:45.140,0:16:53.840
In the deportation camp in Gharyan, people from IOM used to come to check if we were doing fine.

0:16:53.840,0:17:01.680
We would say that we were fine because if we didn't, when the IOM left, they would beat us.

0:17:01.680,0:17:06.860
After this experience, every time IOM came to ask us, we always had to say we were fine.

0:17:06.860,0:17:09.780
They then transferred us from Gharyan to Tajoura.

0:17:09.780,0:17:16.120
As we got to Tajoura, they told us that a Nigerian ambassador has come to register us

0:17:16.120,0:17:19.440
and give us tickets to flight to Nigeria.

0:17:19.440,0:17:25.920
We spent three months before IOM came and shared T-shirts and gave us necessaries.

0:17:25.920,0:17:29.760
We were finally deported to Nigeria and that was this week.

0:17:29.760,0:17:34.640
When we came back, they said we should go back to our states but I said that I didn't want to

0:17:34.640,0:17:38.380
but I wanted to go to The SCOAN and meet the man of God, T.B. Joshua who I had heard about.

0:17:38.380,0:17:44.640
I came to The SCOAN with my friends and as we came, they gave us food and water

0:17:44.640,0:17:47.940
and they gave us 1.2 million Naira to share with my friends.

0:17:47.940,0:17:57.980
On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners - they want to support you, deportees.

0:17:57.980,0:18:04.560
They want to support you with a sum of 1.2 million Naira.

0:18:04.560,0:18:50.220
Deportees Receive 1.2 Million Naira
From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners

0:18:50.220,0:18:59.040
Everybody in this country, Nigeria, please note that it is not safe to travel by land.

0:18:59.040,0:19:01.220
Just wait for God's time and it would be the best.

0:19:01.220,0:19:07.460
If you are a tailor or whatever profession you are, just be satisfied with what you have.

0:19:07.460,0:19:10.460
Ask God to help you.

0:19:10.460,0:19:11.600
Thank you.

0:19:11.600,0:19:18.520
I want to advise young people to try to be yourself and wait for God's time because God's time is the best.

0:19:18.520,0:19:20.860
If I knew, I wouldn't have joined the journey.

0:19:20.860,0:19:23.520
I also learnt my lesson.

0:19:23.520,0:19:27.760
We have heard from the brothers, who have been able to share with us their experiences

0:19:27.760,0:19:32.080
from their journey to Libya.

0:19:32.080,0:19:34.460
They are not the first set of deportees.

0:19:34.460,0:19:43.200
For months, we have been receiving thousands and thousands of deportees from Libya.

0:19:43.200,0:19:57.520
As they said, after their landing here they made the decision to come to The SCOAN, having heard of

0:19:57.520,0:20:02.500
the goodness of the God Almighty through His anointed, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners

0:20:02.500,0:20:06.060
in the lives of other deportees.

0:20:06.060,0:20:11.220
They said that was why they also made this decision to come down to The SCOAN.

0:20:11.220,0:20:13.920
They are here today sharing their experience.

0:20:13.920,0:20:31.220
When they and thousands of other deportees came to The SCOAN, they were welcomed and given money.

0:20:31.220,0:20:42.500
They have come here to share the experience to the world and give advice that

0:20:42.500,0:20:48.140
if you want embark on any journey abroad, it must be taken legally.

0:20:48.140,0:20:49.720
We have heard their experience.

0:20:49.720,0:20:56.620
They have made their heart desires known to Prophet of God - T.B. Joshua.

0:20:56.620,0:21:03.100
They are here today to receive help from man of God -T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,

0:21:03.100,0:21:10.720
so that they can be useful to the society and avoid falling into bad companion.

0:21:10.720,0:21:15.280
They have shared their experiences during the Sunday service.

0:21:15.280,0:21:19.140
The man of God has made us understand that we are called to respond to all humans in need -

0:21:19.140,0:21:21.240
that is what love entails.

0:21:21.240,0:21:25.640
We cannot look the other way when our brothers and sisters are in need.

0:21:25.640,0:21:32.220
Jesus Christ has given us that commission to respond to needs of others.

0:21:32.220,0:21:38.980
That is exactly what the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners do.

0:21:38.980,0:21:50.260
In addition to the money already given, the man of God wants to give each of these two brothers

0:21:50.260,0:21:54.060
the sum of 200.000 Naira.

0:21:54.060,0:21:58.960
The purpose of this is to establish them out there.

0:21:58.960,0:22:06.060
They have spent their all savings to go Libya, where they were able to gain nothing -

0:22:06.060,0:22:08.620
they have come back empty-handed.

0:22:08.620,0:22:17.260
In order to prevent them from entering the bad companion in the world Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:22:17.260,0:22:30.380
and Emmanuel TV partners help them financially, apart from the money given them initially.

0:22:30.380,0:22:35.740
They also received a book titled "the Mirror" - a faith building book.

0:22:35.740,0:22:41.800
As you read it your faith will be lifted up - you will see a need to follow Jesus Christ along the way.

0:22:41.800,0:22:46.560
We give glory to God Almighty for what He has used the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in the lives

0:22:46.560,0:22:52.680
of these two brothers and other people who had been deported from Libya.

0:22:52.680,0:22:58.560
I want to say thank you to Prophet T.B. Joshua for helping me with the sum of 200.000 Naira.

0:22:58.560,0:23:01.340
With this, I will be able to start something.

0:23:01.340,0:23:08.880
I interviewed with several media who targeted us from other countries but nothing returned.

0:23:08.880,0:23:11.520
But with this...

0:23:11.520,0:23:15.560
