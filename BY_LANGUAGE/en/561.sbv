0:00:00.060,0:00:03.840
My name is Philomina Sunday. I am a widow.

0:00:03.840,0:00:06.540
I am a mother of nine children.

0:00:06.540,0:00:13.400
I have been suffering, begging for food to eat. Nobody will assist me.

0:00:13.400,0:00:18.500
I started going to dustbins to pick food to eat.

0:00:18.500,0:00:24.700
Even the clothes that I am wearing, I picked them from the dustbin, washed them to wear.

0:00:24.700,0:00:31.680
Even for my children, I will pick clothes from the dustbin and wash them for them to wear.

0:00:31.680,0:00:40.800
If we don't go to the dustbin early, we will not find food to eat.

0:00:40.800,0:00:47.460
When we go there early, we will find food to pick there.

0:00:47.460,0:00:56.800
Sometimes when we go there, we will find some foods like yam, corn, bread and groundnut.

0:00:56.800,0:00:59.480
We will pick all of those things there.

0:00:59.480,0:01:02.720
Things have been very difficult for me.

0:01:02.720,0:01:05.740
There was a woman who saw me at the dustbin.

0:01:05.740,0:01:10.080
She asked what I was doing at the dustbin with these children, picking food every day.

0:01:10.080,0:01:13.940
I said there was nobody to help me.

0:01:13.940,0:01:19.260
I have been suffering. If I go to people to give me money, they will disappoint me.

0:01:19.260,0:01:28.040
My boyfriend - I was thinking that he was going to help me and my children,

0:01:28.040,0:01:35.120
to send them to school. But the man disappointed me. He could not do it.

0:01:35.120,0:01:37.880
I told the woman that this is where I get food to eat.

0:01:37.880,0:01:42.440
She then asked me if I knew about The SCOAN. I said, "No".

0:01:42.440,0:01:44.500
She said she would help me.

0:01:44.500,0:01:47.440
I asked her how was she going to help me get to The SCOAN

0:01:47.440,0:01:50.580
because I didn't know anybody there.

0:01:50.580,0:01:52.960
The woman told me that I should not worry.

0:01:52.960,0:01:55.760
There was a day we went to a dustbin.

0:01:55.760,0:02:00.820
We were collecting food and cans.

0:02:00.820,0:02:06.280
We would sell the cans for 50 naira and use the money to buy food to eat.

0:02:06.280,0:02:11.740
The woman then came to me and told me that we should prepare now.

0:02:11.740,0:02:15.740
The woman chartered a bus and put us on it.

0:02:15.740,0:02:21.280
She said that if I wanted the man of God to really believe that I am suffering,

0:02:21.280,0:02:26.360
I should give the man of God this cassette and he should watch it

0:02:26.360,0:02:28.360
to see how I am suffering.

0:02:28.360,0:02:33.460
The woman gave me the cassette that I should take it to The SCOAN,

0:02:33.460,0:02:35.520
that the man of God would help me.

0:02:35.520,0:02:37.860
Let us watch the video.

0:06:46.240,0:06:48.280
Is that where you live??

0:06:48.280,0:06:49.380
Yes, sir.

0:06:49.380,0:06:50.560
This is where you sleep?

0:06:50.560,0:06:51.680
Yes.

0:06:51.680,0:07:02.420
No matter your level in life, you are a solution to a problem.

0:07:05.720,0:07:08.200
Where is your husband??

0:07:08.200,0:07:11.940
He died in 2004, on the 18th of August.

0:07:11.940,0:07:14.300
Where is the senior one?

0:07:14.300,0:07:17.060
The senior daughter is here.

0:07:17.060,0:07:19.960
She has married?

0:07:19.960,0:07:21.000
Yes.

0:07:22.440,0:07:27.700
My Name is Abumare Faith.

0:07:27.700,0:07:31.360
What my mother is saying is true.

0:07:31.360,0:07:36.740
Because of the suffering, I saw a man that said he was going to keep me in his house.

0:07:36.740,0:07:42.940
I didn't know the man was suffering. I have two children from him.

0:07:42.940,0:07:46.580
He doesn't have any work.

0:07:46.580,0:07:51.360
The clothes I am wearing are from the dustbin.

0:07:51.360,0:07:57.200
My mum came one day and told us that she had something to tell us.

0:07:57.200,0:08:03.820
She said that a woman told her to go to The SCOAN.

0:08:03.820,0:08:08.300
I know that as we have come here, our story will turn around.

0:08:08.300,0:08:13.780
Whatever we want to do to restore this family, let them be part of our family.

0:08:13.780,0:08:17.420
We will counsel them so that these children will not be destroyed.

0:08:17.420,0:08:21.800
She has no reason for getting married but because of problems.

0:08:21.800,0:08:23.920
That is what she is saying

0:08:23.920,0:08:29.980
They have to get accommodation. These children have to go to school.

0:08:29.980,0:08:32.520
They will go for deliverance now.

0:08:32.520,0:08:34.320
That poverty is not just poverty

0:08:34.320,0:08:42.080
but it has become a curse and Jesus can remove this curse.

0:08:42.080,0:08:51.760
All over the world. People like this - they are everywhere.

0:08:51.760,0:08:57.260
Please find them, help them and restore them.

0:08:57.260,0:08:59.940
Don't just pass by and close your eyes.

0:08:59.940,0:09:02.880
What can we do? Let us put an end to this.

0:09:02.880,0:09:08.700
First, we want to give her 500,000 naira.

0:09:15.940,0:09:20.640
They can give them 10 bags of rice.

0:09:26.080,0:09:30.220
They will stay in the church until we get them a house.

0:09:33.320,0:09:35.900
My Name is Anthonia.

0:09:35.900,0:09:39.760
I thank the man of God for what he has done for us.

0:09:39.760,0:09:46.700
Since my mother has been suffering, I saw a man that said he liked me.

0:09:46.700,0:09:49.140
He made me pregnant.

0:09:49.140,0:09:57.480
After I gave birth to my baby, I found out that the man at times has a mental problem.

0:09:57.480,0:10:02.800
This June, the mental problem started.

0:10:02.800,0:10:06.940
Sometimes he will start behaving strangely outside.

0:10:06.940,0:10:08.740
People will start running away.

0:10:08.740,0:10:13.380
He used to beat me and my baby. Sometimes he will kick us out.

0:10:13.380,0:10:16.100
My mother doesn't have anything.

0:10:16.100,0:10:20.180
If I go to her, she doesn't have anything to give me.

0:10:20.180,0:10:23.820
She doesn't have any place to keep me and my baby.

0:10:23.820,0:10:27.060
Man of God, please help me.

0:10:31.460,0:10:34.440
That marriage should be immediately terminated.

0:10:34.440,0:10:40.840
It is a wrong marriage, caused by poverty. Your future first before marriage.

0:10:40.840,0:10:43.700
Let them face their career and future.

0:10:43.700,0:10:46.540
If the Lord says they will marry tomorrow, they can marry tomorrow.

0:10:46.540,0:10:50.280
But that marriage should be stopped for now.

0:10:57.360,0:11:00.460
What a beautiful baby girl! Look at this one.

0:11:00.460,0:11:03.300
What is your name?

0:11:03.300,0:11:04.580
Esther.

0:11:04.580,0:11:06.340
Wow - look!

0:11:06.340,0:11:08.720
Watch your screen.

0:11:12.760,0:11:14.580
Look at the face!

0:11:15.880,0:11:18.740
Man of God, I have something to tell you.

0:11:18.740,0:11:24.460
I am thanking you for removing me from poverty to riches today.

0:11:24.460,0:11:28.760
I am thanking you for all the good things you have done for me.

0:11:28.760,0:11:33.400
You will live long!

0:11:39.060,0:11:45.340
The opposite is the case now. I am to thank you for receiving this gift.

0:11:45.340,0:11:47.900
Thank you for receiving this gift.

0:11:47.900,0:11:52.020
You will live long!

0:11:56.000,0:11:56.980
Thank you.

0:12:01.580,0:12:08.080
TESTIMONY TIME

0:12:08.840,0:12:12.340
My name is Philomina Sunday. I am a widow.

0:12:12.340,0:12:15.500
I am 42 years old.

0:12:15.500,0:12:18.600
I am from Kogi State (Nigeria).

0:12:18.600,0:12:22.400
These are my children and grandchildren.

0:12:22.400,0:12:25.680
My husband died 5 years ago.

0:12:25.680,0:12:28.960
Since then things have been difficult for me.

0:12:28.960,0:12:39.820
I have been suffering, begging for food, going to dustbins to pick food to eat with my children.

0:12:39.820,0:12:43.020
I thank God today that my case is over.

0:12:43.020,0:12:47.020
My husband was a very big man.

0:12:47.020,0:12:51.260
When I complained to him that I wanted to start a business,

0:12:51.260,0:12:54.620
he asked me what type of business I wanted to start.

0:12:54.620,0:12:58.860
I told him that I wanted to sell cows.

0:12:58.860,0:13:03.500
He gave me the money to start the business.

0:13:03.500,0:13:07.640
We were living fine and rich.

0:13:07.640,0:13:13.160
When my husband had an accident and broke his ribs,

0:13:13.160,0:13:25.040
I was taking him to different hospitals, spending money.

0:13:25.040,0:13:28.880
He then told me that the money is finished.

0:13:28.880,0:13:31.840
He said he was going back to his villiage.

0:13:31.840,0:13:34.520
We prepared to go to his village.

0:13:34.520,0:13:38.200
He sent me to bring a document,

0:13:38.200,0:13:46.680
telling me that I should not return on Monday but on Friday.

0:13:46.680,0:13:49.900
I asked him why he asked me to return on Friday.

0:13:49.900,0:13:55.020
He said it was so that he could prepare our property in the house.

0:13:55.020,0:13:56.820
I said okay.

0:13:56.820,0:14:01.760
I then went to Asaba.

0:14:01.760,0:14:07.260
On Thursday, I called Anthonia's phone number; it wasn't going through.

0:14:07.260,0:14:10.340
I was calling her daddy's number but it also not going through.

0:14:10.340,0:14:15.240
So, I had to call my husband's cousin.

0:14:15.240,0:14:20.920
That was on Friday morning. I was feeling cold all over me.

0:14:20.920,0:14:23.120
I could not get myself.

0:14:23.120,0:14:30.300
He then told me that my husband had died.

0:14:30.300,0:14:32.340
I asked what had killed him.

0:14:32.340,0:14:34.640
He said double cross my heart and to start coming,

0:14:34.640,0:14:37.920
not to call any of my family to come. I said no;

0:14:37.920,0:14:45.880
I had to go and call my parents and my uncle. They followed me to that place.

0:14:45.880,0:14:52.220
My Husband died on August 18th, that was on Thursday at 6 o'clock.

0:14:52.220,0:14:55.680
They buried him at 12 o'clock, midnight.

0:14:55.680,0:15:05.460
They didn't allow me to see the corpse. There were a lot of complaints.

0:15:05.460,0:15:09.200
I said, "God, let Your will be done".

0:15:09.200,0:15:16.540
When my husband died, there was no money with us.

0:15:16.540,0:15:29.460
Since then I have been going to the dustbin to pick food, cans and clothes.

0:15:29.460,0:15:34.440
I sold the cans to get money.

0:15:34.440,0:15:38.980
To eat once in a day was difficult.

0:15:38.980,0:15:46.760
That is why my daughters fell into that situation, to meet a man to help.

0:15:46.760,0:15:53.440
They got married and had children.

0:15:53.440,0:16:04.400
This is my first daughter and she has three children because of our poverty.

0:16:04.400,0:16:12.880
My second daughter Anthonia has a baby girl from a man.

0:16:12.880,0:16:16.660
The husband has a mental problem.

0:16:16.660,0:16:20.500
The other children are not going to school anymore.

0:16:20.500,0:16:24.460
My name is Anthonia Sunday. This is my baby.

0:16:24.460,0:16:27.240
I thank God for what He has done in our lives,

0:16:27.240,0:16:34.800
for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to bless my family with 500,000 naira and 10 bags of rice.

0:16:34.800,0:16:36.460
We are very happy.

0:16:36.460,0:16:40.560
Now we no longer need to pick food from the dustbin but eat at the dining table.

0:16:40.560,0:16:44.820
God should continue to bless Prophet T.B. Joshua for all that he has done for us.

0:16:44.820,0:16:52.440
After giving Mrs Philomena Sunday and her family the sum of 500,000 naira and 10 bags of rice,

0:16:52.440,0:16:58.540
Prophet T.B. Joshua sent the Emmanuel TV team to look for and rent an accommodation

0:16:58.540,0:17:05.440
that would be suitable for them as they prepare to open a new chapter in their lives.

0:17:05.440,0:17:10.200
This is the accommodation they finally chose.

0:17:22.460,0:17:28.220
One by one the Emmanuel TV team enter, carrying different pieces of furniture

0:17:28.220,0:17:35.000
that would transform this new appartment into a comfortable home for the family.

0:17:35.000,0:17:39.800
New furniture, appliances and upholstery are being brought in,

0:17:39.800,0:17:45.260
soon to be arranged so that the family can move in.

0:17:45.260,0:17:49.720
In comes the new mattress and the frame for the bed.

0:18:00.200,0:18:06.460
As a finishing touch, the Emmanuel TV team and Partners purchased two comfortable chairs

0:18:06.460,0:18:09.940
and a coffee table to adorn the sitting room.

0:18:09.940,0:18:12.340
What an amazing contrast!

0:18:12.340,0:18:17.940
A family who was once suffering, living on the streets and eating from dustbins

0:18:17.940,0:18:24.260
is now about to move into a safe, clean, pleasant and comfortable environment.

0:18:24.260,0:18:26.280
What a transformation!

0:18:26.280,0:18:36.140
Glory be to God!

0:18:36.140,0:18:42.100
