0:00:00.000,0:00:02.000
Thank You, Lord.

0:00:02.000,0:00:05.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:05.220,0:00:10.480
Glory be to God.

0:00:10.480,0:00:14.980
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:00:14.980,0:00:20.660
Viewers, we salute your faith.

0:00:20.660,0:00:25.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:25.320,0:00:30.100
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:30.100,0:00:35.300
I know today, the Spirit of God will talk to you.

0:00:35.300,0:00:37.320
Hallelujah!

0:00:37.320,0:00:42.100
Let's quickly take our Bible to the Book of John.

0:00:42.100,0:00:48.920
John 14; I will take my proof text from John 14, the rest of the Book will be given to you.

0:00:48.920,0:00:56.880
“ ‘Do not let your heart be troubled…”

0:00:56.880,0:01:01.940
I told you about the word ‘heart’, it is your spirit they refer to.

0:01:01.940,0:01:07.260
Wherever you see the word ‘heart’, it means your spirit, biblically.

0:01:07.260,0:01:11.660
It refers to your spirit – man’s spirit.

0:01:11.660,0:01:16.960
“ ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God…"

0:01:16.960,0:01:21.020
Without heart, you cannot have anything to do with God – without spirit.

0:01:21.020,0:01:24.260
He uses our spirit to get to us.

0:01:24.260,0:01:28.380
The spirit of God uses our spirit to talk to us.

0:01:28.380,0:01:30.540
This is why you see 'heart'.

0:01:30.540,0:01:40.040
“ ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.

0:01:40.040,0:01:47.160
My Father’s house has many mansions;

0:01:47.160,0:01:55.160
if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?' "

0:01:55.160,0:01:58.860
It means there are so many mansions, big mansions,

0:01:58.860,0:02:03.960
that is why He is going there to prepare a place for you; there will be an accommodation for you.

0:02:03.960,0:02:08.540
Let's go to the verse 26, which is the proof text.

0:02:08.540,0:02:20.500
“But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,

0:02:20.500,0:02:29.060
will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.”

0:02:29.060,0:02:31.220
That is the Holy Spirit.

0:02:31.220,0:02:45.620
Go back to that Book of John 14, Acts 16:7 and Luke 24:47.

0:02:45.620,0:02:47.360
That would be very good.

0:02:47.360,0:02:51.960
Also the Book of Ephesians 4:30.

0:02:51.960,0:02:58.780
In that John 14:26: "But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,

0:02:58.780,0:03:05.480
will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.”

0:03:05.480,0:03:15.940
It means without that Holy Spirit, you cannot remember anything of Jesus.

0:03:15.940,0:03:21.560
This means, if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.

0:03:21.560,0:03:25.360
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true believer.

0:03:25.360,0:03:29.300
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.

0:03:29.300,0:03:36.560
That is why there is a fashion today - they call religion one, they call Christianity the other.

0:03:36.560,0:03:45.060
You just choose where you want to belong - to religious people, or to Christianity.

0:03:45.060,0:03:48.820
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:03:48.820,0:03:52.880
Our heart is the contact point; it is the communication point.

0:03:52.880,0:03:57.120
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:03:57.120,0:04:00.060
That is Christianity for you.

0:04:00.060,0:04:08.480
He came to restore the relationship and fellowship between you and God.

0:04:08.480,0:04:11.760
Religious people believe they must go there

0:04:11.760,0:04:18.380
but our God came to restore the relationship and fellowship between you and God.

0:04:18.380,0:04:23.920
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.

0:04:23.920,0:04:29.460
You are not born again, you are not a Christian, you are not a true believer.

0:04:29.460,0:04:32.680
How can you be born of the Spirit

0:04:32.680,0:04:40.580
because our God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.

0:04:40.580,0:04:43.060
That is why you have to be born of the Spirit.

0:04:43.060,0:04:50.900
Going by that Book of John 14:26,

0:04:50.900,0:04:54.060
and the Book of Ephesians 4:30,

0:04:54.060,0:04:58.140
you will find those key messages, and in Acts 16:6-7.

0:04:58.140,0:05:02.920
The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person.

0:05:02.920,0:05:04.380
Take note of that.

0:05:04.380,0:05:08.460
If the Holy Spirit is a Divine Person, who is standing here?

0:05:08.460,0:05:12.800
Is it T.B. Joshua that is talking to you, or the Divine Person?

0:05:12.800,0:05:19.880
In you - Divine Person, if you are a Christian, believer, born-again.

0:05:19.880,0:05:28.380
I'm here, T.B. Joshua and the Divine Person is standing before you, but you don't know who is talking to you.

0:05:28.380,0:05:32.980
What happens will determine.

0:05:32.980,0:05:38.200
When the Divine Person talks, changes are beginning.

0:05:38.200,0:05:42.480
It means I'm here, but the appearance you are seeing is Mr. T.B. Joshua.

0:05:42.480,0:05:50.240
We have two natures in one person – the divine and human.

0:05:50.240,0:05:53.020
The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person.

0:05:53.020,0:06:06.260
This Divine Person we obtain as a gift from God upon repentance and baptism.

0:06:06.260,0:06:10.280
If you have not repented, you cannot receive that Divine Person.

0:06:10.280,0:06:15.500
You will stand to be preaching, not the Divine Person.

0:06:15.500,0:06:26.060
You have the ability to preach; Divine Person, the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.

0:06:26.060,0:06:34.980
You have the ability, charismatic, you can talk but the Holy Spirit also talks as He wills.

0:06:34.980,0:06:42.840
When the Holy Spirit talks, changes are beginning.

0:06:42.840,0:06:49.160
This Divine Person we obtain, we receive as a gift from God, freely from God,

0:06:49.160,0:06:54.280
upon repentance and baptism.

0:06:54.280,0:06:56.260
What is repentance?

0:06:56.260,0:06:57.380
That is the question.

0:06:57.380,0:07:06.840
Repentance means, being deeply sorry for sin.

0:07:06.840,0:07:19.700
I mean, being committed to a new way of life, from unfaithfulness to faithfulness;

0:07:19.700,0:07:31.880
being committed to a new way of life – from disobedience to obedience, from hate to love,

0:07:31.880,0:07:35.380
from unrighteousness to righteousness.

0:07:35.380,0:07:45.320
Being committed to a new way of life, that of serving God, following God

0:07:45.320,0:07:53.140
which comes when God’s Spirit begins to live in us.

0:07:53.140,0:08:00.920
You cannot do it; no one can do the work of the Cross, only God can.

0:08:00.920,0:08:03.460
You say, "I want to be obedient".

0:08:03.460,0:08:05.180
You want to be obedient?

0:08:05.180,0:08:12.380
You can be obedient to yourself but to be obedient to God, you need the Spirit of God.

0:08:12.380,0:08:19.140
This obedience comes when God’s Spirit begins to live in us.

0:08:19.140,0:08:27.180
The more you meditate, the more your heart acts upon the Word of God.

0:08:27.180,0:08:34.500
You can preach, I can preach but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.

0:08:34.500,0:08:41.020
When the Holy Spirit preaches, changes are beginning.

0:08:41.020,0:08:47.720
The words we speak in prayer, in counselling,

0:08:47.720,0:08:51.780
if they are not according to the true Word of God,

0:08:51.780,0:08:55.460
I mean if they are not according to the Spirit of God,

0:08:55.460,0:09:03.800
they will be idle, meaningless and often times destructive.

0:09:03.800,0:09:11.920
Because when you call the name 'Jesus', and you are not calling this name by the help of the Holy Ghost;

0:09:11.920,0:09:15.800
when satan hears it - that name is like an eagle.

0:09:15.800,0:09:25.500
When there is an eagle flying, moving around, you see some chicken moving around;

0:09:25.500,0:09:29.740
you see the chicken running for shelter.

0:09:29.740,0:09:34.100
Just the same name 'Jesus' - satan does not even want to hear that named called -

0:09:34.100,0:09:42.160
whether that name is called with the help of the Holy Ghost but mere hearing that name 'Jesus!'...

0:09:42.160,0:09:49.480
If they now realise that you are calling that name by yourself, not by the help of the Holy Ghost -

0:09:49.480,0:09:52.840
they get you arrested, beating you.

0:09:52.840,0:09:56.000
This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.

0:09:56.000,0:10:02.760
It is like you see a tiger, or lion and you don't know whether it is tied down.

0:10:02.760,0:10:07.480
Mere seeing lion - my brother, what will you do?

0:10:07.480,0:10:13.980
You don't want to know whether it is tied down or not - you run for your dear life.

0:10:13.980,0:10:17.720
Before you know the lion was tied down, you have disappeared.

0:10:17.720,0:10:25.960
In the same way the name 'Jesus' - when satan hears 'Jesus', "Who is calling the name 'Jesus'?"

0:10:25.960,0:10:30.760
By the time they sight you and they realise that the name you are calling

0:10:30.760,0:10:36.640
is not by the help of the Holy Ghost, you will pay dearly for it.

0:10:36.640,0:10:39.720
This is exactly what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.

0:10:39.720,0:10:48.600
The words we speak in prayer - "In Jesus' name!", "Be healed!" - in counselling, in teaching,

0:10:48.600,0:10:57.540
if they are not according to the true Word of God, if they are not according to the Spirit of God,

0:10:57.540,0:11:03.940
they will be idle and oftentimes destructive – very dangerous.

0:11:03.940,0:11:16.780
The Bible says in Luke 24:47, ‘Repentance allows us to receive a new life from God’.

0:11:16.780,0:11:22.700
Repentance allows us to receive what?

0:11:22.700,0:11:23.520
Talk to me!

0:11:23.520,0:11:24.760
[- A new life.]

0:11:24.760,0:11:26.820
What allows you to receive a new life?

0:11:26.820,0:11:27.860
[-Repentance.]

0:11:27.860,0:11:29.640
Repentance.

0:11:29.640,0:11:35.200
What is that new life?

0:11:35.200,0:12:01.080
Repentance is our only hope of receiving God’s mercy.

0:12:01.080,0:12:18.620
We have the Holy Spirit because God’s Word plainly so indicates,

0:12:18.620,0:12:27.300
not because of some emotional sensation.

0:12:27.300,0:12:33.600
"I have received the Holy Spirit..."

0:12:33.600,0:12:37.160
Not because of some emotional sensation.

0:12:37.160,0:12:49.940
We have the Holy Spirit because God’s Word plainly so indicates.

0:12:49.940,0:12:54.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:54.240,0:12:59.840
"It is the Holy Spirit" - what kind of Holy Spirit?

0:12:59.840,0:13:03.220
Manifestation.

0:13:03.220,0:13:19.340
Not because of some emotional sensation, but because God's Word plainly so indicates.

0:13:19.340,0:13:43.480
In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are told that man is a divine being, spirit being.

0:13:43.480,0:13:51.160
The real thing about man is not his body but his spirit.

0:13:51.160,0:13:56.820
Man is a spirit being.

0:13:56.820,0:14:00.380
The real thing about you...

0:14:00.380,0:14:01.120
Tell your neighbour;

0:14:01.120,0:14:06.420
The real thing about me is not my body.

0:14:06.420,0:14:13.160
When we wake up in the morning, you make up, do your hair, look in the mirror -

0:14:13.160,0:14:15.640
you have forgotten the real thing.

0:14:15.640,0:14:17.620
You have forgotten to dress the real thing.

0:14:17.620,0:14:20.660
You have forgotten to make up for the real thing.

0:14:20.660,0:14:25.520
You have forgotten to put more hair, wig for the real thing.

0:14:25.520,0:14:31.000
You have forgotten to make up for the real thing.

0:14:31.000,0:14:33.780
You have forgotten the real thing.

0:14:33.780,0:14:37.040
Whom are we supposed to take care of first?

0:14:37.040,0:14:43.400
The real thing - tell your neighbour - should be the first priority.

0:14:43.400,0:14:45.920
You are supposed to take care of the real thing;

0:14:45.920,0:14:51.040
bath the real thing, make up for the real thing, take care of the real thing.

0:14:51.040,0:14:59.200
The real thing about you is not your body but your spirit.

0:14:59.200,0:15:10.960
Today, what are you taking care of?

0:15:10.960,0:15:15.200
Tell me how many times you have looked in the mirror and you saw the real thing,

0:15:15.200,0:15:17.620
and you know how it looks like.

0:15:17.620,0:15:23.080
Some of us look good, beautiful, handsome, but if you look at your real thing -

0:15:23.080,0:15:28.420
this is the way you look because we are not taking care of it.

0:15:28.420,0:15:32.800
Some of your real things look like...

0:15:32.800,0:15:34.280
And you look beautiful.

0:15:34.280,0:15:38.920
Sometimes, when I see people moving around, "Hi";

0:15:38.920,0:15:45.360
when I look at him to know the real thing in him, the real thing looks like...

0:15:45.360,0:15:50.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:50.860,0:16:01.900
Tell your neighbour, “You will be very embarrassed when you see your real thing”.

0:16:01.900,0:16:04.540
Can you see the life we are living?

0:16:04.540,0:16:07.580
You would be very embarrassed, if God showed you your real thing.

0:16:07.580,0:16:14.140
Some of the real things look like this...

0:16:14.140,0:16:16.660
But you - you look beautiful, handsome.

0:16:16.660,0:16:23.720
You make up in the morning, you wake up, you take care of yourself, you do your teeth.

0:16:23.720,0:16:27.260
You say, "Can you get me salad?"

0:16:27.260,0:16:29.720
Have you fed your real thing?

0:16:29.720,0:16:34.820
"Salad, do you have salad there? No, I need salad."

0:16:34.820,0:16:37.340
And the real thing is suffering.

0:16:37.340,0:16:45.760
Tell your neighbour, “The real thing about me is not my body”.

0:16:45.760,0:16:53.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:53.220,0:17:00.380
If God revealed to you your real thing, your real self, your real value, the way it looks like,

0:17:00.380,0:17:08.660
you would quarrel, "Why am I looking so handsome; look at it. Look at my real value and the way it looks."

0:17:08.660,0:17:15.100
In John 8, the Bible says, ‘When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed’,

0:17:15.100,0:17:23.120
He meant the liberation of your spirit, not your body.

0:17:23.120,0:17:31.880
He meant the liberation of your spirit – man’s spirit.

0:17:31.880,0:17:35.160
This is what He meant.

0:17:35.160,0:17:37.960
It is a shame.

0:17:37.960,0:17:42.940
We live life in descending order instead of ascending order.

0:17:42.940,0:17:53.980
Everything about us like that.

0:17:53.980,0:17:58.440
You want to do this, that...

0:17:58.440,0:18:06.840
You keep doing things by yourself, not by the help of the real thing – your real self, your real value.

0:18:06.840,0:18:10.660
You keep doing many things.

0:18:10.660,0:18:23.220
You wake up; instead of consulting your real self whom the Holy Spirit works through, you abandon that.

0:18:23.220,0:18:27.440
When the Bible says, ‘When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed’,

0:18:27.440,0:18:33.900
it means the liberation of your spirit – man’s spirit.

0:18:33.900,0:18:43.160
I’m telling you here - look at me, two personalities here today, but you don't know.

0:18:43.160,0:18:54.760
Look here - two personalities; the one that put on the suit - good, that is Mr. T.B. Joshua,

0:18:54.760,0:18:59.700
there is also one - my real self.

0:18:59.700,0:19:05.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:05.420,0:19:14.460
You cannot get involved in God’s project without your real self.

0:19:14.460,0:19:17.360
Man is a spirit being.

0:19:17.360,0:19:19.280
You are a spirit being.

0:19:19.280,0:19:20.360
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:20.360,0:19:25.360
[You are a spirit being.]

0:19:25.360,0:19:29.460

0:19:29.460,0:19:33.620
"In the name of Jesus - be healed, be delivered!"

0:19:33.620,0:19:37.900
They take time, "Who is talking there? Is it T.B. Joshua that is talking?"

0:19:37.900,0:19:41.120
If it is T.B. Joshua, he is talking to himself.

0:19:41.120,0:19:47.460
Only you will hear him, and he will hear himself - but God...

0:19:47.460,0:19:53.860
He is making noise, he is talking to air.

0:19:53.860,0:19:57.560
See the whole world today - can you see? We are lost.

0:19:57.560,0:20:01.540
When it comes to things of the Spirit, we are lost.

0:20:01.540,0:20:04.940
You don't even know whether you worship God.

0:20:04.940,0:20:10.420
Because man cannot do the work of the Cross, only God can.

0:20:10.420,0:20:18.180
When we try to do the work of the Cross by ourselves, we are inflicting pain on ourselves.

0:20:18.180,0:20:19.320
What is the pain?

0:20:19.320,0:20:29.860
Our word is meaningless, oftentimes destructive, idle - it is pain.

0:20:29.860,0:20:33.700
"I'm here today to say 'Praise the Lord. Hallelujah!'",

0:20:33.700,0:20:39.220
and I'm not sent, inspired, not by the help of Holy Spirit, and I carry the Bible and say,

0:20:39.220,0:20:41.760
"Men, hallelujah!"

0:20:41.760,0:20:47.840
You see everybody enjoying, emotional - oh my God.

0:20:47.840,0:20:51.880
I'm inflicting pain on myself.

0:20:51.880,0:20:59.620
Whatever I say that day will be meaningless, idle, oftentimes destructive.

0:20:59.620,0:21:03.320
Pain.

0:21:03.320,0:21:09.720
When I finish talking here and go back to sleep; dream, vision -

0:21:09.720,0:21:14.640
beating me, killing me, asking, "Who sent you?

0:21:14.640,0:21:23.420
What are you saying? You are talking against us. You are rebuking us. You are satan's shame.

0:21:23.420,0:21:26.260
Do you know whom you are talking to? Who sent you to say that?"

0:21:26.260,0:21:34.160
Beating you mercilessly, pain, giving you shit to eat.

0:21:34.160,0:21:40.620
When you wake up, you will not tell anyone; only you know what happened to you.

0:21:40.620,0:21:48.720
They will ride you like a bicycle, "Go to your church. Go, and preach the Word of God".

0:21:48.720,0:21:58.800
Man has the ability to preach but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.

0:21:58.800,0:22:03.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:03.780,0:22:13.040
Intimation must come to us from the Spirit, "Do it this way, do it that way".

0:22:13.040,0:22:17.560
Suggestion must come from above to tell you,

0:22:17.560,0:22:26.500
"OK, talk to this person, pray, stretch your hand, no, don't do that, go, look..."

0:22:26.500,0:22:30.680
Suggestion must come from the Spirit.

0:22:30.680,0:22:34.540
If not...

0:22:34.540,0:22:40.320
Corresponding power - if not, and you start doing things on your own...

0:22:40.320,0:22:48.500
Because you are well educated, you can read Bible, you understand Bible - Bible is not literature.

0:22:48.500,0:22:58.080
The Holy Spirit moved on men of old to document the Holy Word.

0:22:58.080,0:23:06.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:06.680,0:23:16.300
We were talking about the Book of 1 Thessalonians 5:23 -

0:23:16.300,0:23:34.600
man is a spirit being, he is a divine person possessed of spirit, soul and body.

0:23:34.600,0:23:46.820
It is possible to identify our body; what of our soul and spirit?

0:23:46.820,0:23:52.400
Shall we say we have no soul and spirit because we cannot identify them -

0:23:52.400,0:23:57.060
because there is no emotional contact to prove their existence

0:23:57.060,0:24:05.120
or there is no emotional reaction to prove their existence?

0:24:05.120,0:24:11.480
Shall we say we have no soul and spirit when God says we have?

0:24:11.480,0:24:14.940
Let me leave you with this word:

0:24:14.940,0:24:21.840
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.

0:24:21.840,0:24:23.220
Tell your neighbour.

0:24:23.220,0:24:26.560
[If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.]

0:24:26.560,0:24:29.940
No, let me put it this way; there are two Christians -

0:24:29.940,0:24:35.060
if you are not born again, born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.

0:24:35.060,0:24:36.520
Tell your neighbour.

0:24:36.520,0:24:44.020
[if you are not born again, born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.]

0:24:44.020,0:24:48.720
There must be corresponding power.

0:24:48.720,0:24:53.520
You must connect with your Father in Heaven.

0:24:53.520,0:25:08.100
A suggestion must come from above on what to do – an intimation,

0:25:08.100,0:25:14.700
if not, you will continue to live on copy.

0:25:14.700,0:25:19.020
"What did he say?"

0:25:19.020,0:25:21.940
"What do they say?"

0:25:21.940,0:25:27.800
"What is this?"

0:25:27.800,0:25:29.620
"Where should I go?"

0:25:29.620,0:25:34.920
You continue to live on copy.

0:25:34.920,0:25:41.520
When you are using a copy, and it is not original, you know how it is?

0:25:41.520,0:25:49.060
If I want to give you a book, and I make a photo-copy and give you that copy.

0:25:49.060,0:25:54.240
You continue to live a copy life.

0:25:54.240,0:26:00.440
Your business, your life, your health, your joy, your peace;

0:26:00.440,0:26:11.040
there is a copy-peace, copy-joy, copy-business, copy-happiness, copy...

0:26:11.040,0:26:24.720
Without corresponding power from above, without intimation, suggestion...

0:26:24.720,0:26:29.420
If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.

0:26:29.420,0:26:39.440
You can be the richest in the world, without the Spirit of God.

0:26:39.440,0:26:47.100
You can have the largest church, congregation all over the world, without the Spirit of God.

0:26:47.100,0:26:48.340
Listen to me.

0:26:48.340,0:26:54.160
You can have the largest church, without the Spirit of God.

0:26:54.160,0:27:03.680
The largest congregation; the crowd is not our strength.

0:27:03.680,0:27:08.420
Watch Emmanuel TV - it is the most watched channel, all over the world.

0:27:08.420,0:27:13.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:13.380,0:27:17.980
The most watched channel now - click it - all over the world.

0:27:17.980,0:27:25.580
But this is Ikotun Egbe, a very isolated city here.

0:27:25.580,0:27:28.960
But you find your way to come.

0:27:28.960,0:27:35.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:35.500,0:27:44.100
Crowd - the largest church all over the world can be operating without the Holy Spirit.

0:27:44.100,0:27:48.680
You can be the richest man of the world, without the Holy Spirit.

0:27:48.680,0:27:53.940
You can be the most famous one, all over the world, without the Holy Spirit.

0:27:53.940,0:27:57.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:57.260,0:28:09.780
Our joy, our main reward is peace of heart.

0:28:09.780,0:28:12.140
Are you with me?

0:28:12.140,0:28:15.600
How many soldiers do you see here with guns?

0:28:15.600,0:28:18.160
Do you see barricades here?

0:28:18.160,0:28:22.220
Because I have so much peace of heart.

0:28:22.220,0:28:29.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:29.100,0:28:38.740
There are supposed to be barricades here, because somebody can jump there.

0:28:38.740,0:28:42.780
Even ushers - I don't want them standing here - go your way,

0:28:42.780,0:28:46.840
because there is so much peace of heart.

0:28:46.840,0:28:52.200
If you send me over there, you are helping me - that is my home.

0:28:52.200,0:28:57.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:57.240,0:29:04.120
You are just helping me; that is my home, this is where I want to be.

0:29:04.120,0:29:11.600
Sending me there is helping, it is not anything but helping me.

0:29:11.600,0:29:16.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:16.380,0:29:20.440
What are we talking about?

0:29:20.440,0:29:32.840
All those things you see as a testimony of Holy Spirit, manifestation of Holy Spirit, this, that...

0:29:32.840,0:29:40.320
The testimony of the Holy Spirit is peace of heart.

0:29:40.320,0:29:44.860
Because you need that peace of heart, that is why you keep running.

0:29:44.860,0:29:47.680
You can't eat what you want to eat.

0:29:47.680,0:29:52.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:52.160,0:29:53.700
So, I want to leave you here.

0:29:53.700,0:29:55.460
Bless you.
