0:00:00.000,0:00:02.100
You, familiar spirit!

0:00:02.100,0:00:03.660
(Out!)

0:00:03.660,0:00:07.640
I say, you familiar spirit!

0:00:07.640,0:00:15.260
I say, these familiar spirits cause sickness and disease!

0:00:15.260,0:00:22.360
Whatever these familiar spirits might have caused you, its name is demon!

0:00:22.360,0:00:30.180
Its name is satan, destruction, killer!

0:00:30.180,0:00:39.100
You familiar spirits, we say to you, whatever you caused them – go out!

0:00:39.100,0:00:41.680
Go out!

0:00:41.680,0:00:58.460
Go out with your sickness, disease, failure, setback, nightmare, limitation! Out!

0:00:58.460,0:01:06.720
Out!

0:01:06.720,0:01:07.920
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:07.920,0:01:10.540
Don't come near me!

0:01:10.540,0:01:16.900
Please!

0:01:16.900,0:01:21.760
I am the queen of the river!

0:01:21.760,0:01:24.280
People of God: Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:01:24.280,0:01:27.940
My name is Ngozi Christiana Njoku

0:01:27.940,0:01:35.920
The girl standing beside me is my daughter, and next to her is my lovely mother.

0:01:35.920,0:01:38.860
It started when I was young.

0:01:38.860,0:01:44.640
In the village, a girl asked me to go to the stream with her.

0:01:44.640,0:01:48.540
I said, "OK, let's go to the stream" and I went with her.

0:01:48.540,0:01:55.000
When we got to the stream, she was teaching me how to swim.

0:01:55.000,0:02:04.840
Later on, I realised I was far out in a river and I felt something pulling my leg strongly -

0:02:04.840,0:02:08.880
it was trying to pull me under the water.

0:02:08.880,0:02:13.120
So, I started screaming and a lady came and pulled me out of the river.

0:02:13.120,0:02:20.620
I thought everything was over, I went to my house and I didn't tell my mother or father.

0:02:20.620,0:02:27.260
In time, I started having strange dreams and strange things would happen to me.

0:02:27.260,0:02:33.080
I would see snakes and a woman coming to crown me in my dreams.

0:02:33.080,0:02:37.300
She was a very beautiful woman wearing a gown and a crown on her head.

0:02:37.300,0:02:42.680
She would always come in my dreams to put a crown on my head.

0:02:42.680,0:02:50.780
As time went on, I thought everything was over; I didn't explain my experience to anybody.

0:02:50.780,0:02:56.660
I was in primary school then, after primary school, I went to secondary school.

0:02:56.660,0:03:02.280
When I got into the secondary school, a lady came to me and said that she was my 'school mother'.

0:03:02.280,0:03:10.300
I became bi-sexual and I became pregnant but the boy said he was not the father

0:03:10.300,0:03:12.640
and he didn't know anything about it.

0:03:12.640,0:03:17.840
I told him there was no problem then, I called my parents in Cameroon

0:03:17.840,0:03:21.520
and told my mother all that had happened to me.

0:03:21.520,0:03:25.700
She said, "My daughter, don't worry, everything will be over.

0:03:25.700,0:03:29.200
After delivery, carry the child and come over to us here in Cameroon."

0:03:29.200,0:03:37.180
After I delivered my daughter, I took her to Cameroon; she was two months old.

0:03:37.180,0:03:44.100
She started growing up with my parents but along the line, I saw that she was living the same life I was living.

0:03:44.100,0:03:47.320
I said, "God, what is happening to us?"

0:03:47.320,0:03:53.640
What happened to me was that I would see women like men, I didn't value men.

0:03:53.640,0:03:58.220
That was what happened to me after the woman crowned me in the dream.

0:03:58.220,0:04:02.700
OK. You said that later on you got involved in a relationship with a man and gave birth to your daughter,

0:04:02.700,0:04:03.680
who stands beside you.

0:04:03.680,0:04:08.140
Can you tell us at what age you gave birth to your daughter?

0:04:08.140,0:04:11.600
At the age of 14, I gave birth to my daughter.

0:04:11.600,0:04:23.600
I saw she was living the same life I was living and she also got pregnant at the age of 14.

0:04:23.600,0:04:27.460
I made her abort two pregnancies.

0:04:27.460,0:04:36.840
She was disturbing everyone in the house, she would not sleep in the house, she would go out and smoke.

0:04:36.840,0:04:41.600
I was worried, so I went to all the herbalists in Cameroon.

0:04:41.600,0:04:47.460
They finished all my money; I am a hairdresser by profession.

0:04:47.460,0:04:55.000
The last herbalist told me to give him money so he would buy a live snake and bury the snake in a coffin.

0:04:55.000,0:05:02.920
I gave him money and bought the coffin; he buried them but everything became worse.

0:05:02.920,0:05:04.620
I didn’t know what was happening.

0:05:04.620,0:05:10.260
What was the purpose of your going to this native doctor, who requested a live snake to bury it?

0:05:10.260,0:05:13.640
What was the purpose of going to all these native doctors?

0:05:13.640,0:05:18.620
I went to the native doctor because of my daughter, not even for my own case.

0:05:18.620,0:05:21.180
But after performing all these sacrifices nothing happened?

0:05:21.180,0:05:26.660
Nothing happened, except that case got worse and worse.

0:05:26.660,0:05:32.700
Can you now tell us more about the lifestyle you lived, as a result of your encounter with the queen of the cost?

0:05:32.700,0:05:36.280
Tell us more about the lifestyle and your experiences in life.

0:05:36.280,0:05:41.340
The experience I had was that man would come and propose to me with engagement rings

0:05:41.340,0:05:44.260
but later, they would go and not come back.

0:05:44.260,0:05:49.960
I began to wonder what was happening to me, at my age I was not married;

0:05:49.960,0:05:54.200
I didn’t know it was the spirit woman that was disturbing me.

0:05:54.200,0:05:57.420
I was watching Emmanuel TV and said to myself,

0:05:57.420,0:06:04.540
‘If this beautiful lady could stand and testify to the world what the Lord has done then, who am I?

0:06:04.540,0:06:13.340
I know I am proud of myself but I will put my pride and beauty aside.

0:06:13.340,0:06:17.840
I know that one day, God will see me through and I will testify of what He has done for me’.

0:06:17.840,0:06:22.420
That was how I decided to travel back home to Nigeria.

0:06:22.420,0:06:30.680
That was last Friday but my daughter knew I had planned to come to The SCOAN.

0:06:30.680,0:06:34.300
She left the house on Friday and didn’t come home.

0:06:34.300,0:06:40.240
I was crying to God as I didn’t understand what was happening;

0:06:40.240,0:06:44.580
when I called her phone, she was not answering my call.

0:06:44.580,0:06:50.900
I prayed and said, “God of T.B. Joshua, wherever this girl is, please bring her home”.

0:06:50.900,0:06:54.220
It was already late in the afternoon.

0:06:54.220,0:06:56.620
I was sleeping and my phone rang, it was my daughter saying,

0:06:56.620,0:07:00.940
"Mummy, I'm coming back; don’t be angry, I don’t want you to beat me."

0:07:00.940,0:07:02.840
I told her that I would not beat her and that she would come,

0:07:02.840,0:07:05.740
so we could go where we had planned to go – we would get the night bus.

0:07:05.740,0:07:09.360
That was how we left our place and came here.

0:07:09.360,0:07:12.920
So, that Sunday, you were at The SCOAN.

0:07:12.920,0:07:16.120
Can you tell us what actually happened on that day?

0:07:16.120,0:07:23.060
I had stopped going to church; I hadn't gone to church for four to five years.

0:07:23.060,0:07:32.880
So, when I entered the gates I made a vow to God that I would continue going to church.

0:07:32.880,0:07:39.500
When it was time for Mass Prayer, a spirit asked me,

0:07:39.500,0:07:44.900
"The vow you made that you will be going to church, are you sure you will fulfill it?"

0:07:44.900,0:07:49.280
I said, "Yes, I will be going to church every Sunday, no matter what."

0:07:49.280,0:07:56.840
Immediately I finished saying that I saw myself on the floor and found myself at the altar.

0:07:56.840,0:08:02.540
Ngozi Christiana Njoku & Family
Deliverance Testimony

0:08:02.540,0:08:06.460
Tell us what happened afterwards.

0:08:06.460,0:08:09.840
I am very happy and I am proud to be here.

0:08:09.840,0:08:11.420
Hallelujah!

0:08:11.420,0:08:15.360
The evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.

0:08:15.360,0:08:20.300
You are going to tell us the differences you have seen in your life, since you received your deliverance.

0:08:20.300,0:08:28.180
Can you now tell us once again, what was the life you were living in the past and what God has done for you?

0:08:28.180,0:08:35.260
Since I was delivered, when I see a woman, I see her as a woman and when I see a man, I see him as a man.

0:08:35.260,0:08:41.980
Before, I had relationships with women and I didn't see men as men - I saw women like men.

0:08:41.980,0:08:46.480
But now, when I see women, I see them as women and men as men.

0:08:46.480,0:08:48.880
I thank God for that.

0:08:48.880,0:08:56.180
Yesterday, my brother called me and asked how much I owed for store rent since I travelled to Niegeria

0:08:56.180,0:09:00.220
and how much I owed for my house rent - I was surprised.

0:09:00.220,0:09:02.720
This has never happened to me before!

0:09:02.720,0:09:07.920
No one had called to ask of my debts to pay, I was happy!

0:09:07.920,0:09:10.300
He promised that he would pay the rent.

0:09:10.300,0:09:15.600
Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:09:15.600,0:09:20.680
You have just listened to this life changing testimony from our sister,

0:09:20.680,0:09:24.400
who has been separated from the kingdom of darkness.

0:09:24.400,0:09:30.980
She said that in the past she had been living a very rough life and she was bisexual.

0:09:30.980,0:09:33.580
She was attracted to women like herself.

0:09:33.580,0:09:40.060
Her life, in a nutshell, was not in accordance with God's Word.

0:09:40.060,0:09:41.460
But that is her past.

0:09:41.460,0:09:47.760
As you know, Jesus Christ enters our lives to put an end to our past and give birth to our future.

0:09:47.760,0:09:51.800
That is exactly what God has done in the life of our sister.

0:09:51.800,0:09:55.700
Today, she is testifying that her past is indeed over.

0:09:55.700,0:10:02.840
Once again, let us rejoice with our sister by putting our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour -

0:10:02.840,0:10:05.280
Jesus Christ.

0:10:05.280,0:10:09.820
Before we go on, we want to listen to your advice, concerning what God has done in your life.

0:10:09.820,0:10:13.020
You mentioned your daughter, who is standing beside you.

0:10:13.020,0:10:17.860
We know she is going to be in the best position to share with us her testimony.

0:10:17.860,0:10:26.240
Before listening to her, we are going to watch TV once again, and see how she had received her deliverance.

0:10:26.240,0:10:27.280
Let us stay tuned.

0:10:27.280,0:10:32.020
DELIVERANCE TIME

0:10:32.020,0:10:36.860
The power of God flows through the faculties of Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:10:36.860,0:10:43.460
bringing healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings into the lives of the people,

0:10:43.460,0:10:47.060
who have come to The SCOAN.

0:10:47.060,0:10:52.220
As Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to pray for them, he encounters this lady,

0:10:52.220,0:10:55.140
who immediately begins to manifest.

0:10:55.140,0:10:57.740
Let's see what happens.

0:10:57.740,0:10:59.920
Who are you that destroyed the family?!

0:10:59.920,0:11:01.640
I am a queen!

0:11:01.640,0:11:02.660
How many of you are in this body

0:11:02.660,0:11:05.420
We are four!

0:11:05.420,0:11:09.960
Fire!

0:11:09.960,0:11:14.680
I will destroy her family!

0:11:14.680,0:11:17.840
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:11:17.840,0:11:20.860
My names are Anastasia Chinoso.

0:11:20.860,0:11:22.200
I am from Imo State, Nigeria.

0:11:22.200,0:11:23.600
I'm 18 years old.

0:11:23.600,0:11:32.300
At the age of 13 I was raped.

0:11:32.300,0:11:35.660
Since then my eyes were opened.

0:11:35.660,0:11:42.020
If I were sent to buy an egg, I would run away and never come back.

0:11:42.020,0:11:46.860
I would not come back home for one year and a month.

0:11:46.860,0:11:53.880
My mum sent some people to hold me but they would not see me.

0:11:53.880,0:11:57.280
When she sent me to school, I wouldn't go there directly.

0:11:57.280,0:12:05.940
I would just hang around with boys, smoke and drink, I would not concentrate on my education.

0:12:05.940,0:12:10.360
I was raped at the age of 13 years.

0:12:10.360,0:12:14.880
I was living a bad life, sleeping with men...

0:12:14.880,0:12:21.120
I got pregnant two times - these children were aborted.

0:12:21.120,0:12:24.980
Then my mum changed my school.

0:12:24.980,0:12:30.940
I was still living the same life, going around, smoking, going to clubs.

0:12:30.940,0:12:32.400
I would not concentrate.

0:12:32.400,0:12:36.160
When my mum was sending me anywhere, I would not come back, I would run away.

0:12:36.160,0:12:42.520
Even when I was at home with my mum, I wouldn't hear or obey her when she talked to me.

0:12:42.520,0:12:50.780
My grandmother and sisters - everybody in the family hated me because of my attitude and bad life.

0:12:50.780,0:12:54.060
They have changed my school seven times.

0:12:54.060,0:13:00.820
Seven times your mum changed your school, hoping that you would meet good friends.

0:13:00.820,0:13:05.180
Are you saying that all this did not bring any results?

0:13:05.180,0:13:15.880
Yes, she changed my school thinking that all this was because of my bad friends, but nothing changed.

0:13:15.880,0:13:17.620
That is how it was.

0:13:17.620,0:13:24.160
Friday, last week my mum told me that we would be going to T.B. Joshua.

0:13:24.160,0:13:27.140
I said OK.

0:13:27.140,0:13:30.880
In the afternoon, at around 3 o'clock she went out.

0:13:30.880,0:13:34.960
Then I decided not to go to T.B. Joshua.

0:13:34.960,0:13:39.680
My friend took me out of the house.

0:13:39.680,0:13:45.640
Since then my mum has been calling, to ask where I was.

0:13:45.640,0:13:48.120
I did not answer her calls.

0:13:48.120,0:13:59.260
She called one of my friends, asking her to bring me because we were expected to go to T.B. Joshua.

0:13:59.260,0:14:02.960
My friend said OK.

0:14:02.960,0:14:11.500
My friend called me and told me that my mum was looking for me and to go back home.

0:14:11.500,0:14:13.380
I said that I heard the message.

0:14:13.380,0:14:20.720
My mum called me again but I didn't pick up the phone.

0:14:20.720,0:14:24.920
Five minutes later my mum called me again.

0:14:24.920,0:14:33.940
I didn't want to pick up the phone because I didn't want to go anywhere.

0:14:33.940,0:14:37.980
So, what finally happened?

0:14:37.980,0:14:40.500
Five minutes later I was going home.

0:14:40.500,0:14:42.440
I called my mum before reaching home.

0:14:42.440,0:14:49.020
I told her that I was very sorry and I didn't want go back home because I was afraid that she would beat me.

0:14:49.020,0:14:53.020
She said, that I should come back home and that she would not beat me.

0:14:53.020,0:14:55.720
She said that we were going somewhere - I said "OK".

0:14:55.720,0:15:00.680
I came back home and then we entered the night bus and came here.

0:15:00.680,0:15:06.460
While entering the church, T.B. Joshua was coming near me.

0:15:06.460,0:15:07.920
I was so afraid.

0:15:07.920,0:15:13.920
I felt fire - it was burning my legs and my body.

0:15:13.920,0:15:20.520
That is when T.B. Joshua prayed for me and delivered me.

0:15:20.520,0:15:22.020
Now, I'm free.

0:15:22.020,0:15:26.120
Before I had dreams of snakes and other bad things.

0:15:26.120,0:15:28.980
But now, since T.B. Joshua delivered me...

0:15:28.980,0:15:31.680
I really thank God for what He did to me.

0:15:31.680,0:15:36.980
I do not have any bad dreams anymore.

0:15:36.980,0:15:40.060
Thank You, Jesus, I'm free.

0:15:40.060,0:15:43.360
When I went out, men would sleep with me.

0:15:43.360,0:15:49.620
They would only make promises and do nothing, they would only sleep with me.

0:15:49.620,0:15:54.860
So did big men, so did little boys...

0:15:54.860,0:15:59.800
How would you describe this type of life you were living then, in one word?

0:15:59.800,0:16:09.100
I was living a bad life, I didn't attend school regularly, I didn't concentrate on my education.

0:16:09.100,0:16:13.600
You have heard from our sister that in the past she was going out with different type of men, to the extent that

0:16:13.600,0:16:17.500
she had abandoned her school, and had no focus on her education.

0:16:17.500,0:16:21.260
Her life was focused mainly on men.

0:16:21.260,0:16:25.980
That was a kind of life she was living.

0:16:25.980,0:16:30.000
We can conclude what this kind of life is all about.

0:16:30.000,0:16:36.400
After your deliverance, can you tell us the changes you have seen in yourself?

0:16:36.400,0:16:46.180
The changes I have seen in myself: I don't have bad dreams anymore, I don't go out, I don't smoke or drink.

0:16:46.180,0:16:49.820
I really thank God for what T.B. Joshua did for me.

0:16:49.820,0:16:53.660
I really appreciate what he did for me.

0:16:53.660,0:17:02.620
Parents; I really want you to always take care of your children and focus on God.

0:17:02.620,0:17:06.040
Since your deliverance - you testify that that urge you used to have,

0:17:06.040,0:17:09.540
that pushed you to go out with different kind of men,

0:17:09.540,0:17:14.200
and made you to lose focus on your education is no more?

0:17:14.200,0:17:15.120
Yes.

0:17:15.120,0:17:20.480
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus for this wonderful thing He has done in the life of this sister,

0:17:20.480,0:17:26.080
rescuing her out of the captivity of satan, and bringing her back to light.

0:17:26.080,0:17:28.640
We give glory to God what He has done in your life.

0:17:28.640,0:17:31.500
I also thank you for that wonderful advice.

0:17:31.500,0:17:37.440
This woman here is my grandmother, and this one is my lovely mother.

0:17:37.440,0:17:41.020
Let us here from the grandmum.

0:17:41.020,0:17:44.560
Emmanuel!
(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

0:17:44.560,0:17:47.300
I am Elizabeth Njoku.

0:17:47.300,0:17:54.980
What I learnt last week about my daughter and granddaughter was terrible.

0:17:54.980,0:17:59.640
T.B. Joshua, may God bless you, in Jesus’ name.

0:17:59.640,0:18:00.940
(Amen.)

0:18:00.940,0:18:06.660
This is my first daughter and at times, she would be angry towards me.

0:18:06.660,0:18:14.820
When I talked to her, she would get annoyed and talk back to me rudely.

0:18:14.820,0:18:22.980
Since she has been delivered, there is nothing wrong with her anymore.

0:18:22.980,0:18:25.800
What about your gran daughter?

0:18:25.800,0:18:38.360
My granddaughter always disturbed me; I even wanted to die because of her.

0:18:38.360,0:18:49.100
I prayed to God Almighty to bless this girl for me, in Jesus’ name.

0:18:49.100,0:18:52.100
Tell us more about the lifestyle she lived then.

0:18:52.100,0:19:00.480
At times, when I would take her to the farm, she would run away from the farm.

0:19:00.480,0:19:06.580
If I sent her to buy me eggs, she would buy three, so it wouldn’t be enough;

0:19:06.580,0:19:11.420
so I would send her to buy three to five more eggs then, I wouldn’t see her again.

0:19:11.420,0:19:15.320
She would go out for two weeks, before coming here.

0:19:15.320,0:19:22.300
We heard from the grandmum; to the glory of God - she told us about the kind of life

0:19:22.300,0:19:27.040
the daughter and granddaughter lived in the past, before their deliverance.

0:19:27.040,0:19:31.520
Firstly, she talked about her daughter - she said that she was possessed

0:19:31.520,0:19:34.640
and that evil spirit made her to be very angry.

0:19:34.640,0:19:39.000
This anger created a lot of problems between the daughter and herself.

0:19:39.000,0:19:40.860
Whatever she told her, she would not listen.

0:19:40.860,0:19:47.480
But since her daughter's deliverance, she has seen a big difference in her - now she is a calm person.

0:19:47.480,0:19:54.140
She was telling us also about her granddaughter, the lifestyle she lived in the past -

0:19:54.140,0:19:57.340
she would leave the house and not return in days.

0:19:57.340,0:20:01.620
Tell us more about the kind of lifestyle your granddaughter was living then.

0:20:01.620,0:20:07.520
She was smoking, drinking alcohol and going to clubs.

0:20:07.520,0:20:17.220
When I looked for her but didn’t see her, I would ask God to bring her back safely.

0:20:17.220,0:20:21.680
The woman said that when she would take her granddaughter to the farm,

0:20:21.680,0:20:27.240
she would just disappear and wouldn't be seen for days.

0:20:27.240,0:20:33.720
She then engaged in a vigorous prayer to get her granddaughter back home.

0:20:33.720,0:20:36.660
Tell us how the lifestyle of your daughter affected you.

0:20:36.660,0:20:42.600
What kind of men did you see going out and spending time with her?

0:20:42.600,0:20:47.140
How did this affect her education in her childhood?

0:20:47.140,0:20:52.040
The men were many, I cannot count them; there were a lot.

0:20:52.040,0:20:57.820
I saw a few of them and when I saw them, I drove them away from my compound.

0:20:57.820,0:21:01.860
She would get angry and ask why I drove them away and I would tell her,

0:21:01.860,0:21:05.800
"This is my house, it does not belong to you".

0:21:05.800,0:21:10.180
The grandmother is explaining that the granddaughter was living a very bad life,

0:21:10.180,0:21:15.280
she was going out with a lot of men - she cannot even give account of the number of men

0:21:15.280,0:21:16.940
she used to go out with.

0:21:16.940,0:21:22.100
A lot of men would throng in her compound to see her granddaughter.

0:21:22.100,0:21:28.460
She would have to spend time driving these men away from her compound, making it known to them clearly

0:21:28.460,0:21:33.660
that this house belonged to her and not them, so they should not come to her compound again.

0:21:33.660,0:21:36.600
Tell us more, madam.

0:21:36.600,0:21:42.280
At my age, I was born in 1960, it was not easy to look after her.

0:21:42.280,0:21:48.420
God used T.B. Joshua to settle everything that has to do with her.

0:21:48.420,0:21:51.380
So, I too am free, in Jesus' name!

0:21:51.380,0:21:57.440
Madam, can you now tell us once again, since your daughter's deliverance, tell us exactly

0:21:57.440,0:22:03.240
what are the changes, big differences, you have noticed in the life of your granddaughter?

0:22:03.240,0:22:07.820
She had anger before but now, she is at peace with her mother.

0:22:07.820,0:22:12.340
She has really changed now, in Jesus' name.

0:22:12.340,0:22:18.460
Sister, can you tell us your own advice to people listening to you all over the world?

0:22:18.460,0:22:27.620
My advice to the world is, I will use what Prophet T.B. Joshua said last Sunday,

0:22:27.620,0:22:35.540
for gold to be gold, it must face challenges and to face challenges you need faith.

0:22:35.540,0:22:40.740
People all around the world, have faith – distance is not a barrier.

0:22:40.740,0:22:48.020
Leave your beauty, leave your pride and everything behind – just come to God;

0:22:48.020,0:22:54.360
confess your sins and be free just as I did, in Jesus' name.

0:22:54.360,0:22:57.640

Deliverance Testimony

0:22:57.640,0:23:03.280
We heard from our sister; no matter the problem or situation you face in life - you should run to God,

0:23:03.280,0:23:04.660
and He is able to see you through.

0:23:04.660,0:23:09.080
Yes, we give glory to God for what He has done in your life and we thank you for a wonderful advice.

0:23:09.080,0:23:14.680
We want to advise you - that God Almighty has taken you out of the kingdom of darkness and brought you

0:23:14.680,0:23:20.280
into the Kingdom of Light - the primary reason for this is the salvation of your soul.

0:23:20.280,0:23:26.600
Make sure you stand firm in the Word of God, make His Word a foundation of your life and your home

0:23:26.600,0:23:31.520
and that Word will continue to set you on the good road to the good life.

0:23:31.520,0:23:36.100
Once again, let us put our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,

0:23:36.100,0:23:38.400
for what He has done in the life of this family.
