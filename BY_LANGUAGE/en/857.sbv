0:00:00.000,0:00:04.000
Tomorrow is mystery.

0:00:04.000,0:00:13.100
Satan believes he can hit us; he can cause us pain.

0:00:13.100,0:00:21.100
That pain will drag us away from Jesus, whereas that pain strengthens our desire the more.

0:00:21.100,0:00:27.020
But if you are not a real Christian, pain cannot strengthen your desire.

0:00:27.020,0:00:32.120
You can know whether you're a real Christian or just a Christian by mouth.

0:00:32.120,0:00:35.000
You see people say, "I'm a Christian". You too are a Christian.

0:00:35.000,0:00:41.560
But you are a real Christian by heart.

0:00:41.560,0:00:52.320
If you are a real Christian, situations strengthen your desire and determination for God.

0:00:52.320,0:00:54.720
This is how we know we are Christians.

0:00:54.720,0:00:59.620
Many people keep asking me, "T.B. Joshua, how do we know we are Christians?"

0:00:59.620,0:01:10.100
You know you are a Christian when your situation strengthens your desire and determination for God.

0:01:10.100,0:01:14.020
Tell your neighbor, "You know you are a Christian

0:01:14.020,0:01:24.640
when your situation strengthens your desire and determination for Jesus".

0:01:24.640,0:01:30.880
That is when you will say, "Ah, this situation is too much because I'm not a Christian.

0:01:30.880,0:01:32.420
Why this failure?"

0:01:32.420,0:01:41.620
No, we don't measure our Christian lives by the situations or trials we are going through.

0:01:41.620,0:01:50.840
You know you are a Christian when your situations, trials, temptations become the object

0:01:50.840,0:01:55.860
of strengthening your desire and determination for God.

0:01:55.860,0:01:59.080
"Ah, you are a Christian!"

0:01:59.080,0:02:03.260
It becomes an object that strengthens your desire.

0:02:03.260,0:02:05.340
Let me give you a good example.

0:02:05.340,0:02:10.920
When you are thirsty, there would be a strong urge for water.

0:02:10.920,0:02:12.560
Are you with me?

0:02:12.560,0:02:16.540
When you are thirsty, there will be what?

0:02:16.540,0:02:21.540
A strong urge for what? - For water. You want to drink.

0:02:21.540,0:02:28.920
So also, situations cause us urge for who?

0:02:28.920,0:02:32.140
For God.

0:02:32.140,0:02:37.960
Tell your neighbor, "Situations cause our urge for who?"

0:02:37.960,0:02:39.980
[For God.]

0:02:39.980,0:02:41.860
Then, you are a Christian.

0:02:41.860,0:02:45.480
You pray once in the morning, but because of a situation you have,

0:02:45.480,0:02:47.380
you started praying three times.

0:02:47.380,0:02:54.520
After a little time, "In Jesus' name" because you believe He is the only who can rescue you.

0:02:54.520,0:03:02.480
You have no other way. Situations cannot determine your position before God.

0:03:02.480,0:03:14.660
When I say situation, it could be temptation, sickness, hardship, failure.

0:03:14.660,0:03:17.080
When you are thirsty now, you cannot sit down.

0:03:17.080,0:03:22.460
You will be, "Ah, I need water. I need water".  When you now see water, you will be like...

0:03:22.460,0:03:26.000
The way you grab it, you want to drink it.

0:03:26.000,0:03:31.180
So also, when a situation comes, you run to Jesus!

0:03:31.180,0:03:32.840
What is the position of satan now?

0:03:32.840,0:03:36.680
He is a foolish man because he is the cause of that situation.

0:03:36.680,0:03:43.160
I never knew that the situation is the urge that we have for Jesus.

0:03:43.160,0:03:46.880
So when that situation now becomes an object of urge,

0:03:46.880,0:03:52.420
the reason why you run to Jesus and satan is the cause of it, he is useless to you.

0:03:52.420,0:03:54.820
He has no bearing.

0:03:54.820,0:03:58.480
But rather, the opposite is the case today.

0:03:58.480,0:04:01.960
When situations come, you begin to lament.

0:04:01.960,0:04:07.040
When that one inside you causes you to lament, to cry,

0:04:07.040,0:04:11.120
instead of causing you to run to Him and fast more, pray the more,

0:04:11.120,0:04:16.140
you now begin to lament, "Why this one?

0:04:16.140,0:04:20.700
I go to church always. I don't know why all this. I pray, I fast.

0:04:20.700,0:04:25.280
I have not been smoking like before and I have not even been following my friends to party.

0:04:25.280,0:04:27.460
I have not been going to nightclubs again.

0:04:27.460,0:04:28.980
Why all this?

0:04:28.980,0:04:33.960
Even when I was going to nightclubs, I never faced all these crises. Why this crisis?"

0:04:33.960,0:04:36.520
You'll  know you're not a Christian.

0:04:36.520,0:04:42.200
You are just a Christian by mouth.

0:04:42.200,0:04:46.460
So I hope you can know whether you are a Christian now.

0:04:46.460,0:04:47.940
You can know now.

0:04:47.940,0:04:55.120
You know when your situation causes you urge to run to Jesus.

0:04:55.120,0:05:00.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:00.420,0:05:05.520
If anyone or anybody is telling you that because you are a Christian,

0:05:05.520,0:05:07.160
no situations - ah!

0:05:07.160,0:05:12.460
If no situation because you are a Christian, how do you grow in your Christian life?

0:05:12.460,0:05:17.300
Ask your neighbor, "How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?"

0:05:17.300,0:05:18.540
Ask your neighbor.

0:05:18.540,0:05:21.520
[How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?]

0:05:21.520,0:05:22.720
Ask your neighbor.

0:05:22.720,0:05:25.920
[How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?]

0:05:25.920,0:05:26.760
Again.

0:05:26.760,0:05:28.060
[How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?]

0:05:28.060,0:05:31.580
Write it down.

0:05:31.580,0:05:35.960
Because those little things, they are things that are disturbing your life.

0:05:35.960,0:05:38.480
They are things that disturb your relationship with God.

0:05:38.480,0:05:40.700
You are lost already because of situations.

0:05:40.700,0:05:47.020
How will you grow in your Christian life when there is no situation?

0:05:47.020,0:05:51.380
You cannot grow in your Christian life if only joy, joy, food, food,

0:05:51.380,0:05:54.140
progress, progress, breakthrough, breakthrough.

0:05:54.140,0:05:57.260
Breakthrough causes us to relax.

0:05:57.260,0:06:00.600
When there is breakthrough, that cannot cause you to pray the more.

0:06:00.600,0:06:04.340
Rather, you dress well; you have time to comb your hair.

0:06:04.340,0:06:09.560
Sitting down, even when you want to come to Jesus. No!

0:06:09.560,0:06:14.280
How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?

0:06:14.280,0:06:22.380
Like I have said, situations could be barrenness, sickness, poverty, hardship,

0:06:22.380,0:06:30.340
setback, temptation of any form.

0:06:30.340,0:06:34.460
And these are the things you are now facing.

0:06:34.460,0:06:41.460
These are the things that cause you to abandon your post.

0:06:41.460,0:06:49.980
Instead of these things to draw you close to God, they are now taking you away from God.

0:06:49.980,0:06:51.960
Ok, look at T.B. Joshua today.

0:06:51.960,0:06:54.780
You know me. You've read so much about me.

0:06:54.780,0:06:57.740
If there is any man of God in the world, because of persecution,

0:06:57.740,0:07:00.700
you know more about T.B. Joshua than any other man or God

0:07:00.700,0:07:03.180
because you are interested in T.B. Joshua.

0:07:03.180,0:07:05.240
Five years ago, they were giving me four years.

0:07:05.240,0:07:11.320
"See whether he will spend four years." - You have been monitoring when he will go.

0:07:11.320,0:07:18.020
Many of us rebuked, fasted and prayed in the past that this church would collapse - ignorantly.

0:07:18.020,0:07:20.500
But you realised that that prayer refused to answer.

0:07:20.500,0:07:22.640
You are now showing interest, "I will see".

0:07:22.640,0:07:30.100
"Ah, this man! We prayed that he should fall but instead of falling, itÂ´s growing.

0:07:30.100,0:07:33.540
What is the cause of all this, my God?"

0:07:33.540,0:07:39.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:39.000,0:07:45.760
So this is why the Bible says that we should not destroy relationships beyond what?

0:07:45.760,0:07:47.120
- Beyond repair.

0:07:47.120,0:07:55.140
If you have a relationship, relationship is fundamental; it's of God.

0:07:55.140,0:07:57.680
When there's trouble, be careful.

0:07:57.680,0:08:05.480
Even when you husband and wife want to divorce, that should not end the relationship.

0:08:05.480,0:08:07.680
Don't destroy it beyond repair.

0:08:07.680,0:08:13.760
If you destroy it beyond repair, the person you are fighting may be a savior tomorrow for you.

0:08:13.760,0:08:15.500
How will you meet the person?

0:08:15.500,0:08:20.980
MESSAGE TITLE: TOMORROW IS MYSTERY

0:08:20.980,0:08:27.780
The person you are fighting, he has done so much against you - so bad.

0:08:27.780,0:08:31.620
Whether husband and wife, you want to divorce. Okay.

0:08:31.620,0:08:37.640
After the divorce, you continue praying for that man and the man should continue praying for you.

0:08:37.640,0:08:40.420
He can give you a call at any time, "Hello. How are you?

0:08:40.420,0:08:42.260
I just want to know how you are doing".

0:08:42.260,0:08:44.340
Because that relationship has been there.

0:08:44.340,0:08:47.260
"Oh, thank you!"

0:08:47.260,0:08:51.640
"Happy New Year!" -  You may be the first person he will give a call to.

0:08:51.640,0:08:54.800
" I just want to greet you."

0:08:54.800,0:09:04.760
Let it remain like that because he or she may be your saviour tomorrow.

0:09:04.760,0:09:09.080
"No! Over my dead body. We meet in Heaven."

0:09:09.080,0:09:13.700
Who told you you will go to Heaven?

0:09:13.700,0:09:16.780
Are you with me?

0:09:16.780,0:09:20.400
Don't destroy a relationship beyond what?

0:09:20.400,0:09:21.600
[Repair.]

0:09:21.600,0:09:23.680
No matter what happens.

0:09:23.680,0:09:30.160
Tell your neighbor, "Don't destroy a relationship beyond repair".

0:09:30.160,0:09:39.960
Yes, satan is our accuser.

0:09:39.960,0:09:44.020
And satan is a spirit being.

0:09:44.020,0:09:47.420
We are not fighting flesh and blood.

0:09:47.420,0:09:51.920
I cannot stand here and begin to abuse the flesh, abuse a person,

0:09:51.920,0:09:55.620
abuse the name, call them names, no.

0:09:55.620,0:10:02.700
The Bible says we are fighting spirit being, not flesh and blood.

0:10:02.700,0:10:08.460
And satan is a type of foolish man that can enter one today,

0:10:08.460,0:10:12.260
use the person badly and leave the person.

0:10:12.260,0:10:18.140
And the person you see as a satan yesterday becomes a savior tomorrow.

0:10:18.140,0:10:24.120
How will you handle the situation if you have destroyed the person?

0:10:24.120,0:10:30.220
This is what we are seeing here - deliverance - people that have done a lot being delivered.

0:10:30.220,0:10:33.420
Now being delivered, he is becoming a child of God.

0:10:33.420,0:10:36.280
If the person had been destroyed,

0:10:36.280,0:10:42.160
the opportunity to become a child of God would not be there again.

0:10:42.160,0:10:52.680
One thing I know you are lacking is the spirit of forgiveness;

0:10:52.680,0:10:56.820
you may have it but not genuinely.

0:10:56.820,0:11:02.600
If you have that genuine spirit of forgiveness, you should also forget.

0:11:02.600,0:11:07.080
You forgive but you refuse to forget.

0:11:07.080,0:11:10.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service.

0:11:10.820,0:11:15.600
You do forgive but you fail to forget.

0:11:15.600,0:11:20.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service.

0:11:20.800,0:11:25.700
As if what they have done to you, you have not done it to someone in the past.

0:11:25.700,0:11:28.480
ThatÂ´s how you judge yourself.

0:11:28.480,0:11:32.300
What they are doing to you, ask yourself,

0:11:32.300,0:11:36.980
"Are you saying, you have not done that to someone in the past?"

0:11:36.980,0:11:42.380
This is the judgment Jesus gave to this woman

0:11:42.380,0:11:55.040
when she was accused and they were about to stone her to death by the law of Moses.

0:11:55.040,0:12:02.300
Fortunately, they run to Jesus and asked Him,

0:12:02.300,0:12:04.620
"How will you judge this woman?

0:12:04.620,0:12:13.260
The law says, anyone who commits adultery should be stoned to death.

0:12:13.260,0:12:19.780
Here is the woman now and it is written by our law".

0:12:19.780,0:12:25.200
They were looking for something to accuse Jesus Himself, not even the woman alone.

0:12:25.200,0:12:28.720
They wanted to bring Jesus into that accusation

0:12:28.720,0:12:35.120
so they were looking for something to get Him, as a set-up.

0:12:35.120,0:12:39.220
And Jesus said, "Well, it is written in your law

0:12:39.220,0:12:44.880
that anyone that committed adultery should be stoned to death".

0:12:44.880,0:12:50.020
He now went on his knees and wrote on the ground.

0:12:50.020,0:12:55.340
When he wrote on the ground, He looked at it and looked at them,

0:12:55.340,0:12:58.400
"Look, what I'm seeing here is,

0:12:58.400,0:13:03.100
if anyone of you has never committed what this woman has committed,

0:13:03.100,0:13:06.940
such person should stone that woman to death".

0:13:06.940,0:13:12.920
They looked at themselves, "It's true. What this woman has committed, I have committed it in the past.

0:13:12.920,0:13:20.960
Oh! I've committed it in the past". Immediately they dropped their stones and took to their heels.

0:13:20.960,0:13:25.080
And Jesus said, "Where are these people that accused you?"

0:13:25.080,0:13:27.220
They could not be found.

0:13:27.220,0:13:31.320
And Jesus said, "I have nothing against you. Go and sin no more".

0:13:31.320,0:13:35.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:35.020,0:13:39.440
So that is the reason why you have to forgive.

0:13:39.440,0:13:46.160
Everything they have accused you of, so bitter.

0:13:46.160,0:13:54.800
If you look back, far, you will know that you have also committed it in the past.

0:13:54.800,0:14:00.340
Who are you to judge?

0:14:00.340,0:14:03.440
Finally, take this word.

0:14:03.440,0:14:14.860
When you are at home, sitting down, before you start praying,

0:14:14.860,0:14:21.420
there are many things you need to do.

0:14:21.420,0:14:31.120
Think about your antecedent, where you are coming from, your past record.

0:14:31.120,0:14:34.180
You may not be able to remember when you were little,

0:14:34.180,0:14:41.900
but the little you can remember, just bring it to your present.

0:14:41.900,0:14:50.920
When you bring all this to your present, you will know that enemies cannot kill you.

0:14:50.920,0:14:54.580
It is your fear of enemies that kills you.

0:14:54.580,0:15:06.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:06.240,0:15:09.140
They cannot kill you; it's your fear.

0:15:09.140,0:15:15.440
When they attack you and fear comes to you, that fear develops hypertension,

0:15:15.440,0:15:30.140
heart attack, depression and these things become sickness, leading to death.

0:15:30.140,0:15:33.260
Attacks on your business cannot destroy your business.

0:15:33.260,0:15:37.440
It is the fear of that attack that destroys your business.

0:15:37.440,0:15:41.200
Attacks on your health cannot kill you.

0:15:41.200,0:15:46.220
If they give you poison, it cannot kill you but the fear of that.

0:15:46.220,0:15:49.740
When you begin to remember people they have given poison to or when you meet your doctor

0:15:49.740,0:15:53.980
and the doctor says, "Oh no! Go and write your will", that is fear.

0:15:53.980,0:15:55.800
You are dead already.

There is nothing you have gone through that someone has not gone through in the past.

0:16:12.380,0:16:17.120
There is nothing you are facing that someone has not faced in the past

0:16:17.120,0:16:20.280
and you know what became of them.

0:16:20.280,0:16:23.300
But what is your problem?

0:16:23.300,0:16:26.800
Why are you easily forgetting the history?

0:16:26.800,0:16:31.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:31.300,0:16:34.800
The Bible is our standard.

0:16:34.800,0:16:38.680
Take your Bible and read; you will have your role model.

0:16:38.680,0:16:41.940
If you cannot get any role model in this earth,

0:16:41.940,0:16:47.760
by the time you read your Bible, you will find your role model in your Bible.

0:16:54.980,0:16:59.580
Time is too short.

0:16:59.580,0:17:09.540
We have wasted our time on this, our marriage, our education, relationships.

0:17:09.540,0:17:12.840
We keep wasting our time, coming back to where we started.

0:17:12.840,0:17:14.900
You go this way.

0:17:14.900,0:17:17.440
You come back again to where you started.

0:17:17.440,0:17:19.580
You go that way.

0:17:19.580,0:17:21.240
You come back again to where you started.

0:17:21.240,0:17:24.720
That is your life. I'm just telling you your life.

0:17:24.720,0:17:29.420
"Some day, when I go to America, I will be great after I have spent 20 years there."

0:17:29.420,0:17:34.860
After getting to America, after 30 years, you will go back to where you started.

0:17:34.860,0:17:40.060
"If I had a billion dollars, I would start a business and become great."

0:17:40.060,0:17:45.600
You get the billion dollars and at the end of the day, again back to where you started.

0:17:45.600,0:17:49.340
There is nothing you have not tried.

0:17:49.340,0:17:53.180
If there is anything you have not tried, it is Jesus!

0:17:53.180,0:17:58.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:58.160,0:18:04.260
Tell your neighbor, "If there is anything I have not tried, it is Jesus!"

0:18:04.260,0:18:08.260
Because your following Jesus is your own way of following.

0:18:08.260,0:18:10.920
You have not followed Jesus genuinely.

0:18:10.920,0:18:13.940
You have to say the truth. You have not.

0:18:13.940,0:18:19.000
You are hearing from me now that your situation is meant to strengthen your desire, your determination

0:18:19.000,0:18:22.100
and this is the first time you are hearing this kind of thing.

0:18:22.100,0:18:26.540
And if you have heard it in the past, you have not been putting it into practice.

0:18:26.540,0:18:31.740
When trouble comes, you are crying. Is that someone who is following Jesus?

0:18:31.740,0:18:33.820
How do we test your faith? You say you are a Christian.

0:18:33.820,0:18:36.940
So if you are a Christian now, they should not test your faith?

0:18:36.940,0:18:39.720
Anything that is not tested is not genuine.

0:18:39.720,0:18:40.840
Tell your neighbor.

0:18:40.840,0:18:43.600
[Anything that is not tested is not genuine.]

0:18:43.600,0:18:46.980
Because you want to start as fake.

0:18:46.980,0:18:50.220
Why are you afraid of tests?

0:18:50.220,0:18:55.020
Sickness tests you - you are complaining. How do we know you are genuine?

0:18:55.020,0:18:59.660
Failure tests you - you complain. How do we know you are genuine?

0:18:59.660,0:19:04.500
Temptation comes - you complain.  How do we know you are genuine?

0:19:04.500,0:19:09.020
Tribulation comes - you complain. How do we know you are genuine?

0:19:09.020,0:19:15.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:15.300,0:19:21.460
Tell your neighbor, "Anything that is not tested is not genuine".

0:19:21.460,0:19:26.360
You know the temptation Jesus went through.

0:19:26.360,0:19:31.160
A lot of tests.

0:19:31.160,0:19:35.140
So when sickness comes, it is a test to know whether you are genuine.

0:19:35.140,0:19:39.580
But you keep complaining, "Now I serve Jesus. I know Jesus.

0:19:39.580,0:19:43.760
Why is all this happening to me? Why this setback? I donÂ´t know. I'm tired".

0:19:43.760,0:19:45.960
Because of that, you donÂ´t pray again.

0:19:45.960,0:19:50.920
After a while you continue praying but you have already revoked,

0:19:50.920,0:19:53.200
you have complained.

0:19:53.200,0:20:02.240
When those things come, it is to remind you, "This is to test my genuineness,

0:20:02.240,0:20:08.560
whether I am truly a child of God, for Jesus or fake".

0:20:08.560,0:20:12.620
It's a test. Anything that is not tested is not genuine.

0:20:12.620,0:20:21.060
Don't cry, murmur, lament when tests come in any form.

0:20:21.060,0:20:24.140
You allow tests to separate your marriage.

0:20:24.140,0:20:27.140
You allow tests to destroy your business.

0:20:27.140,0:20:29.800
You allow tests to destroy your health.

0:20:29.800,0:20:32.740
You allow tests to destroy your life.

0:20:32.740,0:20:35.900
A lot of marriages today that are supposed to be together -

0:20:35.900,0:20:41.420
the troubles that were not supposed to separate them but little trouble - divorce.

0:20:41.420,0:20:44.720
Temptation comes - divorce. Sickness comes - divorce.

0:20:44.720,0:20:46.480
Hardship comes - divorce.

0:20:46.480,0:20:48.140
The same thing, business partner.

0:20:48.140,0:20:53.460
A lot of businesses have been scattered because of this temptation.

0:20:53.460,0:20:58.020
Church - you stop coming to church because of trouble you are going through.

0:20:58.020,0:21:02.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:02.520,0:21:13.000
The area I know all of us have wronged is the way we handle relationships.

0:21:13.000,0:21:18.020
Everybody has wronged there.

0:21:18.020,0:21:22.760
Everybody is wrong when it comes to that relationship issue

0:21:22.760,0:21:29.800
because we have destroyed relationships beyond repair.

0:21:29.800,0:21:34.540
No matter what anybody might have done to you, be careful.

0:21:34.540,0:21:38.780
Make sure you have not destroyed your relationship with the person

0:21:38.780,0:21:42.940
to the extent that in the future, you cannot go to him or her.

0:21:42.940,0:21:45.760
Beyond repair is bad.

0:21:45.760,0:21:53.740
God always uses people we have fought with, have issue with and see as enemies

0:21:53.740,0:21:57.460
to be our savior in the future.

0:21:57.460,0:22:00.840
This is what is happening all over the world today.

0:22:00.840,0:22:05.300
You just go to many companies. You want business or you need help.

0:22:05.300,0:22:09.120
By the time you walk inside the company, you'll find that, "Ha!",

0:22:09.120,0:22:11.980
you want to walk back with your back.

0:22:11.980,0:22:16.340
"No problem, I will come back."

0:22:16.340,0:22:25.000
What happened? Somebody that used to be your driver in the past,

0:22:25.000,0:22:29.620
has now become the MD of the big company.

0:22:29.620,0:22:33.800
You have done so bad to him.

0:22:33.800,0:22:43.220
You now turn back and say, "Ah, I will come back. Oga, I will come back".

0:22:43.220,0:22:47.720
You will now begin to ask yourself, "Maybe I have gone to the wrong office".

0:22:47.720,0:22:51.260
It was not the wrong office. That was the office you needed to go to.

0:22:51.260,0:22:54.720
