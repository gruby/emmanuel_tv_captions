0:00:00.000,0:00:01.080
Can I talk to you?

0:00:01.080,0:00:01.920
Yes.

0:00:01.920,0:00:05.040
There is an embarrassment in your life.

0:00:05.040,0:00:07.720
Do you know what I mean by an embarrassment?

0:00:07.720,0:00:11.760
Something you cannot tell anyone.

0:00:11.760,0:00:15.340
It is something you don't want anyone to know.

0:00:15.340,0:00:17.820
It's only you.

0:00:17.820,0:00:22.780
You keep it to yourself and you don't want people to know.

0:00:22.780,0:00:23.540
Yes, sir.

0:00:23.540,0:00:25.840
Do you want me to mention it?

0:00:25.840,0:00:26.580
No

0:00:26.580,0:00:30.600
I should not mention it?

0:00:30.600,0:00:34.040
No, let us put shame to satan.

0:00:34.040,0:00:36.100
Bedwetting.

0:00:36.100,0:00:37.420
Yes, sir.

0:00:37.420,0:00:43.100
You just sleep and you see yourself wetting the bed.

0:00:43.100,0:00:50.580
As I am saying it, it is gone.

0:00:50.580,0:00:55.740
It is gone.

0:00:55.740,0:00:57.740
Father, thank You, Lord.

0:00:57.740,0:01:00.320
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:01:00.320,0:01:03.300
Amen

TESTIMONY TIME

0:01:16.620,0:01:20.680
Emmanuel! 
(God with us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:20.680,0:01:23.420
People of God, I have good news to share.

0:01:23.420,0:01:27.440
My name is Elysia Straub. I come from the United States.

0:01:27.440,0:01:29.720
Who is the sister besides you here?

0:01:29.720,0:01:32.520
This here is my beautiful mother Galina.

0:01:32.520,0:01:37.660
Last week, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me a prophecy.

0:01:37.660,0:01:43.540
He walked up to me and said, "Sister, you have something that you don't want to share with anyone.

0:01:43.540,0:01:46.060
You have a secret".

0:01:46.060,0:01:48.140
I know, I didn't say yes.

0:01:48.140,0:01:54.860
He said that it was a generational curse, which was bedwetting.

0:01:54.860,0:01:58.640
Afterwards, he placed his hand upon me.

0:01:58.640,0:02:01.700
I fell to the ground. I felt released, free.

0:02:01.700,0:02:03.920
I felt the Holy Spirit inside of me.

0:02:03.920,0:02:12.840
Tell us more about this problem of bedwetting, how it started and how it really affected your life negatively?

0:02:12.840,0:02:17.720
I had this problem of bedwetting since childhood.

0:02:17.720,0:02:23.200
Every time I went to other peoples' places, I'd feel ashamed about it.

0:02:23.200,0:02:30.600
I felt isolated, rejected. I felt that I was not accepted for who I am.

0:02:30.600,0:02:36.140
This is something that has been happening to you right from childhood that you have been bedwetting.

0:02:36.140,0:02:37.120
Yes, sir.

0:02:37.120,0:02:42.640
Explain to us - each time it happened, how did it affect you negatively - both socially and

0:02:42.640,0:02:46.400
in terms of your relationship with others? How did it make you feel?

0:02:46.400,0:02:50.560
Normally when I would go to sleep - I am usually a light sleeper -

0:02:50.560,0:02:57.800
every time before the middle of the night, when I slept very deeply, I felt like someone was holding me down.

0:02:57.800,0:03:05.820
It won't let me go. The only time when I'd wake up is when I felt wet.

0:03:05.820,0:03:09.680
I felt ashamed, so I kept it as a secret from others.

0:03:09.680,0:03:16.820
I felt isolated. I didn't want to be with anyone else after this happened. I felt guilty inside.

0:03:16.820,0:03:20.460
You mentioned at the beginning that this was actually a generational curse.

0:03:20.460,0:03:25.260
Can you explain more about how this affected the whole family?

0:03:25.260,0:03:28.720
I wasn't the only one; I also had a family member,

0:03:28.720,0:03:33.540
who's my uncle and also had this issue. He felt very ashamed of it.

0:03:33.540,0:03:38.940
So did my other family members, such as my little cousins.

0:03:38.940,0:03:41.600
As a young lady looking ahead to the future,

0:03:41.600,0:03:46.340
how did you feel knowing that you had this problem in terms of moving forward in life,

0:03:46.340,0:03:49.020
maybe wanting to get married later on?

0:03:49.020,0:03:53.140
How did it make you feel knowing that you had this terrible secret?

0:03:53.140,0:03:55.580
I felt that there was no hope for me.

0:03:55.580,0:04:00.780
I thought about what would happen to me in the future, "Will this continue,

0:04:00.780,0:04:07.960
will I get married, will my children and my children's children have the same generational curse?"

0:04:07.960,0:04:12.400
We really understand from our sister how serious this problem of bedwetting was.

0:04:12.400,0:04:16.080
You said that you kept this as a secret, is that right?

0:04:16.080,0:04:17.820
Yes, sir.

0:04:17.820,0:04:22.820
Wow. Tell us - how did you come to hear about The SCOAN

0:04:22.820,0:04:26.680
and actually be here today in the presence of God.

0:04:26.680,0:04:35.200
I heard about The SCOAN through family members.

0:04:35.200,0:04:42.120
They knew I had this problem, so they told my mother, and we also watched the YouTube videos.

0:04:42.120,0:04:46.880
OK, so you learned about the ministry and thank God you came here.

0:04:46.880,0:04:51.500
Tell us - how did you feel last week, when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua approached you

0:04:51.500,0:04:55.020
and gave you this word of prophecy, something you did not disclose to him -

0:04:55.020,0:04:58.520
a secret that you kept, that only you and your family members knew about.

0:04:58.520,0:05:02.260
How did you feel when this word of prophecy was given?

0:05:02.260,0:05:04.860
When he first came up to me...

0:05:04.860,0:05:13.480
During screening, when I was supposed to write down my problems, I did not add bedwetting.

0:05:13.480,0:05:20.540
When the Prophet came up to me, he said exactly what I should have put on the placard.

0:05:20.540,0:05:27.260
I was so shocked; this was exactly why I came here - to be freed from this curse.

0:05:27.260,0:05:32.000
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:05:32.000,0:05:33.300
I hope we understand our sister.

0:05:33.300,0:05:36.300
She said that when she was asked about her problems before,

0:05:36.300,0:05:39.780
she was too ashamed to even mention bedwetting on her placard

0:05:39.780,0:05:41.880
when it was time for her to go to the prayer line.

0:05:41.880,0:05:46.760
But God, through Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed exactly what her problem was

0:05:46.760,0:05:49.600
and that word of prophecy is what we are seeing on the screen here.

0:05:49.600,0:05:53.440
Sister, we saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for you and you fell to the ground.

0:05:53.440,0:05:56.820
What happened when he prayed for you, what were your experiences?

0:05:56.820,0:06:03.580
I felt released. I felt lighter. I felt free in Jesus' mighty name.

0:06:03.580,0:06:08.740
Wow. Ever since that prayer and that prophecy, tell us your experiences.

0:06:08.740,0:06:13.680
Ever since that day happened, I have been free, I have been dry on my bed,

0:06:13.680,0:06:17.240
I feel enlightened, happy and joyful.

0:06:17.240,0:06:21.880
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:21.880,0:06:26.320
You said before that in your sleep, you felt something pressing you down,

0:06:26.320,0:06:30.940
a nightmare attacking you, pressing you down, until you woke up and found the bed wet.

0:06:30.940,0:06:35.580
Tell us - after this deliverance and prophecy, what have been your experiences in your dreams?

0:06:35.580,0:06:38.360
Have you had such experiences repeat itself?

0:06:38.360,0:06:41.360
It's been dry. I don't feel anyone pushing me down anymore.

0:06:41.360,0:06:46.000
I felt like the Holy Spirit is lifting me up, that I am free completely.

0:06:46.000,0:06:51.320
One more time, let's put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!

0:06:51.320,0:06:54.340
What a miraculous wonderful testimony!

0:06:54.340,0:06:59.600
As the Prophet said during that prophecy, "As I say it now, it is finished".

0:06:59.600,0:07:03.700
Because indeed that word of prophecy contains both healing and deliverance.

0:07:03.700,0:07:07.140
It's a package that has both the question and answer.

0:07:07.140,0:07:09.600
We can see the evidence right now in the life of our sister.

0:07:09.600,0:07:13.120
Immediately after that prophetic message, she has not bedwetted again.

0:07:13.120,0:07:19.340
She is completely free from that terrible scourge of bedwetting right from her childhood.

0:07:19.340,0:07:23.480
Sister, what is your advice to people of God watching you right now?

0:07:23.480,0:07:28.580
My advice to everyone is to have hope. Never lose hope.

0:07:28.580,0:07:35.280
When you are facing a situation like this or any situation, it is not impossible with God.

0:07:35.280,0:07:40.620
He is not done with you. He is still continuing and has a plan for you.

0:07:40.620,0:07:42.020
Amen!

0:07:42.020,0:07:46.020
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:07:46.020,0:07:51.520
Glory be to God. Now we just want to quickly hear from the sister beside you as well.

0:07:51.520,0:07:56.700
Sister, you are welcome. Just tell us your name, and where you are from.

0:07:56.700,0:07:59.540
My name is Galina Straub. I am from the United States.

0:07:59.540,0:08:02.080
Who is this sister beside you? Who is she to you?

0:08:02.080,0:08:04.800
This is my daughter, Elysia Straub.

0:08:04.800,0:08:08.940
Tell us on your own side - what can you say about the problem she was having,

0:08:08.940,0:08:13.280
how it really affected the whole family.

0:08:13.280,0:08:16.880
We had a generational curse in my family.

0:08:16.880,0:08:27.660
It passed on to her. She had been bedwetting since she was a child.

0:08:27.660,0:08:34.400
We have been praying, fasting for her and taking her to doctors.

0:08:34.400,0:08:38.960
They said she should be able to grow out of it but she never did.

0:08:38.960,0:08:42.480
How did you feel each time you saw that she was bedwetting?

0:08:42.480,0:08:46.960
Even at her age, how did that make you feel as someone very close to her?

0:08:46.960,0:08:50.700
I felt the shame. I felt bad for her and felt bad for me.

0:08:50.700,0:08:54.360
Like what did I do wrong? Why is this on her?

0:08:54.360,0:08:59.140
Did I do something wrong or maybe I should do something about it?

0:08:59.140,0:09:03.500
We tried everything we could but we did not have any results.

0:09:03.500,0:09:07.320
You were here last week when Prophet T.B. Joshua gave her that word of prophecy.

0:09:07.320,0:09:11.860
How did you feel as the prophecy was given to her?

0:09:11.860,0:09:16.760
I almost cried because this was exactly what we came here for.

0:09:16.760,0:09:21.640
She was ashamed; she didn't want to write things out.

0:09:21.640,0:09:28.780
He said exactly the words that she didn't want anybody to know.

0:09:28.780,0:09:31.140
This is the truth.

0:09:31.140,0:09:35.180
The Prophet said exactly what she had.

0:09:35.180,0:09:39.220
After the prophecy came, I knew that God had a plan for us.

0:09:39.220,0:09:43.220
I believe that this curse will be broken.

0:09:43.220,0:09:47.960
Glory be to God Almighty. Since that word of prophecy and deliverance that came with it,

0:09:47.960,0:09:51.880
how has she been doing since then? How is her condition right now?

0:09:51.880,0:09:56.800
It has been great. I have been checking every day and night on her.

0:09:56.800,0:10:02.880
She's able to get up on her own to go to the bathroom.

0:10:02.880,0:10:05.980
She has been dry. I just want to thank God.

0:10:05.980,0:10:10.880
He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is still healing and delivering.

0:10:10.880,0:10:14.960
I just want to praise God for this church, and for Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:10:14.960,0:10:19.120
Thank you. Thank you so much. We really really appreciate it.

0:10:19.120,0:10:23.760
Let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!

0:10:23.760,0:10:28.600
Glory be to God. Indeed there are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus!".

0:10:28.600,0:10:34.000
Finally, what is your word of advice to viewers around the world watching you right now?

0:10:34.000,0:10:37.560
My advice is to believe and trust in God.

0:10:37.560,0:10:44.000
His word is the same yesterday and today. Whatever He promises, He does it.

0:10:44.000,0:10:47.040
You just have to look for it.

0:10:47.040,0:10:52.740
I know this church is a great church. We see the result.

0:10:52.740,0:10:56.980
Keep praying and keep believing.

0:10:56.980,0:11:06.320
Come here, use the Anointing Water, anything you can do to get your deliverance, to get your answer.

0:11:06.320,0:11:11.520
Amen. Thank You, Jesus. We want to encourage this family now that Jesus Christ has intervened in this case,

0:11:11.520,0:11:14.400
continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives.

0:11:14.400,0:11:18.660
We know the best is yet to come as you do so in Jesus' mighty name.

0:11:18.660,0:11:19.340
Amen.

0:11:19.340,0:11:25.240
