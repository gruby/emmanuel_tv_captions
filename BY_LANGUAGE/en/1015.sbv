0:00:00.000,0:00:07.840
When the heat of trial hits us, our real self surfaces.

0:00:07.840,0:00:09.960
Are you with me?

0:00:09.960,0:00:18.120
When the heat of trial hits us, our real self surfaces.

0:00:18.120,0:00:21.540
One can come to me and say, "This man is gently and very nice".

0:00:21.540,0:00:34.380
I would say, "Oh, he is nice? I want to see his track record, where he is coming from,

0:00:34.380,0:00:40.060
the battles he has fought."

0:00:40.060,0:00:52.660
When the heat of trial, temptation, affliction hits you, your real self surfaces.

0:00:52.660,0:00:55.100
Your real self surfaces.

0:00:55.100,0:01:02.900
"He is quiet, gentle, very humble; what a wonderful man." - I say, "Aha!"

0:01:02.900,0:01:09.120
"He is wonderful, quiet,  gentle; hmm."

0:01:09.120,0:01:13.240
Your real self surfaces...

0:01:13.240,0:01:22.260
Those things you keep to yourself; only you and God.

0:01:22.260,0:01:28.240
And people keep saying you are very nice, "What a wonderful, quiet man",

0:01:28.240,0:01:32.640
but many things you keep to yourself.

0:01:32.640,0:01:37.440
Only you and God; your Creator knows.

0:01:37.440,0:01:48.340
You keep hiding it, "Yes, sir... "

0:01:48.340,0:01:53.580
What are those things we keep to ourselves?

0:01:53.580,0:02:15.620
Those elements like jealousy, bitterness, anger, envy, resentment, hatred -

0:02:15.620,0:02:21.640
you have the ability to keep those things to yourself.

0:02:21.640,0:02:26.860
"I heard that you have been promoted to GM of the company; wonderful - congratulations",

0:02:26.860,0:02:33.680
whereas inside you is not a congratulation.

0:02:33.680,0:02:46.000
Inside you is, "Why not me? Why him? I know him. Why not me?"

0:02:46.000,0:02:51.060
These are the things we keep to ourselves.

0:02:51.060,0:03:03.140
When the heat of trial, temptation, hits us, our real self surfaces.

0:03:03.140,0:03:12.780
Each time I look at you – your appearance – I need to look at your heart.

0:03:12.780,0:03:18.340
Some say, "I'm a Christian. I've been doing good. I've been very nice to people."

0:03:18.340,0:03:29.940
The manner you forgive, restore and help, in the same manner you will be helped and forgiven.

0:03:29.940,0:03:35.100
So, you show that what you are doing to people is not from your heart.

0:03:35.100,0:03:43.500
The manner you help, forgive and restore another person,

0:03:43.500,0:03:50.100
in the same manner you will be restored, helped and forgiven.

0:03:50.100,0:04:00.060
Therefore, whatever you are doing, do it with all your heart.

0:04:00.060,0:04:08.860
Look at everyone here today; you are seated as if you really mean what you are here for.

0:04:08.860,0:04:13.200
How many of us actually need Jesus?

0:04:13.200,0:04:32.320
Oh how I love Jesus

0:04:32.320,0:04:38.160
Because He went for me

0:04:38.160,0:04:43.560
He went for us; because He is no longer on the cross.

0:04:43.560,0:04:46.300
You really love Jesus?

0:04:46.300,0:04:58.900
In good times you are saying, "I love Jesus in good times" but in hard time... - question mark.

0:04:58.900,0:05:02.380
You love Jesus?

0:05:02.380,0:05:12.280
In good times, when there is a testimony, money in the pocket, food on the table; you love Jesus,

0:05:12.280,0:05:19.080
but when there is no money in the pocket, no food on the table; question mark.

0:05:19.080,0:05:38.320
Oh how I love Jesus

0:05:38.320,0:05:46.020
Because He went for me

0:05:46.020,0:05:50.760
When there is no money in the pocket; question mark.

0:05:50.760,0:05:56.900
When there is money; you love Jesus - indeed.

0:05:56.900,0:06:01.420
You love Him.

0:06:01.420,0:06:15.520
When the heat of trial, disappointment, failure, sickness, disease, affliction, setback hits,

0:06:15.520,0:06:20.720
your real self surfaces.

0:06:20.720,0:06:30.140
"I do come to a church all the time. I pay my tithe. I have stopped smoking. I don't know why this happened to me.

0:06:30.140,0:06:38.140
Why all this; I don't know. Oh my God. Look at my friend; he never worships God or goes to church -

0:06:38.140,0:06:47.140
see him, he is fine. Oh my God." - you begin to see Jesus in the bad light.

0:06:47.140,0:06:54.040
When you see people dancing in the church; you can spot those who have testimonies today.

0:06:54.040,0:07:00.200
Some people do like this... - you know he has a testimony.

0:07:00.200,0:07:14.820
When some people are like this, "Inner my heart Lord..."...

0:07:14.820,0:07:19.580
Because your life is ruled by your blessing.

0:07:19.580,0:07:29.240
If there is blessing you are happy and if there is no blessing...

0:07:29.240,0:07:32.300
- Your life is ruled by your what?
- (Blessing.)

0:07:32.300,0:07:35.540
By your blessing.

0:07:35.540,0:07:40.000
OK, where is Jesus?

0:07:40.000,0:07:43.960
"Jesus - in good and hard times", tell your neighbour.

0:07:43.960,0:07:46.300
Where is Jesus?

0:07:46.300,0:07:51.600
Jesus – in good and hard times.

0:07:51.600,0:07:57.380
If you know Jesus in good times, you are a part-time Christian.

0:07:57.380,0:08:00.840
If you don't know Him in hard times, you are a part-time Christian.

0:08:00.840,0:08:08.140
Jesus is not looking for part-time but full-time Christians.

0:08:08.140,0:08:18.640
Tell your neighbour, "If you know Jesus in good times and not in hard times, you are a part-time Christian".

0:08:18.640,0:08:22.500
Jesus is not looking for part-time Christians but full-time Christians.

0:08:22.500,0:08:27.700
You must know Him in good and hard times alike.

0:08:27.700,0:08:32.800
The way you help, you are helped.

0:08:32.800,0:08:37.460
The way you greet, the Spirit of God also greets you.

0:08:37.460,0:08:43.040
The way you forgive, you would be forgiven.

0:08:43.040,0:08:50.940
The way you love your neighbour, the same way you are being loved by the Spirit of God.

0:08:50.940,0:08:59.140
Can you see; each time you receive you know it is a reward, because He is a Rewarder.

0:08:59.140,0:09:04.740
If you are giving what you do not need, you will continue to receive what you do not need.

0:09:04.740,0:09:12.460
If you give what your life depends on, you will receive what your life depends on from Jesus.

0:09:12.460,0:09:21.560
He has no farm, house or office; He is your neighbour, your brother.

0:09:21.560,0:09:29.500
Whatever you do to the little among you, that you do unto God.

0:09:29.500,0:09:32.220
What have you done to your neighbour today?

0:09:32.220,0:09:36.500
How many people have you blessed today?

0:09:36.500,0:09:40.280
... and you are coming to God for blessing.

0:09:40.280,0:09:46.800
You know; you come from somewhere - if you look right you see poor, if you look left you see poor,

0:09:46.800,0:09:49.700
at your back you see poor, at your front you see poor.

0:09:49.700,0:09:53.220
What have you done today to your neighbour?

0:09:53.220,0:09:58.940
Nothing, but you are waiting to receive from God.

0:09:58.940,0:10:01.380
In my local language we say:

0:10:01.380,0:10:03.880
Eni keni ti iwo be ni'pa
Whoever you have ability

0:10:03.880,0:10:07.200
Lati se iranlowo fun o
To assist

0:10:07.200,0:10:13.520
Oun na leni'keji re ranti re
He is your neighbour remember them

0:10:13.520,0:10:16.160
You must love your neighbour as yourself.

0:10:16.160,0:10:19.260
Your neighbour may not share the same faith with you.

0:10:19.260,0:10:29.980
Your neighbour may not be a Christian but love first.

0:10:29.980,0:10:33.460
Love first.

0:10:33.460,0:10:40.480
Your pain must be my pain and your joy must be my joy.

0:10:40.480,0:10:51.600
When you begin to see life in this manner, you are getting to the centre of your own world.

0:10:51.600,0:10:59.360
You are not blessed only because of your family but today people use that blessing only to their families.

0:10:59.360,0:11:06.520
You are blessed to bless others, including your family.

0:11:06.520,0:11:08.700
Amen?

0:11:08.700,0:11:13.320
Let me take you to the Book of John 8.

0:11:13.320,0:11:21.080
Inner my heart

0:11:21.080,0:11:23.520
What do you thing I'm trying to say?

0:11:23.520,0:11:26.080
When I sing, I'm talking.

0:11:26.080,0:11:31.820
I'm not a singer; you know I can compose, but I'm preaching, prophesying.

0:11:31.820,0:11:37.740
When I say, "Inner my heart" I say I need your heart.

0:11:37.740,0:11:55.960
If we confess in our heart, "Jesus is my Lord", immediately you confess in your heart,

0:11:55.960,0:12:04.000
here, Jesus comes in to bring you the balance.

0:12:04.000,0:12:11.260
You are able to say the truth, and to listen to me with all your heart.

0:12:11.260,0:12:16.420
Here Jesus comes in to bring the balance.

0:12:16.420,0:12:22.280
As you are sitting, you can begin to engage your heart:

0:12:22.280,0:12:27.480
Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.

0:12:27.480,0:12:30.040
Come into my heart.

0:12:30.040,0:12:32.560
Wash me with Your precious blood.

0:12:32.560,0:12:35.940
Save my soul today.

0:12:35.940,0:12:41.100
Your heart can be engaged while you are listening to me.

0:12:41.100,0:12:44.740
Are you engaging your heart?

0:12:44.740,0:12:47.280
Hallelujah!

0:12:47.280,0:12:48.420
Yes.

0:12:48.420,0:12:53.800
In that Book of John 8 I take verse 3 there - it says:

0:12:53.800,0:13:02.400
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.

0:13:02.400,0:13:06.500
They made her stand before the group

0:13:06.500,0:13:14.780
and said to Jesus, 'Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.

0:13:14.780,0:13:23.860
In the Law of Moses commanded us to stone such woman. Now what do you say?'"

0:13:23.860,0:13:26.240
This is the question to Jesus.

0:13:26.240,0:13:33.300
They knew what to do by their law of Moses but they came to Jesus,

0:13:33.300,0:13:36.680
in order to have something to trap Him.

0:13:36.680,0:13:46.280
"They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing Him."

0:13:46.280,0:13:51.240
They were looking for a way of accusing Him; what they can do - this is an opportunity for them.

0:13:51.240,0:13:59.960
"But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with His finger.

0:13:59.960,0:14:09.280
When they kept on questioning Him, He straightened up and said to them,

0:14:09.280,0:14:21.080
'Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her'."

0:14:21.080,0:14:24.720
Hallelujah, this is the question, this is what I'm saying here.

0:14:24.720,0:14:36.760
How can the kettle call the pot black – birds of the same feather -

0:14:36.760,0:14:44.680
when they are all one, used for cooking?

0:14:44.680,0:14:59.920
When you go by this, "Let any one who is without sin be the first"...

0:14:59.920,0:15:07.940
When we are offended, we feel hurt and blame the offender.

0:15:07.940,0:15:17.660
When we are offended, we feel hurt, embarrassed and blame our offender.

0:15:17.660,0:15:25.140
We always defend our bitterness, our anger.

0:15:25.140,0:15:36.300
We always defend our right – whether we are right or wrong – we are always there to defend

0:15:36.300,0:15:41.520
to justify our reason of doing what we are doing.

0:15:41.520,0:15:50.980
"This is a small boy, I trained him, I sent him to school; look at the insult he is passing to me."

0:15:50.980,0:15:58.860
This is you reason; inability to forgive - the reason why you won't forgive him.

0:15:58.860,0:16:05.180
"I trained him, I'm older than him..."

0:16:05.180,0:16:17.320
If that is the case, if by age, experiences in the world - I would not be the one to stand before you today -

0:16:17.320,0:16:23.420
we should look for someone else to come and address you.

0:16:23.420,0:16:34.400
... if by age and experiences out there, or by where we are coming from and what we have seen in life -

0:16:34.400,0:16:38.580
I should not be the one to stand here and address you.

0:16:38.580,0:16:58.180
We always defend our bitterness, anger and right to justify our reason or inability to forgive.

0:16:58.180,0:17:12.380
"Don't talk to me. You are living in a poor community. Do you know who I am? Please! No, he is illiterate"

0:17:12.380,0:17:31.680
It is at this point, Jesus advises us by saying, “How can the kettle call the pot black?”

0:17:31.680,0:17:36.360
How can the kettle call the pot black?

0:17:36.360,0:17:43.880
This means, "How can the kettle blame pot?"

0:17:43.880,0:17:45.740
How can you blame him?

0:17:45.740,0:17:54.160
How can anybody from over there come to blame anyone here, when you are birds of the same feather?

0:17:54.160,0:18:01.540
Remember your own weakness; you are not the right person to judge.

0:18:01.540,0:18:17.340
This is what Jesus referred to, when he bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.

0:18:17.340,0:18:28.900
As they kept on questioning Him, the Bible says He straightened up and said to them,

0:18:28.900,0:19:01.800
"Let anyone of you without envy, unforgiveness, anger, bitterness, jealousy, pride

0:19:01.800,0:19:19.120
hold offence, or continue to absorb; keep blaming your neighbour for offence he has done to him."

0:19:19.120,0:19:49.780
Tell your neighbour, "Let anyone of you without envy, jealousy, pride, unforgiveness hold offence".

0:19:49.780,0:19:58.460
When you take your Bible to the Book of Luke 23 and go straight to the verse 34:

0:19:58.460,0:20:09.480
“Jesus said, ‘Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing’.”

0:20:09.480,0:20:17.800
That statement alone - what we are saying here, "Father forgive them".

0:20:17.800,0:20:36.800
Take note of the word, ‘them’ because it includes both the offender and offended.

0:20:36.800,0:20:46.320
It includes both the offender and offended -

0:20:46.320,0:20:50.880
the wrong and the right.

0:20:50.880,0:21:01.040
This should be Christians’ standard of life: Father, forgive them.

0:21:01.040,0:21:13.740
The word 'them' - take note; the wrong and the right.

0:21:13.740,0:21:24.540
This is why Jesus said, when he bent down to write on the ground with His finger, He said to them,

0:21:24.540,0:21:31.140
"Let anyone of you without envy, jealousy...".

0:21:31.140,0:21:34.300
He simplified the sin mentioned there.

0:21:34.300,0:21:37.760
He said, "Let anyone of you without sin..."

0:21:37.760,0:21:39.700
You say, "Sin - what is sin?"

0:21:39.700,0:21:42.620
Many of you may not even understand that, "just sin".

0:21:42.620,0:21:45.200
This is what the Bible said there, "just sin".

0:21:45.200,0:21:57.780
But, "Let anyone of you without envy, jealousy, bitterness, pride..." - those things you keep to yourself.

0:21:57.780,0:22:03.900
Only when the heat of trial and temptation comes, "Don't talk to me like that! I will deal with you!"

0:22:03.900,0:22:07.740
You say, "He? This man can talk like this?"

0:22:07.740,0:22:15.620
You say somebody offended you, "The man offends me. He used to be my servant; he is a millionaire now.

0:22:15.620,0:22:22.800
I helped him. He was working under me. In fact; look at the way he addresses me - in what way."

0:22:22.800,0:22:35.260
We always defend our bitterness to justify our reason, "He is my boy. I trained him." - this is to defend.

0:22:35.260,0:22:37.700
That is the reason why you have to say that.

0:22:37.700,0:22:42.720
That is why, "Yes, I have to say that. I helped him. I gave him capital to start a business.

0:22:42.720,0:22:45.500
Now, whatever he becomes today, he should be very careful."

0:22:45.500,0:22:47.380
Oh?!

0:22:47.380,0:22:50.220
... because of the capital you gave him.

0:22:50.220,0:22:54.320
What of Jesus?

0:22:54.320,0:22:58.820
He has no sin but your sin.

0:22:58.820,0:23:00.900
"Father, forgive them."

0:23:00.900,0:23:07.660
Take note of the word, ‘them’.

0:23:07.660,0:23:13.660
It includes both the offender and what?

0:23:13.660,0:23:16.760
The offended.

0:23:16.760,0:23:29.780
Tell your neighbour, “Let anyone of you who is without envy, jealousy, bitterness, unforgiveness, pride

0:23:29.780,0:23:33.740
hold offence.”

0:23:33.740,0:23:38.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:38.120,0:23:44.820
This is a reason why you shouldn't hold offence, whether you are right or wrong,

0:23:44.820,0:23:56.380
unless you are without envy, jealousy, pride, unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, anger.

0:23:56.380,0:24:04.220
You are either a pot and your neighbour is a kettle, or you are a kettle and your neighbour is a pot;

0:24:04.220,0:24:13.360
birds of the same feather - pot and kettle used for cooking.

0:24:13.360,0:24:33.040
And I told you; the manner you forgive, restore, re-instate, greet, help, love another person,

0:24:33.040,0:24:41.840
you will be loved and forgiven by God.

0:24:41.840,0:24:44.560
By their fruit we shall know.

0:24:44.560,0:24:47.240
The manner you forgive, you will be forgiven.

0:24:47.240,0:24:50.980
Tell your neighbour.

0:24:50.980,0:24:56.700
The manner you forgive another person, you will be forgiven.

0:24:56.700,0:25:01.160
The manner you love another person, you will be loved.

0:25:01.160,0:25:08.460
The manner you restore your brother, you will be restored.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:11.840,0:25:16.540
You know; what you are doing nowadays is not from your heart.

0:25:16.540,0:25:18.580
Sometimes when I come you say, "Good morning, Sir".

0:25:18.580,0:25:21.700
I say, "Oh, well done".

0:25:21.700,0:25:27.060
When you say, "Good morning", I say, "Good morning" - while you go I will look at your back.

0:25:27.060,0:25:29.760
I will say, "Well done, sir."

0:25:29.760,0:25:31.880
Some people would say, "Why the man of God said, 'well done'?"

0:25:31.880,0:25:35.180
I'm greeting you, I know you.

0:25:35.180,0:25:47.120
You raise your brother's hand up saying, "Winner!", while your heart will say, "Why not me?".

0:25:47.120,0:25:56.640
"Winner!", they call you and you say, "Winner!" - your heart will be saying, "Why not you?".

0:25:56.640,0:26:06.960
You invest in the brother, you give him millions; by the time he lefts, you sit down and look at yourself and say,

0:26:06.960,0:26:16.820
"How will I know that this boy will appreciate what I have done now? How this boy would pay me back?"

0:26:16.820,0:26:20.240
Our heart...

0:26:20.240,0:26:23.820
Match your action with your words.

0:26:23.820,0:26:24.920
Tell your neighbour.

0:26:24.920,0:26:30.860
- (Match your action with your words.)
- I cannot hear you.

0:26:30.860,0:26:33.640
(Match your action with your words.)

0:26:33.640,0:26:37.760
If you are able to match your action with your word, it comes from your heart.

0:26:37.760,0:26:49.760
You say, "Be healed!", and I say "Be healed!" - my heart is telling me "Which kind of a healing?".

0:26:49.760,0:26:52.720
That has nullified "Be healed!"

0:26:52.720,0:26:54.520
And I say, "Check yourself".

0:26:54.520,0:27:00.300
Reply: "I still feel pain."

0:27:00.300,0:27:04.480
When I say "Be healed!", I know what is going on in my heart.

0:27:04.480,0:27:08.160
"Be free! Amen."

0:27:08.160,0:27:17.340
Your heart keeps telling you, "Who is free? You are in a bondage."

0:27:17.340,0:27:21.340
A lot of voices are in our heart.

0:27:21.340,0:27:25.280
Match your action with your words.

0:27:25.280,0:27:27.720
This is the problem we have today.

0:27:27.720,0:27:31.940
You don't mean what you are saying, and you never mean what you are doing.

0:27:31.940,0:27:32.660
If you really mean...

0:27:32.660,0:27:42.980
While you sit down, you receive a phone call and hear that business you have been looking for; billion of dollars

0:27:42.980,0:27:48.360
- the man is just at the corner of your home, and he wants to see you in two minutes at your home.

0:27:48.360,0:27:56.700
You look around, "Where is usher? I'm pressed."

0:27:56.700,0:28:01.880
There is a language for every negative action.

0:28:01.880,0:28:08.200
Because you want to leave, you learn how to lie, "I'm pressed", and you are not pressed.

0:28:08.200,0:28:12.260
By the time you get there you say, "I'm looking for a restroom."

0:28:12.260,0:28:14.200
"OK, there is one there."

0:28:14.200,0:28:19.880
By the time you get to the restroom, you call your business partner back.

0:28:19.880,0:28:26.260
You know; that place is good for calling, "Hello. What are you telling me?"

0:28:26.260,0:28:35.840
"I say that in two minutes I will get to your house. If I don't see you, I'm leaving the country."

0:28:35.840,0:28:36.740
You hide your handset.

0:28:36.740,0:28:41.740
You will now plan what to say, so that they would open the gate for you.

0:28:41.740,0:28:51.300
You begin to plan, "What will I say now? I need to take something from the vehicle, it is very serious."

0:28:51.300,0:28:55.820
Because your coming here is not from your heart.

0:28:55.820,0:28:59.720
We have not been doing things from our heart.

0:28:59.720,0:29:03.780
And faith is of man’s heart.

0:29:03.780,0:29:08.900
Whatever that does not come from your heart is sin.

0:29:08.900,0:29:18.480
You can never see things clearly if your action is not from your heart.

0:29:18.480,0:29:27.300
Seeing things clearly can make us see beyond our present situation.

0:29:27.300,0:29:29.680
"This is disappointment."

0:29:29.680,0:29:43.140
But you don't know that that disappointment is meant to preserve you, prepare you,

0:29:43.140,0:29:47.200
strengthen your desire and determination for God.

0:29:47.200,0:29:55.060
It is meant to stop you for a while and re-arrange your future.

0:29:55.060,0:30:00.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:00.880,0:30:08.620
If your actions don't come from your heart, you cannot see things clearly.

0:30:08.620,0:30:12.180
You always see things on the surface.

0:30:12.180,0:30:17.300
What we are seeing now - if your coming here is not from your heart, we will only see,

0:30:17.300,0:30:29.460
"This man has a white beard. Is it dyed? What has happened? Look at him. He looks like my brother,

0:30:29.460,0:30:36.720
or my driver - just the same size. The man must be around fifty years of age.

0:30:36.720,0:30:48.400
He just wants to celebrate his birthday. Look at him; he is going to another direction. He will come back again.

0:30:48.400,0:30:55.140
What are those fruits? Can they give me one? I cannot get it."

0:30:55.140,0:30:58.480
Your heart will be jumping up and down.

0:30:58.480,0:31:04.280
Your heart will judge...; you will continue to be busy with your heart.

0:31:04.280,0:31:07.640
The heart that is busy cannot focus.

0:31:07.640,0:31:15.460
Oh my God; take that word.

0:31:15.460,0:31:19.320
Look at me; I am going this direction and something keeps telling me

0:31:19.320,0:31:21.720
that somebody is waiting for me at home.

0:31:21.720,0:31:24.660
The person - I don't know...

0:31:24.660,0:31:31.460
This is where I'm going to see somebody, but the heart keeps telling me, "Somebody is waiting for me at home

0:31:31.460,0:31:38.340
and I don't know whether I'll get there. I don't know if I meet the man at the office.

0:31:38.340,0:31:42.940
Last time he disappointed me. I don't know if he would disappoint me."

0:31:42.940,0:31:48.220
The heart keeps being busy; definitely you will lose focus.

0:31:48.220,0:31:51.260
You will probably not get here.

0:31:51.260,0:31:56.680
"Your heart is too busy." - tell your neighbour.

0:31:56.680,0:32:01.340
This is confusion in which we find ourselves.

0:32:01.340,0:32:08.740
Seeing clearly helps to see beyond our present situation.

0:32:08.740,0:32:16.300
... to preserve you, to prepare you, to strengthen your desire and determination, to stop you for a while

0:32:16.300,0:32:25.260
and re-arrange your future - this is your present situation, but you don't know, you just don't want it,

0:32:25.260,0:32:29.240
you do everything to remove it on your own.

0:32:29.240,0:32:38.000
The one that is waiting to re-arrange your future will say, "The man has gone; he didn't wait for me to arrange it.

0:32:38.000,0:32:43.980
I had to hold him to arrange his future before he moves. He has gone."

0:32:43.980,0:32:48.580
This is for you.

0:32:48.580,0:32:50.600
This is Jesus for you.

0:32:50.600,0:33:01.380
He asked the man at the pool of Bethesda, "What can I do for you? You want Me to pray for you?"

0:33:01.380,0:33:04.940
He didn't just grab the man and started praying, "I want to deliver you!" - no.

0:33:04.940,0:33:06.620
He needs your faith.

0:33:06.620,0:33:09.360
He needs your genuine willingness.

0:33:09.360,0:33:15.100
Our genuine willingness plus God’s ability work miracle.

0:33:15.100,0:33:27.940
If you are not and not ready to be genuine, no matter the power... - there is nothing.

0:33:27.940,0:33:34.720
He says, "I will make you fishers of men", if you what?

0:33:34.720,0:33:35.940
If you follow!

0:33:35.940,0:33:39.200
If you don't follow, He cannot make you to.

0:33:39.200,0:33:40.580
You have a role to play.

0:33:40.580,0:33:46.700
He says, “I will make you fishers of men

0:33:46.700,0:33:52.400
Fishers of men

0:33:52.400,0:33:57.640
I will make you fishers of men

0:33:57.640,0:34:00.820
If you follow Me"

0:34:00.820,0:34:07.420
That is the condition.

0:34:07.420,0:34:13.760
It is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to us.

0:34:13.760,0:34:17.840
It’s not all up to you; certainly, it is not all up to God.

0:34:17.840,0:34:21.880
Your genuine willingness and God’s ability work out things.

0:34:21.880,0:34:24.300
"If you follow Me"

0:34:24.300,0:34:29.400
If you don't follow Him...

0:34:29.400,0:34:37.000
The title: "How can the kettle blame pot?"

0:34:37.000,0:34:39.920
Tell your neighbour.

0:34:39.920,0:34:43.700
Again.

0:34:43.700,0:34:49.120
You may be the kettle, your neighbour may be the pot -

0:34:49.120,0:34:53.480
birds of the same feather, used for cooking.

0:34:53.480,0:34:56.140
The way out:

0:34:56.140,0:35:09.740
if you are without envy, jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, hurt, anger,

0:35:09.740,0:35:13.780
you can hold offence.

0:35:13.780,0:35:21.420
I’m very sure, here in this world, before you can see anyone without envy,

0:35:21.420,0:35:30.800
jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, anger, hurt, you will go to Heaven.

0:35:30.800,0:35:36.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:36.540,0:35:44.320
That is why we should not hold offence, including me.

0:35:44.320,0:35:52.160
Holding offence is evidence that you are without any of these.

0:35:52.160,0:35:57.500
Let me pray with you, so that this message can have a place in your heart.

0:35:57.500,0:36:01.100
I pray this message finds a place in your heart.

0:36:01.100,0:36:03.200
(Amen.)

0:36:03.200,0:36:07.340
Say, “Find a place in my heart.”

0:36:07.340,0:36:08.420
I cannot hear you.

0:36:08.420,0:36:10.160
(Find a place in my heart.)

0:36:10.160,0:36:11.360
I cannot hear you.

0:36:11.360,0:36:12.760
(Find a place in my heart.)

0:36:12.760,0:36:14.060
I cannot hear you.

0:36:14.060,0:36:15.200
(Find a place in my heart.)

0:36:15.200,0:36:16.460
I cannot hear you.

0:36:16.460,0:36:17.980
(Find a place in my heart.)

0:36:17.980,0:36:19.180
I cannot hear you.

0:36:19.180,0:36:21.080
(Find a place in my heart.)

0:36:21.080,0:36:24.560
Because it is a very serious issue.

0:36:24.560,0:36:36.940
The world is like this because of offence.

0:36:36.940,0:36:41.220
Your life is like this because of offence.

0:36:41.220,0:36:48.240
You can never have a way out, without stopping to hold offence.

0:36:48.240,0:36:53.420
No way out; I'm telling you.

0:36:53.420,0:37:02.760
Because if you get deliverance now, and you get delivered, and you see your offender,

0:37:02.760,0:37:06.080
you will lose your deliverance.

0:37:06.080,0:37:08.620
Immediately, you will lose your blessing.

0:37:08.620,0:37:20.500
"Ah, this is a man I don't want to see. This is this woman. I will not take this call; this is a foolish man."

0:37:20.500,0:37:24.100
You are losing your blessing.

0:37:24.100,0:37:33.520
You will receive your deliverance, blessing, healing but to maintain this healing, stop holding offence.

0:37:33.520,0:37:34.680
Tell your neighbour.

0:37:34.680,0:37:40.200
You will receive healing, deliverance, blessing.

0:37:40.200,0:37:46.680
To maintain these blessing, stop holding offence.

0:37:46.680,0:37:53.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:53.220,0:37:57.260
The God that says, “Thou shall not lie” says, “Thou shall not kill” - the same God.

0:37:57.260,0:38:01.500
If you have lied, you have killed.

0:38:01.500,0:38:07.700
Why are you holding offence any longer?

0:38:07.700,0:38:17.580
Because you are without envy, unforgiveness, bitterness, hurt, anger;

0:38:17.580,0:38:21.320
that is why you are holding offence.

0:38:21.320,0:38:25.220
Can that be?

0:38:25.220,0:38:38.600
I pray this message finds a place in your heart,

0:38:38.600,0:38:41.140
in Jesus Christ’s name.

0:38:41.140,0:38:43.480
Thank You, Jesus.

0:38:43.480,0:38:46.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:38:46.740,0:38:49.980
You may be seated.

0:38:49.980,0:38:52.800
I'm free.

0:38:52.800,0:38:55.660
If you are free too, let me see your hand.

0:38:55.660,0:38:58.940
If the Spirit of God has touched you...

0:38:58.940,0:39:06.040
And you can begin to give a call; people you need to call - any opportunity you have,

0:39:06.040,0:39:11.520
- "I just want to say hi, I'm so so so..."
- "You call me?"

0:39:11.520,0:39:20.680
- "Yes, I call you. I've been praying for you. I love you so much..."

0:39:20.680,0:39:24.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:39:24.320,0:39:27.060
Send this message to you leaders.

0:39:27.060,0:39:32.940
If you have an opportunity to have a meeting  with you leaders, please tell them,

0:39:32.940,0:39:46.860
“Holding offence is like committing a crime because unforgiveness imprisons us.

0:39:46.860,0:39:49.020
It puts us in the prison, cage."

0:39:49.020,0:39:55.920
You just find that there is a limit on what you can do.

0:39:55.920,0:39:57.700
I can't do this - there is a limit.

0:39:57.700,0:40:00.640
It puts us in the prison.

0:40:00.640,0:40:04.780
And what is not done well is not done at all.

0:40:04.780,0:40:10.440
Unforgiveness is too dangerous for your future.

0:40:10.440,0:40:14.080
Don’t pretend to forgive; don’t pretend to love.

0:40:14.080,0:40:20.560
Like I have said, the manner you love is the manner you will be loved.

0:40:20.560,0:40:24.520
The manner you forgive is the manner you will be forgiven.

0:40:24.520,0:40:27.160
Whatever you want to do, let it come from your heart.

0:40:27.160,0:40:30.900
God is the Rewarder.

0:40:30.900,0:40:37.880
If you continue to blame others, you will never repent.

0:40:37.880,0:40:46.000
"Ah yes, he is very rude to me" - you will never repent.

0:40:46.000,0:40:50.300
Accept everything, "Yes, this is wrong. OK. I know I'm the one."

0:40:50.300,0:40:58.680
Because we are not fighting the flesh and blood; blaming others you will never repent.

0:40:58.680,0:41:03.600
God often uses anything.

0:41:03.600,0:41:09.800
You might be sitting, somebody would just come and start beating you.

0:41:09.800,0:41:12.040
"Ah, what have I done?"

0:41:12.040,0:41:15.520
Remember you are a Christian - you better run, leave the place.

0:41:15.520,0:41:20.280
Don't retaliate because you don't know why this has happened.

0:41:20.280,0:41:25.740
Everything, "Why God?"...

0:41:25.740,0:41:30.660
God often uses anything - think about that.

0:41:30.660,0:41:33.880
What is anything?

0:41:33.880,0:41:40.760
So many things have been used in the past to prepare you but you failed.

0:41:40.760,0:41:43.300
I can give you some good examples.

0:41:43.300,0:41:48.980
Position of some of you was overtaken by "fire".

0:41:48.980,0:41:57.640
You were in a position, and your junior was promoted to be your head, your boss.

0:41:57.640,0:42:05.240
You now say, "Eh? I serve God. I fast and pray. I'm always in the church. How can my junior,

0:42:05.240,0:42:16.280
whom I gave instructions, can be promoted to be my boss? Oh no; by fire."

0:42:16.280,0:42:18.300
You run to a witch-doctor.

0:42:18.300,0:42:25.780
You say, "This one is my junior - he was promoted and is my boss now. He is the one giving me instructions."

0:42:25.780,0:42:28.540
The witch-doctor will say, "What do you want me to do?"

0:42:28.540,0:42:31.760
"By fire, by fire."

0:42:31.760,0:42:33.660
You are given a powder.

0:42:33.660,0:42:38.720
Since he now became your boss, you have to clean the table for him - you drop the powder there.

0:42:38.720,0:42:43.620
That is the end.

0:42:43.620,0:42:50.240
One month, two months - you take over the position.

0:42:50.240,0:42:56.660
You don't know that...

0:42:56.660,0:43:04.760
Look, it is too early to say that the man is blessed.

0:43:04.760,0:43:09.120
The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:43:15.620,0:43:17.480
These are the lessons we should learn.

0:43:17.480,0:43:28.580
Many heroes collapsed; great men, the rich, the wealthy...

0:43:28.580,0:43:32.160
The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.

0:43:32.160,0:43:43.520
If you don’t finish well, everything you lived for is gone and the history about you is erased.

0:43:43.520,0:43:50.240
The evil that men do lives after them.

0:43:50.240,0:43:58.620
Many of you have been prepared for a generation yet unborn, just like apostles -

0:43:58.620,0:44:04.460
they were prepared for the generation yet unborn, so that when they die,

0:44:04.460,0:44:08.680
their work will live for the generation yet unborn.

0:44:08.680,0:44:12.540
This is what we are seeing now.

0:44:12.540,0:44:19.520
Your exit; anytime you behave remember your exit.

0:44:19.520,0:44:30.240
Always think about where your thought, attitude, behaviour will be credited to your account.

0:44:30.240,0:44:35.040
Our account is in our future, not now.

0:44:35.040,0:44:38.300
You are living, working now.

0:44:38.300,0:44:44.160
What we are doing now will be credited to our future.

0:44:44.160,0:44:46.780
What are you doing now that will be credited to your future?

0:44:46.780,0:44:51.540
If you are doing evil now, that evil will be credited to your future.

0:44:51.540,0:44:53.120
Are you doing good now?

0:44:53.120,0:44:56.520
The good you are doing now will be credited to your future -

0:44:56.520,0:45:04.840
you will find them in the future, where that physical strength is no longer there.

0:45:04.840,0:45:10.320
Let us remember our future.

0:45:10.320,0:45:17.320
My future is my life.

0:45:17.320,0:45:21.360
That is life.

0:45:21.360,0:45:30.360
Let me suffer now and enjoy in the future.

0:45:30.360,0:45:35.660
But enjoying now and suffering in future - that is...

0:45:35.660,0:45:45.940
How many of us; but we are not ready to suffer now and enjoy in future.

0:45:45.940,0:45:55.520
So, what you are going through - and you are running for to the witch-doctor, try to cut the journey -

0:45:55.520,0:45:58.220
which is to prepare you for the future.

0:45:58.220,0:45:59.920
This is what I have said.

0:45:59.920,0:46:09.720
God often uses anything to preserve, prepare, strengthen our desire and determination,

0:46:09.720,0:46:14.460
to stop us for a while and arrange our future.

0:46:14.460,0:46:21.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:46:21.420,0:46:24.220
He is arranging your future.

0:46:24.220,0:46:31.300
Anything can be used to arrange your future; sickness, disappointment.

0:46:31.300,0:46:38.200
Those things will come but you need those experiences.
