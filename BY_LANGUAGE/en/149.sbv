STANDARD FOR LIFE

Here are Mr and Mrs Hans Baksteen -

0:00:06.260,0:00:12.120
visitors from Holland who are here in The 
Synagogue Church Of All Nations in Lagos Nigeria,

0:00:12.120,0:00:15.600
seeking for the fruit of the womb 
from God Almighty.

0:00:15.600,0:00:34.880
Mr & Mrs Baksteen

0:00:34.880,0:00:38.720
This is a document from the Minister of Justice in Holland

0:00:38.720,0:00:42.060
registering their application for adoption of a child.

0:00:42.060,0:00:47.400
This proves they have given up all hope of having their own child.

0:00:47.400,0:00:53.520
But today, they are returning to Jesus Christ, the Giver of life.

0:00:53.520,0:00:57.240
You are welcome to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, in Jesus' name.

0:00:57.240,0:01:00.400
Tell us your name and the country you come from.

0:01:00.400,0:01:05.540
My name is Josein Baksteen, I'm 31 years old and I'm from Holland.

0:01:05.540,0:01:08.760
Who is the man sitting next to you?

0:01:08.760,0:01:11.180
The man sitting next to me is my husband.

0:01:11.180,0:01:13.140
And the problem that brought me to the Synagogue

0:01:13.140,0:01:15.880
is the problem of looking for the fruit of the womb.

0:01:15.880,0:01:21.060
I went twice through some surgery and
 they did some research.

0:01:21.060,0:01:28.480
They found out that there was a problem but were unable to specify what the problem was.

0:01:28.480,0:01:31.440
There was a problem which did not allow me to conceive.

0:01:31.440,0:01:34.140
My husband is having a problem of low sperm count.

0:01:34.140,0:01:41.120
That is why the combination of our problems makes it very difficult for us to have a baby.

0:01:41.120,0:01:45.860
This is my second visit and on the first visit, I discussed it with the prophet.

0:01:45.860,0:01:51.920
I told him that we were in the process of adopting, which had taken three years.

0:01:51.920,0:01:55.640
He advised me not to continue with the adoption and to bring my husband,

0:01:55.640,0:01:57.240
that we would have our own baby.

0:01:57.240,0:01:59.300
Let's hear from your husband.

0:01:59.300,0:02:01.300
My name is Hans Baksteen.

0:02:01.300,0:02:03.840
The woman beside me is my wife.

0:02:03.840,0:02:09.140
I'm in The SCOAN today because we are in need of the fruit of the womb.

0:02:09.140,0:02:17.140
My wife went to several hospitals and had some surgeries

0:02:17.140,0:02:23.080
in an attempt to fall pregnant but found no solution.

0:02:23.080,0:02:27.140
When we found out that there was no medical solution,

0:02:27.140,0:02:31.880
then we started the process of adoption.

0:02:31.880,0:02:40.200
Here you can see the permission given to adopt a baby from the Ministry of Justice.

0:02:40.200,0:02:46.360
It is an official permit to adopt a baby from another country.

0:02:46.360,0:02:49.900
We were intending to adopt a child from Ethiopia.

0:02:49.900,0:02:52.400
Is this why you came here today?

0:02:52.400,0:02:59.700
This is why I'm here because I believe that God is able to solve this problem for us

0:02:59.700,0:03:01.720
and that He can give us a baby.

0:03:01.720,0:03:06.560
HEALING TIME

0:03:06.560,0:03:11.300
This is the emergency section of The SCOAN

0:03:11.300,0:03:14.040
where visitors from all over the world have come

0:03:14.040,0:03:18.160
to receive a touch from our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ

0:03:18.160,0:03:21.720
through His able servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:03:21.720,0:03:24.640
Among them are Mr and Mrs Baksteen.

0:03:24.640,0:03:28.000
Be healed, in Jesus' name.

0:03:28.000,0:03:30.780
Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua stretching forth this hand

0:03:30.780,0:03:33.920
to command out everything that is not of Jesus,

0:03:33.920,0:03:36.660
and to replace it with what is of Jesus.

0:03:36.660,0:03:41.600
It is God's desire for everyone to be restored to full and abundant life.

0:03:41.600,0:03:46.940
Jesus Christ is now shaking the obstacle of the problem they have faced for so long.

0:03:46.940,0:03:53.740
Lord I believe
In Your holy name

0:03:53.740,0:03:57.140
You are free today, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:03:57.140,0:03:59.680
Time with Jesus is time with joy

0:03:59.680,0:04:04.560
as Prophet T.B. Joshua assures them that their blessing is not far from them.

0:04:04.560,0:04:07.740
They now have something to shout "Hallelujah!" about.

0:04:07.740,0:04:13.720
A few months later, Mr and Mrs Baksteen came back to The SCOAN

0:04:13.720,0:04:17.840
to testify that Mrs Baksteen is now pregnant.

0:04:17.840,0:04:19.660
To God be the Glory!

0:04:19.660,0:04:26.800
TESTIMONY TIME

0:04:26.800,0:04:30.340
Jesus Christ says what He means and He means what He says.

0:04:30.340,0:04:33.540
When He says you are blessed, you are blessed indeed.

0:04:33.540,0:04:37.780
Hans and Josein have come singing and dancing back into The Synagogue,

0:04:37.780,0:04:40.500
showing the blessing of God in their lives.

0:04:40.500,0:04:46.460
Our names are Mr and Mrs Hans and Josein Baksteen.

0:04:46.460,0:04:52.060
We are from Holland and the problem that brought us to The SCOAN

0:04:52.060,0:04:55.640
was low sperm count and fruit of the womb.

0:04:55.640,0:05:05.280
We came to Nigeria and last March Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for us.

0:05:05.280,0:05:09.660
Then we went back to Holland and we met as husband and wife.

0:05:09.660,0:05:12.140
And after that my wife became pregnant

0:05:12.140,0:05:15.580
Now, you can see her - she is seven and a half months pregnant.

0:05:15.580,0:05:19.980
Praise the Lord for that!

0:05:19.980,0:05:25.400
Our advice to all people who are looking for the fruit of the womb is:

0:05:25.400,0:05:31.120
Trust in the Lord and be patient and what He did for us, He can also do for you.

0:05:31.120,0:05:32.780
Praise the Lord!

0:05:32.780,0:05:37.140
My name is Josein Baksteen.
I'm all the way from Holland.

0:05:37.140,0:05:39.840
And as you can see I'm pregnant now.

0:05:39.840,0:05:43.200
Here I am standing in front of you for the glory of God,

0:05:43.200,0:05:45.880
telling you that I'm pregnant and I'm very very happy.

0:05:45.880,0:05:50.680
Testimony Time

0:05:50.680,0:05:57.260
A few months later, Mr And Mrs Hans Baksteen came back to The SCOAN

0:05:57.260,0:06:02.380
with their bouncing baby to testify to the goodness of God in their lives.

0:06:02.380,0:06:20.400
Mr & Mrs Baksteen Arriving At The SCOAN With Their Baby

0:06:20.400,0:06:26.100
Mr and Mrs Baksteen are back to The SCOAN with their child

0:06:26.100,0:06:29.400
which is definitely something to be happy about.

0:06:29.400,0:06:33.420
Glory be to God, they have received from Jesus Christ.

0:06:33.420,0:06:38.400
Mr & Mrs Baksteen Arriving At The SCOAN With Their Baby

0:06:38.400,0:06:42.920
Mr and Mrs Hans Baksteen, the blessed parents, are now walking

0:06:42.920,0:06:46.460
in the midst of the people of God with their newborn baby

0:06:46.460,0:06:52.440
to testify that God knows every need you face and He is ready to supply them.

0:06:52.440,0:06:54.280
So, just believe!

0:06:54.280,0:07:00.000
Mr & Mrs Baksteen
Enter The SCOAN Rejoicing

0:07:00.000,0:07:13.200
They Sit In The Midst Of Other Mothers Blessed With Miracle Babies

0:07:13.200,0:07:16.860
My name is Josein Baksteen.
I'm from Holland.

0:07:16.860,0:07:23.860
My baby's name is Promise Baksteen.

0:07:23.860,0:07:27.800
The man sitting next to me is my husband Hans Baksteen.

0:07:27.800,0:07:34.620
When I came to The SCOAN, I was very surprised seeing all these miracle babies.

0:07:34.620,0:07:38.920
I wasn't even thinking about having another baby anymore

0:07:38.920,0:07:42.360
because we had waited for such a long time.

0:07:42.360,0:07:47.440
I became very happy because I thought if God can do this for these people,

0:07:47.440,0:07:49.460
He can surely do it for us.

0:07:49.460,0:07:54.080
We were in the process of adopting a baby which is a very long process.

0:07:54.080,0:07:59.840
It takes five years to adopt a baby and we were in this process for three years.

0:07:59.840,0:08:02.660
We had all the official papers ready.

0:08:02.660,0:08:09.960
The Prophet prayed over the problems of fruit of the womb and low sperm count.

0:08:09.960,0:08:12.660
He prayed over our problems and we went back home.

0:08:12.660,0:08:17.060
We met as husband and wife and after a while, I became pregnant.

0:08:17.060,0:08:20.340
Praise the Lord!

0:08:20.340,0:08:27.060
While I was seven months pregnant, I visited The SCOAN.

0:08:27.060,0:08:32.340
The prophet said, "You will deliver a baby girl and her name will be Promise."

0:08:32.340,0:08:35.380
That was a real promise of God.

0:08:35.380,0:08:40.240
As you can see, we have a bouncing baby girl.

0:08:40.240,0:08:43.800
Her name is Promise, and we are very very happy.

0:08:43.800,0:08:46.580
Praise the Lord!

0:08:46.580,0:08:49.340
We thank the Lord for what He has done in our lives.

0:08:49.340,0:08:52.660
He is good, He is so good.

0:08:52.660,0:08:54.680
My name is Hans Baksteen.

0:08:54.680,0:08:59.620
I'm the husband of Josein who is sitting beside me.

0:08:59.620,0:09:04.500
The name of the baby is Promise Joy Illeri Oluwa.

0:09:04.500,0:09:09.900
Mr & Mrs Baksteen With Their Baby Promise

0:09:09.900,0:09:12.420
Her name means "Promise of God".

0:09:12.420,0:09:16.540
The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was the problem of barrenness.

0:09:16.540,0:09:19.900
The problem on my part was low sperm count.

0:09:19.900,0:09:26.320
Last year March, I was invited to come with my wife to The SCOAN.

0:09:26.320,0:09:31.200
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed over our problems.

0:09:31.200,0:09:38.440
After that, we went home and met as husband and wife.

0:09:38.440,0:09:41.380
My wife got pregnant.

0:09:41.380,0:09:48.980
After nine months, she delivered a beautiful bouncing
 baby girl named Promise of God.

0:09:48.980,0:09:52.240
We thank God for what He has done in our lives.

0:09:52.240,0:09:57.280
Our advice to couples who are also looking for the fruit of the womb

0:09:57.280,0:10:04.300
is to trust God because He can also do for you what He has done for us.

0:10:04.300,0:10:09.380
Mr & Mrs Baksteen With Their Baby Promise

Baby Promise Crawling At The SCOAN

0:10:20.860,0:10:24.500
Baby Promise, Now Walking,

0:10:24.500,0:10:26.560
This is Promise Baksteen.

0:10:26.560,0:10:29.940
She's growing stronger day by day and is now walking.

0:10:29.940,0:10:34.660
Promise is very happy to be back in The SCOAN today.

0:10:34.660,0:10:38.440
She has come with her parents to give God all the glory.

0:10:38.440,0:10:43.400
Baby Promise, Now Walking,
Returns To The SCOAN
