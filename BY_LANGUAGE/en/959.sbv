We went to The SCOAN four years ago; we saw the glory of God

0:04:10.280,0:04:14.120
and we have a lot of expectations because we know where Prophet T.B. Joshua steps,

0:04:14.120,0:04:19.700
there is a change; the kingdom of God comes to the nation in healing, deliverance and prophecy.

0:04:19.700,0:04:24.580
We are very excited about what God is going to do in this nation which is why we flew so many

0:04:24.580,0:04:27.220
Kilometres to share in what God is about to do through Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:04:27.220,0:04:33.220
We know that thousands of people are going to be healed and delivered in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:04:33.220,0:04:37.280
We have great expectations. Four years ago we were in SCOAN and we came

0:04:37.280,0:04:40.840
here from Spain, because we know wherever prophet T.B Joshua arrives

0:04:40.840,0:04:46.440
there is healing, there is deliverance, there is prophecy and there is great

0:04:46.440,0:04:49.640
change and great healing for that nation. So that is why we took all

0:04:49.640,0:04:55.800
those miles to be able to be here and spend this time and be part of this with

0:04:55.800,0:04:57.200
Prophet T.B Joshua.
