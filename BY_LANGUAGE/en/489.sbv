0:00:00.380,0:00:05.740
Open your lips, and ask for the mercy of God for yourself.

0:00:05.740,0:00:09.100
You need the mercy of God to speak for you.

0:00:09.100,0:00:11.340
His mercy is enough.

0:00:11.340,0:00:13.020
His favour.

0:00:13.020,0:00:17.700
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

0:00:17.700,0:00:18.440
Prayer!

0:00:18.440,0:00:30.140
Viewers at home, ask for the mercy of God, the favour of God.

The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:00:34.820,0:00:38.280
In Jesus Chist' name we pray.

0:00:38.300,0:00:47.560
When you take note of people
before you in your family,

0:00:47.560,0:00:55.460
you will notice that they had been aspiring for certain positions.

0:00:55.460,0:00:58.900
But they could not get it.

0:00:58.900,0:01:06.480
This shows that there is a limitation in the family.

0:01:06.480,0:01:11.640
Not only you, but people before you.

0:01:11.640,0:01:18.200
It has been their desire to get to certain positions;
it has been very difficult.

0:01:18.200,0:01:26.320
No way because there is a limitation in the family that needs to be broken.

0:01:26.320,0:01:33.160
As for me, each time I sit down, I say, "Wow!"

0:01:33.160,0:01:38.000
What a grace God has given to me to break this limitation.

0:01:38.000,0:01:41.700
You - you need to break your own.

0:01:41.700,0:01:46.180
I smile; I say I have broken this limitation.

0:01:46.180,0:01:50.040
The cycle of limitation.

0:01:50.040,0:01:53.880
We are not only talking of position this time;

0:01:53.880,0:01:58.360
we are talking about position and peace.

0:01:58.360,0:02:05.460
Position needs peace; position needs comfort.

0:02:05.460,0:02:09.960
Position minus peace is not position.

0:02:09.960,0:02:14.060
You need peace and comfort.

0:02:14.060,0:02:24.900
Open your lips and begin to break that cycle of life; that limitation in the family - break it!

0:02:24.900,0:02:30.720
I will join you in faith to break that limitation.

0:02:30.720,0:02:52.980

0:02:52.980,0:02:57.740
In the mighty name of Jesus!

0:02:57.740,0:03:06.200
Cycle of limitation - be broken.

0:03:06.200,0:03:15.280
Right now, begin to release yourself!
Release your family from that sickness!

0:03:15.280,0:03:22.660
From disease, from limitation.
Begin to release your family.

0:03:22.660,0:03:27.860
Release your family.

0:03:27.860,0:03:30.660
I release my family.

0:03:30.660,0:03:33.520
I release myself.

0:03:33.520,0:03:37.540
I release!

In the mighty name of Jesus!

0:03:54.780,0:03:57.740
Yes, we are moving forward.

0:03:57.740,0:04:00.440
Many of us, we do not know how to pray.

0:04:00.440,0:04:06.960
When you ask God for bread. Immediately you say, "God, give me bread".

0:04:06.960,0:04:10.540
Immediately say, "Thank You for giving me bread".

0:04:10.540,0:04:13.560
Then you come back again - "Give me bread, give me bread.

0:04:13.560,0:04:15.340
Thank You for giving me bread.

0:04:15.340,0:04:16.980
Give me bread...give me bread...give me bread.

0:04:16.980,0:04:20.340
Thank You for giving me bread. Thank You for giving me bread".

0:04:20.340,0:04:25.680
These two things must go together. Ask and Thank You.

0:04:25.680,0:04:30.620
But you will not say, "Thank You", because you want to receive before you say thank you.

0:04:30.620,0:04:33.660
This has been robbing you of your blessings.

0:04:33.660,0:04:42.980
"Heal me, Lord. Heal me, Lord. Thank You for healing me."

0:04:42.980,0:04:45.880
"Deliver me, Lord. Deliver me, Lord.
Thank You for delivering me."

0:04:45.880,0:04:47.660
That is how to pray.

0:04:47.660,0:04:50.200
Thanks must follow your request.

0:04:50.200,0:04:53.380
Pari passu.

0:04:53.380,0:04:55.360
Synonymous.

0:04:55.360,0:04:58.060
Not: "Heal me...heal me...heal me".

0:04:58.060,0:05:01.600
You won't say thank you until the pain disappears.

0:05:01.600,0:05:03.300
He is the Healer.

0:05:03.300,0:05:07.440
He can heal you. Even if He has not healed you. He can heal you.

0:05:07.440,0:05:10.480
He is what He says He is. He is the Healer.

0:05:10.480,0:05:12.440
Even if He doesn't heal you.

0:05:12.440,0:05:15.300
He is the Deliverer. Even if He doesn't delivered you.

0:05:15.300,0:05:19.140
You have to give thanks to Him for those He has delivered,

0:05:19.140,0:05:22.420
and He has delivered you before - give thanks to Him.

0:05:22.420,0:05:27.440
Even if He has not delivered you now, give thanks to Him for delivering some people now.

0:05:27.440,0:05:32.100
Look at the sister that just shared her testimony. Thanks must go along with your prayer.

0:05:32.100,0:05:34.100
Are you ready with me?

0:05:34.100,0:05:41.500
You want to release yourself and your community from this yoke.

0:05:41.500,0:05:46.020

0:05:46.020,0:05:50.340
