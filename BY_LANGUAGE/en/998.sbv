0:00:00.000,0:00:05.320
What a blessed day!

0:00:05.320,0:00:12.120
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:12.120,0:00:14.120
Hallelujah.

0:00:14.120,0:00:18.640
We had to stop the testimony but I will only listen to just one

0:00:18.640,0:00:21.380
that will usher us to the next blessing.

0:00:21.380,0:00:25.360
I saw many prophetic words - that was last Sunday.

0:00:25.360,0:00:27.720
A lot.

0:00:27.720,0:00:31.600
That is the way God moves.

0:00:31.600,0:00:37.360
And when you are called or you are touched or you have a message from God,

0:00:37.360,0:00:41.880
here is message, here is solution.

0:00:41.880,0:00:47.300
What is not done well is not done at all, and God is always complete.

0:00:47.300,0:00:50.860
Hallelujah, thank you. Let's listen.

0:00:50.860,0:00:55.260
Prophecy Time

0:00:55.260,0:01:01.620
There is a young lady there, at the back of the sister wearing spectacles.

0:01:01.620,0:01:04.340
At the back there.

0:01:04.340,0:01:06.640
A very young lady.

0:01:06.640,0:01:10.020
It has been a problem for you. You have been bedwetting.

0:01:10.020,0:01:12.800
Come, don't be shy.

0:01:12.800,0:01:17.180
Prophecy Time

0:01:17.180,0:01:20.220
I said you have been bedwetting.

0:01:20.220,0:01:21.880
Yes, sir.

0:01:21.880,0:01:23.780
What a beautiful girl.

0:01:23.780,0:01:26.380
This thing has been disgracing you, even when you were in school.

0:01:26.380,0:01:27.220
Yes, sir.

0:01:27.220,0:01:29.720
Yet, the thing refuses to leave you.

0:01:29.720,0:01:32.640
Yes, sir.

0:01:32.640,0:01:33.620
Come out!

0:01:33.620,0:01:35.240
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:35.240,0:01:36.760
Come on! Leave her!

0:01:36.760,0:01:41.840
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:41.840,0:01:45.740
Out!

0:01:45.740,0:01:48.520
Who are you?

0:01:48.520,0:01:50.900
I want to destroy her!

0:01:50.900,0:01:52.300
How?

0:01:52.300,0:01:54.300
She will never get married.

0:01:54.300,0:01:55.620
What have you done to her?

0:01:55.620,0:01:58.020
She has a bright destiny.

0:01:58.020,0:02:00.300
What else have you done to her?

0:02:00.300,0:02:02.040
What have you pushed her to do?

0:02:02.040,0:02:03.480
She is my daughter.

0:02:03.480,0:02:06.080
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:06.080,0:02:08.260
I cause her to bedwet.

0:02:08.260,0:02:09.800
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:02:09.800,0:02:12.080
I am the ancestral spirit.

0:02:12.080,0:02:14.220
How did you enter her?

0:02:14.220,0:02:17.300
Through dreams.

0:02:17.300,0:02:23.240
Man of God, the prophecy you gave to my daughter is one hundred percent correct.

0:02:23.240,0:02:30.240
She has been bedwetting since childhood up to this age, while in university.

0:02:30.240,0:02:37.280
This has made her not to relax in school; she's always on and off.

0:02:37.280,0:02:41.760
Each time this thing happened, I would cry.

0:02:41.760,0:02:43.580
I wouldn't know what to do.

0:02:43.580,0:02:48.240
I thank God today that her case has been opened.

0:02:48.240,0:02:50.040
- Thank You, Jesus!
- Thank you.

0:02:50.040,0:02:52.940
Man of God, what you said about me is true.

0:02:52.940,0:02:56.400
I have been bedwetting since childbirth.

0:02:56.400,0:03:00.260
It has been disgracing me wherever I go.

0:03:00.260,0:03:02.420
It doesn't allow me to go out.

0:03:02.420,0:03:09.100
Wherever I go, it disgraces me.

0:03:09.100,0:03:10.720
You said what?

0:03:10.720,0:03:13.300
Wherever I go, it disgraces me.

0:03:13.300,0:03:14.920
I can't go out.

0:03:14.920,0:03:23.600
Sometimes I think I have to be awake so I won't disgrace myself or litter the bed.

0:03:23.600,0:03:27.100
How do you cope in the university when you are bedwetting all the time?

0:03:27.100,0:03:32.100
Sometimes, my roommates will be -

0:03:32.100,0:03:38.500
I am on the top bunk, when I urinate, it will touch the person below me.

0:03:38.500,0:03:40.600
So, the urine touches them?

0:03:40.600,0:03:45.060
Yes, sometimes, I have to sleep on the floor so I will not disgrace myself.

0:03:45.060,0:03:49.140
I will wake up very early to clean the floor and wash my clothes.

0:03:49.140,0:03:54.900
She said she sleeps on the floor and wakes up early to clean the urine.

0:03:54.900,0:03:57.820
So, don't worry, it's over!

0:03:57.820,0:04:01.940
Prophecy Time

0:04:01.940,0:04:05.700
The coming Sunday, you will come out to tell the world what happened to you.

0:04:05.700,0:04:06.920
OK, it's alright.

0:04:06.920,0:04:09.680
Glory be to God.
Hallelujah.

0:04:09.680,0:04:16.300
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:04:16.300,0:04:19.640
Today is the coming Sunday we talked about.

0:04:19.640,0:04:22.980
The whole thing happened last Sunday.

0:04:22.980,0:04:25.580
You can see the move of God.

0:04:25.580,0:04:29.900
The whole thing comes directly by vision.

0:04:29.900,0:04:33.720
Like she was called, she came out and immediately,

0:04:33.720,0:04:44.020
without touching her, stretching hand, you can see that demon cried out.

0:04:44.020,0:04:50.820
Behind every situation you are in, lies demon.

0:04:50.820,0:04:54.520
Demon is responsible.

0:04:54.520,0:04:58.380
Demon is the cause.

0:04:58.380,0:05:00.440
Let's hear from her.

0:05:00.440,0:05:04.120
After the prayer last Sunday, what happened?

0:05:04.120,0:05:07.140
Yes, hear from her.

0:05:07.140,0:05:10.040
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:05:10.040,0:05:12.220
My name is Sochima Ukpaka.

0:05:12.220,0:05:18.300
I am a student of Godfrey Okoye University, a private institution.

0:05:18.300,0:05:23.560
I am in 300 level and I am studying psychology.

0:05:23.560,0:05:29.220
The prophecy the man of God gave to me last week was true.

0:05:29.220,0:05:32.400
I was sitting right there.

0:05:32.400,0:05:40.640
Then he said, there is a young lady here, you have the problem of bedwetting.

0:05:40.640,0:05:45.720
You are seated at the back of the woman wearing spectacles.

0:05:45.720,0:05:50.500
First of all, my mind was not there.

0:05:50.500,0:05:55.060
Something tapped me, "This woman in front of you is wearing spectacles".

0:05:55.060,0:05:59.620
I said, "Jesus, it is me!" - I ran out.

0:05:59.620,0:06:05.220
This issue of bedwetting has been disturbing me.

0:06:05.220,0:06:10.400
It has caused me so much pain for the past twenty years.

0:06:10.400,0:06:17.620
Since my secondary school days I have known that "Yes, this is bedwetting".

0:06:17.620,0:06:27.240
This situation caused me not to stay in a boarding school during my secondary school

0:06:27.240,0:06:33.140
though I wanted a boarding school but my mom, as the kid I was,

0:06:33.140,0:06:36.980
she said, "'No, you will not go to a boarding school".

0:06:36.980,0:06:40.800
I asked her, "Why?"; she said, "That is known to me; don't worry".

0:06:40.800,0:06:49.320
With time, I grew up. When I was in SS 1, it was then that I understood what bedwetting was.

0:06:49.320,0:06:56.740
During that time, the issue of bedwetting disgraced me severely.

0:06:56.740,0:07:04.200
It did not disgrace me as much as when I entered the university

0:07:04.200,0:07:13.740
because I was under my mom's care, and she would try to cover me up, no matter what it was.

0:07:13.740,0:07:20.100
The shame was not there as compared to at the university level.

0:07:20.100,0:07:28.300
When I was seeking for admission, my mom was looking for a university near to us,

0:07:28.300,0:07:31.320
just because of this issue of bedwetting.

0:07:31.320,0:07:39.340
Then came a time that it stopped; I was not experiencing it.

0:07:39.340,0:07:45.920
So she said, "Okay, you can live in the boarding, in the university".

0:07:45.920,0:07:55.420
When I went back to school, in my first year, this situation disgraced me on several occasions.

0:07:55.420,0:08:00.660
In a room, there were four students.

0:08:00.660,0:08:04.800
In the boarding school - some people who know how we live in a boarding school -

0:08:04.800,0:08:10.800
there is a place where two or three stay in a room but this one we were four.

0:08:10.800,0:08:16.180
That day because I came in newly, I was in the up bunk.

0:08:16.180,0:08:19.400
When I was in the up bunk, I was sleeping.

0:08:19.400,0:08:22.220
I just slept off.

0:08:22.220,0:08:24.720
Then I bedwetted.

0:08:24.720,0:08:28.820
It touched the person who was down.

0:08:28.820,0:08:34.600
Then, another case was on broad daylight like this.

0:08:34.600,0:08:41.460
I just came back from school, and I was sitting down on the bed of another person.

0:08:41.460,0:08:48.740
I just dozed off; within five minutes, I had bedwetted on someone else's bed.

0:08:48.740,0:08:53.520
When I woke up, I started crying, "What will I do now?

0:08:53.520,0:08:57.920
If this person comes back and sees this, what will she tell me?"

0:08:57.920,0:09:03.360
In order to be clever, I took the bed up to my own side,

0:09:03.360,0:09:09.500
took my own bed to her's and washed her bed sheet.

0:09:09.500,0:09:16.900
Then, after I washed it, when she came back, she said, "Why did you wash my bed sheet? Did I beg you?"

0:09:16.910,0:09:22.400
I told her, "No, I was drinking Fanta and mistakenly it poured.

0:09:22.400,0:09:27.140
So I didn't want her trouble, that is why I washed it".

0:09:27.140,0:09:28.900
I thought that was okay.

0:09:28.900,0:09:34.320
But often, it started occurring to the extent that they knew about it.

0:09:34.320,0:09:37.600
Whenever all these things happened, I would run to my mom.

0:09:37.600,0:09:41.260
She would tell me, "Continue praying, God will hear your prayers".

0:09:41.260,0:09:45.680
I would say, "Praying? Since you have been praying for me, nothing has happened".

0:09:45.680,0:09:48.700
She was telling me, "Continue praying, have that faith".

0:09:48.700,0:09:54.240
It disgraced me in my cousin's place in the village.

0:09:54.240,0:10:00.940
It disgraced me in many places in this life. I couldn't go out.

0:10:00.940,0:10:07.440
In order not to be cleaning up, because it is not every day one would be washing one's bed sheets -

0:10:07.440,0:10:12.580
because people around would say, "This girl is so clean; she is washing her bed sheets every day".

0:10:12.580,0:10:17.180
They would feel like you are so clean, but they would not know the situation you are passing through.

0:10:17.180,0:10:25.680
But even if you wash the bed sheets, the bed itself - even if you take it outside for the sun to touch it,

0:10:25.680,0:10:30.700
the smell sometimes would come out, and what would you tell them?

0:10:30.700,0:10:34.240
So it resulted in me sleeping on the floor.

0:10:34.240,0:10:38.660
I started sleeping on the floor and I would wake up as early as anything,

0:10:38.660,0:10:41.320
just to wash and clean up.

0:10:41.320,0:10:48.700
Sometimes for people not to be suspicious of what was happening,

0:10:48.700,0:10:55.000
I would put it into a plastic bag and take it back home

0:10:55.000,0:11:01.040
for my mom to wash, to help me and wash it so that I would not be disgraced.

0:11:01.040,0:11:06.880
Could you share with us your experiences and what happened till now?

0:11:06.880,0:11:11.220
Daddy, after the prayer, I went back to the hotel room.

0:11:11.220,0:11:17.600
I was like, "Are you serious? Just like that? I'm not sure it is true".

0:11:17.600,0:11:23.600
Then I went home. My mom said, "Have faith, it is done", and I said, "Okay, let's see".

0:11:23.600,0:11:26.520
I took six sachets of water that night.

0:11:26.520,0:11:33.200
Normally, I wouldn't take water or anything from 5 or 6 pm.

0:11:33.200,0:11:40.920
So I took water and drank all and made sure that I was full enough.

0:11:40.920,0:11:43.100
I said to myself, "Okay, let's try it".

0:11:43.100,0:11:46.100
I went to bed; I just laid down.

0:11:46.100,0:11:50.940
Normally, even if I wanted to pray or do something,

0:11:50.940,0:11:54.980
sometimes I would sleep off, or something would happen.

0:11:54.980,0:12:02.380
So that day, I brought out my faith bracelet and said, "How will I start now?"

0:12:02.380,0:12:08.800
I brought out my faith bracelet and said, "Okay, they are doing like this" - I started meditating

0:12:08.800,0:12:11.420
I was counting, and I asked myself, "What will I say?"

0:12:11.420,0:12:16.800
I remembered that they said, "Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of You".

0:12:16.800,0:12:19.840
I was like, "Okay, let's start with that one now".

0:12:19.840,0:12:21.760
I started counting it.

0:12:21.760,0:12:27.140
As I was doing that, I just slept off and  woke up around 9.

0:12:27.140,0:12:31.720
Normally, I had to wake up like four or five times.

0:12:31.720,0:12:36.040
During those processes of waking up, I would be tired of sleeping and say, "Let me not sleep,

0:12:36.040,0:12:40.920
let me just be awake so that if the urine comes, I will just go and urinate".

0:12:40.920,0:12:54.320
But this time I did not wake up; I just slept and woke up without bedwetting on the bed.

0:12:54.320,0:13:03.940
And since then, for the past seven days, I have never bedwetted, I have been sleeping.

0:13:03.940,0:13:08.780
And before now, it happened every day?

0:13:08.780,0:13:12.100
Before now, I bedwetted every day.

0:13:12.100,0:13:15.380
I got used to it. I was like, "When I wake up, I'll just wash".

0:13:15.380,0:13:18.800
It was a normal thing; that was it.

0:13:18.800,0:13:23.800
But when I woke up that morning, I was like, "Hey, let me go and wash it. It is morning now".

0:13:23.800,0:13:26.400
So I woke up, looked around, "I'm dry!

0:13:26.400,0:13:32.860
Okay, let me check the floor, maybe I was turning and urinated on the floor".

0:13:32.860,0:13:37.460
I checked the floor, smelled my clothes and was like, "Ah, this is true!"

0:13:37.460,0:13:39.760
So I am free indeed.

0:13:39.760,0:13:41.660
Did you listen to that?

0:13:41.660,0:13:47.500
Being a young girl, she has never experienced this kind of thing.

0:13:47.500,0:13:50.700
They have gone to many places.

0:13:50.700,0:13:53.480
Okay, let's see. Where will I start?

0:13:53.480,0:14:04.820
This is to tell you that when it is your time, or when you meet a man God sent to you,

0:14:04.820,0:14:08.440
whether you believe or not, it will definitely happen

0:14:08.440,0:14:17.880
but that your belief will only help you to maintain that God send the man to give you.

0:14:17.880,0:14:23.800
When the prophecy concerning her was given, she looked back and said, "Are they calling me?"

0:14:23.800,0:14:27.940
She was not here because of that situation, she just believed that it was a normal way life

0:14:27.940,0:14:32.740
and it would continue like that - it was a different thing she was here for.

0:14:32.740,0:14:37.480
But even after the deliverance, she began to ask herself,

0:14:37.480,0:14:43.300
"Does it mean I'm free? Is that how things happen?"

0:14:43.300,0:14:49.780
When you meet a man that God sent to set you free or deliver you,

0:14:49.780,0:14:53.400
it may not be a man, it may be an object.

0:14:53.400,0:15:00.140
You know God can use anything, not necessarily a human being.

0:15:00.140,0:15:04.540
An object - it could be water or anything.

0:15:04.540,0:15:07.060
Whether you believe it or not.

0:15:07.060,0:15:14.000
You may not believe but it will happen but to now maintain that blessing, your belief is important.

0:15:14.000,0:15:20.700
This is what youths need now to come back to God.

0:15:20.700,0:15:25.680
Youths - their hearts are so hardened.

0:15:25.680,0:15:31.860
The young people today - this is what they need to come back to God.

0:15:31.860,0:15:39.160
When you tell them about Jesus and you are very eloquent,

0:15:39.160,0:15:44.820
they will tell you they have studied it in the university.

0:15:44.820,0:15:52.220
But they want to see what they have not and what they cannot study in university happens to them.

0:15:52.220,0:15:55.360
What happened now?

0:15:55.360,0:15:59.360
Call youths and begin to preach about Jesus, about God.

0:15:59.360,0:16:03.540
They will tell you, "Look, we have studied all this in school".

0:16:03.540,0:16:09.440
Those who have not studied this in school, they will say, "No, I can take a book and read about it".

0:16:09.440,0:16:18.340
They want to experience what they have not studied in university and what they cannot study in the college.

0:16:18.340,0:16:28.900
They are yearning for a new thing, a new wave, a new direction, a new course.

0:16:28.900,0:16:36.780
This is why it is difficult for us to change or tame our youths or mentor our children.

0:16:36.780,0:16:41.120
These days, you cannot mentor your children. You go this way, they go that way

0:16:41.120,0:16:45.400
because all you are telling them, they know better than you.

0:16:45.400,0:16:51.160
Man of God, I want to thank you for allowing God to use you to deliver me

0:16:51.160,0:16:58.700
because I felt like all hope was lost; I felt isolated.

0:16:58.700,0:17:01.540
I didn't want to come close to people.

0:17:01.540,0:17:04.980
I would be like, "If you knew the problem I am passing through,

0:17:04.980,0:17:08.960
would you like to be my friend and the rest?"

0:17:08.960,0:17:14.320
I felt that this was my world, that that was how I had to face it.

0:17:14.320,0:17:18.200
Can we ask you one question and I want you to be free and tell us.

0:17:18.200,0:17:20.900
While you were going through this problem,

0:17:20.900,0:17:24.360
what were you actually thinking up to do with your life?

0:17:24.360,0:17:28.400
They are problems that your parents cannot help you, nobody can help you with.

0:17:28.400,0:17:32.900
In this situation, you have many things you keep to yourself

0:17:32.900,0:17:37.700
which you did not want to tell anybody and you were always thinking about.

0:17:37.700,0:17:43.100
What were you thinking to do with your life while going through this problem? Tell us.

0:17:43.100,0:17:47.280
So many times I felt like committing suicide.

0:17:47.280,0:17:50.400
I felt like, "Let me end it all.

0:17:50.400,0:17:56.800
How can I come out in front of people and tell them I'm bedwetting?"

0:17:56.800,0:18:02.040
Even when suitors came, I would be like, "Are you people serious?

0:18:02.040,0:18:05.400
If you knew what I am, that I am bedwetting,

0:18:05.400,0:18:10.620
would you want a bedwetter as your wife or anything?"

0:18:10.620,0:18:14.740
I just felt like committing suicide so many times.

0:18:14.740,0:18:22.900
I've tried to do it in front of my mom, and she would tell me, "Stop it; it is not the end of the world".

0:18:22.900,0:18:25.800
It's over. That's why we are asking you questions; we are not making jest.

0:18:25.800,0:18:30.660
We are happy with you, and we want to learn.

0:18:30.660,0:18:35.700
Did you ever think that one day, you will meet a man in your future

0:18:35.700,0:18:38.720
that will accept you with that bedwetting?

0:18:38.720,0:18:43.940
As beautiful as you are, a man will accept to marry you with that bedwetting? Tell us.

0:18:43.940,0:18:44.720
No.!

0:18:44.720,0:18:45.320
Why?

0:18:45.320,0:18:48.380
I concluded that I would not get married; I didn't want to get married.

0:18:48.380,0:18:49.720
Why?

0:18:49.720,0:18:56.880
Because I feel like it is a shame - who will accept me, no matter what it is?

0:18:56.880,0:19:00.480
Will you rise up and give glory to God.

0:19:00.480,0:19:02.440
Give glory to God.

0:19:02.440,0:19:07.520
When she was sharing the testimony, you'll just look at it, she's a bedwetter, God has healed her.

0:19:07.520,0:19:10.280
You never knew that it is more than that.

0:19:10.280,0:19:14.260
Inside her, she was planning to commit suicide.

0:19:14.260,0:19:16.020
She said...

0:19:16.020,0:19:19.340
And all this, she kept away from her mom.

0:19:19.340,0:19:22.920
With that, she could never be an obedient child to her mom

0:19:22.920,0:19:27.340
because she felt there was something a parent cannot solve.

0:19:27.340,0:19:31.620
"This problem - my parent cannot solve it." - this is where disobedience comes.

0:19:31.620,0:19:34.520
"Ah, I have this problem, who can solve it? Nobody!"

0:19:34.520,0:19:39.580
Definitely the thought of not obeying your parents.

0:19:39.580,0:19:41.500
Give thanks to God for this.

0:19:41.500,0:19:47.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:47.500,0:19:49.620
Hallelujah!

0:19:49.620,0:19:53.900
There were many things she was keeping them away from you.

0:19:53.900,0:19:55.300
She is right.

0:19:55.300,0:19:58.480
Because she thought since you could not help her...

0:19:58.480,0:20:00.600
Okay, what else again?

0:20:00.600,0:20:05.240
You saw her then as an obedient child, she tried to be obedient

0:20:05.240,0:20:13.240
but she had a thorn in her flesh which no one could...

0:20:13.240,0:20:19.980
If it is cancer - no problem. Nobody will know, until it is very serious.

0:20:19.980,0:20:23.480
But this one, you can't keep it. For how long will you keep it?

0:20:23.480,0:20:26.600
All the students knew about it.

0:20:26.600,0:20:30.380
If you keep it away from the man you want to marry, after you get to the house of the man,

0:20:30.380,0:20:34.480
one week or two weeks, the man will know.

0:20:34.480,0:20:39.200
So let's hear from you: What message do you have for the viewers all over the world?

0:20:39.200,0:20:44.400
I advise the viewers all over the world to have faith.

0:20:44.400,0:20:47.820
You are now preaching faith?

0:20:47.820,0:20:51.880
Glory be to God. She said you should have faith.

0:20:51.880,0:20:56.180
A faithless generation now has faith.

0:20:56.180,0:20:58.820
She said, have faith.

0:20:58.820,0:21:06.720
I preached to them to have faith because as I was made to understand, joy is the fruit of faith.

0:21:06.720,0:21:16.360
So have faith; God is the God of the last hour - no matter the time or when you feel, all hope is lost.

0:21:16.360,0:21:21.160
Just believe in God, always trust in Him; He will do it.

0:21:21.160,0:21:25.060
He is the One who makes the impossible to be possible.

0:21:25.060,0:21:26.900
So just have faith in Him.

0:21:26.900,0:21:29.260
And to the youth out there:

0:21:29.260,0:21:32.640
There are so many situations which you are passing through.

0:21:32.640,0:21:35.160
You feel it is the end of the world.

0:21:35.160,0:21:39.100
It is not the end of the world; run to God.

0:21:39.100,0:21:43.260
He is the only true Father that never fails.

0:21:43.260,0:21:46.920
Thank you, clap for her.

0:21:46.920,0:21:51.800
Mama, are you happy?

0:21:51.800,0:21:54.000
Yes, I am very happy.

0:21:54.000,0:21:57.080
Now, you are having a child.

0:21:57.080,0:22:03.220
Before, she belonged to someone, not you.

0:22:03.220,0:22:08.820
She was a child you could lose then in the past suddenly.

0:22:08.820,0:22:11.920
But now, here you have a child.

0:22:11.920,0:22:20.020
Let me ask you a question: When you knew that your daughter was going through all this situation,

0:22:20.020,0:22:24.180
what was your effort to rescue her?

0:22:24.180,0:22:26.320
What effort?

0:22:26.320,0:22:28.120
Tell us, just in a nut shell.

0:22:28.120,0:22:31.240
At what time did you know about it?

0:22:31.240,0:22:38.600
And at the same time, did she actually try to keep this challenge away from you

0:22:38.600,0:22:43.360
or was she open to let you know any time this situation happened?

0:22:43.360,0:22:45.340
Was she open to you? Tell us.

0:22:45.340,0:22:48.120
My name is Mrs Ukpaka.

0:22:48.120,0:22:50.300
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:22:50.300,0:22:57.120
I discovered this when she entered secondary school, because at that time,

0:22:57.120,0:23:05.220
she was supposed to be free, not to be bedwetting, so when I now noticed that

0:23:05.220,0:23:12.560
I went closer to her and asked her some questions.

0:23:12.560,0:23:19.660
She started telling me that, in fact, she didn't like what she was seeing.

0:23:19.660,0:23:22.420
That it was better for her to die.

0:23:22.420,0:23:25.200
So I told her that it was not the best to...

0:23:25.200,0:23:27.200
She said it is better for her to do what?

0:23:27.200,0:23:27.900
To die.

0:23:27.900,0:23:31.620
Okay, she has told you this.

0:23:31.620,0:23:35.040
That was what made me to even go closer to her.

0:23:35.040,0:23:39.280
So I never allowed her to stay alone.

0:23:39.280,0:23:42.300
So you knew that she was nursing to die.

0:23:42.300,0:23:43.160
Yes, sir.

0:23:43.160,0:23:44.570
Okay.

0:23:44.570,0:23:52.720
When I noticed it, I took her to the hospital for the first time to check her system.

0:23:52.720,0:23:56.040
They said that nothing was wrong with her.

0:23:56.040,0:24:03.780
I went to many places for prayers and there was no solution.

0:24:03.780,0:24:08.760
I now said that I must come here with her

0:24:08.760,0:24:17.640
because I know that this is the only place where I will have a solution to that problem

0:24:17.640,0:24:21.140
and that was why I brought her.

0:24:21.140,0:24:24.560
God is good all the time!

0:24:24.560,0:24:29.540
Thank you. Hallelujah.

0:24:29.540,0:24:31.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:31.840,0:24:36.260
While you are sitting down, wherever you are, viewers all over the world,

0:24:36.260,0:24:40.880
begin to compare your situation to this lady's situation.

0:24:40.880,0:24:52.060
What kind of situation are you having that can be compared with her former situation?

0:24:52.060,0:24:54.960
This is how faith comes.

0:24:54.960,0:25:00.320
Many of you think you have to read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.

0:25:00.320,0:25:03.960
Faith is natural.

0:25:03.960,0:25:11.400
Immediately you realise that God is reliable, with what you are seeing now, He is reliable.

0:25:11.400,0:25:15.260
This shows Jesus is reliable.

0:25:15.260,0:25:17.260
Jesus is what?

0:25:17.260,0:25:18.580
He is reliable.

0:25:18.580,0:25:33.340
Immediately you agree and believe Jesus is reliable, faith grows spontaneously, naturally.

0:25:33.340,0:25:40.120
It comes just like that and you begin to build on that.

0:25:40.120,0:25:50.900
So you need to now establish it - "Ah, Jesus is reliable, I can rely on Him. He will never fail".

0:25:50.900,0:25:55.000
No matter the situation you have, you are looking for faith.

0:25:55.000,0:25:58.140
"How will I get faith. I will memorise the Bible.

0:25:58.140,0:26:02.560
I will read my Bible from Genesis, go to church every day."

0:26:02.560,0:26:04.880
Yes, good.

0:26:04.880,0:26:08.340
It is a good idea.

0:26:08.340,0:26:18.480
But one of the shortest ways to have that faith in God is the one we have just witnessed now.

0:26:18.480,0:26:22.700
You have heard, you have seen

0:26:22.700,0:26:26.020
and the lady is confessing what she went through

0:26:26.020,0:26:31.000
and you saw how she was spotted and she came out.

0:26:31.000,0:26:40.900
And immediately, "By the name Jesus Christ, be delivered!", she screamed, "Hii!"

0:26:40.900,0:26:45.080
Without touching her - immediately.

0:26:45.080,0:26:49.680
Now, it is over!

0:26:49.680,0:26:57.640
When you now sit down and meditate over and over and turn it over and over in your heart...

0:26:57.640,0:27:00.080
Tell your neighbour, "Turn it over and over in your heart".

0:27:00.080,0:27:01.660
Turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:01.660,0:27:02.900
I can't hear you.

0:27:02.900,0:27:04.240
Turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:04.240,0:27:11.400
I say, what you hear now, what you have seen now, turn it over and over again in your heart.

0:27:11.400,0:27:12.960
Tell your neighbour.

0:27:12.960,0:27:15.020
Turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:15.020,0:27:16.500
I can't hear you.

0:27:16.500,0:27:18.280
Turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:18.280,0:27:19.540
I can't hear you.

0:27:19.540,0:27:21.020
Turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:21.020,0:27:22.380
Again and again.

0:27:22.380,0:27:24.400
Turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:24.400,0:27:27.160
Yes, you have to.

0:27:27.160,0:27:41.960
Now you have seen what happened, it is time now to turn it over and over again in your hearts.

0:27:41.960,0:27:47.320
Here faith comes.

0:27:47.320,0:27:50.600
Only faith pleases God.

0:27:50.600,0:27:52.700
Begin to turn it over and over.

0:27:52.700,0:27:55.960
Tell your neighbour, "Begin to turn it over and over in your heart".

0:27:55.960,0:27:57.740
Begin to turn it over and over in your heart.

0:27:57.740,0:28:01.400
In your heart - that is, in a natural way.

0:28:01.400,0:28:04.720
We call it thinking but it is not thinking - meditation

0:28:04.720,0:28:10.680
because when you think, thinking is here - meditation is above thinking.

0:28:10.680,0:28:19.180
Faith prevails over thinking processing.

0:28:19.180,0:28:23.040
If you now use the word 'thinking', you are not right.

0:28:23.040,0:28:30.340
Faith prevails over thinking processing.

0:28:30.340,0:28:41.520
Begin to meditate over and over again in your heart.

0:28:41.520,0:28:43.420
How do we think?

0:28:43.420,0:28:51.160
The word 'thinking' naturally is "I am poor. Will my prayers be answered today?

0:28:51.160,0:28:55.100
Will this man discover me in the midst of people?

0:28:55.100,0:29:00.060
Will this man fetch me out just in the same way he fetched this lady?

0:29:00.060,0:29:03.700
What time are we leaving here today?

0:29:03.700,0:29:05.360
I don't know.

0:29:05.360,0:29:07.980
I still feel the pain.

0:29:07.980,0:29:10.720
Will the man pray for me?

0:29:10.720,0:29:17.220
But I'm feeling hungry now. If I leave here, somebody will take over my seat.

0:29:17.220,0:29:23.100
I will not leave and I'm pressed now. I will endure".

0:29:23.100,0:29:27.240
These are the thinking.

0:29:27.240,0:29:30.760
Thinking means, what we don't mean.

0:29:30.760,0:29:38.660
Often, you don't mean it. By the time I meet you, you change because it is not from your heart.

0:29:38.660,0:29:41.700
Oftentimes, what we think, we don't mean it.

0:29:41.700,0:29:49.100
Tell your neighbour, "Oftentimes, what we think, we don't mean it".

0:29:49.100,0:29:57.260
But if you are able to meditate over an issue, you mean it because it is from your heart.

0:29:57.260,0:30:00.180
What is going on in your heart now is thinking.

0:30:00.180,0:30:04.020
Tell your neighbour, "What is going on in your heart now is thinking".

0:30:04.020,0:30:07.940
Your mind is floating; it is floating.

0:30:07.940,0:30:14.960
By the time I want to pray for you, you say, "Is he going to fall me?"

0:30:14.960,0:30:18.080
You will not say it out, but in your mind.

0:30:18.080,0:30:23.180
Immediately I face you, because you normally see the way people are rolling on the floor

0:30:23.180,0:30:27.700
and fall down, and you know they will be looking at you at home...

0:30:27.700,0:30:32.500
You say, some people just believe that once you fall, you are a witch or wizard

0:30:32.500,0:30:34.780
whereas there is nothing like that.

0:30:34.780,0:30:37.340
People just believe once you fall, "Ah!".

0:30:37.340,0:30:42.680
But you know when you fall down, people will say "Ah, we saw when they were delivering you.

0:30:42.680,0:30:47.760
We didn't know that you are the cause of our problems".

0:30:47.760,0:30:54.680
Many people are here today, immediately I get to them, this is the way you see them standing.

0:30:54.680,0:31:01.200
In their heart they say, "Is he going to fall me?"

0:31:01.200,0:31:03.780
So that is thinking.

0:31:03.780,0:31:08.720
As we are talking now, people that have God seem to lose it again.

0:31:08.720,0:31:10.580
A lot of things are going on in your heart.

0:31:10.580,0:31:15.200
If you don't believe, you just think everything is money, money, money.

0:31:15.200,0:31:21.480
"How can somebody give me something like this? No!"

0:31:21.480,0:31:29.460
People lost God because they believe that they can't get anything -

0:31:29.460,0:31:36.520
"be healed!" - without money exchange.

0:31:36.520,0:31:41.260
You want God back? Give freely.

0:31:41.260,0:31:45.020
God is looking for people that will give freely.

0:31:45.020,0:31:47.600
Are you ready to give freely?

0:31:47.600,0:31:52.640
Even though you don't have, can you give freely?

0:31:52.640,0:32:02.000
Yes, give freely and see what will happen, your life will change suddenly.

0:32:02.000,0:32:09.360
Before you have abundant in your pocket - you don't have now - you can still give freely.

0:32:09.360,0:32:12.620
Soon you will have abundance.

0:32:12.620,0:32:18.880
We lost God because we believe we cannot give without receiving money.

0:32:18.880,0:32:21.680
Man of God, I want to beg for something.

0:32:21.680,0:32:27.620
Please, I need one fruit.

0:32:27.620,0:32:34.540
Not only you - you and your mummy should come and take a fruit.

0:32:34.540,0:32:43.920
No! If that will make her to follow Jesus fully, in fact I will ask her to carry the whole basket here.

0:32:43.920,0:32:51.960
As I will give you anything for the salvation of your soul.

0:32:51.960,0:32:56.040
She is not the one I delivered oo!

0:32:56.040,0:33:00.620
She now went to carry a fruit. Okay, carry it and go.

0:33:00.620,0:33:02.140
Okay, thank you!

0:33:02.140,0:33:14.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:14.500,0:33:21.720
A better way to pay your tithes is to learn how to give out there free.

0:33:21.720,0:33:27.020
You know them - those who need what you have, give them freely.

0:33:27.020,0:33:29.420
You are paying your tithes.

0:33:29.420,0:33:34.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:34.620,0:33:42.780
Viewers all over the world, every good thing the Lord has given you,

0:33:42.780,0:33:50.460
use it to bless and care for those who are in need of what you have.

0:33:50.460,0:33:55.000
Those who are in need of what you have, you know them.

0:33:55.000,0:34:07.780
The poor, needy, widow, and those whom you are better - help them.

0:34:07.780,0:34:16.640
Like I have said, mere smile.

0:34:16.640,0:34:22.420
Just say to your neighbour, "I love you".

0:34:22.420,0:34:25.800
What a wonderful blessing.

0:34:25.800,0:34:29.420
And this must come from your heart.

0:34:29.420,0:34:39.160
When I say neighbour- it could be your enemy, those who do not share the same faith with you.

0:34:39.160,0:34:44.740
Say to them, "I love you" with all your heart.

0:34:44.740,0:34:45.820
Tell your neighbour.

0:34:45.820,0:34:47.340
I love you with all my heart.

0:34:47.340,0:34:48.480
Tell your neighbour.

0:34:48.480,0:34:50.660
I love you with all my heart.

0:34:50.670,0:34:51.600
Again.

0:34:51.600,0:34:53.679
I love you with all my heart.

0:34:53.680,0:34:55.400
Tell your neighbour again.

0:34:55.400,0:34:57.480
I love you with all my heart.

0:34:57.480,0:34:58.720
Again and again.

0:34:58.720,0:35:00.960
I love you with all my heart.

0:35:00.960,0:35:02.180
Again and again.

0:35:02.180,0:35:04.620
I love you with all my heart.

0:35:04.620,0:35:08.000
Love with all your heart.

0:35:08.000,0:35:15.300
It delivers one, it blesses one, it heals the wound of one.

0:35:15.300,0:35:19.260
We are not talking of fleshly love.

0:35:19.260,0:35:21.880
Say, "I love you with all my heart".

0:35:21.880,0:35:27.600
If I love you with all my heart, your wound will be healed.

0:35:27.600,0:35:32.740
You will feel the presence of God immediately.

0:35:32.740,0:35:35.100
Can you say to your neighbour, "I love you".

0:35:35.100,0:35:36.340
I love you.

0:35:36.340,0:35:37.420
I can't hear you.

0:35:37.420,0:35:38.600
I love you.

0:35:38.600,0:35:39.600
I can't hear you.

0:35:39.600,0:35:40.780
I love you.

0:35:40.780,0:35:47.130
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:47.130,0:35:52.020
So can you rise up, and let me bless you with this language.

0:35:52.020,0:35:53.900
Rise up.

0:35:53.900,0:36:00.500
If you now go out and say "I love you" and it is not from your heart, you are raining curses on yourself.

0:36:00.500,0:36:03.940
It is a message, and you should live by this message.

0:36:03.940,0:36:09.740
Are you ready to receive the word 'love' in your heart?

0:36:09.740,0:36:19.060
Receive, in the name of Jesus!

0:36:19.060,0:36:24.900
When you love your neighbour with all your heart, you love God.

0:36:24.900,0:36:29.180
When you help your neighbour with all your heart, you help God.

0:36:29.180,0:36:33.520
When you greet your neighbour with all your heart, you greet God.

0:36:33.520,0:36:39.460
When you help your neighbour with all your heart, you help God.

0:36:39.460,0:36:41.660
You have been helping people for so long.

0:36:41.660,0:36:48.020
God was not aware because this help was not from your heart.

0:36:48.020,0:36:54.460
You can give trillion dollars, billion pounds to people as a way of help,

0:36:54.460,0:36:59.980
but if it is not from your heart, you are wasting your time.

0:36:59.980,0:37:03.960
If your worship is not from your heart, you are wasting your time.

0:37:03.960,0:37:13.380
Christianity lies in the heart.

0:37:13.380,0:37:18.500
When you greet your neighbour with all your heart, you greet God.

0:37:18.500,0:37:24.300
When you help your neighbour with all your heart, you help God.

0:37:24.300,0:37:30.080
If you have being helping your neighbour with all your heart, God will help you, you will be helped.

0:37:30.080,0:37:33.400
Help; you will be helped.

0:37:33.400,0:37:37.880
Show mercy and you will receive mercy.

0:37:37.880,0:37:41.100
Show kindness and you will receive kindness.

0:37:41.100,0:37:45.300
You have been doing this, but not with all your heart.

0:37:45.300,0:37:51.320
This is why you keep asking yourself, "Look, I help people.

0:37:51.320,0:37:57.120
I do this. I trained this man, I helped this man, I paid the loan for this man.

0:37:57.120,0:38:01.060
I paid school fees for this man, I helped this man, I trained this man".

0:38:01.060,0:38:08.260
But at the end, it was opposite to you because all these were not from your heart.

0:38:08.260,0:38:12.180
You were doing them for the reason known to you.

0:38:12.180,0:38:15.440
Viewers, listen.

0:38:15.440,0:38:19.600
Just say to your neighbour - your neighbour could be your enemy,

0:38:19.600,0:38:22.260
those who do not share the same faith with you -

0:38:22.260,0:38:25.760
say to your neighbour, "I love you".

0:38:25.760,0:38:29.160
This must be with all your heart.

0:38:29.160,0:38:33.340
If you love your neighbour with all your heart, you love God.

0:38:33.340,0:38:38.560
If you love God, what happens, what comes next?

0:38:38.560,0:38:44.220
God will be your strength, your Provider.

0:38:44.220,0:38:51.620
If God becomes your Provider, what a blessing!

0:38:51.620,0:38:58.060
I command your heart to receive the word 'love'.

0:38:58.060,0:39:17.920
Love enough.

0:39:17.920,0:39:21.160
When you have this love we are talking about,

0:39:21.160,0:39:28.500
you will always see your contribution to others as God's responsibility.

0:39:28.500,0:39:35.180
Whatever you give, you give it to God.

0:39:35.180,0:39:41.840
Someone runs to you, someone is in need of help, you say, "Ah, this man is not a Christian".

0:39:41.840,0:39:43.700
And he is in need of help!

0:39:43.700,0:39:45.000
Can you see?

0:39:45.000,0:39:47.720
What are you reading in the Bible?

0:39:47.720,0:39:51.300
You need to move above your senses.

0:39:51.300,0:39:54.580
It is mere senses.

0:39:54.580,0:39:56.520
Tit for tat.

0:39:56.520,0:39:59.000
What is the message you are taking home now?

0:39:59.000,0:40:00.260
I love you.

0:40:00.260,0:40:02.140
Are you going to say that to your enemy?

0:40:02.140,0:40:03.460
Yes!

0:40:03.460,0:40:05.700
Those who do not share the same faith with you?

0:40:05.700,0:40:06.700
Yes.

0:40:06.700,0:40:07.760
Once again.

0:40:07.760,0:40:09.400
I love you.

0:40:09.400,0:40:11.220
Oh my God! Clap for Jesus!
