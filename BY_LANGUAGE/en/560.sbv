0:00:00.040,0:00:05.720
Watch as God uses Prophet T.B. Joshua to separate the darkness from light in the lives of these people.

0:00:05.720,0:00:07.720
The right hand of God is power.

0:00:07.720,0:00:10.880
The lighting of God is moving through Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:00:10.880,0:00:13.520
to meet the needs of people from all over the world.

0:00:13.520,0:00:17.280
As he walks among the visitors during the first service giving words of prophecy,

0:00:17.280,0:00:20.160
he swiftly moves to a certain man at the back.

0:00:20.160,0:00:26.180
Brother, don't run from me. God loves you, give me your hand.

0:00:26.180,0:00:31.440
You will come to the prayer line today.I will see you there, OK?

0:00:31.440,0:00:37.420
I will see you. I am your friend. Please don't run from me. I love you.

0:00:37.420,0:00:39.700
He says he is scared.

0:00:39.700,0:00:41.100
You are scared?

0:00:41.100,0:00:41.680
Yes.

0:00:41.680,0:00:56.860
What is disturbing him is that mine is positive, his own is negative and I want to deliver him.

0:00:56.860,0:00:57.900
That’s correct.

0:00:57.900,0:01:00.640
It's true.

0:01:00.640,0:01:06.120
Later in the second service, the same man awaits his meeting with the man of God

0:01:06.120,0:01:09.160
in the prayer line of The SCOAN.

0:01:09.160,0:01:14.220
Many others too await this encounter with the problem solver Jesus Christ.

0:01:14.220,0:01:21.400
They have come from different countries with different hopes, different expectations, but with one assurance,

0:01:21.400,0:01:26.380
Jesus is who He says He is and He can do what He says He can do.

0:01:26.380,0:01:30.280
Let us see what will happen next.

0:01:30.280,0:01:35.260
This is the promised meeting the man of God prophesied about in the first service.

0:01:35.260,0:01:37.860
Martien is now receiving prayer from the Prophet

0:01:37.860,0:01:41.480
and is undergoing deliverance from the many problems he came with.

0:01:41.480,0:01:48.660
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:01:48.660,0:01:53.720
What is happening during the prayer goes to show that we are in a warfare.

0:01:53.720,0:01:57.200
Prophet T.B. Joshua is not fighting a natural situation.

0:01:57.200,0:02:01.420
He is not fighting against flesh and blood but against what we cannot see.

0:02:01.420,0:02:03.400
It's a spiritual battle.

0:02:03.400,0:02:08.860
Let's watch the operation of the Holy Spirit.

0:02:08.860,0:02:12.360
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:02:12.360,0:02:16.120
Look as he grabs the chair fearlessly attempts to attack the Prophet

0:02:16.120,0:02:20.620
He is being pushed by the negative spirit the man of God had spoken about earlier,

0:02:20.620,0:02:25.620
but because of the power and the anointing of God in the life of Prophet T.B Joshua,

0:02:25.620,0:02:29.760
he is unable to succeed.

0:02:29.760,0:02:34.500
There is nothing God cannot command, control and instruct,

0:02:34.500,0:02:40.940
all power in Heaven and on earth has been invested in that name Jesus Christ.

0:02:40.940,0:02:46.820
Right now you can see his muscles are extremely tense, he's gripping his chair, tensions on the rise.

0:02:46.820,0:02:49.840
It seems like he wants to attack the Prophet again.

0:02:49.840,0:02:51.700
Maybe he wants to go for round two.

0:02:51.700,0:02:53.940
The aggression in him is just too much.

0:02:53.940,0:02:57.420
Well, satan can only attempt but he cannot succeed

0:02:57.420,0:03:01.940
because greater is He who is in the Prophet than he who is in this man.

0:03:01.940,0:03:04.180
Oh look at the tattoo on his arm.

0:03:04.180,0:03:07.700
Look at the ring in his eyebrow, the expression on his face.

0:03:07.700,0:03:09.600
Hold on - the Prophet is calling him.

0:03:09.600,0:03:10.480
Could this be round two?

0:03:10.480,0:03:13.280
Well, there is only one way to find out, let's watch.

0:03:13.280,0:03:23.840
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:03:23.840,0:03:25.980
Do you think the battle is over?

0:03:25.980,0:03:29.740
Hmmm..... wow, he's smiling.

0:03:29.740,0:03:31.660
Do you want to hit me?

0:03:31.660,0:03:34.520
No, it's something inside me.

0:03:34.520,0:03:35.780
Something inside of you?

0:03:35.780,0:03:37.720
And I want to deliver you,

0:03:37.720,0:03:44.960
so remaining just two; you'll be free, OK.

0:03:44.960,0:03:48.300
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:03:48.300,0:03:49.380
Stand up; come back.

0:03:49.380,0:03:55.140
Demons are going out because they are commanded to go in the name of Jesus Christ.

0:03:55.140,0:03:59.020
This is the power of God in action.

0:03:59.020,0:04:01.440
Deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.

0:04:01.440,0:04:11.000
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:04:11.000,0:04:16.980
His expression says it all. Satan is powerless in the face of God's amour and weapons.

0:04:16.980,0:04:55.260
Deliverance In Jesus' Name

0:04:55.260,0:05:05.040
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, be free!

0:05:05.040,0:05:08.420
Be delivered, in Jesus' name!

0:05:08.420,0:05:11.680
Amen. Thank You, Lord.

0:05:11.680,0:05:17.420
Don't ask yourself whether you are free or not. This is a testimony that you are free.

0:05:23.240,0:05:27.480
As Martien stands up, the look on his face clearly shows

0:05:27.480,0:05:32.620
that his life has been turned from one of frustration to fulfilment.

0:05:32.620,0:05:54.940
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:05:54.940,0:05:58.660
Now am delivered! Thank God. I am free.

0:05:58.660,0:06:02.100
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:06:02.100,0:06:07.220
I thank God of Prophet Joshua; T.B Joshua is a real man of God.

0:06:07.220,0:06:18.500
TESTIMONY TIME

0:06:18.500,0:06:23.200
Sir, you are welcome here to The SCOAN here in Lagos, Nigeria.

0:06:23.200,0:06:28.580
Can you please tell us your name, your age and the country you come from?

0:06:28.580,0:06:35.240
My name is Martien. I am from Holland and I am 42 years old.

0:06:35.240,0:06:39.180
What was the problem that you were having before you came to The SCOAN

0:06:39.180,0:06:42.980
and can you just tell us some of the experiences that you were having.

0:06:42.980,0:06:50.840
The reason I came to The SCOAN is that I had a very bad violent nature

0:06:50.840,0:06:59.740
and because of that I was so scared. I tried to kill myself several times.

0:06:59.740,0:07:10.960
After that I felt I had no meaning in my life, no role, no purpose.

0:07:10.960,0:07:13.840
I became very violent and it became worse and worse and worse

0:07:13.840,0:07:18.860
until I heard voices in my head that led me to do some things.

0:07:18.860,0:07:26.060
When I was walking in the street, I hit people very bad. I could knock people down.

0:07:26.060,0:07:29.420
I was in jail for it also. I almost killed people.

0:07:29.420,0:07:33.880
So you are saying that the spirit of anger was such a strong spirit

0:07:33.880,0:07:37.840
that it caused you to do things to the point that you ended up in jail?

0:07:37.840,0:07:38.920
Yes

0:07:38.920,0:07:47.860
So when you came to The SCOAN, we understand that during the service of the man of God,

0:07:47.860,0:07:51.800
Prophet T.B. Joshua, that he actually came over to you and he said something to you.

0:07:51.800,0:07:54.560
Can you just tell us, what did the Prophet say to you?

0:07:54.560,0:07:57.720
He said that I am your friend, you don't have to be scared.

0:07:57.720,0:08:05.800
Because when I came into the church, I felt a very big power of God and I tried to hide from it

0:08:05.800,0:08:09.920
because I thought God wanted to judge me or something like that.

0:08:09.920,0:08:16.040
Brother, don't run from me. God loves you. Give me your hand.

0:08:16.040,0:08:20.080
You will come to the prayer line today. I will see you there.

0:08:20.080,0:08:21.120
OK?

0:08:21.120,0:08:27.220
I will see you. I am your friend. Please don't run from me. I love you.

0:08:27.220,0:08:29.560
He says he is scared.

0:08:29.560,0:08:30.540
You are scared?

0:08:30.540,0:08:31.340
Yes.

0:08:31.340,0:08:46.620
What is disturbing him is mine is positive, his own is negative and I want to deliver him.

0:08:46.620,0:08:48.380
That’s correct.

0:08:48.380,0:08:50.160
It's true.

0:08:50.160,0:08:54.280
When your life is controlled by demons,

0:08:54.280,0:09:01.940
it is not easy to describe or explain when something takes control of you.

0:09:01.940,0:09:11.880
I was pushed to digging up graves, to dig up the coffins and open them.

0:09:11.880,0:09:19.280
It's difficult to explain because it was something inside of me that controlled my life.

0:09:19.280,0:09:24.020
So you are saying that the demons in your life controlled you to such an effect

0:09:24.020,0:09:29.900
that it would cause you to dig up graves, go to the graveyard, attack people and do all sorts of evil.

0:09:29.900,0:09:31.460
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

0:09:31.460,0:09:36.860
So you came to The SCOAN - we will just bring you back to what happened during the service.

0:09:36.860,0:09:41.700
After the man of God met you and said do not be afraid,

0:09:41.700,0:09:46.800
we understand that the same day you were arranged in the prayer line.

0:09:46.800,0:09:50.460
Can you just tell us what was your experience at the prayer line.

0:09:50.460,0:09:55.060
What was actually going through your mind at the time and just tell us how you were feeling?

0:09:55.060,0:10:02.920
Well, the night before that I slept so bad because I knew something was going to happen.

0:10:02.920,0:10:09.240
Something controlled my body again and I became so angry and I wanted to attack him.

0:10:09.240,0:10:17.840
It was a miracle because I grabbed the chair and I actually wanted to hit him with it.

0:10:17.860,0:10:22.840
I also wanted to kick him but there was a power that stopped me.

0:10:22.840,0:10:29.000
When he was doing like this, a power came over me and I fell down.

0:10:29.000,0:10:32.860
Normally for me that is not normal because I am strong enough.

0:10:32.860,0:10:47.480
But then I fell down on the ground and a very big peace came over me

0:10:47.480,0:10:52.980
and something in me at that moment was coming out of me and now it's gone.

0:10:52.980,0:10:56.000
Oh hallelujah, clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:10:56.000,0:11:00.500
Testimony Time

0:11:00.500,0:11:05.580
So you were wonderfully, fantastically delivered in the power of the Holy Spirit

0:11:05.580,0:11:07.520
by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:11:07.520,0:11:09.260
So how do you feel now?

0:11:09.260,0:11:12.340
You said you have a wonderful peace that has come over you.

0:11:12.340,0:11:17.040
How do you feel in your mind now, in your body? How are you feeling right now?

0:11:17.040,0:11:28.240
I am feeling very very quiet. Peaceful, and not a feeling of becoming angry anymore, not at all.

0:11:28.240,0:11:31.940
And are you hearing any voices anymore to tell you to do what you used to do?

0:11:31.940,0:11:33.920
No no, not anymore, Jesus set me free.

0:11:33.920,0:11:39.280
Oh hallelujah, clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:11:39.380,0:11:44.020
So Jesus Christ has completely delivered you and set you free, we thank God.

0:11:44.020,0:11:51.000
Let's clap for Jesus Christ once again for that wonderful healing, wonderful deliverance.

0:11:51.000,0:11:54.420
At last I want to say one last thing.

0:11:54.420,0:12:01.460
It is a nightmare when your whole life is controlled by violent nature.

0:12:01.460,0:12:05.560
And satan, I want to tell you now, I am free, God set me free.

0:12:05.560,0:12:09.600
Oh hallelujah!

0:12:09.600,0:12:10.780
Amen.

0:12:10.780,0:12:13.180
Testimony Time

0:12:13.180,0:12:19.220
So now that Jesus Christ has completely delivered you and set you free, you are now peaceful.

0:12:19.220,0:12:21.260
What is your promise to Him?

0:12:21.260,0:12:23.340
I want to serve God.

0:12:23.340,0:12:24.620
Amen!

0:12:24.620,0:12:28.500
Well, we pray with you that God will give you that special grace to do just that

0:12:28.500,0:12:32.020
and to go and sin no more, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

0:12:32.020,0:12:32.720
Amen.

0:12:32.720,0:12:39.480
Thank you very much. Clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again.

0:12:39.480,0:12:43.040
After testifying to the goodness of God in his life,

0:12:43.040,0:12:47.280
Martien prepares to return to Holland to live his life anew.

0:12:47.280,0:12:50.740
Just before he goes, he shares his experience one more time

0:12:50.740,0:12:57.740
I feel happy inside and since Sunday, I have become very very sensitive.

0:12:57.740,0:13:02.320
Since several times, I had to cry cry cry, it's the love of God.

0:13:02.320,0:13:04.700
I cannot explain it but I am happy.

0:13:04.700,0:13:10.200
I feel that something has come out of me; I have no feelings of anger again.

0:13:10.200,0:13:13.580
It's real; it's not fake.

0:13:13.580,0:13:22.560
When the rest of the Holy Spirit came over me, you could see I was knocked down on the ground

0:13:22.560,0:13:26.120
but with peace, peace in my heart.

0:13:26.120,0:13:32.220
It was really a touch of God on me.

0:13:32.220,0:13:36.880
Otherwise, if the prophet was not really a man of God,

0:13:36.880,0:13:40.260
I would have knocked him down; I can tell you that.

0:13:40.260,0:13:44.520
He is a man of God. I have never seen a man like him.

0:13:44.520,0:13:50.960
I have visited so many churches in Holland but I never saw power like this.

0:13:50.960,0:13:53.640
It is a very big expression.

0:13:53.640,0:13:55.240
He is really a man of God.

0:13:55.240,0:14:01.440
One thing I have learned is to look on God, no matter how great your faith is.

0:14:01.440,0:14:07.880
You have to express your faith in God in your life and then all miracles can happen in your life.

0:14:07.880,0:14:09.820
That's what I have learned here.

0:14:09.820,0:14:10.940
That’s fantastic, sir.

0:14:10.940,0:14:13.400
We pray with you that God Almighty will give you a safe journey home

0:14:13.400,0:14:17.360
and the grace to maintain all the peace and joy you have received here, in Jesus' name.

0:14:17.360,0:14:18.400
Amen!

0:14:18.400,0:14:24.340
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
