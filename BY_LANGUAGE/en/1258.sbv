Good Morning!

0:00:02.760,0:00:07.320
What a great and wonderful God we serve!

0:00:07.320,0:00:12.020
Our God is an awesome God.

0:00:12.020,0:00:16.700
We are serving a Living God;

0:00:16.700,0:00:24.540
to His power, nothing is impossible.

0:00:24.540,0:00:27.140
He is here in our midst today.

0:00:27.140,0:00:31.260
Greet Him. Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

0:00:31.260,0:00:35.360
He is indeed the Living God.

0:00:35.360,0:00:37.700
Praise the Lord!

0:00:37.700,0:00:40.960
You may be seated. Have your seat in His presence.

My name is Racine.

0:00:45.800,0:00:52.280
I'm here today to share His message of salvation, in Jesus' name.

0:00:52.280,0:00:55.620
I say to you, "In Jesus' name".

0:00:55.620,0:00:57.420
God's Word is the key.

0:00:57.420,0:01:00.740
Let someone say, "God's Word is the key".

0:01:00.740,0:01:03.920
God has given us the way to abundant life.

0:01:03.920,0:01:10.640
The way to success, the way to good success is for you today.

0:01:10.640,0:01:13.320
So no matter what you face today,

0:01:13.320,0:01:17.940
I pray God gives you the grace to listen to this message.

0:01:17.940,0:01:21.060
This message I have received from the teaching of the man of God.

0:01:21.060,0:01:24.280
By the time you listen to this message and apply it,

0:01:24.280,0:01:27.060
you will know that the way out for you has come.

0:01:27.060,0:01:31.960
Say, "The way out for me has come".

0:01:31.960,0:01:34.880
Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:34.880,0:01:43.540
Brethren, there are many questionable conversions today.

0:01:43.540,0:01:52.760
Many are merely convinced but not yet converted.

0:01:52.760,0:01:58.140
You can know if one's conversion is questionable;

0:01:58.140,0:02:04.040
you can know when the man cannot act on the Word of God.

0:02:04.040,0:02:28.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:28.340,0:02:39.000
Mental assent recognises the truthfulness of the Word of God but cannot act on the Word.

0:02:39.000,0:02:46.420
There is a difference between knowing about God and knowing God.

0:02:46.420,0:03:00.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:00.660,0:03:09.040
One can be convinced that Jesus is the Son of God and still never find Jesus.

0:03:09.040,0:03:17.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:17.540,0:03:21.920
Say, "Neighbour, listen to the Word of God".

0:03:21.920,0:03:25.740
In His Word - salvation.

0:03:25.740,0:03:32.160
In His Word - deliverance.

0:03:32.160,0:03:37.420
Knowing the Holy Spirit is knowing God.

0:03:37.420,0:03:43.520
It is the Spirit of the Father who reveals God to us.

0:03:43.520,0:03:49.140
That is why we say, we are sons and daughters of God by revelation.

0:03:49.140,0:03:59.420
Say, "Neighbour, we are sons and daughters of God by revelation".

0:03:59.420,0:04:07.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:07.240,0:04:15.800
If one is serving God without the Holy Spirit, he is serving a god he does not know.

0:04:15.800,0:04:22.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:22.380,0:04:29.880
Say, "Neighbour, don't tell me what you feel.

0:04:29.880,0:04:32.860
Tell me what you know.

0:04:32.860,0:04:35.700
Tell me what you believe.

0:04:35.700,0:04:41.980
We are Christians by revelation".

0:04:41.980,0:04:54.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:54.400,0:04:57.700
Say, "I am a Christian by revelation".

0:04:57.700,0:05:00.380
We act in the Word,

0:05:00.380,0:05:02.620
we do the Word,

0:05:02.620,0:05:04.880
we live in the Word

0:05:04.880,0:05:11.140
and we trust implicitly in the Word of God.

0:05:11.140,0:05:22.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:22.900,0:05:32.180
Acting on the Word of God makes Jesus truly real to the believer.

0:05:32.180,0:05:37.880
Acting on the Word of God gives God the opportunity to bless you,

0:05:37.880,0:05:44.860
to heal you, to deliver you and to save you.

0:05:44.860,0:06:00.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:00.380,0:06:09.360
Say, "Neighbour, we are Christians by revelation".

0:06:09.360,0:06:12.120
The Bible says, the Christian home - put your hand on your heart -

0:06:12.120,0:06:14.600
say, "The Christian home - that home is your heart.

0:06:14.600,0:06:26.940
The Christian home is the high school of learning whereby many truths are imbibed".

0:06:26.940,0:06:34.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:34.220,0:06:48.060
The Holy Spirit is the Organ by which we apprehend spiritual things, spiritual truths.

0:06:48.060,0:06:55.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:55.980,0:07:00.420
This brings us to our message today: The Illumination of the Spirit.

0:07:00.420,0:07:04.520
Tell your neighbour, "The Illumination of the Spirit".

0:07:04.520,0:07:10.860
Say, "Neighbour, be illumined by the Spirit of God".

0:07:10.860,0:07:14.900
Turn your Bible with me to the Book of 2 Corinthians.

0:07:14.900,0:07:17.620
We start our reading from Chapter 4.

0:07:17.620,0:07:20.120
2 Corinthians 4.

0:07:20.120,0:07:24.340
I start from verse 6 to 7.

0:07:24.340,0:07:25.880
It reads:

0:07:25.880,0:07:35.240
"For it is the God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts

0:07:35.240,0:07:42.520
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."

0:07:42.520,0:07:44.020
Verse 7.

0:07:44.020,0:07:49.340
"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels,

0:07:49.340,0:07:56.320
that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."

0:07:56.320,0:08:05.260
Say, "Neighbour, the illumination of the Holy Spirit".

0:08:05.260,0:08:13.880
In the Book of Acts 19 - when you go home, you read from verse 1 to 6 -

0:08:13.880,0:08:19.980
Paul the Apostle visited the church at Ephesus

0:08:19.980,0:08:28.680
and he perceived that they were serving a god they did not know.

0:08:28.680,0:08:35.540
He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"

0:08:35.540,0:08:42.000
Because knowing Jesus is knowing the Holy Spirit.

0:08:42.000,0:09:00.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:00.700,0:09:07.760
They answered, "We have never heard that there is a Holy Spirit".

0:09:07.760,0:09:13.040
Their worship was defective.

0:09:13.040,0:09:22.480
They knew all the rites but still they did not know Jesus.

0:09:22.480,0:09:34.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:34.540,0:09:43.460
When Paul began to preach the revealing Word of God, spiritual enlightenment came.

0:09:43.460,0:09:50.240
They acted on it and the saving power of God descended on them and they were saved

0:09:50.240,0:09:55.000
and they received the baptism in the Holy Spirit.

0:09:55.000,0:10:11.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:11.500,0:10:14.180
What can we say about that today?

0:10:14.180,0:10:25.320
Brethren, the Kingdom of Light, the Kingdom of God is not something hoped for or a mere wish;

0:10:25.320,0:10:32.260
it is a fact - it is a reality.

0:10:32.260,0:10:42.460
Jesus said in Luke 17:20-22 that the Kingdom of God does not come by observation or sight

0:10:42.460,0:10:44.940
but the Kingdom of God is within you.

0:10:44.940,0:10:54.280
Say, "Neighbour, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Light is within you".

0:10:54.280,0:11:16.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:16.200,0:11:23.820
This means, the Kingdom of Light is in the Living Word within you.

0:11:23.820,0:11:31.520
Say, "Neighbour, the Kingdom of Light is in the Living Word within you".

0:11:31.520,0:11:37.500
You need to discover it.

0:11:37.500,0:11:40.180
We need to discover it.

0:11:40.180,0:11:49.280
The Scripture says, the great objects of faith are made known to us by divine revelation.

0:11:49.280,0:11:58.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:58.980,0:12:04.140
How does that revelation come?

0:12:04.140,0:12:06.700
How does it come?

0:12:06.700,0:12:10.140
Ask the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and he will tell you:

0:12:10.140,0:12:19.700
It is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to you; you have a role to play.

0:12:19.700,0:12:23.120
Say, "Neighbour, you have a role to play".

0:12:23.120,0:12:25.000
What is that role?

0:12:25.000,0:12:31.240
Me-di-ta-tion!

0:12:31.240,0:12:46.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:46.460,0:12:51.280
Are you ready for the journey?

0:12:51.280,0:12:55.740
Are you ready for the key to success?

0:12:55.740,0:13:02.240
Say, "Meditation brings revelation".

0:13:02.240,0:13:08.460
Meditation brings revelation.

0:13:08.460,0:13:18.440
Meditation in the Word of God is a visit with God.

0:13:18.440,0:13:28.720
It is when you meditate on the Word of God that the Word of God enters your heart - your spirit -

0:13:28.720,0:13:35.960
and when it does, our spirit acts on it and revelation comes.

0:13:35.960,0:13:51.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:51.440,0:13:57.440
Let someone say, "Meditation brings revelation".

0:13:57.440,0:14:06.440
The new revelation knowledge that comes from above comes by acting in the Word

0:14:06.440,0:14:11.460
and living in the Word.

0:14:11.460,0:14:17.560
Job 32:8 says that when the Holy Spirit begins to speak to our hearts,

0:14:17.560,0:14:25.100
revelation comes and changes are beginning.

0:14:25.100,0:14:34.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:34.480,0:14:47.200
The man of God says that revelation is the realisation of something not previously known.

0:14:47.200,0:14:57.000
Say, "Revelation is the realisation of something not previously known".

0:14:57.000,0:15:04.980
When you know it, you will know God's opinion about you and others.

0:15:04.980,0:15:15.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:15.300,0:15:21.080
Meditation brings revelation.

0:15:21.080,0:15:24.460
Revelation brings conviction.

0:15:24.460,0:15:32.320
Say, "Revelation brings conviction".

0:15:32.320,0:15:41.540
The Book of Romans 14:5 says, "Let everyone be convinced in his own mind".

0:15:41.540,0:15:44.360
You have heard so much about this ministry.

0:15:44.360,0:15:49.600
Many are here to see but the Bible says, "Let everyone be convinced in his own mind".

0:15:49.600,0:15:54.900
That I have the revelation that Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the Son of God,

0:15:54.900,0:16:03.020
the Saviour of the world, does not mean I can get you to believe the truth.

0:16:03.020,0:16:13.920
You must get that revelation yourself in order to believe because faith is a conviction.

0:16:13.920,0:16:27.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:27.740,0:16:32.420
Let someone say, "Faith is a conviction".

0:16:32.420,0:16:42.560
It is a trust that arises in each person's heart, based on the Word of God.

0:16:42.560,0:16:49.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:49.360,0:16:55.940
What is conviction?

0:16:55.940,0:16:58.040
The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says that

0:16:58.040,0:17:05.660
conviction is the awakening of man's conscience to the truth.

0:17:05.660,0:17:16.620
Say to yourself, "Conviction is the awakening of my conscience to the truth".

0:17:16.620,0:17:28.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:28.220,0:17:33.200
What is truth?

0:17:33.200,0:17:39.580
The Scripture says to know the truth is to know Jesus Christ.

0:17:39.580,0:17:49.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:49.060,0:17:58.140
Faith in Christ Jesus is a trust that arises out of the fact that

0:17:58.140,0:18:04.760
God is reliable, trustworthy and steadfast.

0:18:04.760,0:18:18.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:18.400,0:18:27.980
To trust means to believe the truth, to accept the truth

0:18:27.980,0:18:34.180
and be totally committed to that truth.

0:18:34.180,0:18:44.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:44.280,0:18:50.940
When you do, nothing can change your mind about what you believe.

0:18:50.940,0:18:55.900
You will remain an agent of truth in the midst of lies.

0:18:55.900,0:19:02.040
You will remain an agent of faithfulness in the midst of unfaithfulness.

0:19:02.040,0:19:07.700
You will remain a channel of humility in the face of pride.

0:19:07.700,0:19:19.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:19.600,0:19:26.200
Let someone say, "Revelation brings conviction".

0:19:26.200,0:19:32.080
This means, every time our spirit acts on the revealing Word of God,

0:19:32.080,0:19:38.540
something enters our spirit that increases our assurance - that is conviction.

0:19:38.540,0:19:45.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:45.700,0:19:47.860
Yes, I am a child of God.

0:19:47.860,0:19:51.700
I am born again. I am justified. I am redeemed.

0:19:51.700,0:19:58.140
I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

0:19:58.140,0:20:05.800
It is the development of God's Word on the inside of you by meditation

0:20:05.800,0:20:09.000
that gives birth to belief in your heart.

0:20:09.000,0:20:17.140
Say, "Neighbour, it is the development of God's Word on the inside of me

0:20:17.140,0:20:24.460
that gives birth to belief in my heart.

0:20:24.460,0:20:32.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:32.460,0:20:37.740
Say, "Faith is my movement towards God".

0:20:37.740,0:20:43.700
Mediation in the Word is a visit with God.

0:20:43.700,0:20:48.140
The more you get closer to God by meditation,

0:20:48.140,0:20:55.100
the more you begin to sense His righteousness and holiness.

0:20:55.100,0:21:06.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:06.060,0:21:12.160
Brethren, meditation brings revelation.

0:21:12.160,0:21:15.480
Revelation brings conviction.

0:21:15.480,0:21:27.680
Conviction brings real movement.

0:21:27.680,0:21:34.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:34.500,0:21:43.440
Conviction leads to a heart decision, which leads to real movement.

0:21:43.440,0:21:51.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:51.680,0:21:52.940
What do I mean by that?

0:21:52.940,0:21:57.860
The Bible says, when we move, power steps.

0:21:57.860,0:22:07.720
Say, "When I step, power steps - the power of God - with intent and purpose".

0:22:07.720,0:22:17.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:17.000,0:22:18.940
How can this happen?

0:22:18.940,0:22:26.600
Let someone say, "God Almighty is with us in the Living Word".

0:22:26.600,0:22:29.140
Say, "Emmanuel!

0:22:29.140,0:22:31.400
God with me!

0:22:31.400,0:22:33.500
Emmanuel!

0:22:33.500,0:22:35.500
God with me!"

0:22:35.500,0:22:40.660
The Living God is with us in the Living Word.

0:22:40.660,0:22:52.620
This means, every step we take, we step in the presence of God.

0:22:52.620,0:23:00.220
Every look I take, I look with the power of God.

0:23:00.220,0:23:07.780
Every movement I take, I move with the Kingdom of God.

0:23:07.780,0:23:28.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:28.840,0:23:37.120
Say, "Neighbour, when I move, power moves".

0:23:37.120,0:23:42.440
To stay with Jesus Christ of Nazareth is to stay with the Holy Spirit -

0:23:42.440,0:23:47.840
there lies our safety.

0:23:47.840,0:23:57.060
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:57.060,0:24:02.700
Meditation brings revelation.

0:24:02.700,0:24:06.080
Revelation brings conviction.

0:24:06.080,0:24:11.480
Conviction brings real movement.

0:24:11.480,0:24:16.460
Now to illustrate this process, let's go to the Bible.

0:24:16.460,0:24:29.240
In the Book of Acts 10:9-19, the Bible says there was a man called Cornelius.

0:24:29.240,0:24:33.680
He had a divine appointment with God -

0:24:33.680,0:24:40.580
a divine appointment with salvation, with righteousness of God

0:24:40.580,0:24:48.140
but God does nothing without His Word.

0:24:48.140,0:24:55.460
So, God chose Simon Peter to be the one to deliver the message of righteousness

0:24:55.460,0:25:00.460
to the household of Cornelius.

Peter, being a Jew, had no interaction with gentiles.

0:25:29.880,0:25:36.780
He never went to the house of a gentile, so God gave him a vision of revelation.

0:25:36.780,0:25:39.140
Read from verse 10 to 11.

0:25:39.140,0:25:46.560
God showed him all sorts of impure animals and said, "Peter, kill and eat".

0:25:46.560,0:25:50.240
Peter said, "Lord, I have never eaten anything impure".

0:25:50.240,0:25:56.360
God said, "Don't call impure what I call pure".

0:25:56.360,0:26:05.120
He resisted the vision three times because Peter could not understand the vision.

0:26:31.420,0:26:39.420
Brethren, say, "Meditation brings revelation".

0:26:39.420,0:26:52.020
Verse 19 says when Peter was busy thinking over the vision, meditating on the vision,

0:26:52.020,0:26:55.860
the Bible says revelation came.

0:26:55.860,0:27:00.600
The Spirit of God spoke to him and said to him,

0:27:00.600,0:27:06.780
'Go with them; doubt nothing. I am the One that sent them'.

0:27:06.780,0:27:10.560
That meditation brought revelation;

0:27:10.560,0:27:14.340
that revelation brought to Peter conviction that this is the will of God.

0:27:14.340,0:27:16.920
Then, he took a real movement.

0:27:16.920,0:27:20.700
Peter stepped out with boldness and went to the house of Cornelius -

0:27:20.700,0:27:23.740
obedience to the Word of God.

0:27:23.740,0:27:29.440
The Bible says when he came, he preached the Word of salvation

0:27:29.440,0:27:32.980
and the power of God came on all the household.

0:27:32.980,0:27:37.240
And the Bible says they were saved.

0:28:08.200,0:28:17.360
What lesson can we learn from Peter's experience for us today?

0:28:17.360,0:28:26.680
No one can obey the written Word without the help of the Holy Spirit.

0:28:26.680,0:28:33.460
Human nature, the natural man, the man of the mind and intellect

0:28:33.460,0:28:36.780
cannot understand or receive the things of the Holy Ghost

0:28:36.780,0:28:41.740
because they are spiritually discerned.

0:28:41.740,0:28:49.620
So, our earthly understanding must give way to spiritual enlightenment.

0:28:49.620,0:29:08.940

0:29:08.940,0:29:14.180
Neighbour, I don't know what your problem is this morning.

0:29:14.180,0:29:16.720
I don't know what brought you today.

0:29:16.720,0:29:21.980
But all I know, God is still saying something.

0:29:21.980,0:29:28.860
No matter how dark your situation is, God is saying something!

0:29:28.860,0:29:35.240

0:29:35.240,0:29:38.800
Finally, brethren.

0:29:38.800,0:29:47.420
If our faith is to be a 'New Testament faith',

0:29:47.420,0:29:58.560
if Christ Jesus is to be the Christ of God rather than the Christ of history - baby Jesus,

0:29:58.560,0:30:02.520
then the illumination of the Spirit will tell in your heart

0:30:02.520,0:30:09.760
that you are learning at the feet of Jesus, not at the feet of man.

0:30:09.760,0:30:27.440

0:30:27.440,0:30:35.960
Christianity stands or falls on Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

0:30:35.960,0:30:42.720
Christianity stands or falls on the illumination of the Holy Spirit.

0:30:42.720,0:30:47.160
No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!" unless he is guided by the Holy Spirit.

0:30:47.160,0:31:01.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:01.400,0:31:07.500
Say, "Neighbour, the way out for you has come.

0:31:07.500,0:31:13.840
Neighbour, the way to a successful prayer life has come.

0:31:13.840,0:31:17.460
The key to revelation has come.

0:31:17.460,0:31:20.660
The key to conviction has come.

0:31:20.660,0:31:24.480
The key to the step of faith has come".

0:31:24.480,0:31:33.900
No matter what you are experiencing here today, don't panic; run to God.

0:31:33.900,0:31:37.260
Run to God!

0:31:37.260,0:31:43.020
No matter how dark the situation you are experiencing today in your life,

0:31:43.020,0:31:50.340
home, business, career, engage your heart with God.

0:31:50.340,0:32:00.960
The Bible says if the answers to your prayers are not given, hold on and hold out

0:32:00.960,0:32:09.500
'til you receive revelation, understanding from God.

0:32:09.500,0:32:39.200

0:32:39.200,0:32:51.600
Say, "Neighbour, meditate 'til God Almighty gives you a clear light".

0:32:51.600,0:32:56.400
When the illumination of the Spirit comes into your life and situation,

0:32:56.400,0:33:00.400
you will know the power you are under.

0:33:00.400,0:33:05.300
You will know God's opinion about yourself and others.

0:33:05.300,0:33:10.320
You will know God's opinion on the matter, why God allowed the things to happen -

0:33:10.320,0:33:14.980
to bring a greater revelation in your life.

0:33:14.980,0:33:22.600
Meditation brings revelation; revelation brings results.

0:33:22.600,0:33:45.780

0:33:45.780,0:33:48.880
Now, brethren, this is my word.

0:33:48.880,0:33:51.440
Can you stand up in His presence.

0:33:51.440,0:33:54.920
Can you stand up in the presence of God.

0:33:54.920,0:34:01.180
Say, "I am a Christian by revelation.

0:34:01.180,0:34:05.800
I know I am serving the Living God.

0:34:05.800,0:34:17.320
You situation, trouble - you want to blacken, darken but let me tell you,

0:34:17.320,0:34:23.160
beyond that situation lies God's purpose for my life.

0:34:23.160,0:34:27.960
I know the way out for me has come.

0:34:27.960,0:34:32.080
Today, I am in the presence of the Almighty God.

0:34:32.080,0:34:37.980
You situation, I refuse to obey.

0:34:37.980,0:34:43.220
I know my God is greater than you".

0:34:43.220,0:34:50.500
Today, when you apply the message, mediation brings revelation.

0:34:50.500,0:34:53.020
Say, "God dwells in my heart.

0:34:53.020,0:35:01.160
Meditation brings conviction; conviction brings real movement.

0:35:01.160,0:35:04.040
I take a step of faith.

0:35:04.040,0:35:14.080
I will not draw back; I will move on and on because victory is mine!"

0:35:14.080,0:35:15.520
God bless His Word!
