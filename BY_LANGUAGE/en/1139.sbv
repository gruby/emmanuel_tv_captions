Begin to find those areas you need to surrender;

0:00:03.380,0:00:06.480
areas you need to confess in your life.

0:00:06.480,0:00:12.400
You know yourself more than anyone because what is about to happen

0:00:12.400,0:00:16.220
is destined for you to be free.

0:00:16.220,0:00:21.940
Yes, I am very sure you'll be released today.

0:00:21.940,0:00:27.020
You will begin to count your blessings after this prayer.

0:00:27.020,0:00:33.200
Tell your neighbor, "I will begin to count my blessings after this prayer".

0:00:33.200,0:00:35.180
Halleluyah!

0:00:35.180,0:00:47.880
Viewers all over the world, be ready to begin to count your blessings after the prayer.

0:00:47.880,0:00:56.040
Whatever medium you are using to view us, it is the will of God to bless you.

0:00:56.040,0:00:59.700
I say, it is the will of God to heal you.

0:00:59.700,0:01:02.840
It is his way to deliver you.

0:01:02.840,0:01:03.960
You know that?

0:01:03.960,0:01:04.860
[Yes.]

0:01:04.860,0:01:09.720
Okay, begin to show that faith, that belief.

0:01:09.720,0:01:15.940
So if you believe that, you begin to confess your blessing, your breakthrough.

0:01:15.940,0:01:19.840
Whilst you are waiting to receive, confess it.

0:01:19.840,0:01:24.960
Whilst I'm waiting to receive the blessing, I say, "Thank You Jesus, I am blessed".

0:01:24.960,0:01:27.100
That is the heart of faith.

0:01:27.100,0:01:29.040
Father, we thank You.

0:01:29.040,0:01:31.520

0:01:39.220,0:01:41.360

0:01:41.360,0:01:43.760
Say, "I am welcome."

0:01:43.760,0:01:48.320
"I'm conscious that I'm welcome."

0:01:48.320,0:01:50.460
Say, "I'm welcome."

0:01:50.460,0:01:55.520
I say, "I am welcome."

0:01:55.520,0:01:58.760
Father, we thank You.

0:01:58.760,0:02:07.900
What can hinder you or stop you in the presence of God?

0:02:07.900,0:02:08.920
I canÂ´t hear you.

0:02:08.920,0:02:10.320
[Nothing!]

0:02:10.320,0:02:17.060
Say to yourself, "What can stop me in the presence of God?

0:02:17.060,0:02:20.920
Because His presence is mighty.

0:02:20.920,0:02:31.020
What can stop my blessing? What can stop my healing in the presence of Jesus?"

0:02:31.020,0:02:38.540
Jesus!

0:02:38.540,0:02:45.280
I surrender!

0:19:58.400,0:20:06.400
You just confess that affliction you have; confess that disease you have.

0:20:06.400,0:20:14.160
Yours is to confess and believe. Jesus is to heal.

0:25:14.040,0:25:17.620
Mean it - it is over!

0:25:17.620,0:25:20.940
From your heart - it is over!

0:25:30.260,0:25:32.300
It is over.

0:25:32.300,0:25:35.320
When Jesus says, "It is over"...

0:25:35.320,0:25:39.380
I said when Jesus says, "It is over"...

0:25:39.380,0:25:42.360
The word I'm saying is not mine.

0:25:42.360,0:25:45.500
The word you hear from me is not mine.

0:25:45.500,0:25:51.740
I'm just a vessel; I'm just being used.

0:25:51.740,0:25:55.400
When Jesus says, "It is over", it is over!

0:25:55.400,0:25:59.520
I say, when Jesus says, "It is over", it is over!

0:25:59.520,0:26:02.720
Do you want to hear, "It is over!" from Jesus?

0:26:02.720,0:26:05.420
It is over!

That should be your language.

Right now, it is possible that you may not believe yourself but believe Jesus.

0:28:05.960,0:28:15.260
because you are still feeling some slight, strange pain.

Because you want me to tell you to rejoice before you rejoice.

0:29:21.940,0:29:24.220
I have a way of telling you.

0:29:24.220,0:29:29.540
I know you because you don't believe yourself but you believe Jesus.

0:29:29.540,0:29:33.420
You don't believe yourself but you believe Jesus.

That is the message I hear.

0:30:05.740,0:30:07.300
I was hearing breakthrough.

0:30:07.300,0:30:12.380

When Jesus says, "You are blessed", you are blessed.

0:30:56.720,0:31:01.880
Jesus is not a man that lies.

0:31:51.060,0:31:54.920
Take this word as you are going now.

0:31:54.920,0:31:59.520
The word with you is: "It is over!"

0:31:59.520,0:32:02.880
- And who said, "It is over!"?
- Jesus!

0:32:02.880,0:32:06.900
- And when Jesus says, "It is over!"
- It is over!

0:32:06.900,0:32:10.200
So take it. Continue to meditate over this.

0:32:10.200,0:32:14.860
When you hear anything strange like the message we preached today -

0:32:14.860,0:32:20.260
that you don't need to look far to find Him, you do not lie.

0:32:20.260,0:32:23.320
You don't need to look far.

0:32:23.320,0:32:25.180
Ah, you see it.

0:32:25.180,0:32:28.880
You look here and see economic oppression.

0:32:28.880,0:32:32.460
Here political oppression.

0:32:32.460,0:32:37.140
Everywhere religios oppression. So everywhere.

0:32:37.140,0:32:41.000
How do we react to this matter?

0:32:41.000,0:32:47.720
It is not that oppression now, but the way you react to it; sometimes, our reaction can lead to sin.

0:32:47.720,0:32:51.260
Can lead to what?
Sin.

0:32:51.260,0:32:54.780
When you say, "Oh, why are you doing this?

0:32:54.780,0:32:56.780
You are committing sin again.

0:32:56.780,0:32:59.800
You believe you are doing the right thing whereas you are committing sin.

0:32:59.800,0:33:02.720
Because the way you react to an issue matters.

0:33:02.720,0:33:06.480
Not that issue but the manner you react to it matters.

0:33:06.480,0:33:17.180
Let us be known as people who are for good, not just against the bad.

0:33:17.180,0:33:19.300
So take that message home.

0:33:19.300,0:33:23.400
This is my message to you today.

0:33:23.400,0:33:30.280
I want to leave you by saying, "It is over!"

You have seen that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:37:26.800,0:37:31.240

Channel of shining light.

0:39:41.180,0:39:48.180
Out there, there is darkness and you are a shining light.

0:39:48.180,0:39:55.200
DonÂ´t forget your promise to God: You are a channel.

0:39:55.200,0:40:05.440
I pray you remain a channel of God where there is darkness.

0:40:05.440,0:40:11.620
Where there is injury, you remain a channel of pardon.

0:40:11.620,0:40:20.220
Where there is sin, you remain a channel of forgiveness.

0:40:20.220,0:40:25.660
Where there is hate, you remain a channel of love.

0:40:25.660,0:40:27.440
In Jesus Christ's name.

0:40:27.440,0:40:28.240
[Amen!]

0:40:28.240,0:40:29.600
I canÂ´t hear you..

0:40:29.600,0:40:32.940
[Amen!]

0:40:32.940,0:40:35.720
Halleluyah!

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:40:40.340,0:40:43.780
DonÂ´t forget whom you are.

0:40:43.780,0:40:47.960
I said, donÂ´t forget whom you are.

0:40:47.960,0:40:51.360
There is an area that you have to take home.

0:40:51.360,0:41:02.400
We are going to make mistakes because there is no one righteous, not even one.

0:41:02.400,0:41:16.900
When you do, you must think about what you did.

0:41:16.900,0:41:20.500
That is, to examine your life.

0:41:20.500,0:41:27.100
It's a good thing.

0:41:27.100,0:41:38.000
Reflect and ask yourself, "Is this the kind of person I want to be?

0:41:38.000,0:41:41.540
A liar? A thief? A killer?"

0:41:41.540,0:41:49.560
Whatever you might have done, ask and examine yourself.

0:41:49.560,0:41:56.260
That is the special gift given to you, we call it 'discretion'.

0:41:56.260,0:42:01.340
"Oh no, this is not right. This is right."

0:42:01.340,0:42:03.880
Don't forget that.

0:42:03.880,0:42:08.140
Tell your neighbour, "Examine yourself.

0:42:08.140,0:42:14.160
"Examine your life - it's a good thing".

0:42:14.160,0:42:15.520
I canÂ´t hear you..

0:42:15.520,0:42:19.640
[Examine your life - it's a good thing.]

0:42:19.640,0:42:23.960
Before you pray, when you wake up in the morning,

0:42:23.960,0:42:30.880
before you offer prayer to God, because God is God of justice,

0:42:30.880,0:42:35.400
sit down and examine your life.

0:42:35.400,0:42:40.760
Where you missed the mark - when you are not right and when you are right.

0:42:40.760,0:42:47.060
So that you can say, "Ah, I'm sorry, this is what I have done. I promised and I failed".

0:42:47.060,0:42:52.700
After that, you can now say, "Jesus! My Lord Jesus!"

0:42:52.700,0:42:56.760
If you don't examine your life before you pray, you are not praying to God -

0:42:56.760,0:42:58.740
you are praying to yourself.

0:42:58.740,0:43:03.860
Tell your neighbour, "If you have not examined yourself before you pray,

0:43:03.860,0:43:12.840
you are praying of yourself; you are saying words, not praying prayers.

0:43:12.840,0:43:16.180
When you wake up in the morning, before you pray, sit on your bed and

0:43:16.180,0:43:20.520
examine yourself, "What have I done? What happened?

0:43:20.520,0:43:23.900
This man promised me; I promised this one and failed. Oh, Lord Jesus".

0:43:23.900,0:43:27.980
You say to yourself, "I'm sorry" before you begin to pray.

0:43:27.980,0:43:31.180
That will guide you what to pray for.

0:43:31.180,0:43:33.520
You need a guide to pray.

0:43:33.520,0:43:38.120
If you don't have a guide to pray and you just wake up - whom are you praying to?

0:43:38.120,0:43:40.100
So please, thank you very much.
