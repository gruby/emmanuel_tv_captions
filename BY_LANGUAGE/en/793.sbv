0:00:00.000,0:00:05.730
Good Morning, brethren!

0:00:05.730,0:00:14.429
Emmanuel! Emmanuel! I am Nosakhare Ogiebor Okunbor.

0:00:14.429,0:00:18.660
I am a businessman and a politician.

0:00:18.660,0:00:23.970
I am a Nigerian based in Benin.

0:00:23.970,0:00:32.460
The person by my side is my younger brother ,

0:00:32.460,0:00:36.100
I am an independent marketer of liquefied petroleum gas,

0:00:36.100,0:00:39.329
popularly called cooking gas.

0:00:39.329,0:00:48.900
It all happened on the 20th of February this year.

0:00:48.900,0:00:54.329
I hired a truck.

0:00:54.329,0:01:06.210
It was loaded with 35 thousand litres of  LPG, cooking gas - that is 20 metric tons.

0:01:06.210,0:01:16.700
The truck left Lagos for Benin and arrived to Benin at about 10pm.

0:01:16.770,0:01:19.890
They called me and said that the truck must be discharged that night.

0:01:19.890,0:01:23.850
I said it is not possible to discharge LPG that night.

0:01:23.850,0:01:30.150
Moreover my workers and the technical officers

0:01:30.150,0:01:32.280
they've all gone home,

0:01:32.280,0:01:35.490
that it will be discharged in the morning.

0:01:35.490,0:01:43.500
Let me explain this: at one o'clock in the morning one of my trucks has went to Enugu

0:01:43.500,0:01:47.900
for upgrade of the safety valve - it almost got burnt on his way to Benin.

0:01:47.970,0:01:53.500
The driver called me at about six minutes after one o'clock

0:01:53.500,0:01:59.189
to say that my truck caught fire, that they were able to put it down.

0:01:59.189,0:02:02.700
Five hours later at about six o'clock

0:02:02.700,0:02:06.570
when I woke up

0:02:06.570,0:02:10.140
I called one of my managers: "Where are you?"

0:02:10.140,0:02:13.379
He said he was at the gate of my gas plant.

0:02:13.379,0:02:16.200
I said: "Please, if you are discharging be very careful,

0:02:16.260,0:02:20.600
considering what happened about five hours ago."

0:02:20.600,0:02:23.370
I left my apartment, I came out.

0:02:23.370,0:02:34.800
Within 10 minutes I received a call, distress call: "Gas everywhere!"

0:02:34.830,0:02:36.840
I said: "What is happening?"

0:02:36.840,0:02:41.300
Before I knew what was happening, the call went off.

0:02:41.300,0:02:46.800
Another one came again: "Gas!" This time they said: "Fire!"

0:02:46.860,0:02:53.000
I said: "My God!" I screamed. My wife, my children, everybody came out.

0:02:53.000,0:03:02.900
I ran into my bedroom and collected my Morning Water and came out.

0:03:02.900,0:03:07.300
I faced the direction of my gas plant...

0:03:07.300,0:03:17.000
I said: "Son of God, manifest Yourself and destroy the work of devil."

0:03:17.000,0:03:24.030
My children ran...

0:03:24.030,0:03:26.250
So right there in your house you ministered the Morning Water

0:03:26.250,0:03:28.440
in the direction of your gas plant?

0:03:28.440,0:03:31.799
I ministered the Morning Water

0:03:31.799,0:03:35.220
towards the direction of my gas plant!

0:03:35.220,0:03:40.410
Then my children came out, ran into one vehicle.

0:03:40.410,0:03:43.470
May God be praised, my His Name be blessed!

0:03:43.470,0:03:48.100
My daughter's marriage introduction was to be the next day,

0:03:48.100,0:03:49.769
that is on the 21st.

0:03:49.769,0:03:52.900
My birthday was on the 22nd.

0:03:52.900,0:03:56.700
And this thing happened on the 20th.

0:03:56.700,0:04:04.000
So we ran into the vehicle, two of us went towards the fire brigade,

0:04:04.000,0:04:08.670
and I went in the direction of my gas plant,

0:04:08.670,0:04:13.900
which is about some kilometres away from my house.

0:04:13.900,0:04:18.100
When I got to UniBank gate...Those people who know Benin very well...

0:04:18.100,0:04:24.400
When I got to UniBank gate, I called some of my workers,

0:04:24.400,0:04:27.540
and they said that no fire shed

0:04:27.540,0:04:40.000
but the whole area was charged with gas.

0:04:40.000,0:04:40.980
I run down and on getting to the place -

0:04:40.980,0:04:44.910
vehicles were still passing,

0:04:44.910,0:04:48.870
even in the thick of gas - vehicles were still passing.

0:04:48.870,0:04:55.290
Which is dangerous. LPG is highly flammable.

0:04:55.290,0:05:03.100
So we tried to stop vehicles. It's a very busy road - Benin-Lagos express way.

0:05:03.100,0:05:05.700
We succeeded in stopping the vehicles

0:05:05.700,0:05:14.100
before police, road safety, soldiers from supply and transport at division -

0:05:14.190,0:05:20.000
it is about three kilometres away from a plant.

0:05:20.000,0:05:22.700
They came and helped us to stop the vehicles.

0:05:22.700,0:05:27.000
No vehicle this time. We are moving.

0:05:27.000,0:05:29.940
Sorry sir, when you arrived at the gas plant,

0:05:29.940,0:05:35.400
can you describe the scene that you saw? What did you see at that point?

0:05:35.490,0:05:41.580
Praise Master Jesus!

0:05:41.580,0:05:45.600
The place was charged!  Here on the board.

0:05:45.600,0:05:51.200
I took this picture after about two hours

0:05:51.200,0:05:57.480
from this electric pole to the last fence...

0:05:57.480,0:06:02.220
It is about 500 fit from Benin-Lagos express way.

0:06:02.220,0:06:08.670
The whole compound was charged with gas.

0:06:08.670,0:06:14.700
What you are seeing here is not snow. This is gas, cooking gas.

0:06:14.700,0:06:16.650
So the roads - they were all charged.

0:06:16.650,0:06:25.700
And when gas escaped... Because it is the vapor goes further than the gas itself

0:06:25.700,0:06:31.400
and the vapor is the most dangerous. It can pick fire from anywhere.

0:06:31.470,0:06:36.330
But  nothing happened!

0:06:36.330,0:06:38.350
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:06:38.350,0:06:43.240
Now, sir, we know that you are working in this industry

0:06:43.240,0:06:46.600
but for the benefit of those of us present here and viewers all over the world.

0:06:46.600,0:06:50.200
We want to understand that the seriousness of this situation -

0:06:50.260,0:06:55.000
if not for divine intervention -

0:06:55.000,0:06:57.490
if such a situation occurred what would have happened?

0:06:57.490,0:07:08.100
If not for the God of TB Joshua - the disaster is unimaginable...

0:07:09.100,0:07:20.000
5 kg of cylinders can bring down a building, talkless of 35 000 liters.

0:07:20.020,0:07:28.540
That is 20 metric tons that is worse than a bomb.

0:07:28.540,0:07:36.100
It can "pfff..." the whole area. What happened in there, would have been a child's play.

0:07:36.190,0:07:39.300
It would have been more than about three hundred people that would have died that morning

0:07:39.340,0:07:48.400
because close by we have a school and houses around that area.

0:07:48.400,0:07:51.400
Millions of naira - if not billions - would have been lost.

0:07:51.400,0:08:00.100
Within my compound, within my gas plant I have about three new trucks.

0:08:00.130,0:08:05.900
A gas tank is covered so that can take three hundred thousand liters...

0:08:05.900,0:08:12.800
That is about 169 metric tons.

0:08:12.880,0:08:17.500
Wow! So what you're trying to say, sir, is that in any other situation

0:08:17.500,0:08:21.100
any little thing would have sparked a fire in that situation

0:08:21.190,0:08:24.500
which would have led to hundreds of lives being lost

0:08:24.500,0:08:29.200
and property worth billions being destroyed?

0:08:29.200,0:08:41.200
You're right. Even shoe nail can spark fire and that will be end of the investment

0:08:41.200,0:08:49.400
and so many people would have been killed and houses burnt down.

0:08:49.420,0:08:54.800
Wow, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:08:54.800,0:08:58.329
This is indeed a mother of miracles.

0:08:58.329,0:09:02.000
And, sir, in your testimony you referenced a similar incident

0:09:02.019,0:09:03.970
that happened earlier that you talked about.

0:09:03.970,0:09:08.300
I mean just for people to understand how serious this was  -

0:09:08.320,0:09:10.389
what actually happened in that case compared to

0:09:10.389,0:09:13.329
what would have happened in your own?

0:09:13.329,0:09:19.700
My explanation is that I am an Emmanuel TV partner.

0:09:19.700,0:09:26.200
Every morning I use Morning Water in my company.

0:09:26.290,0:09:36.300
Everywhere you have the sticker, every spiritual material from this great church...

0:09:36.399,0:09:41.900
Synagogue Church Of All Nations... I have it all around my compound!

0:09:41.900,0:09:45.800
It is the handwork of God Almighty.

0:09:45.800,0:09:51.800
If not - the story would have been different.

0:09:51.800,0:09:56.600
Nothing, no single pin got burnt in my plant.

0:09:56.600,0:09:59.900
The only thing lost was the liquid.

0:09:59.900,0:10:07.500
Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:10:07.500,0:10:10.200
And what you're saying, sir, is similar incidents

0:10:10.269,0:10:15.300
that happened in the past with other companies or gas plants -

0:10:15.300,0:10:19.060
not even to the volume of the gas that actually escaped in your own case -

0:10:19.060,0:10:23.500
what will happen in those cases?

0:10:23.500,0:10:29.110
A certain newspaper report said that more than hundred people died.

0:10:29.110,0:10:33.399
It is not even up to the leakage from that place,

0:10:33.399,0:10:40.300
it's not up to thirty percent of what happened in my plant.

0:10:40.300,0:10:46.800
Well, so we can really see what Jesus Christ has done in the life of our father here

0:10:46.870,0:10:49.000
through ministering the Morning Water,

0:10:49.000,0:10:52.000
how God rescued the lives of hundreds,

0:10:52.000,0:10:56.900
and what would have been such a serious explosion that would have happened

0:10:56.980,0:10:58.839
as a result of this gas leakage.

0:10:58.839,0:11:02.300
So can you just explain the other pictures that we're seeing on the board here,

0:11:02.320,0:11:04.270
apart from the one you explained earlier.

0:11:04.270,0:11:09.500
This is the hired truck. This is the discharge hose.

0:11:09.500,0:11:16.800
When you want to discharge, you tie a flexible hose to the truck

0:11:16.870,0:11:22.570
and tie the other end to the tank.

0:11:22.570,0:11:31.500
When the driver of this hired truck tied off the flange,

0:11:31.500,0:11:33.010
he used just two nuts.

0:11:33.010,0:11:36.970
You can see from this place - just small.

0:11:36.970,0:11:41.800
He supposed to use a long long one but he didn't.

0:11:41.800,0:11:51.000
As he opened the valve because of the pressure the one of the nuts gave way.

0:11:51.000,0:11:54.500
And this is the curb, you can see it from here,

0:11:54.500,0:11:58.800
where one of the nuts gave way.

0:11:58.800,0:12:02.890
This is the opening valve.

0:12:02.890,0:12:06.250
This is where the gas escaped from.

0:12:06.250,0:12:10.300
This is the truck that brought the gas to my plant.

0:12:10.300,0:12:16.500
This is from the distance I took the picture - what you are seeing here is not snow,

0:12:16.570,0:12:21.100
this is LPG, cooking gas. This is another picture.

0:12:21.100,0:12:26.300
These are houses around, the place is now fully developed.

0:12:26.350,0:12:30.910
These are houses around my company.

0:12:30.910,0:12:35.800
Well, one more time let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:35.860,0:12:37.990
We can only imagine the destruction that would have occurred,

0:12:37.990,0:12:40.180
if not for God's divine intervention.

0:12:40.180,0:12:44.500
And we thank God for this wonderful wonderful testimony.

0:12:44.560,0:12:46.510
So, sir, the light of what Jesus Christ has done -

0:12:46.510,0:12:51.100
what is your advice to viewers all over the world?

0:12:51.100,0:12:55.480
My advice is: only believe!

0:12:55.480,0:13:02.700
It is stated in John 11 that - believe and you will see the glory of God.

0:13:02.700,0:13:13.100
I want to say too that the teaching of my mentor, senior prophet TB Joshua,

0:13:13.100,0:13:21.040
came in to me, when this incident happened.

0:13:21.040,0:13:25.800
At the beginning of the year he said: "Don't take offence".

0:13:25.800,0:13:29.700
And several times he has dwelled on that issue.

0:13:29.700,0:13:36.300
This truck that brought this gas -  immediately it happened

0:13:36.300,0:13:45.400
and God saved me, washed me clean of all my iniquities and casted away my sins.

0:13:45.460,0:13:48.910
People were begging, calls from all over -

0:13:48.910,0:13:54.700
because I'm the deputy national president of all LPG marketers.

0:13:54.700,0:13:57.130
Pressures were coming that

0:13:57.130,0:14:03.700
the truck - they will pay, they will pay half, they made some different propositions.

0:14:03.730,0:14:07.360
Initially they said 20-30.

0:14:07.360,0:14:18.700
After about three days I said: "If God could forgive me and protect my property,

0:14:18.730,0:14:24.000
what millions of naira?" I went into what man of God preached

0:14:24.000,0:14:30.600
and what he stated in Matthew 18 about a king and a servant.

0:14:30.640,0:14:38.500
After three days I asked the truck driver to go without pain, cargo.

0:14:38.500,0:14:41.890
I allowed him to go.

0:14:41.890,0:14:48.800
For the company I've made a proposal that they will pay me about fifty percent of the money,

0:14:48.800,0:14:50.050
I asked them to forget about it.

0:14:50.050,0:14:55.340
God Almighty saved me, saved my company,

0:14:55.340,0:15:01.300
for that reason I have equally to forgive others too.

0:15:01.300,0:15:05.800
Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:15:05.800,0:15:08.700
We thank God, and finally they just give us a word of advice

0:15:08.710,0:15:12.700
about this Morning Water that you are holding and the Good Morning sticker -

0:15:12.760,0:15:14.890
the instruments that God really used in this situation.

0:15:14.890,0:15:23.000
What I have here - Morning Water, Good Morning Sticker -

0:15:23.000,0:15:32.500
in fact, any spiritual material from the Synagogue, Church Of All Nations -

0:15:32.500,0:15:42.200
is an atomic bomb that destroys the work of satan.

0:15:42.200,0:15:54.000
Brethren, don't play with it. Always go with your Morning Water, your Good Morning Sticker.

0:15:54.000,0:15:59.900
When you are with it - you are secured, your life is protected,

0:15:59.900,0:16:05.200
blessing, breakthrough will be your portion, in Jesus name.

0:16:05.200,0:16:09.000
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:16:09.000,0:16:14.700
We thank God Almighty for this wonderful wonderful testimony,

0:16:14.700,0:16:17.940
the divine protection that this entire gas plant received -

0:16:17.940,0:16:21.900
not just our brother and his company but even all the surrounding neighborhood

0:16:21.930,0:16:28.100
that would have been affected seriously if this incident had resulted in a fire and explosion.

0:16:28.170,0:16:31.800
We give glory to God and right now we'd like to hear a quick word from your brother as well,

0:16:31.800,0:16:33.780
who we believe was a witness to this miracle.

0:16:33.780,0:16:37.800
So, sir, if you can just introduce yourself to us and just tell us,

0:16:37.860,0:16:42.400
what can you say on your own side about this incredible testimony

0:16:42.420,0:16:44.339
that your brother has just shared.

0:16:44.339,0:16:48.060
Emmanuel! Good Morning, church! My name is Fred Ogiebor Okunbor.

0:16:48.060,0:16:52.400
It's my father and my brother.

0:16:52.400,0:16:59.500
So on this day, 28 of February we were at home.

0:16:59.550,0:17:02.220
We don't live in the same house. So he gave us a call that the gas plant is on fire.

0:17:02.220,0:17:07.709
So we didn't know... It was very very bad news.

0:17:07.709,0:17:10.560
So we ran out, drove down there.

0:17:10.560,0:17:15.500
God is so good. Almost getting there, the road was already blocked

0:17:15.500,0:17:19.900
because we live little bit far from the gas plant.

0:17:19.900,0:17:23.000
We now walked down there.

0:17:23.000,0:17:29.800
Only to get there to discover that the place was in a very messy situation.

0:17:29.850,0:17:37.500
God is so good. There was no fire. It would have been a different ball game entirely.

0:17:37.530,0:17:39.900
Lives!

0:17:39.900,0:17:49.200
It wasn't the property, the company - it was o'k.

0:17:49.230,0:17:54.000
But the community would have been raised down, it would be totally raised down.

0:17:54.000,0:17:57.300
I've never seen miracle like that. Actually I've never seen the miracle like that.

0:17:57.360,0:18:01.100
Sometimes, when I hear about miracle I just say: "It's a normal thing.

0:18:01.100,0:18:03.360
God has created us, He will do this thing for us."

0:18:03.360,0:18:09.300
But when I saw this thing, when I saw the gas -

0:18:09.300,0:18:13.480
my God, you need to see it and you need to see the real work of God -

0:18:13.480,0:18:16.900
not the one we talk about. Because you need to experience the work of God

0:18:16.950,0:18:19.260
before you know that God exists.

0:18:19.260,0:18:21.720
And your brother was saying that the slightest thing

0:18:21.720,0:18:24.510
could have caused the fire to spark.

0:18:24.510,0:18:30.400
A shoe sole... Some people work and they drag their legs.

0:18:30.400,0:18:34.600
It could spark off and the place would have been raised down.

0:18:34.600,0:18:39.000
Or even somebody that was a smoker in the enviroment.

0:18:39.030,0:18:42.090
There was a smoker. If he was a lunatic, I don't know.

0:18:42.090,0:18:45.900
He saw people running helter scelter but he was still smoking.

0:18:45.990,0:18:48.900
And with  my immediate senior brother - he is not here today -

0:18:48.900,0:18:57.300
we ran to the neighboring houses to beg them not to use their stoves, to stop their cooking.

0:18:57.330,0:19:02.800
And there was a woman who was already cooking outside with the kids around.

0:19:02.800,0:19:06.600
We begged her, we even used water to quench the fire and the pot of soup.

0:19:06.690,0:19:11.320
So it was very miraculous. God is good, God is too good.

0:19:11.320,0:19:15.900
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:19:15.990,0:19:17.730
So we can understand what our brother is saying -

0:19:17.730,0:19:22.000
even at that scene, someone was smoking outside, a woman was cooking -

0:19:22.000,0:19:25.900
and ordinarily that alone would have sparked the flammable gas

0:19:25.920,0:19:30.400
to have an explosion of fire that would have consumed the entire community.

0:19:30.480,0:19:33.900
But because of the Morning Water that had been ministered

0:19:33.900,0:19:36.300
and also the Morning Stickers that were in the entire environment -

0:19:36.360,0:19:39.330
that's how God secured that environment.

0:19:39.330,0:19:44.800
That even the person smoked and the person was cooking -  it did not spark the fire.

0:19:44.800,0:19:48.100
One more time let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:19:48.180,0:19:52.700
So as a witness to this miracle what is also your advise, your encouragement

0:19:52.790,0:19:54.890
to viewers all over the world?

0:19:54.890,0:19:58.310
Just to hang on God, just to keep very very close to God.

0:19:58.310,0:20:03.000
My advice is: keep your Morning Water very close to you.

0:20:03.020,0:20:05.900
Have it in your pocket, have you Sticker around you

0:20:05.900,0:20:11.700
because in the company, like my daddy said earlier, we have the stickers all around  -

0:20:11.700,0:20:14.600
in the trucks, the private, everywhere.

0:20:14.600,0:20:20.700
God is really good and my advice is: get closer to God.

0:20:20.750,0:20:26.000
If you have not - get closer. The prophet is just too big. Thank you.

0:20:26.000,0:20:26.810
Thank you, Jesus Christ.

0:20:26.810,0:20:30.400
Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
