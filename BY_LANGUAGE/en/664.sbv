STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:00:06.420,0:00:14.600
I'll just say yes You lead the way

0:00:14.600,0:00:22.760
I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say

0:00:22.760,0:00:30.820
This life You gave is not my own

0:00:30.820,0:00:39.480
I'm trusting You to hear my yes to lead me on

0:00:39.480,0:01:10.720
Yes Lord yes Lord my life is Yours

0:01:10.720,0:01:19.740
I'll just say yes You lead the way

0:01:19.740,0:01:27.640
I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say

0:01:27.640,0:01:36.200
This life You gave is not my own

0:01:36.200,0:01:46.520
I'm trusting You to hear my yes to lead me on

0:01:46.520,0:02:24.120
Yes Lord yes Lord my life is Yours

0:02:24.120,0:02:26.760
Hallelujah.

0:02:26.760,0:02:35.180
You have decreed the answer to yourself; give thanks to God for your confession.

0:02:35.180,0:02:37.600
That is strong confession.

0:02:37.600,0:02:44.780
Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised to do – that is favour.

0:02:44.780,0:02:50.240
He promised to favour you and you have decreed it already.

0:02:50.240,0:02:56.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:02:56.220,0:03:09.300
We want to fight – wage war aggressively against those things you want to do and you do not do.

0:03:09.300,0:03:14.960
You want to be faithful but you find yourself unfaithful.

0:03:14.960,0:03:17.960
Demons are the cause.

0:03:17.960,0:03:22.840
Many things you want to do but you do not do.

0:03:22.840,0:03:32.600
For you, you want to be faithful, kind, obedient but you find yourself otherwise – losing control.

0:03:32.600,0:03:38.500
Demons are the cause; demons are behind it.

0:03:38.500,0:03:39.940
Are you with me?

0:03:39.940,0:03:46.320
This is why we are here, to fight those demons aggressively, in the name of Jesus

0:03:46.320,0:03:53.200
and to restore you back because it takes control of your emotions.

0:03:53.200,0:03:57.180
You react emotionally.

0:03:57.180,0:04:00.560
Ordinarily, as a Christian, you would not react like that.

0:04:00.560,0:04:03.040
If I'm right...

0:04:03.040,0:04:06.060
It seems to take control of your emotions.

0:04:06.060,0:04:14.780
It has to lose that grip, in the name of Jesus; and leave you alone, because you are a child of God.

0:04:14.780,0:04:17.340
You are a child of God; that is why you are here today.

0:04:17.340,0:04:20.320
You know, ordinarily you can't come here.

0:04:20.320,0:04:21.980
Are you with me?

0:04:21.980,0:04:29.560
Ordinarily, you can't come here, going by what you have gone through before coming here.

0:04:29.560,0:04:33.840
What you have seen before coming here, what you have heard before coming here,

0:04:33.840,0:04:41.220
the pain and all you have gone through – ordinarily, you cannot come here.

0:04:41.220,0:04:46.040
This is to prove that you are a child of God.

0:04:46.040,0:04:52.560
Ordinarily, you would have been here a long time ago.

0:04:52.560,0:04:55.840
There are many people here today who were supposed to be here ten years ago;

0:04:55.840,0:04:59.340
ordinarily, they would have been here ten years ago.

0:04:59.340,0:05:03.260
But you can't come here ordinarily.

0:05:03.260,0:05:09.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:09.960,0:05:12.180
Tell your neighbour, "Ordinarily, you cannot come here".

0:05:12.180,0:05:14.840
[Ordinarily, you cannot come here.]

0:05:14.840,0:05:19.620
And ordinarily, you would not be able to obey what you hear today or what you are seeing;

0:05:19.620,0:05:24.500
ordinarily, you cannot obey them.

0:05:24.500,0:05:29.620
You can say you are not ordinary.

0:05:29.620,0:05:35.000
You are not ordinary; so, why do you compare yourself to others?

0:05:35.000,0:05:37.220
When others go this way, you want to go that way.

0:05:37.220,0:05:40.660
YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHERS

0:05:40.660,0:05:43.000
When you are sick...

0:05:43.000,0:05:45.720
You always compare your sickness to others.

0:05:45.720,0:05:47.780
Your sickness is not like others.

0:05:47.780,0:05:54.000
Your sickness is not to kill you or destroy you but to strengthen your desire for God.

0:05:54.000,0:05:58.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:58.280,0:06:00.160
Tell your neighbour, "I am not ordinary".

0:06:00.160,0:06:01.700
[I am not ordinary.]

0:06:01.700,0:06:06.300
If you know that your disappointment is not like others -

0:06:06.300,0:06:09.880
others, their disappointment is to destroy them, to ruin them.

0:06:09.880,0:06:17.280
But your disappointment is to strengthen your desire, to prepare you for a new life coming.

0:06:17.280,0:06:19.340
You need some...

0:06:19.340,0:06:22.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:22.460,0:06:24.220
Tell your neighbour, "I am not ordinary".

0:06:24.220,0:06:25.640
[I am not ordinary.]

0:06:25.640,0:06:29.660
If you know you are not ordinary, why do you compare yourself to others?

0:06:29.660,0:06:36.880
When others have headache, their headache can kill them – your headache cannot kill you.

0:06:36.880,0:06:46.500
It is the same name; headache, cancer, liver problem - but yours are not like others.

0:06:46.500,0:06:49.700
Your pain is not like others.

0:06:49.700,0:06:51.880
Are you with me?

0:06:51.880,0:06:55.620
Stop comparing yourself to others.

0:06:55.620,0:06:59.360
When others laugh you laugh - no.

0:06:59.360,0:07:04.460
You are under His eyes; you must hear from above.

0:07:04.460,0:07:08.900
You need corresponding power to do whatever you want to do.

0:07:08.900,0:07:12.020
They don't need any to do whatever they want to do.

0:07:12.020,0:07:13.980
You are not ordinary - tell you neighbour.

0:07:13.980,0:07:16.480
[You are not ordinary.]

0:07:16.480,0:07:20.140
Stop comparing yourself to others.

0:07:20.140,0:07:22.900
When others want to go this way you want to go that way.

0:07:22.900,0:07:26.840
This is why you are facing difficulties.

0:07:26.840,0:07:29.540
Your pain, from today, is not like others.

0:07:29.540,0:07:36.880
The Bible says that you will have pain, but that pain is not like the pain of others.

0:07:36.880,0:07:44.840
Your pain could be headache, setback, disappointment, even your pain could be divorce.

0:07:44.840,0:07:54.680
That divorce is not like others – it is to preserve you from something bad that is coming.

0:07:54.680,0:08:03.100
When you have some little problem you will look at others that had such a problem in the past.

0:08:03.100,0:08:09.880
You will see what happened to them; they die, they cripple;

0:08:09.880,0:08:11.700
you would think the same thing would happen to you - no.

0:08:11.700,0:08:13.580
Your problem is no like others.

0:08:13.580,0:08:25.560
God is aware of your pain.

0:08:25.560,0:08:37.880
He said, 'In this world, there will be trouble, tribulation; cheer up, I'm aware'.

0:08:37.880,0:08:42.320
Whatever you are going through now is for a purpose.

0:08:42.320,0:08:43.480
What are you going through?

0:08:43.480,0:08:44.540
Ask your neighbour.

0:08:44.540,0:08:45.660
[What are you going through?]

0:08:45.660,0:08:49.800
It is not possible for anyone to say, "I am not going through anything".

0:08:49.800,0:08:53.600
You must be going through something because you are a stranger in here.

0:08:53.600,0:08:54.760
You are a stranger.

0:08:54.760,0:09:00.800
If you are in a place where you are a stranger you cannot avoid being punched.

0:09:00.800,0:09:11.180
It is not possible when you find yourself as a stranger in a new city, new place...

0:09:11.180,0:09:17.500
You are a stranger, no matter how many years you spend on this earth.

0:09:17.500,0:09:21.360
You are a stranger and you are in the market.

0:09:21.360,0:09:25.600
No matter how many years you spend in the market, you will still return home.

0:09:25.600,0:09:37.000
Tell your neighbour, "No matter how many years you spend in the market, you will return home".

0:09:37.000,0:09:42.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:42.340,0:09:46.120
You will definitely return home.

0:09:46.120,0:09:48.900
What we are going through is not like others.

0:09:48.900,0:10:00.080
You must be going through something because there is no 'free zone'.

0:10:00.080,0:10:01.740
You must be going through something.

0:10:01.740,0:10:07.900
That does not mean you are not a Christian or a friend of Jesus.

0:10:07.900,0:10:12.120
That does not mean you are not a candidate of Heaven – you are a candidate.

0:10:12.120,0:10:20.700
You must be going through something.

0:10:20.700,0:10:32.020
That something is the purpose of your praying the more, fasting the more.

0:10:32.020,0:10:38.060
Ask your neighbour, "What are you going through?"

0:10:38.060,0:10:39.120
I cannot hear you.

0:10:39.120,0:10:40.680
[What are you going through?]

0:10:40.680,0:10:41.800
I cannot hear you

0:10:41.800,0:10:43.060
[What are you going through?]

0:10:43.060,0:10:45.480
It is meant to strengthen you; tell you neighbour.

0:10:45.480,0:10:46.660
[It is meant to strengthen you]

0:10:46.660,0:10:53.140
It is meant to prepare you for eternal life.

0:10:53.140,0:10:58.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:58.820,0:11:02.040
It is meant to prepare you for eternal life.

0:11:02.040,0:11:07.860
That does not mean because you are going through something you will not say, "Thank You, Jesus".

0:11:07.860,0:11:09.500
You refuse to say "Thank You, Jesus".

0:11:09.500,0:11:14.540
You always ask for healing, deliverance... No.

0:11:14.540,0:11:19.500
If you are waiting for when you will be one hundred percent free,

0:11:19.500,0:11:23.400
you will not say, "Thank You, Jesus" one day.

0:11:23.400,0:11:25.200
That time will never come.

0:11:25.200,0:11:26.040
Tell your neighbour.

0:11:26.040,0:11:27.620
[That time will never come.]

0:11:27.620,0:11:33.840
Waiting for a hundred percent free – that time will never come.

0:11:33.840,0:11:41.160
Waiting for a hundred percent free – that time may never come.

0:11:41.160,0:11:42.440
I cannot hear you.

0:11:42.440,0:11:46.020
[Waiting for a hundred percent free – that time may never come.]

0:11:46.020,0:11:49.120
That is what you are waiting for.

0:11:49.120,0:11:51.360
Yesterday you had a headache.

0:11:51.360,0:11:53.660
Now the headache is gone.

0:11:53.660,0:11:55.220
Now stomachache.

0:11:55.220,0:12:00.800
Because of stomachache you will not give thanks to God for taking away the headache.

0:12:00.800,0:12:08.320
What you are waiting for is to be one hundred percent pain free and success in business.

0:12:08.320,0:12:11.880
Oh my God.

0:12:11.880,0:12:14.640
You can move freely.

0:12:14.640,0:12:18.760
You receive a phone call, "Hello, the business is fine".

0:12:18.760,0:12:21.700
You sleep well - no nightmares.

0:12:21.700,0:12:23.220
You open the doors - no problem.

0:12:23.220,0:12:27.940
Everybody praises you.

0:12:27.940,0:12:31.800
No one talks bad about you.

0:12:31.800,0:12:36.420
No one persecutes or intimidates you.

0:12:36.420,0:12:37.740
This is what you are waiting for.

0:12:37.740,0:12:42.540
That time may never come.

0:12:42.540,0:12:55.180
If the money in business comes, there will come a problem to consume this money.

0:12:55.180,0:12:56.280
Can you see?

0:12:56.280,0:12:59.580
When there is no money, your child has no sickness.

0:12:59.580,0:13:05.940
When there is money your child has a sickness.

0:13:05.940,0:13:10.320
When you do not have money nobody would call you a bad name.

0:13:10.320,0:13:13.740
When you have money they would say you did a ritual.

0:13:13.740,0:13:17.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:17.040,0:13:26.880
That time may never come because you are a stranger in the market.

0:13:26.880,0:13:33.900
A man may be sick in body and yet, a friend of God.

0:13:33.900,0:13:38.080
If you see somebody sick you say this is a result of a sin.

0:13:38.080,0:13:39.680
It is an enemy.

0:13:39.680,0:13:46.780
When you see somebody sick you say it is a result of a sin... No.

0:13:46.780,0:13:53.720
A man may be sick and yet, a favourite of Jesus.

0:13:53.720,0:14:00.740
Don’t let your situation rule you.

0:14:00.740,0:14:04.780
The situation used to talk, it has a voice.

0:14:04.780,0:14:10.760
You will hear; "Why this problem? Because you are not faithful. Because Jesus doesn't love you.

0:14:10.760,0:14:18.740
That is why you have this problem. Look at your colleague who is a smoker - a "club-goer;

0:14:18.740,0:14:24.120
his life is fine. You don't have money. He is the one giving you money."

0:14:24.120,0:14:31.560
This kind of voice is to overthrow your position.

0:14:31.560,0:14:35.620
Ordinarily, you cannot come here.

0:14:35.620,0:14:47.340
You wake up in the morning, you dress up; something would talk to you, "Don't go" - it is a battle.

0:14:47.340,0:14:56.740
"Don't go. What are you going to do there? The man will not come out. He will not see you."

0:14:56.740,0:15:05.600
You will receive a phone call, saying that million dollars has been reserved for you, you just have to come.

0:15:05.600,0:15:09.420
Oh, I will not go to the church...

0:15:09.420,0:15:13.620
But at the end - you are here.

0:15:13.620,0:15:19.640
YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHERS

0:15:19.640,0:15:24.920
That is what I mean by "ordinarily, you cannot come here."

0:15:24.920,0:15:29.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:29.160,0:15:37.920
If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth – ordinarily, you cannot come here.

0:15:37.920,0:15:49.760
Tell your neighbour, "If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth – ordinarily, you cannot come here. "

0:15:49.760,0:15:55.660
How do you know where you are going is a place where God wants you to be?

0:15:55.660,0:16:02.260
The moment you have the thought of going there, battle starts.

0:16:02.260,0:16:03.540
Trouble.

0:16:03.540,0:16:10.580
Maybe it is a place, where God wants you to be - and you receive a news that you must go there.

0:16:10.580,0:16:13.040
It may take two weeks to go.

0:16:13.040,0:16:18.120
The trouble will come.

0:16:18.120,0:16:22.720
Thoughts of not going there will come.

0:16:22.720,0:16:27.740
You may even be arrested in order to stop you from going there.

0:16:27.740,0:16:32.000
A lot of news, phone calls, troubles...

0:16:32.000,0:16:33.320
You may not even have money to come.

0:16:33.320,0:16:41.740
You may have an accident on the day of coming; nothing would happen to you, but the vehicle will be damaged.

0:16:41.740,0:16:44.780
Just to stop you from going there.

0:16:44.780,0:16:54.820
There are many businesses you have lost to prevent you from coming here.

0:16:54.820,0:17:01.180
Whatever you want to do and it’s smooth at the beginning, know the end is not good.

0:17:01.180,0:17:13.100
When you start something and the beginning is smooth, profitable; know that the end is to cry about.

0:17:13.100,0:17:18.020
Anything close to Jesus receives an attack.

0:17:18.020,0:17:24.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:24.720,0:17:34.260
You have lost many relationships because hearing that this man is a criminal; whereas satan doesn't want you

0:17:34.260,0:17:36.260
to continue this relationship.

0:17:36.260,0:17:45.540
It is a relationship that would be profitable and would change and transform your life.

0:17:45.540,0:17:47.840
But someone says that this man is a criminal.

0:17:47.840,0:17:51.360
They will even send a letter, a text message...

0:17:51.360,0:17:55.840
They will do a lot to stop you.

0:17:55.840,0:18:03.960
Many of you stopped a lot of relationships just because of what you had heard.

0:18:03.960,0:18:10.220
And that is the relationship that could have changed your life and career.

0:18:10.220,0:18:12.360
Are you talking of business?

When you start a business that would transform your life, take you to "high places", it would look like a trouble.

0:18:23.900,0:18:28.360
You will see lost in whatever you invest in.

0:18:28.360,0:18:31.420
As you move the troubles continue.

0:18:31.420,0:18:36.060
As you move the troubles continue to the extent you find yourself in debts.

0:18:36.060,0:18:43.280
Please continue; these troubles will stop somewhere.

Many of you has today many business cards.

0:19:03.480,0:19:06.140
You don' know which one to use.

0:19:06.140,0:19:12.060
You were once a lawyer, now you are a contractor of any kind.

0:19:12.060,0:19:17.460
It is because of failures, debts you keep running from one business to another.

0:19:17.460,0:19:25.380
And you don't know that those things are a proof of genuineness of what you are doing.

0:19:25.380,0:19:26.740
Are you talking of marriage?

0:19:26.740,0:19:28.820
There are many marriages today...

0:19:28.820,0:19:29.960
My God.

0:19:29.960,0:19:35.940
People move from one man to another, one woman to another; just because of crisis -

0:19:35.940,0:19:45.020
and that crisis is a test to proof that this is a marriage from God.

0:19:45.020,0:19:50.400
There can be no genuine without first, fake.

0:19:50.400,0:19:56.380
When you meet a good family today; they will tell you what they have gone through,

0:19:56.380,0:20:02.120
before becoming a "role model".

0:20:02.120,0:20:09.400
A good marriage; when you meet them they will tell you what they have gone through.

In the same business...

0:20:17.000,0:20:27.720
Many businessman today that are at the centre of their own world - it was a sack letter that put them there.

0:20:27.720,0:20:34.920
The sack letter they received initially gave them that idea to start their own business.

0:20:34.920,0:20:37.920
Today, they are world generals.

0:20:37.920,0:20:46.820
But many of us, while receiving a sack letter, think of committing suicide, or joining a criminal gang.

0:20:46.820,0:20:50.940
Many are arm-robbers, murderers today.

0:20:50.940,0:20:57.860
When you catch them they will tell you, "I was once a manager of a company. I was sucked.

0:20:57.860,0:21:03.440
I had nothing to do. I joined the arm-robbers".

0:21:03.440,0:21:14.340
Whereas many successful businessmen started their own business when the sack letter was given them.

0:21:14.340,0:21:17.620
Life is just like that.

0:21:17.620,0:21:25.160
You need to sit down and ask yourself, "Am I right?"

0:21:25.160,0:21:28.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:28.980,0:21:34.080
In our walking with the Lord, there are good and hard times.

0:21:34.080,0:21:44.880
In our walking with the Lord; time to laugh and time to cry.

0:21:44.880,0:21:51.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:51.320,0:21:55.720
You know those things that can cause crying.

0:21:55.720,0:22:06.680
It could be persecution, sickness, pains of all kinds.

0:22:06.680,0:22:16.180
Failure, hatred, temptation.

0:22:16.180,0:22:23.200
In our walking with the Lord, there are good and hard times alike.

0:22:23.200,0:22:24.740
Write it down.

0:22:24.740,0:22:30.140
This is to walk together with Jesus.

0:22:30.140,0:22:38.540
There are good times and there are hard times, when we are walking.

0:22:38.540,0:22:43.160
You know good times, but hard times you may not know.

0:22:43.160,0:22:50.640
Good time is a time to laugh, "I am happy, everything is OK".

0:22:50.640,0:22:58.180
And there is a hard time, and you know those things that can cause crying.

0:22:58.180,0:22:59.820
You know those things.

0:22:59.820,0:23:03.220
What you are going through.

0:23:03.220,0:23:05.980
These are the things that can cause crying;

0:23:05.980,0:23:09.740
pain,

0:23:09.740,0:23:18.080
sickness - you may receive a medical report saying that, "this is death".

0:23:18.080,0:23:19.480
You would cry.

0:23:19.480,0:23:24.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:24.000,0:23:29.860
But you never consider the other side

0:23:29.860,0:23:32.100
in your walking with Him.

0:23:32.100,0:23:40.020
This is why Himself said, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:23:40.020,0:23:46.440
Because He knew that there would be hard times, time to cry.

0:23:46.440,0:23:51.660
You would rather seek a witch doctor than Jesus.

0:23:51.660,0:24:01.340
He said, "I pray your faith will not fail", when the hard time comes, while walking with me.

0:24:01.340,0:24:08.260
Tell your neighbour, "I pray your faith will not fail".

0:24:08.260,0:24:20.820
It means that something will challenge you, tempt you, hit you, bite you, curse you, something will... Oh my God.

0:24:30.440,0:24:36.320
In a hard time, when you are overwhelmed, you lose relationship with Jesus.

0:24:36.320,0:24:38.120
At the same time you cannot...

0:24:38.120,0:24:42.880
The joyful heart is where Jesus...

0:24:42.880,0:24:46.160
When you are overwhelmed...

0:24:46.160,0:24:54.640
The thing that can make you cry, and overwhelms you - you cannot serve God.

0:24:54.640,0:24:58.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:58.300,0:25:01.800
This is what happens to you people today.

0:25:01.800,0:25:03.800
You seem to be overwhelmed.

0:25:03.800,0:25:10.580
Things that can make you cry; not only you cry but you are overwhelmed by the thing.

0:25:10.580,0:25:18.640
Not only you cry, complain, murmur, you are despaired but you are overwhelmed.

0:25:18.640,0:25:21.100
When you are overwhelmed by the situation you cannot pray.

0:25:21.100,0:25:22.160
You will lose the relationship.

0:25:22.160,0:25:24.860
The relationship is gone.

0:25:24.860,0:25:31.380
Then you ask, "Why me of this?"

0:25:31.380,0:25:36.700
You begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.

0:25:36.700,0:25:41.440
Ordinarily, you cannot be here.

0:25:41.440,0:25:46.040
If you are overwhelmed by your situation you cannot come here.

0:25:46.040,0:25:48.620
You are here because your are not overwhelmed yet.

0:25:48.620,0:25:52.100
You have a situation but you are not overwhelmed yet.

0:25:52.100,0:25:58.780
You cannot come here ordinarily -

0:25:58.780,0:26:02.000
as it should be by divine will.

0:26:02.000,0:26:04.020
God is aware of your coming here.

0:26:04.020,0:26:06.640
[Amen.]
