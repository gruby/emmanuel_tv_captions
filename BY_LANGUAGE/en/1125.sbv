The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:02.380,0:00:07.340
Good Morning!

0:00:07.340,0:00:11.660
I say, "Good Morning".

0:00:11.660,0:00:18.420
Viewers all over the world, I salute your faith.

0:00:18.420,0:00:21.580
Good Morning to you!

0:00:21.580,0:00:26.220
You may be seated.

0:00:26.220,0:00:30.640
Hallelujah!

0:00:30.640,0:00:36.800
Let me quickly take you up on a message titled

0:00:36.800,0:00:39.820
GOD’S LOVE NEVER FAILS

0:00:39.820,0:00:42.300
Let's take our reading.

0:00:42.300,0:00:48.920
I will take you to different Books in the New Testament.

0:00:48.920,0:01:01.580
We will take the first reading from the Book of Romans 8 and we start our reading from verse 35 to the end.

0:01:01.580,0:01:03.480
That will be our first reading.

0:01:03.480,0:01:16.620
After that, we will go to the Book of Joshua 1:9 - it is also very key for this message.

0:01:16.620,0:01:26.580
After leaving that Book, we will also find our root in the Book of Matthew 6 from verse 25.

0:01:26.580,0:01:31.080
Our root concerning the message, "GOD'S LOVE NEVER FAILS".

0:01:31.080,0:01:35.620
That is Matthew 6:25.

0:01:35.620,0:01:54.740
When we leave there, we have other Books too that will help us - the Book of Numbers 20:8.

0:01:54.740,0:02:05.300
Let's now go to the Book of 1 Corinthians 1:8 - it will be a wonderful reading for us.

0:02:05.300,0:02:14.600
And 2 Corinthians too, chapter 12: 7-10 - it will be also very useful for us.

0:02:14.600,0:02:19.800
Take your Bible when you get home - you have enough time for this.

0:02:19.800,0:02:27.060
After listening to the message, you will be able to find more details about these Books given to you:

0:02:27.060,0:02:36.460
the Book of Joshua 1:9,

0:02:36.460,0:02:46.140
the Book of Romans 8:35 - 38 - it will be very useful showing that God's love never fails,

0:02:46.140,0:03:01.200
and the Book of Matthew - the issue of worry; it is detailed in the Book of Matthew 6:25 - very important.

0:03:01.200,0:03:08.620
And 1 Corinthians 1:18,

0:03:08.620,0:03:22.860
2 Corinthians 12:7 - 10 about Apostle Paul, the thorn; that will be very useful.

0:03:22.860,0:03:29.200
Let's go to the Book of Romans first.

0:03:29.200,0:03:35.460
Life through the Spirit - Romans 8.

0:03:35.460,0:03:56.020
“Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,

0:03:56.020,0:04:04.020
because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life

0:04:04.020,0:04:11.000
has set you free from the law of sin and death.”

0:04:11.000,0:04:17.380
Let's go to our proof reading - verse 35.

0:04:17.380,0:04:23.780
“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

0:04:23.780,0:04:37.440
Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?

0:04:37.440,0:04:44.540
As it is written: ‘For your sake we face death all day long;

0:04:44.540,0:04:48.160
we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.’"

0:04:48.160,0:04:49.900
Verse 37.

0:04:49.900,0:04:58.060
“No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."

0:04:58.060,0:04:59.580
38

0:04:59.580,0:05:09.820
“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,

0:05:09.820,0:05:18.560
neither the present nor the future, nor any powers…”

0:05:18.560,0:05:28.800
Take your time and read it from verse 35 to the end.

0:05:28.800,0:05:31.560
Yes.

0:05:31.560,0:05:33.860
God's love never fails.

0:05:33.860,0:05:42.240
That Book of Romans, chapter 8 verse 35 to the end.

0:05:42.240,0:05:47.060
What can separate us from the love of Christ?

0:05:47.060,0:05:48.460
Can worry?

0:05:48.460,0:05:51.100
Because this is the problem today.

0:05:51.100,0:05:59.640
When you ask your brother, he will tell you, "I'm worried. I will not be able to see T.B. Joshua before I leave today.

0:05:59.640,0:06:04.340
I'm worried; I will not be able to be prayed for.

0:06:04.340,0:06:13.520
I'm worried if I'm going to see this man one on one - I have problem" - worry.

0:06:13.520,0:06:17.400
Can worry ... - worry about what?

0:06:17.400,0:06:19.740
Families.

0:06:19.740,0:06:27.260
Can worry ... worry about present?

0:06:27.260,0:06:33.340
Can worry ... worry about the future?

0:06:33.340,0:06:37.200
What can separate you?

0:06:37.200,0:06:47.020
Can worry, worry about your work responsibilities... "How will I go about it?"

0:06:47.020,0:06:51.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:51.580,0:06:56.320
Can worry ... worry about your weight?

0:06:56.320,0:07:04.200
Many people complain about their weight, "I'm too fat..." - worry about weight.

0:07:04.200,0:07:06.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:06.920,0:07:10.120
Worry, worry, worry...

0:07:10.120,0:07:17.180
The list of worries is endless.

0:07:17.180,0:07:22.980
"I'm dark in complexion; I want to bleach my colour.

0:07:22.980,0:07:26.840
I have an oblong face; I need a round face.

0:07:26.840,0:07:32.020
My nose is too small; I want to operate it.

0:07:32.020,0:07:38.220
I want to add more to my 'bum bum'."

0:07:38.220,0:07:44.640
Worry, worry, worry...

0:07:44.640,0:07:51.740
"There are so many gaps in my teeth; I need to operate it.

0:07:51.740,0:07:57.360
Look at what the man of God wears today; I need this suit."

0:07:57.360,0:08:04.120
After the break you go to the car-park, you look around at different kinds of cars,

0:08:04.120,0:08:07.000
"My God, I need this jeep."

0:08:07.000,0:08:12.500
Worry, worry, worry...

0:08:12.500,0:08:22.920
Worry interferes with God’s Spirit in our life.

0:08:22.920,0:08:33.280
Worry interferes with God’s Spirit and you need God’s Spirit.

0:08:33.280,0:08:39.660
"I want to add to my hair, I need some wig."

0:08:39.660,0:08:43.520
Worry, worry, worry...

0:08:43.520,0:08:50.220
Each time you look in the mirror, you have something to worry about,

0:08:50.220,0:08:56.500
because of the way you look and the way others look.

0:08:56.500,0:08:58.740
Worry, worry...

0:08:58.740,0:09:05.700
The list of worries is endless.

0:09:05.700,0:09:28.660
Despite all these worries, God’s love for us remains unfailing.

0:09:28.660,0:09:37.920
The reality is this: We all experience worry, including me.

0:09:37.920,0:09:42.220
Ask me what is my worry.

0:09:42.220,0:10:02.020
You – how you will get Heaven because of inconsistency.

0:10:02.020,0:10:06.320
Because Jesus will come like a thief in the night.

0:10:06.320,0:10:10.040
No one knows when and how.

0:10:10.040,0:10:16.220
Where will you be?

0:10:16.220,0:10:19.720
If I know you today, I may not know you tomorrow.

0:10:19.720,0:10:23.820
If you are with me today, you may not be with me tomorrow.

0:10:23.820,0:10:28.720
Where will you be?

0:10:28.720,0:10:46.920
Will you be ready when the Lord shall come

0:10:46.920,0:11:34.360
I will be ready
When the Lord shall come

0:11:34.360,0:11:46.880
Worries interfere with God’s Spirit in our life.

0:11:46.880,0:11:52.720
Many are here, but they are not here because of worry.

0:11:52.720,0:11:56.740
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:56.740,0:11:59.460
We all experience worry.

0:11:59.460,0:12:09.280
Worry about present, worry about our future, worry about failure.

0:12:09.280,0:12:25.520
Even the great heroes of our faith experienced their own share of worry about failure.

0:12:25.520,0:12:29.020
That is why I give you those Books to read.

0:12:29.020,0:12:38.940
Don't forget to add Genesis 20:1-end to the Books I gave you to read.

0:12:38.940,0:12:43.460
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:43.460,0:12:53.300
Even the great heroes of our faith experienced their own share of failure.

0:12:53.300,0:13:09.860
Abraham, Moses, Elijah, John, Peter, Paul -

0:13:09.860,0:13:29.480
they all knew what it was like to make serious mistakes

0:13:29.480,0:13:42.400
but God used even their mistakes to bring them to the place where He wanted them to be.

0:13:42.400,0:13:46.540
Because God never created failure.

0:13:46.540,0:13:52.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:52.940,0:14:07.220
Tell your neighbour, “I want to be the person You created, oh Lord.”

0:14:07.220,0:14:12.960
He never created failure; there is no failure in Him.

0:14:12.960,0:14:21.160
Say, “I want to be the person You created”.

0:14:21.160,0:14:27.960
Today, everybody desires breakthrough.

0:14:27.960,0:14:34.380
Today, everybody desires success,

0:14:34.380,0:14:46.620
whereas disappointment sometimes serves to keep us for success.

0:14:46.620,0:14:53.680
Failure sometimes serves to keep us from breakthrough.

0:14:53.680,0:15:02.860
Setback sometimes serves to keep us for the future we desire.

0:15:02.860,0:15:17.140
God used their failure to bring them to the place where He wanted them to be, the place of honour.

0:15:17.140,0:15:25.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:25.320,0:15:29.860
In that reading given to you, you will find that

0:15:29.860,0:15:44.280
Abraham failed God when he fled to Egypt during the drought.

0:15:44.280,0:15:49.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:49.800,0:16:01.720
Moses lost his temper and turned to violence more than once.

0:16:01.720,0:16:08.000
He lost his temper.

0:16:08.000,0:16:10.240
Are you talking of David?

0:16:10.240,0:16:17.040
He committed murder and adultery.

0:16:17.040,0:16:21.440
Peter denied Jesus Christ

0:16:21.440,0:16:36.760
and yet the Lord used all the people who failed Him.

0:16:36.760,0:16:50.460
No matter how many times you fail, His love never does.

0:16:50.460,0:16:59.540
There are many successful people out there in our society all over the world

0:16:59.540,0:17:06.740
that have once had the same experience you are going through -

0:17:06.740,0:17:27.200
failure, setback, sickness, disease but today, God has changed their story.

0:17:27.200,0:17:37.040
Ask successful people out there; they will tell you how much disappointment they have endured,

0:17:37.040,0:17:42.560
how much sickness they have endured, how much failure they have endured,

0:17:42.560,0:17:46.660
how much stagnation they have endured

0:17:46.660,0:17:55.440
to come to their breakthrough, to the place of honour, the future they deserve.

0:17:55.440,0:18:00.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:00.360,0:18:11.040
Reason well as a Christian – you will see why you are going through the challenges you have.

0:18:11.040,0:18:13.420
Do what?

0:18:13.420,0:18:28.080
With deep reflection, you will see why you are going through the challenges.

0:18:28.080,0:18:40.440
With deep reflection, you will see why you are going through the situation.

0:18:40.620,0:18:46.040
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:46.040,0:18:55.680
It takes faith to realise that our situation is a mere stopping interval,

0:18:55.680,0:19:02.720
a short break between two events.

0:19:02.720,0:19:09.940
It takes faith, not experience we use today -

0:19:09.940,0:19:15.620
because you have gone all over the world, you are well educated.

0:19:15.620,0:19:18.920
No, not experience – faith.

0:19:18.920,0:19:38.920
It takes faith to realise that our situation is a mere stopping interval – a transit point to connect.

0:19:38.920,0:19:43.240
Not your destination – it is a preparation to success.

0:19:43.240,0:19:47.260
Not your destination – it is a bridge to success.

0:19:47.260,0:19:49.100
What is your situation?

0:19:49.100,0:19:50.540
Ask your neighbour.

0:19:50.540,0:19:52.020
[What is your situation?]

0:19:52.020,0:19:53.220
I cannot heart you.

0:19:53.220,0:19:54.540
[What is your situation?]

0:19:54.540,0:19:55.920
I cannot hear you.

0:19:55.920,0:19:57.060
[What is your situation?]

0:19:57.060,0:19:58.240
I cannot heart you.

0:19:58.240,0:19:59.700
[What is your situation?]

0:19:59.700,0:20:06.620
What are you going through?

0:20:06.620,0:20:16.440
Is it inability to get a job in spite of your qualifications?

0:20:16.440,0:20:20.980
Is it inability to get a job?

0:20:20.980,0:20:29.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:29.000,0:20:36.260
What are you going through, what are the challenges?

0:20:36.260,0:20:51.800
The great heroes of our faith had their own share of challenges

0:20:51.800,0:21:03.700
and God used their challenges to bring them to the place where He wanted them to be.

0:21:03.700,0:21:15.660
With deep reflection, you will see reason why you are going through your challenges.

0:21:15.660,0:21:19.800
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:19.800,0:21:27.360
Challenge is not a crisis; it’s a friend.

0:21:27.360,0:21:31.420
It’s a bridge; it’s a preparation.

0:21:31.420,0:21:42.980
It’s a stopping interval; it’s not a crisis.

0:21:42.980,0:22:06.140
Lord, in spite of our weaknesses, in spite of our failure, help us to learn from them.

0:22:06.140,0:22:07.640
It is a school of lessons.

0:22:07.640,0:22:15.380
Your challenge is a school of lessons but you don’t look at it that way.

0:22:15.380,0:22:18.320
You look at it as a crisis.

0:22:18.320,0:22:19.340
Where will you learn?

0:22:19.340,0:22:24.680
That is the best college, which is better than the one you go to out there.

0:22:24.680,0:22:30.880
Challenges are the best college to learn how to handle your future.

0:22:30.880,0:22:35.100
You have to learn once and for all from your challenges

0:22:35.100,0:22:40.080
and get connected to the future you deserve.

0:22:40.080,0:22:42.420
It’s a bridge; get connected.

0:22:42.420,0:22:46.000
Learn and get connected.

0:22:46.000,0:22:50.040
If not, it will be throwback.

0:22:50.040,0:22:56.860
Many challenges you are facing today, and you are not supposed to.

0:22:56.860,0:23:03.940
You have someone helping you to push your challenges somewhere,

0:23:03.940,0:23:12.660
not in a normal way, but it is there to push it somewhere.

0:23:12.660,0:23:14.980
You know this thing is not right for you.

0:23:14.980,0:23:22.200
You get it at all cost because you have somebody to help you - but it will be throwback.

0:23:22.200,0:23:26.400
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:26.400,0:23:32.060
It will become a carry-over to our life.

0:23:32.060,0:23:44.420
Finally, this is a word of exhortation:

0:23:44.420,0:23:57.940
What we see as a failure is not failure at all from eternity’s perspective – from God’s angle.

0:23:57.940,0:24:06.620
What we see as a failure is not failure at all.

0:24:06.620,0:24:18.180
What we see as a failure is not failure at all from eternity’s perspective.

0:24:18.180,0:24:31.260
Jesus’ death on the Cross – His disciples at first thought it was failure

0:24:31.260,0:24:41.180
but what looked like a failure brought new life to all mankind.

0:24:41.180,0:24:48.360
Look at the case of Peter at the seaside, "I will make you a fisher of men, if you follow Me".

0:24:48.360,0:24:54.400
From disappointment to what?

0:24:54.400,0:25:03.160
Don't forget about Hannah; at what age...?

0:25:03.160,0:25:11.180
Worry about money, worry about relationships, worry about work responsibilities,

0:25:11.180,0:25:14.220
worry about someone who disappointed you -

0:25:14.220,0:25:23.160
all those things are a trap of the enemy to interfere with God’s Spirit in your life.

0:25:23.160,0:25:26.840
Once you are worried, nothing can work here;

0:25:26.840,0:25:33.480
nothing, even the Spirit of God cannot - nothing, you are for satan when you are worried.

0:25:33.480,0:25:38.420
At the moment you start worrying, you are a servant of satan.

0:25:38.420,0:25:41.300
If I am worried, I will not come here.

0:25:41.300,0:25:43.260
I would not be able to come here

0:25:43.260,0:25:53.140
and if I force myself to come here, I would not be able to represent God here today.

0:25:53.140,0:26:00.740
Worry can cause hypertension, heart attack, blood pressure; just name those things worry can cause,

0:26:00.740,0:26:02.240
my dear brother.

0:26:02.240,0:26:05.720
It interferes with God's Spirit in our life.

0:26:05.720,0:26:13.660
Worry, worry, worry...

0:26:13.660,0:26:22.660
You don’t have to worry
And don’t you be afraid

0:26:22.660,0:26:31.580
Joy comes in the morning
Troubles they won’t last always

0:26:31.580,0:26:41.600
Remember there’s a Friend named Jesus
Who will wipe your tears away

0:26:41.600,0:26:51.700
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say

0:26:51.700,0:27:01.640
I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand

0:27:01.640,0:27:12.500
No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

0:27:12.500,0:27:22.380
With Jesus I can take it
With Him I know I can stand

0:27:22.380,0:27:33.500
No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

0:27:33.500,0:27:43.580
You don’t have to worry
And don’t you be afraid

0:27:43.580,0:27:53.460
Joy comes in the morning
Troubles they won’t last always

0:27:53.460,0:28:03.800
Remember there’s a Friend named Jesus
Who will wipe your tears away

0:28:03.800,0:28:14.100
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say

0:28:14.100,0:28:23.820
I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand

0:28:23.820,0:28:34.280
No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

0:28:34.280,0:28:44.040
With Jesus I can take it
With Him I know I can stand

0:28:44.040,0:29:01.300
No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

0:29:01.300,0:29:03.280
Tell your neighbour,

0:29:03.280,0:29:18.900
What you see as a failure may not be at all – stop worrying.

0:29:18.900,0:29:24.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:29:24.100,0:29:35.220
Something that stands as a preparation, a bridge – can we call it a crisis?

0:29:35.220,0:29:38.200
Can we call preparation a crisis?

0:29:38.200,0:29:41.200
Can we call a bridge a crisis?

0:29:41.200,0:29:44.760
Can we call a stopping interval a crisis?

0:29:44.760,0:29:48.340
Can we call a transit point a crisis?

0:29:48.340,0:29:51.620
Can we call getting connected a crisis?

0:29:51.620,0:29:53.840
That are the challenges.

0:29:53.840,0:30:00.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:00.540,0:30:04.280
Whatever challenges you are going through, whether sickness,

0:30:04.280,0:30:10.580
all you need – you need to be a Christian.

0:30:10.580,0:30:16.880
Once you are a Christian, your challenges are not like others.

0:30:16.880,0:30:21.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:21.660,0:30:24.540
Listen!

0:30:24.540,0:30:31.060
Once you are a Christian, your sickness is not like others.

0:30:31.060,0:30:37.620
Your sickness is to preserve you, to keep you for a new level.

0:30:37.620,0:30:42.580
It may be to stop you awhile.

0:30:42.580,0:30:48.840
When you are stopped awhile, it is time to prepare you for the challenges ahead.

0:30:48.840,0:30:55.880
That is it.

0:30:55.880,0:31:04.580
Once you have whatever sickness,

0:31:04.580,0:31:18.640
or challenge that could be stagnation, joblessness, barrenness, loneliness...

0:31:18.640,0:31:21.920
That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot get sick

0:31:21.920,0:31:26.020
but your sickness is not like others.

0:31:26.020,0:31:26.780
Tell your neighbour,

0:31:26.780,0:31:31.740
That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot get sick

0:31:31.740,0:31:37.480
but your sickness is not like others.

0:31:37.480,0:31:41.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:31:41.860,0:31:43.820
Can you face your neighbour and tell:

0:31:43.820,0:31:49.460
That I am a Christian does not mean I cannot face challenges,

0:31:49.460,0:32:01.960
does not mean I cannot face situations but my challenges, my situations are not like others.

0:32:01.960,0:32:06.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:32:06.520,0:32:18.800
Others, their situation is to destroy them, to kill them, to wreck them, to sink them

0:32:18.800,0:32:33.200
but your own situation – you just need to be one with Jesus.

0:32:33.200,0:32:38.320
If anyone tells you that as a Christian, you cannot get sick, that is a wrong doctrine.

0:32:38.320,0:32:48.940
Where do you put Apostle Paul?

0:32:48.940,0:32:52.340
“When I am weak, then I am strong.”

0:32:52.340,0:32:57.700
When you are sick, then you are in good health.

0:32:57.700,0:33:02.340
When you are sick, then you are healed.

0:33:02.340,0:33:04.700
When you are stuck, then you are moving.

0:33:04.700,0:33:07.600
When you have failed, then you have success.

0:33:07.600,0:33:10.280
That is it.

0:33:10.280,0:33:16.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:16.240,0:33:22.120
Lesson, lesson, lesson; you need to grow.

0:33:22.120,0:33:25.960
Everyone; as I am here now, I need to grow more.

0:33:25.960,0:33:27.880
And to grow...

0:33:27.880,0:33:33.960
The best lesson, the best examination for growing is challenges.

0:33:33.960,0:33:41.820
You learn better in challenges.

0:33:41.820,0:33:54.560
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:33:54.560,0:34:10.380
What we see as failure may not be from eternity’s perspective.

0:34:10.380,0:34:17.580
That your sickness, that your failure, that your setback, delayed pregnancy,

0:34:17.580,0:34:27.860
whatever you call it that you are facing does not mean you are not a Christian.

0:34:27.860,0:34:33.340
Don’t allow your situation to rule you, to dictate to you whether you are a Christian or not.

0:34:33.340,0:34:37.000
“Because I am poor, I am not a Christian.”

0:34:37.000,0:34:47.380
A man can be poor and yet be a friend of Jesus.

0:34:47.380,0:34:49.200
Are you with me?

0:34:49.200,0:34:59.860
A man can be sick in body and yet be a candidate of Heaven.

0:34:59.860,0:35:04.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:04.600,0:35:06.980
You may be seated.

0:35:06.980,0:35:14.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:35:14.940,0:35:21.020
God’s love never fails.

0:35:21.020,0:35:29.060
The trap satan sets out there now for Christians is worry.

0:35:29.060,0:35:38.660
When the people of the world realise that you are happy, they dial your number,

0:35:38.660,0:35:43.640
"What can I tell this person? He is too happy."

0:35:43.640,0:35:56.180
"Hello. I had a very bad dream about you. Once I dreamt about this person and it happened,

0:35:56.180,0:35:59.380
and I dreamt about this person and it happened..."

0:35:59.380,0:36:02.740
By the time he has given you 5 good examples,

0:36:02.740,0:36:08.300
you will start urinating.

0:36:08.300,0:36:16.620
- "I dreamt about this, that. Go and ask..."
- "How can I see you?"

0:36:16.620,0:36:19.280
- "See me? OK, come."

0:36:19.280,0:36:24.900
Because he knows you are happy, he wants to make you sad, worried.

0:36:24.900,0:36:30.760
By then, he might have gathered some information about you.

0:36:30.760,0:36:35.180
Just to make you worried.

0:36:35.180,0:36:42.180
Worry interferes with God’s Spirit in your life.

0:36:42.180,0:36:42.900
Tell your neighbour,

0:36:42.900,0:36:50.600
Worry interferes with God’s Spirit in our life.

0:36:50.600,0:36:51.740
Once you are worried...

0:36:51.740,0:36:59.700
If I'm worried now, and I stretch my hand to say, "Be healed!", I'm talking to myself.

0:36:59.700,0:37:01.780
No healing; nothing.

0:37:01.780,0:37:10.360
If I just go there and say, "Be healed!", I'm hearing myself and you are hearing me, but God...

0:37:10.360,0:37:16.560
I would be hearing myself and you around me would be hearing me, but God...

0:37:16.560,0:37:18.520
Because I'm what?

0:37:18.520,0:37:20.780
I'm worried.

0:37:20.780,0:37:27.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:37:27.200,0:37:32.360
Those of you that wake up in the morning; you want to make your husband worried, your wife worried,

0:37:32.360,0:37:39.700
somebody worried; on the phone, you are good in giving negative news.

0:37:39.700,0:37:44.720
Worry, worry, worry...

0:37:44.720,0:37:46.600
I want to leave you here.

0:37:46.600,0:37:50.400
I know you have a lot of lessons to learn today.

0:37:50.400,0:37:54.280
How will you deal with worry?

0:37:54.280,0:37:58.180
Ask your neighbour, "How will you deal with worry?"

0:37:58.180,0:38:04.700
Little, little...

0:38:04.700,0:38:06.580
Thank you.
