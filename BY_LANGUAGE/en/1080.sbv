This mother and child have come to the Synagogue Church Of All Nations with a strange predicament.

0:00:08.520,0:00:13.100
The medical report states that the young child had swallowed a foreign object,

0:00:13.100,0:00:16.000
that is now stuck in his small throat.

0:00:16.000,0:00:21.120
The question is: What object did he swallow?

0:00:21.120,0:00:28.760
Shockingly the x-ray of the one year old clearly shows a cross pendant securely lodged in his throat.

0:00:28.760,0:00:34.120
The presence of such a large foreign object in the throat of a one year old boy

0:00:34.120,0:00:36.920
must cause extreme discomfort and pain.

0:00:36.920,0:00:41.580
If the object is not removed, it could be fatal.

0:00:41.580,0:00:47.020
His mother has brought him to the SCOAN in desperate need of Divine intervention.

0:00:47.020,0:00:50.280
Let's hear what happened.

0:00:50.280,0:00:56.520
My name is Gift Stephen. I am coming from Ebonyi State.

0:00:56.520,0:01:03.180
The baby I am carrying is my baby, Meshak Stephen 1 year and five months.

0:01:03.180,0:01:06.980
Tell us the problem you have brought to the SCOAN today.

0:01:06.980,0:01:14.320
The problem that brought me here; is my baby swallowed a foreign object in the throat.

0:01:14.320,0:01:18.440
You mean your baby has a foreign object in his throat.

0:01:18.440,0:01:19.200
Yes.

0:01:19.200,0:01:27.460
He swallowed cross pendant. Since he swallowed the cross pendant, he doesn't sleep at night.

0:01:27.460,0:01:32.640
Even at night when we go to sleep, we sit till day break. He vomits.

0:01:32.640,0:01:37.640
The day when the cross enter his throat, he vomited blood.

0:01:37.640,0:01:43.380
When I carried him to the chemist, they told me that he swallowed a cross.

0:01:43.380,0:01:47.520
I then looked for my cross on my neck and I did not find the cross again

0:01:47.520,0:01:54.260
from the chain, but the chain was there but the cross - he swallowed the cross.

0:01:54.260,0:01:58.540
The cross is for me. The chain and pendant is my own.

0:01:58.540,0:02:01.640
Where have you taken him to for solution?

0:02:01.640,0:02:07.780
I took him to the chemist for the first one. I carried him to so many hospitals.

0:02:07.780,0:02:10.360
They told me that an operation will take it out.

0:02:10.360,0:02:15.160
And now that you are here in SCOAN today: What is your belief in Christ Jesus?

0:02:15.160,0:02:19.020
I believe Jesus will heal my son. In Jesus' name.

0:02:19.020,0:02:20.100
Amen

0:02:20.100,0:02:23.680
Healing Time

0:02:23.680,0:02:28.760
Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance to the people in Jesus' name.

0:02:28.760,0:02:33.920
Among them is young Meshek Stephen and his mother who cries to the man of God for help.

0:02:33.920,0:02:40.260
The lady is explaining that the baby she is holding swallowed a cross pendant  as you can see in the x-ray.

0:02:40.260,0:02:48.200
So the cross pendant  is now stuck to the throat of the baby.

0:02:48.200,0:02:54.320
There is never a problem Jesus Christ can not solve. And with a touch from Heaven, he is free.

Mrs Gift Stephen and Family. Prayer Line Testimony.

0:02:58.720,0:03:05.820
My name is Gift. The man that is behind me is my husband.

0:03:05.820,0:03:11.300
The problem that brought me to this place is this my boy.

0:03:11.300,0:03:13.400
He swallowed a cross pendant.

0:03:13.400,0:03:14.860
What is the name of your boy?

0:03:14.860,0:03:20.180
The name of my boy is Meshack Stephen.

0:03:20.180,0:03:30.480
He swallowed cross pendant when I was sleeping with him around five o'clock in the evening on Thursday.

0:03:30.480,0:03:36.540
The necklace hole was open. He now carried the thing and  swallowed.

0:03:36.540,0:03:40.920
As he swallowed the cross pendant, I brought him to the chemistry.

0:03:40.920,0:03:45.900
The chemist now said I must carry him to the hospital. They said the thing is serious.

0:03:45.900,0:03:50.260
I carried him to hospital and they did an x-ray. The thing is there.

0:03:50.260,0:03:58.860
I carried him to another hospital. When we reached the hospital, the doctors said we should go for another x-ray.

0:03:58.860,0:04:08.380
we did the x-ray and came back. The thing was there. The thing was not shifted at all, it was there.

0:04:08.380,0:04:12.760
So I carried him to the same particular hospital.

0:04:12.760,0:04:18.960
They now directed me to the place where they could operate him on the neck to bring out the  thing.

0:04:18.960,0:04:22.000
So we were confused, if it was ok to operate the boy.

0:04:22.000,0:04:33.120
Because it's my church well well. We didn't carry him to the hospital because we were confused.

0:04:33.120,0:04:39.160
We carried him to The SCOAN. As we reached The SCOAN, man of God now prayed for him.

0:04:39.160,0:04:41.040
He prayed for him and finished.

0:04:41.040,0:04:48.120
When I went to the house, the boy vomited.

0:04:48.120,0:04:58.160
The next day he started eating. But before the only thing he took was water.

0:04:58.160,0:05:02.680
Ok let us take it one by one so that people  will understand what we saying.

0:05:02.680,0:05:11.700
So what happened to your son when he swallowed the pendant. Tell us what happened to your son?

0:05:11.700,0:05:16.400
When he swallowed the cross pendant, I was asleep.

0:05:16.400,0:05:20.840
When the boy was coughing and vomiting that's when I woke up.

0:05:20.840,0:05:24.380
And the boy vomited blood from his throat.

0:05:24.380,0:05:27.000
What did the boy do then?

0:05:27.000,0:05:31.100
He could not sleep and he was always crying.

0:05:31.100,0:05:34.800
When he was crying, he pointed at the throat to show me.

0:05:34.800,0:05:40.440
He was restless, he could not get himself.

0:05:40.440,0:05:41.980
What was he able to eat that time?

0:05:41.980,0:05:50.380
He could eat only tea, porridge and water.

0:05:50.380,0:05:57.560
And the mother further explained that when the boy ingested this metallic cross object,

0:05:57.560,0:06:04.820
that the boy could not eat then, that the only thing the boy could take was liquid things.

0:06:04.820,0:06:10.280
The man of God prayed for him. After he prayed for him, we went back to the house.

0:06:10.280,0:06:18.640
That night he vomited. After he vomited, we woke up in the morning. I gave him that tea.

0:06:18.640,0:06:26.760
He couldn't take the tea. He pointed at the pot. I gave him food which I cooked. He did not vomit it.

0:06:26.760,0:06:32.680
As the thing happened he started eating anything that he saw.

0:06:32.680,0:06:41.680
As he was eating, I now carried him to the hospital, went to the x-ray, we couldn't find the thing again.

0:06:41.680,0:06:46.740
Mrs Gift Stephen and Family Prayer Line Testimony

0:06:46.740,0:06:53.480
The mother further explained to the glory of God that after the prayer of man of God, Prophet T.B.Joshua,

0:06:53.480,0:07:00.380
that when they got home, the boy started vomiting and stooling. And when the vomiting stopped,

0:07:00.380,0:07:08.360
they found out the boy can eat normally. They noticed that boy started eating he saw around.

0:07:08.360,0:07:14.720
He started eating the food they gave to him. Unlike before that he could only take tea or anything liquid

0:07:14.720,0:07:21.600
because of the metallic  cross that was blocking the esophagus. Even for him to swallow his own spit,

0:07:21.600,0:07:25.540
was a problem. But after the prayer, the boy was completely free.

0:07:25.540,0:07:30.240
And because the boy had started eating, they took the boy to the same hospital

0:07:30.240,0:07:37.240
that did the first x-ray and they conducted another x-ray and found out the object is no longer there.

0:07:37.240,0:07:39.120
That is what we are seeing on the screen right now.

0:07:39.120,0:07:44.060
Mrs Gift Stephen and Family Prayer Line Testimony

0:07:44.060,0:07:47.660
As you can see on the screen of your television set, that is the x-ray that was taken

0:07:47.660,0:07:54.600
after the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua that proved that indeed, the object

0:07:54.600,0:07:59.680
that was in the esophagus of the boy is no longer there.

0:07:59.680,0:08:08.760
My name is Stephen Ogazie and the woman beside me is my wife and my son, Mesheck.

0:08:08.760,0:08:14.820
We both came from Ebonyi State, Nigeria.

0:08:14.820,0:08:19.300
As a matter of fact, I thank God for what God has done.

0:08:19.300,0:08:24.760
I came back from work and I found out that the child was vomiting blood.

0:08:24.760,0:08:30.380
So, I asked my wife what was the matter. She told me that she was looking for her cross pendant.

0:08:30.380,0:08:37.140
When they did the first x-ray; the x-ray report was brought to the doctor. That was an object,

0:08:37.140,0:08:40.720
a cross pendant in the child's throat.

0:08:40.720,0:08:45.860
So, the surgeon doctor said that the only thing we should do - if we have such amount of money

0:08:45.860,0:08:48.600
like N300 000 to N400 000 before we can start any work.

0:08:48.600,0:08:54.760
So I then began to recall some certain things that the Lord is doing in this great commission.

0:08:54.760,0:08:58.700
So I knew fully well that the case of this child is just a cup case.

0:08:58.700,0:09:02.440
And I know fully well that if they had operated this child, they would not succeed

0:09:02.440,0:09:07.240
because that place is a major part of the body, is a worst part of the body.

0:09:07.240,0:09:10.200
So I know that if this child undergo operation he won't succeed.

0:09:10.200,0:09:15.500
So I began to give myself a second thought based on things that the Lord is doing on this great commission..

0:09:15.500,0:09:18.740
I said, if is it not better, if I run to God.

0:09:18.740,0:09:23.780
So we were opportuned, on the 9th of September, I came with my wife.

0:09:23.780,0:09:27.820
We were opportuned to meet the Man of God. The Man of God took the child,

0:09:27.820,0:09:32.940
and laid hand and prayed for the child. After that prayer he pronounced Liberty.

0:09:32.940,0:09:38.880
So I was surprised. As a matter of fact we went back home that day, the child vomited.

0:09:38.880,0:09:46.340
The vomiting increased. So I believed that the cross must have passed through this waste material.

0:09:46.340,0:09:48.660
Because he did not give us rest that night.

0:09:48.660,0:09:51.900
So after that night, the child began to eat every food.

0:09:51.900,0:09:56.780
Initially,  he was only taking only liquid food, but he began to eat any kind of food.

0:09:56.780,0:10:01.240
He began to point to a particular food that we should bring for him.

0:10:01.240,0:10:06.800
So, I said, if this was the case, I now went back to the same surgeon doctor.

0:10:06.800,0:10:10.800
I said, " Sir there is something I want to verify." He said, "What is that?"

0:10:10.800,0:10:14.300
I said: "I want to run another test for this child."

0:10:14.300,0:10:20.940
He now agreed. He told me the price and we put the child on this machine and they ran the x-ray..

0:10:20.940,0:10:23.780
They brought the x-ray back. The man shouted.

0:10:23.780,0:10:29.300
He said: "Oga, what did you use to remove it?" I said: "I did not use anything, only prayer."

0:10:29.300,0:10:35.060
Mrs Gift Stephen and Family Prayer Line Testimony

0:10:35.060,0:10:37.980
So, I said I did not use anything but prayer!

0:10:37.980,0:10:40.200
He said: "Which kind of prayer would remove this thing?

0:10:40.200,0:10:44.580
Even the operation which you wanted to conduct, was not even enough.

0:10:44.580,0:10:49.260
We know how it is, only a professional doctor can touch that joint of a child."

0:10:49.260,0:10:56.680
I said we went to SCOAN. The man shouted. I said I came to SCOAN for prayer.

0:10:56.680,0:11:02.700
And my child was privileged to receive prayer from Man Of God and from that day the child got free.

0:11:02.700,0:11:10.380
So he said: "No problem." He ran the test, everything from the neck down to the sole of the feet of the child -

0:11:10.380,0:11:14.420
he could not find anything again - body, abdomen.

0:11:14.420,0:11:22.420
He now said: "Is this magic?" I said there is no magic because if not Jesus...

0:11:22.420,0:11:29.600
So the man said: "Thank God because this thing God has done to you - no man will ever do it.

0:11:29.600,0:11:36.220
this thing God has done to you - no man..."

0:11:36.220,0:11:38.960
He said this is the only case where God will visit you.

0:11:38.960,0:11:45.500
The man never agreed with me, he asked wether I used something to bring out the cross.

0:11:45.500,0:11:50.860
He said he did not see any sore, any sign of pain, any sign of sore.

0:11:50.860,0:11:55.660
I said there is nothing like that, it's just prayer. The man of God laid hand and prayed - that's the end.

0:11:55.660,0:12:00.100
And advised us with all manner of confidence that the case is settled.

0:12:00.100,0:12:06.640
The doctor himself was surprised. - He was surprised. He asked where is that place. I said this is SCOAN .

0:12:06.640,0:12:13.260
Shall will put our hands together for the Lord Jesus.

0:12:13.260,0:12:18.420
What seemed impossible with men is absolutely possible with God Almighty.

0:12:18.420,0:12:21.740
And we have seen evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt.

0:12:21.740,0:12:26.400
If not God what do we think could have happened to this little boy?

0:12:26.400,0:12:31.140
But we give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful miracle that God has brought in the life of...

0:12:31.140,0:12:34.180
So tell us what has been the condition of your son ever since then?

0:12:34.180,0:12:39.520
The condition of the child right from the day the Man of God prayed for him, there was no atom

0:12:39.520,0:12:48.860
of vomition again. The child have been free from every stress. The child sleeps well, we hardly wake him.

0:12:48.860,0:12:53.540
He sleeps well, he feels free, he plays all around. He takes any food.

0:12:53.540,0:12:58.920
So because of this thing, of this freedom we determined to go again for second x-ray.

0:12:58.920,0:13:07.180
Which we did, and the child has plain abdomen - the cross is no longer there.

0:13:07.180,0:13:12.340
So I now met the doctor and said, I wanted to run another x-ray.

0:13:12.340,0:13:18.800
So for a practical evidence. The man said, he runs the same x-ray, and showed me on the screen.

0:13:18.800,0:13:26.080
He said there is no need of printing it out because the case is settled, I should just go and give glory to God.

0:13:26.080,0:13:31.460
Mr Stephen Ogazie and Family Prayer Line Testimony

0:13:31.460,0:13:36.540
I just appreciate God. The first place here; is the place we went to the hospital and we were refereed to

0:13:36.540,0:13:38.780
another hospital because the surgeon doctor...

0:13:38.780,0:13:40.780
Let's start from the top so that we can understand.

0:13:40.780,0:13:45.100
This is one is just a report, the first x-ray report.

0:13:45.100,0:13:51.340
The first x-ray report here shows the child has an object in the lungs.

0:13:51.340,0:13:56.500
Then the second x-ray report - the same thing happened, the same picture was there, the same cross was still there.

0:13:56.500,0:14:02.380
Then the third one, this very one you see here - was just a referred letter to different hospitals.

0:14:02.380,0:14:06.520
Then this one is the final x-ray report that we did, that we brought to the doctor.

0:14:06.520,0:14:11.220
And the doctor pronounced that he had not seen anything from the body of the child anymore.

0:14:11.220,0:14:19.460
From this area. So we had to run the test from the throat down to the abdomen and could not find the cross anymore.

0:14:19.460,0:14:23.320
So the man said we should give thanks to God that this matter is settled.

0:14:23.320,0:14:25.460
That no man can do this except God.

0:14:25.460,0:14:29.520
So what we are seeing on the board is the before and the after.

0:14:29.520,0:14:35.160
Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.

0:14:35.160,0:14:40.360
Just down there we can also see an x-ray; can you just tell us more about the x-ray we seeing there?

0:14:40.360,0:14:48.040
Yes. This first place here was the first x-ray, the diagnosis history. The first x-ray report here.

0:14:48.040,0:14:54.440
Then the second one here; is the second x-ray report the doctor said he want to compare the both,

0:14:54.440,0:14:59.280
to know whether the cross was still on the same position. We went to the lab test.

0:14:59.280,0:15:02.220
and we brought the second x-ray. Then the last one here...

0:15:02.220,0:15:07.200
Just take it one after the other so that people can understand. We have three x-rays there,

0:15:07.200,0:15:11.840
the first one we are seeing there is  the first x-ray that was conducted.

0:15:11.840,0:15:17.560
And they found out that the boy ingested a metallic cross object that we are seeing right there,

0:15:17.560,0:15:21.660
on the esophagus of the boy  before they came to SCOAN.

0:15:21.660,0:15:24.180
And after the prayer of the Man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:15:24.180,0:15:29.380
they went to the same hospital, conducted another test, ran an x-ray and that's what we are seeing

0:15:29.380,0:15:33.200
on the right hand side and find out that the boy is perfectly ok

0:15:33.200,0:15:40.080
and the object is no longer there.

0:15:40.080,0:15:46.200
The word of advice I'm giving to everyone, the world at large and the people viewing us,

0:15:46.200,0:15:51.660
watching the SCOAN service. The advice I'm giving to you is that: no matter the challenges and oppositions

0:15:51.660,0:15:55.380
of life, you are facing, no matter the temptations no matter the tests -

0:15:55.380,0:16:00.740
God is the last bus stop, always seek Him and always believe in Him.

0:16:00.740,0:16:06.480
Because it is not he that wrote your first letter that will ever determine your final results.

0:16:06.480,0:16:11.980
But He who will write your final letter will determine your final results and that person is Jesus Christ.

0:16:11.980,0:16:18.540
Indeed, Jehovah has the final say. Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.

0:16:18.540,0:16:27.900
What I want to tell the mothers is: when something happens to you like this, trust in God.

0:16:27.900,0:16:39.300
God can do anything. And even when you carry baby in your hands, be careful and watchful for the baby.

0:16:39.300,0:16:43.800
That was word of advice from madam Gift Stephen. Now we want to encourage the family.

0:16:43.800,0:16:51.100
That now the Lord has set your son free; as the Scripture says: "As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord."

0:16:51.100,0:16:56.080
We want you and your family to go and serve the Lord, in Spirit and in truth

0:16:56.080,0:17:01.960
and train the child in the way of the Lord. And we pray that God Almighty will grant you and your family,

0:17:01.960,0:17:04.360
the grace to do so, in Jesus' name.

0:17:04.360,0:17:07.900
Once again shall we put our hands together for the miracle working God.
