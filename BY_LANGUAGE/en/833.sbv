0:00:00.000,0:00:06.700
Right now, open you lips and begin to remove every challenge that stands against you.

0:00:06.700,0:00:09.480
You demon, you are the challenger.

0:00:09.480,0:00:19.500
We say to you right now,

0:00:19.500,0:00:21.720
come out!

0:00:21.720,0:00:26.200
Come out of my life, business and finances.

0:00:26.200,0:00:29.340
We say, come out!

0:00:29.340,0:00:34.480
Be cast out!

0:00:34.480,0:00:37.780
Begin to cast them out!

0:00:37.780,0:00:40.840
You demon!

0:00:40.840,0:01:01.680
Manifestation Of Evil Spirits

0:01:01.680,0:01:06.480
During the powerful mass prayer by T.B. Joshua, in the name of Jesus Christ,

0:01:06.480,0:01:13.460
the evil spirit inside this man is severely tormented as it is scorched by the fire of the Holy Ghost.

0:01:13.460,0:01:16.340
Let's hear its confession.

0:01:16.340,0:01:19.620
I am a destroyer.

0:01:19.620,0:01:20.640
The spirit of destroyer.

0:01:20.640,0:01:23.200
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:23.200,0:01:24.280
[Amen.]

0:01:24.280,0:01:27.780
A Word from God can change your situation.

0:01:27.780,0:01:31.080
A Word from God can revise your situation.

0:01:31.080,0:01:34.220
The Word from God can settle the matter.

0:01:34.220,0:01:38.540
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:38.540,0:01:44.100
Children of God - Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:44.100,0:01:47.280
My name is Christian Attah, I'm from Kogi State.

0:01:47.280,0:01:51.160
The woman standing beside me is my lovely wife.

0:01:51.160,0:01:53.320
This is my daughter: Angel.

0:01:53.320,0:01:57.040
This is my dad: Mr. Attah.

0:01:57.040,0:01:59.040
This is my son.

0:01:59.040,0:02:02.060
This is my lovely mum: Mrs. Attah.

0:02:02.060,0:02:05.760
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:02:05.760,0:02:15.440
I was delivered, last Sunday, when the man of God was conducting the mass prayer.

0:02:15.440,0:02:25.920
He was just praying against every evil spirit causing hindrance and setback.

0:02:25.920,0:02:29.000
We started praying that prayer along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:02:29.000,0:02:33.900
Suddenly, where I was praying at the back, I found myself on the floor, screaming.

0:02:33.900,0:02:36.020
I wanted to remove my clothes!

0:02:36.020,0:02:39.640
By the time I came round, I found myself at the altar.

0:02:39.640,0:02:48.560
It all started on December 25th, 2004, when I was at school.

0:02:48.560,0:02:55.560
My friends took me out to a club where people were smoking and drinking.

0:02:55.560,0:02:58.080
They asked me if I was going to smoke.

0:02:58.080,0:03:06.220
I told them I hadn't smoked before and that my father didn't smoke or drink, so why would I start smoking?

0:03:06.220,0:03:09.060
They said I should forget about that because I was at school

0:03:09.060,0:03:12.600
and my parents were not with me – I needed to smoke.

0:03:12.600,0:03:14.960
From then, I started smoking.

0:03:14.960,0:03:21.520
After smoking, I began taking hard drugs and drinking alcohol.

0:03:21.520,0:03:31.460
One day, my friend took me to a place where gang members were.

0:03:31.460,0:03:34.720
At that place, where the gang members were gathering,

0:03:34.720,0:03:44.380
he told the members that he wanted to initiate me into their cult.

0:03:44.380,0:03:53.060
I said I didn’t want to join but they forced me, they gave me a drink and I was drunk.

0:03:53.060,0:03:59.600
Then, they beat me up seriously and gave me something to swallow.

0:03:59.600,0:04:04.700
Afterwards, they told me that no one should know that I belonged to a cult.

0:04:04.700,0:04:11.480
The next day, my friend called me and said that they wanted to go for an 'operation'.

0:04:11.480,0:04:15.100
He asked if I would follow them for the operation. I said no.

0:04:15.100,0:04:21.900
He said that it was my obligation to go and if I didn’t go, they would not see me as anything.

0:04:21.900,0:04:26.040
So, I went with them and they gave me a rifle.

0:04:26.040,0:04:28.740
We went to carry out the operation.

0:04:28.740,0:04:43.680
We got to a room with ladies inside, we took their phones, chains and all they had, then left.

0:04:43.680,0:04:47.940
You mean your colleagues called you and all of you went for what?

0:04:47.940,0:04:49.360
We went to do robbery.

0:04:49.360,0:04:51.040
- OK, robbery?
- Yes.

0:04:51.040,0:05:03.140
When we went, we abused the ladies who didn’t want to give us their money or their chains,

0:05:03.140,0:05:05.300
then they would give us their money and we would let them go.

0:05:05.300,0:05:11.040
When we got back, we would hand over the stolen goods to the senior man in the cult.

0:05:11.040,0:05:15.380
That was how my cultism started.

0:05:15.380,0:05:19.240
It affected me so badly.

0:05:19.240,0:05:26.960
At that time, I didn’t have all these tattoos on my body.

0:05:26.960,0:05:33.620
Because I was a cult member, I started getting all these tattoos.

0:05:33.620,0:05:35.940
Look at the screen of the TV.

0:05:35.940,0:05:42.460
Our brother is confessing how these evil spirits actually tormented his entire life,

0:05:42.460,0:05:47.080
to the extent that he decided to put tattoos all over his body.

0:05:47.080,0:05:50.120
He is here to tell us the exact meaning of these tattoos.

0:05:50.120,0:05:53.500
Could you explain how you came about these tattoos and their meanings?

0:05:53.500,0:06:02.820
By the tattoo on my neck,

0:06:02.820,0:06:14.160
any cultist from my former group who sees it, would know that I was a member.

0:06:14.160,0:06:16.100
Watch the screen of the TV.

0:06:16.100,0:06:25.120
We heard him explaining - he said the very tattoo on his neck is the tattoo of identification,

0:06:25.120,0:06:29.820
indicating that he belongs to a certain secret cult.

0:06:29.820,0:06:38.740
When I started drawing all these tattoos, it affected my life badly.

0:06:38.740,0:06:48.000
Sometimes, the spirit would push me to go and smoke and rob.

0:06:48.000,0:06:52.880
Especially this tattoo by my eye.

0:06:52.880,0:06:55.600
If I didn’t have money, my eyes would be red.

0:06:55.600,0:06:59.520
I would start looking for money to take drugs.

0:06:59.520,0:07:01.600
What is the meaning of the tattoo on your eyes?

0:07:01.600,0:07:03.920
These are 'tears of joy'.

0:07:03.920,0:07:05.240
OK, you call it 'tears of joy'?

0:07:05.240,0:07:05.860
Yes.

0:07:05.860,0:07:08.080
Are they really tears of joy?

0:07:08.080,0:07:12.900
To me, it doesn’t mean tears of joy but tears of sorrow.

0:07:12.900,0:07:18.020
Because I collected something by force that didn’t belong to me.

0:07:18.020,0:07:20.660
It means sorrow to me.

0:07:20.660,0:07:22.160
You mean, they are 'tears of sorrow'?

0:07:22.160,0:07:22.660
Yes.

0:07:22.660,0:07:28.660
Because you go about harassing people, and taking their things by force?

0:07:28.660,0:07:42.140
Even if my dad was talking to me, he could not look at my eyes, I would get angry.

0:07:42.140,0:07:48.060
If I was fighting with my friends, only until I saw blood, before my eyes would come down.

0:07:48.060,0:07:52.540
OK, in the course of your testimony you said you were fond of collecting things from people by force.

0:07:52.540,0:07:54.720
What do you mean by that?

0:07:54.720,0:08:03.540
Stealing people's money – I would use everything I had to collect money by force.

0:08:03.540,0:08:05.580
What were the weapons you used?

0:08:05.580,0:08:12.820
We used knives, guns and sometimes, we would use sticks as if they were guns.

0:08:12.820,0:08:14.960
Continue.

0:08:14.960,0:08:26.640
When I would come home, my younger ones would see me smoking and drinking.

0:08:26.640,0:08:32.520
That spirit influenced them and now, they are smoking even more than me.

0:08:32.520,0:08:40.200
I didn’t have any way to control them, I am the eldest in the house.

0:08:40.200,0:08:49.800
The way I behaved, they were learning from me; now, I'm delivered, I can see that those things are not good.

0:08:49.800,0:08:55.440
When I see my younger ones smoking and drinking, it's very painful because it destroys;

0:08:55.440,0:08:59.080
it doesn’t make someone move forward but backwards.

0:08:59.080,0:09:05.480
OK, can you just tell us how these evil spirits actually affected your relationship with your wife?

0:09:05.480,0:09:17.120
Sometimes, I would go out and by the time I got in, my wife would ask me

0:09:17.120,0:09:23.560
why I was going out to drink that it wasn’t good, I should consider that she was pregnant.

0:09:23.560,0:09:27.560
I would just look at her in annoyance and start beating her seriously.

0:09:27.560,0:09:33.040
There was a time I beat her to the extent that blood started flowing out of her.

0:09:33.040,0:09:40.040
You mean this demon that tormented your life made you to beat up your wife, even when she was pregnant?

0:09:40.040,0:09:42.320
Yes, I used to beat her.

0:09:42.320,0:09:47.680
Anything she said, even if it was very minor that spirit would

0:09:47.680,0:09:51.000
come into me and tell me to beat my wife and kill her.

0:09:51.000,0:09:58.620
I would press her neck, until my parents would come and rescue her from my hand.

0:09:58.620,0:10:02.860
You mean you did beat her to the extent that she was bleeding whilst she was pregnant?

0:10:02.860,0:10:04.140
Yes.

0:10:04.140,0:10:06.920
You never felt any kind of remorse?

0:10:06.920,0:10:13.840
That was then, I didn’t regret anything but now I am delivered, I don’t beat my wife any more.

0:10:13.840,0:10:14.620
OK, hold on.

0:10:14.620,0:10:17.780
Before we go to your experience after your deliverance, we have questions to ask you.

0:10:17.780,0:10:19.620
Let's come to your mum and your dad.

0:10:19.620,0:10:24.540
How did these evil spirits affect your relationship with your mum and your dad?

0:10:24.540,0:10:33.680
The evil spirit affected my mum's business so much because of the things I was doing,

0:10:33.680,0:10:37.320
they would call me to ask why I was doing all these things.

0:10:37.320,0:10:41.620
I even went somewhere to do a charm for my dad

0:10:41.620,0:10:44.880
so that anyone who wanted to help my dad should not help him.

0:10:44.880,0:10:54.440
I did that because of the day he called police and had me arrested.

0:10:54.440,0:11:01.280
This was the reason why I did it - that he would not see help from anywhere.

0:11:01.280,0:11:05.520
OK, could you just tell us what led your father to carry out that action on you?

0:11:05.520,0:11:06.840
What were you doing to your dad?

0:11:06.840,0:11:09.540
Tell us how these evil spirits affected your relationship with your dad.

0:11:09.540,0:11:13.920
I didn’t respect him; I didn’t even see him as my dad.

0:11:13.920,0:11:19.600
It was to the extent that if he wanted to slap me, I would hold him too and wanted to fight back.

0:11:19.600,0:11:25.760
It even led to misunderstanding between my mum and dad.

0:11:25.760,0:11:34.940
My dad said that he would disown me and I was not the only son he had.

0:11:34.940,0:11:46.840
But my mum didn’t agree and that was how everything happened.

0:11:46.840,0:11:50.160
OK. Now, can we come to when you were delivered?

0:11:50.160,0:11:52.660
How did you come to know about The SCOAN?

0:11:52.660,0:11:54.900
And when you came - tell us what happened to you.

0:11:54.900,0:11:57.480
It was my mum who forced me to The SCOAN!

0:11:57.480,0:12:04.960
Last Sunday, when I was in the church, the evil spirit told me that I should go and I did.

0:12:04.960,0:12:12.500
When I left, my mum was looking for me all over, then she sent my younger one to look for me.

0:12:12.500,0:12:16.540
My younger one saw me and called me back inside; when I came back,

0:12:16.540,0:12:23.140
the spirit was pushing me to go out and smoke, asking me why I was staying in the church.

0:12:23.140,0:12:27.520
When I came back, my mum was angry with me and asked me why I went out.

0:12:27.520,0:12:31.060
I didn’t even answer her.

0:12:31.060,0:12:36.060
During the mass prayer, I didn’t know what came over me.

0:12:36.060,0:12:42.820
There was something like fire that was burning inside me, so I wanted to take off my clothes!

0:12:42.820,0:12:50.700
I wanted to run away but I felt chained down; the Spirit of God did not allow me to go out.

0:12:50.700,0:12:57.300
Eventually, I fell down and saw myself at the altar.

0:12:57.300,0:13:01.160
OK, can you tell us - ever since you have been delivered,

0:13:01.160,0:13:05.780
what are the changes you have noticed in your life and in relations with your family?

0:13:05.780,0:13:10.440
Now, I love my wife; we are on good terms.

0:13:10.440,0:13:16.920
I no longer go out with friends, I even broke my SIM, so those bad friends can't call me again.

0:13:16.920,0:13:17.940
I don't go out.

0:13:17.940,0:13:23.220
When my mum is talking to me now, I always listen to her.

0:13:23.220,0:13:27.300
This tattoo on my arm, I used it to deceive ladies.

0:13:27.300,0:13:35.520
Sometimes, I would take a lady out, telling her that I wanted to help her.

0:13:35.520,0:13:43.080
I would take her to a hotel room and she would think it was only me who wanted to sleep with her

0:13:43.080,0:13:45.620
but when we got to the hotel room, we would drug her

0:13:45.620,0:13:49.480
and she would not know what was happening, a group of us would abuse her.

0:13:49.480,0:13:54.340
This tattoo is the head of an eagle.

0:13:54.340,0:13:57.060
OK, the head of an eagle?

0:13:57.060,0:14:01.620
Since I am delivered, I no longer smoke.

0:14:01.620,0:14:06.780
The day I was delivered, I had a dream.

0:14:06.780,0:14:10.660
I saw my friends in a place where they were smoking.

0:14:10.660,0:14:16.520
They called me to join them to smoke and I went.

0:14:16.520,0:14:19.560
I took a drag of a cigarette and took a second one;

0:14:19.560,0:14:24.940
on the third drag, I was about to take, something started coming out of my nose.

0:14:24.940,0:14:28.340
Then, a voice told me to look at my left.

0:14:28.340,0:14:34.340
When I looked at my left, I saw worldly people, then I looked at my right

0:14:34.340,0:14:37.960
I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua holding my hand.

0:14:37.960,0:14:48.760
Holding my hand, Prophet T.B. Joshua took me to a room where people were singing praises.

0:14:48.760,0:14:52.520
Someone was sat on a throne and there was light.

0:14:52.520,0:14:59.200
I asked the man of God if I could see the person sitting on the throne.

0:14:59.200,0:15:05.080
He asked if I had eyes to see and if God gave me eyes to see the person, would I be able to stand?

0:15:05.080,0:15:07.180
I said that I wanted to see the person.

0:15:07.180,0:15:10.440
Next, I heard a loud voice from the throne.

0:15:10.440,0:15:14.000
He said, "Christian, do you know the meaning of Christian?"

0:15:14.000,0:15:20.880
I said no. He said, Christian is Christ-like and that I needed to follow the way of Christ.

0:15:20.880,0:15:22.120
That is the meaning of Christian.

0:15:22.120,0:15:23.560
Then, I woke up from the dream.

0:15:23.560,0:15:30.540
Wow, shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:15:30.540,0:15:34.920
This is a clear proof that indeed the deliverance the brother has received here,

0:15:34.920,0:15:39.580
at The SCOAN, the arena of liberty, is genuine.

0:15:39.580,0:15:44.140
Of course, the dream has gone as far as telling him the meaning of being a Christian.

0:15:44.140,0:15:46.060
This means a Christ-like person.

0:15:46.060,0:15:49.440
In other words he should make the Word of God the standard for his life

0:15:49.440,0:15:51.760
and follow Jesus Christ for the rest of his life.

0:15:51.760,0:15:54.820
Shall we put our hands together beautifully.

0:15:54.820,0:15:59.940
Now, as you are completely delivered - can you tell us how you relate with your mum, dad and wife?

0:15:59.940,0:16:08.400
We are all happy now and things I didn’t do for my mum before, I am doing now.

0:16:08.400,0:16:14.140
Now, we are at peace and between me and my wife there is peace.

0:16:14.140,0:16:16.540
Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that.

0:16:16.540,0:16:17.800
Madam, welcome in Jesus' name.

0:16:17.800,0:16:20.660
We believe this is a day of your joy.

0:16:20.660,0:16:24.660
Could you just tell us your name and your own side of the story?

0:16:29.560,0:16:34.440
My name is Rita Attah, I'm from Kogi State.

0:16:34.440,0:16:39.320
People of God - my testimony goes like this:

0:16:39.320,0:16:48.280
when I met my husband, he was smoking, drinking, womanising, always going to clubs.

0:16:48.280,0:17:04.140
I didn't know that my husband was acting like that after having taken different drugs.

0:17:04.140,0:17:14.620
Each time I asked him about this going out he would start beating me up.

0:17:14.620,0:17:19.740
He would lay his hand on me even while I was pregnant.

0:17:19.740,0:17:31.900
The reason for which I am here is to testify that my husband does not do those things any more.

0:17:31.900,0:17:39.400
The smoking, drinking, going out to clubs, womanising - my husband does not do those things any more.

0:17:39.400,0:17:49.680
My husband stays at home, ministers the Anointing Water, reads the Bible and prays - he gathers our family...

0:17:49.680,0:17:55.480

0:17:55.480,0:17:56.400
To God be the glory.

0:17:56.400,0:17:58.020
We thank God Almighty for your life.

0:17:58.020,0:18:02.140
Let's hear from the father of your husband.

0:18:02.140,0:18:08.000
People of God - Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:18:08.000,0:18:14.160
My name is Samson Attah, I'm from Kogi State.

0:18:14.160,0:18:19.440
Today is a great day for me.

0:18:19.440,0:18:24.400
I've suffered a lot because of my first son.

0:18:24.400,0:18:36.660
My son was born in 1985.

0:18:36.660,0:18:43.540
My son was well till the age of eleven years.

0:18:43.540,0:18:53.340
When I moved to Lagos, I started to notice something about my son.

0:18:53.340,0:18:59.080
When I called him, he wouldn't answer my call.

0:18:59.080,0:19:01.060
There was no respect.

0:19:01.060,0:19:09.140
I told my wife that I noticed something about our son - Christian.

0:19:09.140,0:19:17.440
He would not even like to attend the morning devotion.

0:19:17.440,0:19:20.520
The rest of children would attend the morning devotion.

0:19:20.520,0:19:32.160
Whenever I called him to attend morning devotion, he wouldn't like to answer me.

0:19:32.160,0:19:34.800
I started to notice some things.

0:19:34.800,0:19:43.180
He changed entirely at the age of 15, after finishing secondary school.

0:19:43.180,0:19:54.600
I told him I didn't like his friends, that he should go away from them, and their way of living was bad.

0:19:54.600,0:19:59.960
Then the battle between me and my son began.

0:19:59.960,0:20:05.740
When I advised him like that, he would insult me.

0:20:05.740,0:20:10.740
When he began to insult me, the younger son would attack him.

0:20:10.740,0:20:19.940
One day, when he was insulting me, I slapped him and he held my hand and wanted to beat me.

0:20:19.940,0:20:25.380
The junior one insulted him and he was holding him.

0:20:25.380,0:20:35.820
Because of that he made a comment that he would call a gang, and I would not see that boy again,

0:20:35.820,0:20:40.060
and the following day I would see him dead on the street.

0:20:40.060,0:20:48.720
I called my wife and I said that this boy had gone far towards "something".

0:20:48.720,0:20:52.480
One day I came while he was sleeping...

0:20:52.480,0:20:56.980
The tattoo on the arm was his first one.

0:20:56.980,0:21:04.740
When I saw the tattoo, I asked my son what the meaning of it was.

0:21:04.740,0:21:13.360
He started telling me that this didn't concern me, and I should not ask him.

0:21:13.360,0:21:21.800
One day, he gathered a group of people - cult members on the street.

0:21:21.800,0:21:31.240
They were fighting with broken bottles and jumping over the fence.

0:21:31.240,0:21:40.200
Then, my junior son came - he saw that Christian and his group wanted to kill someone.

0:21:40.200,0:21:41.920
I was laying on my bed.

0:21:41.920,0:21:50.540
When I got up, I looked through the window and I saw him and people that were coming.

0:21:50.540,0:21:55.760
I fainted.

0:21:55.760,0:22:01.060
I did not know what was happening for more than one hour.

0:22:01.060,0:22:12.040
I saw those things: the broken bottles, someone being injured - so I fainted.

0:22:12.040,0:22:24.580
Then I told my wife that I would report this boy to the police, so they would arrest him.

0:22:24.580,0:22:34.540
Since he wanted to kill the junior son, one day we might not see our son any more.

0:22:34.540,0:22:40.840
My wife said that we should wait and not go to the police.

0:22:40.840,0:22:42.420
I said OK.

0:22:42.420,0:22:45.280
After that he started again.

0:22:45.280,0:22:46.880
I called him - he refused to come.

0:22:46.880,0:22:57.000
And now the worst thing happened - he polluted the minds of the junior ones.

0:22:57.000,0:23:04.300
They used to come to the morning devotion before - he told them many things.

0:23:04.300,0:23:08.720
Those who were not smoking before started to smoke.

0:23:08.720,0:23:21.540
Those that had not been stealing before - he told them how to make money faster than me, as a father, did.

0:23:21.540,0:23:26.300
When I called them, they did not listen to me any more.

0:23:26.300,0:23:31.820
Everything was tough between me and him.

0:23:31.820,0:23:39.640
One day, I told him that I would disown him.

0:23:39.640,0:23:44.960
He started fighting me.

0:23:44.960,0:23:49.140
Then I met with my second son and my wife.

0:23:49.140,0:23:57.780
The three of us tried to keep and beat him - we couldn't do that.

0:23:57.780,0:24:06.620
Then I escaped because he was focused on me.

0:24:06.620,0:24:12.520
Whatever I did or said, it was like fire for him.

0:24:12.520,0:24:14.520
He didn't want to see me at all.

0:24:14.520,0:24:15.960
I told my wife...

0:24:15.960,0:24:27.940
One day he gathered some people to kill me because I was the one giving him a tough time.

0:24:27.940,0:24:30.720
I was the one troubling him - he wanted to kill me.

0:24:30.720,0:24:53.920
When this information came to me, I escaped because this boy with other people was ready to kill me.

0:24:53.920,0:25:04.860
It was last year - January 11th - I made up my mind to quit my house.

0:25:04.860,0:25:12.620
That day I run away to Ghana.

0:25:12.620,0:25:18.780
I went to my friend and stayed there to save my life.

0:25:18.780,0:25:24.280
I told my wife that I would not come back until this boy was delivered.

0:25:24.280,0:25:28.320
Otherwise he would take my life.

0:25:28.320,0:25:39.780
When I went to Ghana, I asked my friend - we began to pray.

0:25:39.780,0:25:46.480
This is my first son - I have suffered a lot; all my businesses collapsed.

0:25:46.480,0:25:48.560
There was no one to take care of my business.

0:25:48.560,0:25:52.220
There was no money for me anymore.

0:25:52.220,0:25:53.720
We continued to pray.

0:25:53.720,0:25:59.760
I was praying for my first son to be delivered; Christian to be delivered -

0:25:59.760,0:26:04.860
that was my prayer point number one.

0:26:04.860,0:26:14.860
I, my friend and his wife were praying together three weeks ago.

0:26:14.860,0:26:33.200
Then our Prophet appeared to me in the dream.

0:26:33.200,0:26:37.520
That was three weeks ago.

0:26:37.520,0:26:50.340
Prophet said, "Son, you should not worry. The answer to your prayer has come. The whole thing is settled."

0:26:50.340,0:26:55.500
Immediately I heard that voice, I woke up.

0:26:55.500,0:26:58.920
In the morning I called my wife.

0:26:58.920,0:27:10.160
I said that I had been praying and that I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in my dream.

0:27:10.160,0:27:20.240
He said that the case of my son Christian was settled and that I should take all of them to the church.

0:27:20.240,0:27:25.400
Since the Prophet said the case was settled, I believed it.

0:27:25.400,0:27:33.540
Last Sunday, my wife brought all of them here.

0:27:33.540,0:27:35.460
I started with Emmanuel TV

0:27:35.460,0:27:45.760
because Emmanuel TV is my friend, mother, father, wife, it is my everything.

0:27:45.760,0:27:52.960
I sleep and wake up with Emmanuel TV.

0:27:52.960,0:28:01.340
Last Sunday in the morning I was watching Emmanuel TV.

0:28:01.340,0:28:08.680
I was watching the prayer, the testimonies...

0:28:08.680,0:28:21.500
When the man of God appeared and prophesied to people, I asked God, "Please, locate my son".

0:28:21.500,0:28:28.360
As I was watching, I saw some people coming out.

0:28:28.360,0:28:31.320
One lady came out, then another lady came out.

0:28:31.320,0:28:32.360
I continued to pray.

0:28:32.360,0:28:39.540
I opened my eyes and I saw my son in the front of the altar.

0:28:39.540,0:28:40.960
That is not enough for Jesus Christ!

0:28:40.960,0:28:47.220
Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:28:47.220,0:28:56.000
When they brought him out, he was saying, "I destroy, I destroy".

0:28:56.000,0:28:58.320
I started to see all these things.

0:28:58.320,0:29:04.000
I said, "God - You are wonderful".

0:29:04.000,0:29:13.060
As he entered the arena of liberty, all the problems were settled.

0:29:13.060,0:29:16.620
That is how I gave thanks to my God.

0:29:16.620,0:29:26.220
When I was in Lagos, my son didn't talk to me, he didn't call me, he didn't want to see me.

0:29:26.220,0:29:33.040
After I went to Ghana, he didn't call me even once, he didn't think about me.

0:29:33.040,0:29:40.220
On Tuesday morning...

0:29:40.220,0:29:41.660
You mean after his deliverance?

0:29:41.660,0:29:45.460
After his deliverance on Sunday.

0:29:45.460,0:29:47.000
On Monday...

0:29:47.000,0:29:51.180
On Tuesday in the morning there was I call.

0:29:51.180,0:29:56.880
Since my son was not calling me, I didn't know his number.

0:29:56.880,0:29:58.760
I didn't even think about my son.

0:29:58.760,0:30:04.640
The only call I was expecting from Nigeria was from my wife.

0:30:04.640,0:30:08.980
I used to talk with my wife every day.

0:30:08.980,0:30:11.200
So the call came in.

0:30:11.200,0:30:14.320
He said, "Good morning, daddy".

0:30:14.320,0:30:15.920
I asked, "Who is this?"

0:30:15.920,0:30:18.240
I asked, "Is it Israel?"

0:30:18.240,0:30:23.380
He said, "No. I'm Christian - your first son".

0:30:23.380,0:30:28.140
I answered, "Mr. Attah speaking. Is it a mistake?"

0:30:28.140,0:30:37.120
Mr Samson Attah & Family
Deliverance Testimony

0:30:37.120,0:30:46.180
I said, "No. It might be a wrong number. This is Mr. Attah talking. Who are you?"

0:30:46.180,0:30:51.080
He said, "I'm Christian - your first son. It is not a mistake.

0:30:51.080,0:30:55.820
I collected your number from my mum on Monday."

0:30:55.820,0:30:56.860
I said, "You!?"

0:30:56.860,0:30:57.700
He said, "Yes."

0:30:57.700,0:31:03.260
I said, "Yes, my prayer has been answered because I saw you."

0:31:03.260,0:31:11.040
Mr Samson Attah & Family
Deliverance Testimony

0:31:11.040,0:31:13.520
God has answered my prayer.

0:31:13.520,0:31:21.060
Because God spoke to me in the dream through Prophet T.B. Joshua saying that the case was settled,

0:31:21.060,0:31:22.780
I knew that the case was settled.

0:31:22.780,0:31:29.440
My son said, "Dad, I want you to come to Nigeria. I want to sit down and discuss with you."

0:31:29.440,0:31:31.300
I asked, "Should I come?"

0:31:31.300,0:31:42.840
I was not sure because maybe he had gathered some gang to attack me - so I had to call my wife.

0:31:42.840,0:31:43.820
I called my wife.

0:31:43.820,0:31:49.500
I told my wife that I had a call from Christian.

0:31:49.500,0:31:54.840
He said that I should come to Lagos, Nigeria.

0:31:54.840,0:31:58.060
I asked my wife if it was indeed him with her.

0:31:58.060,0:32:05.560
She said, "He asked me for your number and I gave it to him."

0:32:05.560,0:32:12.340
I asked, "Have you confirmed that nothing would happen to me if I returned?"

0:32:12.340,0:32:18.160
She said, "Yes, you should come - it is confirmed."

0:32:18.160,0:32:20.780
I came back in the night.

0:32:20.780,0:32:27.940
Since all these things started, he never hugged me.

0:32:27.940,0:32:40.600
That day I came - Wednesday - when I reached the house, he was the first person than run and hugged me.

0:32:40.600,0:32:47.960
Mr Samson Attah & Family
Deliverance Testimony

0:32:47.960,0:32:53.500
When he hugged me, I looked at him and started shedding tears.

0:32:53.500,0:32:57.300
Yesterday he came to me.

0:32:57.300,0:32:59.360
He didn't discuss anything with me before.

0:32:59.360,0:33:10.080
When he came to me, he said, "Dad, if you have any dirty clothes for me to wash and iron for you...

0:33:10.080,0:33:14.960
On Sunday we will go to church."

0:33:14.960,0:33:23.580
I said, "I ironed all my clothes before coming back from Ghana. So, there is no problem".

0:33:23.580,0:33:29.600
I said to him that if he wanted us to go to the church, I was ready to go.

0:33:29.600,0:33:30.680
He said, "OK".

0:33:30.680,0:33:35.580
These things have not been seen before.

0:33:35.580,0:33:39.640
It used to be like cat and rat, lion in the house.

0:33:39.640,0:33:42.040
Everything was disorganized.

0:33:42.040,0:33:51.620
This boy used to beat his pregnant wife.

0:33:51.620,0:33:53.460
That was before he was delivered?

0:33:53.460,0:33:55.060
That was before he was delivered.

0:33:55.060,0:34:10.440
Now, when his wife carries water to the bathroom, they go together, bathing together...

0:34:10.440,0:34:12.020
It is wonderful.

0:34:12.020,0:34:16.280
I am happy today.

0:34:16.280,0:34:18.280
To God be the glory.

0:34:18.280,0:34:24.160
Once again, let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.

0:34:24.160,0:34:30.080
Yes sir, we will get back to you to hear your words of advice, especially to parents,

0:34:30.080,0:34:33.500
but before, we want to hear from the mum.

0:34:33.500,0:34:36.020
God is wonderful.

0:34:36.020,0:34:43.980
Especially, the God of T.B. Joshua is a wonderful God.

0:34:43.980,0:34:48.280
My name is Mrs Attah.

0:34:48.280,0:34:58.320
The boy beside me is my first son and his wife.

0:34:58.320,0:35:02.820
This is my loving husband.

0:35:02.820,0:35:13.220
Because of my son, our love divided but I am thanking God today.

0:35:13.220,0:35:17.240
My testimony goes like this.

0:35:17.240,0:35:30.180
When I married my husband, his grandfather was the one who married us.

0:35:30.180,0:35:33.720
His grandfather was a native doctor.

0:35:33.720,0:35:42.100
When I was pregnant, I gave birth to a baby boy who is this Christian Attah.

0:35:42.100,0:35:51.880
Seven days after his birth, we gave him the name of the grandfather

0:35:51.880,0:35:56.140
which was the first name before we gave him Christian.

0:35:56.140,0:35:59.060
We gave him the name Abata.

0:35:59.060,0:36:15.900
When my son grew to about five years old, ten, eleven and fourteen, he started behaving waywardly.

0:36:15.900,0:36:20.540
When he went out, sometimes three days would pass before he came home.

0:36:20.540,0:36:30.200
They used to call me and say that my son was fighting somewhere.

0:36:30.200,0:36:38.960
When I got there, I would see my son with a glass bottle or a knife fighting.

0:36:38.960,0:36:42.260
I would hold Christian and ask him what his problem was.

0:36:42.260,0:36:52.900
When we finished secondary school, we asked Christian what he wanted to do.

0:36:52.900,0:36:54.860
He replied that he wanted to be a solider.

0:36:54.860,0:37:00.100
I said he should join but I did not know that the army he joined

0:37:00.100,0:37:05.860
was doing armed robbery and putting tattoos on his body.

When Prophet T.B. Joshua began the mass prayer, God Almighty arrested my son.

0:37:18.560,0:37:24.100
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:37:24.100,0:37:29.020
Since your son has been delivered, what are the changes you have seen in his life?

0:37:29.020,0:37:35.160
Since that Sunday when my son was delivered, I have been happy.

0:37:35.160,0:37:38.640
What my son couldn’t ask me for before, he now asks me.

0:37:38.640,0:37:42.600
First of all, he asked me for his dad's phone number.

0:37:42.600,0:37:46.140
Since then, my son's character has changed.

0:37:46.140,0:37:48.420
He doesn’t go out anymore.

0:37:48.420,0:38:00.040
Sometimes, he calls his junior ones to sit down with them and talk to them.

0:38:00.040,0:38:02.860
This is what my son would never do before.

0:38:02.860,0:38:06.820
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:38:06.820,0:38:11.740
Yes, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life, in the life of your son and also the entire family.

0:38:11.740,0:38:15.540
Now, what word of advice do you have for parents and everyone?

0:38:15.540,0:38:20.480
I pray that God will answer those who have the same problem I once had,

0:38:20.480,0:38:23.740
in the same way He answered me, in Jesus' name.

0:38:23.740,0:38:27.880
Amen. Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.

0:38:27.880,0:38:33.080
Now, let's hear the word of advice from Christian.

0:38:33.080,0:38:35.820
My word of advice goes like this.

0:38:35.820,0:38:44.080
In Romans 12:1 it says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren…

0:38:44.080,0:38:47.620
Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that.

0:38:47.620,0:38:48.500
To God be the glory.

0:38:48.500,0:38:50.780
You can see the whole church is happy with you.

0:38:50.780,0:38:53.700
I believe that is how the Kingdom of Heaven is rejoicing because of your deliverance.

0:38:53.700,0:38:58.520
In Romans 12:1 it says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God,

0:38:58.520,0:39:02.220
that we may present our bodies holy and acceptable unto God."

0:39:02.220,0:39:08.220
So, what I want to tell the youth is to present themselves in a way that is acceptable to God.

0:39:08.220,0:39:13.900
The worldly things I was into before don’t make sense.

0:39:13.900,0:39:23.080
Now, I thank God that He delivered me and the same God that delivered me will deliver you too.

0:39:23.080,0:39:30.560
The same Christian that was carrying cutlass, guns and knife is now carrying the Holy Bible.

0:39:30.560,0:39:31.560
I thank God.

0:39:31.560,0:39:35.600
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:39:35.600,0:39:36.760
To God be the glory.

0:39:36.760,0:39:41.740
Let's hear finally from your dad - a word of advice.

0:39:41.740,0:39:51.800
The word of my advice is that as parents we should monitor our children - the way they behave.

0:39:51.800,0:39:58.820
I want you to know that this battle for our children is not physical.

0:39:58.820,0:40:07.940
I have "used" police, my strength, the strength of my wife, my junior son, and everybody -

0:40:07.940,0:40:13.520
but prayer is the answer!

0:40:13.520,0:40:20.580
If anything affects your children, go into prayer.

0:40:20.580,0:40:22.560
That is my advice to all parents.

0:40:22.560,0:40:26.280
Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!

0:40:26.280,0:40:29.180
Indeed, prayer is the master key to loose and to bind.

0:40:29.180,0:40:32.640
We thank God Almighty for what He has accomplished first and foremost

0:40:32.640,0:40:34.880
in the life of your son Christian and the entire family.

0:40:34.880,0:40:39.700
I also want you to know that as much as your son is delivered through the Word of God,

0:40:39.700,0:40:43.700
we believe he has started the journey of salvation by making the Word of God

0:40:43.700,0:40:47.040
the standard for his life and of course for the entire family.

0:40:47.040,0:40:52.640
Always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough - the best is always yet to come.

0:40:52.640,0:40:56.260
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
