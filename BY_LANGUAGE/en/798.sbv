0:00:00.000,0:00:02.760
Faith is natural.

0:00:02.760,0:00:09.040
If something is natural, it means, with God.

0:00:09.040,0:00:16.280
If faith is natural, how do you receive that faith?

0:00:16.280,0:00:29.200
You do not need greater faith; you need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.

0:00:29.200,0:00:36.000
All you need to know is His faithfulness and trustworthiness, which you have received today.

0:00:36.000,0:00:41.820
"Be healed; be delivered; be set free" just like that.

0:00:41.820,0:00:52.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:52.220,0:01:04.380
The moment you know God is faithful and reliable, your faith grows spontaneously.

0:01:04.380,0:01:11.000
With what you have seen now the faith will begin to increase in you.

0:01:11.000,0:01:14.300
Faith in God.

0:01:14.300,0:01:28.120
If you were a "zero" before seeing it, you realise that you begin to have that desire just naturally.

0:01:28.120,0:01:38.560
The moment you realise that God is faithful, reliable and trustworthy, your faith grows spontaneously.

0:01:38.560,0:01:46.320
The moment you realise that God is reliable, your find yourself trusting in Him.

0:01:46.320,0:01:47.820
That is faith.

0:01:47.820,0:01:53.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:53.920,0:01:58.920
I want to believe that you are a man and a woman of faith.

0:01:58.920,0:01:59.800
[Amen.]

0:01:59.800,0:02:03.560
If I am talking - let me see your hand.

0:02:03.560,0:02:06.320
Now, you know what faith is.

0:02:06.320,0:02:11.620
Someone might say, "Until I read the Bible from the Genesis to the end.

0:02:11.620,0:02:15.240
I have not been going to the church; I don't have faith.

0:02:15.240,0:02:21.940
I'm not a bishop, I'm not an evangelist. This is my first time coming to church." - No.

0:02:21.940,0:02:26.820
The issue of faith - faith is natural.

0:02:26.820,0:02:32.060
Listen; you do not need greater faith.

0:02:32.060,0:02:37.840
All you need is faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.

0:02:37.840,0:02:41.020
What you have been seeing now shows that God is reliable.

0:02:41.020,0:02:51.900
The moment you realise that God is faithful and reliable, you find that your faith grows naturally.

0:02:51.900,0:03:00.720
When you leave here, you will go to your bedroom, go on your knees and start praying.

0:03:00.720,0:03:02.820
And it has not been like that before.

0:03:02.820,0:03:13.500
It shows that you began to trust someone, who is wiser than you, more clever and more trustworthy than you.

0:03:13.500,0:03:18.500
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:18.500,0:03:21.740
Something is growing now.

0:03:21.740,0:03:23.820
Something is growing.

0:03:23.820,0:03:26.580
Allow this to grow.

0:03:26.580,0:03:31.400
Anointing is the power of God.

0:03:31.400,0:03:35.700
The dividend of that power is what you have been seeing today.

0:03:35.700,0:03:40.300
The fruit of that power brings healing, salvation.

0:03:40.300,0:03:46.240
You see people getting healed, those who were crying for many years - just like that.

0:03:46.240,0:03:49.660
It was just a tap, not a slap.

0:03:49.660,0:03:55.560
If I slapped you you would feel it, "Man of God; you slapped me."

0:03:55.560,0:03:57.260
It was a tap.

0:03:57.260,0:04:01.100
There is a difference between tap and slap.

0:04:01.100,0:04:04.240
When you are fighting your neighbour - you slap

0:04:04.240,0:04:07.220
but when you tap - you tap a friend.

0:04:07.220,0:04:10.080
You slap your enemy.

0:04:10.080,0:04:16.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:16.000,0:04:20.860
If it was a slap; how many people I would be able to slap before getting tired?

0:04:20.860,0:04:24.540
Try to slap three people and see how would you feel.

0:04:24.540,0:04:25.800
You would get tired.

0:04:25.800,0:04:29.280
But you can tap a "trillion" people...

0:04:29.280,0:04:37.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:37.360,0:04:42.600
So, if it was to be a traditional way of praying...

0:04:42.600,0:04:45.020
The traditional way of praying is this.

0:04:45.020,0:04:49.020
In the name of Jesus - be healed.

0:04:49.020,0:04:53.620
How many people could I do this to?

0:04:53.620,0:04:57.860
Even the voice, "In the name of Jesus".

0:04:57.860,0:04:59.920
You will get tired after ten minutes.

0:04:59.920,0:05:01.540
OK, let me try.

0:05:01.540,0:05:06.300
In the name of Jesus - you are healed, in Jesus' name.

0:05:06.300,0:05:11.080
In the name of Jesus - be healed.

0:05:11.080,0:05:16.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:16.200,0:05:20.240
In the name of Jesus - be healed.

0:05:20.240,0:05:23.840
The person talking now Mr T.B. Joshua, not Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:05:23.840,0:05:28.100
If it was a Prophet you would fly.

0:05:28.100,0:05:32.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:32.320,0:05:36.500
You know I am a brother just like you.

0:05:36.500,0:05:39.860
It is not a Prophet who is talking now.

0:05:39.860,0:05:51.500
That is why I can touch you, "In the name of Jesus - be healed, in Jesus' name".

0:05:51.500,0:05:55.560
The method God has given me - look at it.

0:05:55.560,0:06:04.640
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:04.640,0:06:06.060
Can you see?

0:06:06.060,0:06:07.840
It is just like that.

0:06:07.840,0:06:10.140
I do not know how many...

0:06:10.140,0:06:13.920
If you say I should now carry on... that you know what I am saying.

0:06:13.920,0:06:18.100
In the name of Jesus.

0:06:18.100,0:06:20.500
This is crazy.

0:06:20.500,0:06:22.760
It is the light we carry.

0:06:22.760,0:06:28.060
Once you light this candle you just touch.

0:06:28.060,0:06:33.540
You just say once, "In the name of Jesus" - you can do the whole...

0:06:33.540,0:06:35.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:35.940,0:06:37.120
Are you with me?

0:06:37.120,0:06:38.260
[Yes.]

0:06:38.260,0:06:44.400
If I now begin to say, "In the name of Jesus - be healed"...

0:06:44.400,0:06:51.840
It is only one call that Jesus heard out of three of my calls.

0:06:51.840,0:06:58.560
It is an unbelief that made us to call that name for several hours.

0:06:58.560,0:07:01.920
If you understand let me see your hand.

0:07:01.920,0:07:09.260
Now, "In the name of Jesus -

0:07:09.260,0:07:10.140
be healed."

0:07:10.140,0:07:12.460
How many times?

0:07:12.460,0:07:13.700
Five times.

0:07:13.700,0:07:19.180
If that healing comes it was only once Jesus heard our call.

0:07:19.180,0:07:21.100
Other four...

0:07:21.100,0:07:25.500
Because that came our of unbelief.

0:07:25.500,0:07:32.000
It is just like a human being; if I come to my mummy here now, "Mummy, mummy, mummy".

0:07:32.000,0:07:33.260
By the time mummy hears...

0:07:33.260,0:07:38.700
She would only hear once and say, "Yes! What do you want?"

0:07:38.700,0:07:44.040
She would not begin to answer me three times, "Mummy - yes. Mummy - yes. Mummy - yes".

0:07:44.040,0:07:46.520
Mother would say that something is wrong.

0:07:46.520,0:07:54.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:54.880,0:07:59.180
These are our challenges.

0:07:59.180,0:08:02.160
We have them a lot.

0:08:02.160,0:08:06.700
When it comes to the things of the spirit we are all babies.

0:08:06.700,0:08:16.460
We that are working for God; there is so much fights in the church because we do not understand ourselves.

0:08:16.460,0:08:19.660
The journey is so difficult; we don't understand.

0:08:19.660,0:08:23.260
You don't even know if a given person is a man of God.

0:08:23.260,0:08:28.300
You, man of God, you don't know if another man of God is a true one.

0:08:28.300,0:08:31.100
Can you see how difficult the journey is?

0:08:31.100,0:08:32.000
Are you with me?

0:08:32.000,0:08:32.820
[Yes.]

0:08:32.820,0:08:41.540
Let me give you a good example, come brothers.

0:08:41.540,0:08:43.080
Stand here.

0:08:43.080,0:08:48.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:48.080,0:08:50.340
We are all ministers of God.

0:08:50.340,0:08:53.700
Could you believe that we may not even know that we are all ministers of God?

0:08:53.700,0:09:01.300
This one might not know that that one is a child of God like him, and he would be fighting him.

0:09:01.300,0:09:05.820
While this one too will continue to fight him...

0:09:05.820,0:09:07.080
Can you see?

0:09:07.080,0:09:08.540
What is the cause of this?

0:09:08.540,0:09:11.240
Why we don't even know ourselves?

0:09:11.240,0:09:13.760
Why?

0:09:13.760,0:09:16.660
It is because we don't know the strength of the ministry.

0:09:16.660,0:09:20.900
The strength of the ministry is not the crowd.

0:09:20.900,0:09:23.940
The strength of the ministry is not the number of people who worship

0:09:23.940,0:09:27.900
or the number of branches you have all over the world.

0:09:27.900,0:09:32.020
The strength of the ministry is the Holy Spirit.

0:09:32.020,0:09:36.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:36.360,0:09:41.880
There are many ministries of God that have five members and they are more anointed

0:09:41.880,0:09:46.360
then some ministries of God that have the biggest crowd in the world.

0:09:46.360,0:09:50.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:09:50.000,0:09:54.900
The fact that they know you all over the world does not mean that you are the most anointed person.

0:09:54.900,0:10:01.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:01.620,0:10:05.600
The fact that your ministry is known all over the world does not mean

0:10:05.600,0:10:08.680
you are the most anointed person in the world.

0:10:08.680,0:10:10.520
Men of God - they don't know that.

0:10:10.520,0:10:15.520
The fact that your church is the biggest one in the world does not mean that you are the most anointed person.

0:10:15.520,0:10:23.480
There are some ministries of five members that are more anointed than you.

0:10:23.480,0:10:29.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:29.220,0:10:32.840
The moment we know this, there would be no more fights.

0:10:32.840,0:10:35.500
We are running for members.

0:10:35.500,0:10:38.920
Everybody is trying to have the largest church in the world.

0:10:38.920,0:10:41.760
Everybody is trying to have branches everywhere.

0:10:41.760,0:10:45.240
Everybody is trying to have crowd, to be known.

0:10:45.240,0:10:47.440
Everybody is trying to be known all over the world.

0:10:47.440,0:10:49.380
This is the cause of fight.

0:10:49.380,0:10:54.900
We disregard the truth; the principle.

0:10:54.900,0:11:04.060
OK, if the ministry with the largest number of branches is the most anointed,

0:11:04.060,0:11:09.100
why The SCOAN is only in Ikotun-Egbe and it is known all over the world?

0:11:09.100,0:11:15.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:15.480,0:11:27.340
Here, in Ikotun-Egbe - a small village, there is only an arrow that links to the church,

0:11:27.340,0:11:31.200
and it is known all over the world.

0:11:31.200,0:11:42.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:42.660,0:11:50.040
We refuse to advertise our program in any channel, apart from Emmanuel TV.

0:11:50.040,0:11:54.100
You will not see the signboards anywhere in the world.

0:11:54.100,0:12:00.680
When you come here you will not see signboards showing the direction to the church.

0:12:00.680,0:12:10.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:10.660,0:12:12.460
Think about that.

0:12:12.460,0:12:17.220
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:17.220,0:12:22.300
We will never look for you if you don't come to the church.

0:12:22.300,0:12:29.660
Nobody will want to know your house and begin to disturb you, "Why did you not come to church?

0:12:29.660,0:12:35.240
What is the problem. You have to come to church. OK?"

0:12:35.240,0:12:40.280
You don't need to collect any letter if you want to leave this ministry

0:12:40.280,0:12:44.820
because I had never asked you for any letter before you came here.

0:12:44.820,0:12:53.360
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:53.360,0:12:56.840
We are talking about the strength of the ministry.

0:12:56.840,0:12:58.760
The strength of the ministry.

0:12:58.760,0:13:02.080
Once we know that - no problem.

0:13:02.080,0:13:04.900
Thank you brothers.

0:13:04.900,0:13:08.600
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:08.600,0:13:11.540
God has given us adverts.

0:13:11.540,0:13:13.920
God has given His ministry adverts.

0:13:13.920,0:13:18.460
Every living ministry has free adverts.

0:13:18.460,0:13:21.760
What you see about me is an advert to me.

0:13:21.760,0:13:23.620
When you leave here.

0:13:23.620,0:13:29.660
If you leave here today, tomorrow you go to the town and say, "That man is a devil, it is not a man of God" -

0:13:29.660,0:13:31.520
you are advertising me.

0:13:31.520,0:13:37.820
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:37.820,0:13:43.400
Or tomorrow you just leave here and say, "That church - don't go there. They used to tie people down.

0:13:43.400,0:13:45.000
It is a bad church."

0:13:45.000,0:13:47.640
You are indirectly advertising me.

0:13:47.640,0:13:55.380
Because the people you are telling it to will want to confirm if they truly tie people down.

0:13:55.380,0:14:00.940
By the time they come and find out that people are not tied down - they become members.

0:14:00.940,0:14:06.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:06.020,0:14:08.880
I have been using this advert for many years.

0:14:08.880,0:14:10.160
People don't know.

0:14:10.160,0:14:13.640
This is why I don't have sign posts.

0:14:13.640,0:14:14.560
No boards.

0:14:14.560,0:14:17.380
You cannot see signposts outside.

0:14:17.380,0:14:21.180
This an advert God has been giving me for past 30 years.

0:14:21.180,0:14:28.940
God said, "Don't have any signposts, signboards. People will advertise your ministry to the world."

0:14:28.940,0:14:32.320
Free of charge.

0:14:32.320,0:14:35.160
Thank you for your adverts.

0:14:35.160,0:14:38.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:38.020,0:14:41.860
So, you too; leave the truth to defend itself.

0:14:41.860,0:14:45.220
Let people advertise you.

0:14:45.220,0:14:47.880
Don't fight, whatever people say about you.

0:14:47.880,0:14:57.260
If truly you are genuine, whether they condemn you or spoil your name - it is for your good.

0:14:57.260,0:15:02.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:02.960,0:15:03.760
Take your time.

0:15:03.760,0:15:07.780
Just ask yourself what brought you here.

0:15:07.780,0:15:11.480
You will know that what people had said about me brought you here.

0:15:11.480,0:15:14.040
You are here to confirm.

0:15:14.040,0:15:17.820
And that confirmation will lead you to our friendship.

0:15:17.820,0:15:21.620
We will soon become friends.

0:15:21.620,0:15:23.200
Don't fight.

0:15:23.200,0:15:24.980
Take it easy.

0:15:24.980,0:15:28.060
What people say about your business,

0:15:28.060,0:15:30.340
what people say about your family,

0:15:30.340,0:15:37.000
what people say about your life out there - is for your good.

0:15:37.000,0:15:44.520
If truly you are sent by God it will turn around to favour you.
