God is still saying something.

On Sunday the 20th of April 2014 during a live Sunday Service at The SCOAN,

0:00:12.200,0:00:16.380
Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message concerning an attack

0:00:16.380,0:00:19.700
which he saw would occur in a French-speaking country.

0:00:19.700,0:00:21.700
These were his words.

0:00:21.700,0:00:24.300
In a French country, this is France,

0:00:24.300,0:00:26.780
I'm seeing an attack;

0:00:26.780,0:00:28.920
there will be an attack there.

0:00:28.920,0:00:31.540
They should take note of Wednesday and Thursday.

0:00:31.540,0:00:34.760
I will ask them to play it on Emmanuel TV.

0:00:34.760,0:00:42.960
The following week, during The SCOAN live service on Sunday the 27th of April 2014,

0:00:42.960,0:00:46.920
Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke further about the vision God had given him

0:00:46.920,0:00:49.620
concerning the French-speaking country.

0:00:49.620,0:00:53.280
He mentioned that the perpetrators were still in town

0:00:53.280,0:01:01.040
and specified the location in which he saw the attack occur - Paris, the capital city of France.

0:01:01.040,0:01:02.580
These were his words.

0:01:02.580,0:01:07.600
The nation, a French-speaking country which I said last Sunday -

0:01:07.600,0:01:12.360
these people are still in the town - French-speaking.

0:01:12.360,0:01:17.600
I was saying last week in Paris - that was the location I saw last week.

0:01:17.600,0:01:24.060
Breaking News, out of Paris, an attack at the office of a well-known French satirical magazine

0:01:24.060,0:01:26.100
has left at least 10 people dead.

0:01:26.100,0:01:30.600
We are hearing two heavily armed gun men stormed into Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris.

0:01:30.600,0:01:36.000
You may recall that office was fire bombed and severely damaged several years ago

0:01:36.000,0:01:38.840
in response to cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed.

0:01:38.840,0:01:41.500
We will go straight to CNN's Jim Bitterman in Paris.

0:01:41.500,0:01:47.620
Jim, bring us the very latest update. 10 dead, among them police officers.

0:01:47.620,0:01:51.820
That's according to the prosecutor's office; it could actually be higher than that.

0:01:51.820,0:01:53.660
We are still waiting for confirmation.

0:01:53.660,0:01:56.260
There are numbers that are being reported as high as 11

0:01:56.260,0:02:00.620
that have been killed in this attack this morning and the number of people injured.

0:02:00.620,0:02:05.760
Basically, the gun men, according to eye witnesses, went into the offices

0:02:05.760,0:02:08.220
during the editorial meeting this morning

0:02:08.220,0:02:13.740
as editors, reporters and cartoonists had gathered around and started shooting.

0:02:13.740,0:02:18.080
The attack went on for about five minutes and according to some eye witnesses,

0:02:18.080,0:02:23.380
the attackers were armed with a rocket launcher as well as some machine guns.

0:02:23.380,0:02:27.260
It looks like it was a very well prepared attack.

0:02:27.260,0:02:30.040
The men were dressed in black. The two men were dressed in black.

0:02:36.780,0:02:40.480
pursing the gun men as they were running away from the scene.

0:02:40.480,0:02:43.080
In a French country, this is France.
