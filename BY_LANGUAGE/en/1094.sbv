0:00:00.000,0:00:02.420
Brother, can I talk to you?

0:00:02.420,0:00:04.060
Where is your wife?

0:00:04.060,0:00:08.500
You have a very hot clash with your wife.

0:00:08.500,0:00:09.640
It is true, man of God.

0:00:09.640,0:00:11.200
Very, very hot clash.

0:00:11.200,0:00:12.200
It is true.

0:00:12.200,0:00:14.680
In the world, we call it abomination.

0:00:14.680,0:00:15.640
It is true.

0:00:15.640,0:00:16.600
Is this your wife?

0:00:16.600,0:00:18.640
Yes, man of God.

0:00:18.640,0:00:21.760
Prophecy Time

0:00:21.760,0:00:22.600
You are the wife.

0:00:22.600,0:00:23.620
Yes, man of God.

0:00:23.620,0:00:27.380
Why do you allow your appearance to deceive you?

0:00:27.380,0:00:32.140
When you look at the mirror, you look beautiful; you allowed that to deceive you.

0:00:32.140,0:00:35.600
You allowed your appearance to deceive you and you want to destroy your marriage.

0:00:35.600,0:00:37.220
Yes, man of God.

0:00:37.220,0:00:38.700
What you did is bad.

0:00:38.700,0:00:39.420
Yes, man of God.

0:00:39.420,0:00:41.000
I hope you have confessed to him.

0:00:41.000,0:00:42.260
Yes, man of God.

0:00:42.260,0:00:45.400
I want to be part of this family.

0:00:45.400,0:00:48.340
Listen.

0:00:48.340,0:00:52.680
It is satan that wants to destroy your home; it is not her.

0:00:52.680,0:00:54.960
You know, I was saying something -

0:00:54.960,0:01:02.800
begin to reject any torture from the enemy of your soul.

0:01:02.800,0:01:06.940
It is the enemy of our souls that tortures us with depression.

0:01:06.940,0:01:15.260
"Ah, this man is... I'm light in complexion. I'm a beautiful woman..."

0:01:15.260,0:01:16.880
This is your wife.

0:01:16.880,0:01:24.280
What happened was to destroy this marriage.

0:01:24.280,0:01:30.800
Anything close to Jesus receives attack.

0:01:30.800,0:01:36.100
Thank you, man of God.

0:01:36.100,0:01:38.660
She has confessed to you, what else again?

0:01:38.660,0:01:41.220
It is a dirty thing.

0:01:41.220,0:01:45.700
When I was there, I just saw a very hot situation in the marriage.

0:01:45.700,0:01:48.200
Don’t listen to your people; listen to God.

0:01:48.200,0:01:53.160
Don’t listen to Mr T.B. Joshua, listen to Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:53.160,0:01:57.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:57.520,0:02:00.740
You did this stupid thing on your street.

0:02:00.740,0:02:03.020
It is not a distance but on the street.

0:02:03.020,0:02:06.700
This is your wife; you cannot get any other woman.

0:02:06.700,0:02:07.960
This is your father.

0:02:07.960,0:02:11.320
If this man listens to God, he is no longer only your husband

0:02:11.320,0:02:14.440
but your father because he has discretion.

0:02:14.440,0:02:20.480
He can say, "I will not take what God says, this is shame..."

0:02:20.480,0:02:22.060
but he wants to listen to God.

0:02:22.060,0:02:22.960
Yes, man of God.

0:02:22.960,0:02:24.280
He is your father.

0:02:24.280,0:02:25.400
Yes, daddy.

TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:33.800,0:02:36.840
My name is Alex Tshiteta.

0:02:36.840,0:02:39.540
The woman beside me is my wife.

0:02:39.540,0:02:41.660
We are coming from Zambia.

0:02:41.660,0:02:48.220
Last week Sunday, the man of God located me and he prophesied into my life.

0:02:48.220,0:02:50.080
He asked me, "Where is your wife?"

0:02:50.080,0:02:56.020
I did not know where she was, so she came and the man of God said, "This is your wife".

0:02:56.020,0:02:59.340
I agreed, "Yes, she is my wife".

0:02:59.340,0:03:06.500
The man of God said, "What happened in your marriage was an attack from satan".

0:03:06.500,0:03:09.940
I agreed; it was an attack from satan.

0:03:09.940,0:03:15.560
We have not been together for 1 year and six months.

0:03:15.560,0:03:18.780
The man of God said, "This is your wife.

0:03:18.780,0:03:24.220
She has apologised for whatever she did - you have to forgive her".

0:03:24.220,0:03:27.260
The prophecy is true.

0:03:27.260,0:03:37.120
It all started way back, in 2016; we separated...

0:03:37.120,0:03:43.660
We were married when we were young, and I knew and understood her very well

0:03:43.660,0:03:50.680
I noticed that there were some things that began to change in her; the way she reacted and did her things.

0:03:50.680,0:03:55.420
I was expecting that she was seeing someone else.

0:03:55.420,0:04:00.080
Being an "IT personnel" I did not want to accuse her,

0:04:00.080,0:04:06.860
so I took it upon myself and said, "Let me find out what really is happening".

0:04:06.860,0:04:13.460
I downloaded a software on her phone that allowed me to have access

0:04:13.460,0:04:15.660
to everything happening on her phone,

0:04:15.660,0:04:22.660
whenever she was communicating, chatting - I was able to know.

0:04:22.660,0:04:27.180
As time went on, I began to realize that she was seeing someone for real.

0:04:27.180,0:04:32.440
Then I confronted her; she confirmed and said it was true.

0:04:32.440,0:04:36.900
I was furious and angry.

0:04:36.900,0:04:43.880
I decided and said, "If it is like this, you have to pack and go your way".

0:04:43.880,0:04:52.400
We separated - it is now almost 1 year and 6 months we have been apart.

0:04:52.400,0:04:58.720
Last week, when the man of God located us and prophesied into my life,

0:04:58.720,0:05:01.840
he told me it was an attack from satan.

0:05:01.840,0:05:07.600
He said that everything that is close to God receives attacks.

0:05:07.600,0:05:11.160
I began to understand that it was an attack for real.

0:05:11.160,0:05:19.220
After that we were prayed for and we were delivered and I begin to have the same affection I had,

0:05:19.220,0:05:22.940
some time ago when we were newly married.

0:05:22.940,0:05:29.660
After the deliverance and the prophecy from the man of God, my heart has been relieved;

0:05:29.660,0:05:38.240
I'm able to sit down with her and talk to her - we are now together as husband and wife.

0:05:38.240,0:05:43.660
That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put your hands together beautifully

0:05:43.660,0:05:48.680
for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has restored this marriage to the glory of God.

0:05:48.680,0:05:49.820
You have said it all.

0:05:49.820,0:05:53.620
Right now, with your experience and what really happened, we believe you are in the best position

0:05:53.620,0:05:58.200
to advise all and sundry - what word of advice do you have to render?

0:05:58.200,0:06:02.480
My advice to everyone out there is that:

0:06:02.480,0:06:11.220
when you are exhausted in this life due to circumstances or challenges,

0:06:11.220,0:06:15.080
maybe in your marriage, business, or career,

0:06:15.080,0:06:19.560
you should not give up because your emotions may lead you astray

0:06:19.560,0:06:22.660
but God will lead you on the right path.

0:06:22.660,0:06:28.660
It is better for you to really find out what God is speaking over your situation.

0:06:28.660,0:06:31.140
Amen. You have heard it all.

0:06:31.140,0:06:37.720
Indeed, it is a wonderful piece of advice and it is all in tune with the Word of God.

0:06:37.720,0:06:42.860
When we make mistakes, as we all do, we should not run from God, but rather we should run to Him,

0:06:42.860,0:06:47.540
for an instant and immediate solution to all fundamental issues of life.

0:06:47.540,0:06:50.280
Without further ado, we want to hear from your wife.

0:06:50.280,0:06:56.200
My name is Mrs Mary Tshiteta.

0:06:56.200,0:07:03.040
The problem that brought us here: we have been separated for 1 year and 6 months.

0:07:03.040,0:07:09.300
We have been going to so many places looking for a solution, but none was found.

0:07:09.300,0:07:14.540
That's how I came to The SCOAN.

0:07:14.540,0:07:18.680
Last Sunday, during the service, the man of God located my husband.

0:07:18.680,0:07:26.400
He told him that there was a hot clash and abomination that happened in our marriage.

0:07:26.400,0:07:29.000
He asked my husband, "Where is your wife?"

0:07:29.000,0:07:32.940
That was when I came out.

0:07:32.940,0:07:38.780
I confirmed the prophecy to be true, because it all started with me.

0:07:38.780,0:07:43.260
We got married at an early stage.

0:07:43.260,0:07:47.140
We have 3 kids.

0:07:47.140,0:07:50.760
The spirit in me led me to start feeling like,

0:07:50.760,0:07:56.380
"Since I got married at an early stage, I don't know what is on the other side of life.

0:07:56.380,0:08:03.360
I don't know what is on the other side of the coin; a coin has 2 sides."

0:08:03.360,0:08:06.040
I didn't feel comfortable with myself.

0:08:06.040,0:08:15.720
So, I started going out to meet another man-friend, without my husband knowing or his consent.

0:08:15.720,0:08:22.400
After my husband found out, he confronted me and I confessed everything to him.

0:08:22.400,0:08:24.740
That's how he got upset.

0:08:24.740,0:08:28.900
He said, "If it is like this, you have to go back to your parents' house".

0:08:28.900,0:08:32.260
That's how I went back to my parents.

0:08:32.260,0:08:35.940
We have been separated for 1 year and six months.

0:08:35.940,0:08:42.580
That's how we came here and the man of God prophesied to us, prayed for us,

0:08:42.580,0:08:46.340
delivered and counselled us.

0:08:46.340,0:08:51.420
After the deliverance, the affection, the love that I had for my husband,

0:08:51.420,0:08:58.540
the love that we had when we were young is back, and we are able to relate together even better.

0:08:58.540,0:09:05.540
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:09:05.540,0:09:09.080
We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your lives.

0:09:09.080,0:09:14.660
What do you have to say to your husband right now?

0:09:14.660,0:09:23.380
I would like to apologize to my husband, because I have hurt him so much.

0:09:23.380,0:09:26.580
I brought shame to him.

0:09:26.580,0:09:31.580
I was supposed to be his wife but I became his embarrassment.

0:09:31.580,0:09:39.320
I want to use this opportunity to apologize to him, to say that I am so sorry.

0:09:42.560,0:09:46.380
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:09:46.380,0:09:48.600
Only Jesus Christ can justly do this.

0:09:48.600,0:09:51.740
We thank God Almighty for this wonderful restoration.

0:09:51.740,0:09:55.380
We believe the Lord has done it, and it shall remain permanent.

0:09:55.380,0:10:00.600
Finally, what word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?

0:10:00.600,0:10:08.420
My word of advice to my fellow young ladies, women is that:

0:10:08.420,0:10:12.520
Do not be moved by what is happening in the world out there.

0:10:12.520,0:10:21.380
If you feel those emotions that lead you astray, it is better you run to God.

0:10:21.380,0:10:25.420
The Bible says he who finds a wife, finds a good thing.

0:10:25.420,0:10:32.980
So, let God lead us to be good thing, a blessing to our husbands and not a burden.

0:10:32.980,0:10:34.840
Let's run to God.

0:10:34.840,0:10:38.300
Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:10:38.300,0:10:40.720
It has been indeed a wonderful word of advice.

0:10:40.720,0:10:47.280
We thank the Lord Jesus Christ, who has used His able servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua to reconcile,

0:10:47.280,0:10:50.420
and bring this couple together once again and forever.

0:10:50.420,0:10:55.140
We pray as both of you go and make the Word of God the standard for your lives,

0:10:55.140,0:10:57.820
that this reconciliation and blessing will remain permanent.

0:10:57.820,0:11:03.940
And always have it at the back of your mind, that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.

0:11:03.940,0:11:06.800
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
