0:00:00.000,0:00:02.600
My brother, you listened to the message today?

0:00:02.600,0:00:03.280
Yes, sir.

0:00:03.280,0:00:04.780
What are you taking home?

0:00:04.780,0:00:09.900
I'm taking home the fact that I must deny myself, carry my cross and follow Jesus.

0:00:09.900,0:00:12.920
But before now, you were born again?

0:00:12.920,0:00:13.840
Yes, Man of God. Ok!

0:00:13.840,0:00:18.700
Ok. But now, you have not denied yourself, have you?

0:00:18.700,0:00:20.520
Yes.

0:00:20.520,0:00:22.080
You want to go and deny yourself now?

0:00:22.080,0:00:23.320
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:23.320,0:00:25.500
How do you deny yourself?

0:00:25.500,0:00:30.100
By giving total commitment to God, and not just lip service.

0:00:30.100,0:00:35.480
There is an injection you were taking before, that used to make you high.

0:00:35.480,0:00:40.960
I am happy you have realised that you need to deny yourself and take up your cross.

0:00:40.960,0:00:41.800
Yes, Man of God.

0:00:41.800,0:00:44.580
Not just accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.

0:00:44.580,0:00:53.680
If you say you accept Jesus genuinely, commitment would ask Jesus to accept you, to take you.

0:00:53.680,0:00:58.180
The commitment is the one that will introduce you, not the acceptance.

0:00:58.180,0:01:01.600
When you say, "I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour" truly, genuinely,

0:01:01.600,0:01:10.320
but the commitment would now be the one to introduce you, "Jesus, ok, this is a beloved one".

0:01:10.320,0:01:14.420
Your healing - because you want to live for God.

0:01:14.420,0:01:15.060
Amen.

0:01:15.060,0:01:19.240
Ok? That is why they cannot ask you, "Where is the money?

0:01:19.240,0:01:26.500
Bring money, food, bring this, bring that!" - no!

0:01:26.500,0:01:30.400
Because to live for God - that is why you are receiving this healing.

0:01:30.400,0:01:32.300
Come on!

0:01:32.300,0:01:38.060

TESTIMONY TIME

Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:14.980,0:02:18.160
Emmanuel, People of God!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:18.160,0:02:23.500
My name is Derek Miranda, I'm a Zimbabwean that's currently residing in Kenya.

0:02:23.500,0:02:31.080
The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that of difficulty in walking caused by a broken femur.

0:02:31.080,0:02:38.660
I sustained a broken femur earlier this year from an accident that occurred whilst I was running.

0:02:38.660,0:02:43.740
As a result of that accident, I was impaired; I spent a month out of work.

0:02:43.740,0:02:47.180
And the pain that followed was unbearable.

0:02:47.180,0:02:51.580
It stopped me from enjoying the simple things in life.

0:02:51.580,0:02:57.300
I could not move with freedom. I could not sit or stand for too long.

0:02:57.300,0:03:03.900
My entire existence reminded me of the fact that I had a broken leg and I was in pain.

0:03:03.900,0:03:12.900
So, it affected my work and I was highly dependent on drugs to help me cope with the pain.

0:03:12.900,0:03:19.840
That is what brought me to The SCOAN in pursuit of a solution.

0:03:19.840,0:03:28.540
So as a result of my injury, I had to use crutches to help me with my mobility if I wanted to go places.

0:03:28.540,0:03:34.820
I couldn't lift my leg, I had to drag it along; it had lost muscle strength and power.

0:03:34.820,0:03:40.980
So, I had seen multiple orthopedic surgeons in different countries such as Kenya and South Africa.

0:03:40.980,0:03:47.540
But the last orthopedic surgeon that we consulted indicated that I needed to go back into surgery.

0:03:47.540,0:03:53.800
Once I returned to my original orthopedic surgeon, he advised me that he saw nothing wrong.

0:03:53.800,0:03:57.240
So, it was a conflict in medical opinion over my situation.

0:03:57.240,0:04:03.580
Therefore, I decided that I was going to consult and seek the Word of God over my life and situation.

0:04:03.580,0:04:05.300
And that is what brought me here to The SCOAN.

0:04:05.300,0:04:09.440
When I came here, by the grace of God, the man of God located me.

0:04:09.440,0:04:15.000
When he located me, he came towards me and he started ministering towards me.

0:04:15.000,0:04:20.740
He told me that it is not the acceptance of Jesus Christ that brings Him to the scene.

0:04:20.740,0:04:25.320
It is your total commitment to Him that brings Him to the scene.

0:04:25.320,0:04:28.680
And once he did that, he also prophesied upon my life and

0:04:28.680,0:04:32.760
he indicated the fact that I had been using drugs that made me high.

0:04:32.760,0:04:37.700
I confirm this prophecy to be true at this point because I've been highly dependent on codeine

0:04:37.700,0:04:40.500
as a substance to help me cope with pain.

0:04:40.500,0:04:49.500
As soon as the man of God was done ministering to me - I donÂ´t even think he touched me,

0:04:49.500,0:04:58.620
he just stretched his hand towards me and instantly, I felt an unspeakable surge of power

0:04:58.620,0:05:01.680
go through my entire body, go through my entire being

0:05:01.680,0:05:04.060
and I do not remember what happened.

0:05:04.060,0:05:06.060
All I know is that I felt that power.

0:05:06.060,0:05:11.720
When I stood up, it was as if something had left me and I was finding myself again.

0:05:11.720,0:05:12.980
That's what happened.

0:05:12.980,0:05:16.540
Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

0:05:16.540,0:05:19.980
Healed of Difficulty in Walking Due to Fracture - No longer Using a Crutch

0:05:19.980,0:05:24.640
So, you mean, you felt that overwhelming power - the presence of God?

0:05:24.640,0:05:27.760
And when you stood up, what happened?

0:05:27.760,0:05:33.480
When I stood up, I stood up with  a renewed sense of energy.

0:05:33.480,0:05:40.220
My bones felt really strengthened to a point where I could stand on one leg which I could never do before.

0:05:40.220,0:05:43.180
Just for dressing up, I had to sit on the bed.

0:05:43.180,0:05:48.560
But now, I can actually stand on the leg that was previously injured.

0:05:48.560,0:05:53.620
So I felt a large sense of renewal within my entire being.

0:05:53.620,0:05:57.160
So, you mean now that all the things you could not do before, you can now do them?

0:05:57.160,0:05:59.540
And the pain is now a thing of the past?

0:05:59.540,0:06:03.220
Yes, pain is now a thing of the past, in Jesus' mighty name!

0:06:03.220,0:06:07.040
Amen! Put your hands together for Jesus!

0:06:07.040,0:06:09.180
Healed of Difficulty in Walking Due to Fracture in Femur - No longer Using a Crutch

0:06:09.180,0:06:14.100
Yes. To the glory of God, can you now move and let us see what the Lord has done in your life?

0:06:14.100,0:06:16.840
Healed of Difficulty in Walking Due to Fracture in Femur - No Longer Using a Crutch

0:06:16.840,0:06:19.640
Can you still feel the pain as you're moving?

0:06:19.640,0:06:22.180
There is no pain whatsoever.

0:06:22.180,0:06:23.600
To God be the glory.

0:06:23.600,0:06:28.320
Healed of Difficulty in Walking Due to Fracture in Femur - No Longer Using a Crutch

0:06:28.340,0:06:33.960
And remember, in your testimony, you said you were addicted to codeine because of this terrible pain.

0:06:33.960,0:06:38.180
So now, are you still addicted to drugs now? Are you still having that issue?

0:06:38.180,0:06:40.720
No, I have no desire to take drugs.

0:06:40.720,0:06:45.840
The enemy tried to tempt me with a headache but I couldn't even take painkillers to treat that headache.

0:06:45.840,0:06:50.840
So, I have no affinity or desire towards taking any drugs. I am pain-free and drug-free.

0:06:50.840,0:06:51.800
Wow.

0:06:51.800,0:06:55.860
Healed of Difficulty in Walking Due to Fracture in Femur - No Longer Using a Crutch

0:06:55.860,0:06:59.740
The advice that I have for them is the same advice that the Prophet gave last week:

0:06:59.740,0:07:05.160
That it is not just acceptance of Christ Jesus; it is your total commitment to Jesus Christ.

0:07:05.160,0:07:10.660
Denying yourself is what compels Jesus to approach and come on the scene.

0:07:10.660,0:07:15.080
So, be committed to God, like the man of God said. It is not only accepting Him

0:07:15.080,0:07:21.400
as your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but be totally committed to Him with your body, spirit and soul

0:07:21.400,0:07:23.700
and it shall be well with you in Jesus' name.
