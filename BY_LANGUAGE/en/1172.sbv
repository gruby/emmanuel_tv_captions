0:00:00.000,0:00:02.960
Brother, marry and remarry.

0:00:02.960,0:00:03.860
Yes, sir.

0:00:03.860,0:00:05.500
What a handsome man!

0:00:05.500,0:00:07.060
What a young man!

0:00:07.060,0:00:10.420
Why did this kind of problem start with you?

0:00:10.420,0:00:11.760
I don't know, sir.

0:00:11.765,0:00:16.480
Because I see you come from one place to another place.

0:00:16.480,0:00:17.320
Yes, sir.

0:00:17.320,0:00:20.380
Where is your wife now?

0:00:20.380,0:00:25.040
You have to pray, so that this marriage will hold. There is a man between you.

0:00:25.040,0:00:26.320
You have a spiritual husband.

0:00:26.320,0:00:27.100
Yes, it's true.

0:00:27.100,0:00:27.820
You know that.

0:00:27.820,0:00:28.320
Yes, sir.

0:00:37.440,0:00:40.300
This is your wife now, my brother.

0:00:40.300,0:00:46.520
This is your wife now. Before now you carried somebody's wife.

0:00:46.520,0:00:50.880
From one wife to another. But you - you only look for beautiful women.

0:00:50.880,0:00:51.920
Yes, sir, it's true.

0:00:51.920,0:00:53.860
Why are you looking for beautiful women?

0:00:53.860,0:00:56.600
I don't really know why.

0:01:26.140,0:01:29.980
My name is Mrs. Becky Gayzee Kamibia.

0:01:29.980,0:01:35.980
I came last year because of a spiritual husband and delay in pregnancy.

0:01:35.980,0:01:41.920
Before I came here, I knew I had a spiritual husband which had been disturbing me

0:01:41.920,0:01:44.040
even before I got married.

0:01:44.040,0:01:47.180
I knew I had it because sometimes, when I was cooking in the kitchen,

0:01:47.180,0:01:51.580
I'd normally see this man in the kitchen. He would be staring at me.

0:01:51.580,0:01:56.660
So sometimes, when we were sleeping, I noticed that there was a man between me and my husband.

0:01:56.660,0:02:00.540
I'd normally get angry and at any little thing I'd flare up.

0:02:00.540,0:02:05.520
After I got married, my menstruation ceased for four years.

0:02:05.520,0:02:10.300
During the ceased menstruation I couldn't ovulate. I didn't have menstruation.

0:02:10.300,0:02:13.060
I was looking for the fruit of the womb.

0:02:13.060,0:02:15.860
We had gone to so many places but no solution.

0:02:15.860,0:02:19.780
He said we should come to The SCOAN and that I would have my deliverance.

0:02:19.780,0:02:25.400
After the deliverance, immediately as I got home, I started seeing my menstruation that month.

0:02:25.400,0:02:31.460
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!

0:02:31.460,0:02:36.400
After I saw my menstruation, we met as husband and wife and I conceived.

0:02:36.400,0:02:38.120
When I told my husband I was pregnant,

0:02:38.120,0:02:40.960
he didn't believe it. He was in the bathroom bathing.

0:02:40.960,0:02:45.900
So I just ran the tests and I told him that I was pregnant. He almost fell out of the bath.

0:02:45.900,0:02:48.260
He screamed and said he couldn't believe it.

0:02:48.260,0:02:51.560
So before I delivered this baby,

0:02:51.560,0:02:56.440
I told him where I got my deliverance and that I want that Anointing Water,

0:02:56.440,0:03:00.880
that that is my tablet and I want to take the Anointing water with me.

0:03:00.880,0:03:05.360
The day of my labour, I took the Anointing Water and I put it in my bag.

0:03:05.360,0:03:12.160
During the process of delivering, the doctor said, "The cervix is open but the baby is not coming out".

0:03:12.160,0:03:13.540
I said, "Why?"

0:03:13.540,0:03:15.960
He said the contraction was not strong enough.

0:03:15.960,0:03:17.920
So the nurses were doing something.

0:03:17.920,0:03:20.320
I said: "What is the problem?"They didn't  want to tell me.

0:03:20.320,0:03:23.620
The other nurse told me that the contraction was not strong

0:03:23.620,0:03:26.980
and they didn't want to tell the doctor because they'd book me for an operation.

0:03:26.980,0:03:37.000
I said:  "You should have told me, I have the medicine in my bag." She said: "What medicine?"

0:03:37.000,0:03:39.260
She said:  "What medicine?" I said: "The Anointing Water".

0:03:39.260,0:03:41.040
She said:  "What is Anointing Water?"

0:03:41.040,0:03:44.280
I said: "Don't you have the channel here - Emmanuel TV?"

0:03:44.280,0:03:46.320
She said:  "What is Emmanuel TV?"

0:03:46.320,0:03:54.000
I said: "Don't worry. Let me deliver this baby first and I will explain it to you."

0:03:54.000,0:03:58.600
She now gave me my bag and I took the Anointing Water and I sprayed it in my mouth.

0:03:58.600,0:04:02.680
Immediately when I sprayed it in my mouth, my tummy started vibrating.

0:04:02.680,0:04:05.860
This woman  said: "The contraction is coming. Madam, this Anointing Water..."

0:04:05.860,0:04:09.420
I said: "Don't worry, let me deliver this baby."

0:04:09.420,0:04:12.760
Testimony Time

0:04:12.760,0:04:15.740
The doctor now came and said:  "What is the problem?"

0:04:15.740,0:04:17.340
The nurse said: "No problem."

0:04:17.340,0:04:23.960
I took some more of the Anointing Water and immediately, as I sprayed it, the baby just came out.

0:04:23.960,0:04:29.420

0:04:29.420,0:04:31.560
Yes, this is the bouncing baby girl!

0:04:31.560,0:04:34.960
Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

We give glory to God Almighty, as we know that the prophet shall say

0:04:44.060,0:04:48.300
that which he shall live to see accomplished.

0:04:48.300,0:04:52.260
When the prophet prophesied into her life that she was having a spiritual husband,

0:04:52.260,0:04:55.360
that there was a man lying between her and the husband,

0:04:55.360,0:04:58.988
immediately, as we know, prophecy brings about solution.

0:04:58.988,0:05:05.900
After the prophecy, she received deliverance and we can see the result of that deliverance

0:05:05.900,0:05:11.080
to prove that God Almighty has indeed granted her that complete deliverance.

0:05:11.080,0:05:15.380
As you know, that the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which is the Kingdom of Light,

0:05:15.380,0:05:22.580
is not something hoped for, it is a fact and when the Son of God says: "You are free!", you are free indeed.

0:05:22.580,0:05:25.360
Put your hands together once again for Jesus!

0:05:25.360,0:05:28.680

0:05:28.680,0:05:30.500
And we can see you're holding a picture.

0:05:30.500,0:05:31.140
Yes.

0:05:31.140,0:05:32.680
Can you tell us what is in the picture?

0:05:32.680,0:05:35.040
This is the picture when I was pregnant.

0:05:35.040,0:05:39.020
Hallelujah! We are seeing on the screen of our television

0:05:39.020,0:05:44.160
the picture of when she was pregnant and she has really documented her testimony,

0:05:44.160,0:05:50.360
as she knew that she was still coming back to give a testimony before the children of God.

0:05:50.360,0:05:55.840
And we give glory to God that today you a living testimony of the goodness of God in your life.

0:05:55.840,0:05:59.980
And can you tell us - what is your advice to those that are listening to you right now?

0:05:59.980,0:06:02.380
My advice is for you to have faith.

0:06:02.380,0:06:05.480
When you have faith, nothing is impossible for God to do.

0:06:05.480,0:06:10.400
Yes. With faith all things are possible.

0:06:10.400,0:06:13.900
And as you know that Jesus' power to heal and deliver and set us free

0:06:13.900,0:06:16.520
depends on our faith to receive.

0:06:16.520,0:06:20.700
So let us exercise that absolute faith and confidence in God Almighty

0:06:20.700,0:06:25.880
that whatever situation you may be in, God is working out the answer.

0:06:25.880,0:06:29.780
The name of my baby is Josephine.

0:06:29.780,0:06:35.720
Hallelujah!  Put your hands together for Jesus. We give glory to God Almighty.

0:06:35.720,0:06:41.600
We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
