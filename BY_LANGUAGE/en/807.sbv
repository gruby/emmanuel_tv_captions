The Devastation Of The School In The Indigenous Community Of San Salvador De Los Chachis

0:00:26.040,0:00:30.900
One major casualty of the earthquake was the bilingual educational complex

0:00:30.900,0:00:39.480
in the Chachi indigenous community of San Salvador located deep within the Mache-Chindul rainforest

0:00:39.480,0:00:44.980
This was the main primary and secondary school for the community and its areas,

0:00:44.980,0:00:49.820
providing education for more than 300 students.

0:00:49.820,0:00:52.360
The community was shattered by its loss.

0:00:52.360,0:00:56.300
Since the destruction of the school threatened not only the education of the children,

0:00:56.300,0:01:00.680
but also the very future of the community itself.

0:01:36.180,0:01:42.820
The essential food and hygiene items had been bought in Columbia by T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners,

0:01:42.820,0:01:46.680
specifically to meet the needs of the earthquake victims.

The cargo plane was received in Quito, Equador, and then two large trucks provided by the Armed Forces

0:02:06.820,0:02:12.420
transported the goods to the Emmanuel TV Operations Centre in the Esmeraldas Province,

0:02:12.420,0:02:15.600
close to the areas most affected by the earthquake.

The team worked with local volunteers to pack and then to personally distribute

0:02:36.440,0:02:40.720
the much needed supplies, together with fresh fruits and vegetables,

0:02:40.720,0:02:44.820

During this programme, the Governor of Esmeraldas, Paola Cabezas,

0:02:58.560,0:03:02.820
told the Emmanuel TV team about the Chachi Community of San Salvador,

0:03:02.820,0:03:09.660
who had received very little help due to their remote location within the rainforest.

0:03:09.660,0:03:18.580

0:03:18.580,0:03:21.900
The Emmanuel TV team immediately made plans to go there,

0:03:21.900,0:03:24.940
taking with them over 2 tonnes of the essential relief aid

0:03:24.940,0:03:29.080
as well as emergency water purification kits for each family.

0:03:36.300,0:03:39.540
The San Salvador community was indeed difficult to reach,

0:03:39.540,0:03:43.820
with all the relief items having to be transported by canoe.

0:03:58.260,0:04:05.820
Many of the Emmanuel TV team with local helpers, also had to walk for around two hours to reach San Salvador.

0:04:05.820,0:04:09.900
In many places the trail was very muddy.

The community all gathered together to receive the family hygiene boxes and the food aid,

0:04:56.520,0:05:01.680
encouraged and happy to know that they had not been forgotten.

0:05:01.680,0:05:07.100
During their visit, the Emmanuel TV Team saw that the children were no longer able to go to school

0:05:07.100,0:05:10.440
and arranged some games and activities for them.

Later some students, parents and teachers from the school explained more.

Jose Gabriel Tapuya de la Cruz - Student from 'Juan Lorenzo Anapa' School

0:05:49.100,0:05:54.600
I am in the 9th grade and I am 19 years old.

0:05:54.600,0:06:03.600
The school collapsed due to the earthquake on the 16th of April, 2016

0:06:03.600,0:06:09.780
As students, we were not able to continue studying because it was very dangerous.

0:06:09.780,0:06:14.120
Luis San Nicolas - Teacher from 'Juan Lorenzo Anapa' School

0:06:14.120,0:06:21.520
Currently, I am working in this school as a teacher of History and Geography.

0:06:21.520,0:06:29.840
We never expected such a natural disaster but unfortunately, everything has been destroyed.

0:06:29.840,0:06:40.480
So, as teachers, we have built temporary classrooms to be able to continue teaching.

0:06:40.480,0:06:54.120
We did this because the Ministry of Education made a law that the teaching should continue.

Karely Chasim - 16 years old / 11th Grade

0:07:02.260,0:07:04.980
I want to be a lawyer.

0:07:04.980,0:07:08.240
To come to school, we have to walk about one hour and a half.

0:07:08.240,0:07:12.020
Sometimes, when it rains, it is more difficult because of the mud.

0:07:12.020,0:07:17.860
Arriving in a school that is not in proper conditions to study is also very disappointing.

0:07:17.860,0:07:22.640
Moreover, we are worried about our uniforms getting wet or dirty.

0:07:22.640,0:07:27.840
My name is Adriana Andreína de la Cruz. I live in this community, San Salvador de Los Chachis.

0:07:27.840,0:07:30.940
I have three children - two boys and one girl.

0:07:30.940,0:07:34.720
One of them is in year 2 and the other one in year 1 of primary school.

0:07:34.720,0:07:39.420
When the earthquake happened, the classrooms collapsed and the walls fell down;

0:07:39.420,0:07:45.620
now our children don't have anywhere to study. These are not proper conditions for them to study.

0:07:45.620,0:07:51.700
When it rains, the temporary classrooms get flooded and the children are not fine there.

0:07:51.700,0:07:58.760
As a mother, I am very concerned because I want my children to study in a proper school.

Agustín Anapa Tapuyo - Director of 'Juan Lorenzo Anapa' School

0:08:07.600,0:08:13.220
This institution has about 310 students.

0:08:13.220,0:08:29.260
Right now, we are in crisis due to the earthquake which has severely damaged the school building.

0:08:29.260,0:08:35.000
This school is very important because everything depends on education.

0:08:35.000,0:08:42.780
Both children and the youth can make it in life with education.

0:08:42.780,0:08:49.860
Education forms them every day; as their character is formed, they serve their nation.

0:08:49.860,0:08:51.140
The Emmanuel TV Team Invite An Architect To Survey The Damage Done To The School

0:08:51.140,0:08:56.680
Moved by this tragedy, Emmanuel TV quickly arranged for a top Equadorian architect

0:08:56.680,0:09:02.180
to visit the site, where he observed the damage and the poor quality of construction.

for a much improved replacement school.

0:09:23.940,0:09:27.020
For the community leaders, this was a dream come true.

0:09:27.020,0:09:31.300
They expressed their thanks and commitment to help the project succeed.

0:09:31.300,0:09:38.200
The project is for a school of approximately 300 children, distributed as follows:

0:09:38.200,0:09:49.280
50 children in kindergarten, 200 in primary school and 50 in secondary school.

0:09:49.280,0:09:56.000
To fulfill these needs, we are proposing building 14 classrooms:

0:09:56.000,0:10:04.120
2 for kindergarten, 10 for primary and 2 for secondary education.

0:10:04.120,0:10:12.140
Moreover, we propose a computer room and science laboratories for Physics and Chemistry.

0:10:12.140,0:10:23.760
We are also planning to build a library, administrative office and staff room for teachers.

0:10:23.760,0:10:27.900
T.B. Joshua joined with the Emmanuel TV Partners and wasted no time

0:10:27.900,0:10:32.660
in agreeing to pay for this major construction project.

0:10:32.660,0:10:35.840
On hearing of the Emmanuel TV plan to rebuild the school,

0:10:35.840,0:10:41.120
one of the men from the village also spoke on behalf of the community.

0:10:41.120,0:10:47.040
Santiago De La Cruz Anapa - Representative Of The Chachi Community

0:10:47.040,0:10:56.340
I am joined by the Governor, School Director and other elders of The Chachi Community

0:10:56.340,0:11:06.200
The entire community is very happy to see that a dream is about to become reality.

0:11:06.200,0:11:12.500
This dream of having in the community an educational institution in line with

0:11:12.500,0:11:17.400
the development of the modernisation of education and society in the world today.

0:11:17.400,0:11:25.800
To guarantee the execution of this proposal, the entire community through an assembly

0:11:25.800,0:11:37.080
resolved to undertake this serious commitment to collaborate with the Emmanuel TV Team

0:11:37.080,0:11:41.920
with the transportation of materials in canoes, on donkeys and horses and with the labour

0:11:41.920,0:11:45.820
necessary for the project according to our possibilities.

0:11:45.820,0:11:49.460
We are sure that thanks to you, T.B. Joshua,

0:11:49.460,0:11:55.880
our children, grandchildren, brethren and the coming generations will receive

0:11:55.880,0:12:03.120
education in suitable classrooms, with space for research

0:12:03.120,0:12:06.780
to strengthen the educational process.

0:12:06.780,0:12:08.460
The community of San Salvador De Los Chachis

0:12:08.460,0:12:13.440
is located in the heart of the ecological reserve Mache-Chindul.

0:12:13.440,0:12:18.840
However, this doesn't signify that we don't have the right to receive quality education

0:12:18.840,0:12:22.800
in the infrastructure like the one you (T.B. Joshua) will provide for us.

0:12:28.480,0:12:37.700
For the first time in our history, this project is something that has fallen from Heaven to earth.

0:12:37.700,0:12:45.420
All our community members are going to work in this project.

0:12:45.420,0:12:51.960
Don't expect that only the architect and the Emmanuel TV Team will do the work.

0:12:51.960,0:12:57.780
The Chachi community is also going to collaborate with

0:12:57.780,0:13:05.640
both the transportation of the materials and coming together to build all the classrooms.

0:13:05.640,0:13:09.760
T.B. Joshua, thank you very much!

0:13:09.760,0:13:17.520
For us, it is so exciting to have a new school building

0:13:17.520,0:13:22.400
because before, we didn't have a school of such quality,

0:13:22.400,0:13:31.420
and if Emmanuel TV is giving us the opportunity to have it, we are ready to receive it.

0:13:31.420,0:13:39.900
Thank you very much to the organisation, Emmanuel TV.

0:13:39.900,0:13:47.880
I am very grateful and thank Emmanuel TV because you are doing us a great favour.

0:13:47.880,0:13:58.880
This year, I finished my secondary education, and I want my children to finish as well,

0:13:58.880,0:14:04.580
so they can make it in life and I will continue motivating them.

0:14:04.580,0:14:12.540
With this new school, we will not have headaches due to the heat; if it rains, we will not get wet

0:14:12.540,0:14:20.960
so we will be able to learn better. Thank you, Emmanuel TV!

0:14:20.960,0:14:28.020
I appreciate you so much with all my heart. Thank you for what you are doing.

0:14:28.020,0:14:35.240
I am very happy and joyful to receive this great gift from you.

Although the land for the school belongs to the Chachi community,

0:14:40.400,0:14:42.840
the school itself is a government school

0:14:42.840,0:14:47.480
and the Emmanuel TV team had important discussions with politicians and officials

0:14:47.480,0:14:50.080

I would like to thank you for your cooperation.

0:15:57.700,0:16:01.120
We really need your help and we appreciate it.

0:16:01.120,0:16:06.680
We are coordinating all through the official channels of the government.

0:16:06.680,0:16:11.780
We greatly appreciate your contribution to the school

0:16:11.780,0:16:18.540
because we are very concious of the needs of this commuinity.

0:16:53.340,0:16:56.820
preparing the way for the construction work to begin.

0:17:13.480,0:17:19.460
Education is the means of empowering people to take control of their own lives,

0:17:19.460,0:17:24.840
as learning how to learn is one of life's most important skills.

0:17:24.840,0:17:28.440
Education is to give us success.

0:17:28.440,0:17:35.160
It is a rare privilege to send someone to school; to contribute to someone's future.

0:17:35.160,0:17:43.140
And Emmanuel TV has the privilege of contributing to the future of generations from the Chachi community

0:17:43.140,0:17:47.840
and other farming settlements along the river.

0:17:47.840,0:17:54.580
Today, the first materials will be going up the river, ready to start the construction.

These are all the materials that will be transported to San Salvador by canoe.

0:18:17.600,0:18:24.280
This is the gasoline for the boats and this is the food for the workers.

0:18:24.280,0:18:38.260
This is the sand in bags and these are the rocks that we are carrying to San Salvador.

0:18:38.260,0:18:43.280
I give thanks to Emmanuel TV for supporting our community

0:18:43.280,0:18:51.560
and for giving us this opportunity that we never had before. Thank you very much!

The Emmanuel TV Team Take the Materials By Canoe To San Salvador De Los Chachis

0:19:05.900,0:19:11.280
It soon became clear that the large amounts of material needed to be transported more quickly

0:19:11.280,0:19:18.080
for the start of the construction and so a huge truck delivered stones to be transferred to smaller trucks,

0:19:18.080,0:19:22.700
which were trying to cross the river to get closer to San Salvador.

The river crossing proved to be a challenge but with extra muscle power being provided

0:20:01.600,0:20:05.120
by the local community, the truck finally made it.

The Construction Materials Are Transported By Truck To The Community Over Rough Terrain

0:20:43.560,0:20:48.840
Then there was a major breakthrough: Because of the commitment of Emmanuel TV to the school project,

0:20:48.840,0:20:53.940
the government provided heavy machinery to clear the track all the way to San Salvador.

0:20:53.940,0:20:57.040
This meant that on the few days that were dry enough,

0:20:57.040,0:21:02.440
the vehicles carrying the materials for the school construction could drive all the way.
