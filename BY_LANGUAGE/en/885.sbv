Now, you have been bound with Christ’s Spirit; your spirit has been bound with Christ’s Spirit.

0:02:08.260,0:02:10.700
I mean, you have been anchored.

0:02:10.700,0:02:17.940

0:02:37.820,0:02:40.580
I said, "Begin to shine!"

0:02:40.580,0:02:46.720
I cannot hear you, "Begin to shine!"

0:02:46.720,0:02:50.560
We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again.

0:02:50.560,0:02:54.680
Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God as you send your testimony.

0:02:54.680,0:02:57.260
Engage with God.
