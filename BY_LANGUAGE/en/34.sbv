GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING

0:00:04.720,0:00:10.800
On Sunday, July 6, 1997 Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke forth a prophetic message,

0:00:10.800,0:00:14.700
stating that a star, a popular person, would die.

0:00:14.700,0:00:16.900
These were his words.

0:00:16.900,0:00:19.580
Amen!

0:00:19.580,0:00:21.940
A star will fall.

0:00:21.940,0:00:24.280
By next Sunday, I will tell you the length of days.

0:00:24.280,0:00:26.500
Let us keep our fingers crossed.

0:00:26.500,0:00:29.300
One popular person will die.

0:00:29.300,0:00:31.420
There is nothing we can do about it.

0:00:31.420,0:00:35.380
I know that star. I know what will happen, and I know the day and time it will happen.

0:00:35.380,0:00:42.600
On Sunday, July 13, 1997 Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke further on this prophetic message,

0:00:42.600,0:00:48.520
stating that the popular person was a woman and that she would pass away in an overseas country.

0:00:48.520,0:00:50.640
These were his words.

0:00:50.640,0:00:55.680
A popular person, a woman, will pass away in an overseas country.

0:00:55.680,0:00:58.880
I know where and I know the person.

0:00:58.880,0:01:03.320
People will condemn her because of what led to her death.

0:01:03.320,0:01:05.180
People will not like to hear it.

0:01:05.180,0:01:11.980
On Sunday, July 27, 1997 Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke a final time

0:01:11.980,0:01:15.820
regarding the popular woman who would die in an overseas country.

0:01:15.820,0:01:18.540
He then specifically stated her name.

0:01:18.540,0:01:21.060
These were his words.

0:01:21.060,0:01:25.900
Three weeks ago - I want to remind you. This is an international issue.

0:01:25.900,0:01:31.660
Many of us were here when I asked people to pray - that, a star will fall,

0:01:31.660,0:01:35.920
a great star that will shake the whole world.

0:01:35.920,0:01:38.400
And it will come to pass.

0:01:38.400,0:01:40.900
And I told you she's a very young person.

0:01:40.900,0:01:43.040
The whole world will shake.

0:01:43.040,0:01:46.720
Is it Diana?

0:01:46.720,0:01:49.400
I will be here with you people. You will learn of what happened.

0:01:49.400,0:01:54.260
It's a disaster. It is not something that --

0:01:54.260,0:02:02.280
In the early hours of the morning, Sunday, August 31, 1997, news broke out around the world

0:02:02.280,0:02:06.380
that Diana, Princess of Wales, had just died.

0:02:40.580,0:02:43.900
Diana, Princess of Wales, has been seriously injured.

0:02:43.900,0:02:45.540
They had been enjoying dinner at the Ritz hotel.

0:02:45.540,0:02:49.300
Diana, the Princess of Wales, has, in fact, been killed.

0:02:49.300,0:02:51.700
Diana, Princess of Wales, has died.

0:02:51.700,0:02:55.060
The world has lost Princess Diana, age 36.

36-year-old Princess Diana and 42-year-old Dodi Al-Fayed, along with their driver,

0:03:10.200,0:03:14.100
were killed in the early morning hours in Paris

0:03:14.100,0:03:20.580
after apparently being chased at high speed by photographers on motorcycles.

0:03:20.580,0:03:26.040
Princess Diana was taken to a hospital where doctors tried to save her life.

0:03:26.040,0:03:28.140
They were unable to do that.

0:03:28.140,0:03:32.640
She died just about 1 1/2 hours ago.

0:03:32.640,0:03:36.480
It was announced that she died 2 hours earlier than that.

0:03:36.480,0:03:43.680
Apparently word was held as the sad news was passed on to (the family).

0:03:43.680,0:03:50.440
Prince Charles was staying with Prince William, the heir to the throne, and Prince Harry.

0:03:50.440,0:03:52.160
He is only 12 years old.

0:03:52.160,0:03:55.280
Prince William being 14 years of age.

0:03:55.280,0:03:58.060
This is the car in which they were riding.

0:03:58.060,0:04:00.820
It is a Mercedes Benz; it was a large vehicle.

0:04:00.820,0:04:11.300
It hit a concrete pillar at top speed at the Alma Bridge in Paris, along the Seine river.

0:04:11.300,0:04:15.380
It became clear that Princess Diana and Prince Charles were growing apart.

0:04:15.380,0:04:18.800
The newspapers would measure the days they spent separated.

0:04:18.800,0:04:23.320
A book "Diana: A True Story" by Andrew Morton revealed details of her unhappiness.

0:04:23.320,0:04:28.460
She had developed eating disorders and was even reported to have attempted suicide.

0:04:28.460,0:04:32.880
Eventually but out of the blue, the then-British Prime Minister John Major announced

0:04:32.880,0:04:35.160
that Diana and Charles would separate.

0:04:35.160,0:04:41.940
The British monarchy had not faced such a crisis since the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936.

0:04:41.940,0:04:46.320
But the Princess was not to be deterred from maintaining her high public profile.

0:04:46.320,0:04:50.760
Once the couple's divorce was confirmed and freed from the shackles of royal protocol,

0:04:50.760,0:04:54.140
she began to be seen in public with other men.

0:04:54.140,0:04:56.840
She focused her official life on several charities -

0:04:56.840,0:05:01.640
as varied as the Royal Ballet in London and the Red Cross campaign against landmines.

0:05:01.640,0:05:04.580
Within the past few months, she had been in Angola and Bosnia

0:05:04.580,0:05:07.020
to see at first hand the effect of landmines

0:05:07.020,0:05:09.380
as a guest of the International Red Cross -

0:05:09.380,0:05:12.380
a stand that caused political controversy.

0:05:12.380,0:05:16.800
She managed to combine her charitable work with a high-profile social calendar.

0:05:16.800,0:05:19.020
But it was her liason with Dodi Al-Fayed

0:05:19.020,0:05:25.660
that had seemed to be the most serious since the breakup of her marriage.
