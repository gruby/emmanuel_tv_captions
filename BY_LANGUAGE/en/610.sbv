Good morning, Church!

0:00:06.160,0:00:07.580
[Good morning.]

0:00:07.580,0:00:09.980
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:09.980,0:00:10.940
Hallelujah.

0:00:10.940,0:00:12.320
[Amen.]

The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:18.000,0:00:38.060
Viewers, we recognise you; wherever you are, whatever position you are in, Jesus knows better.

0:00:38.060,0:00:38.840
Amen.

0:00:38.840,0:00:39.960
[Amen.]

0:00:39.960,0:00:42.480
Hallelujah.

0:00:42.480,0:00:49.780
Today we will look at some challenges that relationships face.

0:00:49.780,0:01:02.280
The book of Romans 12:1-2, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy,

0:01:02.280,0:01:12.620
to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God -

0:01:12.620,0:01:17.140
this is your true and proper worship.

0:01:17.140,0:01:29.960
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

0:01:29.960,0:01:42.500
Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - His good, pleasing and perfect will."

0:01:42.500,0:01:45.260
Let me take you to the verse 19 there.

0:01:45.260,0:01:54.900
Romans 12:19-20, "Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath,

0:01:54.900,0:02:04.480
for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay, 'says the Lord.

0:02:04.480,0:02:14.760
On the contrary: 'If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.

0:02:14.760,0:02:24.040
In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.'"

0:02:24.040,0:02:27.980
I will take the last verse now - verse 21 says:

0:02:27.980,0:02:36.100
"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" - Romans 12:21.

0:02:36.100,0:02:40.840
When you look at the book of Proverbs 10:12:

0:02:40.840,0:02:51.100
"Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers all wrongs."

0:02:51.100,0:03:00.500
Countless Christians are imprisoned by offences.

0:03:00.500,0:03:03.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:03.720,0:03:14.640
Because of wounds and hurts which offences have caused in our lives,

0:03:14.640,0:03:22.800
most of us cannot function properly in our profession.

0:03:22.800,0:03:25.420
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:03:25.420,0:03:39.500
You can do better than now, but because of offences you find that you cannot function properly

0:03:39.500,0:03:45.320
in your profession; I mean, in your working place.

0:03:45.320,0:03:47.520
You cannot function properly.

0:03:47.520,0:03:54.540
Wherever you look: offences.

0:03:54.540,0:03:59.840
Offence has become an epidemic, everywhere.

0:03:59.840,0:04:09.200
Suddenly, your boss at your working place says, "OK, I demote you".

0:04:09.200,0:04:12.640
What have I done?

0:04:12.640,0:04:24.560
Suddenly, you see your inferior being asked to supervise you.

0:04:24.560,0:04:29.220
Someone whom you were sending on errands in your working place, your junior,

0:04:29.220,0:04:35.580
someone you trained over time to become what he is.

0:04:35.580,0:04:49.560
Now, your boss gives instruction that this someone will supervise you and you are to submit to him.

0:04:49.560,0:04:52.840
How would you take that?

0:04:52.840,0:05:01.300
Someone, whom you have trained over time in your working place, will become your supervisor

0:05:01.300,0:05:08.120
because he is related to the owner of the company.

0:05:08.120,0:05:15.820
Suddenly, instruction will just come for him to become your supervisor and you are to submit to him.

0:05:15.820,0:05:19.880
This person will suddenly change his tactic and strategy.

0:05:19.880,0:05:28.640
Before, he was submissive to you, but after becoming your boss, he would avoid you.

0:05:28.640,0:05:33.980
He will be sending instructions to you through someone.

0:05:33.980,0:05:38.260
How would you take it?

0:05:38.260,0:05:47.220
At the conference you will find him sitting in front of you, in the position of boss, giving instructions.

0:05:47.220,0:05:48.880
You know how they look like,

0:05:48.880,0:05:58.820
"Yes, this is very important. We should carry out this instruction..."

0:05:58.820,0:06:02.600
You know - there are "dark shades" nowadays.

0:06:02.600,0:06:04.300
Do you know "dark shades"?

0:06:04.300,0:06:11.900
OK, when you don't want to see someone around you, you put on "dark shades".

0:06:11.900,0:06:15.860
He will now begin to say, "Yes, we have to take the instruction.

0:06:15.860,0:06:26.560
The head of marketing (he is referring to you) should immediately tomorrow make sure

0:06:26.560,0:06:33.680
that this department is being supervised, and he should submit the form and report to me the next day.

0:06:33.680,0:06:36.480
Thank you. This is just an instruction I wanted to give you".

0:06:36.480,0:06:37.260
He will stand up.

0:06:37.260,0:06:40.440
But if the boss has not gone, you cannot stand up.

0:06:40.440,0:06:44.040
You cannot leave or stand up at the same time as your boss.

0:06:44.040,0:06:46.360
He has to leave.

0:06:46.360,0:06:55.440
Because of wounds and hurts which offences have caused in our lives,

0:06:55.440,0:07:04.120
most of us cannot function properly in our profession.

0:07:04.120,0:07:08.180
Each time you carry out an assignment, you will remember someone you trained.

0:07:08.180,0:07:15.080
You will not want to give your best, and your best is needed.

0:07:15.080,0:07:16.860
You begin to think.

0:07:16.860,0:07:21.380
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:21.380,0:07:35.640
We cannot function properly because we are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.

0:07:35.640,0:07:36.920
Tell your neighbour:

0:07:36.920,0:08:02.280
We cannot function properly because we are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.

0:08:02.280,0:08:05.600
It is difficult.

0:08:05.600,0:08:18.940
We carry anger, hatred, bitterness, and hurt against someone.

0:08:18.940,0:08:26.580
You believe you can function properly when you are carrying anger and hatred.

0:08:26.580,0:08:30.500
That is self-imprisonment.

0:08:30.500,0:08:32.620
Self what?

0:08:32.620,0:08:35.180
Self-imprisonment.

0:08:35.180,0:08:40.260
It is not that we are asked to go to prison, but many of us are in prison.

0:08:40.260,0:08:44.780
And it is a most serious prison.

0:08:44.780,0:08:49.180
When we talk of prison, we only think about those who are inside the physical prison.

0:08:49.180,0:08:52.780
There are countless people...

0:08:52.780,0:08:57.620
90% of the whole world are in what?

0:08:57.620,0:08:58.820
[In prison]

0:08:58.820,0:09:04.780
Self-imprisonment.

0:09:04.780,0:09:11.040
Many are victims of self-imprisonment.

0:09:11.040,0:09:23.940
You are imprisoned by anger, hatred, bitterness, hurt and unforgiveness.

0:09:23.940,0:09:38.740
Offence imprisons countless Christians, severs relationships

0:09:38.740,0:09:50.220
and widens the existing breaches between us.

0:09:50.220,0:09:57.160
Unless we release ourselves, God will not hear us.

0:09:57.160,0:10:15.060
We are hindered and handicapped from fulfilling our full potential.

0:10:15.060,0:10:36.520
To hold an offence against someone hinders and handicaps us from fulfilling our full potential.

0:10:36.520,0:10:55.240
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence, as a Christian.

0:10:55.240,0:11:14.960
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence against someone.

0:11:14.960,0:11:19.040
Listen to our Lord's prayer - we don't take it seriously.

0:11:19.040,0:11:21.080
It is fundamental.

0:11:21.080,0:11:29.300
When you wake up in the morning to walk with Jesus - this is fundamental.

0:11:29.300,0:11:31.000
Remember the Lord's prayer.

0:11:31.000,0:11:35.780
He said, "Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us".

0:11:35.780,0:11:41.480
Have you? Do you forgive?

0:11:41.480,0:11:47.900
"Daily bread" means each day has its own grace.

0:11:47.900,0:11:56.560
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence against someone.

0:11:56.560,0:12:09.060
Some of our offences emanate from our close and dearest ones.

0:12:09.060,0:12:19.380
The higher the expectation, the greater the fall.

0:12:19.380,0:12:31.520
Tell your neighbour, "The higher the expectation, the greater the fall".

0:12:31.520,0:12:48.500
Some of our offences emanate from our close and dear ones such as father, mother, wife, husband or children.

0:12:48.500,0:12:54.680
The book of Psalm 55 - I will take my reading from verse 12,

0:12:54.680,0:13:02.320
"If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it".

0:13:02.320,0:13:04.720
I like that.

0:13:04.720,0:13:15.700
"But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend." – Psalm 55:13

0:13:15.700,0:13:16.800
Did you listen to that?

0:13:16.800,0:13:29.940
Some of our offences emanate from our close and dearest ones.

0:13:29.940,0:13:42.140
If my enemy had offended me, I would not have bothered

0:13:42.140,0:14:01.740
but for you, my close friend, a man of my equal, my companion, my acquaintance.

0:14:01.740,0:14:18.800
Our families and our homes, which are meant to be a source of inspiration,

0:14:18.800,0:14:35.320
protection, provision and growth, where we learn to give love and receive love,

0:14:35.320,0:14:41.980
are often the very root of our pain -

0:14:41.980,0:14:53.460
brother against brother, father against brother, son against father and mother against son.

0:14:53.460,0:15:10.780
Battlefield of fight – family, home, a fellow Christian brother, a close friend, companion.

0:15:10.780,0:15:16.720
Rise up, and let us pray.

0:15:16.720,0:15:27.660
You want to release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you.

0:15:27.660,0:15:35.120
Release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you.

0:15:35.120,0:15:51.040
Begin to release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you and promise that you will do restitution.

0:15:51.040,0:15:54.300
Prayer.

0:15:54.300,0:16:15.580
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:16:15.580,0:16:21.000
Right now, begin to release yourself.

0:16:21.000,0:16:30.840
Promise you will do restitution.

0:16:30.840,0:16:40.220
Open your lips, viewers all over the world.

0:16:40.220,0:16:48.560
Those who have wronged you in one form or another.

0:16:48.560,0:17:04.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:04.140,0:17:12.020
Viewers all over the world, I release you, in the name of Jesus from the pain of the past!

0:17:12.020,0:17:18.620
I release you from deep hurt – be released!

0:17:18.620,0:17:23.940
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:23.940,0:17:26.300
Viewers, once again, listen:

0:17:26.300,0:17:33.100
I release you, in the name of Jesus from the pain of the past!

0:17:33.100,0:17:36.200
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:36.200,0:17:44.860
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold onto an offence.

0:17:44.860,0:17:47.660
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:47.660,0:17:58.980
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:58.980,0:18:00.520
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:18:00.520,0:18:14.320
Countless people, I mean, countless Christians are imprisoned by offence.

0:18:14.320,0:18:23.040
It is a trap; it is an effective instrument used by satan.

0:18:23.040,0:18:25.500
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:18:25.500,0:18:32.100
If you are a victim, I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:18:32.100,0:18:37.340
Be released!

0:18:37.340,0:18:38.460
Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

0:18:38.460,0:18:46.120
Release yourself – this is the key.

0:18:46.120,0:19:00.520
Release yourself; whether you are wrong or right, you have no right to hold onto an offence.

0:19:00.520,0:19:19.500
Right now, release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you in one form or another.

0:19:19.500,0:19:26.140
You have been imprisoning yourself for so long.

0:19:26.140,0:19:36.140
You have been imprisoning yourself – blessing has been looking for you but you are in the prison.

0:19:36.140,0:19:42.160
Victory has been looking for you for so long but you are in the prison.

0:19:42.160,0:19:47.020
Deliverance has been looking for you but you are in the prison.

0:19:47.020,0:19:54.480
Healing has been looking for you for so long but you are in the prison.

0:19:54.480,0:20:05.200
Promotion you are looking for has been looking for you for so long whereas you are in the prison.

0:20:05.200,0:20:15.040
Self-imprisonment -

0:20:15.040,0:20:19.180
you create that; you put yourself in the prison.

0:20:19.180,0:20:23.560
You say, "I'm right. They abuse me. They misjudge me."

0:20:23.560,0:20:34.540
Healing you are looking for has been looking for you for so long now, whereas you are in the prison.

0:20:34.540,0:20:36.280
You have to release yourself.

0:20:36.280,0:20:44.480
When you release yourself - that is the key - then they will find you.

0:20:44.480,0:20:55.160
Offence imprisons countless Christians, severs relationships

0:20:55.160,0:21:06.300
and widens the existing breaches between us.

0:21:06.300,0:21:11.200
There is trouble already, before that offence comes.

0:21:11.200,0:21:15.540
When the offence now comes...

0:21:15.540,0:21:23.060
Our Lord's prayer - "Forgive us" - this is what you ask God for, but He gives us a condition;

0:21:23.060,0:21:26.160
"I will forgive you only if you can forgive others".

0:21:26.160,0:21:27.940
That is the condition He gave you.

0:21:27.940,0:21:36.580
The condition is: "I will forgive you as far as you are ready to forgive others".

0:21:36.580,0:21:39.540
Those who wronged you - whether you are wrong or right...

0:21:39.540,0:21:44.420
Tell your neighbour, "You have been imprisoning yourself for so long".

0:21:44.420,0:21:46.960
Tell your neighbour.

0:21:46.960,0:22:00.360
Say, "I have been imprisoning myself for so long".

0:22:00.360,0:22:08.420
God says, "I will not do for you what you can do yourself".

0:22:08.420,0:22:09.880
You say, "It is difficult for me".

0:22:09.880,0:22:13.540
No. You have to.

0:22:13.540,0:22:20.480
He will not do for you what you can do yourself.

0:22:20.480,0:22:30.100
When you release yourself, healing, deliverance and protection will find you.

0:22:30.100,0:22:31.120
Just name it.

0:22:31.120,0:22:35.060
That is my secret.

0:22:35.060,0:22:43.420
That is the secret to move forward now because you have imprisoned yourself.

0:22:43.420,0:22:46.840
You made a promise you failed to fulfill.

0:22:46.840,0:22:57.980
We made a vow we failed to fulfill – "Forgive me, Lord, as I forgive those who sin against me."

0:22:57.980,0:23:06.120
When you are not forgiving others, what you are asking Him, He will not give.

0:23:06.120,0:23:09.180
I want everyone to open his mouth and say,

0:23:09.180,0:23:18.340
"Forgive me as I forgive those who sin against me".

0:23:18.340,0:23:20.180
Did you?

0:23:20.180,0:23:22.060
You know the meaning of covenant.

0:23:22.060,0:23:29.180
People pay with their blood when they break a covenant in this world.

0:23:29.180,0:23:38.000

The word testament.

0:25:03.580,0:25:09.800
You are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.

0:25:09.800,0:25:11.320
Tell your neighbour.

0:25:11.320,0:25:21.040
Say, "I am holding someone hostage of unforgiveness".

0:25:21.040,0:25:21.940
Tell yourself.

0:25:21.940,0:25:26.400
[I am holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.]

0:25:26.400,0:25:27.660
I cannot hear you.

0:25:27.660,0:25:30.980
[I am holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.]

0:25:30.980,0:25:32.720
Viewers, listen to me.

0:25:32.720,0:25:39.420
You are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.

0:25:39.420,0:25:41.020
What do I mean, viewers?

0:25:41.020,0:25:54.960
I mean, you carry anger, hurt, bitterness, envy and jealousy against someone.

0:25:54.960,0:26:14.900
To hold an offence against someone hinders and handicaps us from fulfilling our full potential.

0:26:14.900,0:26:23.960
You see that there is a restriction; the key is to release yourself.

0:26:23.960,0:26:28.120
To release yourself is your role.

0:26:28.120,0:26:36.960
Be released, in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past!

0:26:36.960,0:26:42.340
Whether you are right or wrong – be released!

0:26:42.340,0:26:48.460
Hurt, deep hurt – be released!

0:26:48.460,0:26:56.520
Whether you are right or wrong – be released!

0:26:56.520,0:27:04.280
Be released!

0:27:04.280,0:27:13.220
Be released!

0:27:13.220,0:27:24.000
Viewers all over the world, I release you in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past, from hurt, deep hurt -

0:27:24.000,0:27:27.600
be released!

0:27:27.600,0:27:32.840
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:27:32.840,0:27:43.020
Viewers, once again, listen – I release you, in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past, from hurt -

0:27:43.020,0:27:48.540
I mean, deep hurt - be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:27:48.540,0:27:57.340
Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold onto an offence.

0:27:57.340,0:28:00.160
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:28:00.160,0:28:12.960
Be released, in the name of Jesus!

0:28:12.960,0:28:27.060
Countless people – I mean, countless Christians are imprisoned by offence.

0:28:27.060,0:28:37.240
It's a trap; it's an effective instrument used by satan.

0:28:37.240,0:28:41.900
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:28:41.900,0:28:48.540
If you are a victim,
I release you, in the name of Jesus!

0:28:48.540,0:28:53.760
Be released!

0:28:53.760,0:28:57.680
In the name of Jesus!

0:29:06.400,0:29:10.520
It's not too late; God's time is the best.

0:29:10.520,0:29:11.980
Now, you are released.

0:29:11.980,0:29:13.300
[Amen!]

0:29:13.300,0:29:15.460
Say, "I'm released!"

0:29:15.460,0:29:20.360
Begin to rejoice in your release!

0:29:20.360,0:29:26.620
Rejoice.

0:29:30.920,0:29:34.280
I'm guilty of hatred and unforgiveness.

0:29:34.280,0:29:39.900
I'm holding many people hostage but I never knew because when some certain things happened to me,

0:29:39.900,0:29:49.420
instead of me to let go of that particular thing, I would just continue to hold onto that.

0:29:49.420,0:29:53.260
I never knew it would be like this; I don’t understand.

0:29:53.260,0:29:55.400
I think the problem is from upbringing.

0:29:55.400,0:29:57.060
Did you listen to that?

0:29:57.060,0:29:59.080
He knows the value of what we are talking about.

0:29:59.080,0:30:01.200
He knows where he is supposed to have been.

0:30:01.200,0:30:03.620
Many of us don't understand what we are talking about.

0:30:03.620,0:30:09.940
When you know where you are supposed to be and you are not there, it's very painful.

0:30:09.940,0:30:11.640
Look at me.

0:30:11.640,0:30:22.760
I - T.B. Joshua - revelation concerning my future has kept on coming to me for the last 35 years.

0:30:22.760,0:30:26.880
Imagine I am not where God wants me to be today.

0:30:26.880,0:30:29.280
I don't know what would have happened to me.

0:30:29.280,0:30:31.940
It is because we don't have revelation about ourselves.

0:30:31.940,0:30:34.580
You don't know what God has in store for you.

0:30:34.580,0:30:40.240
If you have been dreaming, seeing where God is taking you to and you are not there,

0:30:40.240,0:30:44.140
and you know this is where you are supposed to be but you are not there,

0:30:44.140,0:30:46.840
you will take the issue seriously.

0:30:46.840,0:30:48.720
Have you released yourself now?

0:30:48.720,0:30:49.900
Yes, man of God.

0:30:49.900,0:30:50.940
You have released yourself.

0:30:50.940,0:30:52.380
Yes.

0:30:52.380,0:30:53.920
Let's carry on.

0:30:53.920,0:31:02.840
The more your pain, the greater your experience.

0:31:02.840,0:31:07.480
You stayed so long in the same class.

0:31:07.480,0:31:16.620
In each class at university, you are supposed to spend one year, but you have a carry-over - a retake -

0:31:16.620,0:31:20.340
and you spend three years in the same class.

0:31:20.340,0:31:25.340
If you are serious, you would be more intelligent and wiser and learn a lot of lessons.

0:31:25.340,0:31:30.020
I think it is not too bad if you stayed long in a class.

0:31:30.020,0:31:36.320
You need to learn what you need to know before getting to where God wants you to be.

0:31:36.320,0:31:41.860
If not, you will be dislodged and replaced by satan.

0:31:41.860,0:31:50.360
Tell your neighbour, "You need to learn enough experience. If not, you will be dislodged –

0:31:50.360,0:31:58.900
I mean, replaced by satan".

0:31:58.900,0:32:11.020
You need to know the pain of being a poor man so as to maintain the position of a rich man.

0:32:11.020,0:32:18.380
You need to know the pain of being a sick man so as to maintain the position of good health.

0:32:18.380,0:32:26.320
You need to know the pain of being disappointed so as to maintain the position of appointment.

0:32:26.320,0:32:28.200
Brother - you are released.

0:32:28.200,0:32:29.380
[Amen.]

0:32:29.380,0:32:32.800
And I want to assure you - you are released.

0:32:32.800,0:32:34.080
[Amen.]

0:32:34.080,0:32:37.160
Thank You, Lord.
