Remember, satan has many ways he uses to connect people to himself.

0:07:12.000,0:07:17.800
It could be disobedience - he uses disobedience to connect you.

0:07:17.820,0:07:22.400
He can use hatred. These are his weapons.

0:07:22.400,0:07:27.900
He can use immorality. These are his weapons.

0:07:27.980,0:07:33.000
Once you are connected, you become an agent.

0:07:33.080,0:07:37.800
Now, we want to break all these - all these means!

0:07:37.800,0:07:44.200

0:13:08.100,0:13:15.100
If satan does not have connection,

0:13:15.160,0:13:20.900
if there is no wire between you and satan,

0:13:20.900,0:13:23.600
satan cannot even touch you.

0:13:23.600,0:13:26.300
SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:13:26.320,0:13:32.500
Some of his connections - disobedience, unfaithfulness

0:13:32.520,0:13:43.000
immorality, stealing, killing, destruction - these are the connection.

0:13:43.020,0:13:46.500
You are his tools and agent.

0:13:46.560,0:13:54.400
Now this is personal confession, open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.

0:13:54.460,0:14:02.500
Whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,

0:14:02.580,0:14:06.500
whether hatred, unfaithfulness or lying -

0:14:06.520,0:14:09.300
maybe sometimes you lie.

0:14:09.340,0:14:16.900
Whatever way satan might have used or is using to connect you to himself,

0:14:16.940,0:14:19.700

Break it!

0:15:33.140,0:15:39.300
In the name of Jesus!

0:15:39.320,0:15:42.900
We are talking of character.

0:15:42.900,0:15:47.500
God's Word reflects His character.

0:15:47.560,0:15:52.100
We are talking of salvation, now.

0:15:52.120,0:15:58.200
Something more than miracles. We are talking of the salvation of your soul.

0:15:58.200,0:16:01.000
That is what we are praying for.

0:16:01.080,0:16:06.600
The way satan connects you to himself and begin to toy with you...

0:16:06.660,0:16:12.200
You know tow vehicle - he will begin to tow you everywhere.

0:16:12.240,0:16:18.600
You become an agent. At night you say that somebody came and hit you.

0:16:18.660,0:16:22.500
Somebody came and had an affair with you but you cannot resist.

0:16:22.560,0:16:26.000
Why? Because satan has connected you to himself.

0:16:26.020,0:16:28.400
This is the experience many of you are having -

0:16:28.400,0:16:33.700
in your dream, when you wake up, you say: "Ah, my guest slept with me last night!"

0:16:33.780,0:16:37.200
And this is a guy in the physical, he respects you.

0:16:37.280,0:16:42.200
But at night he will ride you.

0:16:42.260,0:16:46.000
The reason you cannot resist is because you have become an agent.

0:16:46.060,0:16:51.100
Satan has connected you to himself and he has used this weapons -

0:16:51.100,0:16:54.820
weapons of unrighteousness, disobedience, immorality,

0:16:54.880,0:16:59.200
lying, stealing. Begin to disconnect yourself!

0:16:59.280,0:17:08.580
Disconnect yourself!

0:17:08.580,0:17:10.000
In the name of Jesus!

0:17:10.040,0:17:15.400
Say: "I disconnect myself!

0:17:15.420,0:17:21.300
Whatever weapon, whatever way satan might have used

0:17:21.360,0:17:25.000
to connect me to himself!" -

0:17:25.080,0:17:28.740
begin to disconnect yourself, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:28.740,0:17:45.100
SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:17:45.120,0:17:48.000
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:17:48.020,0:17:56.400
Viewers all over the world, I know, we are carrying you along - glory be to God!

0:17:56.480,0:18:01.700
It is happening in your home.

0:18:01.700,0:18:09.400
Those weapons satan uses are the fruits of the flesh -

0:18:09.460,0:18:17.800
immorality, disobedience, unfaithfulness, hatred,

0:18:17.800,0:18:20.940
unforgiving spirit - these are weapons.

0:18:20.940,0:18:25.120
And once he is using this to connect you to himself,

0:18:25.120,0:18:29.000
he will begin to tow you like a vehicle - you know, like towing a vehicle.

0:18:29.040,0:18:36.240
Anywhere he tows you, anywhere he drags you - you go, you become an agent. He can say: "Go!" or: "Сome!"

0:18:36.240,0:18:39.800
because you are being connected to satan. So therefore,

0:18:39.860,0:18:45.100
whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,

0:18:45.100,0:18:47.040
begin to disconnect yourself!

0:18:47.040,0:18:50.400
Viewers all over the world, begin to disconnect yourself!

0:18:50.400,0:18:52.380
Begin to disconnect yourself!

0:18:52.380,0:18:55.300
Disconnect yourself!

0:18:55.320,0:19:03.000
In the name of Jesus!

0:19:03.000,0:19:17.700
SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:19:17.780,0:19:20.220
Disconnect yourself as the man of God has said.

0:19:20.220,0:19:24.320
The evidence of the grace of Calvary is what we are witnessing in the life of people,

0:19:24.320,0:19:28.140
as they are vomiting, shouting, screaming and manifesting

0:19:28.140,0:19:33.020
coming out of their darkness. God is exposing the darkness in the life of the people

0:19:33.020,0:19:36.960
through the faculty of the man of God right now. Stay connected -

0:19:36.960,0:19:40.400
everywhere in the world, wherever you are viewing, stay connected.
