0:06:59.520,0:07:04.020
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

0:07:04.020,0:07:11.820
Remember, satan has many ways he uses to connect people to himself.

0:07:11.820,0:07:17.620
It could be disobedience - he uses disobedience to connect you.

0:07:17.620,0:07:22.260
He can use hatred; these are his weapons.

0:07:22.260,0:07:27.880
He can use immorality; these are his weapons.

0:07:27.880,0:07:32.920
Once you are connected, you become an agent.

0:07:32.920,0:07:37.800
Now, we want to break all these - all these means!

0:07:37.800,0:07:44.080
Begin to mention those things satan uses to connect you to himself.

0:07:44.080,0:07:49.760
You know those things, you know them. Mention them.

Viewers all over the world, what you are seeing is the manifestation of the evil spirits.

0:10:01.400,0:10:04.300
People are vomiting out all poisonous substances

0:10:04.300,0:10:08.540
that have  been deposited in their systems, they have been set free from the kingdom of darkness.

0:10:08.540,0:10:11.900
As you are watching the screen of your television, step in faith believing that

0:10:11.900,0:10:14.140
your case will not escape the anointing of God.

0:10:14.140,0:10:18.720
Distance is not a barrier, Jesus Christ is reachable, you can touch Him wherever you are.

0:10:18.720,0:10:22.120
Right now, touch the screen of your television and believe.

0:10:22.120,0:10:24.540
Break the connection!

0:10:24.540,0:10:32.580
It could be greediness, selfishness, killing or stealing.

0:10:32.580,0:10:41.600
It could be disobedience or unfaithfulness.

0:10:41.600,0:11:02.560
It could be hatred, stealing, killing, greediness or immorality - break it!

0:11:02.560,0:11:17.780
He holds the key to my life

0:11:21.820,0:11:26.180
Seem to take my soul away

0:11:26.180,0:11:49.800
He holds the key to my life

0:11:49.800,0:11:53.760
When sickness and sorrow

0:13:01.780,0:13:09.440
He holds the key to my life

0:13:09.440,0:13:14.960
If satan does not have connection,

0:13:14.960,0:13:20.900
if there is no wire between you and satan,

0:13:20.900,0:13:24.640
satan cannot even touch you.

0:13:24.640,0:13:26.080
SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:13:26.080,0:13:32.560
Some of his connections - disobedience, unfaithfulness

0:13:32.560,0:13:42.900
immorality, stealing, killing, destruction - these are the connections.

0:13:42.900,0:13:46.400
You are his tools and agent.

0:13:46.400,0:13:54.220
Now, this is personal confession; open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.

0:13:54.220,0:14:02.300
Whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,

0:14:02.300,0:14:06.260
whether hatred, unfaithfulness or lying -

0:14:06.260,0:14:09.260
maybe sometimes you lie -

0:14:09.260,0:14:16.440
w hatever way satan might have used or is using to connect you to himself,

0:14:16.440,0:14:19.460
open your lips and begin to break that connection!

0:14:19.460,0:14:21.640

0:15:31.500,0:15:33.020
Break it!

0:15:33.020,0:15:39.640
In the name of Jesus!

0:15:39.640,0:15:42.760
We are talking of character.

0:15:42.760,0:15:47.500
God's Word reflects His character.

0:15:47.500,0:15:52.000
We are talking of salvation, now.

0:15:52.000,0:15:57.960
Something more than miracles. We are talking of the salvation of your soul.

0:15:57.960,0:16:01.000
That is what we are praying for.

0:16:01.000,0:16:06.520
The way satan connects you to himself and begins to toy with you...

0:16:06.520,0:16:12.200
You know tow vehicle - he will begin to tow you everywhere.

0:16:12.200,0:16:14.760
You become an agent.

0:16:14.760,0:16:18.360
In the night you say that somebody came and hit you.

0:16:18.360,0:16:22.420
Somebody came and has    an affair with you but you cannot resist.

0:16:22.420,0:16:25.860
Why? Because satan has connected you to himself.

0:16:25.860,0:16:28.400
This is the experience many of you are having -

0:16:28.400,0:16:33.640
in your dream, when you wake up, you say: "Ah, my guest slept with me last night!"

0:16:33.640,0:16:37.160
And this is a guy in the physical, he respects you,

0:16:37.160,0:16:42.400
but at night he will ride you.

0:16:42.400,0:16:45.920
The reason you cannot resist is because you have become an agent.

0:16:45.920,0:16:50.940
Satan has connected you to himself and he has used this weapons -

0:16:50.940,0:16:57.080
weapons of unrighteousness, disobedience, immorality, lying, stealing.

0:16:57.080,0:16:59.220
Begin to disconnect yourself!

0:16:59.220,0:17:08.580
Disconnect yourself!

0:17:08.580,0:17:09.840
In the name of Jesus!

0:17:09.840,0:17:15.580
Say: "I disconnect myself!"

0:17:15.580,0:17:21.780
Whatever weapon, whatever way satan might have used

0:17:21.780,0:17:24.860
to connect me to himself -

0:17:24.860,0:17:29.520
begin to disconnect yourself, in the name of Jesus!

0:17:29.520,0:17:44.820
SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:17:44.820,0:17:48.040
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:17:48.040,0:17:56.720
Viewers all over the world, I know, we are carrying you along - glory be to God!

0:17:56.720,0:18:01.320
It is happening in your home.

0:18:01.320,0:18:08.760
Those weapons satan uses are the fruits of the flesh -

0:18:08.760,0:18:17.560
immorality, disobedience, unfaithfulness, hatred,

0:18:17.560,0:18:21.260
unforgiving spirit - these are weapons.

0:18:21.260,0:18:25.120
And once he is using this to connect you to himself,

0:18:25.120,0:18:29.100
he will begin to tow you like a vehicle - you know, like towing a vehicle.

0:18:29.100,0:18:35.300
Anywhere he tows you, anywhere he drags you - you go, you become an agent. He can say: "Go!" or: "Сome!",

0:18:35.300,0:18:38.000
because you are being connected to satan.

0:18:38.000,0:18:44.900
So therefore, whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,

0:18:44.900,0:18:47.040
begin to disconnect yourself!

0:18:47.040,0:18:50.400
Viewers all over the world, begin to disconnect yourself!

0:18:50.400,0:18:52.380
Begin to disconnect yourself!

0:18:52.380,0:18:55.240
Disconnect yourself!

0:18:55.240,0:19:03.000
In the name of Jesus!

0:19:03.000,0:19:17.460
SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:19:17.460,0:19:20.220
Disconnect yourself as the man of God has said.

0:19:20.220,0:19:24.320
The evidence of the grace of Calvary is what we are witnessing in the life of people,

0:19:24.320,0:19:30.180
as they are vomiting, shouting, screaming and manifesting, coming out of their darkness.

0:19:30.180,0:19:32.780
God is exposing the darkness in the life of the people

0:19:32.780,0:19:35.440
through the faculty of the man of God right now.

0:19:35.440,0:19:42.540
Stay connected - everywhere in the world, wherever you are viewing, stay connected.

0:19:42.540,0:19:49.300

0:21:32.660,0:21:43.180
Say, "Thank You for my salvation."

0:21:43.180,0:21:45.100
Right now, begin to confess these.

I submit myself to be an agent of truth,
