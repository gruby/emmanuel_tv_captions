0:02:59.820,0:03:05.120
Emmanuel
(God is with us, Matthew 1:23)

0:03:05.140,0:03:14.660
I'm so glad this morning, my name is 
Mrs Esabella Samtu from Togo.

0:03:14.660,0:03:18.520
The man beside me is my husband.

0:03:18.520,0:03:25.460
What brought us to Synagogue Church 
of all Nation is marital problem.

0:03:25.460,0:03:31.240
and then last week the man of God prophesied.

0:03:31.240,0:03:38.520
Telling us that there was a man over
 there whose wife wanted to divorced him.

0:03:38.520,0:03:43.040
Then he said that I took off my ring,

0:03:43.080,0:03:47.020
I have not been sleeping with
 him for a long time.

0:03:47.020,0:03:50.120
He also said moving to my room.

0:03:50.120,0:03:56.500
I confirm today that the prophecy
 is hundred percent true.

0:03:56.500,0:04:00.800
And then he prayed with us and cast away the spirit.

0:04:00.820,0:04:07.700
But before then I got marry to 
my husband six years ago.

0:04:07.700,0:04:13.040
He does everything a man 
can do for a woman to be happy.

0:04:13.040,0:04:15.660
But I had no affection for him.

0:04:15.660,0:04:19.040
When I planned on getting
 divorce with him,

0:04:19.040,0:04:24.760
he went ahead to take some 
drugs to kill himself.

0:04:24.760,0:04:30.060
We got scared of the whole
 thing and we rushed to God,

0:04:30.060,0:04:34.622
But God has opened up His hands
 to us and make things.

0:04:34.622,0:04:37.800
and put a smile on our face again

0:04:37.800,0:04:39.720
We are so happy.

0:04:39.720,0:04:47.620
[clapping]

0:04:47.700,0:04:52.797
Anytime he slept with me,
 I didn't like it as a man,

0:04:52.800,0:04:54.720
I didn't feel him.

0:04:54.720,0:05:02.180
It's got even to a time when he came to 
my office, I introduced him as my brother

0:05:02.180,0:05:05.960
I was not proud of him as a man besides me.

0:05:05.960,0:05:12.000
I even planned on going for another man, 
I even packed my things out from there.

0:05:12.000,0:05:17.429
I made my plans especially that when we
 come to Synagogue Church of All Nation

0:05:17.429,0:05:21.320
I was telling myself that the man of God would say that

0:05:21.320,0:05:25.540
he was not good for me and I would
 go and take my things out.

0:05:25.580,0:05:30.860
And then he was praying that God 
must restore this marriage.

0:05:30.860,0:05:37.680
He sees that God has made me
 for him and he was eager ready to do

0:05:37.680,0:05:42.260
everything a man could do to keep his marriage.

0:05:42.260,0:05:43.980
Emmanuel.

0:05:43.980,0:05:48.040
{You said you had taken off the wedding rings, 
tell us much more about that. }

0:05:48.040,0:05:54.160
Yes for about six months. 
I was not wearing the wedding ring.

0:05:54.160,0:06:00.300
I kept them,  I had them somewhere else.

0:06:00.300,0:06:06.920
But that day,  that same last week Sunday,
 I just asked for it when the spirit was out of me

0:06:06.920,0:06:09.280
I went for it myself.

0:06:09.280,0:06:14.820
Then I wore it,  and is when that
 thing happened before I realized

0:06:14.820,0:06:18.240
that the man was good for me.

0:06:18.240,0:06:21.180
He has so many potentials in him.

0:06:21.180,0:06:26.680
{Clap for Jesus!

0:06:26.680,0:06:29.560
Madam tell us what other changes you observed in

0:06:29.560,0:06:32.700
your relation with the husband's 
since that deliverance? Tell us.}

0:06:32.700,0:06:34.640
Oh, so good ones,

0:06:34.640,0:06:39.240
When we met as husband and wife,
 is when I realized that it change.

0:06:39.240,0:06:41.720
I liked it so much

0:06:41.720,0:06:46.300
[clapping]

0:06:46.300,0:06:53.460
And before I didn't like holding him, 
but right now I can hold him.

0:06:53.460,0:06:56.700
I can kiss him, I can do everything with him.

0:06:56.700,0:07:00.640
I'm proud to have him as my husband. 
Thank you!

0:07:00.700,0:07:06.100
{Lets put our hands together for Jesus,
 clap for Jesus

0:07:06.100,0:07:11.200

0:07:11.200,0:07:14.400

I would like to tell the whole world especially couples

0:07:42.040,0:07:45.760
in the same situation as we were having before

0:07:45.760,0:07:51.680
not to take decisions on their own 
they should seek the face of God.

0:07:51.680,0:07:56.100
God is capable of solving out the
 problem and put them together

0:07:56.100,0:07:59.880
and put another smile on their face.

0:07:59.920,0:08:01.570
Amen.

0:08:01.570,0:08:07.060
{Clap for Jesus Christ!

Mrs Isabella Samtu & Husband
prophecy testimony.

0:09:29.880,0:09:32.760
So he says he is thanking God for 
the life of prophet TB Joshua

0:09:32.760,0:09:34.300
for what God has done in his life.

0:09:34.300,0:09:36.880
He says the problem that brought him 
in SCOAN is a marital problem.

0:09:36.900,0:09:40.900
for a long time there was no affection
 and the wife told him

0:09:40.900,0:09:43.620
she wanted to leave him for many reasons,

0:09:43.620,0:09:48.420
first they have no child and second
 no affection in the relationship

0:09:48.420,0:10:47.620
Mrs Isabella Samtu & Husband 
prophecy testimony.

0:10:47.620,0:10:49.960
He says that when the problem became so tough

0:10:49.960,0:10:53.720
they decided to come to the arena
 of Liberty to seek the face of God.

0:10:53.720,0:10:56.079
And the wife had removed the ring already, meaning

0:10:56.080,0:10:59.060
she had taken the decision to leave him already.

0:10:59.060,0:11:00.780
So when they came here to the Church of God,

0:11:00.780,0:11:03.960
the man of God gave a word of 
prophecy and fetch them out

0:11:03.960,0:11:06.480
and exposed the root cause of their problem

0:11:06.480,0:11:11.020
and after the word of prophecy,
 they were delivered and restored.

0:11:11.020,0:11:12.690
{I want to ask you one question,

0:11:12.690,0:11:16.340
when your wife removed the ring
 what came to your mind?}

0:11:16.340,0:11:38.700
Mrs Isabella Samtu & Husband
prophecy testimony.

0:11:38.720,0:11:43.360
He said he was so confused, 
How can God unsettle a marriage?

0:11:43.360,0:11:45.640
Where the wife is praying for separation,

0:11:45.640,0:11:48.420
and the husband is praying for restoration.

0:11:48.420,0:11:50.060
So they decided to come to the arena
 of Liberty to seek the truth

0:11:50.060,0:11:51.920
- the face of God.

0:11:51.940,0:11:56.880

 God is alive and God is real.

their marriage and they are happy 
and give thank to God.

0:12:30.260,0:12:33.320
