0:00:00.060,0:00:10.280
There is a brother there that the wife is planning to leave him now.

0:00:10.280,0:00:11.560
Come on.

0:00:11.560,0:00:13.660
Why does your wife want to leave you?

0:00:13.660,0:00:14.800
She is there.

0:00:14.800,0:00:16.520
Why do you want to leave your husband?

0:00:16.520,0:00:17.840
I'm no more feeling okay.

0:00:17.840,0:00:21.720
You don't have feelings.

0:00:21.720,0:00:24.760
Come here. 
It is not that you don't have feelings.

0:00:24.760,0:00:26.320
Come on.

0:00:26.320,0:00:28.600
Come here!

0:00:28.600,0:00:30.560
She told you that she wants to leave you?

0:00:30.560,0:00:31.300
Yes.

0:00:31.300,0:00:36.680
Already for the past months, she 
has not been sleeping with you.

0:00:36.680,0:00:41.200
Yes, sir. I don't sleep with him any longer.

0:00:41.200,0:00:42.360
You don't sleep with him?

0:00:42.360,0:00:43.540
Yes.

0:00:43.540,0:00:45.540
You sleep in your room separately.

0:00:45.540,0:00:46.660
Yes.

0:00:46.660,0:00:49.240
She has removed the ring.

0:00:49.240,0:00:50.320
You have removed the ring?

0:00:50.320,0:00:51.300
Yes.

0:00:51.300,0:00:55.520
After the deliverance, she will now see the potential in you.

0:00:55.520,0:00:59.380
Come on!

0:00:59.380,0:01:02.780
Don't worry, she will see the good in you.

0:01:02.780,0:01:07.480
The good in you - she could not 
see it again because she was possessed

0:01:07.480,0:01:12.780
Come on. See this man.

0:01:12.780,0:01:14.700
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:01:14.700,0:01:17.200
It's alright.

0:01:17.200,0:01:37.080
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:01:37.080,0:01:42.520
Thank You, Jesus!

0:01:42.520,0:01:45.000
Set Free In Jesus' Name

0:01:45.000,0:01:50.280
Let's clap for Jesus!

0:01:50.280,0:01:55.640
Clap for Jesus once again!

0:01:55.640,0:02:00.940
Remember, Jesus has come to restore relationship.

0:02:00.940,0:02:05.240
Jesus has come to put an end to the past and give birth to the future.

0:02:05.240,0:02:10.060
Give thanks to Him.

0:02:10.060,0:02:14.000
Viewers all over the world, as you are watching, remember,

0:02:14.000,0:02:17.200
Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:02:17.200,0:02:18.620
And as the man of God says:

0:02:18.620,0:02:24.580
In a Christian home, misunderstanding leads to greater understanding.

0:02:24.580,0:02:28.480
So whatever challenges you are facing, listen to this testimony.

0:02:28.480,0:02:31.800
You will know that there is a way where there seems to be no way.

0:02:31.800,0:02:40.440
The way is Jesus Christ!
Give thanks to Him once again.

0:02:40.440,0:02:42.040
Hallelujah!

0:02:42.040,0:02:47.280
We are seeing you joyful because the Lord has done something in your life.

0:02:47.280,0:02:50.900
Hallelujah. Can you please introduce yourselves to our viewers

0:02:50.900,0:02:54.540
and tell us the testimony, what Jesus 
has done in your life,

0:02:54.540,0:03:00.680
in your marital life, in Jesus' name.

0:03:00.680,0:03:05.440
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:03:05.440,0:03:08.000
I'm so glad this morning.

0:03:08.000,0:03:14.880
My name is Mrs Esabella Samtu from Togo.

0:03:14.880,0:03:18.520
The man beside me is my husband.

0:03:18.520,0:03:25.960
What brought us to The SCOAN was a marital problem.

0:03:25.960,0:03:31.240
Last week, the man of God prophesied,

0:03:31.240,0:03:38.680
telling us that there was a man over there whose wife wanted to divorce him.

0:03:38.680,0:03:47.280
He said that I took off my ring and that I had not slept with him for a long time.

0:03:47.280,0:03:50.220
He also said I moved into my room.

0:03:50.220,0:03:56.400
I confirm today that the prophecy is hundred percent true.

0:03:56.400,0:04:01.340
He prayed with us and cast away the spirit.

0:04:01.340,0:04:08.120
It is almost six years that I have been married to my husband.

0:04:08.120,0:04:15.900
He did everything a man can do for a woman to be happy, yet I had no affection for him.

0:04:15.900,0:04:25.000
I heard that when I wanted to divorce him, he went and took some drugs to kill himself.

0:04:25.000,0:04:30.180
We got scared of the whole thing and rushed to God.

0:04:30.180,0:04:37.860
God has opened His hands to us and put a smile on our faces.

0:04:37.860,0:04:41.100
We are so happy.

0:04:47.620,0:04:54.880
Anytime he slept with me, I didn't like it; I didn't feel him.

0:04:54.880,0:05:02.100
There was a time he came to my office and I introduced him as my brother.

0:05:02.100,0:05:06.060
I was not proud of him as a man besides me.

0:05:06.060,0:05:11.880
I even planned to go to another man, and I had packed my things.

0:05:11.880,0:05:19.420
I had hoped that when we came to The SCOAN,

0:05:19.420,0:05:22.480
the man of God would say that he was not good for me.

0:05:22.480,0:05:25.860
Then, I would go and take my things out.

0:05:25.860,0:05:34.980
He was praying that God should restore his marriage because God had me for him.

0:05:34.980,0:05:42.280
He was eager to do everything a man could do to keep his marriage.

0:05:42.280,0:05:43.920
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:05:43.920,0:05:48.040
You said you had taken off the wedding rings. Tell us much more about that.

0:05:48.040,0:05:54.340
For about six months, I was not wearing the wedding rings.

0:05:54.340,0:06:00.380
I kept them somewhere else.

0:06:00.380,0:06:07.180
But that day - last week Sunday - I just asked for it when the spirit was out of me.

0:06:07.180,0:06:12.120
I went for it myself and wore it.

0:06:12.120,0:06:14.820
is when that
 thing happened before I realized

0:06:14.820,0:06:18.600
It is then that I realised that this man is good for me.

0:06:18.600,0:06:21.340
He has so much potential in him.

0:06:21.340,0:06:26.680
Clap for Jesus!

0:06:26.680,0:06:29.660
Madam, tell us what are the changes you observed in your relationship

0:06:29.660,0:06:32.640
with your husband since that deliverance.

0:06:32.640,0:06:35.280
Oh, so good ones.

0:06:35.280,0:06:39.460
When we met as husband and wife, I realised there was a change;

0:06:39.460,0:06:41.720
I liked it so much.

0:06:41.720,0:06:46.300

0:06:46.300,0:06:53.620
Before, I didn't like holding him while we were walking but right now, I can hold him.

0:06:53.620,0:06:56.900
I can kiss him and do everything with him.

0:06:56.900,0:07:01.240
I'm proud to have him as my husband.
Thank you!

0:07:01.240,0:07:11.500
Let's put our hands together for Jesus! Clap for Jesus!

0:07:11.500,0:07:14.880
Let someone say, "A new love has come.

0:07:14.880,0:07:17.880
A new understanding has come".

0:07:17.880,0:07:21.380
Who can justly do it?
- Jesus Christ, the Restorer.

0:07:21.380,0:07:27.300
Clap for Him once again.

0:07:27.300,0:07:31.240
Madam, there are many couples that are watching you right now all over the world,

0:07:31.240,0:07:34.440
who are going through the tough situation you went through.

0:07:34.440,0:07:38.760
What is your advice to them?

0:07:38.760,0:07:41.000
I would like to tell the whole world,

0:07:41.000,0:07:45.760
especially couples who are in the same situation as we were before,

0:07:45.760,0:07:49.620
not to take decisions on their own.

0:07:49.620,0:07:52.100
They should seek the face of God.

0:07:52.100,0:08:00.020
God is capable of solving the problem and put a smile on their face.

0:08:00.020,0:08:01.570
Amen.

0:08:01.570,0:08:06.980
Clap for Jesus Christ!

0:08:06.980,0:08:09.720
Sir, we are seeing you smiling. Tell us what God has done for you.

0:08:09.720,0:08:17.360
We want to hear from you your experience.

0:08:17.360,0:08:22.740
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:08:22.740,0:08:34.280
I give thanks to God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua, who allowed us to have joy today.

0:08:34.280,0:08:44.820
We came to the arena of liberty because we were having marital problems.

0:08:44.820,0:08:52.140
Some months ago, my wife decided to leave me.

0:08:52.140,0:09:03.620
There were different reasons for that decision.

0:09:03.620,0:09:13.660
First of all, she said she would leave me because she needed to have children.

0:09:13.660,0:09:21.240
She would say she had no feelings for me and that she felt oppressed; so, I should let her go.

0:09:21.240,0:09:29.600
I was confused and did not know who to confide in or where to find solution to the problem.

0:09:29.600,0:09:34.080
He is thanking God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua, for what God has done in his life.

0:09:34.080,0:09:37.000
The problem that brought him was a marital problem.

0:09:37.000,0:09:39.900
For a long time, there was no affection

0:09:39.900,0:09:43.480
and his wife told him that she wanted to leave him for many reasons.

0:09:43.480,0:09:48.320
First, they have no child and second, no affection in the relationship.

0:09:48.320,0:09:56.360
So, I was praying and I also consulted my two pastor friends who advised me.

0:09:56.360,0:10:06.400
He told me that he knew one place, the arena of liberty where I would find solution.

0:10:06.400,0:10:14.500
So, I decided to come to the arena of liberty.

0:10:14.500,0:10:23.460
Before we came, my wife had already removed her wedding ring but I brought it with me.

0:10:23.460,0:10:33.020
On Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied that there was a man whose wife wanted to leave him.

0:10:33.020,0:10:43.000
Immediately we came forward, the man of God prayed for us and we were delivered.

0:10:43.000,0:10:46.480
I want to ask you a question.

0:10:46.480,0:10:49.880
He said that when the problem became so tough,

0:10:49.880,0:10:53.720
they decided to come to the arena of liberty to seek the face of God.

0:10:53.720,0:10:56.079
The wife had removed the ring already,

0:10:56.080,0:10:59.060
meaning she had already taken the decision to leave him.

0:10:59.060,0:11:02.740
So when they came here to the church of God, the man of God gave a word of prophecy,

0:11:02.740,0:11:06.460
fetched them out and exposed the root cause of their problem.

0:11:06.460,0:11:10.820
After the word of prophecy, they were delivered and restored.

0:11:10.820,0:11:12.680
I want to ask you one question.

0:11:12.680,0:11:24.340
When your wife removed the ring, what came to your mind?

0:11:24.340,0:11:38.940
I came seeking God at the arena of liberty and I found solution. I confirm that God is here.

0:11:38.940,0:11:43.920
He said he was so confused - how can God unsettle a marriage

0:11:43.920,0:11:48.220
where the wife is praying for separation, and the husband is praying for restoration.

0:11:48.220,0:11:52.220
So they decided to come to the arena of liberty to seek the truth - the face of God.

0:11:52.220,0:11:57.200
He wants to tell everybody that God is alive and God is real.

0:12:09.600,0:12:22.280
After the deliverance, I feel happy and sleep like a new-born baby.

0:12:22.280,0:12:25.020
He says he is very happy and sleeps like
a baby.

0:12:25.020,0:12:28.940
God has restored their marriage and they are happy and give thanks to God

0:12:28.940,0:12:33.320
for the mighty works He has done through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:12:33.320,0:12:37.780
Many married men are having trouble.

0:12:37.780,0:12:44.680
Please, what is your advice to those watching you?

0:12:44.680,0:12:50.680
To every man in that same situation,

0:12:50.680,0:12:56.820
I advise them to be patient, pray and seek the face of God.

0:12:56.820,0:12:59.660
Only God has the solution to all fundamental issues of life.

0:12:59.660,0:13:02.620
He says that it is only God who has the answer to all your troubles.

0:13:02.620,0:13:05.620
Please don't listen to advice of people around you.

0:13:05.620,0:13:09.620
Don't take your own decision; come and seek the face of God.

0:13:09.620,0:13:13.100
When God comes, solution comes, in Jesus' name.

0:13:13.100,0:13:19.020
Let's clap for Jesus once again.

0:13:19.020,0:13:24.340
Madam, we want to hear your advice to all the people watching all over the world.

0:13:24.340,0:13:27.700
To the women, the wives that are having trouble in their marital life -

0:13:27.700,0:13:30.140
what is your advice to them?

0:13:30.140,0:13:34.660
I would like to tell all couples to always seek the face of God

0:13:34.660,0:13:40.360
before taking any kind of decision, no matter the situation.

0:13:40.360,0:13:42.800
Thank you!

0:13:42.800,0:13:47.480
Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
Let's clap for Him.
