0:00:01.240,0:00:03.800
My name is Nneamaka Edeh.

0:00:03.800,0:00:05.780
We come from Enugu State (Nigeria).

0:00:05.780,0:00:07.840
These are my siblings.

0:00:07.840,0:00:13.220
My parents died in 2005 and since then,

0:00:13.220,0:00:20.140
my sisters and I have been suffering for the past 5 years.

0:00:20.140,0:00:23.380
We have heard from the sister who said she is from Enugu State.

0:00:23.380,0:00:27.140
She said five years ago, their parents died and they have been orphans,

0:00:27.140,0:00:31.420
and she and the sister standing beside her have been the ones taking care of the siblings.

0:00:31.420,0:00:36.160
For the past five years since the death of their parents, they have been suffering.

0:00:36.160,0:00:38.820
Please, children of God, help us.

0:00:38.820,0:00:44.580
Who is caring for the house?

0:00:44.580,0:00:47.020
Just my sister and I.

0:00:47.020,0:00:50.980
My sister and I are sales girls in Enugu.

0:00:50.980,0:00:52.340
Are you not going to school?

0:00:52.340,0:00:53.720
I finished my secondary school

0:00:53.720,0:00:58.180
but my sister dropped out of secondary school while in SS1 after my parent's death.

0:00:58.180,0:01:02.560
This one is suffering from a shortage of blood

0:01:02.560,0:01:05.720
but there is no money to take her to hospital.

0:01:09.380,0:01:12.220
So what would you do to help them?

0:01:12.220,0:01:16.140
They are five in number. They should give each of them N100,000.

0:01:16.140,0:01:17.400
Put it in an account.

0:01:17.400,0:01:19.800
Please, people of God, come together and help.

0:01:29.340,0:01:32.060
Thank you, Man of God.

0:01:37.880,0:01:39.440
Thank you, Man of God.

0:01:39.440,0:01:42.200
May God continue to bless you.

0:01:45.460,0:01:53.140
I am very grateful, thank you.

0:01:53.140,0:01:54.540
Ukamaka Edeh - Enugu, Nigeria

0:01:54.540,0:01:58.380
My name is Ukamaka Edeh. I am from Enugu State.

0:01:58.380,0:02:05.180
These are my other sisters. For the past five years since our parents died,

0:02:05.180,0:02:09.560
we have been struggling to feed our younger ones.

0:02:09.560,0:02:14.340
I dropped out of secondary school in SS1.

0:02:14.340,0:02:19.580
So, we came down from Enugu State where I am a sales girl.

0:02:19.580,0:02:26.660
But now, I am happy for what the man of God has done for us,

0:02:26.660,0:02:29.180
for giving us hope.

0:02:33.880,0:02:38.260
We are their family, they can come home here; this is their home.

0:02:38.260,0:02:40.280
We want to know how they are doing.

0:02:40.280,0:02:44.120
The one that is sick will be prayed for.

0:02:44.120,0:02:47.540
Those who want to go to school, people of God, please support.

0:02:47.540,0:02:48.720
Thank you.

0:02:50.940,0:02:54.420
So, they should immediately join the scholarship scheme.

0:02:54.420,0:02:56.560
We will give scholarships to these children

0:02:56.560,0:02:59.240
and let them go back to school. Thank you.

0:03:05.980,0:03:08.580
STANDARD FOR LIFE

0:03:09.020,0:03:12.780
My name is Nneamaka Edeh. I am 22 years old.

0:03:12.780,0:03:18.880
These are my siblings. We are orphans from Enugu State, Nigeria.

0:03:18.880,0:03:21.220
We are members of the Catholic church.

0:03:21.220,0:03:24.480
The problem that brought us to The SCOAN

0:03:24.480,0:03:28.040
was that our parents have been late since 2005.

0:03:28.040,0:03:30.940
There is no money, nobody cares.

0:03:30.940,0:03:34.060
For those five years, I have been working as a sales girl.

0:03:34.060,0:03:36.960
This is my younger sister who dropped out of school.

0:03:36.960,0:03:39.560
For five years we have been suffering

0:03:39.560,0:03:42.400
because there is nobody to help us.

0:03:42.420,0:03:47.640
Things are rough, even to eat and to pay our house rent...

0:03:47.640,0:03:55.860
The worst is that my younger sister sitting there is sick with shortage of blood

0:03:55.860,0:03:59.660
but there is no money to take her to the hospital.

0:03:59.660,0:04:04.280
Yesterday, we came to The SCOAN by night bus.

0:04:04.280,0:04:10.220
Even when my parents were alive, I never saw this amount of money.

0:04:10.220,0:04:16.080
The man of God gave us N500,000, five bags of rice

0:04:16.080,0:04:21.240
and scholarships to any level we want to go to.

0:04:21.240,0:04:25.440
I am so happy; I don't know what to say.

0:04:25.440,0:04:28.820
I am short of words.

0:04:28.820,0:04:31.220
I thank God.

0:04:31.220,0:04:38.360
Since morning, I have been saying to myself, "Is this me and can God do this for me?"

0:04:38.360,0:04:41.680
I am so happy. I thank God and give Him the glory.

0:04:41.680,0:04:45.000
Before - I can't lie, this is in the presence of God -

0:04:45.000,0:04:48.580
at times, I slept with men because of money.

0:04:48.580,0:04:54.700
But I promised God that if He helps me and my family, all that rubbish will stop.

0:04:54.700,0:04:59.940
I will never go back to my past life. I really thank God for my life.

0:04:59.940,0:05:04.220
This is a great miracle which I never expected in my life.

0:05:04.220,0:05:10.200
My name is Ukamaka Edeh. Nneamaka is my elder sister.

0:05:10.200,0:05:11.960
I am the second born.

0:05:11.960,0:05:18.840
We are from Enugu State, Nigeria. For the past five years that our parents died,

0:05:18.840,0:05:23.100
we have been struggling to take care of our younger ones.

0:05:23.100,0:05:27.160
I am a sales girl like my sister.

0:05:27.160,0:05:32.300
Pastor T.B. Joshua gave us N500,000 and five bags of rice.

0:05:32.300,0:05:35.740
He also gave me and my younger ones scholarships

0:05:35.740,0:05:38.100
so that we can go back to school.

0:05:38.100,0:05:44.080
I am very grateful. May God bless T.B. Joshua.

0:05:44.080,0:05:47.880
My name is Edeh Chinyere.

0:05:47.880,0:05:51.360
I am very grateful because before, there was nothing to eat,

0:05:51.360,0:05:53.380
let alone go to school.

0:05:53.380,0:05:56.860
God has really answered our prayers because when we came here,

0:05:56.860,0:06:01.880
we received a cash gift of N500,000 and five bags of rice.

0:06:01.880,0:06:05.880
I am very grateful. May God bless T.B. Joshua.

0:06:05.880,0:06:07.980
My name is Miracle.

0:06:07.980,0:06:14.140
How do you feel today seeing the man of God blessing you with such huge amount of money -

0:06:14.140,0:06:22.440
N500,000 - five bags of rice, a copy of the Holy Bible, and this wonderful book?

0:06:22.440,0:06:26.000
I feel very happy.

0:06:26.000,0:06:29.560
My name is Chinedu.

0:06:29.560,0:06:32.020
I am sick.

0:06:32.020,0:06:35.860
I am short of blood.

0:06:35.860,0:06:40.660
My sisters don't have money to take care of me.

0:06:40.660,0:06:43.360
Now that you have come to a place where

0:06:43.360,0:06:46.580
Jesus Christ had paid the price for your healing,

0:06:46.580,0:06:49.500
and through the grace in the life of His anointed servant,

0:06:49.500,0:06:52.120
you are set free from your illness

0:06:52.120,0:06:55.340
and you have also been blessed by the anointed man of God

0:06:55.340,0:07:02.640
with N500,000, a copy of the Holy Bible, the Mirror book, and five bags of rice.

0:07:02.640,0:07:04.420
How do you feel?

0:07:04.420,0:07:06.180
I feel very happy.

0:07:06.180,0:07:10.100
Glory be to God that you can have a cause to smile

0:07:10.100,0:07:13.040
in spite of the pains that you are going through.

0:07:13.040,0:07:19.700
And indeed, Jesus Christ is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.

0:07:19.700,0:07:21.100
I am so happy.

0:07:21.100,0:07:26.560
My advice to people out there - because I know there are many people like us.

0:07:26.560,0:07:31.300
All I can say to them is that they should have faith and be patient with God.

0:07:31.300,0:07:36.000
God's time is the best. When God blesses you and lifts you up,

0:07:36.000,0:07:38.240
that is the best for everyone.

0:07:38.240,0:07:39.780
I really thank God.

0:07:39.780,0:07:44.340
The hope you have been given today, is an everlasting one

0:07:44.340,0:07:48.800
because you have just found a father that is greater than all fathers

0:07:48.800,0:07:51.560
and a friend that is closer than a brother.

0:07:51.560,0:07:56.240
That is Jesus Christ in the life of His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:07:56.240,0:07:58.800
And with what God Almighty has done in your lives,

0:07:58.800,0:08:02.460
we want to encourage you to stay in faith in Christ Jesus

0:08:02.460,0:08:06.000
and remember that it is for the salvation of your soul

0:08:06.000,0:08:09.680
that God Almighty has blessed you immensely.

0:08:09.680,0:08:14.160
And we want to pray that God will give you the inner grace

0:08:14.160,0:08:18.500
to live by the Word of God and this blessing you have received

0:08:18.500,0:08:21.000
will multiply in Jesus' name.

0:08:21.000,0:08:21.920
Amen.
