Thank you.

0:00:08.620,0:00:11.660
You may be seated. Thank you.

0:00:11.660,0:00:13.120
Hallelujah.

Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:20.460,0:00:26.280
Yes, we have seen the presence of God.

0:00:26.280,0:00:32.460
It is always like that in the climate in the presence of God.

0:00:32.460,0:00:34.940
You can see the climate.

0:00:34.940,0:00:42.160
You see the move where God is present.

0:00:42.160,0:00:46.120
The Bible says in the Book of John 10:34-35,

0:00:46.120,0:00:53.940
'If you call them gods from whom the Word of God came - the Scripture cannot be broken'.

0:00:53.940,0:00:58.140
The question: How do we know a man of God?

0:00:58.140,0:01:03.840
We know a man of God by the words he speaks.

0:01:03.840,0:01:09.760
The words he speaks represent his heart's desire.

0:01:09.760,0:01:13.440
Are you with me?

0:01:13.440,0:01:22.340
The words he speaks represent his heart's desire.

0:01:22.340,0:01:27.620
"Let there be light!" - and there is light. That is a man of God.

0:01:27.620,0:01:33.200
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:01:33.200,0:01:38.800
Take note: If the Word is not according to the Spirit of God,

0:01:38.800,0:01:46.860
it will remain meaningless, idle and oftentimes destructive.

0:01:46.860,0:01:49.360
Are you with me?

0:01:49.360,0:01:56.360
If the Word is not according to (the Spirit of God) -

0:01:56.360,0:02:00.700
because we shall be judged by the Word we (speak).

0:02:00.700,0:02:09.220
If the Word is not according to the truth of the Gospel, according to the Spirit of God,

0:02:09.220,0:02:16.960
the Word will remain meaningless and oftentimes destructive.

0:02:16.960,0:02:20.280
Remember what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.

0:02:20.280,0:02:23.680
That is what is happening to many of us:

0:02:23.680,0:02:30.200
If the words you speak are not according to God's Spirit,

0:02:30.200,0:02:36.140
because it is God's Spirit that reveals Jesus.

0:02:36.140,0:02:41.720
It is God's Spirit that makes the Word work.

0:02:41.720,0:02:44.780
The Word becomes a tool.

0:02:44.780,0:02:49.340
If the Word is not according to the Spirit of the Father,

0:02:49.340,0:02:56.640
it will remain idle, meaningless and oftentimes dangerous.

0:02:56.640,0:03:06.040
If you say 'Jesus' and the 'Jesus' you called is not according to the Spirit of God,

0:03:06.040,0:03:14.060
satan will ask you, "By what authority? Who are you?"

0:03:14.060,0:03:18.820
We have seen the true Gospel today.

0:03:18.820,0:03:25.360
We need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.

0:03:25.360,0:03:31.780
You have seen it; you have realised that God is reliable.

0:03:31.780,0:03:33.920
If I'm talking to you?

0:03:33.920,0:03:37.240
How many of us have realised that God is reliable?

0:03:37.240,0:03:40.600
I can't see your hand.

0:03:40.600,0:03:46.100
If you have realised that God is reliable, what else again?

0:03:46.100,0:03:53.300
Your faith will simultaneously grow.

0:03:53.300,0:03:58.820
Your love for Christ will simultaneously grow.

0:03:58.820,0:04:08.520
Your desire for Christ will simultaneously - side by side - lift up.

0:04:08.520,0:04:12.040
If your faith has grown today, let me see your hand.

0:04:12.040,0:04:17.480
Your faith, your love for Christ - so much!

0:04:17.480,0:04:19.140
Let me see your hand.

0:04:19.140,0:04:21.940
Your desire for Christ!

0:04:21.940,0:04:23.740
Hallelujah.

0:04:23.740,0:04:27.820
That is the work of the Holy Spirit.

0:04:27.820,0:04:41.680
Before we can repent, however, conviction must come.

0:04:41.680,0:04:47.980
Every day you get closer to God by the power of repentance.

0:04:47.980,0:04:53.540
The Bible says repentance is the greatest gift from God.

0:04:53.540,0:05:03.800
Repentance is possibly our greatest gift from God - that is conviction.

0:05:03.800,0:05:06.540
Conviction must come.

0:05:06.540,0:05:15.160
Conviction is the awakening of your conscience to the truth.

0:05:15.160,0:05:27.180
You and I have seen that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.

0:05:27.180,0:05:31.440
Do you know that God is greater than you and your problems?

0:05:31.440,0:05:32.940
Do you know that?

0:05:32.940,0:05:34.320
I can't hear you!

0:05:34.320,0:05:36.200
[Yes!]

0:05:36.200,0:05:39.240
That is conviction.

0:05:39.240,0:05:47.640
Before you can repent, however, conviction must come.

0:05:47.640,0:05:59.320
Conviction is the awakening of your conscience to the truth.

0:05:59.320,0:06:05.200
"Ah, I need to go and read my Bible again."

0:06:05.200,0:06:10.300
"Ah, I thought I have read, I have finished Genesis to Revelation."

0:06:10.300,0:06:12.920
"Ah, I thought I know the Bible."

0:06:12.920,0:06:16.840
"Ah, I thought I'm a prayer warrior."

0:06:16.840,0:06:20.620
"Ah, I thought I know God."

0:06:20.620,0:06:25.900
"Ah, I thought I live in the wilderness."

0:06:25.900,0:06:30.700
"Ah, I need to go and read my Bible again."

0:06:30.700,0:06:32.700
"Again and again."

0:06:32.700,0:06:49.780
Awakening of your conscience to the truth.

0:06:49.780,0:06:53.160
What is the next thing now? Ask yourself.

0:06:53.160,0:06:54.740
Concerning God.

0:06:54.740,0:07:09.360
Ask yourself, "What is the next thing concerning God?"

0:07:09.360,0:07:14.740
Ask yourself, "What is the next thing for me concerning God?"

0:07:14.740,0:07:21.260
The best answer for anyone of us is: I'm still a baby.

0:07:21.260,0:07:25.360
I need to know more.

0:07:25.360,0:07:27.900
"So, God can be so real?"

0:07:27.900,0:07:31.480
That is one of the questions you ask yourself.

0:07:31.480,0:07:40.080
"God can be so real?"

0:07:40.080,0:07:43.500
God is great.

0:07:43.500,0:07:45.240
Hallelujah.

0:07:45.240,0:07:48.200
God is great. That is God for you.
