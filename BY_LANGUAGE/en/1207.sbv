0:00:00.000,0:00:03.280
Hallelujah! (Amen)

0:00:03.280,0:00:05.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:05.280,0:00:11.140
BELIEVE AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:00:11.140,0:00:21.720
How can we believe in order to be filled by the Spirit of God?

0:00:21.720,0:00:24.240
That is the question you need to ask yourself.

0:00:24.240,0:00:28.720
How can I believe in order to be filled? Because

0:00:28.720,0:00:34.920
Without being filled, you can not live right?

0:00:34.920,0:00:43.060
It's difficult to live right without being filled.

0:00:43.060,0:00:45.880
So difficult to live right.

0:00:45.880,0:00:56.720
And You cannot obey the written Word without being filled.

0:00:56.720,0:01:03.220
Without being filled, it's like you are without a Helper.

0:01:03.220,0:01:07.860
because the Holy Spirit  is our Helper

0:01:07.860,0:01:17.720
How can one live without a Helper in times of temptation? Can you see?

0:01:17.720,0:01:19.300
Hallelujah!

0:01:19.300,0:01:22.080
So let's take our reading.

0:01:22.080,0:01:24.780
I will take it from the position of faith.

0:01:24.780,0:01:29.920
The Book of Hebrews, let's take our reading.

0:01:29.920,0:01:34.120
That is chapter 4.

0:01:34.120,0:01:42.200
"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands,

0:01:42.200,0:01:48.940
let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.

0:01:48.940,0:01:58.420
Verse 2: For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us just as they did;

0:01:58.420,0:02:04.940
but the message they heard was of no value to them.

0:02:04.940,0:02:10.880
because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.

0:02:10.880,0:02:19.960
Verse 3; Now we who have believed enter that rest , just as God has said....

0:02:19.960,0:02:25.440
So let me take you to verse 10.

0:02:25.440,0:02:41.580
for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works,(from your tension, pressure)just as God did from his.

0:02:41.580,0:02:49.680
Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish.

0:02:49.680,0:02:56.220
by following their example of disobedience."

0:02:56.220,0:02:59.340
Hallelujah!

0:02:59.340,0:03:07.400
So that is Hebrew 4; you take your reading from verse 1 good.

0:03:07.400,0:03:16.100
You also find time to read the book of James verse 2  from 14 to the end, that will really help.

0:03:16.100,0:03:26.320
The Book of John 16 verse 12 to the end.

0:03:26.320,0:03:33.520
And the Book of John 14 from verse 15 to the end.

0:03:33.520,0:03:44.000
And the Book of John 7 starting your reading from verse 37-39.

0:03:44.000,0:03:48.440
We just have to take from the angle of faith.

0:03:48.440,0:03:56.820
BELIEVE AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:03:56.820,0:04:01.000
Like I have said,

0:04:01.000,0:04:07.260
without being filled, you can not live right.

0:04:07.260,0:04:14.480
No one can do the work of goodness; God does.

0:04:14.480,0:04:24.860
You can do on your own but for selfish, classic and material reasons.

0:04:24.860,0:04:33.160
No one can do the work of obedience but God does as He wills.

0:04:33.160,0:04:35.000
You can do it, take note of that.

0:04:35.000,0:04:42.820
You can be obedient as a man but for reason known to you.

0:04:42.820,0:04:46.620
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:46.620,0:04:52.460
In that Book of John 7 verse 37-39

0:04:52.460,0:05:18.480
Jesus said, "If you believe in Me, you will receive the Holy Spirit."

0:05:18.480,0:05:29.880
The question you need to ask yourself: Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?

0:05:29.880,0:05:32.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:32.720,0:05:37.620
You ask that your question - you say you are a believer; we agree you are a believer.

0:05:37.620,0:05:46.620
But did you receive the Holy Spirit, when the Father said: 'If you believe in Me,

0:05:46.620,0:05:50.160
you will receive the Holy Spirit."

0:05:50.160,0:05:57.720
Jesus said, "Those who believe in Me should receive."

0:05:57.720,0:06:13.200
It is His will for every believer to receive, to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:06:13.200,0:06:15.700
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:15.700,0:06:17.400
Because without it -

0:06:17.400,0:06:22.160
without the Holy Spirit - you can not live right; you can not obey Him.

0:06:22.160,0:06:27.840
The Scripture, the Bible - you can not obey the Bible.

0:06:27.840,0:06:34.380
It's not possible. So since morning we have been glorifying His name.

0:06:34.380,0:06:37.720
We have been singing, reverencing Him. The Bible says:

0:06:37.720,0:06:42.800
Wherever Jesus is glorified, the Holy Spirit comes.

0:06:42.800,0:06:47.080
It means, without being filled, you can not glorify Him.

0:06:47.080,0:06:50.960
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:50.960,0:07:01.600
Since morning, you have been dancing. I see everyone dancing: "Be glorified!" Fine.

0:07:01.600,0:07:06.900
Wherever Jesus is honoured, the Holy Spirit comes.

0:07:06.900,0:07:10.600
It means, you cannot honour Him without the Holy Spirit.

0:07:10.600,0:07:19.320
You cannot reverence Him. "Jesus, Jesus!" You see people crying "Jesus".

0:07:19.320,0:07:22.200
How will you honour Jesus without the Holy Spirit?

0:07:22.200,0:07:26.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:26.660,0:07:35.200
There is truth in God's Word.

0:07:35.200,0:07:41.320
Without being filled with the Holy Ghost, you cannot understand that truth.

0:07:41.320,0:07:45.260
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:45.260,0:07:56.020
There is healing, deliverance, blessing and salvation in the Bible, in God's Word - the Bible you are carrying.

0:07:56.020,0:08:07.140
But all these can be unveiled to you, when you are filled with the Holy Ghost.

0:08:07.140,0:08:13.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:13.140,0:08:15.700
When you are filled with Holy Ghost.

0:08:15.700,0:08:20.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:20.900,0:08:29.920
A Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost is a Christian without a Helper.

0:08:29.920,0:08:33.000
In times of tribulation, no Helper.

0:08:33.000,0:08:37.160
In times of temptation, no Helper.

0:08:37.160,0:08:39.760
In times of trial, no Helper.

0:08:39.760,0:08:45.480
He will not permit the test to be too great.

0:08:45.480,0:08:50.200
To stay with Jesus is to stay with the Holy Ghost.

0:08:50.200,0:08:54.700
That is where our safety lies. Tell your neighbour.

0:08:54.700,0:08:58.360
That is where our safety lies.

0:08:58.360,0:09:03.880
To stay with Jesus is to stay with the Holy Ghost.

0:09:03.880,0:09:07.940
That is where our safety lies.

0:09:07.940,0:09:20.660
In times of temptation, tribulation, crisis - that is where our safety lies.

0:09:20.660,0:09:32.780
Can you see, while you are calling the name of Jesus, and it seems nothing to show?

0:09:32.780,0:09:42.020
You keep complaining, too much stress, too much tension, stress, tension.

0:09:42.020,0:09:45.520
To stay with Jesus is to stay with the Holy Ghost.

0:09:45.520,0:09:50.120
That is where our safety lies.

0:09:50.120,0:10:04.260
When you call Jesus without being filled, you can not see Jesus on the scene.

0:10:04.260,0:10:10.100
So many claim to be Christians.

0:10:10.100,0:10:20.460
Many of us claim to be believers - without being filled.

0:10:20.460,0:10:26.000
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:26.000,0:10:32.400
It's a crisis.Tell your neighbour, it's a crisis.

0:10:32.400,0:10:38.800
You say I'm your father and I am not your father. I don't even know you.

0:10:38.800,0:10:43.420
There is no way I can know you without the Holy Ghost.

0:10:43.420,0:10:46.720
But you keep claiming I'm your father.

0:10:46.720,0:10:49.860
There is no way I can be your father without the Holy Ghost.

0:10:49.860,0:10:53.780
You keep saying I'm your father but there is no way I can be your father without Holy Ghost.

0:10:53.780,0:10:55.680
It's a crisis.

0:10:55.680,0:10:57.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:57.940,0:11:08.680
Many Christians today do not know how to believe and express their faith.

0:11:08.680,0:11:09.880
Because the Bible says

0:11:09.880,0:11:18.280
there is power in our mouth. The belief in our hearts is released by faith out of our mouths.

0:11:18.280,0:11:31.880
But many of us today don't know how to believe and express our faith. Simple.

0:11:31.880,0:11:35.560
Faith is expressed through work.

0:11:35.560,0:11:40.380
By this work, faith is perfected.

0:11:40.380,0:11:45.780
Faith without work is dead.

0:11:45.780,0:11:48.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:48.840,0:11:54.220
And what is that work?

0:11:54.220,0:11:57.340
Let me give you one good example:

0:11:57.340,0:12:12.020
After prayer, you believe it is not going to rain and at the same time

0:12:12.020,0:12:16.200
you carry an umbrella along.

0:12:16.200,0:12:20.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:20.920,0:12:27.920
Are you with me? That is a simple example I can give you.

0:12:27.920,0:12:38.100
After you pray, you are about to go to work, and you look at the sky, it seems to be darker,

0:12:38.100,0:12:43.720
as if it's about to rain.

0:12:43.720,0:12:52.420
As a Christian, you pray. After prayer, you believe

0:12:52.420,0:12:54.420
it will not rain.

0:12:54.420,0:12:57.900
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:12:57.900,0:13:05.760
At the same time, you carry along an umbrella.

0:13:05.760,0:13:12.140
What is that for, as a Christian - the umbrella you carry?

0:13:12.140,0:13:19.220
This puts your faith to question.

0:13:19.220,0:13:21.320
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:21.320,0:13:24.240
This nullifies your faith.

0:13:24.240,0:13:27.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:27.240,0:13:35.960
This is a form of unbelief.

0:13:35.960,0:13:41.740
In case it rains, you bring out your umbrella.

0:13:41.740,0:13:46.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:13:46.340,0:13:58.600
Inconsistency of your belief makes you to carry an umbrella.

0:13:58.600,0:14:06.800
In case it rains - in case it does not rain.

0:14:06.800,0:14:11.740
But after you have prayed and God is not a man.

0:14:11.740,0:14:15.140
I don't know whether it will rain or it's not going to rain.

0:14:15.140,0:14:29.280
Inconsistency of your belief makes you to carry an umbrella along, in case it rains.

0:14:29.280,0:14:33.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:14:33.140,0:14:41.120
God is not a man; only faith pleases Him.

0:14:41.120,0:14:56.000
This means our heart is uneasy and restless.

0:14:56.000,0:14:59.640
This means our heart is what?

0:14:59.640,0:15:03.140
That is why we carry what? Umbrella.

0:15:03.140,0:15:05.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:05.480,0:15:12.760
This shows that we have not yet believed.

0:15:12.760,0:15:18.760
When one believes, he is at rest.

0:15:18.760,0:15:25.140
When a person believes, he will no longer worry or doubt.

0:15:25.140,0:15:28.660
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:15:28.660,0:15:35.740
Even your business, you really show that you are not a Christian.

0:15:35.740,0:15:44.440
There are so many business cards you have - in case this fails, you do this.

0:15:44.440,0:15:52.200
You are a contractor, you are this. Even you express it in the life of your children.

0:15:52.200,0:15:56.880
First choice, second choice.

0:15:56.880,0:16:02.840
You train them with unbelief.

0:16:02.840,0:16:15.160
If you believe in God in a certain matter, you should have a work of faith in that matter.

0:16:15.160,0:16:17.720
Are you with me? Tell your neighbour:

0:16:17.720,0:16:28.500
If you believe in God in a certain matter, you should have  work of faith in that matter.

0:16:28.500,0:16:40.200
You believe it will not rain - why do you carry an umbrella?

0:16:40.200,0:16:47.840
That shows that something is wrong with your faith; that shows your faith is false.

0:16:47.840,0:16:53.240
I will take it one by one because I want to lead you to the Spirit of God.

0:16:53.240,0:16:58.840
I just want to carry you there. I will carry you by force.

0:16:58.840,0:17:04.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:04.080,0:17:08.560
If you insist, I know what to do.

0:17:08.560,0:17:13.080
You can resist, I know what to do.

0:17:13.080,0:17:20.300
But I don't want to rush you. I want to take you like Sunday school, kindergarten.

0:17:20.300,0:17:32.360
"A,B,C,D". Next, tomorrow we start from "E,F,G".

0:17:32.360,0:17:39.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:17:39.180,0:17:44.300
You know the work of faith now.

0:17:44.300,0:17:57.280
Faith is expressed through work; by this work, faith is perfected.

0:17:57.280,0:18:02.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:02.840,0:18:24.900
You pray over some trouble but you are busy planning on your own, worried and full of anxiety,

0:18:24.900,0:18:32.880
as if you have never prayed at all.

0:18:32.880,0:18:36.080
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:18:36.080,0:18:51.340
You pray over some trouble but you are busy planning your own strategy,

0:18:51.340,0:19:01.560
in case that prayer is not answered. Strategy where: "I bought a ticket, I will go and see a certain person..."

0:19:01.560,0:19:04.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:04.160,0:19:14.420
"Witchdoctor..." Strategy, tactic, busy planning your own strategy.

0:19:14.420,0:19:24.120
Worry and anxiety as, if you have never prayed at all.

0:19:24.120,0:19:26.880
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:26.880,0:19:38.380
And prayer of faith must be followed by an absolute trust in God

0:19:38.380,0:19:43.100
that He is now working out the answer.

0:19:43.100,0:19:52.300
But the opposite is your case. Your issue is a different one, and you want to receive Holy Spirit.

0:19:52.300,0:19:56.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:19:56.860,0:19:57.920
Tell your neighbour.

0:19:57.920,0:20:07.920
Prayer of faith must be followed by an absolute trust in God

0:20:07.920,0:20:14.620
that He is now working out the answer.

0:20:14.620,0:20:24.340
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:24.340,0:20:27.300

0:20:32.880,0:20:40.520
You attain big anointing, you run after the small anointing.

0:20:40.520,0:20:43.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:20:43.480,0:20:47.720
You run into upper anointing, you run into small anointing.

0:20:47.720,0:20:53.340
Tell me why it will not be affected, your life.

0:20:53.340,0:21:04.020
You run to specialist, professor who is specialized on a certain matter. After leaving the place,

0:21:04.020,0:21:11.140
you now run to quack people, those who kill people to treat you again.

0:21:11.140,0:21:15.300
Tell me why this quack thing will not spoil the one of specialist.

0:21:15.300,0:21:17.180
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:17.180,0:21:23.660
A lot of people have touched you, you are always to pray for, you don't know who is praying for you -

0:21:23.660,0:21:30.160
whether he is a religious man, whether he is this, whether he is a spiritualist, a lot of hands.

0:21:30.160,0:21:35.740
After prayer and you have been blessed, a lot of hands will remove those blessings again.

0:21:35.740,0:21:44.280
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:21:44.280,0:21:48.480
"Pray for me" - and you don't know who is praying for you -

0:21:48.480,0:21:54.320
whether he is removing the anointing in your life or he is decreasing or multiplying,

0:21:54.320,0:21:57.520
or he is dividing the anointing in your life.

0:21:57.520,0:22:00.980
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:22:00.980,0:22:07.460
That is why you see people receiving breakthrough, after a while - again downfall.

0:22:07.460,0:22:14.160
Because he is running from one specialist to quack,

0:22:14.160,0:22:20.480
to those who can divide his life. This is life we live today.

If you know who is praying for you, you will not want him to pray for you.

0:22:28.740,0:22:31.780
Because he is going to destroy you.

0:22:31.780,0:22:40.040
And if you know who is praying for you, you will ask him to pray for you and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

0:22:40.040,0:22:41.080
Say it again.

0:22:41.080,0:22:44.020
Believe and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

0:22:44.020,0:22:45.240
I can't hear you.

0:22:45.240,0:22:47.800
Believe and be filled with the Holy Spirit

0:22:47.800,0:22:52.680
The reason why we have to go through faith is very important. We can't just jump.

0:22:52.680,0:22:57.140
The Bible says in John 7:37-39, it says:

0:22:57.140,0:23:02.640
'If you believe in Me, you will receive the Holy Ghost.'

0:23:02.640,0:23:06.940
If I start there, it will be very difficult for you to understand what I am talking about.

0:23:06.940,0:23:13.900
But the whole thing comes from faith.

0:23:13.900,0:23:17.940
So we enter through the angle of faith.

0:23:17.940,0:23:24.740

0:23:24.740,0:23:28.420
The tablet, the medicine doctor has  given you...

0:23:28.420,0:23:37.160
If you don't believe in God with medicine, you cannot believe in God without medicine.

0:23:37.160,0:23:40.140
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:23:40.140,0:23:46.000
You say: "This my tablet, I don't know - whether I should take it. Is it Jesus wanting me to..."

0:23:46.000,0:23:56.660
If you don't believe in God with the tablet, the medicine you have,

0:23:56.660,0:24:01.480
you cannot believe in Him without the tablet.

0:24:01.480,0:24:09.100
The tablet, the medicine is nature. It's mere nature, it was fathomed from the nature,

0:24:09.100,0:24:12.320
and nature is of God.

0:24:12.320,0:24:15.160
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:15.160,0:24:21.520
You see, when I say I can't see any Christian. I am only looking at religious people.

0:24:21.520,0:24:25.580
I repeat again. Where is Christian here?

0:24:25.580,0:24:33.260
Going by the message, where is Christian?

0:24:33.260,0:24:36.960
So I need to explain. This is what I have explained today.

0:24:36.960,0:24:39.680
BELIEVE AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

0:24:39.680,0:24:44.620
This is a common thing. The issue of umbrella I used is a common thing.

0:24:44.620,0:24:47.960
I mean, there is Christian here.

0:24:47.960,0:24:50.920
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:24:50.920,0:24:54.960
Christian without a Helper.

0:24:54.960,0:25:01.160
You need a Helper in times of temptation, tribulation

0:25:01.160,0:25:09.700
because He promised He will not leave us without a Helper.

0:25:09.700,0:25:13.140
So please work on this message. Work on it.

0:25:13.140,0:25:17.340
I have given you those tests. Begin to work on it. Work on it, work on it.

0:25:17.340,0:25:24.020
And don't forget about your business of the today.

0:25:24.020,0:25:30.880
Meditation. Constant meditation. Continue to meditate.

0:25:30.880,0:25:36.540
Don't deceive yourself with prayer, shouting.

0:25:36.540,0:25:41.200
You need to know what would have come if that prayer...

0:25:41.200,0:25:44.820
You have not reached that level of offering, when you stand up and begin to say:

0:25:44.820,0:25:50.140
"In Jesus' name, give me biscuit. Give me bread." Do you know the Jesus you are talking to?

0:25:50.140,0:25:52.500
If you know Him, He will reply to you.

0:25:52.500,0:25:56.360
But you always talk and He never talks.

0:25:56.360,0:26:04.780
Your prayer is one sided.You always talk in your prayer but you never hear the One you are talking to:

0:26:04.780,0:26:11.840
"Ok, it's alright, don't worry. I will not give you now, so please, the reason why I will not give you

0:26:11.840,0:26:17.360
is because of this, because of that, ok, it's alright". Before you say "In Jesus' name. Amen."

0:26:17.360,0:26:23.100
But you never hear from Him. It's only you that always talk in the prayer,

0:26:23.100,0:26:26.960
and prayer is two-sided.

0:26:26.960,0:26:30.380
It's what?

0:26:30.380,0:26:35.760
Two-sided conversation - you talk and Jesus talks.

0:26:35.760,0:26:43.160
"In Jesus' name, I need biscuit." He will tell you: "Ok, that biscuit, don't worry - I will give you not now."

0:26:43.160,0:26:50.160
You can shift your request again: "Ok, if you are not giving me biscuit, when are you going to give me, sir?"

0:26:50.160,0:26:53.860
"Ok, I will give you at the right time." - "Ok, sir."

0:26:53.860,0:26:56.980
But do you hear from Him?

0:26:56.980,0:27:02.480
But it's you that always talk and talk and talk. When someone knock son your door, you open it.

0:27:02.480,0:27:04.340
You ignore your prayer.

0:27:04.340,0:27:06.480
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:27:06.480,0:27:12.720
So now start from the foundation. Don't let us deceive ourselves. Meditation now.

0:27:12.720,0:27:14.820
Prepare your heart for God.

0:27:14.820,0:27:20.560
Your heart is not a dwelling place yet.

0:27:20.560,0:27:22.860
You have to prepare your heart.

0:27:22.860,0:27:30.900
There's a conflict between the flesh and spirit; there is a division.

0:27:30.900,0:27:36.900
Go - don't go, for - against, in your heart. A lot is going on in your heart.

0:27:36.900,0:27:43.420
Get your heart set by meditation,

0:27:43.420,0:27:50.920
hymns, spiritual songs, melodies

0:27:50.920,0:27:54.100
Get your heart ready; He will soon enter.

0:27:54.100,0:28:00.340
When He enters, you will just see prayer coming naturally. It comes -

0:28:00.340,0:28:05.020
not the one you fashion, not the one you form by yourself.

0:28:05.020,0:28:10.720
You want to pray: "I have a headache, Lord Jesus, can You heal me?"

0:28:10.720,0:28:13.800
As if Jesus does not know that you have headache.

0:28:13.800,0:28:16.540
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:16.540,0:28:21.020
When He is not dead. "I have cancer, heal me, Lord."

0:28:21.020,0:28:23.900
As if He Himself does not know you have cancer.

0:28:23.900,0:28:26.400
Isn't He is your Creator?

0:28:26.400,0:28:31.880
How can your Creator not know you? And you are now telling your Creator what you are going through,

0:28:31.880,0:28:33.660
ignorant.

0:28:33.660,0:28:41.860
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:28:41.860,0:28:47.960
"I am barren, I have been looking for fruit of the womb, Lord, deliver me".

0:28:47.960,0:28:52.640
How can you believe that God does not know what you are going through.

0:28:52.640,0:29:03.460
You are a clay. You are just a pen - that you use pen to write. But the One that is holding the pen -

0:29:03.460,0:29:09.320
that is your creator. And you - pen that we are using to write.

0:29:09.320,0:29:17.380
How can that pen now be telling the One that is holding it: "Look, I don't have ink inside me?

0:29:17.380,0:29:23.140
I can not write anymore." If you hear from the pen like that you will not drop it and run away?

0:29:33.880,0:29:42.340
We are Christians without a Helper.

0:29:42.340,0:29:43.780
Tell your neighbour.

0:29:43.780,0:29:52.900
You are a Christian without a Helper because you are not yet filled.

0:29:52.900,0:29:54.160
Tell your neighbour

0:29:54.160,0:30:03.780
If you are not yet filled, you can be a Christian as you proclaim, without a Helper.

0:30:03.780,0:30:10.180
Helper in times of temptation, in times of tribulation. Helper -

0:30:10.180,0:30:16.180
He helps us in our struggles.

0:30:16.180,0:30:20.600
He is there in our struggles.

0:30:20.600,0:30:25.820
You are here, you know what I have gone through in this ministry.

0:30:25.820,0:30:28.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:30:28.020,0:30:33.160
You know what I have gone through. Without that Helper - do you think I can still...

0:30:33.160,0:30:38.320
It's not possible. Even all of you, you know in the past, when you were at home,

0:30:38.320,0:30:44.160
you were not be able to eat. When you were eating, you dropped your food and said:

0:30:44.160,0:30:46.380
"Is that the end of the Synagogue?

0:30:46.380,0:30:51.160
T.B. Joshua - that is the end. What is going to happen next?" Oh my God.

0:30:51.160,0:30:58.020
That Helper, you need.
