The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:01.280,0:00:05.980
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:05.980,0:00:07.980
You may be seated; thank you.

0:00:07.980,0:00:12.840
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:12.840,0:00:15.020
There is so much blessing around.

0:00:15.020,0:00:22.520
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:00:22.520,0:00:27.000
I'm here to receive my own portion.

0:00:27.000,0:00:32.760
You know, what is good needs prayer, what is little needs prayer

0:00:32.760,0:00:35.580
and what is bad also needs prayer.

0:00:35.580,0:00:37.580
So I'm here to receive my own portion.

0:00:37.580,0:00:39.220
In Jesus' name.

0:00:39.220,0:00:41.820
[Amen!]

0:00:41.820,0:00:48.080
You are what you do, not what you say.

0:00:48.080,0:00:53.600
You are saying, "Jesus is Lord, Jesus is this" during time of confession.

0:00:53.600,0:00:59.460
But the Bible says, you are what you do, not what you say.

0:00:59.460,0:01:09.200
This shows you have to match your action with your words

0:01:09.200,0:01:19.080
because knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.

0:01:19.080,0:01:25.000
Tell your neighbour, "Match your action with your words".

0:01:25.000,0:01:26.180
I can't hear you.

0:01:26.180,0:01:28.180
[Match your action with your words.]

0:01:28.180,0:01:31.680
So all what you have been confessing, "Jesus is my Lord,

0:01:31.680,0:01:35.180
I will forgive my neighbour, I will do this, I will do that" -

0:01:35.180,0:01:38.040
you have to match it with your action.

0:01:38.040,0:01:41.820
When you get home, right from here, you begin to prepare your way.

0:01:41.820,0:01:46.460
When you know there is anything you have been doing in the past, before now,

0:01:46.460,0:01:48.940
it is time now to change.

0:01:48.940,0:01:50.520
This is it.

0:01:50.520,0:01:53.120
You are what you do, not what you say.

0:01:53.120,0:01:54.080
Tell your neighbour.

0:01:54.080,0:01:56.600
[You are what you do, not what you say.]

0:01:56.600,0:01:57.740
I can't hear you.

0:01:57.740,0:01:59.980
[You are what you do, not what you say.]

0:01:59.980,0:02:05.780
So please, it is very important.

0:02:05.780,0:02:11.220
What are you taking home to maintain your holiness?

0:02:11.220,0:02:16.720
Right now, we are ex-losers.

0:02:16.720,0:02:20.960
Right now, you are an ex-loser.

0:02:20.960,0:02:25.600
Say, right now, I'm an ex-loser!

0:02:25.600,0:02:36.060
What are you taking home to maintain your life - Christ's life of holiness?

0:02:36.060,0:02:39.140
Because you have to maintain what you have received now.

0:02:39.140,0:02:43.740
You know that immediately you leave here, it is a different thing.

0:02:43.740,0:02:52.620
You meet a lot of friends - those who divide, those who subtract.

0:02:52.620,0:02:54.960
A lot of friends.

0:02:54.960,0:03:00.100
You cannot succeed alone; you need good people.

0:03:00.100,0:03:05.180
What are you taking home to maintain what you have received?

0:03:05.180,0:03:06.540
Just think about this.

0:03:06.540,0:03:08.820
Maintenance is very important.

0:03:08.820,0:03:10.820
Ask yourself, "What am I taking home?

0:03:10.820,0:03:15.200
All what I have been seeing - to maintain the life I have received today".

0:03:15.200,0:03:22.260
You have received a new life - life without affliction,

0:03:22.260,0:03:29.280
a new life - life without failure,
a new life - life without rejection,

0:03:29.280,0:03:36.020
a new life - life without hatred,
a new life - life without tribulation.

0:03:36.020,0:03:39.600
Ask yourself, "What am I taking home to maintain this life?"

0:03:39.600,0:03:42.600
That is the question now.

0:03:42.600,0:03:46.160
I'm seeing new people, a new beginning - everyone.

0:03:46.160,0:03:48.400
But the question remains:

0:03:48.400,0:03:50.920
How will you maintain this life?

0:03:50.920,0:03:53.060
You have been very quiet.

0:03:53.060,0:03:55.760
You know the kind of life we live.

0:03:55.760,0:03:58.760
You have friends over there, people out there.

0:03:58.760,0:04:03.520
So this is what we should be thinking about, right now.

0:04:03.520,0:04:12.080
The Bible makes us to understand about genuine humility.

0:04:12.080,0:04:25.520
Before honour is humility.

0:04:25.520,0:04:28.160
We don't have enough time to talk about humility.

0:04:28.160,0:04:32.140
Humility is not to put on rags, it is not "Good Morning, sir",

0:04:32.140,0:04:36.120
beginning to greet everyone - this is what we display. No!

0:04:36.120,0:04:42.860
Before honour is humility.

0:04:42.860,0:04:50.080
Unless we are humble, we will not bow to Jesus.

0:04:50.080,0:04:57.820
Tell your neighbour, "Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus".

0:04:57.820,0:04:59.040
I cannot hear you.

0:04:59.040,0:05:00.440
[Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus.]

0:05:00.440,0:05:02.120
Tell your neighbour.

0:05:02.120,0:05:05.440
[Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus.]

0:05:05.440,0:05:11.180
Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus.

0:05:11.180,0:05:13.100
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:05:13.100,0:05:18.220
You say, "Ah, I'm very humble, that is why I'm in the church".

0:05:18.220,0:05:28.180
That is not the kind of humility we are talking about.

0:05:28.180,0:05:43.560
Humility will not do, hear or say without question but will ask Jesus

0:05:43.560,0:05:50.060
because Jesus is all the world to us.

0:05:50.060,0:05:56.380
Jesus is all the world to us.

0:05:56.380,0:06:03.200
Tell your neighbour, "Jesus is all the world to me".

0:06:03.200,0:06:04.400
I can't hear you.

0:06:04.400,0:06:06.980
[Jesus is all the world to me.]

0:06:06.980,0:06:08.120
I can't hear you.

0:06:08.120,0:06:10.460
[Jesus is all the world to me.]

0:06:10.460,0:06:11.420
Again.

0:06:11.420,0:06:13.360
[Jesus is all the world to me.]

0:06:13.360,0:06:15.800
That means, you have no other life.

0:06:15.800,0:06:20.580
You want to sit down, you ask Jesus, "How will I sit down?"

0:06:20.580,0:06:25.160
You want to talk, you ask Jesus, "Will I talk?"

0:06:25.160,0:06:30.740
You want to look, you ask Jesus, "Will I look? Will I greet?"

0:06:30.740,0:06:34.140
You want to dress up, you ask Jesus,

0:06:34.140,0:06:37.120
meaning you know how much you need Him.

0:06:37.120,0:06:49.420
He is all the world to me - my life, my joy, my all!

0:06:49.420,0:06:57.440
Tell your neighbour, "My life, my joy, my all!"

0:06:57.440,0:06:58.920
I can't hear you.

0:06:58.920,0:07:02.480
[My life, my joy, my all!]

0:07:02.480,0:07:03.920
Again and again.

0:07:03.920,0:07:07.600
[My life, my joy, my all!]

0:07:07.600,0:07:13.140
Jesus is all the world to me.

0:07:13.140,0:07:16.300
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:07:16.300,0:07:18.800
You want to look - Jesus!

0:07:18.800,0:07:21.120
You want to sit - Jesus!

0:07:21.120,0:07:23.740
You want to greet, before you greet - Jesus!

0:07:23.740,0:07:27.780
You want to comb your hair - Jesus!

0:07:27.780,0:07:32.160
You want to eat - Jesus!

0:07:32.160,0:07:37.440
To maintain the life you have received today,

0:07:37.440,0:07:45.120
this is the procedure - Jesus must be all the world to you.

0:07:45.120,0:07:51.980
He is our strength from day to day.

0:07:51.980,0:08:00.420
He is my strength from day to day.

0:08:00.420,0:08:01.800
Say to your neighbour.

0:08:01.800,0:08:04.800
[He is my strength from day to day.]

0:08:04.800,0:08:11.820
Jesus is my strength from day to day.

0:08:11.820,0:08:15.940
Look, I want to move - Jesus!

0:08:15.940,0:08:18.780
Another leg - Jesus!

0:08:18.780,0:08:21.440
Back again - Jesus!

0:08:21.440,0:08:24.440
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:24.440,0:08:25.720
Tell your neighbour again.

0:08:25.720,0:08:37.120
Jesus is my strength from day to day; you don't have any other strength.

0:08:37.120,0:08:42.900
This means, the life you are living is not yours.

0:08:42.900,0:09:07.920
Oh how I love Jesus

0:09:07.920,0:09:17.940
Because He went for me

0:09:17.940,0:09:20.940
Did you listen to that?

0:09:20.940,0:09:24.480
Listen to that.

0:09:24.480,0:09:29.700
He went for you.

0:09:29.700,0:09:34.680
What manner of man is Jesus?

0:09:34.680,0:09:44.420
To maintain the life you have received now - this is a new beginning -

0:09:44.420,0:09:53.000
Jesus must be your strength from day to day.

0:09:53.000,0:10:04.320
Jesus must be your strength to maintain what you have received now.

0:10:04.320,0:10:06.320
Are you thinking about that?

0:10:06.320,0:10:09.880
For you to know that you have not been maintaining that life.

0:10:09.880,0:10:15.880
You can sit on your own - you just sit down, without relying on Him.

0:10:15.880,0:10:20.520
You just talk, you say, "Come here!"

0:10:20.520,0:10:25.920
Before you say that, "Jesus, come here!", He will guide you.

0:10:25.920,0:10:33.380
Because it is an independent mind.

0:10:33.380,0:10:36.360
I want to pray with you now.

0:10:36.360,0:10:39.420
Remember, you have received it all.

0:10:39.420,0:10:44.140
I am only just coming here to encourage you

0:10:44.140,0:10:51.340
and to make sure no one leaves here without being transformed.

0:10:51.340,0:10:52.800
Rise up for prayer.

0:10:52.800,0:10:56.240
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:10:56.240,0:11:02.540
Regardless of what you are going through - take note of that.

0:11:02.540,0:11:06.920
Regardless of what you are going through.

0:11:06.920,0:11:17.120
Say, "Regardless of what I am going through in the natural".

0:11:17.120,0:11:19.760
You can be having a headache now.

0:11:19.760,0:11:25.060
But above, over there, the headache is gone.

0:11:25.060,0:11:32.820
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:11:32.820,0:11:37.040
Take note of that. I want you to understand it before I offer my prayer to you.

0:11:37.040,0:11:39.040
You must know this.

0:11:39.040,0:11:45.560
Regardless of what you are going through in the natural.

0:11:45.560,0:11:50.000
It means, you can be in trouble now.

0:11:50.000,0:11:56.820
Not in the natural but over there, above, there is no trouble.

0:11:56.820,0:12:04.620
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:12:04.620,0:12:08.300
"Ah, I don't know why this is happening to me."

0:12:08.300,0:12:14.400
But you don't know whether what is happening to you is still happening to you in the spirit.

0:12:14.400,0:12:19.160
If what is happening to you now is not happening to you in the spirit,

0:12:19.160,0:12:23.540
definitely, you are blaspheming.

0:12:23.540,0:12:25.540
Someone is working out the answer -

0:12:25.540,0:12:29.240
what God is working out for you now.

0:12:29.240,0:12:34.420
Regardless of what you are going through in the natural -

0:12:34.420,0:12:46.660
it may be painful in the natural, it may be rough in the natural -

0:12:46.660,0:12:51.980
Jesus says, "The way out for you has come!"

0:12:51.980,0:12:54.680
Are you taking my word?

0:12:54.680,0:13:04.740
Jesus says, "The way out for you has come!"

0:13:04.740,0:13:09.700
By the time you leave here - you will leave here today, tomorrow or any other day -

0:13:09.700,0:13:15.760
you will say, "Yes"; you will send me an email, "You have said it T.B. Joshua".

0:13:15.760,0:13:17.920
Why can't you begin to rejoice?

0:13:17.920,0:13:27.440
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:13:27.440,0:13:32.080
Yes.

0:13:32.080,0:13:36.120
You have been praying to play football.

0:13:36.120,0:13:38.700
But you have not played football.

0:13:38.700,0:13:42.960
But we are telling you, "This is the outcome of the game";

0:13:42.960,0:13:45.220
that you are a winner.

0:13:45.220,0:13:51.760
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:13:51.760,0:13:53.900
The way out for you...

0:13:53.900,0:13:55.600
[...has come.]

0:13:55.600,0:13:57.600
I want you to finish the word.

0:13:57.600,0:14:00.620
[The way out for me has come.]

0:14:00.620,0:14:04.220
The way out for your business has come!

0:14:04.220,0:14:07.720
The way out for your health has come!

0:14:07.720,0:14:13.980
The way out for your marriage, career has come!

0:14:13.980,0:14:16.500
What else, if I'm telling you.

0:14:16.500,0:14:24.740
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:14:24.740,0:14:35.280
If you are praying to God, "Lord, please, this man promised to borrow me millions of dollars",

0:14:35.280,0:14:40.680
and you prayed that the Lord should touch his heart and you have been praying since morning,

0:14:40.680,0:14:44.560
will the man come inside the church to give you the loan?

0:14:44.560,0:14:48.620
And I'm telling you now that when you get home, the man is waiting to give you a loan.

0:14:48.620,0:14:55.820
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:14:55.820,0:15:01.200
So this is just the picture of what I'm painting.

0:15:01.200,0:15:07.320
Concerning your health, that pain - you feel that pain.

0:15:07.320,0:15:13.980
You are telling me something in the natural and I'm telling you something in the spirit.

0:15:13.980,0:15:21.880
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:15:21.880,0:15:36.620
I can see God's deliverance touching you!

0:15:36.620,0:15:44.680
I can see God's deliverance touching your finances!

0:15:44.680,0:15:55.000
I can see God's deliverance touching your finances, in the name of Jesus Christ!

0:15:55.000,0:16:06.740
I am not coming here to pray; I am here to prophesy.

0:16:06.740,0:16:12.340
What I have seen in the spirit is what I am telling you now.

0:16:12.340,0:16:29.420
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:16:29.420,0:16:43.460
Tell your neighbour, "Be patient and wait for the physical manifestation now!"

0:16:43.460,0:16:49.540
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:16:49.540,0:17:00.600
Take note of 'now'! I'm not saying just be patient; wait for the physical manifestation now!

0:17:00.600,0:17:08.960
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:17:08.960,0:17:15.100
This year, 1st January, the Lord said, "Go to the mountain. Meet me somewhere".

0:17:15.100,0:17:16.560
I said, "Which mountain?"

0:17:16.560,0:17:18.580
The Lord said, "A quiet place.

0:17:18.580,0:17:24.300
A place where when I'm praying, I will not be able to close my eyes because of fear.

0:17:24.300,0:17:28.220
Tiger can come this way, lion may come this way,

0:17:28.220,0:17:32.660
python may come this way. Inside the thick forest".

0:17:32.660,0:17:35.000
Where I will not be able to close my eyes.

0:17:35.000,0:17:40.840
You yourself - it is your idea and culture that when you want to pray...

0:17:40.840,0:17:47.640
If I carry you to where I went to last January - ah!

0:17:47.640,0:17:55.100
Even you would not want to pray louder because you don't know what is coming out.

0:17:55.100,0:18:07.080
When I got there, the second day, the Lord said to me, "This year is very fearful".

0:18:07.080,0:18:09.520
"This year is a very fearful year?"

0:18:09.520,0:18:16.680
"I'm bringing you here to pray for your nation and for the whole world at large and for your people."

0:18:16.680,0:18:19.460
"How will I offer the prayer?"

0:18:19.460,0:18:26.400
"Stay here for three days. I will give you a word to say."

0:18:26.400,0:18:30.120
I am just telling you what is in the spirit.

0:18:30.120,0:18:38.060
If care is not taken - proper care - it may hang for years.

0:18:38.060,0:18:42.200
Do you know that many are here that are not supposed to be a follower,

0:18:42.200,0:18:47.340
are supposed to be a leader and their leadership has been released in the spirit

0:18:47.340,0:18:50.760
but yet, they are still a follower.

0:18:50.760,0:18:54.840
Something can be hung for many years in the spirit

0:18:54.840,0:18:57.700
which is no longer in the hands of God.

0:18:57.700,0:19:03.840
God will release - "Ok, this thing is for Mr T.B. Joshua."

0:19:03.840,0:19:07.640
And it will continue rolling and rolling in the spirit there.

0:19:07.640,0:19:11.880
And yet, for years, T.B. Joshua has not yet received it.

0:19:11.880,0:19:14.620
And you will continue to pray to God, "God, give me bread, give me bread",

0:19:14.620,0:19:17.720
whereas that bread has been released over there.

0:19:17.720,0:19:23.080
But the bread you were to have received instantly is just there

0:19:23.080,0:19:29.080
because what you do is different from what you say.

0:19:29.080,0:19:31.080
So the thing will just be there.

0:19:31.080,0:19:35.160
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:19:35.160,0:19:38.660
Sometimes, when I see people on the street and I look at them,

0:19:38.660,0:19:41.420
"This man is not supposed to be on the street.

0:19:41.420,0:19:44.920
He is supposed to be in the palace.

0:19:44.920,0:19:50.060
Ah, this man is supposed to be in the palace but he is on the street".

0:19:50.060,0:19:54.380
Sometimes I see people lamenting, crying

0:19:54.380,0:19:58.100
whereas when I look at the person that is crying and lamenting,

0:19:58.100,0:20:06.360
this is a crown; somebody who is supposed to wear a crown.

0:20:06.360,0:20:13.500
One of the best men in the world is now on the street - one of worst men in the world.

0:20:13.500,0:20:23.320
On the last day, you will now find out, "This is the life I lived. This is the life God designed for me".

0:20:23.320,0:20:31.480
Tell your neighbour, "I am what I do, not what I say".

0:20:31.480,0:20:33.120
I can't hear you.

0:20:33.120,0:20:37.360
[I am what I do, not what I say.]

0:20:37.360,0:20:41.020
I am what I do, not what I say.

0:20:41.020,0:20:47.420
Match your actions with your words.

0:20:47.420,0:20:53.520
That is why when we say, "In Jesus' name", we are talking to the air.

0:20:53.520,0:20:57.700
If you are what you say, anytime you say, "In Jesus' name",

0:20:57.700,0:21:00.440
Jesus will come to the scene.

0:21:00.440,0:21:04.360
But many times you say, "In Jesus' name", Jesus does not come to the scene

0:21:04.360,0:21:08.060
because you are what you do

0:21:08.060,0:21:11.600
Think about that.

0:21:11.600,0:21:16.820
Knowing facts about Jesus does not change your relationship with Him.

0:21:16.820,0:21:29.940
Tell your neighbour, "Knowing facts about Jesus does not change my relationship with Jesus".

0:21:29.940,0:21:31.160
Listen to me.

0:21:31.160,0:21:49.560
I can see God's deliverance touching you - touching your life, touching your career.

0:21:49.560,0:21:58.480
Somebody touched me

0:21:58.480,0:22:08.300
Somebody touched my soul

0:22:08.300,0:22:18.900
While I was praying
Praying to my Father

0:22:18.900,0:22:29.340
Somebody touched my soul

0:22:29.340,0:22:39.920
Somebody touched me

0:22:39.920,0:22:50.780
Somebody touched my soul

0:22:50.780,0:23:01.640
While I was praying
Praying to my Father

0:23:01.640,0:23:09.800
Somebody touched my soul

0:23:09.800,0:23:12.120
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:23:12.120,0:23:23.600
It must be Jesus

0:23:23.600,0:23:35.720
Jesus Christ touched my soul

0:23:35.720,0:23:47.300
While I was praying
Praying to my Father

0:23:47.300,0:23:55.740
Jesus Christ touched my soul

0:23:55.740,0:24:02.780
I can see God's healing touching you, in the name of Jesus!

0:24:02.780,0:24:08.000
I am telling you what I am seeing in the spirit.

0:24:08.000,0:24:16.300
Allow it to happen.

0:24:16.300,0:24:25.840
I can see God's healing touching your life!

0:24:25.840,0:24:42.880
Allow it to happen, in the name of Jesus!

0:24:42.880,0:25:07.940
Tell your neighbour, "Be patient and wait for the physical manifestation now, in the name of Jesus!"

0:25:07.940,0:25:12.300
Recount again.

0:25:12.300,0:25:17.520
I can see God's deliverance touching your life.

0:25:17.520,0:25:19.980
I recount again.

0:25:19.980,0:25:24.700
I can see God's deliverance touching your business.

0:25:24.700,0:25:27.260
I recount again.

0:25:27.260,0:25:37.860
I can see God's deliverance touching your marriage, in the name of Jesus!

0:25:37.860,0:25:41.060
The way out for you has come!

0:25:41.060,0:25:42.400
I can't hear you.

0:25:42.400,0:25:43.720
[Amen!]

0:25:43.720,0:25:44.920
I can't hear you.

0:25:44.920,0:25:45.940
[Amen!]

0:25:45.940,0:25:47.180
I can't hear you.

0:25:47.180,0:25:48.180
[Amen!]

0:25:48.180,0:25:49.420
I can't hear you.

0:25:49.420,0:25:50.160
[Amen!]

0:25:50.160,0:25:51.580
I can't hear you.

0:25:51.580,0:25:52.780
[Amen!]

0:25:52.780,0:25:58.820
Say to yourself, "The way out for me has come!"

0:25:58.820,0:26:00.140
I can't hear you.

0:26:00.140,0:26:02.420
[The way out for me has come!]

0:26:02.420,0:26:06.040
The way out for your career has come!

0:26:06.040,0:26:11.160

The way out for my marriage has come, in Jesus' name!

0:26:29.280,0:26:31.960
Rejoice!

0:26:31.960,0:26:38.420
The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

0:26:38.420,0:26:41.360
This is my message to you.

0:26:41.360,0:26:43.780
You should allow it to happen.

0:26:43.780,0:26:55.920
You have a role to play to allow it to happen.

0:26:55.920,0:26:58.880
You should allow it to happen.

0:26:58.880,0:27:05.380
Don't forget.

0:27:05.380,0:27:21.060
Don't harbour unforgiving spirit; don't harbour grudges.

0:27:21.060,0:27:32.600
Holding offence grieves the Holy Spirit.

0:27:32.600,0:27:35.200
Thank You, Lord!

0:27:35.200,0:27:38.240
In Jesus' name.

0:27:38.240,0:27:40.800
Lift up your voice and let us pray for your nation.

0:27:40.800,0:27:48.040
Whatever you have as a contact, contact point, let us pray for your nation.

0:27:48.040,0:28:03.040
God's intervention!

0:28:03.040,0:28:09.600
God's intervention, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:28:09.600,0:28:11.020

0:28:13.400,0:28:15.400
[Amen!]

0:28:15.400,0:28:18.100
Thank You, Lord!

0:28:18.100,0:28:26.260
Let us pray for nations that are not at peace because of war, crises.

0:28:26.260,0:28:33.100
Wherever that nation is - all over the world - send your prayer of peace.

0:28:33.100,0:28:34.880
Lift up your voice and pray.

0:28:34.880,0:28:41.620
Ask God to rain the rain of peace, rain of harmony on nations.

0:28:41.620,0:28:47.440
Wherever - East, South, North continent, South Continent.

Prayer For The Nations
With Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:28:54.760,0:28:58.800
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:28:58.800,0:29:03.020
Let us pray for your journey.

0:29:03.020,0:29:06.780
Your journey of righteousness is not yet over.

0:29:06.780,0:29:11.900
You need to live the rest of your life to maintain your holiness.

0:29:11.900,0:29:18.060
Jesus will come like a thief in the night - no one knows when and how.

0:29:18.060,0:29:26.180
Therefore, you have to be alert, be conscious of what you do and what you say.

0:29:26.180,0:29:29.900
"Ah, am I saying what God wants me to say?"

0:29:29.900,0:29:32.020
"Am I doing what God wants me to do?"

0:29:32.020,0:29:36.300
Don't go where Jesus is not invited.

0:29:36.300,0:29:40.000
Be conscious of what you do, what you say.

0:29:40.000,0:29:41.520
Prayer.

0:29:41.520,0:29:43.360
Ask God to strengthen you.

0:29:43.360,0:29:56.700
Ask for the grace of God to cover to you, His strength from day to day,

0:29:56.700,0:30:00.400
in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

0:30:00.400,0:30:01.960
I can't hear you.

0:30:01.960,0:30:03.680
[Amen!]

0:30:03.680,0:30:05.800
Hallelujah.

0:30:05.800,0:30:08.300
God's intervention.

0:30:08.300,0:30:13.300
Right now, I pray you become God's channel from today -

0:30:13.300,0:30:17.480
a channel of light where there is darkness,

0:30:17.480,0:30:20.900
a channel of love where there is hate,

0:30:20.900,0:30:24.740
a channel of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness,

0:30:24.740,0:30:28.880
a channel of obedience where there is disobedience,

0:30:28.880,0:30:35.480
a channel of humility where there is pride, in Jesus Christ's name.

0:30:35.480,0:30:36.760
I can't hear you.

0:30:36.760,0:30:38.540
[Amen!]

0:30:38.540,0:30:40.000
Thank You, Lord.
