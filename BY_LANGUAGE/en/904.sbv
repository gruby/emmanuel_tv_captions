0:00:00.000,0:00:08.580
Thank you.
You may be seated.

0:00:08.580,0:00:10.600
Hallelujah!

0:00:10.600,0:00:13.700
Good morning!

0:00:13.700,0:00:18.340
I'm joining you in the same atmosphere.

0:00:18.340,0:00:25.400
God's Word has the ability to quicken us spiritually.

0:00:25.400,0:00:27.980
Tell your neighbour, "God's Word has ability".

0:00:27.980,0:00:30.380
[God's Word has ability]

0:00:30.380,0:00:35.740
Ability to quicken us spiritually.

0:00:35.740,0:00:39.020
God's Word is Spirit.

0:00:39.020,0:00:42.800
Because it is Spirit, that is why it has that enablement.

0:00:42.800,0:00:45.680
It is not just a matter of...

0:00:45.680,0:00:50.040
No, it is beyond that.

0:00:50.040,0:00:53.120
When you speak it, it goes.

0:00:53.120,0:00:55.560
It cannot stay in your lips.

0:00:55.560,0:00:58.040
It goes and does things.

0:00:58.040,0:01:09.480
You say, "Let there be light!" - you see the light, because it has ability to quicken us spiritually.

0:01:09.480,0:01:16.560
Let's quickly look at the book of John 6.

0:01:16.560,0:01:19.100
Let's quickly look at the verse 63 there.

0:01:19.100,0:01:28.200
It says, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing."

0:01:28.200,0:01:33.340
The Spirit gives life and the flesh counts for what?

0:01:33.340,0:01:34.480
For nothing!

0:01:34.480,0:01:40.340
The words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit.

0:01:40.340,0:01:49.560
This means the Word of God has the ability to quicken us spiritually.

0:01:49.560,0:02:11.000
The Word of God is a Spirit that has the ability to develop a spiritual force within our hearts called faith.

0:02:11.000,0:02:16.420
"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing."

0:02:16.420,0:02:21.940
This means the Spirit gives being, the flesh counts for nothing.

0:02:21.940,0:02:29.660
"The words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life." John 6:63.

0:02:29.660,0:02:34.080
This means the Word of God is not just words.

0:02:34.080,0:02:40.260
There is Bible language and the language of today.

0:02:40.260,0:02:57.800
The Word of God, a Spirit has the ability to develop a spiritual force within our hearts called faith.

0:02:57.800,0:03:05.040
What we call faith is something that develops within our hearts.

0:03:05.040,0:03:09.200
Take note of that; it is not just "faith in faith, faith in this or that".

0:03:09.200,0:03:14.540
We talk of faith in the Word of God, faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

0:03:14.540,0:03:19.220
What we call faith in Jesus, faith in the finished works of our Lord, Jesus Christ

0:03:19.220,0:03:26.800
is something that develops within our hearts.

0:03:26.800,0:03:28.340
What we call faith...

0:03:28.340,0:03:33.780
Because there are faiths in faith, faith in this or that, faith in yourself...

0:03:33.780,0:03:41.440
We use the word "faith" like a literal word - no - there is more to that.

0:03:41.440,0:03:46.500
You say, "I will do the job by faith" - no, that is not the faith we are talking about here.

0:03:46.500,0:03:52.420
"By faith it will go, it will work..." - no, that is not the kind of faith we are talking about.

0:03:52.420,0:03:59.520
What we call, "Bible faith" is something that develops within our hearts -

0:03:59.520,0:04:05.720
a spiritual force that develops within our hearts.

0:04:05.720,0:04:07.940
How does this develop?

0:04:07.940,0:04:20.640
If you pay attention to God's Word, I mean, if you pay attention to God,

0:04:20.640,0:04:35.500
you will find that faith comes spontaneously, naturally.

0:04:35.500,0:04:47.240
If you pay attention - not this kind of attention Attention!...

0:04:47.240,0:04:52.040
The attention I'm talking about is attention with all your heart.

0:04:52.040,0:04:56.320
If you pay attention to God's Word…

0:04:56.320,0:04:57.640
How do pay attention?

0:04:57.640,0:05:19.340
By looking at God, looking on God, and meditating on the Word.

0:05:19.340,0:05:22.560
How do we meditate on the Word?

0:05:22.560,0:05:33.540
If I say, "The more you think..." I'm talking of mediation - it is more than thinking.

0:05:33.540,0:05:41.320
When I say, "The more you think..." it is no longer on your situation - on God.

0:05:41.320,0:05:48.600
The more you think about what you read, what you see around, what you hear,

0:05:48.600,0:05:55.020
the more you become familiar with His voice.

0:05:55.020,0:05:56.360
Take note of that.

0:05:56.360,0:06:02.840
When I say, "The more you think..." I mean meditation.

0:06:02.840,0:06:05.080
The more you think - I am talking of meditation.

0:06:05.080,0:06:11.720
Before you can get to meditation you must get through "think, think, think..."

0:06:11.720,0:06:18.520
That is meditation - "think, think, think..."

0:06:18.520,0:06:29.700
Not think - situation, more think - it is no longer your situation - on God.

0:06:29.700,0:06:42.820
Faith comes spontaneously, that is, naturally.

0:06:42.820,0:06:50.160
This is why you cannot have faith when you read your Bible the way you read literature.

0:06:50.160,0:06:56.160
When you read your Bible the way you read chemistry or physics, you cannot have faith

0:06:56.160,0:07:02.700
because faith comes spontaneously.

0:07:02.700,0:07:09.520
This is why you cannot have faith when you commit what you read to memory.

0:07:09.520,0:07:13.400
You memorise your Bible.

0:07:13.400,0:07:23.780
It is good to memorise, it is valuable but it must be an integral part of you.

0:07:23.780,0:07:28.180
It is good to memorise.

0:07:28.180,0:07:34.560
When you memorise the Bible, it is like storing water in your mouth.

0:07:34.560,0:07:45.940
When you want to drink and you store the water in your mouth without swallowing it, it's a waste.

0:07:45.940,0:07:51.920
If water remains in your mouth without swallowing it, it is a waste.

0:07:51.920,0:07:58.300
In the same vein, when you memorise the Bible without allowing this to be part of you,

0:07:58.300,0:08:02.680
to be an integral part of you, it is a waste.

0:08:02.680,0:08:05.620
You read your Bible, you begin to memorise the verses.

0:08:05.620,0:08:14.220
We memorise our Bible to preach, teach it, not to live it.

0:08:14.220,0:08:22.180
To live the Bible is to allow this to be an integral part of us.

0:08:22.180,0:08:29.540
Faith originates from God.

0:08:29.540,0:08:31.660
It originates from who?

0:08:31.660,0:08:32.580
[God.]

0:08:32.580,0:08:34.840
God.

0:08:34.840,0:08:39.880
It does not originate from ourselves.

0:08:39.880,0:08:47.600
This is why when you look around, at yourself, everywhere; you cannot find faith.

0:08:47.600,0:08:54.540
You look around, at yourself; you cannot find faith.

0:08:54.540,0:09:00.740
Once you realise that God is reliable, faith comes.

0:09:00.740,0:09:07.760
Ah! God is great!
It brings faith.

0:09:07.760,0:09:09.580
A "slot of faith".

0:09:09.580,0:09:16.660
Oh, how did this happen?
Oh, God is great!

0:09:16.660,0:09:25.040
It means God is reliable - He gives you a slot of faith.

0:09:25.040,0:09:30.520
You begin to develop that faith and it begins to grow more.

0:09:30.520,0:09:38.800
Another time; "Oh, I am healed. Glory be to God! It can only be God."

0:09:38.800,0:09:40.800
Another plot of faith.

0:09:40.800,0:09:43.600
Your faith is growing gradually.

0:09:43.600,0:09:46.180
It comes spontaneously.

0:09:46.180,0:09:54.160
This is why the theologians, many authors writing about the Bible - they have no faith.

0:09:54.160,0:09:58.860
Authors of many books about the Bible don't have faith.

0:09:58.860,0:10:07.780
They are well educated, they are authors but they have no faith.

0:10:07.780,0:10:13.240
That you have a Bible does not mean you have faith.

0:10:13.240,0:10:19.400
That you are a Christian, as you claim, does not mean you have faith.

0:10:19.400,0:10:24.960
That you are a bishop, prophet, does not mean you have faith.

0:10:24.960,0:10:31.620
That you know Jesus does not mean you have faith until Jesus knows you.

0:10:31.620,0:10:43.580
Tell your neighbour, "That you know Jesus does not mean you have faith in Jesus until Jesus knows you."

0:10:43.580,0:10:53.980
Yes, that you know Jesus, you preach Jesus and people can see you are a good preacher;

0:10:53.980,0:10:57.140
it does not mean you have faith.

0:10:57.140,0:11:01.220
... until Jesus knows you.

0:11:01.220,0:11:11.160
Jesus can only know us by His faith, not by our faith; by His obedience, not by our obedience;

0:11:11.160,0:11:14.480
by His humility, not by our humility.

0:11:14.480,0:11:19.840
You see people that are very humble and simple, but it is not of God.

0:11:19.840,0:11:30.060
You can see people that are very faithful to you, but not of God.

0:11:30.060,0:11:39.020
People can be very obedient, to you - yeah, he is an obedient child - but not of God.

0:11:39.020,0:11:46.120
The Bible said it, "These I have given you, not as the world gives them".

0:11:46.120,0:11:53.760
Everything Jesus has given, the world can also give the same but with conditions.

0:11:53.760,0:11:59.220
If you don't look at it very well you may not know the difference.

0:11:59.220,0:12:04.460
This is why today we don't know the difference between this and that.

0:12:04.460,0:12:09.380
When it comes to things of the Spirit, we are ignorant.

0:12:09.380,0:12:16.960
"These I have given you, not as the world gives them" it means all Jesus is giving out,

0:12:16.960,0:12:25.880
the world can give also, but with a difference.

0:12:25.880,0:12:27.020
What is the difference?

0:12:27.020,0:12:32.020
The difference is the end.

0:12:32.020,0:12:42.060
Beginnings may look similar, the middles may look similar, but the end is always different.

0:12:42.060,0:12:45.860
The end proves the difference.

0:12:45.860,0:12:53.840
The beginning looks| similar, you may ignorantly not know the difference.

0:12:53.840,0:13:01.500
The middle - at the same time you may ignorantly not know the difference, because we are desperate.

0:13:01.500,0:13:04.660
Because of our desperation we don't know the difference.

0:13:04.660,0:13:12.060
Desperate to be this, that, to get there - we don't mind how it comes, how it looks,

0:13:12.060,0:13:15.760
since he gave you the same thing.

0:13:15.760,0:13:21.180
If the end of what you are doing is not going to be good - it has no meaning.

0:13:21.180,0:13:25.720
It is better not to do it at all.

0:13:25.720,0:13:29.540
We have seen the end of many.

0:13:29.540,0:13:43.020
Beginning - flourish, middle seems to flourish, but the end - crying, lamenting, sorrow.

0:13:43.020,0:13:51.820
Our end should not end when we pass on to glory.

0:13:51.820,0:13:57.240
Our work should not end when we end the journey.

0:13:57.240,0:13:59.640
If not, no one will remember you.

0:13:59.640,0:14:05.920
You are living, but the children yet unborn to remember that someone lived before...

0:14:05.920,0:14:14.000
But when there is no record once the journey ends - of what value...?

0:14:14.000,0:14:23.360
If all the effort of the apostles ended at their time, people like me would not be here today.

0:14:23.360,0:14:26.340
They paid the supreme price to bring the Gospel.

0:14:26.340,0:14:31.380
Because the Gospel did not end at their time, at the end of they journey -

0:14:31.380,0:14:37.640
this is why people like me are still here today to preach the Gospel.

0:14:37.640,0:14:49.240
What are you doing that makes you sure and believe that it will not end when your journey ends?

0:14:49.240,0:14:50.220
What are you doing?

0:14:50.220,0:14:58.880
Ask your neighbour, "What are you doing now that will not end when your journey ends?"

0:14:58.880,0:15:01.340
What are you doing?

0:15:01.340,0:15:10.340
Ask your neighbour, " What are you doing that children yet unborn will live to see?"

0:15:10.340,0:15:12.000
Ask your neighbour again.

0:15:12.000,0:15:16.940
[What are you doing that children yet unborn will live to see?]

0:15:16.940,0:15:21.480
That is the question for you to answer.

0:15:21.480,0:15:29.280
What are you doing that children yet unborn will live to see when you end your journey?

0:15:29.280,0:15:34.700
Just like in case of apostles - we are children yet unborn at their time.

0:15:34.700,0:15:40.900
Today we are seen, we are enjoying the price they paid.

0:15:40.900,0:15:45.340
The word "faith" led us to this.

0:15:45.340,0:15:48.520
Faith comes spontaneously.

0:15:48.520,0:15:57.140
It is not the work of reading, righteousness, sweating or whatever you have done

0:15:57.140,0:16:02.040
that brings faith – it comes spontaneously, naturally.

0:16:02.040,0:16:12.940
This is why you cannot receive that faith when you read your Bible the way you read literature.

0:16:12.940,0:16:21.080
This is why it is difficult for someone to acquire faith after finishing theology school.

0:16:21.080,0:16:24.780
It is very difficult.

0:16:24.780,0:16:31.620
You acquire that knowledge, but that faith is always difficult to acquire.

0:16:31.620,0:16:39.440
When you read your Bible the way you read literature you cannot acquire the faith we are talking about.

0:16:39.440,0:16:50.120
Because, like I have said, what we call faith is something that has an ability

0:16:50.120,0:16:55.840
to develop a spiritual force within our hearts.

0:16:55.840,0:16:57.920
It is beyond ordinary reading.

0:16:57.920,0:17:01.160
It must be reading with devotion.

0:17:01.160,0:17:03.240
It must be reading with what?

0:17:03.240,0:17:04.060
[Devotion.]

0:17:04.060,0:17:04.900
With devotion.

0:17:04.900,0:17:14.860
Tell your neighbour, "It is beyond ordinary reading – it must be reading with devotion."

0:17:14.860,0:17:16.740
Quality time is what we call.

0:17:16.740,0:17:22.000
When I say read something with devotion it means read it in your quality time.

0:17:22.000,0:17:24.120
In a good time, not in a waste time.

0:17:24.120,0:17:31.780
You know we read our Bible at the waste time, when we don't have anything to do, in the time we don't value,

0:17:31.780,0:17:34.180
when we are tired.

0:17:34.180,0:17:44.540
But the Bible must be read in the quality time, your best time, cherished time, not in the time you are tired,

0:17:44.540,0:17:50.180
when you don't have anything else to do, you are about to sleep - no!

0:17:50.180,0:17:55.280
So that - your spirit can be at its best.

0:17:55.280,0:18:01.160
When your spirit is not at its best and you are reading your Bible, you are wasting your time.

0:18:01.160,0:18:03.800
Your spirit must be at its best

0:18:03.800,0:18:11.360
because when your spirit is not at its best, you cannot meditate; you can only think.

0:18:11.360,0:18:14.880
We think when our spirit is not at its best.

0:18:14.880,0:18:19.620
We meditate when our spirit is at its best.

0:18:19.620,0:18:25.440
Do you understand the word, "spirit being at its best"?

0:18:25.440,0:18:27.800
When there is no burden.

0:18:27.800,0:18:36.840
You know, when there is so much burden on us you are worried - so much burden.

0:18:36.840,0:18:40.400
Weight on your spirit.

0:18:40.400,0:18:45.480
If your spirit is not at its best, it cannot attract the Spirit of God.

0:18:45.480,0:18:50.280
If your spirit is not at its best, it cannot attract what?

0:18:50.280,0:18:51.360
[Spirit of God.]

0:18:51.360,0:18:53.840
It cannot attract the Spirit of God.

0:18:53.840,0:18:57.300
Your spirit must be at its best to attract the Spirit of God.

0:18:57.300,0:19:01.080
That is, when your spirit is free.

0:19:01.080,0:19:02.280
That is what I mean.

0:19:02.280,0:19:06.640
For our spirit to be at its best means to be free - free spirit.

0:19:06.640,0:19:09.780
When you don't think of anything you are relaxed.

0:19:09.780,0:19:12.540
You just look at yourself and smile.

0:19:12.540,0:19:15.280
Not looking at yourself and crying.

0:19:15.280,0:19:18.800
You know, oftentimes you look at yourself and cry.

0:19:18.800,0:19:26.540
You may not necessarily cry but you feel so disgusting - you hate yourself.

0:19:26.540,0:19:28.720
Free spirit, let someone say, "Free spirit".

0:19:28.720,0:19:29.520
[Free spirit.]

0:19:29.520,0:19:30.620
I cannot hear you.

0:19:30.620,0:19:31.380
[Free spirit.]

0:19:31.380,0:19:32.440
I cannot hear you.

0:19:32.440,0:19:33.140
[Free spirit.]

0:19:33.140,0:19:34.160
I cannot hear you.

0:19:34.160,0:19:34.900
[Free spirit.]

0:19:34.900,0:19:35.840
I cannot hear you.

0:19:35.840,0:19:36.740
[Free spirit.]

0:19:36.740,0:19:40.480
Can you tell me how often you have a free spirit?

0:19:40.480,0:19:43.520
Have you actually had a free spirit ever before?

0:19:43.520,0:19:51.160
Because it id difficult; you have so much to think about.

0:19:51.160,0:19:57.620
You can only have a free spirit when you start your thinking by this:

0:19:57.620,0:20:02.320
"If today is my last day on earth, what else?"

0:20:02.320,0:20:04.820
Start your thinking from there.

0:20:04.820,0:20:09.480
Start your thinking from where?

0:20:09.480,0:20:14.880
To have a free spirit you must start your thinking this way:

0:20:14.880,0:20:22.780
"If today is my last day on this earth, what  would they remember me for?"

0:20:22.780,0:20:32.000
Once you start your thinking like that, you find yourself thinking the more...

0:20:32.000,0:20:36.340
now meditation comes.

0:20:36.340,0:20:43.100
Thinking about it alone will make you forget your situation.

0:20:43.100,0:20:52.540
When you come to that understanding, "if today is your last day on earth, what else?",

0:20:52.540,0:20:56.480
you will soon understand what free spirit means.

0:20:56.480,0:21:02.020
You need free spirit to have faith.

0:21:02.020,0:21:14.200
When your spirit is at its best, you are smelling the faith of God.

0:21:14.200,0:21:23.720
When your spirit is at its best, it means free spirit; then, you can attract the Spirit of God.

0:21:23.720,0:21:29.540
He joins Himself to our spirit to declare us children of God.

0:21:29.540,0:21:35.340
He joins Himself to our spirit to heal and deliver us.

0:21:35.340,0:21:39.800
"Ha! I'm sick. In Jesus' name - be healed", and you are healed.

0:21:39.800,0:21:44.040
It means that the Spirit of God joined Himself to your spirit to heal you.

0:21:44.040,0:21:49.420
For the Spirit to join Himself to your spirit, your spirit must be free

0:21:49.420,0:21:53.480
and when it's free, then it attracts the Spirit of God.

0:21:53.480,0:22:00.860
But when it is not free and is in bondage, trouble - then it attracts the evil spirits.

0:22:00.860,0:22:03.700
Tell your neighbour, "Will you allow free spirit?"

0:22:03.700,0:22:06.120
[Will you allow free spirit?]

0:22:06.120,0:22:07.820
It is your duty to do that.

0:22:07.820,0:22:10.080
Jesus will not come to do that for you.

0:22:10.080,0:22:13.300
It is your role to do that before the Spirit of God comes.

0:22:13.300,0:22:15.720
Jesus will not come to give you a free spirit.

0:22:15.720,0:22:18.560
It is your duty to allow this.

0:22:18.560,0:22:21.180
You just have to put everything behind you.

0:22:21.180,0:22:25.700
Let your past pass and move forward.

0:22:25.700,0:22:30.800
Know that there is no one without limitations.

0:22:30.800,0:22:33.960
If you say you have a problem - there is no one without limitation.

0:22:33.960,0:22:38.200
You may have problem, you may have sickness - other people have other problems.

0:22:38.200,0:22:47.240
There is no one on this earth, including even T.B. Joshua - no one without limitation.

0:22:47.240,0:22:53.840
When you know there is no one without limitation, you allow a free spirit.

0:22:53.840,0:22:55.900
There is no one without limitation.

0:22:55.900,0:22:57.140
Tell your neighbour.

0:22:57.140,0:22:59.180
[There is no one without limitation.]

0:22:59.180,0:23:00.280
I cannot hear you.

0:23:00.280,0:23:02.120
[There is no one without limitation.]

0:23:02.120,0:23:03.340
I cannot hear you.

0:23:03.340,0:23:05.720
[There is no one without limitation.]

0:23:05.720,0:23:07.000
Yes.

0:23:07.000,0:23:18.980
This limitation makes our journey more valuable, more interesting.

0:23:18.980,0:23:24.300
Limitation makes our Christian life more interesting, more valuable.

0:23:24.300,0:23:29.800
"I am a Christian without limitation" - you are not a Christian.

0:23:29.800,0:23:34.520
Limitation will continue to draw you closer to God.

0:23:34.520,0:23:39.200
Fast the more, pray the more, seek His face the more.

0:23:39.200,0:23:43.160
Limitation makes us pay attention to God.

0:23:43.160,0:23:49.580
Tell your neighbour, "My limitation makes me pay attention to God."

0:23:49.580,0:23:55.140
The more I pray, the more I seek His face.

0:23:55.140,0:23:58.560
Without limitation there is no need for attention.

0:23:58.560,0:24:00.300
What brought you here today?

0:24:00.300,0:24:09.580
I'm very sure your coming here is not out of comfort, out of pleasure, out of abundant blessing.

0:24:09.580,0:24:15.800
Without limitation your faith is no real faith.

0:24:15.800,0:24:23.460
Tell your neighbour, "Without limitation, my faith is no real faith."

0:24:23.460,0:24:26.040
Faith works on limitations.

0:24:26.040,0:24:32.260
Limitation makes our faith more valuable.

0:24:32.260,0:24:33.280
What is your limitation?

0:24:33.280,0:24:34.600
Ask your neighbour.

0:24:34.600,0:24:35.920
[What is your limitation?]

0:24:35.920,0:24:37.200
Ask your neighbour.

0:24:37.200,0:24:38.640
[What is your limitation?]

0:24:38.640,0:24:42.140
You can be kind enough to tell your neighbour your limitation.

0:24:42.140,0:24:44.740
Can you be kind enough?

0:24:44.740,0:24:50.820
Can you be kind enough to tell your neighbour your limitation?

0:24:50.820,0:24:54.600
Tell your neighbour, "Can you be kind enough to tell me your limitation?"

0:24:54.600,0:25:06.320
[Can you be kind enough to tell me your limitation?]

0:25:06.320,0:25:13.460
Let me tell you; if any of your neighbours tells you his own limitations - that is not limitation.

0:25:13.460,0:25:19.720
Limitation is something you would never discuss with anyone.

0:25:19.720,0:25:24.340
When you tell your neighbour, "This is my limitation" - this is not a limitation, it is your situation.

0:25:24.340,0:25:32.280
If anybody is telling you his limitation; he is not telling you his limitation but his situation.

0:25:32.280,0:25:35.520
Limitation is something that...

0:25:35.520,0:25:44.140
When you are praying to God to remove that limitations, you would be looking around.

0:25:44.140,0:25:51.500
When somebody knocks the door... "Hosanna".

0:25:51.500,0:25:59.020
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:25:59.020,0:26:03.120
Can you be kind enough and tell me your limitation?

0:26:03.120,0:26:06.860
You will tell me your situation.

0:26:06.860,0:26:16.940
Limitation is what actually limits you from eating with Jesus on the table,

0:26:16.940,0:26:23.520
from kissing Jesus, you can kiss Him, from understanding His voice.

0:26:23.520,0:26:24.760
You don't understand His voice.

0:26:24.760,0:26:28.420
When you dream you don't know whether it is a real dream or a nightmare.

0:26:28.420,0:26:31.400
We don't understand His voice.

0:26:31.400,0:26:33.880
We are not familiar with His voice.

0:26:33.880,0:26:42.160
If you are familiar with God's voice, you know when satan is talking and when God is talking.

0:26:42.160,0:26:44.600
Voices are always in your heart.

0:26:44.600,0:26:57.200
You know, I say, faith has ability to develop a spiritual force within our hearts.

0:26:57.200,0:27:06.220
Like you are listening to me now - the word will continue to develop a force within your heart.

0:27:06.220,0:27:11.300
You will find yourself being transformed.

0:27:11.300,0:27:12.860
That is faith.

0:27:12.860,0:27:21.240
It has ability to develop a spiritual force within our heart, called faith.

0:27:21.240,0:27:22.000
There is more.

0:27:22.000,0:27:26.340
When the Bible says, "Faith comes by hearing the Word of God",

0:27:26.340,0:27:29.480
it does not end be saying, "Faith comes by hearing".

0:27:29.480,0:27:36.420
To hear the Word of Faith, one must pay attention.

0:27:36.420,0:27:53.220
To pay attention is to look at God, look on God and meditate on the Word.

0:27:53.220,0:27:55.900
How can we look at God?

0:27:55.900,0:28:08.360
When you are listening to the ministers of God, all attention, with all your hearts, you have to pray along.

0:28:08.360,0:28:12.220
Like you are looking at me - you have to pray along to understand.

0:28:12.220,0:28:24.600
It is not just looking at me to understand, you have to begin to pray along, "God, give me a hearing heart.

0:28:24.600,0:28:27.840
Lord Jesus, give me a hearing heart".

0:28:27.840,0:28:34.200
While you listen to the word, "Give me a hearing heart".

0:28:34.200,0:28:41.420
When the minister of God is preaching or you are at home listening to the Christian channel you say,

0:28:41.420,0:28:46.800
"Lord, give me a hearing heart".

0:28:46.800,0:28:51.040
Because what you hear must go to your heart.

0:28:51.040,0:29:00.140
Because the word of Faith you hear is a spiritual force within your heart.

0:29:00.140,0:29:01.920
A hearing heart.

0:29:01.920,0:29:07.480
When you pray along like that, when you listen to the word, you have a breakthrough.

0:29:07.480,0:29:10.140
It comes spontaneously, it just comes.

0:29:10.140,0:29:13.620
Because this very body cannot hear the word of Faith.

0:29:13.620,0:29:18.180
There is so much to think about.

0:29:18.180,0:29:23.480
Burden - our spirit, our heart is in prison.

0:29:23.480,0:29:29.380
You need a free spirit to hear the Word of Faith.

0:29:29.380,0:29:32.760
"Give me a hearing heart."

0:29:32.760,0:29:35.100
That should be your prayer now.

0:29:35.100,0:29:39.180
You begin to "fire on" - "Give me a hearing heart".

0:29:39.180,0:29:41.620
Don't wait till it is said, "Let's pray" - no.

0:29:41.620,0:29:46.980
Your life should depend on that, "Give me a hearing heart".

0:29:46.980,0:29:48.920
May God bless His Word.

0:29:48.920,0:29:49.820
[Amen.]

0:29:49.820,0:29:51.980
Hallelujah!
