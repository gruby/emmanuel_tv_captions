THE WARNING GOD GAVE TB JOSHUA!!!

0:00:01.340,0:00:03.220
Thank you!

0:00:03.220,0:00:07.620
Good morning!

0:00:07.620,0:00:10.800
You may be seated, thank you.

0:00:16.280,0:00:22.820
There is a common thing today that is really giving me so much concern:

0:00:22.820,0:00:28.280
You see people talking about their situation

0:00:28.280,0:00:30.640
and times without number we have preached about this,

0:00:30.640,0:00:37.640
that situations are not your enemy but friend.

0:00:37.640,0:00:46.000
People talk so much about their situation instead of talking about the Redeemer, Jesus Christ.

0:00:46.000,0:00:49.400
They say, "Situation, situation" - everywhere.

0:00:49.400,0:00:56.280
In my country Nigeria; they are expecting elections in a few days.

0:00:56.280,0:01:01.900
You can see many people...

0:01:01.900,0:01:09.660
Instead of talking about your Redeemer, you are talking about your challenges, your situation.

0:01:09.660,0:01:10.500
Tell your neighbour:

0:01:10.500,0:01:20.300
You talk about your situation so much instead of your Redeemer.

0:01:20.300,0:01:21.780
Hallelujah.

0:01:21.780,0:01:29.600
Situation is not an enemy to a Christian.

0:01:29.600,0:01:36.440
Situations are meant to improve us, not impair us.

0:01:36.440,0:01:44.100
As a Christian, our struggles make us stronger.

0:01:44.100,0:01:48.100
It is meant to improve us.

0:01:48.100,0:01:54.000
Our situation is not like others’, unless you are not a believer.

0:01:54.000,0:02:01.760
When you see someone saying, "I have headache", and you too have headache,

0:02:01.760,0:02:05.420
you are a Christian, and that person is not -

0:02:05.420,0:02:09.680
your headache is not like his headache.

0:02:09.680,0:02:18.180
Your headache is meant to improve you, to strengthen your desire and your determination.

0:02:18.180,0:02:23.100
- For who?
- God.

0:02:23.100,0:02:28.160
They say, "Ah, this problem of this country is too much. What has happened?"

0:02:28.160,0:02:29.120
No.

0:02:29.120,0:02:37.960
Your problem is not like others’.

0:02:37.960,0:02:41.480
They are not meant to kill you or destroy you

0:02:41.480,0:02:46.900
but to strengthen your desire,

0:02:46.900,0:02:52.100
to strengthen your character.

0:02:52.100,0:03:02.520
Let's quickly look at John 16 - the last verse there, 33.

0:03:02.520,0:03:10.400
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.

0:03:10.400,0:03:26.760
In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”

0:03:26.760,0:03:32.440
When you look at the Book of Luke 22:32:

0:03:32.440,0:03:41.260
“But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail…”

0:03:41.260,0:03:53.000
That is to tell you that there will always be an issue that will challenge our faith.

0:03:53.000,0:04:04.300
A true Christian, a true believer is tested.

0:04:04.300,0:04:13.680
The Book of John 16 shows that we are not in Heaven.

0:04:13.680,0:04:20.880
Something must punch us and test our faith.

0:04:20.880,0:04:33.760
It could be hardship, sickness, setback or nightmares – just name it.

0:04:33.760,0:04:45.640
Something must punch, poke and test your faith.

0:04:45.640,0:04:55.140
We are not in Heaven; we are in the world but we are not part of them.

0:04:55.140,0:05:05.180
Why are you so concerned about your situation instead of your Redeemer, Healer, Saviour?

0:05:05.180,0:05:15.740
There will always be an issue that will challenge your faith.

0:05:15.740,0:05:24.540
This is the beauty in our journey to eternal life,

0:05:24.540,0:05:33.660
the beauty in our journey with Christ Jesus.

0:05:33.660,0:05:43.060
What you see as foolish is beauty; it makes our journey valuable.

0:05:43.060,0:05:56.060
If not the situations I have gone through in the past, do you think I would be in the position I am today?

0:05:56.060,0:06:04.560
This is the beauty in our journey to eternal life,

0:06:04.560,0:06:08.400
the beauty in our journey with Christ Jesus.

0:06:08.400,0:06:16.040
That hardship, trouble, name-calling, foolish thing, sickness -

0:06:16.040,0:06:24.520
as a Christian - beauty.

0:06:24.520,0:06:35.740
Don’t forget, Jesus does not maintain what He does not form.

0:06:35.740,0:06:40.500
That is why you have to carry Him along.

0:06:40.500,0:06:45.500
Carry Him along in your marriage, business.

0:06:45.500,0:06:52.460
He does not maintain what He does not form.

0:06:52.460,0:06:55.080
Does He form your marriage?

0:06:55.080,0:07:02.700
Does He form your business?

0:07:02.700,0:07:05.900
And you are asking Him to maintain it.

0:07:05.900,0:07:10.600
You are calling Him to maintain your life, marriage...

0:07:10.600,0:07:16.100
Does He actually form it?

0:07:16.100,0:07:26.400
We misjudge ourselves when we are in circumstances and situations such as failure.

0:07:26.400,0:07:33.900
"Why me? I'm a Christian. Why all this failure, trouble?

0:07:33.900,0:07:38.760
Is it a result of my going to church? Is it a result of stopping smoking?

0:07:38.760,0:07:47.920
Is it a result of stopping going to parties, night clubs? Why? Why me?"

0:07:47.920,0:07:54.980
You begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.

0:07:54.980,0:07:59.100
A TRUE CHRISTIAN IS TESTED

0:07:59.100,0:08:07.880
A man can be poor and yet be a friend of Jesus.

0:08:07.880,0:08:16.280
A man can be sick in body and yet be a candidate of Heaven.

0:08:16.280,0:08:24.680
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:08:24.680,0:08:29.860
We cannot separate warfare from salvation.

0:08:29.860,0:08:30.980
Tell your neighbour.

0:08:30.980,0:08:33.920
We cannot separate warfare from salvation.

0:08:33.920,0:08:35.080
Again.

0:08:35.080,0:08:42.400
We cannot separate warfare from salvation.

0:08:42.400,0:08:55.720
True salvation will put us into direct conflict with satan.

0:08:55.720,0:08:58.940
All these salvations you are talking about are fake.

0:08:58.940,0:09:00.560
You say you are saved.

0:09:00.560,0:09:02.300
What do you mean by being saved?

0:09:02.300,0:09:06.960
You are not saved; that is why you are like this, you are what you are.

0:09:06.960,0:09:09.700
You are not saved yet.

0:09:09.700,0:09:14.040
Salvation is not on the street.

0:09:14.040,0:09:16.020
You say you are saved - who told you?

0:09:16.020,0:09:21.080
You are still a religious person.

0:09:21.080,0:09:25.720
You talk more of your situation instead of your Redeemer.

0:09:25.720,0:09:45.500
True salvation will put you into direct conflict with satan.

0:09:45.500,0:09:47.420
What do I mean?

0:09:47.420,0:09:56.820
A true Christian is tested by his ability to face circumstances and situations.

0:09:56.820,0:09:58.300
Tell your neighbour.

0:09:58.300,0:10:18.280
A true Christian is tested by his ability to face circumstances and situations.

0:10:18.280,0:10:25.260
Little circumstances - you run to witch doctor, just because of challenges.

0:10:25.260,0:10:30.700
From one church to another.

0:10:30.700,0:10:36.880
Open your calendar and number the churches you have attended in searching for Jesus Christ,

0:10:36.880,0:10:40.920
and yet, you are still looking for Jesus.

0:10:40.920,0:10:47.100
Can you name how many times you have been baptized?

0:10:47.100,0:10:50.680
And yet, you are searching for the Holy Ghost.

0:10:50.680,0:10:55.640
And just one baptism leads to Holy Ghost.

0:10:55.640,0:11:00.940
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:11:00.940,0:11:24.020
The true Christian, believer, true you, is tested by his ability to face circumstances and situations.

0:11:24.020,0:11:29.420
Lack of trial, temptation...

0:11:29.420,0:11:41.360
It is impossible to worship God without challenges.

0:11:41.360,0:11:49.900
Where are we going, because this is the season of challenges?

0:11:49.900,0:11:54.800
You talk more of your challenges than your Redeemer.

0:11:54.800,0:12:03.080
This is why I am here today to tell you, my brothers and sisters:

0:12:03.080,0:12:07.880
Jesus does not maintain what He does not form.

0:12:07.880,0:12:15.260
I am just here to remind you what you know already.

0:12:15.260,0:12:21.800
The business is not going well; that is why you are here today? You are wasting your time.

0:12:21.800,0:12:24.840
You should be here for the salvation of your soul.

0:12:24.840,0:12:30.340
It is that salvation that can help you maintain your miracle.

0:12:30.340,0:12:34.980
Think about maintenance.

0:12:34.980,0:12:36.100
What is maintenance?

0:12:36.100,0:12:38.320
Since morning you have been here,

0:12:38.320,0:12:42.060
you have been observing all what has been going on...

0:12:42.060,0:12:44.900
Look at the church.

0:12:44.900,0:12:47.200
What do you see there - empty seats.

0:12:47.200,0:12:51.120
Look at there - empty seats.

0:12:51.120,0:12:54.900
But million people want to enter here.

0:12:54.900,0:13:06.380
It is not the number of people that enter here that matters but the souls that are being saved.

0:13:06.380,0:13:11.620
Yes, millions want to enter.

0:13:11.620,0:13:17.340
I learned this from the Apostles of the old.

0:13:17.340,0:13:21.700
How many of them had a church?

0:13:21.700,0:13:25.180
They evangelized all over.

0:13:25.180,0:13:32.960
We are looking for crowds today, but what of the soul?

0:13:32.960,0:13:36.200
How many of us have prepared to come here today?

0:13:36.200,0:13:40.920
Even half of the people inside the church are not prepared to come here.

0:13:40.920,0:13:45.240
Maybe after sitting down, after a while they begin to think of...

0:13:45.240,0:13:55.080
"I thought I can get a woman here today. I thought I can get an MD here today.

0:13:55.080,0:14:01.560
I thought I can get some connection here. I don't know."

0:14:01.560,0:14:07.260
There are many messengers of satan here; they captured them.

0:14:07.260,0:14:15.360
You have to be very careful - those who are here for the salvation of soul.

0:14:15.360,0:14:21.660
We are not here because of your money or offering.

0:14:21.660,0:14:28.220
If we were here because of offering, that place would not be empty.

0:14:28.220,0:14:41.920
We are not here because of offerings; we are here because of the souls!

0:14:41.920,0:14:48.320
I was in revelation of recent and the Lord showed me,

0:14:48.320,0:14:52.060
"Look, Joshua, see what you are doing."

0:14:52.060,0:14:54.540
I looked at it - "Be careful!"

0:14:54.540,0:14:55.960
I said, "Yes, Sir".

0:14:55.960,0:14:59.220
"Be careful."

0:14:59.220,0:15:03.940
What should I be careful about?

0:15:03.940,0:15:15.440
"Remember, membership is not your strength.

0:15:15.440,0:15:23.400
Look for the souls. Save the soul.

0:15:23.400,0:15:27.800
Don't have the church here because of money, putting the crowd together because of money."

0:15:27.800,0:15:29.260
I said, "Yes, Sir".

0:15:29.260,0:15:31.200
So the grace we are asking for now,

0:15:31.200,0:15:34.120
this is one of the reasons why you have not been seeing me coming out.

0:15:34.120,0:15:38.260
From that entrance, by the time you enter, from there they can ask you to go;

0:15:38.260,0:15:43.320
not people but the Spirit of God will send you back.

0:15:43.320,0:15:49.100
That is the standard of church.

0:15:49.100,0:15:50.780
Read your Bible.

0:15:50.780,0:15:58.860
You enter the Apostolic ministry in the New Testament and the Old Testament -

0:15:58.860,0:16:06.940
by the time you enter, there you will be screened by the Spirit of God.

0:16:06.940,0:16:12.440
"There go, come, go, come..."

0:16:12.440,0:16:20.900
If your salvation is not yet now, from the gate, instead of people screening you -

0:16:20.900,0:16:28.540
this is what I'm asking grace for now -

0:16:28.540,0:16:38.160
not to open the gate for everyone to enter, but from the gate you will find yourself being delivered.

0:16:38.160,0:16:40.640
From there, back home.

0:16:40.640,0:16:44.240
- "No, no, I'm going."
- "Why are you not entering? What happened?"

0:16:44.240,0:16:46.420
- "I'm going."
- "Ok."

0:16:46.420,0:16:49.140
That is it.

0:16:49.140,0:16:53.200
Remember, this is an Apostolic ministry.

0:16:53.200,0:16:55.160
What is an Apostolic ministry?

0:16:55.160,0:16:58.900
The foundation of the Church is the Holy Ghost

0:16:58.900,0:17:05.680
and if it is the Holy Ghost, it is your heart that should worship, not your body.

0:17:05.680,0:17:12.560
But today bodies worship in the church – no longer the hearts of people.

0:17:12.560,0:17:17.460
Faith is of man’s heart, not of man’s body.

0:17:17.460,0:17:20.060
It is our body now that worships.

0:17:20.060,0:17:23.820
Look at me, I'm standing - what can you see?

0:17:23.820,0:17:30.160
Appearance, camouflage you are looking at, but the real person is inside

0:17:30.160,0:17:32.400
you can only see with your heart.

0:17:32.400,0:17:36.240
Can you see anything apart from this camouflage?

0:17:36.240,0:17:39.240
These are the kind of persons we are today.

0:17:39.240,0:17:51.240
This is why you will be looking at the man that is talking - "Is it of God?"

0:17:51.240,0:17:58.500
When a seed is planted, we don't know what it is.

0:17:58.500,0:18:08.220
But the same seed has germinated, and we don't know what it is, and the same tree has borne fruit.

0:18:08.220,0:18:14.720
The same fruit is what we are eating now - you see three Apostles - we are eating their fruit.

0:18:14.720,0:18:19.780
The tree has germinated and is bearing fruit now - the same fruit.

0:18:19.780,0:18:22.720
They are the ones that have been walking since morning and you have seen.

0:18:22.720,0:18:25.480
Yet, you don't know the seed.
