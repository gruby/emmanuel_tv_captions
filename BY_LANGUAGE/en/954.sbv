0:00:00.000,0:00:06.020
My name is Nthabeleng Paulette - 26 years old, from Lesotho.

0:00:06.020,0:00:08.280
Who are the people sitting next to you?

0:00:08.280,0:00:10.020
My aunt and uncle.

0:00:10.020,0:00:13.320
I'm a student, I still haven't completed.

0:00:13.320,0:00:14.520
What are you studying?

0:00:14.520,0:00:17.660
Property studies, valuation and quantity surveying,

0:00:17.660,0:00:20.820
at Namibian University of Science and Technology.

0:00:20.820,0:00:26.240
I have a connective tissue disorder called, ehlers-danlos syndrome,

0:00:26.240,0:00:31.080
which means that I have complications with all of my connective tissues;

0:00:31.080,0:00:37.880
all the organs, joints and tissues in my body can fail at any given time.

0:00:37.880,0:00:40.020
All my joints get dislocated.

0:00:40.020,0:00:47.500
My heart, liver, kidneys, bladder and muscles cannot work.

0:00:47.500,0:00:52.280
I can’t really walk sometimes because I get paralyzed at times.

0:00:52.280,0:00:56.480
Even my eyes dislocate, so I can’t see well; studying for me is very hard.

0:00:56.480,0:01:01.740
I have been out of school many times because of these attacks.

0:01:01.740,0:01:06.420
I haven’t finished school, even though I have been studying for over seven years.

0:01:06.420,0:01:10.720
I can’t do things that others can do – I can’t stand for long or walk.

0:01:10.720,0:01:22.260
I am aided with a wheelchair at times; sometimes I need arm, leg, back or shoulder guards.

0:01:22.260,0:01:28.840
Three to four of my joints get dislocated every day.

0:01:28.840,0:01:31.480
My breathing is also bad.

0:01:31.480,0:01:36.900
I have seizures frequently but it is not epilepsy.

0:01:36.900,0:01:42.340
My lungs are very weak, they cannot compress air so, I cannot breathe very well;

0:01:42.340,0:01:44.500
I have shortness of breath.

0:01:44.500,0:01:50.020
I cannot sing or dance for long; I cannot do any activity or run.

0:01:50.020,0:01:55.520
I have to walk and hold onto something, if I am walking but most of the time I just sit.

0:01:55.520,0:02:00.300
I have had this condition for close to 14 years.

0:02:00.300,0:02:05.240
I have visited almost every doctor in South Africa.

0:02:05.240,0:02:11.840
I have been to Lesotho, Botswana, I even visited doctors in Austria

0:02:11.840,0:02:16.040
and Germany but nobody could help, as nobody understood what I had.

0:02:16.040,0:02:18.640
I see therapists every day -

0:02:18.640,0:02:28.980
I have a bi-connectisist, a chiropractor and a physiotherapist who help me on a daily basis.

0:02:28.980,0:02:32.280
I do hydro-therapy to help my muscles but it doesn’t really help.

0:02:32.280,0:02:36.080
If I don’t do these things, I can’t do anything by myself.

0:02:36.080,0:02:42.040
Doctors have no solution for me except to keep my muscles as fit as possible.

0:02:42.040,0:02:45.600
But none of them can really help me because they do not know what causes these attacks.

0:02:45.600,0:02:49.320
I can have an attack where only the heart is having a problem.

0:02:49.320,0:02:51.720
Sometimes, everything doesn’t work at the same time.

0:02:51.720,0:02:56.600
So, the doctors and specialists don’t understand how to help me;

0:02:56.600,0:02:59.340
they help the symptoms, not the condition.

0:02:59.340,0:03:04.540
I have a lot of dislocations of the shoulder and elbow frequently.

0:03:04.540,0:03:10.500
I have to carry my brace with me to protect my arm in case it comes out.

0:03:10.500,0:03:13.900
If it is out, I have to relocate it and when it is out, it hurts.

0:03:13.900,0:03:15.220
The brace carries my shoulder.

0:03:15.220,0:03:19.900
I cannot carry heavy things at all; if I carry something, it will just pull out

0:03:19.900,0:03:22.560
and when I’m sleeping, it dislocates as well.

0:03:22.560,0:03:26.560
I have very flexible connective tissue, unlike normal people.

0:03:26.560,0:03:29.580
So, my joints get out of place easily.

0:03:29.580,0:03:33.880
As you can see, my finger bends right over – most people can’t do this.

0:03:33.880,0:03:40.360
I got to know about The SCOAN years ago from Emmanuel TV.

0:03:40.360,0:03:44.380
Years ago, my parents were watching and they called me to join them.

0:03:44.380,0:03:49.740
I have seen a lot of people being delivered, especially people with joint issues such as myself.

0:03:49.740,0:03:54.120
I have seen people who have not been walking, walk.

0:03:54.120,0:03:57.680
People who haven’t been able to use their limbs, use their limbs.

0:03:57.680,0:04:04.020
Therefore, I believe I can also be normal and walk like everybody else.

0:04:04.020,0:04:08.300
I believe Jesus will heal me and I will be normal; I will resume my studies

0:04:08.300,0:04:12.000
and I will be like everybody else and have a career.

0:04:12.000,0:04:17.760
I want to live life without pain because I am always in pain – 24/7.

0:04:17.760,0:04:21.540
I pray with you that the Lord Jesus Christ will use His able servant, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:04:21.540,0:04:24.240
to declare you free from these problems, in Jesus' name.

0:04:24.240,0:04:25.440
Amen.

0:04:25.440,0:04:29.660
HEALING TIME

0:04:29.660,0:04:35.180
Help me, Man of God; I have a genetic condition that makes my body non-functional.

0:04:35.180,0:04:36.640
I dislocate all the time.

0:04:36.640,0:04:41.700
Now, I dislocated about 5 times; my knee was out, my shoulder was out, and my jaws were out.

0:04:41.700,0:04:45.900
I can't go to school, I can't do any thing what everybody else does.

0:04:45.900,0:04:50.180
Everything doesn't work; my heart is weak, my lungs are weak.

0:04:50.180,0:04:51.920
Come on!

0:04:51.920,0:04:57.100

0:05:34.460,0:05:35.800
Stand up!

0:05:35.800,0:05:37.220
What is your name?

0:05:37.220,0:05:38.060
Nthabeleng Ramoedi.

0:05:38.060,0:05:42.440
Walk majestically!

0:05:42.440,0:05:44.500
Thank You, Jesus - I'm healed!

0:05:44.500,0:05:52.980
Thank You, Jesus!

0:05:52.980,0:05:57.700
TESTIMONY TIME

0:05:57.700,0:06:02.440
Hello everybody, my name is Nthabeleng Ramoedi from Lesotho.

0:06:02.440,0:06:06.640
I came here because I had ehlers-danlos syndrome -

0:06:06.640,0:06:13.500
a connective tissue that affects every single muscle joint and organ in one's body.

0:06:13.500,0:06:17.440
I couldn't do anything everyone else could do.

0:06:17.440,0:06:23.940
My joints dislocated multiple times; they could pop out at any time, even when I was sleeping.

0:06:23.940,0:06:27.600
I was out of school half of the time, so I haven't even completed my studies,

0:06:27.600,0:06:30.080
even though I have been studying for 8 years.

0:06:30.080,0:06:35.740
I came here with a hope that I would be normal again, and thank God I'm walking,

0:06:35.740,0:06:39.000
which is actually not very normal for me to be walking.

0:06:39.000,0:06:41.700
Or alone talking, having a shortness of breath.

0:06:41.700,0:06:46.780
Usually, I wouldn't say more than 5 sentences; then, I wouldn't be able to breath.

0:06:46.780,0:06:50.320
I would need to have an asthma pump or something to help me breathe.

0:06:50.320,0:06:56.460
But, for the grace of God, since last week Sunday, when the man of God administered healing on me,

0:06:56.460,0:07:00.020
I became a different person, lighter and something...

0:07:00.020,0:07:03.940
OK, just before you explain further, we really want to understand;

0:07:03.940,0:07:08.140
we watched in the clip how you were explaining more about the severity of this condition.

0:07:08.140,0:07:11.180
Can you just once again, for the benefit of those present here and viewers -

0:07:11.180,0:07:17.480
can you just explain what was actually happening in your body, before you received prayer?

0:07:17.480,0:07:24.880
What was the challenge you were having; the pain you were having in your body - just describe to us more.

0:07:24.880,0:07:33.300
The pain I was having; think of walking every single day with about 10 breaks of every joint.

0:07:33.300,0:07:37.120
There was a constant pain that I had every single day.

0:07:37.120,0:07:41.920
Talking was massively painful because my jaws would pop out every time.

0:07:41.920,0:07:48.500
I couldn't eat anything, because if I ate, I couldn't digest - my intestines would twist around,

0:07:48.500,0:07:51.240
and I would look like pregnant half of the time.

0:07:51.240,0:07:53.760
Doctors couldn't help me whatsoever.

0:07:53.760,0:07:58.480
I couldn't see properly because my eyes would dislocate, so writing was a mission.

0:07:58.480,0:08:02.900
I wouldn't be able to read anything; even the Bible - I would hold the Bible for 2 minutes,

0:08:02.900,0:08:06.080
then things would start moving, and I couldn't see letters at all.

0:08:06.080,0:08:13.640
My life was constrained in a deep belittling state, constantly - 24/7.

0:08:13.640,0:08:19.060
I've probably been to more specialists than one human being should.

0:08:19.060,0:08:21.160
I know all sorts of...

0:08:21.160,0:08:27.020
I used to see cardiologists,

0:08:27.020,0:08:29.960
physiotherapists,

0:08:29.960,0:08:36.080
joints specialists, bones specialists, brain specialists, because nothing worked

0:08:36.080,0:08:38.560
and none of them could help me at all.

0:08:38.560,0:08:43.800
They would only help to stabilize me, so I would be able to at least receive medications.

0:08:43.800,0:08:47.720
But sometimes my body even rejected the medications they gave me.

0:08:47.720,0:08:49.700
So nothing actually worked.

0:08:49.700,0:08:52.760
The only thing that kept me going was that if they worked with my muscles,

0:08:52.760,0:08:56.680
it made them stronger, so I could take 10 steps instead of 3 steps.

0:08:56.680,0:09:07.180
Or, I could be able to breathe longer than I usually did by using a nebulizer or some sort of machine.

0:09:07.180,0:09:12.640
Especially in winters - for some weird reason, I would constantly be in the emergency room,

0:09:12.640,0:09:15.680
every other week or every other day.

0:09:15.680,0:09:23.400
How many diseases did the doctors actually diagnose in your body, as a result of this tissue disorder?

0:09:23.400,0:09:29.860
So far, I think I was in the range of between 60 and 70 conditions and diseases.

0:09:29.860,0:09:34.140
I could relate to almost everyone in the hospital who came through.

0:09:34.140,0:09:36.240
If you had diabetes, I had it,

0:09:36.240,0:09:41.260
if you had some sort of ulcer or intestinal issue, I had it,

0:09:41.260,0:09:44.240
if you had any sort of seizure, I've had it before.

0:09:44.240,0:09:50.680
So pretty much, I had every little problem you could think of.

0:09:50.680,0:09:56.440
We are listening to our sister; she said that medically, because of this very rare disorder she had,

0:09:56.440,0:10:02.180
the doctors actually diagnosed more than 60 to 70  different diseases in her system,

0:10:02.180,0:10:06.640
because of the abnormality she had as a result of this condition.

0:10:06.640,0:10:11.120
Just tell us, sister, you said that at any given time your joints would dislocate;

0:10:11.120,0:10:13.240
your shoulder, your knees, your arm -

0:10:13.240,0:10:18.860
just describe what would happen each time your shoulder or other part of your body would dislocate.

0:10:18.860,0:10:21.820
What would you have to do to try to fix the situation?

0:10:21.820,0:10:24.900
What was the kind of pain you would have at that moment?

0:10:24.900,0:10:29.800
Well, I don't know if anyone of you has broken a bone before, falling from a building or during an accident,

0:10:29.800,0:10:34.100
but it feels like you are crushing a bone every time something is dislocated.

0:10:34.100,0:10:38.700
There are two options: Most times, I would have to be rushed to the emergence room,

0:10:38.700,0:10:40.940
so the doctor could relocate a joint.

0:10:40.940,0:10:44.560
They always had to put me under heavy medication before they could put it back in,

0:10:44.560,0:10:50.160
because they were traumatising a lot of muscles around the joint, if it came out.

0:10:50.160,0:10:54.420
With time, because it became a part of my life, I learned how to put back some of the joints;

0:10:54.420,0:10:58.120
like the jaw one was a bit easier for me to put back,

0:10:58.120,0:11:02.660
or I would ask any other individual around me, and tell them how to move around,

0:11:02.660,0:11:06.240
by directing their hand, or something, so that they could put it back.

0:11:06.240,0:11:11.280
But normally, it was always an emergency to go to the doctor.

0:11:11.280,0:11:15.640
We are hearing what our sister is saying that on every day she would find a situation,

0:11:15.640,0:11:18.200
whereby a part of her body would actually dislocate,

0:11:18.200,0:11:22.560
and the pain she would experience would be as if she had broken a bone in her body.

0:11:22.560,0:11:27.280
If anyone has experienced that, you would know the magnitude of the pain involved.

0:11:27.280,0:11:31.860
She came to the point where she herself would physically start putting the parts of her body

0:11:31.860,0:11:34.680
that were dislocated back to the right position,

0:11:34.680,0:11:38.920
because she was so accustomed to the different parts of her body dislocating,

0:11:38.920,0:11:44.980
or, she would find someone nearby and instruct them how to actually put that part of her body back,

0:11:44.980,0:11:49.080
to the correct position, because of the nature of that problem.

0:11:49.080,0:11:55.260
You mean to say sister, this is how you have been living your life for many years, in that intense pain and agony?

0:11:55.260,0:11:57.160
Yes, that is exactly how I have been living.

0:11:57.160,0:12:05.720
For example, I think the worst kind of dislocation that I experienced is a rib cage coming completely out.

0:12:05.720,0:12:13.400
If anybody has had a fracture of a rib, or had it bruised for some reason, due to sports injury,

0:12:13.400,0:12:18.260
he would know that it is probably the worst bone to get fractured at any point.

0:12:18.260,0:12:20.120
It is massively...

0:12:20.120,0:12:24.020
It feels like you are dying, pretty much.

0:12:24.020,0:12:28.660
I don't know what death feels like, but I feel like that's probably the worst type of pain anybody can feel.

0:12:28.660,0:12:30.680
And the hip as well.

0:12:30.680,0:12:36.320
Anybody with a hip replacement - usually old people would sympathize because they understand how it feels,

0:12:36.320,0:12:41.520
but I felt all that agony pain at the early age of 12.

0:12:41.520,0:12:46.500
So, pretty much, I have been feeling pain through all my life,

0:12:46.500,0:12:51.180
which is why this is very weird - I have never felt like this before.

0:12:51.180,0:12:54.340
We are still going to come to how our sister received her healing,

0:12:54.340,0:12:58.160
but we are just asking these questions, so that our viewers around the world, and those present here

0:12:58.160,0:13:04.280
can know the power of God, that we are under, by the grace of God - here, in the arena of liberty.

0:13:04.280,0:13:08.100
Now, sister, you said that because of this constant pain,

0:13:08.100,0:13:12.180
just describe - were you able to live a normal kind of a childhood,

0:13:12.180,0:13:17.400
like for example with your going to school, or the kind of activities other young children would do?

0:13:17.400,0:13:21.800
How did this condition really affect you to separate you from the crowd,

0:13:21.800,0:13:25.080
in the sense that you couldn't do what others in school were doing?

0:13:25.080,0:13:30.540
I couldn't do sports for example, or go on tours if something were to happen at school.

0:13:30.540,0:13:34.480
I would always be conformed to a classroom.

0:13:34.480,0:13:37.360
Even in the classroom itself, I would always be...

0:13:37.360,0:13:41.300
Every week there was a mystery that an ambulance was going to come

0:13:41.300,0:13:42.860
and I would have to go to the emergency room.

0:13:42.860,0:13:46.400
So much that when there was an ambulance around the school,

0:13:46.400,0:13:52.920
people seeing me walking or sitting would say, "Oh, it wasn't you? We thought it was you again".

0:13:52.920,0:13:59.100
I was so accustomed to always being pulled out of school that it was a part of me.

0:13:59.100,0:14:06.540
I didn't do any activity, because if I tried to jump over something, I would break something,

0:14:06.540,0:14:12.540
if I tried to write something in class, I would write two sentences,

0:14:12.540,0:14:14.860
then my arm would dislocate, so it wouldn't really work.

0:14:14.860,0:14:19.240
Even exams; they were trying to figure out how to make me write exams,

0:14:19.240,0:14:22.040
without me actually having to be in pain.

0:14:22.040,0:14:27.100
Most of my final high-school exams, I wrote them with my left hand.

0:14:27.100,0:14:33.360
By the grace of God, I don't know how, I still passed anyway.

0:14:33.360,0:14:38.700
Sister, we also want you to describe; you said that it reached a point where you couldn't even sleep,

0:14:38.700,0:14:41.240
because of the severity of this pain.

0:14:41.240,0:14:43.820
Can you just describe what would happen to you in the night?

0:14:43.820,0:14:47.740
What was a normal night like for you because of this?

0:14:47.740,0:14:53.780
Most people probably know what insomnia is - think of it as being constant.

0:14:53.780,0:15:00.140
When doctors would do sleep-test on me to see my neurological balance,

0:15:00.140,0:15:07.500
one neurologist told me that it seems as if I haven't slept in over 3 years.

0:15:07.500,0:15:14.920
Because my brain is always working, the chemicals in the brain were never balanced, so I was never asleep.

0:15:14.920,0:15:20.800
I would close my eyes in the midst of hoping to sleep, but I would just toss and turn the whole time

0:15:20.800,0:15:26.840
or be up because my bladder was always full, even though I peed

0:15:26.840,0:15:30.560
like a teaspoon of pee, but I would always have to rush to the bathroom.

0:15:30.560,0:15:33.160
So, I never really slept.

0:15:33.160,0:15:36.540
Because of that, throughout the day you would be tired, in whatever you would do.

0:15:36.540,0:15:40.760
You would easily just find yourself sleeping off, because you hadn't actually slept in the night?

0:15:40.760,0:15:41.480
True.

0:15:41.480,0:15:45.620
Half of my classes I would have my head on the desk.

0:15:45.620,0:15:50.220
Some lecturers thought I was just an annoying child because I never really spoke about my condition.

0:15:50.220,0:15:53.840
In a classroom of 400 students - who cares?

0:15:53.840,0:15:56.860
You are just there to do your work and therefore you have to stand up,

0:15:56.860,0:16:00.460
but people would just be like, "Why do you always rest your head on the table?",

0:16:00.460,0:16:03.160
or "Why can't you sit up straight like everybody else?"

0:16:03.160,0:16:09.100
Because of my fracture on the back of my spine, it literally curved in, so I couldn't stand up straight;

0:16:09.100,0:16:15.080
in fact even standing straight like this was not a normal thing for me - I would have to slouch back,

0:16:15.080,0:16:18.880
because my spine couldn't stand up straight.

0:16:18.880,0:16:21.300
We saw in the interview - we can actually see on the board here;

0:16:21.300,0:16:25.480
there were some pictures that were displayed, showing you in some unusual positions.

0:16:25.480,0:16:28.920
Could you just describe to us again, for the benefit of our viewers,

0:16:28.920,0:16:34.160
why we are seeing these pictures, and what your body condition was like before?

0:16:34.160,0:16:39.420
For example, this particular picture shows that I was hyper flexible,

0:16:39.420,0:16:47.880
meaning that when your body stops at a certain fraction, mine "over-moved" - it was extensively bendy.

0:16:47.880,0:16:55.480
Most people with this condition don't pick it up until when they try to move, something pops out.

0:16:55.480,0:16:58.800
When you are a kid, it is not easy to detect; they just thought I was a flexible child -

0:16:58.800,0:17:00.960
maybe I was going to join the circus, or something.

0:17:00.960,0:17:04.880
But then, as I grew older, I was supposed to be stiffer, but it didn't get stiff at all.

0:17:04.880,0:17:08.040
It just got lax and lax.

0:17:08.040,0:17:10.560
I could fit in a box, if you wanted to put me in there.

0:17:10.560,0:17:16.440
There was nothing holding my joints in place, so things would just pop out all the time.

0:17:16.440,0:17:23.740
This particular picture shows that I was usually under some sort of machine constantly to help me breath,

0:17:23.740,0:17:26.660
because my breathing was really bad.

0:17:26.660,0:17:33.740
This is one of my best friends, from the past obviously, not anymore - my sling.

0:17:33.740,0:17:38.820
It would always have to be in one of my school bags, even if I left the house with no dislocation,

0:17:38.820,0:17:43.060
because chances were that the day would not end without something popping out.

0:17:43.060,0:17:45.980
And if I left it hanging, it would hurt longer.

0:17:45.980,0:17:50.200
This was to support so that nobody touched or bumped me by mistake,

0:17:50.200,0:17:53.140
not knowing that it hurt or went out.

0:17:53.140,0:17:56.540
These are my knee guards, different types.

0:17:56.540,0:18:02.640
The other one is metal-based, because there was always liquid transforming from my spine to my knee,

0:18:02.640,0:18:05.540
so my knee would just swell up with a lot of liquid.

0:18:05.540,0:18:10.860
They couldn't drain it because if you opened any part of my body, I would bleed non-stop.

0:18:10.860,0:18:16.160
So, operations were never advised, because every time I was opened, something was going to happen,

0:18:16.160,0:18:21.100
therefore I was just "bleed-dry".

0:18:21.100,0:18:24.820
In conclusion, this was a miserable way to live.

0:18:24.820,0:18:28.500
I couldn't go out, I have not done anything teenagers do;

0:18:28.500,0:18:33.260
I just read about it, or hear about it from my sisters; like they went out to a concert -

0:18:33.260,0:18:36.260
even a gospel concert, I've never done that.

0:18:36.260,0:18:42.960
Every time the weather changed from hot to cold, from evening to night, I reacted and got sick.

0:18:42.960,0:18:50.560
If I were to move out of the room with air conditioning, and it was hot outside, I would probably faint.

0:18:50.560,0:18:52.640
Viewers around the world, we have listened to our sister.

0:18:52.640,0:18:57.680
This is the severity of this very rare condition that she had when she came in.

0:18:57.680,0:19:02.320
Just tell us sister - how rare is this condition that you were having in your body?

0:19:02.320,0:19:06.360
Are you aware of how many people around the world have this kind of condition?

0:19:06.360,0:19:10.800
It's extensively rare.

0:19:10.800,0:19:17.340
Even in the countries where we think medicine is widely more exposed than down here in Africa,

0:19:17.340,0:19:25.360
only about 10% of the whole population is diagnosed.

0:19:25.360,0:19:36.120
And only 1 person in 100 000 might have it - that is how rare it is,

0:19:36.120,0:19:38.880
but no one knows what to do about it.

0:19:38.880,0:19:41.500
It takes years for most people to get diagnosed.

0:19:41.500,0:19:52.160
Even a doctor herself, who did research, only discovered in her fifties that she had this sickness,

0:19:52.160,0:19:58.440
and she was a practising doctor for more than 10 years.

0:19:58.440,0:20:05.220
We thank God that in the midst of this very extreme condition, God brought you to The SCOAN.

0:20:05.220,0:20:10.540
We saw on the clip earlier, when you cried out for prayer, as the man of God,

0:20:10.540,0:20:13.260
Prophet T.B. Joshua passed by, and he began to pray for you.

0:20:13.260,0:20:18.080
We just want you to describe to us, at that moment, can you just relive what happened,

0:20:18.080,0:20:20.800
as the Prophet began to pray for you?

0:20:20.800,0:20:26.780
When the Prophet came over, for some reason I couldn't talk for the first couple of seconds.

0:20:26.780,0:20:28.900
Then I don't know what happened afterwards.

0:20:28.900,0:20:35.180
I remember being on the floor and I was shaking uncontrollably - I don't know the reasons.

0:20:35.180,0:20:38.860
The next thing I heard was him telling me to look him in the eyes -

0:20:38.860,0:20:42.560
the eyes were a bit weary, so it took a while.

0:20:42.560,0:20:45.300
After I looked at him straight up and I was standing,

0:20:45.300,0:20:51.700
I felt some sort of relief; as if I became 10 times lighter than I usually am.

0:20:51.700,0:20:56.440
I almost fell over because I wasn't aware that I was that light.

0:20:56.440,0:21:00.040
Then I started walking and I started feeling no pain,

0:21:00.040,0:21:03.200
and I felt like, "What is going on here? This is not normal."

0:21:03.200,0:21:08.860
I was supposed to be taking my time up, but I was shaking like the wind was just blowing me.

0:21:08.860,0:21:15.440
It was some sense of relief and I just knew right there that everything that I had been through was over.

0:21:15.440,0:21:19.300
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:21:19.300,0:21:24.780
You mean for the first time in your life, that you can recall, as you stood up at that moment,

0:21:24.780,0:21:27.620
you did not feel pain in your body?

0:21:27.620,0:21:32.120
Yes, which is still overwhelming really, to tell you the truth.

0:21:32.120,0:21:35.400
And ever since that prayer you received, can you just describe to us -

0:21:35.400,0:21:40.980
what are the incredible changes you've seen in your body, both physically and in terms of the pain.

0:21:40.980,0:21:44.060
Just describe to us what has happened after that prayer.

0:21:44.060,0:21:47.200
I can now do the head and shoulders thing.

0:21:47.200,0:21:50.820
The feet for example; my feet could never touch the ground fully;

0:21:50.820,0:21:56.780
but for the first time my toes and everything is on the shoe, which is very weird.

0:21:56.780,0:21:59.960
And I can walk, without feeling any pain.

0:21:59.960,0:22:05.500
Every time I walked; if you were close to me, you would hear my joints pop in and out making sound.

0:22:05.500,0:22:11.720
There is no more sound.

0:22:11.720,0:22:14.100
I can write properly now.

0:22:14.100,0:22:21.220
I wrote my name with one of the evangelists, and she was like, "It doesn't look like your handwriting".

0:22:21.220,0:22:25.680
Last week I wrote my name but it looked like a cat's scratch.

0:22:25.680,0:22:31.080
You couldn't make out whether the "E" wasn't an "A", or the "L" was a "T", but right now I can write.

0:22:31.080,0:22:36.140
For some reason I can read the Bible without my glasses even,

0:22:36.140,0:22:40.660
which I couldn't do previously, because my eyes would dislocate.

0:22:40.660,0:22:44.820
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:22:44.820,0:22:50.440
You said before that at any given time parts of your body would dislocate, pop out.

0:22:50.440,0:22:55.220
Ever since that prayer, just describe the changes you have seen in that area.

0:22:55.220,0:22:57.180
Ever since the prayer...

0:22:57.180,0:23:01.060
I would have dislocated my jaw by now of course, because I have been talking too much,

0:23:01.060,0:23:05.360
which is actually quite nice to talk.

0:23:05.360,0:23:09.380
Usually my hand would get stuck, if I was using my hands too much,

0:23:09.380,0:23:19.180
but no finger, no elbow, no hip, no neck, nothing has popped out ever since Sunday.

0:23:19.180,0:23:23.640
People who were with me before the man of God came to me would know that,

0:23:23.640,0:23:28.140
they were worried and trying to figure out how to put back my knee and my shoulder.

0:23:28.140,0:23:31.780
They were all actually very hysterical because they have never seen something like that before.

0:23:31.780,0:23:35.320
Some other person fainted for two minutes, I think.

0:23:35.320,0:23:40.200
You mean that on that Sunday before prayer, some parts of your body dislocated?

0:23:40.200,0:23:45.120
Five minutes before the man of God prayed for me, my joints had popped out.

0:23:45.120,0:23:49.180
As he came, there were already things being put back in place.

0:23:49.180,0:23:52.860
He moved and passed me and we were trying to fix one,

0:23:52.860,0:23:58.600
and then he moved again; when he came back, we were fixing the shoulder that came out,

0:23:58.600,0:24:03.860
but about 4 others had popped out within the 5 minutes space of time.

0:24:03.860,0:24:06.660
People of God, we can understand the nature of this miracle.

0:24:06.660,0:24:11.500
Our sister said that on that day, just minutes before Prophet T.B. Joshua even prayed for her,

0:24:11.500,0:24:14.180
5 different parts of her body dislocated.

0:24:14.180,0:24:17.660
But ever since that touch, as we are seeing on the screen right now,

0:24:17.660,0:24:24.180
no single part of her body is dislocated and she is doing things, that she could never do before.

0:24:24.180,0:24:28.380
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:24:28.380,0:24:30.740
Sister, you said before that you couldn't even write.

0:24:30.740,0:24:35.480
Could you just, for the glory of God, demonstrate what you can now do,

0:24:35.480,0:24:41.700
just to testify to the people of God the wonderful healing in your life.

0:24:41.700,0:24:47.980
So we can see our sister there; she is actually writing on a board.

0:24:47.980,0:24:55.200

Healing Testimony

0:24:55.200,0:24:56.020
Thank You, Jesus!

0:24:56.020,0:25:01.220
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:25:01.220,0:25:04.280
You mean to say, sister, you couldn't do this before?

0:25:04.280,0:25:07.960
It would look like a cat's scratch, trust me.

0:25:07.960,0:25:15.880
You wouldn't know if the "G" was an "O" or whether the "D" was cojoined to the "O", or something like that.

0:25:15.880,0:25:17.300
Wow. Thank You, Jesus Christ!

0:25:17.300,0:25:21.520
Now, for the glory of God; we just want to see you walking freely in the midst of the people of God,

0:25:21.520,0:25:25.200
to demonstrate what you can now do that you couldn't do before,

0:25:25.200,0:25:30.040
or if you attempted to do it before, a part of your body would dislocate.

0:25:30.040,0:25:35.640
Wow, we can see our sister walking freely, in the midst of the people of God.

0:25:35.640,0:25:40.360
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:25:40.360,0:25:44.780
You said, sister, that before, you couldn't even stand up straight, like you are standing now.

0:25:44.780,0:25:46.760
No, I couldn't stand up straight.

0:25:46.760,0:25:51.380
I would always - I had a hunchback.

0:25:51.380,0:25:53.460
But now I'm all straight up.

0:25:53.460,0:25:57.180
I could even try modelling, if I wanted to.

0:25:57.180,0:25:59.440
My posture is all back now.

0:25:59.440,0:26:03.860
Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:26:03.860,0:26:06.580
Indeed, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.

0:26:06.580,0:26:12.140
Our sister knows the extent of the differences in her life after that prayer.

0:26:12.140,0:26:15.740
For her entire life, she has been in pain and that has been her normal life.

0:26:15.740,0:26:20.800
She has been accustomed to pain, to different parts of her body dislocating at any given time.

0:26:20.800,0:26:24.860
But right now, we can see her standing freely in the midst of the people of God.

0:26:24.860,0:26:31.540
Sister, you said before you couldn't even talk like this to people for such a long time.

0:26:31.540,0:26:38.420
True, because in-between I would probably gasp for air like, "Hold on", then come back to you.

0:26:38.420,0:26:44.660
Or my eyes would start rolling because I had seizures as well,

0:26:44.660,0:26:50.720
or I would have to sit down for a bit, and I would never stand this long, without needing a chair,

0:26:50.720,0:26:53.060
which is actually very new for me.

0:26:53.060,0:26:57.760
Usually I would just pass lines; I would never queue.

0:26:57.760,0:27:01.400
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:27:01.400,0:27:05.120
This is an incredible miracle and we give all the glory to God.

0:27:05.120,0:27:10.440
Sister, before listening to your advice, we would like to hear from our brother here as well

0:27:10.440,0:27:16.520
who has one or two words to say concerning the miraculous healing in your life.

0:27:16.520,0:27:21.500
Nthabeleng Ramoedi & Family
Healing Testimony

0:27:21.500,0:27:30.580
We are from Lesotho, and we are managing a private hospital that God Almighty offered unto us.

0:27:30.580,0:27:41.720
When medicine calls a diagnosis a syndrome, you should know we really are not sure of what is happening.

0:27:41.720,0:27:53.920
This young lady is my niece and we encountered the first, very severe symptoms of her disease in 2010.

0:27:53.920,0:27:59.160
She had just visited us and she developed this seizure.

0:27:59.160,0:28:03.740
I would say that was the most severe one that she had,

0:28:03.740,0:28:11.440
because we knew that from time to time she used to dislocate diverse joints in her body.

0:28:11.440,0:28:17.920
With this type of seizure she had, we gave her all medications that we knew,

0:28:17.920,0:28:22.720
that were supposed to abort her seizures but they couldn't help.

0:28:22.720,0:28:31.300
We had to refer her to a more equipped hospital, where she could meet a neurologist.

0:28:31.300,0:28:36.980
All diverse investigations have been done of her condition.

0:28:36.980,0:28:48.360
In this particular case, an EEG was done in order to conclude whether she was an epileptic

0:28:48.360,0:28:53.740
but all without a conclusive test.

0:28:53.740,0:29:01.820
Her heart muscles from time to time would be weak, her lungs would be weak, she would be on nebulizers,

0:29:01.820,0:29:08.940
she has had heart ECGs done several times, but all with normal results.

0:29:08.940,0:29:20.480
In short: she has been through all different tests, but it came out without any conclusive diagnosis.

0:29:20.480,0:29:27.600
Definitely, if muscles are not well, it means every organ can never function,

0:29:27.600,0:29:31.680
because we all are made of muscles and ligaments.

0:29:31.680,0:29:37.100
That is why her body could not control anything of her own.

0:29:37.100,0:29:43.900
But on top of all, I just praise God; I thank God for the healing that she received

0:29:43.900,0:29:49.400
because ever since last week I have been with her day and night

0:29:49.400,0:29:53.440
and she has never had what she had before we came here.

0:29:53.440,0:29:57.280
And I just thank God for that.

0:29:57.280,0:30:00.580
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:30:00.580,0:30:06.100
Madam, speaking from a medical perspective; what can you just testify about what happened

0:30:06.100,0:30:10.620
when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for her and those changes that you've seen in her body since then?

0:30:10.620,0:30:14.720
What can you say as a medical doctor concerning this?

0:30:14.720,0:30:22.880
When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to meet her, I personally knew that the devil was going to give up.

0:30:22.880,0:30:29.440
I am a living testimony because I had a lumbar spondylosis, for which I was prayed for,

0:30:29.440,0:30:32.540
and here I am standing.

0:30:32.540,0:30:39.520
What she went through was a major seizure, that every organ in her body just refused

0:30:39.520,0:30:44.660
and was arrested by the Spirit of God that was facing her.

0:30:44.660,0:30:47.880
At the end of it all, she was freed.

0:30:47.880,0:30:56.180
Immediately after the prayer, she asked to go to the toilet, and she was virtually running in front of me.

0:30:56.180,0:31:00.240
Being a very jovial person, she started dancing for everybody.

0:31:00.240,0:31:03.720
She has been perfectly normal, she has been eating normally,

0:31:03.720,0:31:07.920
she has never had the abdominal blow that she would normally have

0:31:07.920,0:31:11.440
and none of her joints has ever popped out.

0:31:11.440,0:31:15.720
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!

0:31:15.720,0:31:18.100
We give all the glory to God.

0:31:18.100,0:31:22.580
We just would like to ask you, madam: What is your word of advice, especially as a medical personnel,

0:31:22.580,0:31:26.260
what would be your word of advice and encouragement to our viewers all over the world,

0:31:26.260,0:31:31.780
and those who may be suffering from such an unusual disease; one that medically has no cure -

0:31:31.780,0:31:34.540
what is your word of advice to them?

0:31:34.540,0:31:43.000
Doctors, medical personnel, God uses us to treat but He is the only One who can heal.

0:31:43.000,0:31:47.780
When you are faced with conditions that are beyond our own understanding,

0:31:47.780,0:31:52.500
that is the time when we have to say, "God  should take over".

0:31:52.500,0:31:57.820
We don't need to rely upon our own strength, or knowledge

0:31:57.820,0:32:01.420
because indeed, we are limited as human beings

0:32:01.420,0:32:10.200
and we have to be counsellors of our own patients, for them to know that God has the final say.

0:32:10.200,0:32:13.460
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:32:13.460,0:32:18.500
We really thank God for the role that our mother and father played in encouraging our sister to come

0:32:18.500,0:32:22.640
to The SCOAN, and taking care of her to the point where she received that prayer.

0:32:22.640,0:32:25.440
We would like to hear a word from our father here as well.

0:32:25.440,0:32:26.600
Sir, you are welcome.

0:32:26.600,0:32:31.860
Please, introduce yourself to us and tell us what you can say about the wonderful healing

0:32:31.860,0:32:33.700
in the life of our sister here.

0:32:33.700,0:32:36.160
Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:32:36.160,0:32:37.720
Indeed, God is with us.

0:32:37.720,0:32:41.440
Of course, if God is with us, who can be against you?

0:32:41.440,0:32:43.560
No one.

0:32:43.560,0:32:45.120
The patient has said it all.

0:32:45.120,0:32:48.660
I'm using the word "patient" because I'm used to that word.

0:32:48.660,0:32:50.300
The patient has said it all.

0:32:50.300,0:32:55.980
Nthabeleng Ramoedi & Family
Healing Testimony

0:32:55.980,0:32:58.080
I'm from Lesotho.

0:32:58.080,0:33:03.960
We have a private hospital, God has blessed us with,

0:33:03.960,0:33:10.600
where we first saw the problem of epileptic seizures, which really were not epileptic.

0:33:10.600,0:33:17.460
On my left side is my wife; we have been married for over 30 years, and we thank God for that.

0:33:17.460,0:33:21.520
The young lady is the niece.

0:33:21.520,0:33:25.300
They have said everything about the condition.

0:33:25.300,0:33:31.420
You see, every organ in the body has a collagen fibre, or muscular tissue.

0:33:31.420,0:33:36.240
If you have a problem in the brain, obviously it may result in a fit.

0:33:36.240,0:33:43.400
For you to have multiple conditions in the intestines, joins, jaws of any kind,

0:33:43.400,0:33:47.580
then it is a confusion that people would treat in isolation.

0:33:47.580,0:33:50.060
If you have an eye problem, it is treated in isolation,

0:33:50.060,0:33:52.160
if you have an intestine problem, it is treated in isolation,

0:33:52.160,0:33:54.820
if you have a bladder issue, it is treated in isolation.

0:33:54.820,0:34:01.820
It is almost impossible to have all these conditions under one's eye, except the eyes of God.

0:34:01.820,0:34:09.680
So, we decided to bring her to The SCOAN, where we have received deliverance and healing.

0:34:09.680,0:34:15.360
My wife is a living testimony; she had spondylosis and disc prolapse, and here she is standing.

0:34:15.360,0:34:18.380
There was no reason for us to doubt God.

0:34:18.380,0:34:29.900
In fact, I would want to say that in this world today, we have science, medicine, and organizations;

0:34:29.900,0:34:32.340
those are the things we believe in,

0:34:32.340,0:34:39.460
without realizing that it is God who has used people to create this science and medicine.

0:34:39.460,0:34:44.860
We should realise that when we fall out of rope, we should hang on to faith.

0:34:44.860,0:34:49.700
That is the very reason why we know that doctors fall sick as well.

0:34:49.700,0:34:53.160
If doctors knew everything, doctors would never be sick.

0:34:53.160,0:34:57.200
If scientists knew everything, the scientists would never be sick.

0:34:57.200,0:35:01.060
We all do false things, because we are natural, human beings.

0:35:01.060,0:35:05.760
We must turn to the supernatural, and that is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.

0:35:05.760,0:35:07.340
We thank God for the miracle.

0:35:07.340,0:35:11.900
The storm is over - thank God!

0:35:11.900,0:35:14.880
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:35:14.880,0:35:19.840
Sir, what can you testify about the changes in the life of your niece after the prayer,

0:35:19.840,0:35:21.380
and what can you say about what happened

0:35:21.380,0:35:25.180
when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for her on that day last week.

0:35:25.180,0:35:31.780
Yes; just before that, her shoulder dislocated and I had to push it back.

0:35:31.780,0:35:36.280
While she was sitting down, the knee came out of the position and I was trying to put it back,

0:35:36.280,0:35:41.580
and T.B. Joshua was praying for a lady just next to her.

0:35:41.580,0:35:52.060
Then Prophet T.B. Joshua came and as spoken to by Jesus, he was used to pray for the young lady

0:35:52.060,0:35:56.160
and all of a sudden she was on the floor.

0:35:56.160,0:36:02.160
Just a stretch of the arm again and everything, the storm in her life calmed down.

0:36:02.160,0:36:09.240
Since then, she has never had any dislocation from any single, big or small joint.

0:36:09.240,0:36:12.560
Neither has she had any convulsion or seizure.

0:36:12.560,0:36:17.180
She is fine, she is able to eat, she doesn't have any issues with her intestines.

0:36:17.180,0:36:21.160
She has actually had a constipation, which she had for 3 months before,

0:36:21.160,0:36:23.560
but now she doesn't have any condition like that.

0:36:23.560,0:36:26.560
She is fine and free - free at last!

0:36:26.560,0:36:31.040
Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:36:31.040,0:36:35.140
And we know, as you rightly said, sir, that medically, this condition was incurable,

0:36:35.140,0:36:39.520
there was nothing that could be done more than had been attempted from a medical perspective.

0:36:39.520,0:36:42.400
But today, she is a living testimony to the glory of God.

0:36:42.400,0:36:49.560
What is your word of advice, sir, to our viewers around the world, especially those in the medical field?

0:36:49.560,0:36:54.580
My dear brethren in the medical and scientific field:

0:36:54.580,0:36:59.840
I would want to say that we are material beings and God uses us - it is good.

0:36:59.840,0:37:03.700
God has used us, God is still using us and God will use us.

0:37:03.700,0:37:07.660
Science and medicine are created by God;

0:37:07.660,0:37:15.340
therefore, we should know our limits and we should not be oblivious or boastful

0:37:15.340,0:37:18.520
when we take care of a patient and the patient gets fine.

0:37:18.520,0:37:27.440
We should know our limits and we should give credit to God, because we treat but God is the Healer.

0:37:27.440,0:37:31.040
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.

0:37:31.040,0:37:33.600
Finally, we just want to hear the last word from our sister.

0:37:33.600,0:37:38.860
We would like to hear from you, sister; what is your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world?

0:37:38.860,0:37:43.100
You are a living testimony to the power of God, and healing you've received.

0:37:43.100,0:37:47.340
What is your word of encouragement and advice to our viewers?

0:37:47.340,0:37:50.800
Never, never lose faith.

0:37:50.800,0:37:58.660
It doesn't matter how big your trial or situation is; don't let your situation determine who you are,

0:37:58.660,0:38:01.160
because God's time is always the best.

0:38:01.160,0:38:08.640
If someone told me 10 years ago, or 2 weeks ago that I would be here standing,

0:38:08.640,0:38:17.160
talking to all of you without any pain, I would have probably said, "Ha ha ha".

0:38:17.160,0:38:23.920
But with God's grace, I'm here and I'm not sarcastically laughing; I'm laughing because I'm happy.

0:38:23.920,0:38:28.660
I'm smiling for the first time without having any pain, I'm overjoyed.

0:38:28.660,0:38:35.880
Quite frankly, after the service, I will ask whoever is around, "Let's go dancing and praise the Lord".

0:38:35.880,0:38:39.200
Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:38:39.200,0:38:42.240
We can see this sling that your aunt is holding.

0:38:42.240,0:38:45.940
You said that this was something before you had to carry with you anywhere you went

0:38:45.940,0:38:48.820
because at any given time, a part of your body would dislocate.

0:38:48.820,0:38:50.440
What do you want to do with this now?

0:38:50.440,0:38:55.380
Let's just shove it off somewhere.

0:38:55.380,0:39:00.080
Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:39:00.080,0:39:02.680
Brethren, we have listened to our sister's testimony.

0:39:02.680,0:39:09.320
Just imagine if God Almighty could heal her from a condition that had plagued her entire life,

0:39:09.320,0:39:17.400
causing extreme pain 24/7, today she is walking freely, living freely without pain to the glory of God,

0:39:17.400,0:39:19.300
what is your own situation?

0:39:19.300,0:39:24.680
Just use your faith to put a demand on the anointing that is available here,

0:39:24.680,0:39:30.100
and the same God that healed our sister is present to touch your own case today,

0:39:30.100,0:39:35.000
and your case will not escape the anointing of God, in Jesus' name.

0:39:35.000,0:39:38.420
If you believe that, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:39:38.420,0:39:38.920
