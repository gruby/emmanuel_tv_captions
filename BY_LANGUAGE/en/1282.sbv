Emmanuel!
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:00:02.680,0:00:04.140
Good Morning, Church!

0:00:04.140,0:00:06.280
My name is Damian.

0:00:06.280,0:00:08.420
I'm from Benue State, Nigeria.

0:00:08.420,0:00:11.460
I'm an Uber driver.

0:00:11.460,0:00:15.220
He is my friend from Ghana.

0:00:15.220,0:00:17.220
This is my mum.

0:00:17.220,0:00:19.280
This is my auntie.

0:00:19.280,0:00:26.400
I'm here today to testify of the goodness of God in my life through the ministration of the new Morning Water.

0:00:26.400,0:00:32.300
On the fateful day, I woke up in the morning.

0:00:32.300,0:00:37.680
I went out for my daily job.

0:00:37.680,0:00:44.520
In the evening, I came home around midnight.

0:00:44.520,0:00:48.920
Upon getting to my street, I was tired.

0:00:48.920,0:00:51.400
So I could not reach my house.

0:00:51.400,0:00:58.040
I parked near my house for me to rest.

0:00:58.040,0:01:03.420
Before I knew it, unknown gunmen attacked me.

0:01:03.420,0:01:06.700
That is the only thing I know.

0:01:06.700,0:01:11.900
The next thing, I found myself somewhere - somewhere I didn't know.

0:01:11.900,0:01:18.080
The person I saw where I found myself was my late dad who died many years ago.

0:01:18.080,0:01:22.740
He now called me for me to come.

0:01:22.740,0:01:28.580
It took a first, second step to reach where he was.

0:01:28.580,0:01:33.300
Children of God, I saw the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.

0:01:33.300,0:01:39.760
Mr Damian, Friend & Family
New Morning Water Testimony

0:01:39.760,0:01:45.180
He now called me to come back.

0:01:45.180,0:01:48.500
I now turned and followed him.

0:01:48.500,0:01:54.040
So when I was going with him, I turned to look at my father again.

0:01:54.040,0:01:56.040
I did not see him.

0:01:56.040,0:02:03.200
That was how I woke up and I found in the hospital.

0:02:03.200,0:02:05.760
I now saw my friend.

0:02:05.760,0:02:09.860
I asked him, "Where are we? Where am I? What are we doing here?

0:02:09.860,0:02:11.680
I'm just closing from work".

0:02:11.680,0:02:15.540
He then laughed and told me that I was attacked.

0:02:15.540,0:02:18.120
My name is Philip. I'm from Ghana.

0:02:18.120,0:02:21.120
The man beside me is my friend Damian.

0:02:21.120,0:02:25.060
He is an Uber driver, and that is the mum and auntie.

0:02:25.060,0:02:30.120
Actually, I'm a business man. Most of the time, I come here to Lagos to do importation.

0:02:30.120,0:02:34.640
Any time I come, I call him; he is the one that normally takes me around.

0:02:34.640,0:02:38.500
So this fateful day, I came on the 10th of August.

0:02:38.500,0:02:43.720
I was in the hotel room and received a phone call around 3 to 4 am in the morning

0:02:43.720,0:02:46.380
that my friend was dead and I was like, "How?"

0:02:46.380,0:02:49.600
The person who called indicated that my friend was dead.

0:02:49.600,0:02:52.360
They took him to the hospital.

0:02:52.360,0:02:55.680
So I rushed to the general hospital.

0:02:55.680,0:03:00.940
On getting there, I realised that he was in a pool of blood.

0:03:00.940,0:03:07.300
According to those who saw him at the beginning, he was attacked by armed robbers.

0:03:07.300,0:03:10.300
They beat him and thought he was dead.

0:03:10.300,0:03:13.580
They threw him into the dustbin and left him there.

0:03:13.580,0:03:16.900
It was the security man that was passing by who knew where he was

0:03:16.900,0:03:18.900
and they found him and took him to the hospital.

0:03:18.900,0:03:21.740
Immediately the doctor asked me whether I was a family member.

0:03:21.740,0:03:26.600
I said, "No, I'm a friend. But if there are any bills, I'm ready to pay for him".

0:03:26.600,0:03:30.620
The doctor said, "Ok, if that is the case, they could not do anything over there".

0:03:30.620,0:03:36.140
So we had to transfer him to Lagos University Teaching Hospital.

0:03:36.140,0:03:40.700
We took him there. On getting there, they rushed him to the emergency ward.

0:03:40.700,0:03:43.700
When the doctors came - there were many of them -

0:03:43.700,0:03:47.320
first of all, the ones who were going to operate the head.

0:03:47.320,0:03:49.320
He was in coma at that time.

0:03:49.320,0:03:52.100
He could not see anything, he could not breathe, nothing - he was dead.

0:03:52.100,0:03:54.860
Let me put it that way: He was dead.

0:03:54.860,0:03:59.740
They were going to operate the head, eyes and teeth.

0:03:59.740,0:04:02.640
They were going to look for three different specialists -

0:04:02.640,0:04:07.700
the dentist, the one for the head and the one for the eyes.

0:04:07.700,0:04:15.140
At that time, they told me that the bills would be at least 2.5 before they could take care of him.

0:04:15.140,0:04:19.620
Even if he comes back, he will not be a normal person again.

0:04:19.620,0:04:24.160
So I was like, "Oh. This one - how am I going to handle this?"

0:04:24.160,0:04:28.700
Then, I didn't know any of his family members and everything relied on me.

0:04:28.700,0:04:31.780
I could not go anywhere; I had to stay in the hospital with him.

0:04:31.780,0:04:33.540
I said, "Okay. I will take it upon myself.

0:04:33.540,0:04:37.880
Any bill, even if it takes me to sell everything I have, I'm ready to do it to take care of him".

0:04:37.880,0:04:45.860
Mr Philip & Friend
New Morning Water Testimony

0:04:45.860,0:04:54.040
The doctor gave me a list of things they are going to buy for the first operation.

0:04:54.040,0:04:57.280
They wanted to do the head first.

0:04:57.280,0:05:02.280
I remembered that I had the Morning Water which the man of God had given to me.

0:05:02.280,0:05:07.600
I had then already withdrawn the money; I was having the money in my bag.

0:05:07.600,0:05:11.500
But I said, "No, let me prolong them a bit and see what will happen

0:05:11.500,0:05:14.240
because through the Morning Water, I know God can do something".

0:05:14.240,0:05:19.800
Mr Philip & Friend
New Morning Water Testimony

0:05:19.800,0:05:22.260
So I decided to prolong the doctors.

0:05:22.260,0:05:26.720
When they asked me to bring the money or buy something, I told them I didn't have money.

0:05:26.720,0:05:28.560
It was on a Friday.

0:05:28.560,0:05:34.060
When they told me to bring the money for payment or buy the items they told me to buy,

0:05:34.060,0:05:38.940
I told them that I didn't have money - just to prolong them.

0:05:38.940,0:05:41.760
So through that, I was ministering the Morning Water on him.

0:05:41.760,0:05:47.580
I administered the Morning Water first on the head and the eyes after the three days.

0:05:47.580,0:05:50.320
Suddenly, he just woke up.

0:05:50.320,0:05:55.580
Shall we put our hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:05:55.580,0:05:58.780
You mean, your friend that was in coma -

0:05:58.780,0:06:04.560
when you started ministering the Morning Water on him, that was how he came back to life.

0:06:04.560,0:06:06.440
That was how he just came back.

0:06:06.440,0:06:10.360
And he came back with a word, saying, "This is sweet".

0:06:10.360,0:06:13.540
after I had ministered the Morning Water into the mouth.

0:06:13.540,0:06:16.280
He said, "This is sweet. Minister more; put more".

0:06:16.280,0:06:17.400
I put more; I kept on ministering...

0:06:17.400,0:06:20.900
Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:06:20.900,0:06:24.940
Testimony Time

0:06:24.940,0:06:30.600
They even used him for a case study whereby all the students around came -

0:06:30.600,0:06:34.200
just to use him as a case study to teach the students.

0:06:34.200,0:06:40.480
I knew this man was condemned already for them to use him as a case study.

0:06:40.480,0:06:44.420
You are no longer a human being.

0:06:44.420,0:06:49.600
They said that on Monday morning, they were going to take him to the theatre.

0:06:49.600,0:06:51.420
I said, "Okay".

0:06:51.420,0:06:54.860
Early Monday morning when they came - the three of them, all the specialists -

0:06:54.860,0:06:56.920
when they came, the first one looked at the head

0:06:56.920,0:07:00.600
and he said, "Wow. We don't need any surgery again".

0:07:00.600,0:07:08.440
Testimony Time

0:07:08.440,0:07:14.420
Immediately, he took pen and paper and wrote, "We are discharging him on your part".

0:07:14.420,0:07:20.580
So the one for the eyes came and said, "Hm, your friend is healed.

0:07:20.580,0:07:25.080
The eyes will be clear by itself so we don't need to do anything again".

0:07:25.080,0:07:29.560
Mr Philip & Friend
New Morning Water Testimony

0:07:29.560,0:07:32.860
And he also discharged him on his side.

0:07:32.860,0:07:34.860
Remaining the dentist.

0:07:34.860,0:07:39.560
Initially, the dentist told me that they were going to use 16 screws -

0:07:39.560,0:07:45.120
both from here - down, and from here - down to hold the teeth.

0:07:45.120,0:07:47.740
And each one is 15,000 Naira.

0:07:47.740,0:07:53.180
And then they were going to use something called 'German anchor'.

0:07:53.180,0:07:56.200
I don't know - medical whatever.

0:07:56.200,0:08:02.940
Each one they were going to use - 10 of them - and each one is 8,000 Naira.

0:08:02.940,0:08:06.460
So the doctor looked at him - that was the dentist - after the other two had discharged him.

0:08:06.460,0:08:12.160
That one looked at him and said, "No, I won't need all the screws again.

0:08:12.160,0:08:17.960
All what I need to do is a simple and minor operation that will not cost much".

0:08:17.960,0:08:24.100
Wow. Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:08:24.100,0:08:26.740
Ok, brother. Can I ask you a question?

0:08:26.740,0:08:30.000
Why do you think all these specialists were like -

0:08:30.000,0:08:32.680
they had already told you they were going to do the operation;

0:08:32.680,0:08:35.080
it would take months for him to recover -

0:08:35.080,0:08:38.080
why did they suddenly change and say, they were not doing it?

0:08:38.080,0:08:40.700
Because I continued ministering the Morning Water.

0:08:40.700,0:08:44.680
And he started healing, even without doing the operation.

0:08:44.680,0:08:45.780
Without doing the operation.

0:08:45.780,0:08:52.120
To God be glory. Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

0:08:52.120,0:08:57.220
Later on, they took him - that is, the dentist took him to the theatre

0:08:57.220,0:09:05.380
just to fix the teeth with a 'German anchor'.

0:09:05.380,0:09:10.620
And he told me it was going to take six months for him to recover.

0:09:10.620,0:09:15.100
In these six months, he would not eat anything - only liquid.

0:09:15.100,0:09:16.900
He was in the hospital.

0:09:16.900,0:09:20.000
After he came back, I continued ministering the Morning Water.

0:09:20.000,0:09:22.540
Anything they said we should give him - medication and everything -

0:09:22.540,0:09:26.100
I ministered the Morning Water in it and I gave it to him through a straw

0:09:26.100,0:09:28.900
because then, he could not open the mouth.

0:09:28.900,0:09:35.520
Three days - I mean, three days - the doctor came back, checked him

0:09:35.520,0:09:38.020
and said, "This thing needs to be removed.

0:09:38.020,0:09:42.200
That the teeth are strong enough for him to chew bones".

0:09:42.200,0:09:49.320
Testimony Time

0:09:49.320,0:09:52.960
And that was when he was discharged.

0:09:52.960,0:09:56.780
Six months turned to six days.

0:09:56.780,0:10:04.300
Wow. Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:10:04.300,0:10:07.360
From there, I got to know where the mother was

0:10:07.360,0:10:12.560
so I decided to send transportation for the mother and the sister to come and help him

0:10:12.560,0:10:14.700
because then, I could not do so many things.

0:10:14.700,0:10:19.860
That was when I sent the transportation to the family and they came down.

0:10:19.860,0:10:23.440
They are now in charge by taking care of him.

0:10:23.440,0:10:26.340
Ok, we can see a board beside our brother.

0:10:26.340,0:10:29.880
Can you tell us - what are the pictures on the board that we are looking at.

0:10:29.880,0:10:34.800
Mr Philip & Friend
New Morning Water Testimony

0:10:34.800,0:10:38.320
As you can see, this is when they picked him from the dustbin.

0:10:38.320,0:10:47.560
There was no car to take him in so they used a condemned bus that was around to pick him.

0:10:47.560,0:10:49.760
This one - he was gone already.

0:10:49.760,0:10:53.080
This was when we took him to the general hospital.

0:10:53.080,0:10:57.500
This one - he was dead and gone.

0:10:57.500,0:11:00.500
The doctors referred us as they could not do anything about it.

0:11:00.500,0:11:02.080
That we should go to LUTE (Lagos University Teaching Hospital).

0:11:02.080,0:11:06.580
And here is when he was still in coma in the theatre at LUTE.

0:11:06.580,0:11:08.580
You can see the eyes.

0:11:08.580,0:11:11.580
Both of the eyes were condemned.

0:11:11.580,0:11:15.040
And this was after the surgery.

0:11:15.040,0:11:16.740
Look at what they put in the mouth.

0:11:16.740,0:11:19.620
When they put this in your mouth, can you be a human being again?

0:11:19.620,0:11:22.020
This was what they put in the mouth.

0:11:22.020,0:11:25.160
It took three days to remove them.

0:11:25.160,0:11:28.280
And here is what they used to hit the head.

0:11:28.280,0:11:30.540
And you can imagine, you are just seeing this side.

0:11:30.540,0:11:35.340
But the head like this - down was cracked.

0:11:35.340,0:11:37.640
It cracked down.

0:11:37.640,0:11:39.640
So they wanted to fix the whole thing.

0:11:39.640,0:11:48.220
But through the ministration of the Morning Water, all this thing was healed within three days.

0:11:48.220,0:11:55.700
Put your hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:11:55.700,0:11:58.980
The same yesterday, today and forever!

0:11:58.980,0:12:03.100
Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!

0:12:03.100,0:12:04.400
Wow.

0:12:04.400,0:12:10.120
Indeed, our God is a miraculous God.

0:12:10.120,0:12:14.340
To God be the glory. Thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in the life of our brother,

0:12:14.340,0:12:18.960
restoring him back to life; someone that could have been a dead person.

0:12:18.960,0:12:24.400
But through the medium of the New Morning Water, God Almighty restored him back to life.

0:12:24.400,0:12:28.020
There was something I forgot - whilst ministering the Morning Water.

0:12:28.020,0:12:32.900
There was a man - an elderly man - who was suffering from Parkinson.

0:12:32.900,0:12:36.100
He was shaking; you would see him shaking on the bed.

0:12:36.100,0:12:41.300
Immediately I ministered the Morning Water, the elderly man called me at my back and said,

0:12:41.300,0:12:45.360
"My son, please, is it the Morning Water from Prophet T.B. Joshua?"

0:12:45.360,0:12:46.700
I said, "Daddy, please, yes".

0:12:46.700,0:12:48.620
He said, "Can you minister it to me".

0:12:48.620,0:12:52.680
I handed the whole bottle to him, "Daddy, please take and minister it upon yourself".

0:12:52.680,0:12:55.480
And he did. The following day, they discharged him.

0:12:55.480,0:13:04.760
Testimony Time

0:13:04.760,0:13:07.000
Wow. To God be the glory.

0:13:07.000,0:13:09.980
So that means that the New Morning Water was not only for your brother.

0:13:09.980,0:13:12.040
It was also for everyone.

0:13:12.040,0:13:13.160
For everyone.

0:13:13.160,0:13:19.100
Wow. We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your life and the life of our brother.

0:13:19.100,0:13:25.000
So now tell us, brother - what can you say concerning this New Morning Water?

0:13:25.000,0:13:31.760
The New Morning Water is the medium God has given us freely to heal, save and deliver.

Whatever problem you are suffering from, be it HIV, hypertension,

0:13:37.300,0:13:39.880
Hepatitis B, whatever being the case -

0:13:39.880,0:13:43.300
just use a drop of it and you will be whole.

0:13:43.300,0:13:49.060
You will be free, in Jesus' name.

When he was in the hospital, I remembered that I needed to go back to the police station

0:13:53.280,0:13:56.600
and report the case because then, there were no family members around.

0:13:56.600,0:13:59.620
On getting to the police station, I saw the car parked there.

0:13:59.620,0:14:01.160
So I asked, "How come?"

0:14:01.160,0:14:03.760
They said, "The same morning they recovered the car -

0:14:03.760,0:14:06.960
when the armed robbers were trying to use the car to rob somewhere,

0:14:06.960,0:14:10.540
they got them and recovered the car immediately that morning".

0:14:10.540,0:14:12.540
Wow. To God be the glory.

0:14:12.540,0:14:18.040
Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!

0:14:18.040,0:14:22.960
So not only did God heal him and restore him back to life,

0:14:22.960,0:14:26.640
his means of livelihood that could have been taken away from him,

0:14:26.640,0:14:29.320
God also brought it back to him.

0:14:29.320,0:14:32.980
Wow. We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your lives.

0:14:32.980,0:14:36.160
My brothers and sisters, I was dead; I was gone.

0:14:36.160,0:14:38.160
I did not know what was happening.

0:14:38.160,0:14:41.960
But God brought me back to life through this Morning Water.

My advice to the viewers, especially the taxi drivers:

0:14:53.000,0:14:57.400
Every time you are going out in the morning,

0:14:57.400,0:15:02.620
ask God, pray to God, tell Him to take over your life,

0:15:02.620,0:15:06.860
tell Him to lead you and bring you back safely

0:15:06.860,0:15:10.360
because without Jesus, I would not be alive today.

0:15:10.360,0:15:17.220
To my brothers and sisters, let us ask from God first, any time we are going out.

0:15:17.220,0:15:18.260
Thank you.

0:15:18.260,0:15:22.060
Thank you very much for that wonderful advice.

0:15:22.060,0:15:26.400
Our brother is telling us that we should involve God in everything that we do,

0:15:26.400,0:15:29.420
put God first in everything that you do

0:15:29.420,0:15:35.960
because the greatest decision you can make in life is to put God first in everything you do.

0:15:35.960,0:15:38.560
We also want to advise you, our brother,

0:15:38.560,0:15:43.100
as God has done this for you, make sure you make God's Word the standard for your life

0:15:43.100,0:15:46.160
and live your life in tune with God's Word

0:15:46.160,0:15:49.820
so it shall continue to be well with you, in Jesus' name.

0:15:49.820,0:15:50.700
Amen.
