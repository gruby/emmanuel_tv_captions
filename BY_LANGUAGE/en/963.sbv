The people standing beside me:

0:00:16.140,0:00:19.660
this is my sister,

0:00:19.660,0:00:25.800
these are my brothers - all of them are my brothers.

0:00:25.800,0:00:29.240
The last one is the PRO of the community.

0:00:29.240,0:00:34.940
Amen.
Lets clap for Jesus Christ!

0:00:34.940,0:00:44.980
My testimony goes like this: in January 2016, I was shot.

0:00:44.980,0:00:54.420
After they shot me, they shot others â€“ 10 people in number.

0:00:54.420,0:01:02.380
They shot me in back of my head.

0:01:02.380,0:01:14.740
The Navy there rushed me to Yenagoa and from there, to Abuja.

0:01:14.740,0:01:28.000
I was in a state of coma in a hospital, for three weeks.

0:01:28.000,0:01:33.100
My people thought I had died; everybody lost hope.

0:01:33.100,0:01:40.380
It was even posted on the internet that I deserved to die!

0:01:40.380,0:01:46.440
But, by the special grace of God I made it through!

0:01:46.440,0:01:51.280
Clap for Jesus!

0:01:51.280,0:02:08.300
I was with the Anointed Sticker when they shot me; it was close to my body.

0:02:08.300,0:02:13.420
People who are familiar with AK 47 will know that

0:02:13.420,0:02:20.660
if somebody shoots you in the head with one, you will die -

0:02:20.660,0:02:25.580
but by the special grace of God, I lived.

After I made it through the coma, the doctors said they could not remove the bullet from my head.

0:02:47.260,0:03:01.780
I was referred to India after undergoing three surgeries in Abuja that did not work.

0:03:01.780,0:03:08.940
Then, I could not move so they bought a wheelchair for me; I could not do anything.

0:03:08.940,0:03:13.140
It was then, they referred me to India.

0:03:13.140,0:03:18.780
After they referred me to India, they discharged me to a hotel;

0:03:18.780,0:03:23.360
in the hotel, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying on Emmanuel TV.

0:03:23.360,0:03:25.880
While you were in the hotel you were watching Emmanuel TV?

0:03:25.880,0:03:26.580
Yes.

0:03:26.580,0:03:27.800
And you saw man of God praying?

0:03:27.800,0:03:34.680
Yes, my faith was built up and I said that I wanted to touch the television.

0:03:34.680,0:03:38.640
I asked those around to help me and they did.

0:03:38.640,0:03:47.980
When I placed my hand on the television and prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua -

0:03:47.980,0:03:53.040
my brothers and sisters, wonders have not come to an end!

0:03:57.860,0:04:02.820
After the prayer, I began to vomit.

0:04:02.820,0:04:09.100
I vomited anything I put in my mouth.

0:04:09.100,0:04:12.440
My people were scared.

0:04:12.440,0:04:20.040
The bullet that the doctors could not remove came out by itself!

0:04:20.040,0:04:27.280
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:04:27.280,0:04:29.500
Our Lord is good.

0:04:29.500,0:04:30.980
You've heard a wonderful testimony.

0:04:30.980,0:04:34.800
Our brother still has a lot to say, but he is so exited at this moment...

0:04:34.800,0:04:39.860
This is the bullet - you can see it on the board.

0:04:39.860,0:04:41.720
This is my head.

0:04:41.720,0:04:45.480
This is exactly the spot the bullet came from on its own?

0:04:45.480,0:04:46.160
Yes.

0:04:46.160,0:04:52.060
You had three operations to have the bullet removed - all to no avail?

0:04:52.060,0:04:57.660
But after you prayed along with man of God on Emmanuel TV the bullet came out on its own?

0:04:57.660,0:04:58.200
Yes.

0:04:58.200,0:05:04.220
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:05:04.220,0:05:07.560
This is me on the photo.

0:05:07.560,0:05:09.700
One moment, sir.

0:05:09.700,0:05:11.660
This was at the time you were hospitalized?

0:05:11.660,0:05:18.260
Yes, this photo was taken when I was hospitalized in Abuja.

0:05:18.260,0:05:23.160
While I was on the wheelchair, I was wondering what would I do.

0:05:23.160,0:05:33.640
This was the first miracle - God was to finish what He had begun.

0:05:33.640,0:05:42.940
I asked my sister to bring me to Lagos and she did.

0:05:42.940,0:05:56.760
So, when I came I said, "God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, You are the One who created me -

0:05:56.760,0:06:00.980
not with a wheelchair; a wheelchair is not my portion."

0:06:00.980,0:06:10.440
I stood up and I told my sister to give the hospital their wheelchair back.

0:06:10.440,0:06:14.920

He said that after he had prayed along with the man of God on Emmanuel TV, the bullet came out by itself,

0:06:20.140,0:06:22.180
without any surgical operation.

0:06:22.180,0:06:26.960
He flew to Lagos but because of the crowd he could not enter the church.

0:06:26.960,0:06:30.720
While the man of God was praying, he prayed along with him at the auditorium.

0:06:30.720,0:06:35.660
Then he said to God, "This wheelchair is not for me. I want to get out of this wheelchair and walk."

0:06:35.660,0:06:37.420
That is how the miracle happened.

0:06:37.420,0:06:41.400
Since then he is walking on his legs without using the wheelchair.

0:06:41.400,0:06:47.420
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God.

0:06:47.420,0:06:55.780
Now, for the benefit of the listeners, we want you to turn your head and show us the spot where the bullet was.

0:06:55.780,0:06:59.640
This is the spot.

0:06:59.640,0:07:05.300
When somebody shoots you in the head, you will die.

0:07:05.300,0:07:06.780
But I made it.

0:07:06.780,0:07:09.000
To God be the glory.

0:07:09.000,0:07:14.460
We rejoice with you greatly for having you rescued from the shackles of death.

0:07:14.460,0:07:19.540
Through your prayer while watching Emmanuel TV, right now you are healed and healthy.

0:07:19.540,0:07:23.920
Now, could you tell us - what word of advice you have for those who are listening to you,

0:07:23.920,0:07:30.040
concerning what the Lord Jesus Christ can do because distance is not a barrier.

0:07:30.040,0:07:37.320
People of God: what you are hearing is real.

0:07:37.320,0:07:40.480
What I want to say is:

0:07:40.480,0:07:54.980
2 Kings 2:19-21 says the land was glittering, the people said the land was pleasant

0:07:54.980,0:07:58.800
but the water is bad and the land is barren.

0:07:58.800,0:08:03.160
Elisha healed the land with salt.

0:08:03.160,0:08:10.640
The man of God has the power to heal our land with the Word.

Now, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.

0:08:20.960,0:08:28.340
We certainly rejoice with you that the Lord has bestowed upon you the healing.

0:08:28.340,0:08:33.820
As you go and make His Word the standard for your life, we pray that your miracle remain permanent,

0:08:33.820,0:08:34.940
in Jesus' name.
