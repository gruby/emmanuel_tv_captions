PROPHECY TIME

0:00:03.980,0:00:08.680
There Is a woman: You have put on a pad.

0:00:08.680,0:00:11.600
It is not your period.

0:00:11.600,0:00:13.960
You have been like that for some time now.

0:00:13.960,0:00:18.060
Sometimes when you dont have money, you put on a rag,

0:00:18.060,0:00:21.020
just to stop whatever is coming out of your body.

0:00:21.020,0:00:23.880
It is no longer just blood.

0:00:23.880,0:00:26.300
Your system is damaged.

0:00:26.300,0:00:30.800
So please, come out. Jesus loves you.

0:00:30.800,0:00:33.340
You know Jesus can stop it.

0:00:33.340,0:00:36.740
Remember the woman with the issue of blood.

0:00:36.740,0:00:39.760
So come out and enjoy the grace.

0:00:39.760,0:00:41.660
In Jesus' mighty name.

0:00:41.660,0:00:46.660
Surprised by hearing her case spoken about, in the midst of a large congregation,

0:00:46.660,0:00:51.920
this lady comes forward, knowing that the solution to her embarassing problem had come.

0:00:51.920,0:00:54.900
Feeling the presence of God, she takes a deep breath

0:00:54.900,0:00:58.400
as she prepares herself for what is to come.

0:00:58.400,0:01:01.080
Man of God, I am the woman.

0:01:01.080,0:01:04.820
I'm bleeding. After my period I am still bleeding very heavily.

0:01:04.820,0:01:08.300
I'm still wearing a lot of pads because of that.

0:01:08.300,0:01:12.300
I am bleeding very heavily right now and I am not in my period.

0:01:12.300,0:01:18.080
I'm wearing a lot of pads because of that situation right now.

0:01:18.080,0:01:21.780
After the lady confirmed the prophecy to be a 100% percent true,

0:01:21.780,0:01:25.400
Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her and deliverance begins.

0:01:25.400,0:01:26.840
In the name of Jesus Christ!

0:01:26.840,0:01:31.820
She clutches her stomach as a spiritual operation takes place.

0:01:31.820,0:01:36.720
The darkness that caused her to continually bleed is dispelled by God's great light.

0:01:36.720,0:01:38.620
Your back on the floor!

0:01:47.140,0:01:51.160
So that is the end of your bleeding.

0:01:57.940,0:02:03.660
Thank You, Jesus.

0:02:03.660,0:02:06.080
Thank You, my daughter is free.

0:02:06.080,0:02:09.820
Thank You, Jesus!

0:02:09.820,0:02:15.880
With gratitude and adoration to God, the lady's mother raises her hands to the Most High

0:02:15.880,0:02:18.140
for setting her daughter free at last,

0:02:18.140,0:02:22.240
delivering her from the burden of constant bleeding for many years.

0:02:22.900,0:02:26.340
TESTIMONY TIME

0:02:26.340,0:02:29.180
Praise the Lord!

0:02:29.180,0:02:31.640
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:02:31.640,0:02:32.600
Bless the Lord.

0:02:32.600,0:02:35.780
My name is Lianna Douglas.

0:02:35.780,0:02:39.900
I am from Trinidad and Tobago.

0:02:39.900,0:02:47.020
Next to me are my mother Elvira Fifield and my two sisters Abigail and Shanel.

0:02:47.020,0:02:49.540
We were here last Sunday.

0:02:49.540,0:02:52.600
I was having an issue of bleeding.

0:02:52.600,0:02:54.500
Extreme bleeding.

0:02:54.500,0:02:58.180
At times it was very embarrassing for me.

0:02:58.180,0:03:04.180
When the prophecy was given by the Man of God, I was so shocked

0:03:04.180,0:03:10.000
because we had been watching Emmanuel TV for so long, seeing all these miracles.

0:03:10.000,0:03:18.600
Now I'm actually in The SCOAN and I received this prophecy.

0:03:18.600,0:03:21.620
I was stunned, I froze.

0:03:21.620,0:03:23.240
I couldn't believe it was me.

0:03:23.240,0:03:29.200
God really looked down to heal me.

0:03:29.200,0:03:34.900
When I came forward, the Man of God did not touch me.

0:03:34.900,0:03:38.080
He just pointed his hand towards me.

0:03:38.080,0:03:43.720
I felt the power of God touch my womb.

0:03:43.720,0:03:50.040
It was as though a plunger was pulling at my womb.

0:03:50.040,0:03:54.600
It was like a suction pulling at my womb.

0:03:54.600,0:03:59.760
Then, I just fell to the floor under the power of God.

0:03:59.760,0:04:03.640
Saints of God, immediately that bleeding stopped.

0:04:03.640,0:04:10.780
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:04:10.780,0:04:13.580
Since then I feel much better.

0:04:13.580,0:04:17.280
Everybody says that I look much better.

0:04:17.280,0:04:22.520
I looked at myself in the mirror and realised that I look much better. I feel better.

0:04:22.520,0:04:24.520
And I'm improving daily.

0:04:24.520,0:04:32.340
My stomach was very bulky and firm because I had multiple fibroids.

0:04:32.340,0:04:35.880
My stomach was firm and very bulky.

0:04:35.880,0:04:40.980
Since then it is very soft and pliable.

0:04:40.980,0:04:42.440
Very soft.

0:04:42.440,0:04:45.780
And now I am totally free!

0:04:52.980,0:04:55.860
My name is Elvira Fifield.

0:04:55.860,0:05:00.080
My husband and I are pastors in the island of Trinidad and Tobago.

0:05:00.080,0:05:02.680
These are my three daughters.

0:05:02.680,0:05:06.460
We thank God for being here. Praise the Lord!

0:05:06.460,0:05:10.740
Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:05:10.740,0:05:18.660
Before we came to this country, my daughter was bleeding profusely.

0:05:18.660,0:05:23.760
It was so bad that the doctors told her that they didnt want her to travel.

0:05:23.760,0:05:27.120
Her blood count was very low.

0:05:27.120,0:05:29.960
She would be tense and nervous.

0:05:29.960,0:05:32.120
She would be palpating.

0:05:32.120,0:05:35.600
On her job, she would have problems.

0:05:35.600,0:05:38.900
The bleeding was so intense.

0:05:38.900,0:05:48.180
When we got here last Sunday, like the woman with the issue of blood, nobody knew us.

0:05:48.180,0:05:52.980
We knew no one but God saw us.

0:05:52.980,0:06:02.000
Lianna's Mother & Family - Prophecy Testimony

0:06:02.000,0:06:09.700
The Man of God called my daughter out - it had to be God.

0:06:09.700,0:06:15.240
I sat there and said, "Who knows us here, Lord? What will we do?"

0:06:15.240,0:06:20.980
But we put a demand on the anointing that was in the Man of God.

0:06:20.980,0:06:25.720
The SCOAN Sunday Service

0:06:25.720,0:06:32.280
When he made that call, it was so shocking!

0:06:32.280,0:06:36.580
I was looking forward to it but it was a unique thing.

0:06:36.580,0:06:43.240
When he made that call, I said, "Jesus, you have seen her!"

0:06:43.240,0:06:45.580
She walked to the front.

0:06:45.580,0:06:47.260
He didn't touch her.

0:06:47.260,0:06:50.020
He didn't even come close to her.

0:06:50.020,0:06:56.080
But the power of God penetrated her inner being.

0:06:56.080,0:07:01.460
When she got up and I looked at her, she said, "Mom, it is gone!"

0:07:01.460,0:07:03.340
It was the last.

0:07:03.340,0:07:08.580
It is because of the power of the Holy Ghost in the Prophet of God.

0:07:08.580,0:07:11.880
Thank God for Jesus Christ!

0:07:11.880,0:07:16.440
Thank God for a prophet who has made himself available

0:07:16.440,0:07:21.800
so that God could use him to be a blessing to the world.

0:07:21.800,0:07:23.460
Glory to God!

0:07:23.460,0:07:25.300
Thank You, Jesus.

0:07:42.200,0:07:51.780
I came to Nigeria purposely to The SCOAN.

0:07:51.780,0:07:56.500
I thank God that He allowed us to reach here safely.

0:07:56.500,0:08:03.440
My three girls and I meant business: We were going to find this church and we are here!

0:08:03.440,0:08:08.640
Thank God for Jesus that we received more than what we came for.

Man of God, I would like to sing a song to thank God for what He has done for me.

0:08:19.020,0:08:25.620
Lord, how are they increased that trouble me

0:08:25.620,0:08:32.180
Many are they that rise up against me

0:08:32.180,0:08:39.000
Many there be which say of my soul,

0:08:39.000,0:08:45.340
There is no help for Her in God

0:08:45.340,0:08:52.180
But Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me

0:08:52.180,0:08:59.020
My glory, You lift mine head

0:08:59.020,0:09:05.740
But Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me
