0:00:00.000,0:00:03.740
My name is Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna from Anambra state, Nigeria.

0:00:03.740,0:00:06.700
The person standing beside
 me is my very good friend.

0:00:09.000,0:00:10.920
My testimony goes like this.

0:00:13.580,0:00:17.600
Starting from 2013, I felt sick

0:00:19.340,0:00:23.120
I thought it was Malaria, I started treating malaria.

0:00:24.480,0:00:28.400
I was treating malaria and I saw
 myself going down critically.

0:00:28.400,0:00:31.080
Until the company I was working
 for asked me to go home,

0:00:31.080,0:00:33.320
and check what the problem was with my health.

0:00:34.100,0:00:36.020
I said, "Okay!" and went home

0:00:37.000,0:00:38.520
I came back and told them its malaria

0:00:38.520,0:00:39.500
that am treating it.

0:00:39.500,0:00:40.120
They said, "Okay!"

0:00:40.180,0:00:43.500
To an extend that I started going down

0:00:43.680,0:00:45.700
that I couldn't move -  nothing.

0:00:45.700,0:00:48.220
And they said, " Man go home! 
and take care of yourself"

0:00:48.220,0:00:53.420
I went home, I went to he hospital and
 I was diagnosed of chronic Hepatitis B

0:00:53.780,0:00:56.100
alongside inflamed appendicitis

0:00:58.040,0:01:01.980
I didn't discover it on time,
 It was up to a year before I discover it.

0:01:02.480,0:01:06.560
It had gone far beyond every fiber of my being.

0:01:06.560,0:01:08.080
It had eaten up my livers

0:01:09.220,0:01:10.020
I was dying.

0:01:11.160,0:01:13.000
I thought its something money can do,

0:01:13.000,0:01:14.740
I thought money could buy my life back.

0:01:15.420,0:01:17.000
I started visiting hospitals

0:01:17.720,0:01:22.380
So many hospitals tried, they kept referring
 me from one hospital to another.

0:01:22.380,0:01:25.180
To an extend that hospitals started rejecting me.

0:01:25.180,0:01:28.220
When I went to hospitals, they 
didn't even admit me any longer.

0:01:28.220,0:01:30.482
They look at me, they look at my report and say,

0:01:30.482,0:01:33.120
"young man we cant help you 
please go to another hospital."

0:01:33.120,0:01:35.800
We started tolling round hospital to hospital

0:01:35.840,0:01:38.380
my dad, my brother, everybody running around.

0:01:38.740,0:01:41.540
To an extend that I become critically down

0:01:41.640,0:01:43.320
If you saw me, you could ran away

0:01:43.320,0:01:47.400
I became like a skeleton I couldn't talk, eat or move

0:01:47.500,0:01:49.300
I was just lying down there.

0:01:51.480,0:01:53.540
Everybody started running away from me

0:01:53.540,0:01:56.800
because It was during the time of the outbreak of Ebola.

0:01:57.680,0:01:59.477
So everybody started running away from me,

0:01:59.477,0:02:01.360
to an extend that my immediate elder brother

0:02:01.540,0:02:03.700
said that he doesn't want to die.

0:02:03.700,0:02:06.580
That he is leaving home and that he is leaving town.

0:02:06.580,0:02:08.340
that he doesn't want to get infected

0:02:08.460,0:02:09.640
He ran away too.

0:02:11.060,0:02:15.220
It went on and on, I kept on pressing
 from hospital to hospital.

0:02:15.280,0:02:18.620
Until I went with my dad to one 
hospital and the doctor said,

0:02:18.620,0:02:21.300
"young man I want to tell you something, 
where is your dad?"

0:02:21.420,0:02:22.220
I said, "this is my dad."

0:02:22.460,0:02:27.780
He said, "Father, take your son back
 home, no doctor can help this guy,

0:02:27.780,0:02:32.180
medically, there is no way for him, he is
 just standing next to his grave.

0:02:32.220,0:02:34.060
We cant do anything for him.

0:02:34.120,0:02:36.040
We cannot even operate on him

0:02:36.420,0:02:39.560
due to the chronic hepatitis B he is having and

0:02:39.560,0:02:41.980
the appendices in him is already inflamed."

0:02:42.620,0:02:44.380
He said that If they operate on me

0:02:44.380,0:02:46.780
they fear that I was not going to make

0:02:48.560,0:02:50.640
I gave them my consent that they 
should do it,

0:02:50.920,0:02:53.260
that if anything happened there was no problem.

0:02:53.900,0:02:57.440
The doctor said that he doesn't 
think anybody could do that,

0:02:57.440,0:02:59.720
that no doctor wants to have 
anybody's blood on his hand.

0:03:00.100,0:03:04.440
That I should go home, if I know the God that 
I am serving I should run to him

0:03:04.540,0:03:06.000
and pray to him.

0:03:06.520,0:03:10.029
Hepatitis B according to the doctors, they said that

0:03:10.029,0:03:13.660
it is an ailment that is worst than HIV.

0:03:14.480,0:03:18.200
The doctor said, that Its better
 I have HIV than I have Hepatitis B.

0:03:18.220,0:03:22.580
And it was not just Hepatitis B,
 it is a chronic Hepatitis B.

0:03:23.560,0:03:27.020
During the time I was going around in hospital

0:03:27.420,0:03:31.620
When I got to some hospitals 
so many doctors were seeing me and scream

0:03:31.660,0:03:32.540
and run away.

0:03:33.080,0:03:36.680
Some of them were saying, "This guy!
 I don't think this guy can make it.

0:03:37.080,0:03:41.400
And I was refereed to a specialist
 at Enugu teaching Hospital

0:03:41.960,0:03:43.880
I got there and I met this lady

0:03:44.180,0:03:45.400
and I said, "Excuse me madam,"

0:03:45.560,0:03:48.280
She turned around and saw me, she scream, "Jesus!"

0:03:48.360,0:03:49.240
and run away.

0:03:49.900,0:03:53.020
I felt so bad, I had to go back home

0:03:53.020,0:03:55.860
and I decided never to go back to hospital again.

0:03:56.180,0:04:00.980
If you saw me then, I don't  think 
you would want to even stand close to me.

0:04:01.740,0:04:04.920
I was like a corpse, I was like a skeleton.

0:04:05.560,0:04:09.480
If you saw me even in clothes, 
my bones were still showing it.

0:04:09.500,0:04:10.460
I was that bad.

0:04:11.060,0:04:17.680
So it went on and on, all hopes were lost, my family was crying.

0:04:18.040,0:04:20.100
My mum was asking, "God were are you?"

0:04:20.380,0:04:24.680
That you will not be alive and  
anything will come and take away one of my best.

0:04:25.180,0:04:30.900
It got to an extend that I lost hope that
 I was not going to make it anymore

0:04:31.360,0:04:33.120
I said to my self, "this is my end."

0:04:33.640,0:04:36.920
I would wake up every morning 
and go behind the door of the backyard

0:04:36.920,0:04:40.740
and look at the space there and
 wondered where will they bury me If I die.

0:04:40.980,0:04:43.120
Is it here or there?

0:04:43.120,0:04:45.774
At times my brothers will be eating, playing, laughing

0:04:45.780,0:04:47.840
and I will be looking at them and I would say to my self,

0:04:47.840,0:04:49.720
"one day I wont be seeing my brothers again."

0:04:50.420,0:04:54.420
I felt pain in me, It was the worst experience in life

0:04:54.420,0:04:57.160
for a man to be alive and know that he is dying

0:04:57.160,0:04:59.380
and there is nothing the doctors could do about it.

0:04:59.960,0:05:04.700
It was very very awful, I don't know how to say this.

0:05:04.960,0:05:06.480
But to God be the glory!

0:05:07.140,0:05:09.120
I was rejected, everybody ran away.

0:05:09.160,0:05:12.820
She was the only friend that stayed - of everybody.

0:05:13.620,0:05:15.860
She stayed, I told her....

0:05:22.700,0:05:25.440
The doctors told me that I should be very careful,

0:05:25.440,0:05:29.400
I should avoid physical contact with my family.

0:05:30.620,0:05:33.400
That I am highly contagious, 
that they may contact it.

0:05:33.680,0:05:37.360
I started avoiding my family, I would
 lock myself up in my room

0:05:37.600,0:05:40.920
instructed no one to come in, 
but she refused, she stayed

0:05:41.020,0:05:43.780
She would forced her way in, 
She would come, she clean me up.

0:05:44.220,0:05:46.300
I would tell her, are you not afraid?

0:05:46.300,0:05:48.680
You may contact this thing, and you may end up like me.

0:05:49.260,0:05:52.080
Go! don't come again, forget about me. 
you've tried your best.

0:05:52.400,0:05:55.600
She said, No! that she believe
 that nothing will happen to me.

0:05:56.180,0:05:59.180
That she believes, that even
 if anything will happen to me,

0:05:59.180,0:06:01.320
that thing should come through her first.

0:06:02.900,0:06:04.900
It went on and on until luckily

0:06:04.960,0:06:07.520
my pastor introduce me to Emmanuel TV.

0:06:08.300,0:06:13.260
I started watching Emmanuel TV, 
I saw what God is using our prophet.

0:06:13.260,0:06:16.180
'Our daddy' in the Lord, senior prophet TB Joshua

0:06:16.340,0:06:19.280
to do hearings, deliverance and all that.

0:06:20.100,0:06:21.580
I sermon courage to come

0:06:22.180,0:06:24.880
but I couldn't walk, I couldn't embark on a journey.

0:06:25.580,0:06:27.460
I couldn't sit in a vehicle for that long.

0:06:28.100,0:06:29.420
I didn't have money to board the flight

0:06:30.520,0:06:33.220
I wasn't that strong, no way to come.

0:06:33.400,0:06:36.280
I stayed, I said to myself, all hope is lost.

0:06:36.540,0:06:37.580
forget about it

0:06:37.580,0:06:40.860
It started coming to my mind that
 I was tired of this life.

0:06:41.160,0:06:44.400
The symptoms, the often symptoms,
 as if there were ants.

0:06:44.500,0:06:46.360
rolling inside my body.

0:06:46.360,0:06:51.260
And another symptoms of always shaking 
as if I was having hypertensive disease.

0:06:51.360,0:06:54.800
I was shaking that I cannot 
hold anything in my hand.

0:06:54.860,0:06:57.020
I cannot stand, I would fall down

0:06:57.020,0:06:59.940
All those symptoms were there
 and it was very awful.

0:07:00.380,0:07:02.400
I was like let me just forget everything

0:07:02.800,0:07:06.020
In fact i was tired, I started 
thinking of taking my own life.

0:07:07.340,0:07:09.460
To an extend, I said that I cant live anymore

0:07:09.860,0:07:12.200
If I have to commit suicide and go and rest,

0:07:12.340,0:07:16.580
then, so be it, so I started thinking, 
trying and practicing it.

0:07:17.220,0:07:19.140
The way I could just end up my life

0:07:19.500,0:07:20.880
and go and rest.

0:07:21.320,0:07:23.740
But the more I would do it, a voice would tell me,

0:07:23.740,0:07:27.180
"So long as there is life, there is hope. 
Dont give up!"

0:07:27.620,0:07:29.960
That voice kept on coming on and on.

0:07:30.360,0:07:32.800
But I kept on seeing myself going 
down to an extend

0:07:32.800,0:07:36.180
that I started seeing and hearing 
things that were not there.

0:07:36.640,0:07:38.680
I would be lying in my room and
 I would be seeing people

0:07:38.680,0:07:39.980
and they would be taking to me.

0:07:39.980,0:07:42.080
But physically those people are not there.

0:07:42.080,0:07:44.780
And I would be talking back at them,
 but when somebody comes in

0:07:44.780,0:07:45.980
would be like, "who are you talking to?"

0:07:46.220,0:07:47.400
I would say, "Ah, somebody."

0:07:47.400,0:07:48.520
I wouldn't see anybody again.

0:07:48.900,0:07:51.880
It happened and it went to that extend

0:07:51.880,0:07:58.220
that I knew to myself that am
 beginning to cross the boundary of this earth.

0:07:58.820,0:08:02.940
But to God be the glory, I woke up one fateful morning

0:08:03.920,0:08:09.980
I prayed and said, "God, I have tried the doctors, 
I have tried the world.

0:08:09.980,0:08:12.260
I have tried with my own strength and power

0:08:12.760,0:08:14.200
and they have all failed me.

0:08:14.700,0:08:16.920
Now I want to try you God.

0:08:17.260,0:08:19.500
Give me the strength and grace

0:08:19.780,0:08:22.760
to come to your presence and try your grace."

0:08:23.280,0:08:27.400
I said that prayer, I slept off; I woke up at 
around at around 2:00 pm in the afternoon.

0:08:28.480,0:08:32.660
I felt some energy in me, 
I felt some strength, I stood up.

0:08:33.620,0:08:38.700
I said, "Wow, I can move now,
 I think I should go to Lagos now"

0:08:39.320,0:08:41.060
My mother asked, "Going to Lagos?"

0:08:41.060,0:08:42.020
I said, "Yes!"

0:08:42.300,0:08:43.740
She said, "how? you cant, don't."

0:08:43.740,0:08:45.860
I said, No! I am leaving to Lagos now."

0:08:46.240,0:08:47.920
They were trying to stop me, I said No!

0:08:47.920,0:08:50.680
She then came and said that she is coming with me.

0:08:50.680,0:08:52.660
that she will aid me down here.

0:08:58.620,0:09:01.260
Immediately she started packing my bag

0:09:01.840,0:09:04.200
After packing my bag it was almost 3pm.

0:09:04.200,0:09:05.940
I said we are still going to Lagos

0:09:06.120,0:09:08.120
that is how we left from onitsha to asaba.

0:09:08.220,0:09:10.780
we boarded a bus, we came down to Lagos.

0:09:11.620,0:09:18.340
And to God be the glory, I was privilege 
 to be among the people in the prayer line.

0:09:18.940,0:09:21.360
And our senior prophet in the Lord

0:09:22.040,0:09:25.580
The man God has bestowed all of Him upon.

0:09:26.160,0:09:28.580
Laid just one hand.

0:09:32.240,0:09:40.740
[Applause]

0:09:41.120,0:09:45.740
This is me that was medically rejected and contempt.

0:09:46.460,0:09:49.300
I was told that I was going to die, it was painful.

0:09:49.860,0:09:51.940
but it was just a touch from God.

0:09:52.840,0:09:55.260
He raised his hand and he stretched it,

0:09:55.260,0:09:57.760
and I saw the hand of God moving with his hand.

0:09:58.480,0:10:03.180
Immediately he touched me, I felt as if the sick cloud

0:10:03.180,0:10:05.660
has left me, I saw myself on the ground.

0:10:07.100,0:10:10.040
I stood up, I felt so light;

0:10:10.500,0:10:14.460
I felt like a baby, I felt like I am new.

0:10:14.900,0:10:17.840
I felt different, I was confused

0:10:18.540,0:10:20.420
I was just thinking what happened.

0:10:21.560,0:10:25.420
He went around, he came again;
 he stood and he looked at me.

0:10:26.700,0:10:29.900
I wanted to say something,
 he touched my stomach again.

0:10:30.200,0:10:35.240
Immediately it was like as if something 
like a giant moved and left me.

0:10:35.760,0:10:37.820
And i felt that again, and i stood up.

0:10:37.820,0:10:40.020
and he said, "You are healed in Jesus name."

0:10:40.320,0:10:42.320
He said, "Go Jesus has healed you."

0:10:50.560,0:10:53.680
In me as human, I was still having that doubt.

0:10:54.260,0:10:58.820
I thought, "Doctors condemned me, 
they said they could not help me,

0:10:58.820,0:11:02.500
how can just a touch take care of everything?"

0:11:03.340,0:11:07.820
I went back to the hotel where 
we lodged, I slept off.

0:11:08.120,0:11:10.400
I woke up late in the evening around after 6:00pm,

0:11:10.800,0:11:14.400
I then remembered that there was 
retro viral drugs they gave me.

0:11:14.700,0:11:19.260
That helped control those symptoms 
like those shaking and all that.

0:11:19.900,0:11:21.740
That if you If I don't take it, you will find me shaking

0:11:21.740,0:11:23.420
and dancing and you will run away.

0:11:23.600,0:11:24.560
You would think that I want to die.

0:11:25.080,0:11:26.680
I remembered that I have not taken my pills.

0:11:26.680,0:11:28.500
I told her, "I haven't taken my pills."

0:11:29.260,0:11:31.980
She told me, "Take those pills now
 before those symptom starts,"

0:11:31.980,0:11:34.720
She was always afraid whenever 
those symptoms come up.

0:11:34.720,0:11:37.860
that I should please take them, she rushed  
and brought those pills.

0:11:37.860,0:11:38.940
and a glass of water.

0:11:39.060,0:11:41.785
And I said to her, "I wont take those pills again.

0:11:41.785,0:11:46.100
so long as this symptoms did not 
come up from church to back home here.

0:11:46.100,0:11:49.040
That means I am healed, I wont take those pills again."

0:11:57.740,0:12:05.360
And while I left the prayer 
line I was blessed with this morning water.

0:12:07.500,0:12:14.340
I went home also and ministered it with my family,

0:12:14.340,0:12:18.440
because I knew I become strong.

0:12:19.100,0:12:24.060
I had this strength in me, that
 I could now stand and call my family together

0:12:24.900,0:12:27.320
Make prayer with them and minister the anointing water

0:12:27.320,0:12:28.920
upon each and everyone of them.

0:12:29.000,0:12:30.660
And then minister upon my self.

0:12:30.900,0:12:33.660
Immediately i ministered into my mouth it went down

0:12:33.660,0:12:36.820
as if it was a cold block I had swallowed

0:12:37.360,0:12:41.040
It went down and all my body
 inside my system become cold

0:12:41.420,0:12:44.140
It was like something was reviving in me.

0:12:44.540,0:12:46.860
Like there is something going on inside.

0:12:48.260,0:12:51.460
After which, I smiled and said, "God is at work."

0:12:52.400,0:12:55.900
Then a week later, I went back to those doctors.

0:12:56.740,0:12:59.640
I said, "Doctor, I want to do this test again,"

0:12:59.820,0:13:00.800
He said, "what test?"

0:13:00.900,0:13:02.580
I said," the hepatitis B test"

0:13:03.520,0:13:06.440
He said, "You should be talking about your
 treatment, you are talking about test,

0:13:06.440,0:13:07.220
take you pills and go."

0:13:07.220,0:13:09.320
I said, "I want to do this test again."

0:13:09.740,0:13:14.840
They did the test and it showed 
non reactive which is negative.

0:13:15.820,0:13:17.620
{Shall we put our hands together, 
that

0:13:17.620,0:13:20.480
clap is not loud enough for Jesus.

0:13:20.960,0:13:30.580
Put your hands together, Louder, louder louder

0:13:30.760,0:13:36.640
for the miracle working God, hallelujah!

0:13:36.640,0:13:39.240
We know only Jesus could have just done this

0:13:39.240,0:13:40.660
Did you just hear what our brother said?

0:13:40.660,0:13:42.840
He said he was a living dead,

0:13:43.980,0:13:46.420
he was just living but he was already gone.

0:13:46.640,0:13:50.300
Because doctors had already 
condemned him dead,

0:13:50.300,0:13:53.200
as there was nothing they could 
have done about that sickness

0:13:53.200,0:13:57.440
because today in the world we 
know that it is non curable.

0:13:57.860,0:14:00.180
But for him to come and just a touch,

0:14:00.940,0:14:03.940
just a touch of Gods finger,

0:14:03.940,0:14:05.940
through his anointed servant eradicated all

0:14:05.940,0:14:09.280
those virus of Hepatitis B.

0:14:09.640,0:14:14.060
Just a week later he went back to the hospital to do another test

0:14:14.500,0:14:17.260
And it proved negative.

0:14:17.500,0:14:21.160
Who can do that? Its non other but, JESUS!

0:14:21.200,0:14:25.880
If you know that, put your hands together for Jesus!

0:14:30.360,0:14:31.320
Hallelujah!}

0:14:31.460,0:14:37.280
Then the doctor saw the result and 
he said, "No there is a mistake somewhere."

0:14:37.280,0:14:38.520
"May be there is a mistake."

0:14:38.520,0:14:39.580
I said, "what mistake?"

0:14:39.580,0:14:40.740
He said that there is a mistake.

0:14:40.740,0:14:41.660
I said there is no mistake

0:14:41.720,0:14:42.300
He said, "no!"

0:14:43.180,0:14:46.260
He called on the lab technician attendant
 and asked, "What is the problem?

0:14:46.260,0:14:47.740
what sort of mistake is this?

0:14:48.000,0:14:49.660
go and rerun this test again."

0:14:50.080,0:14:51.460
They called me back to the lab room

0:14:51.700,0:14:54.820
they took the samples and they re run the test.

0:14:54.820,0:14:57.700
I waited in the hospital for about 30 minutes.

0:14:57.700,0:15:01.020
The results came out again, It showed, 
non reactive which means negative.

0:15:01.920,0:15:03.880
the doctor asked, "Is this magic?"

0:15:04.220,0:15:05.200
I said, "magic?"

0:15:05.260,0:15:05.900
He said, "yes"

0:15:06.380,0:15:10.680
I said, "you doctors, you treat; 
who heals and who cures?"

0:15:10.680,0:15:11.720
He said God.

0:15:11.720,0:15:12.660
I said I visited God.

0:15:21.460,0:15:26.340
He then looked at me and said, "my friend,
 don't be deceived by all this magic."

0:15:26.780,0:15:30.140
they are just magics, that I 
should just stick to my drugs.

0:15:30.860,0:15:34.200
So that I may have more days to live,
 if not you will just go and die

0:15:34.200,0:15:35.540
all this people are just magicians.

0:15:35.940,0:15:38.980
I just looked at him and told him, "God bless you!"

0:15:38.980,0:15:39.700
and I left his office.

0:15:40.520,0:15:43.940
I went to another doctor that I met that ran from me

0:15:43.940,0:15:46.020
and said, "I am here for this same test,

0:15:46.020,0:15:46.820
I want to confirm it."

0:15:47.640,0:15:50.180
They did the test again, It showed negative

0:15:50.360,0:15:52.980
The doctor looked at me and said, "what happened?"

0:15:53.460,0:15:58.460
I said, "Doctor, I went to the Synagogue Church of All Nations and I met with God."

0:16:05.720,0:16:10.120
Immediately the doctor called 
the nurses and showed them the results.

0:16:10.880,0:16:13.220
The nurses started jumping and dancing

0:16:13.220,0:16:15.860
they left all the patients they were attending to

0:16:15.860,0:16:17.860
and they were all dancing in the hospital.

0:16:17.860,0:16:21.020
If you saw the way they were dancing, 
shouting and singing praises

0:16:21.020,0:16:24.280
I was just looking at them, they were
 all hugging me one after the other.

0:16:25.040,0:16:26.720
Thanking God for my life.

0:16:26.920,0:16:28.760
And everybody was so happy.

0:16:28.900,0:16:31.760
I went back home, my mum looked at me.

0:16:32.300,0:16:35.980
In the compound where i live, 
everybody was dancing and singing

0:16:35.980,0:16:37.420
and we were all happy.

0:16:37.660,0:16:42.700
And to God be the glory, I stayed and stayed

0:16:42.700,0:16:44.940
I had to go back for the test to confirm

0:16:45.340,0:16:46.400
It showed negative

0:16:46.460,0:16:47.740
I smiled within me.

0:16:48.260,0:16:50.583
A year after, i was still living and i said,

0:16:50.583,0:16:53.080
"Oh doctors said I was going to die soon,

0:16:53.120,0:16:54.320
and here I am alive."

0:16:54.340,0:16:59.940
This is two years now, I am alive 
healthy, stronger as you can see.

0:16:59.940,0:17:02.080
{Put your hands together once again for Jesus.

0:17:05.600,0:17:08.480
If Jesus say yes, no one can say no,

0:17:08.840,0:17:11.306
Jesus Christ is the master healer and we have seen

0:17:11.306,0:17:13.180
the prove in the life of our brother.

0:17:13.280,0:17:14.960
Who is a living testimony.}

0:17:15.400,0:17:26.120
This is the hepatitis B genotypes, 
as you can see here they all show positives

0:17:26.140,0:17:28.460
It shows that the were all detected

0:17:30.400,0:17:31.620
As you can see here.

0:17:31.980,0:17:37.820
Then this is the hepatitis B DNA, as you can see here.

0:17:38.580,0:17:40.740
this is the viral load and the DNA

0:17:41.700,0:17:42.580
as you can see

0:17:44.340,0:17:47.220
It shows that it is there on the higher side.

0:17:47.220,0:17:51.320
This is also another confirmation 
from federal medical center Asaba

0:17:51.620,0:17:57.540
It shows positive, that was before I came to the Synagogue Church of All Nations.

0:17:58.320,0:18:04.120
This was after my encounter with 
God through senior prophet TB Joshua

0:18:05.180,0:18:11.860
I went back and I did another test,
 and here it says non reactive,

0:18:12.480,0:18:14.320
which is negative.

0:18:14.940,0:18:18.700
Weeks later, I still went back for another confirmation,

0:18:20.400,0:18:22.600
and it still shows the same report,

0:18:23.360,0:18:26.460
non reactive - which is negative.

0:18:27.120,0:18:34.480
I wasn't satisfied, to clear my doubt; 
I had to go and do retro viral screening

0:18:35.180,0:18:38.640
which means all viral infection tests.

0:18:40.600,0:18:45.480
And they all showed negative including
 HIV, everything showed negative.

0:18:55.020,0:18:57.680
The person next beside me is my very good friend.

0:18:58.140,0:19:01.140
I am very very happy to stand here
 to testify

0:19:01.140,0:19:03.500
the goodness of God in my friends life.

0:19:04.680,0:19:08.640
Back in 2014, he was very very bad

0:19:09.280,0:19:14.260
The sickness was very bad with him, 
he could not talk, walk or eat.

0:19:14.720,0:19:19.040
I used to call him then letter 'I' 
because he was slim as letter 'I'

0:19:19.880,0:19:22.260
The doctors said that he wont make it,

0:19:22.800,0:19:26.760
that even if he wastes all his money
 that he was not going to make it.

0:19:26.760,0:19:30.260
But today he is alive for the glory of God.

0:19:35.960,0:19:37.480
{Yes we have heard from the friend who

0:19:37.700,0:19:41.240
is a witness to the condition that the brother was in

0:19:41.240,0:19:43.820
before he came to the SCOAN.

0:19:44.080,0:19:47.580
And now that God almighty has 
healed him she is a witness

0:19:47.580,0:19:50.500
and she is telling us of God goodness in his life.

0:19:50.860,0:19:56.460
So tell us now, or demonstrate to 
us the things you can do now.

0:19:56.860,0:19:58.860
which you could not do before.}

0:20:00.280,0:20:05.760
Before, I know when they say that
 some people are walking corpse

0:20:05.760,0:20:08.480
mind how you act, dont slap somebody, dont fight

0:20:08.480,0:20:10.540
you might just slap him and he die; 
he is a walking corpse.

0:20:10.540,0:20:14.460
With my experience then, i knew what a
 walking corpse really was.

0:20:15.040,0:20:17.400
because I couldn't do anything on my own

0:20:17.400,0:20:21.840
But now, If you can permit me, i can 
climb up this stare case and jump from there.

0:20:21.960,0:20:23.260
I can.....

0:20:26.900,0:20:29.140
I am strong now, I can do anything.

0:20:29.640,0:20:31.680
I go to my sport and exercise

0:20:32.300,0:20:34.720
I run 10 km every morning

0:20:35.180,0:20:38.300
I do my training, all those things i couldn't do; I do.

0:20:38.600,0:20:40.600
Like before, I couldn't eat

0:20:41.060,0:20:44.420
for like five months i was on vegetables and fruits.

0:20:45.920,0:20:50.480
But now I eat anything I see comfortably,

0:20:50.560,0:20:52.280
no problem anymore.

0:20:52.280,0:20:55.100
As you see me now, I can say
 I am even stronger than anybody here.

0:21:00.200,0:21:03.160
My advice for the viewers all over the world,

0:21:03.900,0:21:05.500
especially the youths.

0:21:07.340,0:21:13.200
Is that 'God is the author and finisher of our faith.'

0:21:14.520,0:21:16.060
Our prophet always says, '

0:21:16.060,0:21:21.000
When we sin, we should not run away
 from God rather we should run to God.'

0:21:22.600,0:21:27.560
And also the Bible made it well known that
sickness is from the pit of hell.

0:21:28.300,0:21:32.560
and the only thing that attracts sickness, I know of now.

0:21:32.620,0:21:33.900
Is sinfull nature.

0:21:34.800,0:21:40.020
My advice to viewers all over the world is to run to God.

0:21:41.060,0:21:44.060
keep close to him, do his will,

0:21:44.560,0:21:50.080
obey his commandments and 
you will find yourself flying like a wind.

0:21:50.420,0:21:52.180
like an eagle

0:21:53.400,0:21:57.380
My advice to them now is, 
don't listen to what people say.

0:21:58.460,0:22:01.220
come and confirm yourself.

0:22:01.840,0:22:07.660
The Lord Jesus who is the same, 
yesterday, today and forevermore is here

0:22:07.840,0:22:11.120
even right now as i am speaking he is here.

0:22:16.940,0:22:18.800
{ Hallelujah! we thank you for that wonderful advice

0:22:18.800,0:22:20.100
As our brother has said,

0:22:20.280,0:22:23.020
that God almighty never
 disconnect Himself from those who

0:22:23.020,0:22:24.960
make mistakes with their lives.

0:22:25.560,0:22:27.160
He loves them and welcomes them,

0:22:27.160,0:22:30.740
and you know that forgiveness 
of sins strikes the roots of all things.

0:22:30.880,0:22:32.580
And as you are equally being advised

0:22:32.940,0:22:38.120
to find out the truth, and that truth shall set us free.

0:22:38.940,0:22:40.940
We give God all mighty all the
 Glory for what He has done in your life,

0:22:40.940,0:22:42.220
for restoring back your health.

0:22:42.220,0:22:45.240
And making you a living testimony
 to the goodness of God,

0:22:45.240,0:22:46.140
and the lives of the people.

0:22:46.140,0:22:47.600
And now that the Lord almighty has set you free,

0:22:47.600,0:22:50.160
Remember that is for non other but 
for the salvation of your soul.

0:22:50.800,0:22:53.040
So make sure you continue to follow him along the way,

0:22:53.040,0:22:54.700
and make his word the standard for your life.

0:22:54.820,0:22:59.440
And I know His Word will continue to 
set you on the good road to the good life.}

0:22:59.440,0:23:00.080
Amen!

0:23:00.080,0:23:04.960
{So once again let us put our hands together wonderfully for our lord and Savior Jesus Christ!}
