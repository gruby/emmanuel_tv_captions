0:00:00.060,0:00:01.680
Prophecy Time

0:00:01.680,0:00:09.360
You married through media - images.

0:00:09.360,0:00:15.920
That is your first attempt - somebody you have not seen physically.

0:00:15.920,0:00:17.720
Yes, it's true, Man of God.

0:00:17.720,0:00:19.180
Just like on the internet.

0:00:19.180,0:00:20.900
It is true, Man of God, very true.

0:00:20.900,0:00:21.840
Do you want me to talk to you?

0:00:21.840,0:00:23.660
Yes.

0:00:23.660,0:00:27.120
Someone you were not seeing - through internet, through chat.

0:00:27.120,0:00:30.120
You chatted and you decided to marry the person.

0:00:30.120,0:00:33.680
It' is true, Man of God, it is true.

0:00:33.680,0:00:35.860
This is the beginning of where your life was destroyed.

0:00:35.860,0:00:38.200
Please deliver me, Man of God.

0:00:38.200,0:00:41.800
You did not see - you just chatted and didn't even know the face

0:00:41.800,0:00:46.400
whether they may send you a wrong face and you decided to marry the person.

0:00:46.400,0:00:48.860
That is how the marriage was established.

0:00:48.860,0:00:52.240
It is true, Man of God; please deliver me, Man of God.

0:00:52.240,0:00:54.600
Please deliver me.

0:00:54.600,0:01:02.180
Deliverance in Jesus' Name

0:01:03.040,0:01:06.580
TESTIMONY CONTINUES

0:01:06.880,0:01:10.060
People of God - Emmanuel! 
(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)

0:01:10.060,0:01:12.180
My name is Samahar Daniel.

0:01:12.180,0:01:14.080
I came from France.

0:01:14.080,0:01:16.640
I am originally Ethiopian.

0:01:16.640,0:01:21.000
What the man of God said last week is very true.

0:01:21.000,0:01:25.740
I was actually married through the internet when I was fifteen years old.

0:01:25.740,0:01:30.720
That is something that I have never ever shared in my life.

0:01:30.720,0:01:35.980
When I came here on Sunday, I was just sitting over there.

0:01:35.980,0:01:41.280
The man of God came to me as you saw and prophesied that straight to me.

0:01:41.280,0:01:43.840
I was really shocked and surprised

0:01:43.840,0:01:46.760
and very thankful to God that He has done this for me

0:01:46.760,0:01:50.100
because I was very hopeless.

0:01:50.100,0:01:55.520
When I got married to that internet relationship - 
as I told you I was fifteen years old...

0:01:55.520,0:01:58.920
After that, in the relationship that I had on the internet...

0:01:58.920,0:02:05.680
When I even used to date people or go out with some guys, I was never satisfied.

0:02:05.680,0:02:10.380
I mean the only thing that could satisfy me was having a relationship with an unknown person

0:02:10.380,0:02:13.260
that I had never seen in my entire life.

0:02:13.260,0:02:20.360
This problem led me to smoking, I used to go out and drink

0:02:20.360,0:02:23.900
when I was only fifteen and a half years old.

0:02:23.900,0:02:30.240
Every day someone around me would say, "When are you going to stop smoking?

0:02:30.240,0:02:32.260
When are you going to stop drinking?"

0:02:32.260,0:02:39.780
I used to take ecstasy, smoking cigarettes and 'weed' - 'weed' was every single day.

0:02:39.780,0:02:44.160
Each and every year, it got worse, worse and worse.

0:02:44.160,0:02:48.860
My mum sent me here for this issue last week.

0:02:48.860,0:02:58.400
When I came here I was very hopeless because whenever I used to go to church,

0:02:58.400,0:03:02.540
I used to tell the junior pastors to deliver me of my problems.

0:03:02.540,0:03:05.720
The next day I got to the church,

0:03:05.720,0:03:11.280
the pastor would come to me and prophesy everything I had told the junior pastors.

0:03:11.280,0:03:16.180
I was like, "No. God doesn't exist. It's not true, it cannot be true.

0:03:16.180,0:03:20.700
If I told someone what I was going through and he went to tell it to another person,

0:03:20.700,0:03:24.560
where was the proof that God is alive or works miracles.

0:03:24.560,0:03:28.640
When I came to the The SCOAN last week and sat over there,

0:03:28.640,0:03:31.420
I said to myself, "Ok, now we are going to see".

0:03:31.420,0:03:34.520
But I really had hope that my life would change.

0:03:34.520,0:03:41.340
I was not a believer but I would still be like, "Please, Jesus, if you are alive, please help me.

0:03:41.340,0:03:44.120
I am struggling and I am tired of it".

0:03:44.120,0:03:47.300
Because my life depended on the things I took.

0:03:47.300,0:03:50.700
I fought with my parents; with my mum.

0:03:50.700,0:03:54.460
I got very aggressive, uncontrollable.

0:03:54.460,0:03:56.760
My breakfast was cigarettes and coffee.

0:03:56.760,0:03:59.640
That was the only thing that could calm my soul.

0:03:59.640,0:04:02.080
If I didn't get that, if I didn't smoke,

0:04:02.080,0:04:07.840
I would be very mad, so aggressive and very impolite.

0:04:07.840,0:04:11.280
Even on Sunday, when I was sitting over there,

0:04:11.280,0:04:14.380
every single minute I wanted to go out and smoke.

0:04:14.380,0:04:18.320
I was actually smoking. I smoked four cigarettes before coming to church.

0:04:18.320,0:04:23.500
Even when I was here, I was fighting with the ushers to let me go out and smoke.

0:04:23.500,0:04:26.840
That I didn't feel good, please.

0:04:26.840,0:04:30.520
When the Man of God came and prophecied to me,

0:04:30.520,0:04:35.640
I said to myself, "Thank God! There is actually a true man of God in this world.

0:04:35.640,0:04:38.220
Not everyone is fooling people".

0:04:38.220,0:04:42.220
I was very happy; it was like a dream come through.

0:04:42.220,0:04:47.220
Immediately after that, people of God - I don't smoke anymore.

0:04:47.220,0:04:50.300
Miss Samahar Daniel - Prophecy Testimony

0:04:50.300,0:04:52.060
That is not enough for Jesus Christ.

0:04:52.060,0:04:55.560
Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:04:55.560,0:04:58.240
Miss Samahar Daniel - Prophecy Testimony

0:04:58.240,0:05:02.660
My parents used to take me to church but I never believed.

0:05:02.660,0:05:06.120
But my last experience really killed me.

0:05:06.120,0:05:10.280
I told myself that if God really existed, He would do something.

0:05:10.280,0:05:16.380
I would tell Him, "Why don't you do something? Please do something if you are here".

0:05:16.380,0:05:22.540
I came to The SCOAN with a lot of struggles.

0:05:22.540,0:05:28.080
My mum who pushed me to come here - there was even a time she was against it.

0:05:28.080,0:05:34.300
This was really meant to be. God really wanted to deliver me using the man of God.

0:05:34.300,0:05:40.820
Okay, now can you tell us what happened here that made you believe that God exists?

0:05:40.820,0:05:48.920
The prophesy was true because this was something I had never ever shared in my entire life.

0:05:48.920,0:05:53.660
This was the source of my problems.

0:05:53.660,0:05:58.580
This was the reason why I became who I was in the past.

0:05:58.580,0:06:00.660
And you didn't discuss this with anyone before coming here?

0:06:00.660,0:06:03.080
No! I had never told anyone.

0:06:03.080,0:06:05.840
Even for me - this was something that I had forgotten.

0:06:05.840,0:06:11.740
When the man of God said it, immediately I was like, "Ah! Yes! It was true!"

0:06:11.740,0:06:14.920
Whilst sitting on the seat, I was thinking about it.

0:06:14.920,0:06:17.220
In the night, I was thinking about it.

0:06:17.220,0:06:20.200
I had this flashback.

0:06:20.200,0:06:22.220
I remembered everything.

0:06:22.220,0:06:24.060
I started recollecting things.

0:06:24.060,0:06:26.140
God was showing me, "You see when I did this?"

0:06:26.140,0:06:29.480
Everything was so clear after that and so visible in my life.

0:06:29.480,0:06:31.520
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!

0:06:31.520,0:06:34.240
Miss Samahar Daniel - Prophecy Testimony

0:06:34.240,0:06:42.200
Now, after having received a prophecy, that made you to believe that Jesus Christ exists -

0:06:42.200,0:06:44.320
the issue that you had never discussed with anyone -

0:06:44.320,0:06:48.300
what is your belief now about the existence of Jesus?

0:06:48.300,0:06:50.960
I had never found happiness in my entire life.

0:06:50.960,0:06:54.460
Wherever I went, whatever I did, I wasn't happy.

0:06:54.460,0:06:57.700
I used to go out, smoke, do every bad stuff.

0:06:57.700,0:07:00.080
But I had never been happy in my entire life.

0:07:00.080,0:07:05.700
And yes, I do believe now that God is really here and that He watches over us and protects us.

0:07:05.700,0:07:10.120
Because I have been through a lot of things, no matter how young I was.

0:07:10.120,0:07:14.500
I used to go out, drink and find myself with an unknown man.

0:07:14.500,0:07:17.960
And then I was like, "Samahar, why did you do that? What happened?"

0:07:17.960,0:07:20.720
And this was even unexplainable to myself.

0:07:20.720,0:07:23.000
I couldn't even explain it to myself.

0:07:23.000,0:07:27.960
So yes, God has protected me and my spiritual life since then has changed

0:07:27.960,0:07:31.280
because I would never stay five minutes in a church.

0:07:31.280,0:07:34.740
No matter where my mum took me, pastors coming to our home praying for me,

0:07:34.740,0:07:38.140
I would just go out to smoke my cigarettes and argue with everyone.

0:07:38.140,0:07:41.860
For the first time in my life, I attended a whole long service -

0:07:41.860,0:07:43.740
from the morning till the night!

0:07:43.740,0:07:47.900
And I pray and read the Bible.

0:07:47.900,0:07:48.980
I thank God!

0:07:48.980,0:07:52.060
Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!

0:07:52.060,0:07:55.080
Miss Samahar Daniel - Prophecy Testimony

0:07:55.080,0:07:59.600
Now once again, because of how wonderful your testimony is,

0:07:59.600,0:08:04.240
and your testimony will go a long way to affect the youths all over the world positively...

0:08:04.240,0:08:07.760
Could you once again tell us, when you were addicted to this smoking and drinking,

0:08:07.760,0:08:10.940
how severe was it? How did it affect your entire life?

0:08:10.940,0:08:13.300
Could you tell us once again?

0:08:13.300,0:08:21.380
I think maybe people who have had an addiction before would understand what I'm exactly saying.

0:08:21.380,0:08:26.800
Because even not to eat breakfast is really hard.

0:08:26.800,0:08:30.060
When I got up in the morning, the only thing that I wanted to do

0:08:30.060,0:08:33.320
was just to light a cigarette and have a coffee.

0:08:33.320,0:08:36.820
Once I even burnt my hair just trying to light a cigarette.

0:08:36.820,0:08:39.880
That was the only thing I wanted upon getting up.

0:08:39.880,0:08:46.260
When my parents were around, I couldn't smoke and I had to pretend that I was not a smoker.

0:08:46.260,0:08:50.140
Then, I would start a fight - I would become aggressive and find a reason to go out and smoke.

0:08:50.140,0:08:53.720
I could have never ever stopped.

0:08:53.720,0:08:55.960
I actually thought I would end up smoking.

0:08:55.960,0:08:57.860
Really, I would end up smoking.

0:08:57.860,0:09:05.220
Everyone in my family found out that I used to smoke 'weed' and cigarettes.

0:09:05.220,0:09:10.500
If it hadn't been for God, I would have never ever got out of the situation; that's for sure.

0:09:10.500,0:09:13.040
Miss Samahar Daniel - Prophecy Testimony

0:09:13.040,0:09:14.320
To God be the glory!

0:09:14.320,0:09:19.780
Can you just tell us how this relationship you had on the internet affected your life,

0:09:19.780,0:09:22.200
in confirmation of the prophecy given by the man of God,

0:09:22.200,0:09:24.080
of which you said that you had never discussed it with anyone

0:09:24.080,0:09:28.820
and you were so shocked hearing that from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for the first time last Sunday.

0:09:28.820,0:09:31.960
Can you tell us how this relationship affected your life as a young lady.

0:09:31.960,0:09:36.200
It affected me in the sense that I was never happy.

0:09:36.200,0:09:40.220
I was never happy with any relationship I had.

0:09:40.220,0:09:45.440
I preferred to have a person I had never met - through images only.

0:09:45.440,0:09:49.480
That gave me satisfaction.

0:09:49.480,0:09:51.580
The untouchable made me happy,

0:09:51.580,0:09:55.860
whilst I could have had someone I knew and went through life together.

0:09:55.860,0:10:00.140
But no - the unknown would make me happier.

0:10:00.140,0:10:07.060
It affected me in the sense that I was always unfaithful to the person I was with.

0:10:07.060,0:10:09.080
We thank God Almighty for your life.

0:10:09.080,0:10:14.020
After the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, gave you that message of prophecy

0:10:14.020,0:10:17.720
and you were delivered, what are the changes that have taken place in your life,

0:10:17.720,0:10:19.900
compared to your past life?

0:10:19.900,0:10:23.880
When I came here, I came on my own.

0:10:23.880,0:10:25.840
So I was staying in a hotel.

0:10:25.840,0:10:31.400
In my hotel room, I had two packets of cigarettes and one lighter.

0:10:31.400,0:10:36.300
While I was coming to The SCOAN to stay here, I left everything that I had.

0:10:36.300,0:10:39.620
And I was even surprised that I had somehow left everything in the truck.

0:10:39.620,0:10:41.440
It is incredible.

0:10:41.440,0:10:45.600
I was the type of person who would steal lighters from people. Believe me.

0:10:45.600,0:10:56.200
If a thrown-away packet of cigarettes was on the floor, I would check if there were cigarettes in it.

0:10:56.200,0:11:00.480
I would have never thought that I would leave forty cigarettes behind.

0:11:00.480,0:11:02.200
And I am still not smoking.

0:11:02.200,0:11:03.920
I will never smoke again. I thank God.

0:11:03.920,0:11:08.080
You mean the urge to smoke and drink is completely gone after the deliverance?

0:11:08.080,0:11:09.960
Gone - 100%.

0:11:09.960,0:11:12.200
Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ for that!

0:11:12.200,0:11:15.720
Miss Samahar Daniel - Prophecy Testimony

0:11:15.720,0:11:18.780
Finally, as a young lady who has experienced a lot in the world,

0:11:18.780,0:11:22.160
before Jesus Christ rescued you from the shackles of satan,

0:11:22.160,0:11:25.580
what word of advice do you have for people around the world,

0:11:25.580,0:11:28.560
especially for the youth who are already into such a trap?

0:11:28.560,0:11:30.380
What do you advise them to do?

0:11:30.380,0:11:33.420
My advice would be to come to Jesus Christ

0:11:33.420,0:11:38.260
because you can never come out of this situation on your own.

0:11:38.260,0:11:44.860
I tried everything to stop; I was even in rehab back in France.

0:11:44.860,0:11:48.680
This is something that human beings cannot heal.

0:11:48.680,0:11:52.620
It is only through God. So please come to Jesus.

0:11:52.620,0:11:54.920
He has the solution for everything.

0:11:54.920,0:12:01.540
Indeed our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.

0:12:01.540,0:12:04.000
Having experienced that the Lord is good,

0:12:04.000,0:12:08.100
we beseech you to continue your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ

0:12:08.100,0:12:11.580
and we pray that as you continue your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ,

0:12:11.580,0:12:13.420
always have it at the back of your mind that

0:12:13.420,0:12:16.500
better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.

0:12:16.500,0:12:18.160
Let us clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
