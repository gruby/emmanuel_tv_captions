0:00:00.000,0:00:02.620
{When you leave here where are you going madam?}

0:00:03.260,0:00:04.200
Yola

0:00:04.200,0:00:05.680
{Yola? to who?}

0:00:07.760,0:00:09.240
I stay with my mum.

0:00:09.265,0:00:12.265
{Because I am seing you living on your own

0:00:13.315,0:00:14.915
What is wrong with you?

0:00:16.180,0:00:17.940
you are frustrated?}

0:00:17.940,0:00:18.900
Yes sir.

0:00:19.400,0:00:21.400
{And this frustration has led you to do many things.

0:00:22.280,0:00:24.900
which you don't want to do?

0:00:24.900,0:00:26.060
And you are tired now?}

0:00:26.060,0:00:27.220
Yes sir.

0:00:28.500,0:00:33.100
{There was a man you were with for sometime and you left?}

0:00:33.420,0:00:34.160
Yes sir.

0:00:34.380,0:00:35.000
{What happened?

0:00:35.080,0:00:37.740
there was something you discovered?

0:00:39.080,0:00:39.960
She is your daughter?}

0:00:39.960,0:00:40.520
Yes sir.

0:00:40.940,0:00:43.760
{I said your daughter is troubled,}

0:00:43.765,0:00:44.765
Yes sir

0:00:44.920,0:00:48.080
I have problems, we come all the way from Yola.

0:00:48.740,0:00:50.400
We came from yola.

0:00:50.740,0:00:52.220
{You don't know what is happening?}

0:00:52.320,0:00:53.840
Yes sir,  don't know even in my own life

0:00:54.800,0:00:55.740
{Lets go!}

0:01:02.720,0:01:06.040
My name is Doris, from Yola.

0:01:06.040,0:01:10.520
Last week Sunday the man of God walked up to me,

0:01:10.520,0:01:12.200
and prophesied.

0:01:12.500,0:01:15.480
He asked me where I was going from here.

0:01:15.900,0:01:18.500
and that he saw me living alone

0:01:18.500,0:01:21.755
and frustrated and tired

0:01:21.755,0:01:25.155
and that this has caused me to do things that I did not want to do.

0:01:25.620,0:01:29.520
And that I broke up with a man because I discovered something.

0:01:30.000,0:01:32.820
And he said that I am a troubled daughter.

0:01:33.280,0:01:35.660
which is very true and correct.

0:01:36.120,0:01:38.560
When he asked me where i was going from here

0:01:38.560,0:01:43.080
I said Yola but Yola things are so difficult for us.

0:01:43.580,0:01:45.240
Our rent has expired,

0:01:46.160,0:01:49.020
we have no money to pay for the house rent

0:01:49.560,0:01:53.800
People think that I am okay and that I have money

0:01:53.800,0:01:55.420
but i have nothing.

0:01:55.875,0:01:58.875
This has caused frustrations

0:01:58.880,0:02:02.980
I have even tried to stub myself many times, to kill my self

0:02:02.980,0:02:04.820
but my mum will come and hold me.

0:02:05.085,0:02:07.755
I was just tired of the life I was living.

0:02:12.155,0:02:13.155
I have no work,

0:02:13.505,0:02:14.505
nothing.

0:02:15.665,0:02:18.605
Look at me, i ought to be married now

0:02:19.805,0:02:21.735
but no man is coming up.

0:02:23.505,0:02:26.395
(So what the man of God said concerning you

0:02:26.485,0:02:28.115
is correct when he asked, "Where are  you going?"

0:02:28.460,0:02:30.760
You actually have no where to go now.)

0:02:30.760,0:02:31.260
Yes!

0:02:31.960,0:02:34.140
(Okay, can we hear a word or two from your mother?

0:02:35.180,0:02:37.180
I believe she also has something to say.

0:02:41.720,0:02:42.720
Emmanuel!

0:02:43.620,0:02:45.920
We are from Yola

0:02:45.920,0:02:49.755
When we came here, the man of God prophesied

0:02:49.760,0:02:53.080
to my daughter, that she is a troubled daughter.

0:02:53.780,0:02:57.760
Then, i got up and said even me.

0:02:59.580,0:03:02.360
Later on the man of God said that we should go and see him.

0:03:02.360,0:03:06.480
Our live is miserable, even when he asked, where we were going to.

0:03:06.480,0:03:08.600
We have no where to go, we have no destination.

0:03:08.605,0:03:12.095
We have no where to go because right now we have nothing.

0:03:12.685,0:03:15.365
She wants to kill herself

0:03:15.365,0:03:16.365
she wants to stub herself.

0:03:17.020,0:03:19.460
Anytime she takes knife to kill herself i would hold her.

0:03:19.900,0:03:22.735
I said that I would talk to her to believe in God

0:03:22.735,0:03:24.885
because God is the God that makes things possible-

0:03:24.885,0:03:26.835
Impossibility made possible.

0:03:27.200,0:03:30.240
Before we came here I was thinking how we would get into this place

0:03:31.000,0:03:32.360
But I had no way

0:03:32.860,0:03:34.700
Somebody gave me somethings to sell.

0:03:35.200,0:03:36.200
then i took her and told her

0:03:36.260,0:03:40.560
"Come, lets run to our father TB Joshua."

0:03:40.560,0:03:42.840
I think this is the last bus stop.

0:03:44.640,0:03:46.880
(Mama, we want to here more from you

0:03:46.880,0:03:49.440
we can see the old woman shedding tears because of the situation

0:03:49.445,0:03:51.865
that they have been in for years.

0:03:52.315,0:03:55.465
You said that the man of God prophesied that your daughter

0:03:55.525,0:03:58.375
is a troubled child, can you tell us more about those troubles

0:03:58.385,0:04:01.355
that your child was facing before the prophecy was given

0:04:01.355,0:04:03.945
last service day?)

0:04:04.315,0:04:07.175
The trouble she was having was; she had no job,

0:04:07.180,0:04:11.440
no husband, no helper to ease her problems.

0:04:11.820,0:04:15.540
no house, so she decided to say that she was going to die and kill herself.

0:04:16.300,0:04:18.620
Several times I have collected knife from her.

0:04:18.620,0:04:20.140
Even rat poison, she says she will drink

0:04:20.140,0:04:21.220
I would collect it from her.

0:04:21.620,0:04:25.880
(The trouble of your child, how has that affected you as a mother?)

0:04:26.760,0:04:30.740
It has affected me, even right now I am having heart problem.

0:04:31.320,0:04:33.000
{The mother and the lady,

0:04:34.560,0:04:38.700
you have listen to that, you cannot blame them for their misfortune.

0:04:42.540,0:04:43.640
When we work,

0:04:44.545,0:04:46.785
God still has to examine it.

0:04:48.385,0:04:51.225
That is, after you have done everything

0:04:52.525,0:04:53.525
humanly

0:04:54.535,0:04:57.435
God will still have to go through it

0:04:57.435,0:04:58.435
and mark it.

0:05:00.005,0:05:01.055
Can you see?

0:05:01.505,0:05:04.495
After you have done it perfectly, to you

0:05:04.495,0:05:05.685
you have done it.

0:05:06.775,0:05:09.885
You can now begin to say, now it is alright,

0:05:09.885,0:05:12.495
God will still go through it and mark it

0:05:12.495,0:05:14.355
one by one.

0:05:16.775,0:05:19.165
That is what we call Grace.

0:05:20.295,0:05:22.845
After you have moved and working

0:05:24.425,0:05:26.865
and you say, "Yes, i have done it perfectly."

0:05:27.645,0:05:30.725
As a christian, that language is not right.

0:05:33.045,0:05:34.045
Yes!

0:05:35.415,0:05:38.635
As Christians, we live under grace

0:05:39.875,0:05:41.605
the grace cover us.

0:05:42.805,0:05:45.805
After you have moved and worked

0:05:45.805,0:05:49.065
humanly possibly, you have done it right to you.

0:05:50.085,0:05:52.435
And you say, this is the right thing I have done.

0:05:52.935,0:05:54.085
Leave it for God.

0:05:54.835,0:05:56.575
God will still have to

0:05:57.725,0:05:58.755
mark it.

0:05:59.615,0:06:03.055
So, it is up to God to give you

0:06:03.335,0:06:04.335
Mark!

0:06:04.695,0:06:07.855
Whether 90%,50% or 40%

0:06:07.855,0:06:10.885
Its over to God.

0:06:11.960,0:06:13.900
This is GRACE.

0:06:14.720,0:06:18.320
If anyone now says this family

0:06:19.200,0:06:21.660
are to be blamed, or ask them why

0:06:21.660,0:06:25.320
You have hands, you have legs, why cant yo go and work?

0:06:26.500,0:06:29.000
You need to ask your self

0:06:30.460,0:06:34.840
by what authority are you also achieving what you have achieved.

0:06:36.760,0:06:39.100
The woman, have no where to live

0:06:39.800,0:06:43.620
when you are looking at their appearance  and attire.

0:06:44.200,0:06:45.960
very expensive attire

0:06:47.220,0:06:48.360
and good looking.

0:06:50.160,0:06:57.100
That could not actually confuse the Spirit  of God

0:06:58.380,0:07:02.380
The attire and everything were past glory.

0:07:05.060,0:07:06.600
Past what?

0:07:06.920,0:07:10.080
Past glory, those things they had in the past.

0:07:11.620,0:07:15.400
So the mother and daughter,

0:07:15.740,0:07:19.260
because we have learn t that the house rent is

0:07:19.260,0:07:21.360
is not under N200,000

0:07:21.560,0:07:24.380
they should give them N500,000 to start something.}

0:07:29.980,0:07:31.700
(As hand of love and care,

0:07:31.700,0:07:34.800
the man of God has said that a sum of N500,000

0:07:34.800,0:07:38.400
should be given to the mother and her daughter for support.

0:07:40.320,0:07:40.980
 

0:07:43.700,0:07:46.820
We can see the woman, tears of joy running down her cheek.)

0:07:46.820,0:07:49.220
