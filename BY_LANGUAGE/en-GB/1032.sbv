0:00:00.000,0:00:08.660
My name is Yinka Oduwole.

0:00:08.660,0:00:13.000
When I was growing up in Lagos Nigeria, I never imagined

0:00:13.000,0:00:18.960
that one day I would be an alumnus of the most prestigious university in the world.

0:00:18.960,0:00:23.060
Positive examples are motivators for success.

0:00:23.060,0:00:33.520
My success today I owe to the man, although not my biological father, took me, nurtured me, motivated me,

0:00:33.520,0:00:37.940
inspired me, sponsored me and taught me to believe

0:00:37.940,0:00:42.720
that I could achieve something far beyond what I could ever dream.

0:00:42.720,0:00:49.140
As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Broken focus is the real reason men fail".

0:00:49.140,0:00:55.500
For many, studying abroad can open the door to distractions and temptations.

0:00:55.500,0:01:03.060
What enabled me to maintain my focus, was to always remember the great trust deposited in me.

0:01:03.060,0:01:06.120
I never forgot where I am coming from.

0:01:06.120,0:01:11.520
As I don my graduation gown and collect my doctorate certificate,

0:01:11.520,0:01:18.880
I know that I am doing it not for myself alone, but for the thousands all over the world who are right now

0:01:18.880,0:01:24.720
being helped, equipped and trained because of T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners.

0:01:24.720,0:01:42.080
We are the leaders of tomorrow.

0:01:42.080,0:02:03.140
With no sign of pressure on her big day, Yinka gets ready for the ceremony.

0:02:03.140,0:02:11.060
She has spent the last four years of her life working, researching, and studying for her PhD

0:02:11.060,0:02:16.400
or Doctorate of Philosophy in Engineering Science at Oxford University,

0:02:16.400,0:02:24.780
thought by many to be the most prestigious university in the world.

0:02:24.780,0:02:31.820
Yinka first heads to Kellogg College, Oxford's largest graduate-only college, where she has been studying.

0:02:31.820,0:02:35.500
Hello viewers, thank you so much for following me on this journey.

0:02:35.500,0:02:37.040
Today is my graduation.

0:02:37.040,0:02:41.400
I am graduating with a PhD in Engineering Science in Oxford University.

0:02:41.400,0:02:46.060
I am here in the halls of residence in my college, Kellogg College.

0:02:46.060,0:02:50.860
I just want to say a big thanks to Prophet T.B Joshua, my mentor

0:02:50.860,0:02:54.220
and Emmanuel TV Partners who have made this journey a success.

0:02:54.220,0:02:56.960
I hope you continue to follow me, and thank you so much.

0:02:56.960,0:03:04.380
Hello, I'm Elsa Bell and I have the great honour today of being the Dean of Degrees.

0:03:04.380,0:03:11.340
This means I help the students on their journey as they graduate.

0:03:11.340,0:03:18.740
It's such fun, such a great honour because this is one of the most important days of their life.

0:03:18.740,0:03:23.380
We graduate in a very serious and solemn way

0:03:23.380,0:03:27.660
but in our hearts, we're cheering for the students like Yinka

0:03:27.660,0:03:32.720
who have worked and worked and worked to gain her DPhil.

0:03:32.720,0:03:38.800
One of the other glories of today is that families, friends and organisations

0:03:38.800,0:03:43.700
all stand by and share in this day of great joy.

0:03:43.700,0:03:48.600
So, congratulations to our students, thank you to all their supporters

0:03:48.600,0:03:50.880
and we know we are going to have a marvellous time!

0:04:05.060,0:04:09.080
to hear the briefing of what they should expect in today's' ceremony.

The Dean of Degrees of Kellogg College, Emeritus Fellow Elsa Bell congratulates the graduates

0:04:28.280,0:04:31.440
on their momentous achievement and appreciates those

0:04:31.440,0:04:36.920
who made it possible for the students to realize their dream of an Oxford degree.

Briefing For The Scholars On Their Graduation Day At Kellogg College, Oxford University

0:04:45.460,0:04:49.560
The briefing over, Yinka walks confidently down the same road

0:04:49.560,0:04:53.600
as thousands of other Oxford scholars have done before her.

0:04:53.600,0:04:59.100
Many of whom went on to become world leaders and history makers.

0:04:59.100,0:05:01.740
Having walked down the streets of Oxford,

0:05:01.740,0:05:06.620
the graduates with those accompanying them arrive at the Sheldonian Theatre,

0:05:06.620,0:05:12.460
the principal assembly room in the university where all public ceremonies are performed.

0:05:12.460,0:05:17.100
Yinka Makes Her Way To The Sheldonian Theatre Where The Graduation Ceremony Will Take Place

0:05:17.100,0:05:22.820
The scholars in their academic dress enter a private entrance to the Sheldonian Theatre,

0:05:22.820,0:05:26.400
each carrying their graduation robes in a special bag,

0:05:26.400,0:05:30.360
each colour signifying the academic level they achieved.

0:05:30.360,0:05:35.340
All of which shall be donned or worn at the invitation from the College Council

0:05:35.340,0:05:37.900
as their degrees are granted to them.

0:05:37.900,0:05:40.680
It's obviously a great day for all of you

0:05:40.680,0:05:47.300
to celebrate your academic achievement with your family and friends.

0:05:47.300,0:05:55.140
In this wonderful building, the Sheldonian Theatre at the heart of our ancient university;

0:05:55.140,0:05:59.760
ancient but still very relevant to the problems of the modern world,

0:05:59.760,0:06:03.180
pushing back the frontiers of knowledge.

0:06:03.180,0:06:09.760
I hope you've all enjoyed your years at Oxford - quite difficult not to do so, I think.

0:06:09.760,0:06:15.300
You'd have to have pretty stunted ambitions and interests not enjoy your time here.

0:06:15.300,0:06:22.340
And I hope those of you who come back to continue your studies will also have a great time.

0:06:22.340,0:06:29.320
As you know, we regard everybody who has been a member of the university as a continuing member.

0:06:29.320,0:06:31.760
A university is a living thing.

0:06:31.760,0:06:34.820
Once you're part of our community, you continue to be.

0:06:34.820,0:06:41.160
So, I very much hope hat you'll keep in touch with your college and with the university

0:06:41.160,0:06:44.060
as your careers develop in the years ahead

0:06:44.060,0:06:50.680
I hope you'll go to Alumni events from time to time, even when people like me are speaking at them!

0:06:50.680,0:06:56.600
To be serious, we're very proud of you and we know we will be even more proud in the future.

0:06:56.600,0:07:01.160
Oxford is a great world-class university.

0:07:01.160,0:07:05.160
and one of the ways in which we have defined that over the years

0:07:05.160,0:07:10.200
is that we send people into the world who help to make it a better place.

0:07:10.200,0:07:18.460
I'm sure that you'll be doing that; you'll have all our support in whatever field of activity you choose

0:07:18.460,0:07:21.240
for your own next round of achievements.

0:07:21.240,0:07:53.620
THE OXFORD DEGREE CEREMONY

0:07:53.620,0:08:24.760
Graduation Ceremony of Dr Yinka Oduwole, Oxford University, UK, Sept 16, 2017

0:08:24.760,0:08:26.360
Please be seated.

0:08:26.360,0:08:31.760
Graduation Ceremony of Dr Yinka Oduwole, Oxford University, UK, Sept 16, 2017

0:08:31.760,0:08:37.860
The degree ceremony for higher degrees starts with the supplication, traditionally made in Latin

0:08:37.860,0:08:43.480
by the senior proctor for the candidates to be admitted to their respective degrees.

0:08:43.480,0:08:50.840
Before we begin the degree day itself, I want to say just a few words, words of  congratulations.

0:08:50.840,0:08:56.340
This is of course a proud moment for you all - for you, your families, friends and supporters.

0:08:56.340,0:09:00.060
A moment of exceptional pleasure, to be savoured at length

0:09:00.060,0:09:03.740
and preserved photographically for posterity.

0:09:03.740,0:09:08.820
The degree day is certainly the happiest of the ceremonies in the university calender.

0:09:08.820,0:09:13.920
Unlike the great burst of relief that everyone feels after examinations,

0:09:13.920,0:09:20.820
this a time to recognize and mark formally the personal achievement of gaining a degree.

0:09:20.820,0:09:24.460
We shall see conferred here today quite a range of different degrees

0:09:24.460,0:09:27.100
from Bachelor of Arts to Doctorates.

0:09:27.100,0:09:29.160
But they all have this in common:

0:09:29.160,0:09:35.020
They are all the product of a sustained effort, the application of the mind to complex problems

0:09:35.020,0:09:39.400
and a determination to overcome difficulties.

0:09:39.400,0:09:44.320
Oxford is one of a mere handful of great international universities in the world.

0:09:44.320,0:09:48.680
Our entry requirements are exacting; our courses are demanding;

0:09:48.680,0:09:52.720
our research programmes are uncompromising.

0:09:52.720,0:09:57.660
The opportunities are great in Oxford with its special qualities, its international mix

0:09:57.660,0:10:01.560
and the close involvement of academics in the work of students.

0:10:01.560,0:10:04.380
But the challenges are great also.

0:10:04.380,0:10:11.920
Oxford is not a place, nor does it want to be where a student may rely on being told what to think.

0:10:11.920,0:10:15.260
So, it's not easy to get any sort of degree here.

0:10:15.260,0:10:20.520
Those who teach and research in Oxford know that and they would want me to say to you

0:10:20.520,0:10:25.360
on their behalf that the degree you received today is indeed a considerable

0:10:25.360,0:10:30.080
personal achievement and that you are right to take pride in it.

0:10:30.080,0:10:35.020
In fact, of course, others have contributed to the outcome being recognised here.

0:10:35.020,0:10:40.640
I want most particularly to welcome the families and friends whom I see with us.

0:10:40.640,0:10:44.160
The fact that you are here testifies to your support of

0:10:44.160,0:10:48.220
and commitment to one of the people in front of me.

0:10:48.220,0:10:51.120
Those who study need support and encouragement.

0:10:51.120,0:10:56.540
They need timely comfort and unaffected approval from those closest to them.

0:10:56.540,0:11:00.200
For all of you, support has meant financial sacrifice

0:11:00.200,0:11:02.740
and perhaps the rearrangement of plans.

0:11:02.740,0:11:10.480
So, I do want to recognize that the success we celebrate today also belongs to you.

0:11:10.480,0:11:14.920
I think that the degrees we are giving here represent two things:

0:11:14.920,0:11:20.140
First, they certify that a number of specific skills have been acquired and tested.

0:11:20.140,0:11:24.620
Indeed the formulas that I shall use in a minute's time to confer degrees

0:11:24.620,0:11:29.240
essentially refer to them as licenses to do certain things.

0:11:29.240,0:11:36.060
Most important however, an Oxford degree reflects our intention to promote some qualities of mind.

0:11:36.060,0:11:39.840
 

0:11:39.840,0:11:43.780
to teach people how to learn, how to take charge of their thought

0:11:43.780,0:11:47.920
to teach people how to learn, how to take charge of their thought

0:11:47.920,0:11:52.860
What you know is not as important as what you do with what you know.

0:11:52.860,0:11:57.980
The crucial but also the most difficult qualities towards which we try to help our students

0:11:57.980,0:12:01.380
are understanding, independence of judgement

0:12:01.380,0:12:06.220
are understanding, independence of judgement

0:12:06.220,0:12:10.520
These are the qualities which you carry out from here with your degree.

0:12:10.520,0:12:13.680
These are the qualities which will sustain you in a life

0:12:13.680,0:12:18.500
during which we now know more direct skills will have to be often renewed.

0:12:18.500,0:12:22.940
And these are the qualities which a stable and successful society needs

0:12:22.940,0:12:26.300
And these are the qualities which a stable and successful society needs

0:12:26.300,0:12:32.740
in each successive generation.

0:12:32.740,0:12:36.320
This event is very ceremonial and solemn here.

0:12:36.320,0:12:39.980
Degree days do not have to be so and in some universities,

0:12:39.980,0:12:43.580
they can be quite informal and noisy festivals.

0:12:43.580,0:12:46.700
We think that solemn ceremony is proper

0:12:46.700,0:12:50.920
because the university is bestowing that which is most precious to it

0:12:50.920,0:12:55.080
that which carries the values we proclaim and defend.

0:12:55.080,0:12:57.780
that which carries the values we proclaim and defend.

0:12:57.780,0:13:01.340
We think it is proper because we are paying respect

0:13:01.340,0:13:05.520
to those who have earned that precious prize from us.

0:13:05.520,0:13:09.160
which is the way we show respect in the university.

0:13:09.160,0:13:15.120
The ceremony is also in latin; at first sight, that may appear to you impossibly old-fashioned

0:13:15.120,0:13:19.740
The ceremony is also in latin; at first sight, that may appear to you impossibly old-fashioned

0:13:19.740,0:13:22.720
Let me persuade you of the contrary.

0:13:22.720,0:13:26.900
The university has been in existence for the better part of 800 years.

0:13:26.900,0:13:30.700
I'm not speaking simply of the longevity of an institution.

0:13:30.700,0:13:34.660
but primarily of the the long continuity of an ideal.

0:13:34.660,0:13:38.720
Through shifting circumstances and with varying success,

0:13:38.720,0:13:44.040
the university has sought values of intellectual honesty, independence of judgement,

0:13:44.040,0:13:46.960
the university has sought values of intellectual honesty, independence of judgement,

0:13:46.960,0:13:52.780
and truth - imperfect though each generation's test of that has proved to be.

0:13:52.780,0:13:57.940
and truth - imperfect though each generation's test of that has proved to be.

0:13:57.940,0:14:01.100
with the words with which degrees have always been awarded

0:14:01.100,0:14:04.500
with the words with which degrees have always been awarded

0:14:04.500,0:14:08.860
The robes that will soon display your degree resemble those of your colleagues,

0:14:08.860,0:14:13.940
The robes that will soon display your degree resemble those of your colleagues,

0:14:13.940,0:14:19.460
Thus, latin and robes symbolise two essential things:

0:14:19.460,0:14:23.060
First, the perenity of certain necessary values.

0:14:23.060,0:14:28.820
First, the perenity of certain necessary values.

0:14:28.820,0:14:35.340
and will in future stand to hear these self-same words ad don these self-same robes.

0:14:35.340,0:14:37.520
and will in future stand to hear these self-same words ad don these self-same robes.

0:14:37.520,0:14:41.860
Before I turn to the Registrar to begin the ceremony in latin,

0:14:41.860,0:14:46.200
just one more word and that is, congratulations!

0:14:46.200,0:15:03.380
just one more word and that is, congratulations!

Hello, Viewers! Thank you so much for following me on this journey.

0:21:03.060,0:21:08.420
I just finished the graduation ceremony held at The Sheldonian Theatre.

0:21:08.420,0:21:12.240
I have just been confirmed a Doctor in Engineering Science.

0:21:12.240,0:21:16.380

I'm from California.

0:21:23.680,0:21:27.580
I feel happy that I got my degree but sad that I'm done with my course.

0:21:27.580,0:21:32.000
I feel excited to continue my life with a degree from Oxford.

Hi. My name is Jessica Thorn from Namibia.

0:21:37.160,0:21:40.220
I graduated in zoology.

0:21:40.220,0:21:47.940
I specialised in climate adaption and the impact on small holders in Nepal, Ghana and Kenya.

0:21:47.940,0:21:51.600
I just graduated today. It's been a wonderful ceremony.

0:21:51.600,0:21:54.740
It's wonderful to be here with my family to celebrate,

0:21:54.740,0:22:04.400
going to such a historic institution with so much diversity and international contributions.

0:22:04.400,0:22:12.460
It's being part of a network of people who are very dedicated and have taken a lot of sacrifices

0:22:12.460,0:22:18.600
to be able to contribute to a bigger body of thought and continued conversation

0:22:18.600,0:22:25.600
about humanitarian issues, about trying to create a more sustainable way of producing food,

0:22:25.600,0:22:31.620
to producing a more integrated way of nature and livelihoods.

0:22:31.620,0:22:34.700
I am very grateful to be a part of this process.

0:22:34.700,0:22:36.400
My name is Dr Jessica Thorn.

0:22:36.400,0:22:39.740

My name is Edward Still. I'm from Bristol.

0:22:44.100,0:22:49.540
I just got my DPhil in Modern Medieval Languages here at Oxford.

0:22:49.540,0:22:53.680
It's the pinnacle of my studies so far, so I'm very chuffed and pleased.

0:22:53.680,0:22:56.180
It's a great honour.

0:22:56.180,0:22:59.180
My name is Zahid. I'm Canadian-born.

0:22:59.180,0:23:01.060
I did my undergraduate in Toronto

0:23:01.060,0:23:05.740
and then came to Oxford to do a Masters and PhD, both in Neuroscience.

0:23:05.740,0:23:11.860
It's been an amazing experience. I've learnt a lot about the research, about the brain.

0:23:11.860,0:23:17.020
My particular focus was looking at the cellular molecular basis of learning and memory.

0:23:17.020,0:23:24.300
After four years, I was able to discover very interesting rules that govern

0:23:24.300,0:23:28.760
how people are able to remember things for long periods of time.

0:23:28.760,0:23:33.560
I'm off to do a post-doctoral work in Edinburgh University

0:23:33.560,0:23:39.680
and ultimately my goal is to become an academic and a professor of Neuroscience.

0:23:39.680,0:23:46.100
My name is Zahid Padamsey, and I graduated today from Oxford University with a DPhil in Neuroscience.

Keep watching Emmanuel TV!

0:23:57.540,0:24:03.520
After the graduation ceremony, the new graduates and doctors return to their various colleges

0:24:03.520,0:24:08.580
to celebrate with friends and family as well as Oxford professors and academics.

0:24:08.580,0:24:12.860
One of the most prominent among them is Professor Jeffrey Thomas,

0:24:12.860,0:24:16.880
the founder and first president of Kellogg College.

0:24:16.880,0:24:26.220
What a pleasure it is to see Yinka graduate, to become one of the very unusual young ladies

0:24:26.220,0:24:29.760
who has got a DPhil from the University of Oxford

0:24:29.760,0:24:34.020
and I am delighted that she became a member of this college.

0:24:34.020,0:24:41.640
I had the great opportunity a few years ago of helping to found what is now Kellogg College.

0:24:41.640,0:24:48.560
It was founded precisely to give opportunities to people from the United Kingdom

0:24:48.560,0:24:55.280
who wanted to study part-time and to younger folk from all over the world, such as Yinka.

0:24:55.280,0:24:59.980
And I have to say that since Yinka has been here, she has been an absolute star.

0:24:59.980,0:25:01.440
She's been here four years.

0:25:01.440,0:25:06.140
She's joined in everything, very important in the social life of the college

0:25:06.140,0:25:09.580
and absolutely brilliant in her academics.

0:25:09.580,0:25:17.300
I am delighted to see her moving on to what I am sure will be a glittering career.

0:25:17.300,0:25:24.640
So I want to say: Any more folks you have at home like Yinka, please send them to Kellogg College.

0:25:24.640,0:25:26.360
We would be delighted to see them all.

0:25:26.360,0:25:29.840
Congratulations Yinka! Come back and see us often!

0:25:29.840,0:25:33.220
Dr Yinka With Professor Geoffrey Thomas
Founder & First President of Kellogg College, Oxford

0:25:33.220,0:25:35.560
And I will shake hands now. Well done.

0:25:35.560,0:25:36.840
Thank you.

0:25:36.840,0:25:38.360
Brilliant.

0:25:38.360,0:25:42.600
My name is Professor Tom Buchanan. I'm the acting President of Kellogg College.

0:25:42.600,0:25:47.200
I have been a fellow here since just after the college was set up in 1990.

0:25:47.200,0:25:53.640
We are very pleased to honour today the success of all our students

0:25:53.640,0:25:58.160
and in particular delighted with the success of the student you've sponsored, Yinka,

0:25:58.160,0:26:01.120
in achieving her DPhil.

0:26:01.120,0:26:06.160
The college is the largest graduate college in the University of Oxford

0:26:06.160,0:26:09.780
and has grown very rapidly since it was set up in 1990.

0:26:09.780,0:26:16.240
We have a very marvellous group of students and we are delighted with the success of all of them today.

0:26:16.240,0:26:21.540
The acting president of Kellogg College Professor Tom Buchanan presents Dr Yinka

0:26:21.540,0:26:25.080
with her official certificate and congratulates her.

0:26:25.080,0:26:28.720
My name is Dr Gary Tonge, and we are here in the UK.

0:26:28.720,0:26:33.220
Today, we have been celebrating the graduation of Yinka

0:26:33.220,0:26:38.140
where she has been admitted as a Doctor of Philosophy  in the University of Oxford

0:26:38.140,0:26:42.020
which is actually the most prestigious university in the world.

0:26:42.020,0:26:48.840
We're very very proud on her behalf and rejoicing along with Emmanuel TV Partners

0:26:48.840,0:26:55.400
and Prophet T.B Joshua, who have had the privilege to support her on this amazing journey.

0:26:55.400,0:27:00.960
As a PhD myself, I know how much work is involved.

0:27:00.960,0:27:04.540
I know how much toil and energy is involved

0:27:04.540,0:27:08.940
and now Yinka is no longer a scholar, student.

0:27:08.940,0:27:13.920
She's actually someone who is generating her own ideas, her own research.

0:27:13.920,0:27:15.860
She's not just studying other people;

0:27:15.860,0:27:20.880
she's now admitted to the most prestigious academic community in the world.

0:27:20.880,0:27:22.620
We're very, very proud of her.

0:27:22.620,0:27:25.940
Hello, I'm Mrs Fiona Tonge.

0:27:25.940,0:27:29.860
What can I say? My husband, Dr Gary, has said it all.

0:27:29.860,0:27:36.160
It truly has been a privilege to follow Yinka's progress over the years she's been in the UK.

0:27:36.160,0:27:41.340
What can we say? All glory goes to God and thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua

0:27:41.340,0:27:47.360
and all the Emmanuel TV Partners for such an amazing sponsorship

0:27:47.360,0:27:51.680
of this very, very, hugely talented girl.

0:27:51.680,0:27:56.180
- Congratulations, Yinka! A wonderful achievement.
- Thank you.

0:27:56.180,0:27:59.680
I just graduated from Oxford University.

0:27:59.680,0:28:06.400
I was one of four students that actually got a doctorate degree from Kellogg College.

0:28:06.400,0:28:08.940
My degree was in Engineering Science.

0:28:08.940,0:28:12.460
I was awarded the degree this afternoon and it was four years

0:28:12.460,0:28:15.620
and during the four years, there were lots of challenges

0:28:15.620,0:28:20.760
but because of the teaching and mentorship I received from Prophet T.B. Joshua,

0:28:20.760,0:28:24.200
today it's a success as you can see and testify to.

0:28:24.200,0:28:28.340
I just want to say thank you so much for making this journey a success.

0:28:28.340,0:28:31.560
It wouldn't have been possible without your support. Thank you.

0:28:31.560,0:28:36.160
I'm just going to show you my name on the programme list.

0:28:36.160,0:28:39.840
I was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science.

0:28:39.840,0:28:46.600
My name is here: Dr Olayinka Oduwole. As you can see here, under Kellog College.

0:28:46.600,0:28:48.780
It's a PhD in Engineering Science

0:28:48.780,0:28:53.840
and at the moment, I'm doing a research fellowship at the University of Surrey

0:28:53.840,0:28:56.380
where I'm involved in research and teaching.

0:28:56.380,0:29:03.400
Congratulations, Dr Yinka! Cheers!
